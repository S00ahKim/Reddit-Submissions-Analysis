Hope you are all having a great evening. So I am a 1st year Kinesiology student and I have just been thinking about what I would like to do with my degree.

On one hand, I find the Computer Science stuff really interesting, working on problems and solving them to create new things. It all seems really cool.

My only issue is my weakness in Math. I took Grade 12 Functions and I finished with a 63% in the class. I just found that I was struggling with the course content, and I just wasn't getting it, no matter how hard I tried. I had gotten tutoring too but, I was still getting 60s and 50s on tests. I have also never taken a Calculus class.

I found applied math (like Physics) to be a bit easier, but I only took grade 11 Physics and got about a 70%.

For example, for taking the integer square root of n, you might think to do an unbounded search over k for a solution to k^2 &gt; n and then subtract 1. But this will check every single number between 0 and the final result, which very impractical. Does anyone know of a better implementation using partial recursive functions? I know of faster methods for computing the square root, but not how to implement them this way. I'm also trying to find efficient algorithms for integer division, while I'm at it.

The ultimate purpose of this is that I would like to construct a universal partial recursive function and actually run it. This will require having my partial recursive functions manipulate very large numbers, so having efficient algorithms is crucial.",2,1

Say I have an nxm ""grid"" where n and m are integers, and may be equal to each-other. Now suppose I have p points , where p must be less than nxm. I place these p points randomly throughout the nxm grid. My goal is to find the outer-most path, given only the points.

An example would be that Im given:

\[(0, 1) , (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7), (3,3), (4,6)\] = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

and its solution would be the path 1-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;9-&gt;7-&gt;3-&gt;1. Starting position does not matter, just the order.

My solution idea went like this:

Given:

(index starts at zero for computation purposes)

\[(0, 1) , (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7), (3,3), (4,6)\]

Step 1:

convert points into an array:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0

0 4 0 0 5 0 0 6 7

0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0

Step 2:

Find point in highest row (point 9)

Step 3:

check points to the top right, if none, check points above, starting from the right, ...

Here i realized that this would be an awfully efficient solution. I would need several for-loops and I don't seem to be tackling the problem directly. Intuition tells me i can do some math given just:

\[(0, 1) , (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7), (3,3), (4,6)\]

I could possibly create a line from each point and take the angles between those lines, and starting from the right I pick the point with the smallest counter-clockwise angle to the horizontal, but once again this is ""exhaustive"".

My mathematical background includes multivariable analysis, PDE's, combinatorics, linear algebra, and programming in three languages. Id like for someone to lead me in the right direction, not tell me the answer. even telling me what area of math this falls under or a link to a paper would help. I was considering the fact of converting this into a matrix and applying matrix operations, but once again im not sure if thats a point to tackle.

I hope you are all doing really well today, basically I just wanted to ask for advice on really if Computer Science is for me.

Every time I do a google search and see a Quora post come up regarding CS its always the same thing saying that you need amazing Math skills to do CS. I don't deny that you need math skills but I just kind of feel like I am at a crossroads.

I haven't ever programmed before in my life, I got Bs in Math but in Grade 12 (last year, Advanced Functions/Pre-Calculus I suppose) I got a C-.

I just feel like I really like the idea of tech, and all its possibilities, but its going to overwhelm me. I know if I apply myself maybe I can do it, but I just don't know.

I talked to my Academic Advisor and he said since I am in the BA side, and looking through the required classes, I don't even need calculus, but I feel like I am scared. I'm scared of failure and making the wrong choice. 

I don't hate my major (Kinesiology), but I feel like I'm just going through the motions with it. Like I can't see myself in any career with it. I don't know.

I'd like to see myself working on Programming with a team, that seems like a lot of fun, but every time I look online it just says that either you were programming from the womb or you are the next Pythagoras when it comes to math.

I dunno, I just kinda feel like I'm stuck and don't know what to do.

I'm taking Coding for Problem Solving as an elective next semester but I have a worry in the back of my mind that even if I like it, because its easy the upper level classes will ruin me, because of the math.

Hope you're all having a nice Tuesday! So recently I went and saw my academic adviser regarding Computer Science and what if I decided to switch. Turns out I have lots of time to make a decision, and I don't really need to choose until the beginning of 2nd year, if I want to change majors.

The only thing really is just I have some fears about the program. I've read online, like on Quora, etc. that if you weren't A) Programming at like 4 years old, and B) If you didn't get A's in math, don't even bother.

As some of you may know from me posting here, I will be taking a CS elective next semester, but I'm worried that even if I do like it, and I do switch into CS, that I will do bad in all the other classes, like Intro to Programming, and all the upper year classes.

As for math, I don't need Calculus surprisingly. I need ""Graphs, Functions, Geometry"" and ""Sets, Logic, Number Theory"" at the 100 level and then Matrix Algebra in 2nd year. (I'm doing a BA, so the other maths aren't required.)

I just don't want to make a mistake and then fail out of school because its too hard for me or something, but I also don't want to earn a degree (my current, Kinesiology) where I don't even think I could do any tech, considering I wouldn't qualify for any tech related Masters.

I think I've got a computer virus that compresses things against my will  and I was wondering if someone on this forum could help. TLDR at bottom. Is this the correct place to post about this?  


I first noticed when media files (youtube videos, Amazon radio, offline  WAV, mp3 and mp4 files) would not play back correctly. When I pressed  play, the play button would turn to a pause button like the video was  meant to be playing, but I'd see about 1 frame every couple of seconds  with no sound.   
 

Next I noticed that files on my desktop had been compressed, and that  actually throughout my C drive quite a few files had been compressed.  
 

My suspicion is that codecs in the Windows folder have been compressed by a virus, so media won't play back properly.  
 

Antivirus (Avast, Malwarebytes) has not found anything. GPU driver,  Windows, Adobe are up to date. I don't have restore points to use system  restore. I could do a system refresh or reinstall, but seeing as I have  about 3TB of programs and data that would take at least a week to  redownload this would be a last resort.  
 

Just a little bit more background and where the virus \*might\* have come  from: I noticed around August that my Android phone's SD card started  playing up. I could write files to it, but they wouldn't read from it. I  formatted the card in my PC, but the error was still there so i figured  it was a faulty SD card. A couple of months later (which brings us to  last Saturday) I plugged it into my computer just to check it wasn't a  problem with my phone and to try and play back one of the videos  recorded onto the SD. This is the first time on my PC that I noticed the  issue of a media file not playing back correctly as described above,  but I figured it was because the SD card was faulty. Now I am wondering  if there was a virus on the SD card that had a chance to transfer onto  my system when I played the video file, but not when I formatted it a  couple of months ago. I'm usually quite careful with the websites I  visit etc, so I would still be surprised to find a virus on my SD card,  but it's possible an app from the Play store could have contained a  virus. Or could the SD card have corrupted my computer files without any  viruses being involved?  
 

TLDR: I am wondering if perhaps I can  address the symptoms by asking Windows to decompress everything on the C  drive, whether it is already uncompressed or not (because at the moment  not everything has been compressed by the 'virus'). It would take many  hours to manually go through every file and try to decompress it because  this unwanted compression has affected the Windows folder, hence why it  would be nice to do a blanket decompress on the whole drive.

 The C: drive  has 11GB out of 100GB space left, so I don't think it's that. I  used the command prompt instruction to try and decompress all of C:  but I just got this:   
 

"" C:\\WINDOWS\\system32&gt;compact /u ""C:\\Windows"" /I /Q  
 

 Uncompressing files in C:\\  
 

0 files within 1 directories were uncompressed. ""

Project-3
Objective:
Learn to exercise components on the controller e.g, LEDs, 8-segments, and LCD, take inputs 
from the keypad and display output to 8-segments, LEDs and LCD. Allocate memory 
dynamically for pressed numbers if needed and must use functions and stack. Assign the keys as 
shown below use only digits 0  9 and minus (-) or plus (+) keys. Remaining keys are not 
applicable.
The Keypad map is assumed to be numbered as shown below:
 7 8 9 -
 4 5 6 +
 1 2 3 N/A
N/A 0 N/A N/A
Pressing any of the black buttons will reset the system to initial start state by clearing the 8 
segments and the LCD display. Pressing any of N/A buttons will display a message on the LCD 
indicating that wrong key is pressed, use digits from 0 to 9 or +/- keys. Try again. Once a 
valid key is pressed the previous message will be cleared and if the pressed key was a digit then 
the eight segment will display the digit, and on LCD the total will be displayed with the word 
added (default state is +), however, before entering a digit if minus (-) was pressed and then a 
digit is pressed the eight segment will display the digit, and LCD will display the subtracted 
total. If it happens the number becomes negative, the LCD should display the total negative 
number. Example:
At start pressed 9:
- 8-segments will display 9, and LCD will display Addition total = 9
- Then if 5 is pressed, 8-segments will display 5 and LCD will display Addition total = 
14.
- If minus (-) is pressed the 8 segments will be cleared and the LCD will display 
Subtraction total = 14
- If 8 is pressed the 8-segments will display 8 and the LCD will display Subtraction 
total = 6
- If 9 is pressed the 8-segments will display 9 and the LCD will display Subtraction 
total = -3.
NOTE:
Each time any digit key is pressed both red LEDs should blink to indicate that a digit is pressed. 
If the left black button is pressed only the left LED should blink.
If the right black button is pressed only the right LED should blink.
Pressing plus (+) or minus (-) operator should not blink.",0,1

Ive taken 8 math classes since I started (we do quarterly years here). There were times I didnt think Id make it but I studied a LOT, watched countless YouTube videos, exhausted google, went to tutoring sessions, went to office hours, the list goes on.

Tomorrow, Im taking my final exam for the last math class required for my degree. Im more than ready for it.

If youre interested in CS, dont let the math discourage you. No one is a natural. Anyone who is good at math worked very hard to learn it, and it may be different for other students, but it actually got easier as I took harder classes.

But since I do not have experience of working at a big product company yet, so I wanted ask a couple of things: 

1. How is the day to day working experience at a 'Big N' company different from that at small startups or consulting companies?

2. And so, as a result of never having worked at a big product company, apart from topics in the Bachelors in CS curriculum, what other skills am I missing that will be required while working at a 'Big N' company, that I should be learning over the coming year?

I'm hoping someone here can help make sense of this. 

According to our teacher, there are two main parts to a heap sort. Building the heap, and deleting each member of the heap 1 by 1 in order, due to the property of heaps having the largest/smallest number at the top. 

He said deleting and adding a node to a heap takes O(lg(n)) which makes sense. Then he claims that building a heap of *n* elements takes O(n), and deleting that heap takes O(lg(n)) and then you multiply the two together to get O(nlg(n)). 

According to my understanding of big-O both parts should take O(nlgn), and you add both together to get just O(nlgn), but he claims his way is correct. 

I've asked other teachers for help, and only thing we could find was that a different algorithm than the one explained in class can build a heap in O(n), but no one can explain why deleting a heap takes only O(lgn) and why you multiply the complexities.

Have two models for predicting so far but they aren't great at predicting by any measurement. My loss function is returning 28.3 or something after 10k epochs if that makes any sense to you.
My first model takes in tensor (player_offense_rank, player_avgFantasyPoints, weather, opp_defense_rank) and returns a tensor that contains a float predicted fantasy points acquired that game value.
Second model takes in tensor (player fantasy avg, over under for the game, vegas betting line (so minus x if favored and plus x if not favored)

As you can see they are all float values because the model im using only takes floats. So things like player names, positions, team names, and the like are hard to represent.

I need help deciding on a model format that will give me the best predictions. What should my input be? I'm scraping data from https://www.pro-football-reference.com

121,2018-12-7,2018,12,7,8,a3tzb6,Partial-order preserving hash / optimizing string comparisons,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/a3tzb6/partialorder_preserving_hash_optimizing_string/,cbarrick,1544140404,"I am developing a system which performs frequent string comparisons. For a long time, I've been thinking of possible ways to optimize these comparisons.

Inb4 ""just compare the strings"": I will implement direct string comparisons first, and I honestly imagine performance to be acceptable. I am asking this question because I'm interested in the related theoretical problems.

### The problem

I think the best way to describe the problem in terms of hashing.

Lets define an order preserving hash as a function `h: string -&gt; integer` such that if `str_a &lt; str_b` then `h(str_a) &lt; h(str_b)`. This is a special case of [perfect hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function). The CHM algorithm [1] can generate order-preserving perfect hash functions.

But there is a problem. The range of a perfect hash must be at least as large as the domain. This is a non-starter if we want to support the (infinite) set arbitrary strings. Additionally, most perfect hash functions, including those generated by the CHM algorithm, require the domain to be known before generating the hash function (though dynamic/online perfect hashing is a thing). I explicitly need an online function.

So our only recourse is to weaken the requirements. We can define a partial-order preserving hash as a function `h: string -&gt; integer` such that if `str_a &lt; str_b` then `h(str_a) &lt;= h(str_b)`. This breaks us out of the requirements of a perfect hash by allowing hashcodes to collide.

But how do we create a partial-order preserving hash?

[1]: Z.J. Czech, G. Havas, and B.S. Majewski. *An optimal algorithm for generating minimal perfect hash functions*, Information Processing Letters, 43(5):257-264, 1992. 

### A naive solution

My first idea is to build a binary search tree and at insertion time generate an integer that corresponds to the path within the tree. When hashing a string, we search the tree. If we find the string, we also find its hashcode. If we don't find the string, we insert it into the tree with a new hashcode that is the midpoint of the hashcodes for the elements to the left and right. If there is no left/right element, use the maximum or minimum value. Since we're using integer hashcodes, rounding the midpoint could cause a collision.

This seems ok at first, but I think it's susceptible to some pathological cases because the hashcodes depend on the order that the strings are encountered. For example, if the first string in the sort order is encountered first, then its hashcode will be the midpoint of the range, and no other string will be hashed into the first half of the range.

I think I can overcome some of those pitfalls by seeding the tree with some initial strings. I do have an idea of the order and distribution of strings that will be encountered, including the string I expect to see first and other strings I expect to see early on.

My biggest problem is that I don't know how to analyze the worst and expected cases in terms of number of collisions. In the worst case, if I use 64 bit integers, then I think I can hash at least 64 strings before triggering a collision, but I also think its possible for every hash after that to be a collision! For the ""expected"" case, if the strings are drawn uniformly, how many can I expect to hash before a collision? And just in general, what's the best way to go about analyzing this scheme?

### Is there something better?

Have you encountered this kind of problem before? Is there a better way to solve it?

I am just finishing up my first semester after switching to a computer science program. I enjoyed the basic programming course I took but there are a few problems. 

First of all, I do not want to pursue a career in areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, cyber security, or game development. I'm thinking more along the lines of android app development, mobile development, web development or computer programming. Is a computer science major overkill for those careers? Should I just get a bachelors degree in software engineering or web development instead? 

Secondly, I really enjoy having outdoor hobbies such as longboarding, snowboarding and landscape photography and I work out 4-5 days a week. From what I've read, if you're a programmer, you are going to be spending a lot of your free time learning new technologies, new languages and practicing your coding skills. I am afraid that, because I might be constantly be worn out and because I will be surrounding myself with people who just code or game on their free time and are pretty unhealthy, I will start to become one of them and that I will stop doing anything active regularly. 

So I have a few questions:

1. Are my concerns reasonable? 
2. Do web developers have a more healthy lifestyle and more free time on average compared to computer programmers, A.I. programmers, etc.?
3. Would you recommend switching to from computer science to a bachelors degree in something like software development or web development/design?",6,1

I'd give the overall experience a 5/10.

Little background about me. I started a double major Business and Law, but never really liked it all that much. So I finished that but never actually got around to working in that specific field. I got really depressed about my lack of perspectives for quite a while (year and a half). After my mental health got a little better, I started to look for jobs that may interest me.

I always had the entrepreneurial ""what if"" in my brain, and always looked up to coders. It seemed so cool and challenging from the outside. I started getting my head into it a little bit, but felt very overwhelmed. I did not really know where to start or what steps to follow. That's when I read about the whole bootcamp thing happening in the US. I read both good and bad opinions about it, so I decided to try them myself.

First of all, I'm from Spain, so my experience has happened here in Madrid, where IMO the saturation of these have not arrived yet.

Anyway, the bootcamp itself provided a warranty of 100% employment, so I said ""well, that's good"" and enrolled. The duration was 3 months and I told myself ""so 100% employment after a 3-month course? That's great!"".

The whole thing started with a ""review"" of an online course they made us do on HTML and CSS, and that lasted around a week. After that we went straight into vanilla JS, and right after that, they taught us Angular. In terms of front-end we were also taught Bootstrap, SASS and Semantic. THen the back end part arrived, to my surprise only when we were 3 weeks from finishing. They just went really fast with MySQL, NodeJS, MongoDB. Finally they shoewed us a bit of the framework Ionic, for mobile development, so we could get a glimpse of what developing for a cellphone would look like.

The whole thing had to end with a full-stack project, which needless to say, did by myself with the help of internet resources.


So, my opinion. It's just too much stuff for a 3 month period. You end up just barely knowing the stuff, and becoming a master of none. I've been asked in telephone interviews what my experience was, and it just seemed stupid when I'd tell them everything I've just told you in this post. Had they asked me anything in particular about those technologies I'd have probably fainted.

Now I'm just skeptic as to what my job prospects are, at least as my first position. They did sign a contract with the 100% employment thing.

Overall, I've found Udemy and personal prjects to be the best source of learning. In terms of books, Ive only been able to read ""Javascript: from novice to ninja"" and it's been of great help.

I belive that it is essential to master the basics of programming itself since those will always be the foundation of any programming language, and I've only found that out myself. The first JS class was like ""OK. So JS is programming language which uses variables to..."" and I was like ""mmm... ok. Give me a little background here?"".

I don't know. I'm a little disappointed in myself for believeing that I'd know my shit after 3 months. Now I'm considering the idea of getting into CS degree at 25 years old. It's never late, and I really like the field, but I think it'd be better for me to learn everything from scratch.

Hope this helped to those who are considering the idea of joining a coding bootcamp. The Internet is your friend, and bootcamps nowadays don't give you much of a credential. Luckily, in this field it's all about experience,and not certificates. Despite all that, I'd really like to get into the degree. I feel like that's my true call.

In addition to the above, both specializations also contain some unique courses and 4 electives:  

DS: Data science (a course in which a full data science pipeline is taught, from collecting data to visualization), randomized algorithms and data analysis, elements of machine learning.  

General CS: Development of Information Systems, Implementation of Programming Languages, Programming Language Design.

I am in my final year (just completed 7th semester) of my undergrad ( computer Engineering) . 

I want to make a career in machine learning (AI). I know about Andrew NG's courses and fast.ai ( Jeremy Howard, and other books/resources. I am also interested in data science ( as I think I have good analytical ability and I like mathematics), also enrolled in Datacamp for the same. 

I did not know about programming in school(as it was not offered/taught + no one in my acquaintance [friends , relativies , family] knowing about it) , not until my 2nd year of college, although I had access to computers and Internet from around grade 5th. During my 8th grade I knew about torrents, and in 11th grade I knew about rooting, custom ROMs, and similar stuff). I used google whenever the need came but never thought of creating the softwares/websites I was using. But I always loved computers and Technology so I thought of doing something related to it after my schooling.

Because of not working hard in class 12th ( and also due to reservation in India + discrimination to my Board of education during admissions + my family can't afford costly private colleges or donations), so I did not go to a good college/university.

Now coming to my college life. I joined IEEE during my first year. Went to many events organised by IEEE in my country ( hackathons , national level conferences, summer schools, etc. ). I became Microsoft Student partner in my 5th semester and am till now. Started competitive programming in 6th semester ( mainly on Codechef).  Went to many college's Techfest and won in several events( I know it is nothing an achievement). Won a prize in hackathon , got selected as fast.ai international fellow, cleared Codechef Certified data structure and algorithms programme ( foundation level), current 3 star rating at Codechef. I was member of Google developer group ( Ahmedabad and Baroda).

As I did not know about programming in school I went to organise an Hour of Code session at my school,  encouraging my juniors to start working on competitive programming and mainly focus on concepts of core tech( any 1 programming language + operating system + computer networks + data structures and algorithms). I even conducted and co-ordinated several workshops and seminars for Students at my college and also at other, University.

I have experienced a lot more in my college life relationship, networking , dealing with people, increases my EQ, watched lots of movies and TV shows !

Now the confusions I have

A.

I got placed in a company called Zeus Learning ( Software Engineer role), that mainly focus on web frameworks and related stuff.
I can go there for internships or

1. I can practice and get AWS/Google cloud certifications
2. Practice Competitive Programming
3. Datacamp courses
4. Fast.ai and similar courses
5. Complete some specialization on edX / Coursea.

6. Do bit of everything ( what I always choose)

I know choosing one thing is very important but I can't finalize. I can do this all with the internship or without it.

I want to intern in a good company) startup(ML or Data science role) , but I can't get with my current profile.

 That's confusion no. A, what should I do?

B.

I want to go abroad ( Honestly settle there) for master's. I dream to work in Silicon Valley.  I am planning Canada for easy way of permanent residence. ( And if I have talent then I could get a job there afterwards)

I have heard it is GPA centric. I have 7.85 CPI and 7.61 CGPA ( till semester 6) . Also I do not have any great personal projects(till now to showcase on GitHub) nor any research work. My final year project is on machine learning ( QA system) . Can I get into a decent University with a great SOP or shall I wait to get into a good University. I can get into most colleges in Canada for a post graduate diploma!

What should I do here too!

University plays very important role , actually students play but great students generally go to top Universities. But I suppose I could now thrive there with the wisdom and experience I gained in my undergrad. And then I may do a second master's, a PhD or , executive MBA from a top university .
 

This is a bit of my story feel free to ask anything if you can't connect some dota. And I count on redditers to guide me

I am definitely planning to write a medium post to share my experience and advice for the sophomore undergrads.

I am a computer science student who recently started to look at the knapsack problem in my free time. As it is NP-hard, finding an algorithm in polynomial time and space would mean that P = NP. So I decided to try just that.

I tried algorithms mostly on paper and finally started one in java a few weeks ago. It evolved a lot since then and doesn't actually do anything it did at the start. This is to say that my java code is mostly unoptimized as it wasn't planned in any way, shape or form.

I would try and find flaws in the algorithm by comparing results with a dynamic programming knapsack algorithm. When a result would be different, I would change my algorithm. That is until I got to this iteration of my code. As I do not completely understand why the algorithm works or not, I do not know how to change it (or not change it) without finding a particular instance where it doesn't give the right result. I haven't found a wrong result yet and I don't really know where to go from there. I might be testing bad and easy entries? I don't know. So here I am. I don't have the skills to understand clearly what the algorithm does in order to make it work for sure or not so I thought I would share the main process behind the code as it might be interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here's the main mechanism of the algorithm  :

The idea is to loop through all the items and add them to potential optimal sacks. These potential sacks are stocked in an arrayList that will act as a waterfall for items to be dropped in. For each item in the loop, you look if it fits in the first sack, if it does, you drop it in, if it doesn't, you look if it can replace another item for a better value, if it does or doesn't, you then look to combine it (the item from the loop) with one of the items of the next sack to replace an item of the first sack. If you have found a better value by replacing an item of the sack, you choose the greatest new better value and replace the item with the single item or combined items corresponding (to the greatest new better value). If the loop item didn't fit in the first sack, you try it in the next sack and repeat until you find a spot. In the case it replaced an item in a sack, you have to place this replaced item in a sack below, continuing the loop of the first item.

This will create a container of various sacks. You can then use this container to repeat the mechanism explained in the previous paragraph but this time, without stopping the loop if the item is placed. By doing so, the algorithm will try to place the item in every sack below his own sack. We can do this from top to bottom and from bottom to top. We can do both if we remember the original configuration of the container. It might not be clear so I have made a (quick) pseudocode of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

git repository and pseudocode :

The pseudocode can be found in text.txt in the git repository. What is explained earlier is under Sack (not Container). I should also say the pseudocode only looks at the important methods of the implementation. Also, Sack and Container have functions with the same name.

[https://github.com/bagelLove/Knapsack](https://github.com/bagelLove/Knapsack)

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't calculate the complexity but the number of steps cannot be higher than n\^6 I believe. It loops over the sacks and the items. So of course n items but the number of potential sacks decreases the more they contain items and vice versa. I managed to test entries of 600 items but I haven't finished a single 1000 items entry test. The space usage should be around n\^2 (never higher for sure).

It works well with very high maximal capacity. I couldn't test the dynamic algorithm with W = 1 000 000 000 000 but this one (seems to) works fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Algorithm for Knapsack 0-1 working? in n\^6 (in a probably impossible scenario). and a github repository with code and pseudocode. Thought I would share with you to see if any of it is interesting.

The first problem is getting the exponent right. One way to do this (assuming the number cannot have fractional parts once converted) is to shift the mantissa all the way to the left and then convert it using a normal double dabble algorithm or any other binary to BCD algorithms. The exponent is harder, since I don't know how to do it.

Many people keep telling me one of 2 things: either how to convert the number to a normal BCD (excluding the exponent), or how to convert it using base 2. To better illustrate the later case, I will provide an example. Say we have a number such as -1.01 \* 2 \^ 010, right? What people tell me is to just convert each part of the number (the mantissa, the exponent) to decimal. So that number would become 1.25 \* 2 \^ 2. But that is not what I'm looking for, since it's not true base conversion.

Other thing that people tell me is to divide the exponent with a constant which is around 3.32, obtained by dividing log(10)/log(2), and then just shifting the mantissa like I said. But this yields another problem, what if the number is ""half shifted"". That is, instead of representing 5.321 \* 10 \^ 3 (5321), you have a number like 5.321 \* 10 \^ 2 (532.1). Converting fractions to binary is not very nice, just like binary fractional is not very nice at all.

So, does anyone know a way to accurately convert binary floating point to decimal BCD scientific notation without using division, as approximate as possible and basically doing the opposite of the problems I described in this post? I know it's possible, since a mechanical computer from 1938 - the Z1 - was able to do it very cleanly and it was a very nice conversion.

Unfortunately, the documentation for that machine is absolute garbage (the one available to me anyway). I would appreciate it if anyone helps me. Sorry for writing a text wall but I need to describe this problem with my best words because assuming that other people want to do the same thing as me and can read my mind is not a good guess.",0,1

So I have been going through the Codecademy Computer Science curriculum, and for the most post I am understanding the *concepts* that they are teaching, like while/for looping, functions, arguments, lists. That kind of stuff

But I'm finding myself either looking at hints, or needing to compare my answer to the solution a lot for some of these more recent challenges. For example, there are a challenge where you had to take two lists, and if list1 equaled list2 backwards, return True.

I created my function and my arguments, but then after that, I got lost and needed to look at the solution, to compare and figure out the logic behind the right answer.

I don't know if I am overthinking things or what, because people here say that Codecademy is a good introduction to coding, and if I am getting stuck on a beginner program, maybe I should reconsider changing my major.

I know its crazy considering I have only been programming for about a week, but as someone with Anxiety I can't help but think that this is like a warning.

I'm currently in my 2nd year of an AAS in Computer Information Systems at CityTech in Brooklyn. I'm trying to figure out if I should stay on this track or transfer to a better school and get a BS in Computer Science. Here's some notes:

If I stay at CityTech and get my AAS there, the obvious next step is to get the BTech degree that they offer. However, my biggest worry is that employers in the future will see a BTech degree and get immediately turned off.

Pros: They offer 2 internships (one for the AAS degree, one for the BTech)
The BTech allows me to choose a field to specialize in (Database systems, networking and security, IT Operations, and Software Development)
I already know the school and it shouldn't take me too long to get both degrees.

Cons: CityTech is probably not a very reputable school.
It takes me nearly an hour and 15 minutes to get there via train (and I hate taking the train for so long)
MAIN CON: Future employers may not like the BTech degree and would instead prefer a BS.

So, any advice?

Like you, I am nerd too. I like and love computers and programming. I am using Mac (OS X, now its called macOS), and I thought of other operating systems like Windows OS and Linux. My MacBook Air 2015 (bought used one) is working fine, it does it job, really high quality machine both in hardware and software. I saw reviews of new Mac line computers, lot of problems with keyboard, CPU throttling, heating, etc etc... In pursuit of ultimate thinness they sacrificed some things + I think that keyboard is too thin for my taste. And last thing, I am from Serbia and having Apple laptop and if someone goes wrong can be very expensive. Because of stuff I mentioned I thought of buying some laptop/desktop and installing Linux or Windows. 

I got some feeling about Linux. I am web programmer (PHP, MySQL), swift, python + learning C and C++.

I see lots of posts about what OS should programmers/developers use. So I am asking you as a nice Reddit community,

What **OS** would you recommend to someone:

* **Linux**
* **Windows**
* **OS X aka macOS**

And what are reasons for recommending that to someone, pros and cons.

Of course, if you are aiming for windows/mac develoment you should  get windows/mac computer for that.

Be objective, dont be like:

&gt; Mac stinks, Windows rule! Take that Apple boiz, hehe :3

I am having some trouble understanding how to systematically/algorithmically compute FOLLOW sets, given that I have computed the FIRST sets. 

For the following grammar:

    E -&gt; TE'
    E' -&gt; +TE' | 
    T -&gt; FT'
    T' -&gt; FT' |  
    F -&gt; (E) | id

I found that the FIRST sets are:

    FIRST(E) = { (, id }
    FIRST(E') = { + ,   }
    FIRST(T) = { (, id }
    FIRST(T') = { *,   }
    FIRST(F) = { (, id }

When it comes to computing the FOLLOW sets, I am trying to use the following rules:

    1. $ goes into the set FOLLOW(S) where S is the start symbol.
    2. If A -&gt; aBb, then (FIRST(b) - {  }) is in FOLLOW(B).
    3. If A -&gt; aB then everything in FOLLOW(A) is in FOLLOW(B)
    4. If A -&gt; aBb and  is in FIRST(b), then everything in FOLLOW(A) is in FOLLOW(B).

Obviously, the step I am most certain here is that 

`FOLLOW(E)` contains `$`, based on rule 1. But everything after that, I seem to have a hard time following a pattern on how to systematically compute the FOLLOW sets. For example, to compute `FOLLOW(E)`, how are we supposed to approach this?

`E -&gt; TE'`, looks like `A -&gt; aB` , so everything in `FOLLOW(E)` is in `FOLLOW(E')`. Where to go from here? Do I compute `FOLLOW(E')`? Then going to `FOLLOW(E')`:

`E' -&gt; + TE'`... looks  like `A -&gt; aBb`. Then that means `FIRST(E') - {   }` is in `FOLLOW(T)`. So I do know that `{ + }` is in `FOLLOW(T)`. 

As you can see, with the way I have interpreted this, I am going around all over the place computing the FOLLOW of another production. Ultimately, I end up losing track on what terminal symbols go into which follow set. :( 

I am for sure misunderstanding something here.

What is the right approach/ordering to compute the FOLLOW sets?",0,1

Ive been doing coding since undergrad and I finally made the decision to pursue a masters in computer science because my employer can cover some of the tuition (almost 6k per year, I am willing to pay some from my pocket if required ofcourse).

I have a few questions:

Do I have to have done an undergrad in comp. science to be ""comfortable"" during my masters or will I feel a huge knowledge gap compared to others who have studied comp. science in their undergrad?

Ive used alot of python, C++, matlab, fortan and excel VBA during my undergrad, masters and work. I think I know most of the basics of coding such as object oriented etc. I am also learning C# now and how to create a plug-in for some of the software we use in the company. I am confident that I am a very fast learner. My undergrad GPA was 4/4 from an ABET accredited university abroad and Ive completed my masters in canada and did very well (95/100 average and 2 journal, 4 conference papers published).

I already looked into some programs local to New York City and most of them just require me to take two undergrad courses to get admitted to the program.

If I take these two undergrad courses, will I be fine? I will be taking my masters part time during evening classes. I am just afraid ill feel so behind and will have to put immense effort just to feel I am equal to others with a comp. science undergrad.

Anyone with experience please share. Also if anyone can recommend good programs in NYC (that are affordable and reputable) that would be helpful. Thank you!!

Edit: Im currently not thinking about switching careers, but Id like to take advantage of the reimbursement by my employer and MAYBE have a degree incase I want to go into fields that require both engineering and comp science backgrounds. I am 25 yo if that matters.",3,1

Im not looking for a new project of my own right now either. Im  sure its just a temporary adjustment issue and Im rather knew to this.  I feel so sad, Ive cried it out too, but I dont know why Im crying.  (Im a girl, before people start calling me a sissy).  Its almost though as I miss school, my professors too, but I dont at the same time because the course load was draining.  I hated it at first, and at many times and then I slowly grew to love it, especially machine architecture.  I was stressed to oblivion but pretty happy week by week by the second half of the semester, once I became numb and accustomed to the pace of things.   Maybe its cause I was so selfless this semester and absorbed into my work - school was all I knew and now I forgot what life is like before that.  Im not here looking for sympathy or trying to be depressing. Im just confused with these feelings and wondering if anyone can relate to this.  Im asking because its my fourth semester in college and Ive never felt like this before.

I'm confused on how to figure out title lines for functions. The sheet I have doesn't tell me what a function does so I have nothing to really base off. Does anyone here know C++ well enough to explain this to me? It's weird cause the practice sheets I do say what the function does but my actual tests don't. How do I determine what the function does even though nothing is explained to me. Sorry for being so dumb. How can I effectively do this? It seems difficult to usually look at a title line like: double k(int x, double b) and just know that it's adding two numbers together or something.

&amp;#x200B;

int main () {

int x = 0, y = 1, z = 2; 

double w\[3\] = {1.9, 2.3, 3.0};

x = a(x + y, z);                                line a

w\[0\] = b(x, y, y, w\[2\]);                  line b

&gt; different names may refer to the same function, but that function itself has only one intrinsic name.

I'm just not sure I understand the rationale behind this. I understand the desire for functions to have some sort of (usually) static value, but this is one thing I never understood even looking at ASM code generated by compilers...

Why not store all functions in a single global lookup table rather than pollute the global space with a bunch of intrinsic names?

This might have several benefits:

1) Still compatible with the idea that objects are unique by memory address if you're programming at a ""lower level"" (Ex: C, C++, ASM). The lookup table could map a name to a memory address.

2) Behaviors could be swapped out. Let's say you want to take an existing program and modify an intrinsic function to be something else. I'm not sure how you would even do this in the ASM of statically compiled programs, to be honest, but it seems like it would be trivial to swap memory references of a global function lookup table.

This is probably less useful to most program authors vs someone who wants to modify behaviors of existing programs.

3) Such a lookup table could be cloned and modified in nested or alternate execution environments. So you'd still have global scope and local scopes in runtimes, but you could maybe build behavioral plugin systems by taking advantage of this data structure at runtime. It's the difference between there being a single static list vs a malleable thing. I mean, most language runtimes already have local scope so I'm not sure how useful this would be, but I'm thinking more at the system / ASM level that this might introduce some meta-programming capabilities.

So why not do this?

I have no where near the expertise to reason about this.

One reason I can think of is perhaps performance? Fully statically compiled code can probably cache references to where functions are in memory so they don't actually have to be looked up by name. With how many function calls are made by programs, you'd either see slowdowns or want to deal with the caching problem here in order to keep performance.

Anyways sorry if this is a dumb or obvious question but it'd be cool to understand this better :) ",7,1

The whole class is based of C. We started from the very basics of if and else to pointers and structures(it was brief). I want to clarify a couple of things so you guys can give me a better answer. 
I had a terrible teacher. You might say, ooh well you were just lazy, or who are you to define a terrible teacher? Well Im defining a terrible teacher by these standards; Im sure most of you are aware of cs50s online course. It is the most engaging, insightful course (probably) online and in (probably) most schools? I know Im setting the bar high for this teacher (she graduated from UCSB) 
Trust me,  I set the bar high for most people, and for myself. I see good quality when I see it, and I know sh*t quality when I see if, and Im just as guilty for that. This teacher, though, had everyone good up until pass by reference and pass by value. After that everyone went downhill, mostly because before that we could figure things out on our own. After that our labs got harder and we didnt have much context for our labs. She went over pointers for about 30 minutes and then showed us a bunch of YouTube videos (they were good videos, but why are we paying a teacher to show us YouTube videos?) The instructor in Cs50s course would go in-depth to what REALLY was going on and that was really insightful! It made you think of other things and made things exciting! (Maybe cs isnt that exciting?) 
So now that the course is over, I received a C ( somehow? She made our final really easy as she wanted everyone to pass. Even then, some people still found it hard.) On a brighter note, as I have been going through my maths and  little side readings on physics, maths, and some computer stuff, I realized that Im much more excited about math and physics than cs? I think they go really in depth to the fundamentals of everything and I just think thats rad. but computer science has artificial intelligence? So should I give another semester of CS (the next course is java)? Maybe it was the teacher or the language that made me lose interest? ",15,1

Write a program called diamond.c that takes a command line input of a string and builds a diamond from the characters in the string. The top of the diamond should be the first letter of the string repeated twice. The next line is comprised of the next char in the string and should be two more than the previous line. This continues until halfway through the string at which point each line should get shorter until the end. The final character should also be printed two times.

The diamond should be symmetrical top and bottom.  This is achieved by repeating the two middle lines when necessary.

I guess the question i'm asking is if I spent 8+ hours every day going from a fairly low level of programming to a presumably high level-- would 3ish months be enough to land a basic programming job? Or is school really the only way to get there?

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

&amp;#x200B;

1- I don't plan on dropping out of school or skipping it. I recognize that in the long term school is the best solution. But I currently live with family and have some time to focus on Work/Programming, and for financial reasons school isn't 100% possible atm. So since i've already got an off semester, I thought this might be a worthy way of spending it.

&amp;#x200B;

2- I don't expect it to carry me all the way. I'm mostly looking for an in to the industry and a way out of working at Best-Buy making very basic pay with basic benefits. Something more 'livable' if you may.

&amp;#x200B;

Second Question: If you do think it's a reasonable idea to drop games/recreation, standard studies and many social activities for a period of time to get a jump into the programming world-- what do you think my focus should be on?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript and possibly some C++ or Swift. (Maybe Flutter or Kotlin?). I'd also need to learn a bit of Lisp/Scheme. (Mainly for exploring algorithms).

But i'm also worried about learning more about the CS basics. Should I focus more on the straight coding, or more on learning about networks and other parts of the industry? I'm afraid I won't be prepared for some of the other details.

Of course another big thing will be learning the algorithms. I've got a subscription to [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/) which covers a lot of algorithms and computer science fundamentals, a subscription to [https://www.algoexpert.io/questions](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions) which covers 65 major interview questions (basically efficiency/sorting/algorithm practice) and SICP. (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Looking at most of the job descriptions they all ask for BA or MA's. But I always through programming was different. Is it just to scare away unqualified employees? Or will they actually cut someone if they don't have the degree, even if their understanding of the code/past projects shows they know their stuff?",8,1

317,2018-12-17,2018,12,17,0,a6pxk2,How to prepare for ServiceNow CSA Certification,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/a6pxk2/how_to_prepare_for_servicenow_csa_certification/,AuranxCommunication,1544974889,"ServiceNow CSA Certification, fully named Certified System Administration, is the entry point to the ServiceNow learning universe. In most cases, this certification is preceded by a CSA training, which makes it easier to pass the exam, since all the information are still fresh in your head, and you just came out of a several hours course, dedicated just for that goal.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue might be more relevant for people who didnt pass the training or didnt get the chance to pass the certification directly after that. Things can get a little complicated in that case because:

&amp;#x200B;

Case 1: Since the training have ended, if you had any, youve been working on some precise ServiceNow module, and forgot about all the other tiny details;

Case 2: And its worse, youve completely drifted away from the ServiceNow technology, and now its all foggy to you.

Ive been there, I lived that!

I had a quick training when I was an intern but didnt get the chance to pass the exam. After three years working as a full-time ServiceNow consultant, I decided to pass the ServiceNow CSA Certification. I can assure you, I wasnt really sure from where to start, but I managed to prepare myself, and by the last day, I was more than ready to pass it, and I got it with no sweat.

&amp;#x200B;

Allow me to share the 5 tips that will grant you the green PASS you all want to get.

&amp;#x200B;

1- Know what to expect

The ServiceNow CSA Certification is multiple choice exam. It has 60 questions and youll need to get a score of 70% or higher to pass. Some questions accept many correct answers, so youll have to check them all because an incomplete answer is considered as a wrong one. Youll have 90 minutes to complete the exam, if you handle it right, it will be more than enough.

&amp;#x200B;

2- Find a preparation partner

Thats an important point if theres another colleague, friend, an acquaintance who is willing to pass the ServiceNow CSA Certification, partner up!

&amp;#x200B;

I found it really helpful to have a preparation partner, it allows you to cover more ground. While sharing a cup of coffee or on your way to work, just start talking about the subject and challenging your partners knowledge. Youll be amazed by the amount of new information you can learn that way. Youll ask a question, thinking that you already know the answer, the partner will reply with a different idea, uncovering a whole new interpretation that you were neglecting.

&amp;#x200B;

3- Read the ServiceNow FundamentalsParticipant Guide

&amp;#x200B;

Its the official guide used by ServiceNow as training support, it has been given to you if you already passed it. If not, try to ask all your acquaintances for it, even if its an old ServiceNow release, just read it. There are only some tiny changes in the core modules, and on the CSA exam questions, they wont be asking you a lot, if not any, about a new releases abilities. The major questions are about common modules and some basic notions that have been there in the last four or five releases.

&amp;#x200B;

The participant guide is not free, and cannot be bought separately.

&amp;#x200B;

This document is a must-read before the exam, your preparation will be very much easier if you have it.

&amp;#x200B;

4- Dont rush it

ServiceNow is a tricky technology, its learning curve is really fast in the beginning, but becomes slower as time goes, and as you gain more experience. And thats the trick, sometimes we underestimate the platform, and we think that, because we passed the last three weeks working on it, and have seen the biggest part of its fundamentals, we think that we are ready to pass the ServiceNow CSA Certification, and thats not the case. Thats a big mistake that unfortunately a lot of people make.

&amp;#x200B;

Take your time, try to go in-depth about the ServiceNow platform, become familiar with the core table names, get ahold of the workflow mechanism and how its working, know your way around the Access Control Lists (ACL) and understand the behavior of the Now Platform. Then, and only then, think about passing the CSA Certification.

&amp;#x200B;

5- Review Flashcards and take a Practice Exam

Flashcards are very helpful when preparing for the ServiceNow CSA Certification. Its a quick way to refresh your memory and makes you answer questions you were not thinking of. Try not to just answer and pass to the next card, but think about every information you reveal, especially if you missed it. Search on the official documentation and the community until you fully comprehend the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Practice exams will prepare your time management and make you measure how prepared you really are.

&amp;#x200B;

Ill share two links. First one for the flashcards, and the second for a Practice Exam. But as a disclaimer, some of the questions and the flashcards are outdated and incorrect. Also, the given links are not verified by ServiceNow, so dont consider everything you read as sacred axioms, and feel free to challenge every bit of information that doesnt seem correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

I hope that the shared tips help you build a preparation plan and ease your anxiety about the exam.

&amp;#x200B;

Prepare yourself and know the material before heading there, and youll find that it was easier than what you thought. Dont stress it out, take your time and keep learning until you start feeling confident that you can win it.

I thought I'd make use of the opportunity to set it up properly before I go ahead and install a whole bunch of stuff on it. What are your tips on setting up and managing a new computer? For example:

* How do you manage development environments? For python, I used to just install everything in the base environment before learning about virtual environments, for which I used conda to manage though I know venv exists as well. Would conda be the best way to continue managing virtual environments? Do such things exist for other languages like nodejs or java?
* Likewise, how do you manage packages? Whenever I needed something, I just googled the package and installed using whatever command line command they listed there, typically npm. I also know nvm exists but is complicated, and a bunch of other package managers like yarn or conda. Is there a ""best"" way to download and manage various packages?
* This is a little more specific, but I will be doing work with tensorflow and pytorch and previously had a lot of trouble getting them to work with my gpu. Is there an easier way of reinstalling the necessary nvidia and cuda drivers or do I just have to do it step by step manually?
* Whats the best way to have version control? I previously used command line git with github and will probably continue to, but just wanted to check if anyone else had tips on version control.
* Multiple IDEs or just one? I used to use spyder for python, eclipse for java and atom/sublime text for everything else but am looking to see if there are any IDEs you recommend for everything in one?
* Any other tips on things to do with a new computer?

I know the questions are rather broad, but hope I can get some tips from everyone!

Today, I have a Core i5, 4 Gb of RAM, an 256 Gb SSD and a 1 Tb HDD.  Honestly, I'm hardly doing something different from what I did back in 1999. I can tell I have the same programs installed (never versions, of course) but they pretty much do the same.

However, those 8Mb of RAM and 1 Gb of HDD wouldnt even be enough to store the installer of the OS.

Sometimes, I feel like there is some sort of vicious circle (or conspiracy) making software more demanding so Hardware people can sell newer computers, thus allowing software to become more demanding next generation.

355,2018-12-18,2018,12,18,12,a7762o,How a Programmer's Commenting Strategies is a Complete Misconception of Writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/a7762o/how_a_programmers_commenting_strategies_is_a/,SweetNaterTater,1545103205,"# Before I get this started I want to make something clear. The reason I'am posting this is for a college writing class, so please do not judge my work to much. Otherwise any feedback regarding this paper is absolutely fine.

Writing is looked upon in many different and unique ways. We usually use some kind of form of writing everyday, and that includes posting something on Reddit. However, that is not what I am here to talk about today. There are all kinds of writing that can be looked at as misconceptions of writing like texting, reminders on a calendar, and etc. I want to talk about why the comments in a programmer's code is huge misconception of actually writing.  Writing programs is a very fun thing to do, but it can get really challenging if you do not remember what a specific function, or line of code is suppose to execute. We as programmers will input these comments into our code, so we can recall the information on screen. That is not the only reason comments are used in code. Like writing in general, we do not just use writing to remember what we are suppose to get at the grocery store. It is used in many different varieties, and we can not even count on two hands the amount of styles of writing. Why that is you may ask? The main reason I can give is that everyone has their own style of writing. That style does not matter what, but we all do have our own and different writing style that makes it difficult for other people to make sense of whatever we are currently writing. The same thing goes for programmers. There are many times where programmers can not make sense of other programmer's code because of the way that programmer comments. Those comments will only make sense to the original programmer who wrote that code. Now if we disregard all of that, there are two main styles of writing that we look back on to identify what are writing represents. In order to identify what writing that is we must figure out why comments are used to help people learn or remember, and what are the differences between formal and informal writing in a programmer's comments.

In a formal writing style there will be a lot more complex sentences used in explaining what the code means. Most of these formal comments will appear at the beginning of programs, and will give a brief explanation on what the program or main function will execute. The reason for these formal comments can be compared to the fact of why we would leave comments to remember something.  If we want to try and recall something about a certain line of code. The programmer will write a more detailed comment explaining what the code is going to do. This is very important, because the programmer can explain what the code can represent in a complete sentence.  This leads to being able to teach people, and that can lead to much more important things. A better understanding can be obtained about what the code is executing, because of these formal comments. These formal comments can relate to writing formal papers for school, or a job opportunity. You have to develop complex ideas, and use really strong language to describe specific details. Being able to write in a formal manner is really important. It can increase our knowledge of communication with others.

Writing to communicate to someone is very important, but it does not mean we have to communicate in a formal way all the time. Being able to identify, or write in an informal way is just as useful. When a programmer begins to write code, they usually include comments. Most programmers usually write their comments in a more informal way. What I mean by that is that these comments are written like you take notes during a class lecture. You would abbreviate anything that is long or complex, so it can be more simple for the programmer to make sense for. Part of making comments shorter by abbreviating makes programming more efficient. I think we can all agree that in engineering in general efficiency is the most important thing of all. It is about completing something fast, and as small as possible. For example, look at how technology started out as giant machinery. As time as gone by, technology has improved, but it has advanced quicker than expected and has shrunk down to something so small that can fit in your hand.

Technology is unbelievable where it has taken off from the past, but there are still small little things within the device's actually code that can be improved upon about by a programmer. Some devices have problems with being operated, because when another group of engineers that come to work on this device they struggle to understand the comments. The reason they struggle to understand these comments is that they are summarized up, or written in a informal way where only the original programmer who wrote the code can make sense of what ever the program is suppose to execute. That is why another way programmers write code is, so that anyone who looks at it (does not matter if it is an engineer or a regular person) can make sense of the information given to them. Leaving comments like this can be considered a way of formal writing, but truly there is nothing stating the comments have to be formal or informal. The most important thing about these comments is that the comments teach the person something about whatever lines of code the comments correspond to. Being able to teach someone about what the code means just by describing the code in the comments, can be an essential tool to helping future kids who have an interest in computer science, or anything to do with programming now have more access to knowledge that they never had before.

To conclude this long message to the world about programmer's comments, I just want to address that these comments are overall more important then the actually code itself. Without any comments in the code we would not have any idea what the code is suppose to execute when it is ran. It would make learning the knowledge about what certain lines of code, or what kinds of programs execute when ran, and why you would need to use these programs for yourself. These comments within the code is like writing a informal response to someone on social media. The hold feedback that can give off great information regarding what the code means. These comments can be written in an informal way where they are abbreviated, or summarized to a point that you take a quick glance and you have an understanding of the content. This usually has something to do with looking at billboards when you are driving down a road. The billboards are huge, but they are small messages that get the main point across of whatever message the person is trying to address. For example if I was writing a program that would page from one page to next just by pressing a button I would create an if/elseif/else statement that would make this possible, because you can choose from multiple different options. I would write the informal comment like this, If pg=1(That is the value. This is not included in comment, but for understanding purposes of blog)next pg. This is looked at differently when we begin to talk about formal written comments, because they are usually used in a manner to remind the programmer what the code means or to teach someone something about what the code is suppose to execute. If I write an if statement that is going to compare an integer to a specific value, and the integer matches the integer or that so value. It will run a line of code that makes something happen. I would write the formal comment like this, ""If the integer is equal to value(lets say the value is 0) then the code will run the code below this."" These examples give off a better understanding of what the code represents, and you can actually retain some knowledge about programming no matter what your experience is with programming at all. That is why a programmer's comments is a writing misconception.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introducing**

&amp;#x200B;

At beginning we have very big oriented network graph for example like this: [https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/stories/images/network-nodes.png](https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/stories/images/network-nodes.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The first task is select some node and divide from all this network. (This part already done) 

&amp;#x200B;

After that we got something like tree-like graph where the selected node is center with inputs and outputs. There are some rule for this new graph. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example: if we select node A from network, with B, C as children and D as parent. So in this new sub-graph we draw only children of B, C (but not  parent) and only parents of D (but not child). 

&amp;#x200B;

Like parent-&gt;parent-&gt;selected (center node)-&gt;children-&gt;children.  So the next and for now the hardest is visualize graph. By visualize I mean set static X, Y in screen with selected node at center, parents at left part of screen and children at right part of screen. ([https://imgur.com/a/PEN8LDN](https://imgur.com/a/PEN8LDN))

&amp;#x200B;

**Current progress**

&amp;#x200B;

Now I use vis.js ([http://visjs.org/](http://visjs.org/)) library for visualization this sub-graph. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#1** By simple moving from center to right and after to left with some static spaces. but there are some cases when one node overlay other ( [https://imgur.com/a/GhdvIlS](https://imgur.com/a/GhdvIlS)) 

&amp;#x200B;

**#2**  Set nodes by horizontal lines, but there is cases when it's look ugly ([https://imgur.com/a/WxUIvxG](https://imgur.com/a/WxUIvxG))  (expected something like this  [https://imgur.com/a/ffsrQSs](https://imgur.com/a/ffsrQSs))

Quick backstory:

Two of my assigned teammates for this projects are devoted windows users. One of them is a maths student who recently signed up for cs, the other one is in my semester. It's the latter one that is giving me a headache.

He supposedly works for a software company, which is solely using Windows to develop for a Linux based system. I don't know what is going on there, but alright.
He is very stubborn, we already had a few arguments because of that.

The actual problem:

Our application is supposed to be a front-end to communicate with a backend developed on our uni. And it is of course only build/distributed for Linux. Also our app is built in Vue.js and I do not know how good yarn/npm are supported under Windows, if at all. I don't think it will be possible for us (especially him) to write this app without running the backend locally to try out a lot.

We already had a few problems with Windows , random encoding changes to files after he opened them, his system not being able to recognise softlinks (which sadly are needed to keep the repo halfway clean with the conditions our prof put us up with), me writing scripts his system doesn't understand and so forth; and I do not believe that there will be less in the future.

Have any of you experienced something like this?

I would like to convince him to use Linux, but I do not know how to approach this.

If I can't do that, I would be willing to let him be, but he still won't be able to livetest the app without the running backend, not to mention mom / yarn.",19,1

My goal is to, at some point, work from home because of health issues (I can work in an office and do now, it would just be easier from home with less chance of having to take time off work for some reason). As much as I would love to get into embedded systems, I know that's unlikely. So, I'll be looking at getting more into desktop applications or, I realize, some web development even though that's not my ideal. But I can live with it.

For those that don't want to click the links (don't blame you), the SD program uses C++ and includes classes on data structures, algorithms, OS architecture, as well as a couple business classes (financial accounting and project management) and some web dev stuff. Also includes Calc I and Discrete (I'll pass it one day, damn it!). 

The CS uses Java (they used to use C++ but changed), and then the typical CS fare. The math goes Calc I, II, Discrete, Linear Algebra, and Probability/Stas. The math makes me nervous. I know I can get through it, but it makes me nervous. If I thought I could do embedded systems, I'd be all over the CS. Another concern is I haven't compared, but at first glance, I think the CS will take slightly longer.

I'm not necessarily asking someone to tell me which degree to do (though I'm not opposed to opinions). I am asking how to make the right decision. I prefer C++ over Java, but I'll live (I've taken classes in C, C++, and Java years ago...C was my favorite). I know a lot of times CS! is the standard answer, but I want to make sure that it makes sense for what I want to do (and/or will end up doing since my choices will be limited due to wanting to be remote) and is worth the time and potential math difficulties. So, I'm looking for good criteria and ways to decide if anyone has insight. Thanks!",5,1

We are confused about something. Our Computer Organization Class' teacher gave us an assignment. He wants us to give a lecture about ""Computer Architecture in Practice"" in the class. 

The thing is, if we talk about Computer Architecture's practices, isn't that mean we are talking about Computer Organization ? As far as I understand, practices of Computer Architecture are the products that are built by using Computer Organization. 

If so why is he said ""Computer Architecture in Practice"" instead of saying directly ""Computer Organization"" ?

On paper, it sounded great for someone like me. I come from a business orientated background, have little to no code experience up to this point, but wanted to make the career change (I'm 23, but I didn't realize CompSci was what I wanted until I finished my undergrad) early and attain my Master's early.

So again, Northeastern's program felt like a fit. However, it was blatant false advertisement and the in-person component was not conductive to my work schedule. The professors were inexperience - and admitted it, the administration said because their program is new that they aren't sure how to go about it. I'm not okay with this and my grades suffered as a result.

I anticipated a graduate program to cater to the working professional. This was advertised. Yet, in my meeting with the university last week, I was told that was their mistake and you can't work full-time and get a master's in this program. I find this baffling - I know plenty of full time workers who do their graduate studies online and do it well. I felt the in-person commitment in the long run to really work against me and my work schedule.

Anyway, I want to be involved in Computer Science. I don't have the background. But, I'm passionate about data, creating visualizations, and data science as a whole. But, I'm going in with a business undergrad acumen. I know I can transition well, but I don't know what programs would work for someone like me, where to go, I have no guidance and just am reaching out to see if anyone knows any programs that may be a fit. 

I plan on quitting Northeastern and getting my money back. But, I don't want to be floating without direction. I want to be admitted in a program before leaving.

TL;DR I am trying to find an online-only Master's program in Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, Data Science, etc. that would allow me to thrive and learn without vast prior experience. ",7,1

After that i will transfer over to another school to get a bachelors.

My question to you guys is what can I do to get the most out of it and ensure I have a career at the end of the 4 years? 

Ive been seeing that I should be applying for internships during summer breaks. Most of those internships also state that you should know how to use java and c++? Does this I would have to learn those on my own before I apply? Or will I learn that in school.

Do I also use udemy courses to lean more quickly? Where can I practice my code and create a portfolio. 

Are there events and meet ups for computer science students? 

Any advice would help. What would you have done differently now that some of you guys have graduated?

I went to RWTH Aachen University this year and so far I learn during the week every day till at least 10 pm. Naturally, I then have no time for friends, hobbies but also for volunteering or own projects I could put on my github.

A friend of mine is on a different University studying the same subject and has a lot more free time.

 I worry the next few years won't be good for my health but also a degree alone wouldn't look really good on my CV.
I will try to work a bit less and maybe take a year longer for my degree, so maybe I will have a bit more freetime then. But still, on a different University I maybe would have a lot more time for self-development, relationships, volunteering, sports. Then again my university is actually researching interesting things and I could participate in a lot of different research fields. My university offers many interesting lectures and exhibitions.

Has someone been in a similar situation or has some advice for me?",10,1

Longtime lurker in their late 20s here.  For the last year or so I've been considering going back to school for a second bachelor's degree in computer science.  I currently work as a GIS analyst for the federal government.  I was originally pre-med in undergrad then switched into the social sciences after I started interning in government as a sophomore.

The other analysts at my agency with comp sci backgrounds clearly are able to perform at a higher level and advance faster than me.  I'm fascinated by computers and have taken classes in Python to try to script routines at work.  My boss suggested looking into part-time masters programs in data science/analytics that my agency might consider paying for instead of a second bachelors, which would require me to quit and take out student loans.  Short to mid-term it would make more sense financially to do a masters.   There are a lot of foundational comp sci concepts though I don't understand, and my sense is that a masters in data science will only offer limited proficiency in programming.  Also, long-term I feel like a bachelors will open more doors to transfer into private sector industries and advanced degree programs that are more lucrative??  Money isn't my main concern;  I just want to do cool things that stimulate me and allow me to repay debt and find some way to retire above the poverty line lol.  What makes more sense to you all?

Im getting really down about how the internship search is going for a software engineering position. I have a near-4.0 GPA as a comp sci major in my junior year now. I applied to many companies and have gotten rejected from all the big names, which considering how hard Ive worked in school id really want to work for one of these companies. I have never even had an in person interview yet because I never make it past the online assessment. I own cracking the coding interview and have done some problems and leetcode as well but its really hard for me to work under a rigid clock that if I dont submit something working 100% before the clock runs out, Im given a robotic rejection email. Has anyone gone through/overcame this experience or similar? Any advice on how to exactly prepare for those questions? I hope my investment in college is going to a good cause. Thanks!",13,1

Also, I need some conditions between some sub-subjects (I have to finish that one before to start the other one in a different tree).  The french programming school, ecole 42 is using that progression tree but I don't know how can I implement it with my own requirements.

PS: both pictures are examples, the one I have done on my Ipad is false but it's just to give you an idea! Thank you =)

I'm fairly experienced with application building, but I know comparatively little about networking. Apologies if my question lacks specifics, but that's part of my problem. I guess my query has multiple parts: 

  \- I have something like the average working web developer's knowledge of http/https. What other kind of networking code (e.g. file transfer with UDP) might I find myself writing, and what would be the use cases?

  \- I understand that there is a lot of theory for me to familiarize myself with, with regard to the OSI and TCP/IP models. What I'm not sure how to get is *practical* experience solving problems with this stuff. Like a practical trial that I can undergo within like a day. Tutorials abound for things like ""Deploy an microservice with AWS Fargate"" or ""Write a chat app with web sockets"" or ""Render a cool image with a GL shader"", but for what I'm looking to do now I'm not sure what to ask the internet or if any such compact exercises are available. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I'm Asking**

I'm applying for a job, and I'm pretty far along, but they're being frank with me that I don't know some of what I would be heavily using on the job. They've described some of this as ""comfort writing networking code beyond http"" and actually something like solving problems with machines talking to each other on a local network with ""like, weird protocols."" I'm really interested in the job, and I think what they want is to see a good faith effort on my part to prep for the final interview as well as evidence that I can skill up quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**More Context**

I'm mainly a Python data engineer and JavaScript web developer. I have a research background in NLP &amp; machine learning, but in the years since I've been building mostly web applications and data pipelines using frameworks like Celery, Flask, React, etc. I have some infrastructure-type experience with AWS, Docker, Linux administration, and the like.

I will be starting as a pizza delivery driver soon. The pay will hardly be enough to cover my living expenses. However, I know it will be enough to purchase the $50 a month Coursea cost. My long winded, vague-ass question is how many and particularly which courses certifications should I pursue to obtain a job in a few years time? Which Coursea courses will land me a job in a year or two, and make me a highly marketable candidate? Your advice is appreciated. Please, if you have input let me know. I am desperate for money and struggling. I need upward mobility. Please help me.",6,1

As I said before, I don't know much about the class itself, but from what I've heard, I'm going to safely conclude that it's basically just an extra math class but with computers instead of calculators. If that's the case, I'm willing to review the required material before I take this class next year so I can be prepared. 

BUT, what is AP Computer Science, and is it worth it in general? Will it impress colleges? For those who took the same class in high school, what was your experience? How difficult is it for someone who is ""average"" in math? Is the class easy or hard and why? What is the workload like? Tests?

Also if it is something great, could someone pls provide reference links for me to use or something?

Also, I forgot to mention but I am interested in making games and creating software that helps with engineering analysis (eg. FEA Analysis), although I haven't been directly involved with any of these experiences before (but I would love to). Are there any age restrictions for programming or for someone to qualify as a programmer as such and if so what is your threshold? I am worried that due to my mature age, I might be prevented from working as a programmer after I graduate (I will be almost 30 by the time I graduate). 

Any programmers in Japan? Could you let me know what fields of programming Japanese are mostly interested in and if there are any opportunities for Gaijin? I met this programmer at a recent Japanese language test center (for which I have been studying as a hobby for the last five years) and he seemed interested in moving to the country with his girl friend (nihonjin) after his success with the game he and his studio team had been working on. It's apparently a game with a shark and emphasis on underwater experiences. It seemed much like Subnautica but with a darker twist on it. I haven't played the game personally, only watched Let's play videos on YouTube by a famous Youtuber but it was interesting. 

I have no idea regarding details of what computer science as a field entails. It has only recently come to my attention as I realised that many internships in college and jobs require knowledge of programming and this is actually an employable skillset to have, which is one of the reasons I am considering. (Another reason is that I personally feel interested in learning more about algorithms such as Artifical Intelligence). A potential drawback I see to studying this field is that I won't be able to pursue another opportunity while I study the degree and there will be countervailing costs to it in the end that offset amounts of time and money I spend on studying it. 

Hence, I would be interested to know what kinds of job opportunities are out there for people who study in this area and their experiences in undergrad and workforce. ",11,1

Today I received an email stating that I just got accepted to a 12-week long IOS Mobile Development Bootcamp that will begin in February. The Bootcamp itself is free as the company receives sponsors from other tech companies, so there will be no financial cost to me at all for attending this bootcamp. I'm not denying the practical experience that I'll obtain from the bootcamp, but I was wondering if my time could be better allocated elsewhere (like preparing for job interviews/applying for jobs). 

To give some background on my position, on top of completing my final 12 units that I need in order to graduate, this bootcamp will likely eat away the majority of the free time that I'll have left during the spring semester, and at the moment I do not have a job lined up for me after I graduate. During my current  winter break I've been allocating my daily free time towards applying to other places, organizing meetings for the school club that I'm running, and completing a few personal projects. I've also been working as a Software Engineering intern for a small startup, that will **not** likely lead to a full-time position. I also have limited experiences in mobile development as most of my personal projects and practical experiences are focused on the full-stack development of web-based software applications. I did make a few small apps, and I had a blast workin on those projects, so I wouldn't mind progressing my skills in mobile development. I just wouldn't know how applicable swift would be in the job market, along with mobile-development in general. I am taking a mobile development course as one of my final required courses at my university, where the emphasis would be on cross-platform apps, through c#, so this experience may make me more well-rounded?

  I'm at a position where I feel that I need to just focus on applying and preparing for interviews, and highlight the experiences that I had already completed. At the same time, this bootcamp may expose me to networking opportunities, amazing lectures, and cool projects that I can add onto my resume. Should I take the opportunity considering its free, or should I focus on job hunting until I land a position?

I frequent this sub as many do to observe interactions relating to many newcomers and veterans of the CS field. For the most part all interactions are pleasant, but there are choice cases where better than thou problem solvers muddy the waters. Firstly, I would like to mention that CS is more than computer programming. Programming is just a tool to solve problems that computer scientist encounter. There is this misconception that you have to be special to learn how to program. Your IQ has to be at this level, your brain has to be this size, and you must algorithmically approach washing your dirty underwear every day to sustain the prestige of a computer programmer. Thats where BS meets CS. Hogwash. Anyone can learn to program if they put in the time and effort. Secondly, complexity != intelligence. I have been on a Terry Davis kick lately.. ya know the crazy but clever guy who built his own 2mb Biblical OS. He said something that resonated with me and I 100% buy in to. Geniuses admire simplicity, idiots admire adding complexity. Often when I am programming I try to develop in a way that requires less code and makes the most sense. My philosophy is that someone who knows nothing about programming should be able to read my code and gain basic context as to what is going on. All to often on various forums I see people providing simple and efficient-solutions only to get bullied by unnecessary complexity. Anyway, I am extremely green myself in computer science. I have only been on this journey for 2 years or so, but I have learned a lot about myself and computers during this ride.
