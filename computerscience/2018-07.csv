I'm a first year student and I have only completed one unit of python. 

This unit covered the basics such as:

\- Integers, floats, boolean, strings

\- basic data structures (list, graphs, trees, sets, tables) function

\- brute force and greedy algorithms

The assignment that we had to do was to build a scrabble game where we were given tiles with letters, a function that shuffled tiles, provided scores of individual tiles, and a board on which we could place the tiles. We were tasked with ensuring that the user of our built program made valid words that could be found in a provided dictionary.txt file, did not use words that were not available in given tiles, and we had to find the highest score word for each move. I found this extremely difficult and just managed to get working code. 

Based on this information, could you guys please suggest something that is a similar level to this? Cheers!",1,8

Despite not pursuing a degree, I am seeking to learn this topic on a professional level but is not able to due to over simplification. In addition, since I am sort of lost in the dark about what specific topics to learn and am looking for recommendations (such as a checklist) for a chronological path to acquire knowledge without visiting different sources to learn almost the exact same thing as the previous source.

I'm returning back to college at 25 for a career change, as what I initially went to college for (law enforcement), isn't working out for me. 

I've been a gamer pretty much my whole life, and have always had a fascination with computers. I know a little bit about the technical stuff of computers, but not a whole lot.

I'd like to maybe get like a jump start on the stuff before I do begin, and was kinda wondering if anybody had any suggestions on what websites I can do that on? I know some websites do offer like free 7 day trials for classes (like treehouse, which I'm using now), but I'll stop it before I have to pay for it.

Also, I kinda suck at math! (Can do all the basics, and basic algebra). But once there super long equations and stuff start popping up, that's when I get lost. Will that be a big issue?

I tried talking to my fiances father about this but he got way too into it and ended up not even letting me talk and just went on a rant about how successful he is and it really wasn't helpful because it seemed like he was trying to persuade me to pursue a different degree than the one I currently am (Electrical Engineering &amp; Comp Sci). I am having trouble finding something that is interesting to me and also broad enough to where I can take that information I learned and use it in many different industries, so I have more options post boot camp and degree. 

I understand if I am already on this academic route, what's the point? Although, if the government is willing to drop $20,000-$60,000 on free education I am not gonna pass on that and don't mind putting my degree on hold while I complete this immersive coding boot camp. I am somewhat interested in Cyber Security, I originally joined the Army to be a Cryptologic Network Warfare Specialist but later decided against it because I was an idiot and decided to be a Medic. 

Anywho, I don't entirely know what is what. I have tried to google and find out the difference between the different fields but I just don't want to design websites. Although I have dabbled in learning HTML5, SCSS, CSS, and all of that, I personally found it boring and I didn't enjoy it. I respect all the different fields but I just want to make something MORE. 

I really enjoy the idea of electrical engineering and in the end I will likely focus on that more than CS but I like to keep my options open and have the ability to have a diverse knowledge, which ends up making me a more valuable asset. I wouldn't mind getting into the video game design, although I just want something where I can take somewhere else, if I don't like the field I'm in. I am pretty sure that many of them have that ability but I am just unsure and don't want to commit to something that will eventually be a waste of my time. 

Also, is a 24 week full time coding boot camp a decent amount of time? I really would prefer this 2 year one I found in Los Angeles, but if it comes down to it, I will take a 24 week program. I just don't want to do a 12 week as I feel I won't learn enough to be worth any value to a company, especially with no computer science background aside from building bots to cheat on quiz games lmao. 

Any opinions and possible options would be greatly appreciated. ",4,2

But I have other reasons why I want this second master's degree in computer science.

1. My master's in cyber security is useless on its own, based on my experience.

2. This degree will be from a university that I REALLY like, better than the one I attended.

3. I felt rushed back when I was a teenager and a freshman in college. I didn't know what I wanted to do back then. Why in the hell does America rush kids so quickly? Like when you're 18, BOOM, you have to decide what to do with your life. Especially, since I hated school, due to being bullied and friendless, it was harder for me.

4. Most people don't have two master's degrees, so I don't want to look overqualified.

5. A master's in computer science is something I've longed to have, even if it does not get me a job.

6. What would be the best way to pay for this? I already owe $15,000 in student loans. I'm currently working a $17/hr job. Should I take just one class per semester to save money?

Should i pick frontend vs backend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8vk8bl/2nd_year_computer_science_student_in_need_of/,hasanshaz,1530550645,"Background: I'm a second year CS student graduating next year. Currently done intro to Java, MYSQL,  python/django (btw how amazing is django?!). Also bit of web design with javascript,html and css. 

I've enjoyed both. And now i really want to learn js frameworks for personal projects but also want to continue with J2EE java OOP.

My dilemma #1: In order to get ready for the marketplace i need to pick a specialization i.e. backend (java, spring, hibernate) or front end (javascript/react/angular, html, css). The problem is I want to be a full stack ideally but also realize its smarter to pick one stack initially and become competent to be job ready (1.5 year until graduation). . 

Question 1. Is it realistic to focus on becoming a full stack as i graduate (1.5years left)? Or pick one path and be REALLY good at it. Im an average student and know it will take time/energy to be good at any given path.

My dilemma #2: imposter sydrone. Yup, i don't have real workplace experience atm so i don't  know if I'm good enough. Assignments are great but not the same as working on real projects with colleagues and deadlines where you actually have to know your department.

therefore i think doing front end would be easy vs backend to get started? Even though i really enjoy OOP java a lot too

Any insight from your experience for new graduate would be so helpful! (I've been over thinking too much)

The bigger company offers position that allows me to play with all kinds ofdatabases and test their driver programs on cloud. It's okay-ish...but the package and perks are what keeps me confused.

I'm a recent graduate. Need advice on which career path will be eventually better. ",11,1

This was many months ago, and every now and again ive run the drive wiper again and again, so I imagne those files have been overwritten multiple times now.

Now, whats happening is the police have siezed my computer, and in 5-8 months they will analyze it and try to find this ""stuff"" and if they do I will face action.

I am looking to buy a new laptop for university next year. I will be studying computer sciences. 

I was looking for a laptop that has/is:

* 15'' screen (great balance between portability and usability)
* Great battery life (I want to be able to go through a full day of school without charging since finding a wall outlet can be rare)
* Powerful for some heavy tasks and game development.
* Good GPU for some light gaming from time to time (no not at school but at home ;) )

The laptop that I am considering to buy is the new Dell XPS 9570 (i7 coffee lake, 16gb RAM, 512gb SSD, 1050ti and amazing battery life).

What do you think? Should I go for the XPS or are there any alternatives.

**Note:** I am living in Belgium so some laptops aren't available here: Matebook Pro X, LG Gram, ...

Server two:
4gb RAM
1 Core
25gb SSD

Both offers are by popular German hosting companies. Obviously server number one seems like the better deal for your money but Im not sure about the hybrid drive. Do you think a real SSD is more important than cpu core count and the RAM size?

So HMAC will hash an encrypted message. However it will hash a (message + key1) and then hash the results with key 2. and send the encrypted message and hash.

This is fine. The reason for not just sending a message + hash of message is obviously that a person can just generate a new hash with an altered message and they will still match up.

However why not just send the encrypted message + a hash of the real message?

The sender and recipient both have the decryption keys so if the receiver first decrypts and hashes and then compares to the hash sent, it will work. The likelihood that a middle man will alter the decrypted message in such a way that when the message is decrypted with a key they don't know and then hashed it will match any hash they could provide is sufficiently low.

I'm 26 years old, I just recently finished my studies in mechanical engineering and I decided I want to invest in learning computer science.

I am very interested in learning about Big Data and IoT. My knowledge in computer science is very limited - I have used C++ and Matlab (and actually enjoyed a lot the creative aspect of coding and making algorithms). I know almost nothing about hardware and architectures.

By next summer, I will have graduated with a BS in Computer Science. I enjoy the field and it's something I feel like I can do a lot with, I'm definitely interested in it.

The problem I run into is that I feel so inexperienced. My older brother studied com sci for seven years (retaking courses that he didn't do well) and he did a few projects over the years, but he couldn't find any work for a while and even now, he's under paid and at a job where, as he describes, he doesn't do a whole lot of coding. What I'm trying to get at is, I don't want to land a job like this. I'd like to shoot big and go for something like Google, but I'm fairly confident that that is currently out of my realm of possibility at the moment. 

I haven't done any real personal projects, nor have I interned anywhere (these are the two biggest things I hear that com sci majors need to do) so I fear that I will appear undesirable to any potential employers. I make great grades in my courses (received my AS with above a 3.5 gpa, currently have a 3.4 as I transferred to a university last year) but don't think this will be enough. 

My questions here and basically a Tl;Dr:
How can I, as a senior in college with no experience in the field, become more desirable to future potential employers? 

What sorts of projects away from school projects do employers like to see? I've coded a few algorithms in regards to graph theory using python, though c++ is my native language.

What are some must-know things every com sci person should know before going into an interview?

What have you done in the past to ""set yourself apart"" from the competition?

These are just questions to get the ball rolling, feel free to add or just answer whatever you want.

Feel free to delete if you deem it necessary.

Some background: I'm a recent CS graduate who just graduated and is immediately starting MS in a different country (the USA) 

This is me attempting a back and forth conversation with myself to try and find out why I'm being feeling down and out off and on these past several weeks. I'm in a better place now, I think. But things were bad. And I realize some of the below might stink of entitlement or whatever, and you'd be absolutely right. I'll aim to be better.

&lt;Begin&gt;

Everyone feels alone man. Every human is a ball of insecurities. The bravest thing you can do is open up to them.

&gt; But it feels like.. I don't want to burden someone else with my problems. I do want someone to listen, but what right do I have to demand emotional labor from someone?

I'm here. What's on your mind?

&gt; Same as before. Not feeling good enough. Doubt. Seeing all these people accomplishing and what do I have? an overcomplicated email reminder. I see people in this industry making waves: people who are self taught, people who started coding young, people who started coding when they were much older than I am now. All these people who found their way into the industry and I'm still here, about to go into several thousand dollars in debt.

Would you be happier if you followed their route? If you made your way into the industry by self taught means?

&gt; I don't know.

Are you jealous that they didn't have to do what you did? That you had to spend several years in university when they didn't have to?

&gt; I don't know. Maybe a little.

Do you feel like they do not belong here?

&gt; No. Of course they belong. Would I feel this way if I thought they didn't belong? They are an essential part of the industry.

Would you feel better if these folks were not allowed in because they didn't go to university?

&gt; Would I? No. What right do I have to gatekeep?

Do you want to stop university? Rescind your application and try your luck on your own?

&gt; No. A large part of me wants to go to university. Wants to do the MS. 

And yet you complain about the debt, despite knowing and accepting it?

&gt; Pathetic, isn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; I think I know why I keep the MalwareTech tweet around. It's a form of masochism on my part. I go back and read all the comments making fun of the fools who are going to university and exemplifying their own accomplishments which they achieved without needing a college education. The comments ARE targeted at the idiot kid who is the subject of the whole thread, and the achievements of the individuals in the comments cannot be detracted. They have every right to make the comments they did.
&gt; 
&gt; But I cannot help but feel the words target me too. And it hurts seeing them. It's foolish to think that, I know. I'm not being rational, I know. But still, it hurts. And I still think about it. I still go and read it. See what I mean about masochism?
&gt; 
&gt; If those folks see this, they'll just make fun of me too. They'll have every right to because I'm being fucking stupid. How can I talk to someone about this without being hit upside the head? 

What do you want?

&gt; I just want to be validated. I just want someone to tell me that my four years of college weren't a waste of time. I just want someone to tell me that the two more years I'm going to spend in college won't be a waste of time. That I will be able to find and experience things there that I can carry out into the world, something no one else could possibly have gotten. 

That is the nature of any path anyone takes. Each person is going to find something different in their life paths that they will carry. The self taught folks found things that you can never hope to find. You'll find things that they can never hope to find. Is it that you want the things that you find to be better and worth more than the things those folks find? You want to feel that you are better than them.

&gt; Is that the vibe I'm giving off? 

It is. You want validation for the path you are taking. You want validation because your feelings were hurt ever since that day you read that thread. Ever since you saw those comments making fun of the path you took. Is this not just you being childish?

&gt; ...

I can understand wanting validation. Everyone does. That is ok. But why do you want to feel like that you are better than the non university folks? They have every right to be here, just as you do.

&gt; I just don't want to be mocked because I chose this path when there are other avenues into the industry that those folks used.

And you won't be. Anyone who mocks you unsolicited is a shitty person, regardless of their background. People have no reason to be shitty to you as long as you're not being shitty to them. This wanting to be superior will get you mocked.

You can be better than this. Go to university. Get into debt, we'll pay it back. You chose this path. You know you want to follow through. Own that shit. Don't let anyone take your choices away from you. They have no right to.

I was wondering if there's a way to extract location history from google maps, for say the last year or two.

Then with that data, whats the easiest way to make that data useful. (I have no programming or data experience but I'm willing to learn, it will definitely be useful in my engineering career).

For example, I want to see what the most typical length of travel in one day is. I know my daily round trip commute to work is 40km, so I expect it to be about that. 

But how about average weekend travel distance? Maximum?

How many times in that period do I travel over 100km in one day? 

How about summer vs winter? How about ignoring long weekends? Can I easily remove outliers like road trips?

There are so many questions I'd like to ask, and the data is there (at least i think so) but I have no idea how to go about manipulating/extracting it.

Lastly, if I can make it pretty (i should look into data visualization), and easily manipulated by someone non-techy; that'd be the icing on top. I wonder if there's already pre-written software that will do this, or that can help me do this. I'm not super interested in doing this from absolute scratch (mostly because I'm intimidated AF).

As you may have already guessed, I'm doing this to see the feasibility of getting an electric vehicle to replace my ICE one.

1) via HTTP POST is real-time identified by device ID with a timestamp

2) Send batched data when done using the app via csv

I feel like #1 may be problematic?  If the data is coming in realtime, the only method I can think of is that each POST is saved to the database immediately which seems like can be an expensive operation given that its a connection and an insert to a database for every single POST (frequency is every second for several minutes). I don't know if it's possible to sort of group up the data till the POSTs stop and then handle adding the data to the database?

The other option is to just email a csv to a server that will then be processed. I like the idea of going the POST route but not sure if it makes sense to handle the data in realtime.  What do you guys think?",0,2

Question 2D:
&gt; There is a subroutine, HEX(), that takes a denary number between 10 and 15 and returns the 
corresponding hexadecimal number. E.g. HEX(
10) would return A, HEX(15) would return 
F.

Answer 2D:

    INPUT decimal

    digit1 = decimal DIV 16

    IF digit1&gt;=10 THEN digit1=HEX(digit1)

    digit2 = decimal  (digit1*16)

    IF digit2&gt;=10 THEN digit2=HEX(digit2)

So, the fact that the hex function can only accept a denary number between 10 and 15 means this cannot possibly convert ***any whole decimal number between 0 and 255*** right? Am I missing something here or is this a really poorly worded question?",4,15

This specific masters program at DePaul University is a pretty solid fit for me because it is designed for people to become computer science graduates without a degree in CS at the undergrad level.

So a want to make a mobile application that is based on a website.

It a simple website so this is possible.

So the problem comes because user will need to input their credentials which will be saved on their mobile phone. To clarify I would not save any of the data that he inputs or is shown from the website I would only save it on their phone. So as I see it this is called cache. I would never send any of their data to my server. 

So as I see it I am writing a site specific browser or [SSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser) but without accessing to back end.

1) I realized many departments that are very dependent on computer science (I actually work in analytics, not software development), are just full of people with no formal training on it.  They will write awful code and have no idea why it runs so poorly.  I seem to have a knack for cleaning it up, but it feels strange to always be advising people on something I have no formal training on.


2) Yes, you can google the answer to anything, but you don't know what you don't know.  And a teacher will force you to study the boring parts that many self taught people overlook.  I have coworkers who desperately need to learn the low level differences between integer and character variables; and don't know how big of a gap this is in their practical knowledge.


3) I've been exposed to some communities of self taught programmers who will brag about things they built in python like they think it's brand new computer science, while obviously having no idea if they built the Taj Mahal or a child's pillow fort.  I'm NOT here to bash python, this is just to show a pitfall of pure self taught knowledge.


4) I actually like theory!  I love math (was close to finishing an undergrad in math) and was considering pursuing an advanced degree in math, but my favorite kind of mathematics is all around computer science, so thought a comp sci degree would be a better option while also being more relevant to the jobs I want.

Cyber security and forensic work(working with law enforcement). Ive always found cyber security  very intriguing but Id love to hear from both sides.

1. What is your degree in and/or your certifications in?
2. What is your position and what is a typical day at work like?
3. How many hours do you work per week?
4. In my research, Ive struggled to find employers looking for new grads.  What was your first entry level job out of college/after getting a degree/certification?
5. What are some of the most  important basic certifications that everyone should get within the cyber  security and computer forensics fields?
6. If possible, what certifications should I try to get BEFORE I graduate?
7. If youre comfortable sharing it, salary and/or benefits?
8. Will my associates degree in business be irrelevant to this field? Resume, job titles, etc
9. What kind of math, if any, do you use daily at your job?
10. Are you happy with your decision to choose the field of computer forensics/cyber security or do you regret it?

I wanted to have some sort of structure to it which helps me, even if there was at least something.

Here are several things that occured:

* 1 assignment everyone gets 100 on even if they didn't do it and you spent a solid week researching and doing it 

* When 80% of the class is him chatting with students about vape and if one should start a vape shop business

* When there's ""no curriculum"" so you never have a lesson

* When in class discussions are 5 minutes of shallow discussion before he gets bored

* When there was one PowerPoint on like week 5 (the first day we did anything) and you get through 6 slides and he stops for no reason

* When your programming language is processing which you've never used and is not what is used on the exam, and what you learned about actual Java two/three years ago isn't refreshed or strengthened

* Let's the class run amok and does nothing to stop it.

* Everyone sits on phones or Steam every day

* Mario Kart tournaments or class parties for no reason

* Doesn't know Java???

* AP Practice problems are never explained or gone over, and even if they're gone over it's all based in Processing which is slightly different

I will be attending North Dakota State University this fall hoping to complete a B.A. in CS.

I just graduated from high school, but I began college full-time in 11th grade and already have my 2-year degree, so I will be done with my CS degree in about 2 years. 

I have begun working with python and getting familiar with it (I am aware they may or may not teach python, I just wanted to get a grasp for code) and I really enjoy it. Coding is very fun to me and I am very passionate in pursuing a career as a software engineer/dev. My father and siblings are all electrical engineers, so the tech/science has always been apart of my life, but not anything to do with software!

My questions:

I am not sure how accredited NDSU is, but I assume it's good enough. What I am wondering is whether a B.A. will affect my future career opportunities. I chose a B.A. because I would like to learn a language and math is not my biggest strength. Will companies look down on me for not taking Calc 1 / 2? 

Will I have trouble finding internships (assuming I get a 3.0 or above in all of my classes) because I will only be around for 2 years? Before I know it I will have graduated. Will I be behind as far as the internship hunt since I will be on a bit of a fast track for courses and won't have as much time to do a ton of projects on the side like others?

What languages should I primarily focus on for today's world? I did a bit with HTML and CSS and I liked that, I think web development would be fun but video games not so much.

I dont apologize for anything as this is reality.)

PLEASE DO YOUR MATH AND STATS! This is the best advice i can give anyone out there! I see many questions on here about how relevant is calculus and linear algebra in the workplace. Let me answer that with a simple statement: You can work for me or you can work with me.

Ive hired quite a few people that went to some school for Web Programming/Angular.js/blablabla framework bootcamp/shortcourse and yes ive hired them for the going rate of what a web developer but the problem is they remain right there, with no chance of moving up. Ive heard all the complaints about ""Not progressing, not going up, not being given enough opportunities to do more serious stuff..."" All they end up doing is converting excel spreadsheets into databases and make front end forms to fill the data.

CS is definitely not programming - get that out of your head! At some point, every business/workplace has some challenges that need those special CS skills to solve. And people with CS are very hard to find usually only 2-3&amp;#37; of the resumes i go through have proper CS in them. 

At my previous job I was work in metal mining and I had hired a CS kid for his co-op term and he didnt even know half of the programming languages out there but he said he was OK with Python. What was really impressive was his background in computer vision, algorithms, linear algebra, calculus etc. We had to de-water a lake up north in the north west territories and we had to estimate the number of fish in that lake that would be afected to report back to the RCMP, the local government, fisheries etc.

We brought in ""experts"" and nobody seemed to offer a good solution. This kid and I were going to work together on this project. You can imagine the massive backlash from our web developers. They tore me a new asshole, they brought the fury of the god of war on me. But my superiors knew the reason i chose this kid over our existing developers - they did not have the skills needed for this task and we are not a college that can teach them these skills. We tried to explain to them that they need a different set of skills for different tasks, we've even offered them paid training on some topics to get them started however they declined because of the math prep work needed. Unfortunately you need that 4 years of college education for that and we as a company cannot do such a thing. So naturally the developers hated him, excluded him out of their inner circle, would crack jokes at how he didnt know MVC and made fun of him when he was using python.

So we developed an underwater camera system using a few cameras placed in some spots in the lake. Kid wrote an algorithm that could identify fish in the video frames and he used his statistical knowledge and gave us a good solution on how to estimate the population of fish in that lake. We then spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to catch each fish and tag them so they could be transferred to another lake. His estimate was about 94&amp;#37; of the total fish we caught, a very impressive number! After that, all the other developers calmed their rage and they knew there was a clear distinction between them and this kid. This kid didnt know shit about MVC or angular or node and shit but he had what we really needed for us to get our environment permitting completed!

We worked on a few other interesting math-inspired projects until he got caught up by some oil company who was really impressed with the work he did for us and their office was close to where his parents lived so he relocated to the US.

So please, do your math! Ive been through calc and i hated it, but i pressed my nose and just went for it. I even went for the full specialist option in CS, it sucked balls, my life was spent in books and tears. I didnt really know what I was going to do in life and where I was going with all this math but I am so glad i did it even though i didnt get all A's in them lol. It does really pay off especially statistics which will open up a huge array of opportunities. Take up every opportunity you can: teachers office hours, TAs, workshops and anything you can. Math is not hard, youre just doing it wrong. People who are good in math are good at it because they figured out how to elarn math. Take the time and figure that out. My reason was simply i was overthingking math and that was making me panic often. Do it, because that math and stats skill will make you shine exponentially brighter during interviews! Ive known people at other companies offer a bonus cheque and RSU options if their CS candidate would take the offer. 

\###Do not underestimate CS!

Couple of other things i see on here and I can help answer:

\##Do grades and GPA matter? 

No not really, unless we have doubts during the interview then we would want to see how you perform academically maybe youre just the type of person shy in interviews but when left alone you can do the job or at least be able to do the research needed to get the job done. However some companies put in a minimum GPA which i think is stupid as it shows they dont really know what they are hiring so they use the GPA system as an indicator when hiring people - watch out for these companies! Unless they are intern/co-op positions which will use GPA as method of filtering out thousands of applications.

\##What programming languages to learn?

Shouldnt matter. The programming language used varies from company to company and if you are real CS, you shouldnt worry about that because the monkey coding is usually offshored or sent to contractors/consulting companies. We want to hire you to solve our problems and usually that just requires paper and you can prorotype in python or anyting and nobody would care.

\##Unix or windows?

Again for a CS position we dont care. Leave that to the monkey coders to figure out

\##How much math do you use everyday?

Quite a bit! I recently developed an algorithm that categorizes hazard and risk levels of contaminants (Arsenic, Asbestos, Beryllium etc) for underground workers in mines/excavation sites/drill rigs etc and it is almost purely based on statistics. That lower and upper confidence limits and the markov model do come in very handy!

\##Do you use proofs at work?

This is going to be probably one of the biggest points ive ever made. I hated proofs, i hated proving that fucking epsilon lies between whatever... I hated induction.. HOWEVER when i was first hired for my previous job as a CS kid, i had immediate and fierce reception from older self taught employees who have been ""programming"" for 10 years in their basements and were eyeing my position. I didnt understand until years later. Whenever i would create something, a simple algorithm for something, they would attack it and say they can do better or faster. This is where your proofs come in and you can also prove that their solution is faulty. This is where runtime algorithms and other proofing techniques (fucking induction) come in useful - you can PROVE that your solution works and if theirs is better, then they have to prove it using the same notation and technique - because this is what is required when you write published papers. The moment they see the Big-O notation is the moment they will scurry away and say ""sorry were too busy, go ahead with your project""

Because that proof is your defence and your CS degree is the biggest supporter of your claim. That is the fastest way to make your boss feel safe in hiring you for the job. Your boss might not (and shouldnt necessarily) know shit about CS but with that proof document, they can use that to defend you and use that for auditing purposes etc.

\##Can i use university lectures from course era and other online resources?

Yes by all means do it. You can even get certifications for these online courses and they are definitely better than those angular bootcamps. If i asked you to explain the normal distribution and how it can be used, they were talking!

\##Do i need the certifications from these online courses?

Yes. Let me explain why, if I were to give you a task that would affect the health and safety of people, environment etc, then you need to have that certification because if my ass gets audited one day, that cert will show that you are certified by an issuing authority (the college) that you know this field and you know what you are doing.

As I read line by line, I have a dictionary that I check if the item exists in it already and handle the buyer differently - either by creating a new set that I add to the dictionary if the item is not in the dictionary or by updating the set if the item is.

I like to tinker and take things apart physically and virtually such as editing my DE in linux and such mainly.

This is not a homework question, I'm helping a media studies/sociology friend with a quantitative research problem.  

I would like to store the frequencies with which words co-occur with each other over a variety of contexts in a large (&gt; 1 Billion tokens) text corpus. I need to store the word pair, the type of co-occurrence (e.g. word1 in the same sentence as word2, word1 in the same paragraph as word2), and some metadata about the text in which the co-occurrence was found, (e.g. year, author, publisher). So a single row might look like:

    word1     word2   count decade publisher author context_type
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    nuclear   danger   22    1980s     NYT        n/a     paragraph

The frequencies will be sparse and Poisson distributed. I would then like to be able to query the data by date ranges, or groups of authors (for example), aggregating the counts of the results.

I have little experience with databases and am not sure what to use. Do I need related SQL tables (e.g. with the document metadata in one table and word data in another), or a simple flat NoSql solution? The vocabulary is about 50,000 words, so the if every word-word co-occurrence was observed there would be 2.5 billion rows even without the metadata (I think). But probably most of them won't be observed. This makes me think maybe a graph database is a possible solution. Is there a good cloud solution on AWS or google maybe?",0,1

I got sidetracked in college and ended up with a humanities degree and two Master's, none of which are STEM.

I keep coming back to wanting to learn programming, and after reading the FAQ for this subreddit, I have a couple of questions.

I really like the idea of going through one of the structured programming programs:

A. freecodecamp

B. Teach Yourself Computer Science

C. What every computer science should know (doesn't seem like a structured program, just a list of things a CS should know.

D. Open Source Society University.

My job is full-time, but flexible. I would be able to spend 10-15 hours per week in deep work (Based on Cal Newport's definition [http://calnewport.com](http://calnewport.com/)).

Realisticy, I image I would need five to six years of 10-15 hours of deep work per work to gain any kind of competence.

Three Questions:

1. I have not taken a math class in 27 years. I am good at logic. I was philosophy major and also took classes in Mathematical Logic and did okay (although, that was long time ago).

Most of the structured programs above said you need to know high school level physics, elementary algebra, geometry, trig, etc to start their program.

I could brush up on these subjects somewhat, but it would be unrealistic for me to have to spend six months or a year to just learn the math before even beginning to start one of the structured programs.

**In other words, are these programs listed above beyond my limited math skills?**

2. **Is there any other structured program that is more suited to an absolute beginner like me that is not listed on the FAQ?**

3. I realize I can just start a program in which I pick a language, get a book on computer architecture, a book on algorithms, watch some lectures on something like Khan academy, and so on and try to learn on my own without a structured program.

I hesitate to try this third approach for various reasons, since I want a good foundation of what I'm learning, and I like a structured approach.

**Would you folks recommend this approach?**

Hell, I may be too old to do this anyway, but I have been thinking about it for months, and even if it is just a hobby, I believe it would enrich my life.

(I started playing around with some basic scripts and other things and it was as if a light went off at how much I missed doing this sort of thing.)

Obviously, it would remain a hobby, because even if I became competent, no one is going to hire a 53 year old computer programming!

Is my current programming skills is high-enough to make money from it? I don't think so. But I think I can definitely develop myself. There are tons of sources in the internet so it won't be that hard. I also like programming so it will help. But the problem is, I don't really know what to do &amp; where to start. I'm not aiming for a full salary, but I just want to make money for fun. It would make me happy lol. I learned Java, C and Ruby in my Uni, also took the DMBS lectures but as you can imagine, they only teach the basics of it... So yeah, any help is appreciated.

2- I want to write codes for myself. But these codes should be usable in real-life. Not just an a stupid compiler. For example, lets say I want to rename all folders in C://User//ABC, I want to change it via my program. (I know there are other softwares doing this but I want to do it myself)

Another example, lets say I have an mp3 music collection. I want my program to check their bitrates , delete the ones which has &lt;320kbps, and then save the deleted mp3's names to the text file.

Pretty simple huh? Yeah, this kind of basic stuff, you got my point. But now this led me an another question again, where do I start? What programming language should I focus, how to focus on that, or any other tips are welcomed...

I'm currently a HS student, and will be applying to colleges this fall. I've found the idea of CS extremely interesting, but there are several concerns I have regarding pursuing it as a career:


1. I'm good at math. I get excellent grades and everything, but my logic sucks, and if I encounter problems I haven't seen before, it's hard to stay focused, and I usually end up quitting those problems. This concerns me, because I've heard CS does require some amount of discrete math and logic (and I fear my logic is below average)



2. Is it monotonous? Are there any other general skills a successful programmer or CS student usually has? I've taken CS at school but it's mostly some weird theory and algorithms you have to rote learn. That seems incredibly boring, to be fair.



Lastly, if I do need skills like good logic and good mathematical thinking, can I improve that somehow?



Thank you! ",2,1

I would be joining a cs program in the fall. Apart from university, what else should I do to get good internships? I heard people saying that uni isnt enough and you need to do a lot of side-projects and competitive programming to land a decent job. I dont know how the project thing works,however I did try competitive coding on hacckerrank/hacker earth and I found it very difficult(I learnt c++ in high school). Does it mean cs isnt for me??

Or is it just that c++ is hard? I just know the basic and cant really code in it. Thinking of learning java and python now ,and ditching c++ completely

i can find a way to make money just to move out the country and cover a part of the uni costs by myself, i just don't know what to do, since i think i have to start right now.

My father and I have been trying to get a new IoT setup going with the intent of being able to monitor temperature and pressure for his business. We decided to use Synapse Wireless products. Incase it is helpful, we are specifically using an E12 network gateway which is a simple linux computer ([https://www.digikey.com/catalog/en/partgroup/snap-connect-e12/67652](https://www.digikey.com/catalog/en/partgroup/snap-connect-e12/67652))  paired up with a SN171 protoboard ([https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/synapse-wireless/SN171GG-NR/746-1014-ND/1791860](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/synapse-wireless/SN171GG-NR/746-1014-ND/1791860))

As of right now, I have everything communicating properly within the network as I am able to send scripts to the protoboard, tell the protoboard to run them from my PC using software provided by Synapse-Wireless, and then have the e12 gateway pickup the information and relay it to me through through an ethernet connection to my PC. I can also tell the e12 to run the scripts in the protoboard. This is great, but the problem with this is it only works from the PC that has a direct connection to the E12.

Quick introduction....Hello everyone! I am a young entrepreneur looking for some partners who want to collaborate on a tech business idea. I haven't yet settled on any idea in particular, and I want to get several fellow Redditors together to brainstorm some project ideas. I have a computer science background, and I am looking for more people with technical backgrounds as well as other backgrounds that relate to business, marketing, or really anything that could be of use. I am currently a rising third-year computer science student at a large university in the USA. 

**What's in it for you?** 

Consider this an opportunity to gain experience as it relates to young entrepreneurship. Maybe you're like me, and you're trying to (in the future) land a job at a top tech company. These companies often have some of the most competitive recruitment processes in the world. When these companies see that you've been involved in a startup from the complete beginning, recruiters are impressed. If this startup comes to fruition, this can be an incredible addition to your rsum.

**!! THIS IS NOT A FULL-TIME JOB !!**

This also means that nobody will be compensated  :(  Unfortunately, this simply isn't something that will be even remotely possible unless we become profitable. That's kinda what generally comes along with startups that are at this stage!",0,1

So, just to introduce myself, I'm 20 y/o, studying for a CS Bachelor's degree and also an intern at the intelligence area of a bank.

You can pretty much assume by this little bit that I'm just starting my career and have a lot (a tremendous lot) of stuff to learn right? And I agree a 100% with you.

But... do you know what I've always liked to do and also helped me to learn a lot of different things in my life? SHARING.

That's right everybody, I've always been the guy who talks to everyone in the group, the one who likes a good chat (and have learned how to actually learn useful stuff from these chats).

So I thought to myself, why am I in this new stage of my life not sharing daily problems related to CS, Unique University experiences that only happen on universities, something I found online that could be helpful someway or another... And the reason I'm not really sharing these and other experiences is because I don't have much friends into CS, BUT I HAVE YOU!

Okay, now once and for all here's the deal, what would you guys think of an 1 hour or maybe 1 hour and a little bit chat on discord per week, where we could talk about something that happened at work, at uni, at starbucks, whatever, SHARE our experiences with each other, looking for our own development.

If you like CS you probably already know that we learn a lot with each other every single day (stack overflow is the proof of that right) so, if you already know and also like that, I know your gonna love this idea as much as I do.

So please, if you are interested and would like to SHARE your experiences with other CS (or maybe not, who knows) mates in order to have a great time meanwhile learning something new, just say NEYMAR in the comments below and I will definitely create the discord group and later decide the best day, time, etc (boring stuff).

PS: You may see this post in other subreddits related to programming/cs but just don't bother.

So any machine with a JVM can intemperate and run this bytecode, making it portable. This is where my confusion on the subject is; surely at some point machine code must be generated to execute commands.

I am a computer engineering student from Turkey. All of our curriculum is based on computer science except for 1-2 class, so I am writing over here. Anyway, I am extremely dissatisfied about my university, the city where my university is and my life in this circumstances. Little background can help maybe. My dad, my uncle, 2 of my cousins are has full time jobs. My dad works for government as a developer, my uncle works as freelancer for now, one of my cousin works as software engineer in a big company in Vancouver/Canada, his brother is also Software Engineer in Los Angeles/California also in a big company. I really do love Computer Science. I am passionate to learn anything about it. It may be a common in Europe and US but there are no place to learn programming in Turkey if you're child. I was extremely lucky to have a family who are familiar with computers and programming. I started coding when I was 12. I am 22 now. I do coding with love. I don't really go to parties or anything. I am usually at home, reading books or coding. Not because I've got a assignment due to few days, because I enjoy it.

""How I got into this university"" , not really necessary to know but may give some help for empathy:

&gt;!My high school years were worst than garbage. Puberty hit me hard. My social skills were shit. My dad who was divorced with my mom married with a greedy woman. (She was kinda poor, we're middle class family. So she started to say ""my house, my x, my y, my z... as soon as she can"") Dealing with greedy woman on one side, last year of high school I learned that my dad had cancer. (He beat the shit out of it :D He is doing fine now) I decided to take a gap year. I was not able to focus on university entrance exams with too much thing happening. My dad divorced this women. One cancer gone, now waiting for actual cancer to be gone. He started his treatments. In the mean time I was preparing for university exams. In the morning of the exam day, my dad broke his shoulder when he was taking shower in the morning. I drop him to nearest hospital and rushed to school where I'll be taking the exam. I was full of anxiety. I couldn't think properly. My results were pretty bad. I wanted to prepare for next exam but my dad suggest me to go for the best with what I've got. So here it is, how I got into this shit hole.!&lt;

Anyways what happened is happened somehow. I need to look forward. The city is extremely small. That's OK. University seemed all right, too. But everything changed when I started to go to lessons. 

1st Semester:

In first semester all of the classes are mandatory. They were selected by Ministry of Education. We were taking history, Turkish Language (Grammar), Programming Languages, Introduction to Computer Engineering, Physics, Calculus, Chemistry... That's kinda odd, I thought. I want to talk about few classes content little bit. Programming Languages were taught in C Language-supposedly-. First 6 weeks, they taught us the pretty basic algorithm logic. I don't mean the sorting algorithms and such. We just draw diagrams for the programs which calculates armstrong numbers, fibonacci numbers. Not a pseudo code, just diagrams. We had a midterm which we draw few diagrams. After that we started to see some real code. But my final exam were just about arrays in C, using printf function... EXTREMELY easy things... You cannot call it programming.  Introduction to Computer Engineering, our so called professor taught us how to open computer, how to close it, how were computers back in 90's, what would floppy disks looked like... Ask them on both midterm and finals Easy, but completely empty class. I somehow failed calculus and physics, which my grades on midterms were 89/100 for calculus and 100/100 from physics. I objected my finals results. In respond got threatened by my teachers. They said if I don't withdraw my objection, I will not be able to graduate... (?)

2nd semester:

I understand why I failed in physics and calculus. In the first lesson of the physics class, the same guy, who threated me were saying all of us to not the bother to come to class as he is going buy a new car this summer. He means that, all of the class going to fail and we need to go to summer school which we need to pay for every class. Someone told me that same guy made $30k in summer school from students. Physics I and II are not the classes he only gives lecture. You do the math... Anyway, he also added that he is not that cruel, he'll let 10 students pass. My friend was one of the lucky 10, he told me he did not do all of the questions but somehow had a perfect score... My calculus teacher told me to not to come too. Programming Languages II was harder than the I, but again I was not satisfied at all. All we saw was declaring pointers in C, making some structures and the most complex thing we had to do which was our final exam's question was the write circular linked list on C. By the way this teachers don't know who is Dennis Ritchie, or any other computer scientist. Every time I asked a question like ""Why we did this in x way but not in y way?"" were answered ""I don't know, I learned that in this way""... 

3rd semester:

Must fun semester so far. We had Circuit Analysis, Logic Circuits, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Differential Equations... Logic Circuits were given by our head of department. Super old guy, who really can't talk -he uses microphone otherwise no one can hear him-. He has his own powerpoint slides which can't be understood by any human being except himself. Lesson's content was easy. The thing is he did not solve any example, so I had to search through internet, otherwise I failed that class... Circuit Analysis was easy one too but this teacher too is famous with his summer school tactic... I scored perfect 100 on midterm which was EXTREMELY easy. 3 circuit question 2 serial resistors, one with both serial and parallel resistors. Failed on  final exam. Here is the most funny of my entire university career. We took Object Oriented Programming class. What would you expect from it? Object Oriented Design, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Overriding, Encapsulation, Concurrencies, Networking... Nope, First week we learn to declare a class. For 6 weeks we made classes and tested in main class if it's working... We literally made class named cat, if you make a cat object, constructor runs println command which displays ""meow meow meow""... We were asked the do the same in exams... He did not mention anything. We just made few classes in whole semester. This guy has PhD... I asked him why we don't see threading. He replied ""you're not gonna need that in real life.""

4th semester was the same...

I am certainly not happy and not satisfied with my so called university. There is a lot of political shit going on there. There are 2 professor on Computer Engineering Department. One is our head of department. Has PhD in Electrical Engineering. Okay, that's seem reasonable. The second guy, who also gives Introduction to Computer Engineering class, is Geomatic Engineer (?). His Bachelor, Master's  and PhD is on Geomatic Engineering. How can he qualify to teach us CS? As for students, most of them think CS is just a social media account management, or ethical hacking kind of thing. No one is trying to learn something. Either they buy some lecture notes, and last year's exam questions and pass or they just fail and go to summer school. In summer school, teachers gives the questions he is going to ask in a week before. So everyone just learns the answer...

I really don't wanna graduate from this university. I am in my junior year but even now I can see that I am not able to finish this school in total 4 years. Should I take the next years university entrance exam and put myself in a nicer place? Back then I had a lot of serious problems I had to think. But now I have much clear mind. My only concern is to be late. Would I be late if I graduate at 26 years old? What do I do? Should I be patience and wait for a graduation from this place? I am desperately need help...

Another noob question for all of you that has probably been asked here before.:

A lot of sites say JavaScript is one of the better languages to learn since it is so widely used. That being said, other sites and friends of mine say Python may be a better first language and its usage is on the rise. 

Would you choose python or JavaScript as your first language to learn?

Also JavaScript seems to be better for pictures and games, etc. Is python improving to get better at these things or will it always be inferior for these purposes?

I'm a rising freshman in computer science, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything right to prepare for a future career. I took AP Computer Science and did pretty well in the class, although not so well on the actual test. This summer, I have a summer job teaching kids how to make video games, robotics, basic coding, etc., as well as teaching myself HTML and CSS.  This upcoming semester, I'll be taking Calculus 1, Computer Science 1, College Writing, General Psychology, and Orientation to computer science, which I think is pretty standard. 

I do feel a little behind everyone else, because I'm not one of those kids who've been coding since age 7 and built my own computer from scratch, etc. Am I doing everything right so far? What else should I do to help prepare myself for a career in CS?",3,5

The idea is to eventually build a series of videos which describe how computers work from transistors all the way up--with the goal of making you feel like if you had enough time, enough patience, a whole lot of transistors and resistors, a few discrete components and miles of wire, you too could build a computer from scratch.

I've never done anything like this before, and frankly I'm looking for constructive feedback. Any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Note that my plan is to build a series of videos roughly following this outline:

1. Transistors -&gt; simple digital circuits
2. Binary, binary math, addition and subtraction.
3. J/K flipflops, D-latches, edge-triggered D-latches and registers.
4. Tri-state gates, internal busses and the ALU.
5. The ""player piano"" model of microcode. (Note I intend to describe a CISC-style computer, and have appropriate disclaimers.)
6. Loading instructions from memory, translating instructions to microcode.
7. The program counter, jump, conditional jump instructions.
7. Other architectural miscellany (stack register, loading/saving from registers to memory, etc).

Here's a link to the first video; I figure other videos will take perhaps a month or so each. Let me know what you think.

339,2018-7-24,2018,7,24,12,91dw4f,Is a CompSci master's degree worth it for a game developer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/91dw4f/is_a_compsci_masters_degree_worth_it_for_a_game/,arowthway96,1532403091,"Is a master's degree in computer science worth pursuing for game developers? Specifically, will it improve my earnings potential, job stability, and employability as a game developer?  


Some background info: I'm a CompSci student who wants a career in game development, specifically as a gameplay programmer or rendering engineer. Long term I see myself growing into a senior position at a major studio in one of these roles, and still doing hands-on programming work. Alternatively, I'd also like to start my own indie studio, or to work as a freelancer or a consultant within the games industry.  


I'm currently near the end of a BSc in Computer Science, and I also have experience in the game industry both from before I started studying computer science, and from work placements while I've been studying.  


I have a &gt;4 GPA at a top Canadian university and I qualify for an accelerated masters degree program, which would mean I could shave about 3 classes off the 10 classes required for a masters degree (or 5 classes + thesis). At my school, MSc students also receive financial assistance of about \~20k for TA and/or RA work while they're writing their thesis, which is pretty nice.  


In addition to the accelerated masters program, I also have some promising leads for a co-op work placement at a major AAA game studio I have previously worked at. The role sounds right up my alley, I have been guaranteed an interview with them and have some good relationships there. I feel that if land the job and complete the co-op placement with them I'll be offered a full-time job once I'm done my bachelor's degree, and I worry that I wouldn't want to turn it down to return to school. The co-op is a paid position, and the full-time job would come with great benefits etc, and would be in a junior role that would lead me down the path of reaching my career goals.  


My dilemma is this: I'm a mature student, and I'm eager to be done with school and return to the work force. I'm also eager to make the most of my education while I have the chance. I am absolutely certain that I want a career as a programmer in the games industry, I'm just not sure which path to take: Do my masters degree, or leave with a BSc if I'm offered a job.  


I expect a master's degree will increase my earnings potential, employability, and stability, but I'm not sure by how much? These are the most important factors for me (as I already know I love this line of work), but I'm not sure if earning a master's degree will significantly improve my career outcome, or where the break-even point between starting work now or after another 2+ years of school to get a higher degree. I enjoy school, but I also can't wait to be done and start my career.  


I'd appreciate any input or advice. If you have a master's degree in computer science, how has it helped you compared to your colleagues with bachelor's degrees? If you have a bachelor's degree, have you faced any career obstacles? Is industry experience or academia valued more in the game industry? Will I earn more or have any other advantages with a master's degree?",4,2

Nobody has been taking data on when this happens, so I want to create something where I can sort of graph whether the server is up or not over a time frame, that way we can figure out bottlenecks and optimize. Problem is, even though I have a general idea of what I want I'm not sure how I can actually gather that data? Some information I got by emailing about our server:

There is a process running on a separate PC which monitors the server that runs our software.

This PC gathers data about the server, our network and sends it to the Insight cloud application (which also hosts the mailing service).

If the process on this PC drops then we get an ***Insight*** ***Timeout*** email (all monitoring is down).

The Insight process monitors whether:

\- The server is connected to the network. On timeout, a ***Server Timeout*** email is sent (this will happen every time the server is restarted).

\- Software is running. On timeout, a ***Service Timeout*** email is sent (service needs to be restarted).

(and then there are some other exceptions that are specific to the company that sent timeout emails).

Please note that an *Insight Timeout* will trigger all other timeouts. Similarly a *Server timeout* will trigger a *Service Timeout.*

I'm still a beginner in the CS field and have only taken a few of my foundation courses so I'm unfamiliar with where to start here, but I really want to make an impact or create something before this internship ends! Any help or direction is appreciated, thanks in advance!",1,3

I have heard python is the easiest. If there is a language or anything you recommend how can I go about learning it?

I am 20 is that too late to learn computer science/programing/coding?

I made sure that next semester I'm only takin 10 units/ 3 classes: intermediate algebra, English: critical thinking, and compsci-6: intro to programming ( it's only offered online). so that way I would be able to devote more time and energy to each individual class.

Also, how do you make yourself look good for jobs in the tech world once you get your degree? How can I start making myself look good for potential employers starting now in terms of CS skills? should I start creating side projects? If so how do I do that? When should I start doing that? When should I start applying for internships/jobs? this is my second year of community college and my very first year as a CS major (I was undecided the previous year, I sorta still am.) if all goes well I will be graduating with a CS bachelor degree in 4-6 years give or take.

I am overwhelmed. The only reason I am trying this major out is because a someone told me about it a while ago and after doing some research I came across khan academy's cs and programing course, which I am trying out right now and although it is kind of frustrating, I am enjoying learning it. Although its taking me a long time to teach myself and I have to rewatch the videos on Khan Academy over and over and I have heard that future employers want their employees to get things quick and I have always been a slow learner. I have to ask questions about How? What? Why? and When? before I fully understand something and even then I have to go over material multiple times before it clicks in my head. I didn't even know what computer science was until probably a year ago. That being said, I am also bad at math and science. I am starting intermediate algebra next semester. Thats one level below college algebra. I won't be even taking linear algebra until I believe 2020. That being said even though I have had to work twice as hard in my previous math classes (pre-algebra and beginning algebra) I have managed to pass both with B's. Also next fall in 2019 I'll be taking Physics and because I've never taken physics before I wanted to ease myself in so I am taking general physics then the following semester after that class I'll be taking the actual physic classes required for transferring as a CS major. Also I am worried that due to my lack of knowledge on the subject matter I won't understand anything and end up failing the class. prior to this I did sign up for the same cs class but ended up dropping it before the class started because I was so anxious and overwhelmed with fear, because I was intimidated by the fact that I had no knowledge on the subject matter.

And for the longest time my anxiety has been getting in the way of me attempting this course.

I start my very first CS class next semester, here is the course description:

introduction to programming using object oriented program techniques including problem solving, algorithm development, coding solutions, program life cycle and source code maintenance.

I asked the counseling department and they did say that the Compsci-6 class I am taking next semester is the most basic class they offer for CS and they also said it doesn't have any math or science requirements that need to be fulfilled. The only class that needs a math and science requirement is compsci-8 and I won't be taking that class for my major unless in 2020 I choose to do it to fulfill my CS class elective requirement, and I'll have the requirements fulfilled for that class this semester, because my math class this semester is the only requirement that they have for that class.

The CS class is an online class. how would that work in terms of tests? would they be open book?

I am anxious because I don't have any experience and their will be kids in that class coding and doing things faster because they have had tons of experience., because they've been at it longer.

Is it normal to feel anxious and scared about CS in the beginning? I also get really bad anxiety and panic attacks in general. I have zero knowledge in computer science, coding and programing. I am not good at math. In high school I barely made it through trig. In college I am in intermediate algebra.

What can I do that will help me see if CS is the right major for me? I know people that are saying that since I am doubting myself maybe this isn't the right major for me. And that you should never doubt your major. is that true? should you never doubt your major? I'm scared of failing. and I'm scared that I'm not smart or good enough for this field. But I also want to learn this subject matter, but at the same time I have to think logically. Can I go about this major and succeed, is that possible?

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has gone down a similar path as the one I am on and has any advice. Thanks in advance!",4,6

I'm finishing my bachelors in Public Relations this summer (course ends in 3 weeks), but have had a recent change of heart and no longer want to work in the communications industry. 

After only about a week of soul searching and feeling anxious, I decided to apply for the CS program at my school. I have basically no experience with coding, and I am super intimidated by the course load, high-level math and time commitment (I work about 25 hours a week in addition to school, and my hours will likely go up as time goes on). I know it's going to be very challenging, but I'm trying to use it as motivation to really buckle down and accomplish something more than the half-assed communications degree and the retail job that I have currently.
 
Questions:

My line of thinking for studying CS is: at best, I'll have found something that I truly care about and want to participate in; at worst, I'll still have a great degree that can get me a high paying job while I figure out my next steps - is this the wrong approach to take to the degree/industry?

If I end up with this degree and dont want to be a programmer, are there still other viable career paths to follow with this degree?

Is the market really as good as people make it out to be? I see tons of sites saying that CS is basically *the best* degree to get right now, but will that still be true 3-4 years from now when I graduate? 

What were the most difficult concepts, classes, career choices, etc to you personally while you were getting your degree?

I went from downloading a C++ tutorial to applying to the CS program in about a week - does this seem impulsive to you? 



Sorry for the rambling questions, I have a lot on my mind.

My concern is that I meet a lot of people who study CS solely for the money, they don't really care about their passions and upon asking why they study CS, most people say: ""what else would I do?"" or ""I just want a stable job."" I feel like the more and more CS becomes glamorized, it's become harder and harder for me to find people that actually want to develop as a person, intellectually, for their craft.

I'm also curious if MS programs are doable without a BS background. I know lots of folks who do technical BS and then go into MBA, but seldom the reverse path.
  
Thanks for the help - appreciate your insight",11,1

I basically wanna become a Software Developer. I've always been good with computers since I was young but I have no idea where to start learning. I definitely wanna learn to code or at least have some basic knowledge before I go into college. I don't have any prior knowledge and don't know all the terms that relate to CS. So basically what I'm asking is where should I start to learn everything and if there's a website that anyone recommends that can help me get started. I don't know what I should learn first or what to learn first. It doesn't need to be a free website but I just need something that can help me learn what I need to understand and learn as a Software Developer.,29,19

Calculus seems to only only be involved within a few areas of computer science not the field as a whole.

But even if I decide to enter a math or calc related cs sect, why should I care about being good at solving calculus problems on paper and need to learn the nitty-gritty of solving problems by hand. 

I'm not really saying ""why should calculus concepts even have to enter my mind"", I'm mostly questioning why I should want to sharpen skills that don't seem relevant and will just earn me a good grade and have no value beyond that.

I could be wrong though, and I'm open to be disagreed with. ",8,2

This is may be a really silly straightforward math question, but I am trying to use a known Big-O function to calculate how long my algorithm will take.

I know that my algorithm takes O(n\^3) to run, and that for n=200, runtime is about 0.5 seconds. There should be a way to deduce how long 2000 points will take to run, but I can't wrap my head around it. Does someone know whether I have enough information to answer this question, and how I would go about doing so?

Also one dollar here is worth 7 or 8 times the local currency, people who make 200$ to 400$ a month here are considered ""rich"" people. So travelling outside the country isn't an option not to mention that being from an unstable country will make it harder for you to get a visa.

Where do I start?  
  
My high school grades were pretty ""okay"" (C average). I did really well in my comp sci courses at a community college and pretty much fell in love with the field. Sadly I had been struggling with some severe depression for the past 5-10 years (it's a blur when it started, but it was fairly young) and I never really went anywhere.  
  
Happily enough, I was given the chance at an internship with an engineering firm in Seattle which turned into a full time position. For the past 2-3 years I've been burning my way through projects with Ruby on Rails + Javascript, wrote an analytics collection engine on AWS with Apache Spark and Scala, taught myself Rust and wrote a (command line tool)[https://crates.io/crates/dingus] that I open sourced for the office. Also taught myself some Elm and category theory in the process.  
  
Pretty much I love doing what I'm doing but I feel like a broader education is going to be more helpful (heavy in theory and math) so that I can accomplish more. I'm great at learning the tools/languages, but tools are only as good as the mind behind them.  
  
Where do I start? What schools can you recommend? Who do I talk to? Anything is helpful.

Thank you.",1,2
