I studied for a really long time for this Digital Logic course. I spent ages pouring over the material... at least 40 hours just in the two weeks leading up to the exam. To be specific, the material was: Boolean Algebra, Simplification with Truth Tables, SOP/POS, K-Maps, Logic Gates, Combinational Logic with Gates, Adders, Encoders, Decoders, Comparators, Mux/Demux, 

I was expected to be able to design combinational circuits, maneuver all of the math, design the logic for all of the above and create the circuit diagrams.

I had six weeks to learn it all.

I am acknowledging that the course was considered by the professor to be way too packed: she said it was the equivalent of three courses at UCLA.

That being said, is six weeks enough time to know all of this stuff fluently? Am I a poor candidate for CS or CE because I learn too slowly? I'm worried about Dunning-Kruger, here... worried I won't know how to determine whether I am capable enough for this.

I'm trying to figure out on how to approach creating a phone diagnostic software that would test a phone's camera, battery, LCD, etc. similar to what Apple uses internally at the genius bar. How exactly would you test this internal hardware? Also, would it have to be coded in Swift/objective-c for iOS devices and Java for Android devices or is there something that can be universal?

48,2018-4-4,2018,4,4,13,89mir0,Having doubts computer science is for me -- need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/89mir0/having_doubts_computer_science_is_for_me_need/,ckcs2017,1522817676,"I'm currently a sophomore at community college getting ready to transfer to a four-year university -- I actually just got accepted into one of the top 25 computer science schools in the country!  From day one, my plan has been to major in computer science. However, the deeper I get into college, the more I'm questioning my major and I'm looking for some insight. 

I started tinkering around with programming when I was in elementary school, and created my own games, etc. At one point  when I was a kid, one of these games actually took off for a bit -- which was a pretty neat experience. At that point I was pretty much convinced I wanted to go into programming. I spent all of middle school and early high school tinkering around with coding. 

However, as I grew older my interest in computer science waned. I thought starting of up some new side projects, but could never muster up the motivation to. I would plan out how I would code things, but never execute the plan. I wound up majoring in it because I had experience with it and I wasn't sure what else I would do -- plus it makes good money. 

I did exceptionally well my my first three semesters of college -- got A's in all the comp sci prerequisites, etc. I especially enjoyed some of the math classes like Calc, etc. At the same time, I felt like it was a mistake that I was doing this well -- classic imposter syndrome stuff, heh :/

However, this semester I've hit a wall and I'm not sure if it's because the material is too hard, that I'm not putting enough effort in, self-doubt getting to me, a lack of passion or a combination of these. Here's a list of the reasons I'm debating switching my major:

- I'm concerned about the work-life balance in the programming world: I have family friends who are programmers and they're often expected to take their work home with them. I grew up in a family of workaholics and I don't want my career to dominate my life after seeing the impact it had on my family. Also, the fact that the field is constantly evolving terrifies me -- I don't want to wind up having to spend a whole bunch of time outside of work keeping up
- I feel I lack the passion to succeed: a lot of my peers are working on programming projects outside of class and studying it for enjoyment but I'm just not passionate enough about the field to do this. I haven't really done a lot of programming since I quit making games in early high school. 
- The idea of upper level computer science courses intimidates me: I'm well versed in the basics of computer programming but I'm not sure I'm smart enough or will have enough motivation to understand the nuances of the upper level courses in computer science. It's pretty intimidating to me. 
- Self doubt: I feel like I'm not smart enough. I kind of breezed through high school and the first few semesters of college. However now the classes are getting harder and I'm having to work to understand them. Also, I never really developed adequete study skills or discipline in high school/early college. This is making me feel like I'm not good enough. 

If I switch, I'm thinking I'll switch to IT, so I'd still be working in the tech field but doing something less programming-y and (likely?) a better work/life balance. I need to decide relatively soon because I'm transferring to the top 25 university next semester and I don't have money to waste. Can anyone provide insight on my concerns?

However, even though I want to do it, I'm not sure if I can. The most important thing is that it feels like I'm not as passionate as other kids around me. I'm in 12th grade and taking AP Comp Sci, and it feels like a lot of people in the class (Ranging from 10th to 12th) ask tons of questions and really enjoy coding projects and stuff. For me, even though it is interesting, it feels like I struggle a lot when coding and studying. I've never really done any serious coding outside of class like some other kids I know. It also sometimes feels like the other kids are way smarter than me. I have like a B/B- in the class while a lot of kids are getting As like it's no big deal. I think that just might be because I don't study as much in general anymore. I already got into a college I wanted to go to and am going for Computer Science, but if my studying habits keep up like this in high school, can I really change in college? I'm kind of struggling in AP Comp Sci but it's way harder in college right? Not only that, but I am really struggling in Calculus right now, I also don't study much in that class either. I still think I can do it because once I understand the material I can master it, and I have spent hours figuring things out outside of class sometimes too. The only thing that is making me hesitant of this major even though I REALLY want to do it is my lack of self-discipline to study / not getting very good grades and not enough passion for computer science as a result of feeling like other people around me are smarter and know more. Is there anything I can do?

I thought I could do it, but here I am filled with anxiety during my Spring Break.

My intro to C.S. is causing me great difficulties. I'm learning C++. I understand the basics of what I was taught: I know how to create variables, arrays, vectors, pointers (still iffy a bit), functions, reversing stuff, NOT recursives, loops (for, while, do while), etc.

My first project was printing out ""Hello World."" Easy enough, right? 

The second project was creating a Prime Number Test. I had a bit difficulty in this one, but it was using things I'd already learned. I got that one.

The third project? I didn't get, at all. I still don't and it's already done. The goal was to create Conways Game of Life using a pre-written skeleton by the instructor. The skeleton was mumbo jumbo. A friend figured it out, and tried explaining it to me, but it was of no use. I think of the entire class of around 30 students, only 5-8 got it. The readme file that was provided, was a mess. It had topics that were never fully covered, or were briefly covered but the we were expected to just ""get it."" It had so many new concepts that didn't make sense, that the entire project was a failure for me. I was so fruistrated, and I didn't even know where to begin. Some classmates even made posts on Piazza telling the professor that the readme ""made no sense"" about a topic and he just replied ""What didn't make sense. Read the readme."" He's not a bad professor. He's the best intro professor in my school, but it still leaves a lot to be desired.

Project 4: We're supposed to work in teams and create a program that uses different commands via the command console echo.. have outputs based on the commands (sort, unique, shuffle etc). Simple enough right? I decided to focus on the unique function. What do I find out soon enough? It uses a combination of things we've learned in class AND outside things. Surprise, the readme is still a mess, and it's still a bit gibberish to me. 
I need to use the getline() function (which was never covered), but wasn't even mentioned in the readme. I've been working on one part of the unique project (based on command, print out only unique lines, line count, duplicate lines, etc). It seems so simple, yet I still don't GET IT. 

So right now, I'm typing away hoping to figure out the code, but honestly, I don't know how I'm going to keep this up. This major seems ridiculously difficult, with the instructor assigning projects that we're supposed to ""just get"" with a look at the readme, regardless of the advanced code required. Maybe I'm being a sore loser by complaining, but I don't know if there's hope for me. I hate the way the projects are assigned. It seems like they're made to be as hard as possible to make as many people fail as possible. The T.A. is of no help. He can barely even understand the questions we may have. I've seen friends and classmates alike just grasp concepts, basic and complex, and I'm here still struggle at what could be considered the basics. I am taking Calc 2 along with this class, Physics, Discrete Math(or structures), and I'm doing poorly in every one of these classes, perhaps its the CS class dragging them down (or the atrocious professors that teach them).


Does it get better ? Perhaps am I falling into oblivion and am trying to clutch at any and all things as I fall, desperately trying to convince myself that there's hope yet.

Since Airtable doesn't have SQL capabilities, they decided to build the app on Heroku and communicate the data from Airtable to Heroku, they also host the app on Heroku. Since it's being hosted on Heroku, it's a whole other website that it's only being linked to their current site.

My question is am I suppose to make the tree a struct, or an array

For a struct they would have a ""branch* left"" and a ""branch *right"" but i dont know how they keep track of the parent node.

However Ive seen someone do it as an array, and they had it so, the parent node is ""parent index = child index/2"" then ""right child index = parent index *2 +1"" anf ""left child index = parent index *2"" 

So which way is better? And if you had any links to help me better understand this, I'd appreciate it if youd put in with your comment. Thanks!",3,1

2 - a. Study full time for 2 years to get a master's degree in Information Security?

We have a general outline since I tutor the intro course and one of my friends is a TA for them, but looking at intro courses for other colleges they all differ. One of my friend's intro course is split into 3 semesters covering Python, Python/Java, then full Java. 

The general outline would be to explain CS concepts, why it's relevant to society, jobs, python basics, connecting CS concepts to python to help visualize topics, and then continue expanding on what python can go.

What we do right now in the intro course is have them use loops to mimic appending then we teach them how to use the append function. Basically, have them do the hard way first. 

I feel that way is good for helping students understand the concepts behind the task and to visualize what the code is doing when they type a one-liner function.

I am a high school student in Ontario, Canada, and for a computer science project, we are tasked with contacting someone outside or inside of Canada in the computer science field to ask some questions about what their job entails.

If anybody working in the computer science field could answer these questions, I would be ecstatic. It would be great if you could introduce where you work, and the company you work for (or yourself).

1-What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? How relaxed is your work environment? 

2-How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at your job/company specifically to help preserve the environment?

3-What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?

The project also requires proof that you work in the computer science industry.

Thank you so much for your time.

Yours truly,

A hopeful high school student",9,24

Time Complexity O(V+E).

Problem 1:

Suppose a max-NF on graph G (V, E). Provide an algorithm to correct an increment of 1 of the flow capacity of an arbitrary edge(u, v).

My solution is the following:

    Create a Residual Network G' with the increment at e(u, v). O(E+V)
    If there is an augment path in G': O(E*|f|) = O(E)
         augment the NF. O(E+V)

To find the augment path, use the FF because the algorithm is dependent on the network flow, in this case, if there is an augment, there will be only 1 thus |f| = 1 =&gt; O(E). Since the graph is already at maxflow before the increment, there will be at most 1 augment that will result in a new max flow graph.

Problem 2:

Suppose a max-NF on graph G (V, E). Provide an algorithm to correct a decrement of 1 of the flow capacity of an arbitrary edge(u, v).

    If the decrement causes the flow f(u,v) &gt; c(u,v): O(1)
         Construct Residual Network G' where edge(v,u) has capacity 1. O(E+V)
         Using FF, find path p(T, S) | edge(v,u) in p, p begins from sink to source. O(E)
         Augment G using p. O(E+V)

I know a few people IRL working in comp sci who feel this way as well; their $70-100k starting salaries seemed impressive on paper, but disappeared quickly due to cost of living in tech areas (not just in California, but even in the tech areas of Texas, etc). 

Has anyone experienced this? It been a common complaint Ive seen recently, and Ive began looking for jobs and it appears most of the programming jobs are in expensive, urban areas. The few job postings Ive seen in cheaper, more suburban areas have significantly lower salaries that dont seem to reflect the get rich off of STEM stereotype weve been fed at all. 

Ive done the math and I could have the same living conditions as a police officer in my cheap, nice hometown with great benefits as opposed to programming in an expensive urban area. All the work in undergrad seems to not be paying off.

Alternatively, is it possible to write a program that could reverse engineer the compiler that built it?

If the answer is no because the math and logic does not work out, maybe we as humans are up against the same challenge and will be prevented mathematically from ever cracking consciousness?

In the last two years I became pretty good at using the technology, however the scientist in me dislikes the fact, that apart from python scripting and some fortran (thanks undergrad physics) I dont really know whats going on on a deeper level.


Could you guys recommend any books that could get me into computer science? My main interests are algorithms (cryptography, rng, computation time), Operating Systems and APIs/Networking (basically how computers/applications talk to each other.


In case I gave insufficient/inaccurate info, please guide me in the right direction :D All input is greatly appreciated.",4,11

I am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.

I could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.

I am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. 

I don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.

I feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, ""Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. Theres something magical about that place.""

I think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.

I hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.

*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.

I am in the process of starting a Computer Science/Engineering Club. 

My vision for this club is a place that computer science majors can come converse and work on projects as a lot of our classes are online and we lack astrong community. But also, I want people who know nothing about the subject to come learn. Admittedly, I am not experienced and have only recently been learning but I am passionate about the subject and will have much more experience before it starts in the fall.

My grand plan for this club is a large project that includes everyone who can program creating something of value (and I would love to include a hardware aspect to this also for engineers). When I say value I mean educationally, and also as community college students, having a solid piece of work to apply to internships and universities with. Its no secret that what you do outside of class is more important than going to class alone, so I would love to give other students the opportunity to stand out and qualify for the same opportunities that universities get. 

To add to that last point, if the department saw that our club was accomplishing something with academic and career merit, I believe we could get a nice amount of funding, though nothing extravagant.


If anyone has ideas on what kind of projects we can start, whether it be simple arduino projects (which I intend to do) or more importantly a larger club wide project that is realistic and beneficial to our futures, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. ",9,4

I am currently looking for a better way of counting and storing repeated elements within a set. Currently, the only ""optimal"" way I handle data is enumerate all possible states, search a linked list to find matching states (linked list segregated using the first element of an array as an index,) and, if repeated elements in a set are found, increment the total number of times that state occurs.

Here is an example: let's say we have a set S = {1, 2, 3}. We want to know how many 3-element subsets we can make using the three elements. Assume elements, when used, are not pulled from S. We know that there are 27 total states that exist:

111

112

113

121

...

331

332

333

Now, we know that there are repeat states that occur. What we can do is: store the first state {1 1 1} in a list and later access it and compare it to the next enumerated state: {1 1 2}. Since {1 1 1} is not similar to {1 1 2}, we add {1 1 2} to the list. Now, state {1 2 1} IS similar to {1 1 2}. Therefore, we will not add {1 2 1}. Instead, we will increment the number of times {1 1 2} is possible. That means the iterations of {1 1 2} is now 2. We step through all possible 3-element states and compare them to the stored states in our list. Once that is done, we now have a list of all states; this time, we have saved some space and still posses to total number of possible states belonging to S.

111-1

112-3

113-3

...

332-3

333-1

The total number of states stored is 10 for 27 total states accounted for!

Now, for such a small problem, this should be easy to implement. However; there remains issues. First, is the size of the problem. For a finite set S, the number of unique elements within a set can be represented as S = {0, 1, 2, ..., N - 1, N}. If the problem asks us to pick M elements from set S, our problem now becomes NM. For very large N and/or M, we can see that the time and space for computing M states from N elements from S proves to be disastrous simply for the enumeration section of the program! Second, the list we store our ""solved"" states grows as we find new states. This is fine except, once again, we run into both wasted time and space. As we add another node to the list, it takes now k + 1 searches to find any possible matching states...if one exists at all! That means, for states such as 3333, we may take up to 81 tries to find a matching 3333 state. Imagine now, that we must find a 33333333333333333333, a 320 worst case search! You and I both know that there remains only one single iteration for that state. The program; however, does not at this point.

What I am thinking is storing states as vertices of a graph. It would be like a tree, except that a node may possess more than one parent. Using the original S = {1 2 3} pick 3 (3P3) program data, we can write the graph as followed:

1--1--2--3
     |   |    |
     |   |    B--C--3:F
     |   A--2:D--3:C
     1--2:A--3:B
2--1--2--3
     |   |    |
     |   |    C--E--3:G
     |   D--2--3:E
     A--D--C
 3--1--2--3
     |   |    |
     |   |    F--G--3
     |   C--E--G
     B--C--F

Where a single number represents an elements within a set, a letter represents an address of a node within the graph. For readablility to better understand the graph:

111

112

113

121 112

122

123

131 113

132 123

133

211 112

212 122

213 123

221 122

222

223

231 123

232 223

233

311 113

312 123

313 133

321 123

322 223

323 233

331 331

332 332

333

Questions:

1.) Is storing data using the graph method the most optimal method? It seems much better than the current enumeration method I was using.

2.) Is there a more preferred method of enumerating all possible states and storing them? Lets say that a problem I am working on must include N = 40 elements with a theoretical upper limit of M = 20 elements. Inserting, storing, searching, and optimizing would take a long time using my method of enumeration. Would using the graph method be better?

3.) Let's say we are to store all 52 unique cards in a 5-card hand state. There are 52C5 = 311875200 total possible end states that we are trying for. What would be the best approach to reducing this number for us to store and search all those possible hands?

I recently managed to finish a 5-year Civil Engineering degree. I am now considering doing a postgraduate in CS/programming... but I am having doubts.

I was a top student in high school and while I never loved studying I scored upwards of 90% in national exams and I got in civil engineering university. But I didnt really have a proclivity towards civil engineering. I thought about getting into CS but while I was (and still am) great with computers I mostly just used them for playing video games (my gaming days are mostly over now). My parents were the ones that nudged/coerced me into going to civil engineering and I agreed thinking it was a better career choice. Plus you still get to use computers so it couldnt be that bad right

But when I got in I really started struggling to cope with the workload. The courses were brutal and I often had to repeat an exam multiples times in order to pass. I am not sure what the fault was: maybe the teachers were bad, maybe the courseload was too much even for a traditionally difficult discipline, maybe I had reached the peak of my abilities or maybe I was just lazy and undisciplined. I still don't know which but I am inclined to believe it was a combination of all the above.

With programming Ive had some experience but I still cant decide if its for me. I had a pseudocode course in high school (mostly for loops) where I did really well and I enjoyed the problem solving nature of it. I also had a FORTRAN course in university where I also did well but it was mostly just the teacher giving subroutines (methods) and having to stitch them together so that the program works.

Still trying to find out if programming is for me, I enrolled in a free 3-month Udacity course for Android basic app development which used XML and Java. Overall, I found it quite easy and the teaching videos were quite good. But I was already familiar with most of the concepts, just not the syntax. E.g. I thought it was really lame that they had a video that used an analogy of cutout numbers going into little boxes as an analogy for variables.

Yet when I stumbled upon something completely unfamiliar and unknown (classes in Java) I found it hard to understand. I made it work in the end but I still dont really get it. While I am sure I could understand it if I put some time into it, I am afraid this is just the tip of the iceberg with regards to programming. (I actually got promoted into the next phase of the Udacity course which according to the email only 3% get to qualify even though I didnt do any of the things they said like participate in the forums. Maybe its because I simply finished the course which is something that few people did.)

Im afraid that I if I follow through with the CS postgraduate program, I will spend 1-2 years in a classroom, overwhelmed by new courseload, only to find out that I dont really enjoy working as a programmer at all and my previous experience was just me being happy that I enjoyed being competent in the low-hanging fruit of programming. Meanwhile, I still dont know whether the difficulties I faced in my first degree mean that I wont like or wont be able to cope with a civil engineering job.



So my question is this: should I continue with an Civil Engineering career or switch to programming? I keep going back and forth and being indecisive. I still dont know if theres any job I would really like doing. Should just cut my losses and get a civil engineering job that, who knows, maybe I will end up liking in the end? Or should I push through a get a degree and job in something that I am (maybe) more interested in?

My post is possibly suited for a different subreddit but I want some input from people working in CS or similar circumstances.

We know this is our second post on this forum, but we do not have enough responds yet. We noticed that a lot of you have clicked the link to the questionnaire, but not completed it. We hope you will reconsider and help us. It only takes 5-10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.

We are three students from Aalborg University in Denmark, who seek to uncover how the software industry collaborates with stakeholders, in particular multiple, different stakeholders, and how the industry deals with problems related to this during development. 

We have therefore created a questionnaire on the subject, and we hope you can spare a few minutes to answer it.
The answers will be used to write an article, and we will provide you with a copy of the final article, if you complete the questionnaire.

    }

I'm strugginling to find the error since I'm pretty sure I've implemented this chip in exactly the same way in the past and it worked fine.

As for the full adder, it's the same error message but for line 16.

I'll provide the relevant code for this part also:

    CHIP FullAdder {
    IN x, y, z;  // 1-bit inputs
    OUT sum,     // Right bit of x + y + z
        carry;   // Left bit of x + y + z

    PARTS:
    HalfAdder(x=x,y=y,sum=xy,carry=zxy);
    HalfAdder(x=z,y=xy,sum=sum,carry=s);
    Or(x=zab,y=s,out=carry);


        }

I can't wrap my mind around the error referring to line 16. That's way after the terminating bracket in FullAdder. 

I've browsed the internet and as far as I can tell my implementation is perfectly correct. Any advice from anyone who are proficient in the Computer Processors area? This would definitely be useful for anyone else who are running into the same/similar problems.

I ended up passing with a C, but I was so overwhelmed with my course load with that course and other courses and the thought of even coming close to failing that I freaked out and considered changing my major because I felt like I couldn't handle it, even though I loved programming.

Last semester, a friend of mine had convinced me to change majors to IS, and, it's hard to explain, but I regret it and I don't. Our IS major is in our business school, meaning I'd have to take business pre\-requisite classes before starting upper division classes. I found my econ classes insanely boring, and I just felt they were so easy to me, to the point where I didn't have to try. I didn't go to class half the time because I just wasn't interested and I still did well \(not bragging, but just trying to explain my dissatisfaction with my courses\). I regretted changing my major because I was scared of struggling in classes and switched to something that was perceived as easier. After reflecting, I missed being challenged and trying, learning something that I was passionate about and looking forward to going to class. Thus, I switched back to CS this semester, and do plan on sticking with it. I had to learn the hard way unfortunately, and will be graduating later, but after changing majors, I realized CS was what I actually want to do. 

I also am behind my university's student newspaper's website, and I started the job last summer, since I loved web development and wanted to get more experience. They said I only needed to know HTML and Wordpress which I had, so, this being my first web development job, I applied. When I interviewed for the job, I felt nervous, and after it was done, I felt like I did terribly for some reason.  I was surprised when they offered me the position, and after some hesitation, I said yes. However, I was even more surprised when I took over, and there were so many issues with the front end and back end of the site. It was slow, terribly designed, and glitchy.  I was responsible for a complete overhaul of the site, which I was fine with \(I actually looked forward to it\) since I was more experienced with front end development. However, a lot of issues that were preventing me from redesigning the site were on the backend, something that I had no knowledge of \(like PHP\). I remember feeling like I wanted to quit, that I wasn't qualified enough to be responsible of the overhaul. After calming down, I contacted the host and had them sort out the backend issues. I was able to redesign it and fix a majority of the problems with the site and give it a much cleaner, more organized, look. 

In short, I obviously have a toxic pattern of doubting myself and feeling like I'm not qualified or good enough when I run into an obstacle. I look back at my feats and realize that I'm overreacting and that I CAN do it, but only after they're actually finished. I still feel this way after even after what I've accomplished. I'm afraid this habit will lead myself to sabotage myself in the future, since I know CS is extremely challenged and running into obstacles or struggling is inevitable. Also if I'm offered opportunities that could further my career, I don't want to freak myself out and miss out thinking I'm not good enough. ",1,1

Eastern Michigan University has a Major called Simulation, Animation, and Gaming where you study game development, programming, story creation and some animation/3D modeling. This sounds like an awesome course and I would really like to take it but is it right for my future.

Michigan State University doesn't offer a Game Development course but they have a very reputable computer science course and this is where my indecision kicks in.

Lets say I go to EMU, I major in S.A.G and I minor in Computer Science. How likely am I to actually get a solid career going with this education? Am I better off getting a real Computer Science Degree from MSU and then maybe learn game development as a hobby later in life?

What has a more promising future? Please leave all the feedback you can write!!

However, there are a few questions on my mind that I would like to get some opinions on.

Between a pure CS degree and a CS degree with specialization in software engineering such as this:

[Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) in Software Engineering](http://www.tarc.edu.my/focs/content.jsp?cat_id=A714E192-1AFC-4032-83A2-4FC74F965841&amp;fmenuid=865E8356-6941-4433-BD16-41CB838AE326&amp;fsubid=0E0835BB-3CEB-46F9-963D-72ED35BE303A)

or this:

[Bachelor Of Computer Science (Hons)] (http://iumw.edu.my/programme/faculty-of-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics/degree-in-computer-science/)

I'm pretty torn between the two as the first one offers a diploma in computer science and computer mathematics program which leads to a degree in computer science with specialization in software engineering. While the second one starts at a foundation and leads to a degree in computer science.

1. Should I opt for the first or the second one? I'm inclined to the first one because I can get more practical experience in the diploma program. The second one is better as its a more general degree, but I will have to start with a foundation instead of a diploma, which touches less about computer science compared to the diploma. 

2. I feel like I might be limiting myself if I went for the specialization instead of the general one and it might hurt my future prospects if I want to switch from like software engineering to networking field. Is the effect big enough of a concern? Currently I'm interested in working on software but in the future things might change.

3. Are there any other things that I should consider before taking any one of them?

I have just been assigned a topic for my undergraduate research assignment which my advisor told me is ""QEMU overhead optimization"". Basically, he explained to me that what I will be doing is finding out ways that I can reduce the overhead of QEMU and run some benchmarks. 

This semester I am taking an Introduction to Cloud Computing since my academic advisor is also the lecture for that class and also a course related to my research assignment as I was hoping to get a head start. 

The problem I am having now is that we recently did an assignment for this class on QEMU (live migration) and for me it was very boring. Now I worry that my research assignment is gonna suck because I anticipate that when I encounter difficulties I would lack the motivation because it's not interesting to me.

A topic that I am very interested in these days is Machine Learning (I know, almost everyone is), but I would some suggestions or maybe advice on maybe some undergraduate research topics that  would allow me to hopefully encooperate Machine Learning and Cloud computing so that I can make efficient use of my time taking this class.

What if computers could use different signals, and for simplicities sake well use  voltage, to make even more values per digit. This would require something akin to a voltmeter to distinguish values so its probably size-wise not practical but its an easy example. It can be anything.

For example, the current Binary system converts ON and OFF signals to numeric values:

OFF = 0
ON (~5v) = 1

An hybrid Analog voltage based system:

OFF = 0
1v = 1
2v = 2
3v = 3
4v = 4
5v = 5
6v = 6
7v = 7
8v = 8
9v = 9

Again I know adding a voltmeter to a computer chip would make it large and cumbersome but this is just theoretical now. There are probably better ways, like wavelength, etc.

Analog signals can hold a range of signals. For example my headphones (analog) contain only two wires, thus two signals. But with only those two signals I can hear the entire range of notes. This wouldnt be possible with only I/O signals.

And while sensors like that are probably mostly a matter of size, remember that some of the old computers like the Mark 1 were enormous.

My voltage may be a dumb example, but I just did it to keep things simple. Lets take a chip that uses fibreoptics for example. The human eye is able to distinguish almost infinite different colors based on the lights wavelength:

https://imgur.com/gallery/ICe7MQK

Imagine a computer that used fiberoptics instead of I/O electricity. Light is significantly faster and can hold almost infinite values. Not just 1 and 0. Depending on the length of the light wave could be set to represent different values.

So back to my example of a 1-10 voltage based computer, we could make logic gates that could add these voltages together making an analog adder gate. So

1st digit: 1-10
2nd digit 11-100

5v+7v=5 in digit 1, 7in digit 2=75

In binary you need almost 7 bits to get up to the number 100. With an analog system you need just 2.

And Currently a digital 4 bit system can only hold numbers between 1-10, whereas a system like this could hold up to 10,000!

[2][2][2][2]
[8][4][2][1] (4 bits holds 1-10)
With an added hat But with 10 values it becomes:
[10][10][10][10]
[1000-10000][100-1000][10-100][1-10] (4bits holds 1-10000)

A 64 bit analog hybrid system could hold 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 values, which is a disgusting number whos computing power is billions of times faster than anyone could ever need.

the 16 bit processor in a Super Nintendo from 1991 could run about as fast as the computers we use today. A Nintendo 64 could be used to edit 4K movies.

Anyway, can a computer science expert comment on whether this is feasible or not or if theres anything Im missing or neglecting? 

This may be impossible or impractical but if it IS possible, it would make computers more powerful by several orders of magnitude.",12,2

It is worth noting that it was not me who chose this course, but my parents. Reason being is that there is money to be made with an Engineering degree even if you barely passed your subjects, and graduated. If I had opted out of the traditional Engineering disciplines back then, chances are I'm at the medicine field which I also don't have an affinity with. I would be there because there is lucrative money to be made\(such as the nursing craze back then in Philippines\).

Right now, I feel inspired by my uncle who is teaching as a professor in the same university I'm studying at, while self\-studying about game development. I've seen him work late\-night, and get frustrated at it, but he does it because he is interested in learning. I think he graduated 3\~5 years ago, I didn't bring up this question to him.

Despite being young, him being 30\(I still consider it young\), he taught me a great deal about things like, needing to learn about Mechanics of Deformable Bodies/solid mensuration if you want to model/create thing in the videogame/gamedev industry. Things like machine learning which Valve^(TM) implemented in DOTA2, which is being used by their new business model\(DOTA Plus\), and how broad of a spectrum CS/IT degrees have.

I am interested at dealing with reason, logic, theory, we even sometimes have heated arguments when talking about belief/religion\(what is the meaning of Life, if X being exists, then why Z happens, what is the importance of beliefs/religion in the modern society, does being dogmatic help you view things objectively, and the like\). However I do not know if I should take CpE or CS. I feel like if I take CS, all the things I learned from EE will be for naught. If I take CpE, then I have to deal with subjects that I am not able to handle exceptionally, but as a pro, I have the previous knowledge from EE, so I have a headstart.

Not to mention that manufacturing industry\(semiconductors/anything related to computer hardware\) has left the country\(Philippines\), and we're more focusing on the Service Industry. So the job market here isn't really that appealing if I take the CpE route.

Nonetheless, I would like to get entry knowledge in programming\(I am eager to do it\), and would like some resources if you have one. I am interested in Java and SQL, but I do not know if these are good starting PLs to study first. Like, do I need previous knowledge of C\+\+ to understand Java/SQL, are they interrelated? I'm extremely new to Programming Languages.

One thing though, I did take one programming class that we're required to take. I think it was Visual Basic, but I feel like it isn't. I do know the look of the general user interface though, it's a lot like VB, but it's not. Anyway, we didn't really delve deep into it. The professor was lackluster at best, I was looking forward to it back then, but never really learned because we didn't have a good introduction. Right now I forgot everything that was taught, because it wasn't of any relevance with my course\(EE\). I only did what was required and nothing more.

Right now, I'm age 22. I do not know if this way too late for me to switch career paths. I feel like it's the end of the world, as if I'm extremely old to switch courses. But I still want to.

I'm returning to my old school and I spoke to the counselor today and she advised me I can either pursue CS as a BA or as a BS. 

If I did BA it would be about 65 credits to complete, 95 for BS. 

I was curious how much impact it will be getting my degree in BA as it's significantly shorter than the BS. 

I was also just thinking if I could just get a BA in CS and then apply towards a masters in CS? That way I could take the extra 30 or so credits I would have to earn in undergrad to just working on it as a grad student.

Recently the place has been going through cutbacks and the atmosphere is just not fun to be in.

My masters project is coming up and I was asked to come up with something that would help them out , so I did . Originally I want going to , but I ended up going for it.  Anyway, my actual formal presentation for the project is tomorrow in front of the board who decides on the projects viability. But after a ""discussion"" with my manager today a few red flags are up and I'm not sure I want to stick with these guys.

Essentially, I am doing the work of a fully paid software testing engineer for 1/3rd what they make, because I'm an ""intern."" Recently the product experts have all grouped up and demanded that they not be asked any questions because it stresses them out too much. 

But, the documentation is exceedingly poor and half of the historical knowledge is ""tribal"", i.e only known by having been there.  All efforts to automate things done manually are continually shot down by this same group of people, leaving me with piles of work that have nothing to do with writing software. 

Basically, I am being pushed on to do more work, with less resources all while making less than 1/3rd the pay off the guy who sits 1 cubicle away. 

 I know this is the nature of the beast sometimes. But it seems like I am shooting myself in the foot by staying here for another year to finish my masters thesis with them.

Should I just swallow my pride and trudge through ? Should I just burn them and do my own project ? With the recent cutbacks, it pretty obvious that the company isn't going to be hiring again anytime soon. 2 people out of a 5 person team have already transferred to different departments and their spots have not been filled, almost 9 months have passed. At a meeting with the regional director, he basically said we are lucky to not get layoffs and to not even try and ask for more help. So I won't exactly be burning a bridge on a job here.

So I have to ask you to please be patient; I may ask some questions that might seem stupid, too basic, or maybe there's terms I don't know and so I'll explain in a much more rudimentary way. This is the first time I build a PC and I don't have anyone that I can ask for help with this, so any answers are more than greatly appreciated.

 1) Some OS are 32-bit and others are 64-bit. What exactly does this mean, and how does it affect the computer's performance? Is there hardware or software that's only compatible with either of the two?

2) What's the difference between 2gb and 4gb GPUs?

I added a TL;DR at the end if this is too long for you to be bothered to read (:

Hi everyone,

I'm in Year 12 at the moment and I was hoping I could get some advice from anyone who's gone to university to do Computer Science regarding whether I can get into a good university without doing Further Maths.

At the moment I do Physics, Maths and Economics. The way my school does Further Maths is that we do the full A-Level maths in Year 12 and the Further Maths A-Level in year 13. I'm in the further maths class (so I'll finish learning the content for the Maths A-Level this year) but I asked the teacher to withdraw me from this year's exam because I don't think I'll get an A* if I do it now (exam would have been in 5 weeks and I'm still struggling on topics like the trig identities and doing calculus with them).

However, the head of Maths told me that they have found that unless people are still in some lessons for the normal maths, they tend to do worse if they do the exam in year 2 because they forget the content. This combined with the fact that I already do 3 subjects (I can't be in 2 maths classes) means that he strongly recommends I don't do both exams next year.

After speaking to my cousin (who said that he was able to get an interview at Imperial without doing further maths, but where they asked him further maths questions), I've just asked him if I could sit in on the Pure Further Maths lessons next year, without actually sitting the Further Maths exam. This way, if I somehow manage to make it to the interviews, I'll have a better chance of being able to answer their questions.

My other option is to drop either Economics or Physics, replacing it with Further Maths. I've heard that physics is one of the good subjects for computer science, and I'm still kind of on the fence between Electronics Engineering and Computer Sci, so dropping physics doesn't really make sense. It probably makes the most sense to drop Economics, but I *really* enjoy Economics. (Also, St. Andrews does a joint honours in Computer Science and Economics, which sounds like something I'd like to do)

I should also probably add that in Economics, I've been getting As and A*s with relatively little work (I know that year 2 will be harder, but hopefully I'll be able to handle it ._.) but I struggle a lot more with Physics (so far, in the 3 end of unit tests we've done, I've only gotten As and Bs).

I know that (assuming I do well in the A-Levels), I could get into one of the mid-level universities with only Maths, Physics and Economics, but I'm not sure about universities like Oxford and Imperial. I mean, I probably won't be able to pass the STEP or MAT but I'd at least like to try. They all say that Maths is the only *required* one, but I spoke to the UCAS officer at my school and she said that she's not known anyone who's gotten into Oxford for computer science without further maths. (She told me to go to the Open Day for Oxford and ask them, but that's in a long time).

I don't think it's that relevant, but I'll dunk my GCSE grades here too in case anyone is trying to gauge how stupid I am (hey, I'm only moderately so): 7A*s, 3As and a B-(English lit is a bitch -_-)

Do you think I should drop a subject and do Further, or is it enough to just sit in some of the lessons and have somewhat of an understanding in some of the topics?

**TL;DR:
Am I shooting myself in the foot by dropping further maths? I can drop Physics or Economics and replace it with Further, but I like economics and physics :(**",7,1

Need your advice.

I need to generate raster images of US state maps that are:

1. Huge
2. Varying size and detail
3. Unfettered by license fees and copyright restrictions

The weapons at my disposal:

1. US Census Bureau TigerLine data and other shapefile sources
2. A decent grasp of C++ and Makefiles
3. A so-so grasp of Python and 9 other languages (2 of which I'm actively avoiding)
4. An OK grasp of the *nix command-line
5. A CompSci degree from a university that makes its money from its ChemE department
6. Some aging but hopefully still valid tutorials on TigerLine and PostGIS
7. All the time in the world (effectively)
8. A non-existent budget
9. Hilariously unfounded optimism

My Plan of Action:

1. Download and Parse TigerLine shape files
2. Plug into PostGIS database
3. Render data as vector images
4. Render vectors to raster
5. ????
6. PROFIT!!


Currently looking at https://www.bostongis.com/PrinterFriendly.aspx?content_name=postgis_tut01 as a starting point.

Next week, my company has asked myself and one other person to work with the developers to try and find as many ""gaps"" as possible for future users of the platform. My educational background is in economics and not CS, so I have no foundation of experiences I can draw on to make these next few meetings as productive as possible.

So my questions for the CS smarties here are: generally when you are doing QA or user experience testing, where do you start? What kind of things do you think about or look for? What kinds of things are often overlooked in development? Any interesting anecdotes from your respective careers? What process do you undergo to ensure that a system is both user friendly and useful and what trade-offs are kept in mind when making these determinations?

I have a Lenovo Yoga laptop but it has been wiped to the lowest grade. I'm trying to find the best/most cost effective way to get this laptop running but am not sure of operating system choices or what would work well with this hardware. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Specs for the computer are: 
Intel Core i5-3337U ULV Processor (1.8 GHz) with up to 2.70 GHz after Intel Turboboost
4 GB DDR3 RAM
128 GB Solid-State Drive",13,0

I understand not everyone like classical music, but I think most people can stand less than 30 minutes which is less than the time we browse a single website, right? I'd like to add background music to my personal professional website, but am worried it will make it not professional. My personal website should reflect who I really am, then I think it should have classical music playing on the background, because my life is mostly made of classical music and software development. What do you think when hearing a background music on personal website? ",9,0
