I'm currently working together with two other students on an university project which features the creation of a dashboard for Microsoft's Visual Studio. The goal of the dashboard is to gather information while the user is coding and visualise their coding behaviour in an appealing and helpful way. This would help developers to analyse their own working behaviour and productivity. We want to evaluate if our ideas are indeed helpful to our target group (professional software developers).

You do not necessary need to know Visual Studio. It is sufficient that you know equivalent integrated development environments (IDE) like Eclipse. 

If you are interested in our project, please fill out our survey which introduces the project and asks you what you think about it. It would really help us, if we know what other software developers think of our ideas. Of course, you can also share your thoughts here on the post. However, we would prefer if you could let us know about your opinion through the survey because it makes the task of evaluating easier for us. But feel free to discuss with other users.

Thank you very much!

Our survey is accessible through the following link: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1Cbxz697PDZwkWALc1M-W2SYdjU2DvFeZN2dRTCiou8buHw/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1Cbxz697PDZwkWALc1M-W2SYdjU2DvFeZN2dRTCiou8buHw/viewform?usp=sf_link)",0,36

I recently graduated with an MIS degree.  Not sure how the courses at most schools are, but mine were primarily focused on business courses with some less technical courses (SQL Oracle, Access, Project management, ect.).

For a year now, I have been working at a hospital supporting interfaces (HL7 messages. Telling/scripting messages to go from point A to point B). To be honest, I am not a fan of the work I do. Might be because I'm in a hospital and the work seems way more technical than what I studied. I don't understand at all the processes and terms in a hospital. Also, I'm in a small town surrounded by corn with nothing to do...

Does anyone have suggestions of jobs that are more geared towards MIS? I have read up on business analyst, bi, dba, and so forth but have no examples of what you would truly do in those roles. I'm afraid if I take on a new role, I may hate it still.

So basically Im stuck, thinking about the ocean of areas that computer science provides, trying to navigate is not easy. Due to this at times I feel completely demotivated. So I go out for a walk and rethink what Im doing with my life. The fundamental thing Ive noticed is how late maturity struck me and this leads me to go down a spiral of regrets. Im in my last year of engineering with not a good GPA score and no coding knowledge at all. Ive always looked down at ""coding"" becoz the way we were taught at uni, left a bad taste. Prior to these placement trainings they did a test to see how many people wud qualify to attend a recruitment program. The results were a staggering null. Except two people. Altho we had subjects like C,C++,JAVA etc none of us were capable to write a proper program. Yes, thats how bad the educational system is designed. Everything was based on theoritical knowledge and never were we taught how to practically implement shit. I hated the the educational from the day I learned how fucked up it was, so I didnt quite concentrate on my studies. Coming into my second year, my grades started declining. I was so skeptical about my existence in this field, anytime I wished to read or attempt to study, my brain wud start to question alot of stuff. But that never stopped me in pursuing other things that I used to do. Ive been particularly pursuing theology in the background. I have a good grip in vocal training for Arabic Recitations. I used to Photoshop a lot in my phone since 12th grade. I still do and people gratefully enough, love my work. When we had presentations I try my best to kill it. I by God's Grace present in a way that usually give this impression of being distinct from the pack.I had a passion for cooking. I wanted to be a chef in my early days, but due to peer pressure from my family I was kinda forced into my second preference. I was always linient about landing a job or doing well. Procrastinating a lot and never thinking about the future the way reality projects it. My results for the previous academic year are yet to come, and Im scared to death.
With all this fear and angst, it has decreased the prompt and drive in me. But Im still confident that if I get my shit together now, I can come out of this situation. Even tho Im not good at coding, Ive enrolled into a bootcamp course in Udemy to start gaining something or the other. Ill be starting CSS, HTML and JAVASCRIPT today and try to work my way through. Ive heard a lot of about UX and UI design, and I somehow believe thats where I belong. Im writing this to get recommendations, suggestions and advice for those in this field on what should I learn? Where do I enroll? What should I master? Etc. So that I can take things seriously and move on with improving my career. I've been watching videos lately where they recommended in enrolling to bootcamps that are way beyond what I can afford. So please give me a pragmatic option.

Ill keep this short. 

I have an interview coming up with a company that designs and makes medical equipment to train surgeons. They are trying to fill a role in creating AR software to enhance the experience and feedback of using their simulators. 

Ive had a long chat with the CEO and software manager, and they both seem very interested in me, and said my CV is a good fit. My background is mainly in 3D graphics and machine learning, with some geometric/parametric modelling and web development. 

I have never made anything in AR before (though I have done some VR), and Ive never explored computer vision, so I though Id ask the community for a little guidance:

1) how challenging is this area going to be for me? The company is not expecting me to blow them away immediately, and theyre happy for me to take the time to learn what I need to learn, but I have to be realistic with them and let them know how much if a challenge this is going to be when I meet them in a few weeks time. 

2) are there any good online resources I could look at to learn these two areas? Im willing to pay for books or something, but free/online would be a big benefit!

I want to go back to school now, and it seems my credits from then are still valid. If I jump right into the 200-level *Advanced Programming Concepts* course (which is the next course and one I qualify for), will I be totally lost or even possibly fail?

At the time, I had gotten an A in the Fundamentals course, but since then I've forgotten how to program entirely. I've taken programming courses in grade school, high school, and college, and always pick them up quickly, but those were always basic courses. I'm worried that jumping into 200 might be too much. Should I retake the Fundamentals course? Should I just try to brush up on what I already learned?

If it helps, the Advanced Concepts course seems to be C++ focused. Here's the description:

&gt; This course is a continuation of CIS-165 C++ Programming I. Topics considered include functions; structured programming principles; pointer arithmetic; multidimensional arrays; fundamental sorting and searching algorithms; structures; unions; sequential and random access file processing algorithms; and the run-time behavior of programs.

So I've decided I'd make this post in an attempt to better illustrate the points I raised. I in no way mean this in a hostile manor but am upset that instead of responses being along the lines of ""Can you explain what you mean?"" they were ""This makes no sense, not one bit, absolute garbage"". So, without further hesitation, I hope this is useful!  


So starting of with the smaller items we can start out using half adders and build up from there, as I'm sure you're all aware the logical diagram of the half adder is as follows:  


*Processing img jtxk5240kn831...*

The truth table is as follows:

|A|B|Sum|Carry|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|0|
|0|1|1|0|
|1|1|0|1|

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we can create our next component by building on top of our existing design for the half adders. We're going to create a full adder. Our design that's in place is:  


[Full Adder Logical Design](https://i.redd.it/9mxhup2oln831.png)

Now again, if we draw the truth table:  


|A|B|Carry In|Sum|Carry Out|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|1|0|0|1|0|
|0|1|0|1|0|
|1|1|0|0|1|
|0|0|1|1|0|
|1|0|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|0|1|
|1|1|1|1|1|

This truth table is a little bit bigger but what I want to draw your attention to is the sum of A, B and the carry input. They're encoded into the 2 bit binary at the output. i.e. the last row, 1+1+1 = 3, or in binary 11. Which is what we can see between the sum and carry outputs. 

However, we're currently only supporting addition with this full adder so we want to be capable of subtracting numbers with this system too. So in order to do this we can use a system called 2's complement, this however means that we're in a signed space. For this project I'll be using an 8-bit signed space.

2s complement works by inverting all of the bits and then adding 2. So if we have 3 (00000011) and we want -3 we invert all the bits (11111100) and add 1 (11111101) which is the binary that will denote -3 in our signed space. Another note to take is because we're using a signed space we can't take into account an extra bit within our output. i.e. if we were working strictly with addition and not an 8-bit signed space then 11111111+11111111 could be outputted as 111111110 with a 9 bit number. However this doesn't make sense with our signed space as in 2s completement 11111111 is -1 therefore -1+-1 = -2 which is true if we ignore the overflow bit we've introduced. i.e. 11111110 instead of 111111110. My point is it doesn't make sense to include the overflow bit in your calculations if you're using 2s complementary numbers.

Now, let's incorporate this into our full adder. We essentially want to introduce a condition that will allow us to differentiate between addition and subtraction of numbers. When this condition is true we want to invert one of the inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

|Condition|Output|
|:-|:-|
|False|A+B|
|True|A-B|

So we can upgrade our Full adder to be the following:

&amp;#x200B;

[Full Adder\/Subtractor](https://i.redd.it/t1db8cugon831.png)

The XOR gate on the input of B handles inverting the value of the bit when our condition is true. If look at the truth table of this operation:

&amp;#x200B;

|B|Condition|B  Condition|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|
|1|1|0|

Now what you can see is when the condition is true the value of the XOR operation is opposite of whatever B is. So this will invert our value of B when trying to do subtraction, and when the condition is false it'll have no influence on the value meaning standard addition will be carried out.

Now we can build a full 8 bit chain of our full adder/subtractor circuits.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img havl5hxkqn831...*

So, everything is setup now and notice how the condition is fed into the carry input at the top, this is what introduces the +1 that's required for our 2s complement. Now the schematic is done and we can demonstrate some values with it.

# Summary

 What I find mildly interesting is that there are permutator algorithms that can recover the remaining solution to a Sudoku after a first row is validly solved.  Once the particular constraints are found. You find these special cases.  *So I'm thinking that if I create a python script asking for these ""constraints"" it may be* ***pseudo-polynomial*** *because I need to use a backtracking method to find the correct constraint.* 

**Note**: Recently, my prior posts have not been well-received. So I've tried to read a book upon discrete mathematics. In an attempt to clarify my ideas mathematically. It's the best shot I got to clearly share. So please let me know if anything comes off strange. And, I'll try to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

In no attempt am I trying to make an extravagant claim that P=NP, but I'm willing to claim that I may have found this method? And, likely not to be the first. It's also impractical and trivial. So just to let you know before you read. Impractical because you have to backtrack the entire puzzle first in order to figure out a permutation pattern to hard-code into script!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to explain on what this ""algorithm"" is and why it might be ""pseudo-polynomial"" for General Sudoku.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The introduction shows that after backtracking a puzzle that yields the correct solution. Also yields the permutation pattern needed to hardcode into the script.
2. Part two explains that there are special cases of Sudoku that can be solved in poly-time ounce you recover this permutation pattern. 
3. Part 3 is an attempt at a proof of contradiction to show that under this algorithm the **number of inputs** makes the special cases of Sudoku in P. One should know that the general Sudoku does not seem to be in P.  
4.  Part 4 is a special permutation algorithm  to show as an example that if I wanted an option for the user to input the permutation patterns that probably makes it pseudo-poly time.  Because the permutation patterns **might exponentially increase larger than the number of inputs. Because you need to solve the entire puzzle with a backtracker! Its written in python. There will be a link of instructions sharing details.**

# Introduction

&amp;#x200B;

 Given that you solve the General Sudoku Problem (any puzzle validly solved). Is there an algorithm which has a hard-coded permutation  and takes as input a valid 1st row of a Sudoku grid and then generates each (i+n)th row of the grid by applying  to the (i+n)th row? To yield those subsets of Sudoku Latin Squares? 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Grid-Generator**\-Is an algorithm which has a hard-coded permutation PP and takes as input a valid 1st row of a Sudoku grid and then generates each (i+n)th row of the grid by applying P to the nth row that yields those subsets of Sudoku Latin Squares. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Shifting Pattern**\- By swapping elements of any valid Sudoku Solution with 1s for 2s, 3s for 4s... etc. As defined in the Example it will output a valid Sudoku latin square. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Part Two

&amp;#x200B;

[zoom in if needed in other tab](https://i.redd.it/dv2l5tcbzr831.png)

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 3

&amp;#x200B;

 

1.If general sudoku puzzles on an n\^2 x n\^2 grid have their first row validly filled then Sudoku partial-solutions **can't** be recovered in poly-time.

2.Given any valid n\^2 x n\^2 Sudoku Puzzle with a valid first row, there exists a permutation pattern that can be hardcoded to yield the valid solution in poly-time.-Shown to be true above

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 4

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a pseudo-code algorithm that shows that there might well be an exponetial increase of the number of permutation inputs. 

That would be larger than the first-row input that would yield the correct solution.

&amp;#x200B;

    print('enter with [1,2,3...] brackets')
    tup = input()[1:-1].split(',')
        #Input required to map out valid n x m or n^2 x n^2 Sudoku Grid
    x = input('Enter mapping valid Sudoku eg. 3 for 9 x 9:')
    e = input('Enter 9 for 9 x 9 ...12 for 12 x 12:')
    f = input('Enter 3 if its a 9 x 9 ... n^2 x n^2:')
    x = int(x)
    e = int(e)
    f = int(f)
        #Pretend that this is an input based permutation 
    pattern. 
        That may exceed the input size of the first row.
    squares = []
    for i in range(len(tup)):
          squares.append(tup[i:] + tup[:i])
            
            #Everything below here is just printing
    for s in range(x):
              for d in range(0,e,f):
                for si in range(s,e,f):
                  for li in range(d,d+f):
                    print(squares[si][li], end = '')
                print('')

One should know that a **n x n** box is the first row in this special case of Sudoku.(mentioned in link) Instructions will come later to clarify any questions that the audience may have. Link below called instructions

Wikipedia says *""a [..] rose tree is a tree data structure with a variable and unbounded number of branches per node.""* which does not say anything about the importance of multiplicities of sub-trees and their order in a node. [A](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~heller/brt.pdf)[l](https://wiki.haskell.org/Algebraic_data_type#Rose_tree)[l](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.2.1/docs/Data-Tree.html) other resources I found seem to agree on the following definition (using Haskell's ADT-notation):

    data RoseTree a = Node a [RoseTree a]

This definition suggests that the sub-tree are ordered and have multiplicity, eg. the following two trees `t0`, `t1` and `t2` are distinct (using `leaf x = Node x []):

    t0 = Node 0 [leaf 1, leaf 2, leaf 2]

    import Data.Set ( Set )
    data RoseTree' a = Node a (Set (RoseTree' a))

Would this still count as a rosetree? If not what about the data-structure where we replace `Set` with a multi-set? If this is neither the case, is there a name for this kind of trees?",0,0

Im (19/F) starting college next year. I took an interest into computer science and environmental studies during my two gap years. I have a genuine interest in these subjects, and would love to study them. Granted I dont know much, but the bits Ive researched myself and seen online really intrigue me.

Now, I told my parents about possibly studying it and they didnt seem that interested or engaged into the conversation that I tried to have with them about it. I didnt let it bother me that much though, as that was all that was really negative about the conversation. That was a few months ago, almost a year ago. My interest has been for longer than that. Today I brought up that I would like to do my first two years at a community college and then transfer to a university (cheaper, makes the most sense considering I didnt do so hot in high school, and is something Im comfortable with) to study computer science. They then asked me why I even want to study it. I replied with basically what I said, that Im very much interested and its something I want to learn about, and would open up good career options. Then came the well, what jobs do you want with that then?, dont get stuck on one subject, wouldnt liberal arts or English be easier for you?, you cant decide before youve even had a chance to go to college, you should talk to someone beforehand type-comments. This bothered me a lot, kind of goes without saying.

My thing is, arent most parents pretty supportive of this kind of thing? Especially with computer science, which is a pretty damn good and cool thing to study and invest in for a career, at least to me. Im not exactly sure how to even go forward with this now. I know theyre looking out for my best interests and such, but it seemed really strange to me and made me kind of second-guess myself. Im not sure how to tell them that this is what I really want to do without them trying to get me to change my mind, since they are going to be helping me pay for it and whatnot. 

Sorry if this is weird, I just wanted to hear opinions and advice from other students/former students/people who work in CS, etc. Did anyone else have this kind of problem?",164,140

No matter you are always busy in your work, it helps you to get a good academic grade directly. If you have a doubt in your mind why students need computer science homework help you are in the right place.

College students usually want some time for them to invest in their hobbies or with friends, but their pending assignments always create some problem. Therefore, most students go to online assignment support services. It gives you the best assignments and that too in a given time period.

I am by no means a computer scientist, coder, app developer, etc. I am a musician who wants to develop a metronome app that is useful between rock bands, jazz combos, symphonies, marching corps, and anything of the like.

The goal is the create an app where everybody can plug in their earbuds and all have synced metronomes. If you have met going over a speaker, sometime it can be hard to hear over blaring guitars and brass or drums. The premise is that one person (leader if group) could set a tempo, and when they press start, everyone's metronomes on their phones click in sync with each other. This would allow ensembles with high volumes or distance between their players to play together for rehearsals.

Thank you for reading and helping me.

I have an Associate Degree of Science in Business, I wonder if I can use it to continue my education to get Bachelors Degree in Computer Science without starting all over again. I mean if I can transfer some credits to lower my tuition and my time it would be awesome.

Also, I have a full time job and I do not want to leave the job because I have family. I really want to get the Bachelors Degree for a better job in the future. So is there any online schools/programs/courses that offer a legit Bachelors Degree? I work from 9am-6pm and will focus on school for the rest of my time.


Thank you.
Sincerely.",1,1

Im hoping Im posting this in the correct subreddit and also Ill try to keep this short!

Im going to be graduating this December with my CS degree so Im trying to expose myself to new things. The student registration for the Grade Hopper convention is something Ill be able to handle so I really want to go (Oct 1-4). However, my schools career fair is Oct 2 and I think thats just as important. 

Im thinking that maybe I could attend the career fair and then come only for the last half of the convention. Would that be worth it or should I just pick one? And if only one, which one? Im trying to be selfish and do it all but Id rather hear feedback from anyone who has attended or dealt with something similar so I dont waste time or lose opportunities.

I know there already are plenty of answers for the best paid job in programming in general, but those take a lot of experience to get them.

Theoretically, what part of CS should a college student learn to use right after finishing college, if the only purpose of the student was to acquire the most money in the shortest period of time?

The question is generally unrelated to the place/country of work, but if you want, you can also include where are the best paid jobs, subtracting the cost of living there.

I recently got my Series 7 and 63 licenses and am working at this finance company. The pay is not bad, but not super great. I just feel like what I'm doing is a random job just to HAVE a job. and that I won't really be able to get much farther than where I'm at. However, I've started thinking that I want to go back to school for something that may give me more career opportunities (e.g. computer science degree).

I've only recently thought about this so I obviously need to do more research about it first. Is there an area of computer science that you can go into if you're not super great at math? Also, I'd be most comfortable with a job where you learn how to do A, B, and C and you're good to go -- something predictable. Are CS jobs mentally demanding in that you're always stressed trying to figure things out day-to-day and you don't really know exactly what to expect? 
A thought I have a lot is that I'm not smart enough and don't have what it takes to go into a field like CS. But maybe that's just my shitty self-confidence talking and I do have the potential..

Anyway, hope you enjoyed this life story. I'm just feeling confused and lost with where I'm at currently. Any advice at all?

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for suggestions for PhD programs in Computer Science with a focus on Computational Mathematics, Complexity Theory etc. Basically, I am interested in seeing if there are Computer Science programs that may be susceptible to investing in someone with a math background (master's) who's interested in applied math. For example, University of Chicago's CS department has a Computational Mathematics track, and I think I'll take my chances there. I'm interested in probability and quantum computing, so I suppose I can consider applying to CS departments.

I passed my first cs class Visual Basic with an A and my second CS class which was intro to C++ with a B. I am a 21 year old girl in this field. The only reason I feel like I passed was because I was going to tutoring as much as I possibly could. Every moment I spent on campus was spent in the tutoring center and I went to my professors office hours almost every single week and I'm not complaining about that. I love learning about computer science but there are a lot of concepts that I have got completely over my head like pointers and two dimensional arrays. It keeps eating me alive that I'm not grasping these concepts as fast as my peers. I feel lost and confused and a little not worthy of this field. it feels like the professors are throwing concepts at me left and right with little to no time to grasp what anything truly means, and I see my peers their able to work full time and take full time classes and grasp these concepts much better and faster then I can and I applaud them for being able to grasp these concepts, but at the same time I'm constantly frustrated with myself for taking two months to grasp a concept that took other people a few weeks at most. I don't know their background some have prior experience and others don't. All I can tell you is that a year ago I could never have even imagined that such a awesome field existed let alone major in it. But I'm scared very scared and nervous. my favorite tutor and mentor who was able to break things down and help me understand a lot of the concepts in the past year has moved on to pursue their bachelors at a university, and i'm scared of going at this alone. I'm trying my hardest but it still feels like its not enough. I love this field, it can help people in so many ways and I want to be apart of this field a lot . Even this past summer I've been trying to review concepts of computer science, chemistry or math that I don't understand. in high school I was horrible in math and science, I was a C student in college I've only gotten 1 c so far the rest have been A's and B's and the only reason I believe that I got that c is because I had lost motivation because I've been going to college nonstop since graduating high school 3 years ago. This is the first summer I've had off since junior year of high school and the only reason I'm taking this summer off is because I had to withdraw from my trig class that I was taking over the summer because it was too much for me to handle, and now I have a W on my transcript. And it hurts that I wasn't able to finish the class because I couldn't handle the pace.  should I continue? Am I smart enough?

 Im international student going to Canada for a bachelors degree. I really want to go to University since its pretty much the ideal way to land a job (imo). In my country, I never went to college. I got immediately admitted at a University and studied there for almost two years. However, as time passed by, I got an interest in studying Computer Science abroad (Canada). A month ago I received my acceptance letter/offer and Ive already registered my courses. However, my parents changed their mind. Since its much cheaper to study at College, they want me to reject my offer and start my classes at college, which I dont agree with them. Maybe its just a biased opinion since I was always studying at university, but I do really think its a much better way than ending up at college. Sure, you pay much more at university than college, but the theory that is taught at university is more valuable than just learning the technical stuff that is imparted at college. Im just pointing my future towards a long term goal/prosperity, instead of thinking about cost. I do think that the investment is worth it and maybe Im just wrong since Im a newbie when talking about CS and I dont really know how the jobs work. They want me to start at college. After that, get a job and work in order to earn my own money and if I wanted, continue my studies at university.

I have been auditing and working through a few online computer programming courses offered by the University of Michigan and although this is not a degree program, they do offer certificates displayable on a resume, Linkedin, etc. if I were to choose to pay for full access to the courses.  I was wondering, if I  were to pay instead of audit such a course so that I could receive the certificate, would it be worth it? That is, would it be recognizable to any future employer as a legitimate merit, or should I just obtain the experience for free and skip on the accreditation aspect as anything less than a degree would be glossed over?

Hi all,

I figured to do this post after the first week on the job as an SRE straight out of school.  I hope this post can give me more insights from professionals in the SRE and more general CS field, and maybe provide some guidance and insights to other students and young professionals from comments that may emerge.  I post questions at the bottom if you don't want to read my intro.  

&amp;#x200B;
**Intro**
I got my CS degree in 2019, and started working July 8 at a security company as an SRE in production, responding to and fixing their cloud infrastructure.  I did not expect to be landed in this position, but they decided to hire some younger people since we do not have family obligations and can be on call through the night.  

I am eager to learn, but am very intimidated.  After the first week, I really saw what a production environment is like for the first time,  I have to use tech like Salt, RabbitMQ, Splunk, AWS, RHEL, Solr, Elastic Search, just to name a few of the many.  I am actually doing very little coding at all.  As mentioned, 6 days a month I am on call if there are any alerts, which is something I won't start doing until I get more experience.

I feel incredibly intimidated by the learning curve for me to even produce the smallest thing of value for my company and team, and am still getting used to navigating things like meetings, calls, people skills, and working in an extremely fast paced environment.

I am not sure if I want to be a SRE my whole life, I was simply offered a well paying job and I love Linux so I decided to give it a go!  Why not?  I will see where destiny takes me over the next 1-2 years (if I can keep up and learn this stuff that is).  

**TL;DR**: it is nothing like anything in school. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**
Some concrete questions I have that I hope might help me gain perspective and other students possibly reading this post:

\- People who are indeed SREs, how do you find yourself there and how have you found the field in general?

\- What are some ways that people have found helpful to adjust to becoming a computer science professional after being in college for four years, or, not working in the field at all prior?

\- Is it typical for a fresh college hire to be placed in production like I was with no experience?  I feel like a minnow in a sea of sharks.

\- Is SRE a good role for a general CS career, or does that push you in a direction that is hard to come back from?

\- What doors could being in a production environment like this straight out of college open (or close)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all who take the time to give some insight into the field for me and any new hires / prospective students who have apprehensions and want to learn more about the field in general!",17,37

I'm  currently working together with two other students on an university  project which features the creation of a dashboard for Microsoft's  Visual Studio. The goal of the dashboard is to gather information while  the user is coding and visualise their coding behaviour in an appealing  and helpful way. This would help developers to analyse their own working  behaviour and productivity. We want to evaluate if our ideas are indeed  helpful to our target group (professional software developers).

You  do not necessary need to know Visual Studio. It is sufficient that you  know equivalent integrated development environments (IDE) like Eclipse.

If  you are interested in our project, please fill out our survey which  introduces the project and asks you what you think about it. It would  really help us, if we know what other software developers think of our  ideas. Of course, you can also share your thoughts here on the post.  However, we would prefer if you could let us know about your opinion  through the survey because it makes the task of evaluating easier for  us. But feel free to discuss with other users.

Thank you very much!

Hi I'm currently doing electrical engineering and want to pick up a second major. my plan is to have data science as a career to fall on. What sounds better/what should I take.

Both the math and data science courses take all the statistics units, where we learn how to use matlab, r and spss.

The math unit has a unit on harder differential equations and numerical methods (partial differential equations which I e heard is useful in data science) also the math degree has a unit on optimisation and networks where we learn about dynamic programming and such. For some reason data science doesn't take this.

The data science unit has a unit on multivariate statistics and machine learning/ data visualisation which the math doesn't have?

As an engineer I will take all the calculus courses.

Which second major will be more beneficial? Thanks :))",2,1

236,2019-7-14,2019,7,14,6,ccunmh,Career Change -- Considering a CS degree as a second bachelor's -- hoping to stay client facing,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ccunmh/career_change_considering_a_cs_degree_as_a_second/,this-meme-is-a-lie,1563052825," 

I'll start with my TL;DR - I'm working as an account manager in health insurance, and I am considering advancing my education with a BS in Computer Science - Are there CS jobs out there that allow for people facing opportunities? If so, where should an online student look for jobs to get into these opportunties?

&amp;#x200B;

I studied Electrical Engineering originally in college, but once I got into my junior level classes, my GPA began to take a serious nose dive. I decided that I wanted to hurry up and graduate and chose a major in Communication so I could be done as I had kids on the way. After graduation, I worked in sales for different industries then went into Account Management in health insurance. As my career has progressed, I have found that I have missed the technical world. I still come home and tinker with my computer and occasionally code through [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com/), and I find that having people skills is fantastic, but coupling it with a technical degree would only help.

&amp;#x200B;

After some considerations, I have decided to go back to school online and after considering whether I should do an MS in Information Systems or a BS in Computer Science, I have elected to go the CS route online while I work full-time. My main concern is this: I have a lot of experience as a public speaker, and I feel that it is my strongest skill that I have. My main question here is: Are there CS jobs out there that require strong people skills, but still use the CS aspect? If so, is CS the best route for that or would it be better to go the IS route?

I've been working for a company in Canada that uses a fair number of third party contractors. 95% of those contractors are East Indian and living in Canada or still overseas in India and I have noticed they say ""codes"" instead of ""code"".

Examples:
1. ""I'm just reviewing the codes""
2. ""Can you send me the codes to do thing x""
3. ""I think my codes is broke""

It's not just that they are using it as a plural of ""code"", since, in my third example, it's used as a singular (""is broke"", not ""are broke"").

The reason I am thinking about this again is I just saw an IBM advertising their ""prebuilt codes"". I had always thought this was an East Indian thing up until I saw this advertisement. Wikipedia and other sources all seem to agree that it's ""computer code"", but I'm looking for other opinions.

Will I be competitive post-graduation? How valuable am I? I've got 4 internships on my resume and I'm currently co-founding a startup. Lots of projects on Github. I'm graduating with a bachelors in computer science and a bachelors in philosophy. 2.5 GPA currently, raising it over the next two semesters before graduation ( does it even matter? )

***Here's my big rambly post:***

Alright so I'm just trying to gauge my progress and value post graduation. I feel like I've done really well over the past two-ish years but sometimes I still feel like I don't know what I'm doing and that I'm so far behind.

Some of the other students I've worked with in some of the internships/startups/school projects have internships at Google, SquareSpace, Etsy, and some other big names. I feel like I'm at least in the ballpark of these fellow students, I think I know what I'm doing at least. I don't have any really big software/tech names though I do have a lot of experience in various other companies and in co-founding two startups.

Then on the other hand there are people in the program that don't have a single internship on their resume and pretty much have no real world experience. I don't get how they imagine they are going to competitive out of graduation.

The last internship I had ended right at the beginning of 2019. At that point I was super burnt out on programming and internships so I decided to take a break and focus on my classes for a semester. The biggest issue that's been at almost every internship/startup I've worked at is a lack of organization and direction. Two of my internships had my bouncing back and forth between multiple random projects and I never really got to finish anything. I learned a lot but it's just frustrating. 

**So here's my list / rough resume breakdown:**

I'll be graduating this spring semester ( May 2020 ) after 5 years with a bachelors in computer science and a bachelors in philosophy. 

My GPA is not great, it's 2.5. I'm planning on bringing it up over the next two semesters.

**I have 5 things I classify as work experience:**

**The first three are swe internships:**

The first one was at a small company. 3 people. Pretty much just me, my direct boss the CTO, and the CEO. It ended after about 4 months, pretty much a fall semester type deal. It ended because the CTO was putting the company ""on hold"" to pursue a masters.

The second one was at a larger research company. Thousands of people but I only worked with a few fellow interns, only one of which was also a CS major. I got it through the CEO of the first internship's company because I did some good work at the first one and came in clutch near a deadline and finished things up. This one also lasted 4 months and ended up being a spring semester. 

The third one was at a medium sized company, probably 100 people or so. It lasted about 7 months, through the summer and fall semester. 

**I've also been a co-founder of two startup companies:**

The first one was one I joined up on a few months after they had started. It focused on the creation of web apps for clients. I was one of the web developers. I sorta just list this one was an internship as well since it only lasted a few months before the company actually had to be put on hold because of poor project management and communication.

The second one I am actually currently working at. This one I've been at from the start and I think it's promising. However worst case it's just more experience and lessons about how things actually work in the real world.

**Besides that stuff my Github is full of personal projects:** I've got 45 repos of various kinds. Some are school projects and others are just websites I've made and other project ideas I've had. A few are just some documentation about a project I did just so I can go back a refer to it. Many are unfinished.

So yeah what's the verdict?",2,1

* What are the job prospects really like in the UK. From what I have researched, there is a high demand for computer scientists and the jobs are usually well paid without the hours being too long. Which is more than what I can say for my other options.
* Lastly, what about the risk of outsourcing and offshoring in the UK industry? Is it something I should be worried about? And what about robots? It may seem silly but please keep in mind I don't know anything about computer science.",5,2

You  are trying to build a wall. For each row of the wall you have a set of  bricks of the length 1 to N and you need to use every brick exactly  once. Now you try to build the highest possible wall for a given N  without any joint being on the same column.

[Wall N = 4](https://i.redd.it/6lpxvi727ca31.png)

My challenge for you is now to find a solution for the highest N possible.

The height each wall with a given N should reach is floor(N / 2) + 1.

For  reference my record is N = 275 with around 5 hours of computing time  (for N = 163 i need around 10 seconds) but i am sure you guys can do  much better then me.

I'm running small web-site with programming problems, which awards certificates for certain amount of efforts from users. They are free, but require significant number of problems to be solved. Generally speaking these certificates are just funny and useless things, but I found that sometimes people are quite zealous to get them.

**Recently surprising suggestion was posted at the forum there:**

* as there are less women than men among programmers in general (and in educational courses / colleges / sites too)
* as reaching certificate requires to solve many tasks (currently 145) which may take several months for beginner
* **so let's have additional version of certificates, which are awarded specifically for girls** on reaching some half-way mark to help them keeping motivation.

Idea sounds curious and is not hard to implement (say, setting threshold somewhere at 80 problems), but I'm not sure about how people may feel about it. That is the question of this post. It seems equally probable that some people may be pleased and some may be offended (even notwithstanding girls or guys).

*Of course we are not supposed to verify user's gender, so this should be just awarded on request. Supposedly if some guy wants to get the certificate ""for aspiring girl"" bearing his name, it is formally ok.*

In the scenario shown in the image, ideally what should happen is that I should identify the best path to travel is by getting on at As till Ae, thereafter get on to B edge and travel to Be as Be is the closest I can get to my destination which is Pe.
In summary goal is to find the path for Ps to Pe, via which Pe can be reached to exactly or nearest by. Currently I am using JraphT to construct the graph would like to know if this is at all possible or am i heading down a dead end.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am writing a thesis which deals with documentation comments (docstrings) in Python. The next step would be building a taxonomy for docstring contents. Even if there are guidelines for what should be contained in docstrings, theory and practice often differ.

In order to get a more qualitative taxonomy, I do not want to create the taxonomy by just referring to my own experience with docstrings, instead, I would like to see what experiences you made with documentation comments, by writing or also reading them.

I would be happy if you could take the time and provide an enumeration with general terms (like for example ""input parameter description"") of what the content of docstrings should contain in your opinion.",1,1

I've taken the first ""beginner"" class for the major and I'm not really sure it's for me. Like programming in itself isn't terrible but the constant stress of always being stuck while working on a project and frequent tests when I've barely understood the concept was a bit too much for me. The first class expected more of me then what I had and what they said they would need of me, and it moved too quickly for me to grasp concepts in time. 

Like I know this is just the start but it's only gonna get harder from here and knowing how I work, I don't know if I'm up for it? Tbh my career goal is to become an animator and doing this degree is mostly to placate my parents. They don't understand that there's barely any relation between the two and I don't need a comp sci degree for it. There's also the fact they want me to be ""secure"" once I'm out of college. My father argues that I'll get a better ""basic/core"" understanding of computers, but it's not really necessary for me and I don't like taking-in information I feel unnecessary, and I already have good computer literacy. From what I understand from the comp sci degree (at the University of Maryland-College Park) its mostly gonna be programming and theory. Even as a backup career I really don't want to be programming for a job.

I've already decided to double/minor in art, but I've been thinking about moving to Information Studies.

Oh, husbandsname, Im so glad to hear from you. Im working on some end-to-end encryption, but Ive got it all backwards. When Im sending, do I encrypt the message using the public ones or the private ones? 

Is this obvious or too difficult or completely wackadoo because I'm not understanding it? I will put the answer in comments. 

I can't change the answer itself because it opens a word lock, and word locks are pretty limited with what they can spell (also it has to do with the next clue) so I'm looking for help in framing the question in a way that's challenging but not obvious for someone who just got their degree.

however, lately im finding it difficult to balance between both. the lessons being taught to us and the material i'm self-studying are very different from each other, that lately i just find myself studying the material given to us at school despite liking the self-study book more because well, i care for my grade lol. i've never really had ""use"" of the knowledge i gained from the self study material in school yet, and while i do think in the long run it'd be really beneficial to learn all the stuff i can, right now, with tests and scores in mind i just cant find the motivation to keep on learning the self study material.

i know, i can just study my university's lessons, but i have a lot of problem with those. first, the lessons rely on so much precursor knowledge from past subjects that weren't elaborated well or even discussed by the other professors, and also, but i think this is mostly on me, i'm finding it really hard to pay attention in class especially considering the above. when i'm self studying i could just look up in google any term that i'm not familiar with, but in class i can't do that if i want to keep up with the rest of the class (since the teacher will go on with or without my attention)

Hello everyone,

We are a team of researchers from law, policy, and computer science. At the moment, we are studying the implications of the insertion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into society. An active discussion on what kinds of legal responsibility AI and robots should hold has started. However, this discussion so far largely involved researchers and policymakers and we want to understand the thoughts of the general population on the issue. Our legal system is created for the people and by the people, and without public consultation, the law could miss critical foresight.

In 2017, the European Parliament has proposed the adoption of electronic personhood ([http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0005\_EN.html?redirect](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0005_EN.html?redirect)).

*Creating a specific legal status for robots in the long run, so that at least the most sophisticated autonomous robots could be established as having the status of electronic persons responsible for making good any damage they may cause, and possibly applying electronic personality to cases where robots make autonomous decisions or otherwise interact with third parties independently;*

This proposal was quickly withdrawn after a backlash from the AI and robotics experts, who signed an open letter ([http://www.robotics-openletter.eu/](http://www.robotics-openletter.eu/)) against the idea. We are only in the advent of the discussion about this complicated problem we have in our future.

Some scholars argue that AI and robots are nothing more than mere devices built to complete tasks for humans and hence no moral consideration should be given to them. Some argue that robots and autonomous agents might become human liability shields. On the other side, some researchers believe that as we develop systems that are autonomous, have a sense of consciousness or any kind of free will, we have the obligation to give rights to these entities. 

In order to explore the general populations opinion on the issue, we are creating this thread. We are eager to know what you think about the issue. How should we treat AI and robots legally? If a robot is autonomous, should it be liable for its mistakes? What do you think the future has for humans and AI? **Should AI and robots have rights?** We hope you can help us understand what you think about the issue!

For some references on this topic, we will add some paper summaries, both supportive and against AI and robot legal personhood and rights, in the comment section below:

You can interpret this question how you want, because the main thing is to hear from other students/specialists/enthusiasts what made them think about CS: ""Oh, I think I finally understood what CS is all about!"".

My example:
For me it starts with information and how we want this information to be presented. We input something, then manipulate with the something and output something that hopefully is useful in some way using many different kinds of digital technologies. This thought is ""the essence"" for me.

To make students/enthusiasts less confused and stressed about the field, because lets be honest - even for the best specialists in the field there can be too much information to process in our short lifetime and even less time to actually understand CS to the degree of main philosophy of CS.",1,1

I will be attending college in the Fall. Ive always thought I was going to major in CS because I liked technology. It always started with that. Then a got to take a few technological related classes in high school. I also studied on my own for just a little bit. However, Im terrible at math and Im decent at programming (well I only have a experience with 1 language). I know math and coding are just two parts of computer science, but theyre huge parts nonetheless.

I pretty much consider myself an absolute beginner.  Im terrible at math and I know CS is a hard major in general and at my college I know its difficult. Im so behind in math I feel like. I want to major in CS, but now Im having second thoughts. Im willing to put in the work to study the math that I should know for college and work on my programming skills. But Im not sure if I have the time. Ill soon be in college and Im doing an academic pre-college program. Even in college Ill be too busy trying to do my assignments and understand them that I wont even have much time going over certain things. I really want to do CS. I have no idea what else I would do. I just dont know if I can handle it. I have multiple scholarships and shit that require me to reach a certain gpa. Im afraid Ill do bad in my programming and math classes and Im not sure if its worth risking.

In my experience most entry level (CS2) courses are taught in an OOP language like java or c++, and most students in these courses struggle with the concept of recursion. I believe that switching over to a hybrid language like Scala would give students a better understanding of recursive calls via the functional aspect of Scala (perhaps require students to do some labs only in a functional manner).

How is that working out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/cg4nbr/how_many_of_you_dont_necessarily_like_programming/,moonkie888,1563746160,"Well, I like a lot of people, am in the dilemma of deciding what I want to major in. Im entering my second year of college, and I honestly have zero clue what I want as a job or anything like that. I enjoy problem solving, and was at first pretty set on studying computer science, until I took my first programming class.

It wasnt necessarily disinterest that I had with the class, it was more the frustration of everything, deciding if I want to be at a computer for most of my time,  and realizing that Id have to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to learning. It also didnt help that this was a summer class, and the lecture was 3 and a half hours, and I think it couldve been any subject and I wouldve hated it anyways. It was summer, I was tired , and this was a morning class, that was fast paced, and I didnt even study for the first quiz so I failed it. 

I should also mention that I dropped the class within a week, bc I wasnt really up for the challenge of everything, it was really fast paced, and I probably wouldve given up and gotten a D in the class, had I not dropped it. It was about after 8 hours of material that I sat through, but I didnt pay attention to anything just bc I thought how it sucked to be here over summer while everybody else on Instagram seemed to be in Hawaii swimming with turtles and dolphins.

I ended up considering a bachelors in geology, and took a geology 100 course, and its easy, but I dont think Im into rocks like that. Plus, if you go to the geology career sub, its filled with people saying how theyre unemployed or how hard it is to find a job, complaining that their job is not what they thought it was going to be, and there seems to be a lot of people mentioning that the salary isnt that great.

And this got me thinking if maybe I should reconsider computer science. I mean I think its been mentioned on this sub how you only actually program for like less than half the time, and other time is spent with theory, discussion, and things of that nature. I wanted to do something with technology ever since I was kid, but maybe the whole summer class thing, was more based on outside factors than purely the material that was presented.

I also want to reconsider computer science because it seems like thats one of the most straightforward paths to financial/personal freedom. If I were to get a bachelors in geology, then theres no doubt Id maybe have to move to a cheaper area, or still live with my parents. I want to be independent as soon as possible, for multiple reasons, including having overbearing parents, wanting to have that independent experience while Im young (as I currently live, and commute to college from home), and I want to travel.

Having that independence is probably on the top of the list of my life goals, so Im willing to shift my mindset and give CS another shot, but Im just not sure of everything. Independence in every which way is really important to me, and perhaps the job prospects of CS, could give me that.

With  all that being said, how logical is my whole idea, if I were to take computer science seriously as more of a job or what it could offer me, rather than as something Im passionate about or care? Has anybody else been in similar position? Any advice would be appreciated.",7,1

I'm pretty sure its not power surges and I've disconnected and reconnected the cables.

If it becomes too much, I turn off the monitor for a minute and turn it back on then it works fine for 20 minutes or so and then the off/on drama starts all over again.

No money to buy a new monitor and I love this one, please help.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working on building my own little server out of my old Desktop PC (Intel i7 4790, 16 GB RAM GTX 970, if anyone is wondering).

&amp;#x200B;

My aim is to build a little server on which I can run a Web-Server, File-Server with three 1TB-HDDs in RAID-2 configuration and maybe some other stuff I'd like to try. It is not supposed to be a perfectly functioning provider, but rather a little experiment/exercise and maybe, if I can get it running somewhat smoothly, also for my personal use (data storage, applications, etc.). I'll be running it on Ubuntu Desktop version, because I have little to no experience with Linux and since performance isn't much of an issue, it will make everything much easier for me. (I might switch to the server edition at some later point, when I have more experience)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a lot of experience with server architecture and maintenance (which is why I want to try it), so I'm also looking for some advice from more experienced members of this sub: Which software to run, what to look out for, how to implement some of my ideas, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my more urgent questions:

&amp;#x200B;

* Since the hardware is not really meant to be run 24/7, I'm a little concerned about the durability impact on my components (which are 2 - 5 years old). Should I implement an automatic shutdown for a few hours a day/week?
* Can someone recommend some good books/videos on the subject?
* Can I run all of my software (web- server/FTP-server/whatever else I try to do) concurrently or will this cause issues? Can I somehow connect those services? (i.e: interface my FTP with my website on the server)

I come from a BA (English/literature) background; so 2yrs ago I had done zero coding whatsoever. After leaving the navy, I studied for the GMAT, taught myself as much python as I could pickup, applied my GI Bill to a business analytics MS program in Chicago, and am currently working as a data science summer intern (most of my assignments are very NLP focused, which interests me a good deal.)

I'm finding that my program is \~80% statistics and 20% CS. (Again) I'm very interested in NLP and want to continue learning skills in that domain beyond my MSBA program. I still have 2yrs worth of paid education via the GI bill, so I've been scoping out CS MS programs. But I've quickly learned that I don't meet minimum pre-reqs. Ergo, I'm now considering redoing my bachelors in CS. 

I'd like some feedback from the community if this is a reasonable goal, unnecessary, etc... 

A big factor is - will I be able to complete in 2yrs given full time study (and no need for gen ed classes)? My math level is business calculus, linear algebra, and \~4 statistical programming courses. I only have python experience. Should I teach myself java, c++, etc to see if this is really the right move for me?

I'm basically teaching myself programming over the summer and became good with flowcharts and pseudocodes.

So recently I designed a program through flowcharts that will check if any available spot opens up in my University's course and alerts me if it does so.

So I have my flowchart ready, the only problem is how do I make this program? What language should I use (I'm thinking python but I dont know). Also, how do I get an input from a website that is online? 

For information, my uni has a website that shows which course is full or open. So I was thinking that the program will have a variable and it will store a string (""full"" if course is full, or ""open"" if course is open). The variable will store a new string every 15 seconds (to prevent the University's system from detecting a bot).

Once the variable becomes ""open"" it will alert me by playing a mp3 alarm sound.

Topics to be covered include basic UNIX/Linux commands, text editing, files and directories, electronic mail, pipes and filters, and shell programming.

&gt;Required Materials: Sobell, Mark. A Practical Guide to Linux. Prentice Hall, 2014.

&gt;* Students will use UNIX editors to create and modify files.
* Students will modify, move, and rename files and directories.
* Students will use UNIX email and file transfer commands.

&gt;1. Create documents using vi or emacs editor
2. Create UNIX files and use file utilities to manipulate the files.
3. Use sed, awk, and Perl to process UNIX files.

Membership-Inference is the act of determining whether a given piece of data was used in a models training set, usually done by some attack model which is trained to find the differences between data a ML model has trained on, and one it has not trained on.  

The classic example is this: You have some ML model which takes some data about a person, and determines if it is likely that they have some disease. It is trained on some set labeled set of data based on a population. Using membership inference, an attacker could feed in some data and possibly determine if that data belonged to the training dataset, and therefore know that that person has that disease. However what I don't get is how knowing that this data belonged to the training set is anymore a privacy breach than taking someones data (who wasn't in the training set), feeding it in and it spitting out a prediction of the disease. What does it matter if the data was a part of the training set?",0,1

I have a continuous stream of messages with each message containing a monotonically increasing sequence number (which can wrap, but that's a trivial border case that can be dealt with separately).  The messages come over what is potentially a lossy channel and I want to detect loss (and count number of messages lost).  I do not care about retransmission/recovery of lost messages, just want to count them.

The application is multi-threaded for scalability reasons (think millions of messages per second) and I have no control over the delivery of messages to the respective threads (hardware controls that and cannot be altered - it's actually hash-based, not round-robin).

Obviously, if we have just 1 worker thread, we can just look at the sequence numbers as they arrive and trivially know how many messages have been lost.

Likewise, if we introduce locking between the threads, we can quickly design a resolution...but I want to avoid introducing locking between the receiving threads (there is no other reason to have locking as the messages are all independent of each other, so introducing locking will kill performance).

I've considered forwarding all of the sequence numbers from the respective threads to one centralized thread that can do the resolution over a sliding window (this is currently the best approach that I've been able to come up with).  Looking for possible other approaches to the problem...thoughts?",6,1

C#,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/cittjj/im_about_to_build_a_multithreaded_lexer_and/,CARVER-D12,1564305556,"I am building a language out of boredom and to learn about compilers, interpreters, etc. In a normal compiler we have several phases, phase one could be the preprocessor with removes  # as well for comments. Next we have the lexer, for lexical analysis, which reads character by character to find lexemes which then get turned into tokens for the parser, the next phase would be the parser, which takes in and asks for tokens using patterns to see if the syntax is correct or not while building a parse/syntax tree as well, etc.

I was thinking about maybe trying to experiment with performance for large source files. I was thinking about adding a preprocessor, but instead of just removing comments Ill leave it to the lexer. My preprocessor would scan the source file breaking up the code into several blocks, which then get turned into objects and added to some type of collection. Then, when done, my lexer will create threads for each block object, or create a thread pool, so each block gets analyzed at the same time creating tokens specifically for that block. That blocks tokens gets added to its own collection, we will call this a tokenlist. Then, the parser will create threads the same as the lexer, but will process each token list, appending its data to a single map before the thread has finished. All threads will write to this single map.

By design, would this be good? Is this something I should experiment with? My lexer and parser are already pretty damn fast, I wrote an algorithm that doesnt require regular expressions so my lexer can create 80,000+ tokens in about 5ms on a shitty laptop. No where in my project do I use regex. I just want to squeeze as much performance out of this as possible for large source files. And if I ever decide I want to create an editor with syntax highlighting, I need to be able to lex and parse quickly to feed the highlighter with tokens.",1,3

* After publishing new review of existing place or review of new one, all users will have their Database with places updated.

First and foremost I am not asking anyone to write or construct the essay for me.

I'm a first year comp sci student and part of my first assignment is to write an essay on how 'free software does not benefit freedom of expression'. Seeing as though I live in Australia I thought it wise to define 'freedom of expression' as our law does.

'Freedom of opinion and expression is the right to hold opinions without interference, and cannot be subject to any exception or restriction.'

It goes on to talk about the mediums it applies to, which is basically any medium, and how there are actually limitations of the right, for example intentionally inciting violence, and some 'artistic' material.

I can think of few reasons as to why free software (libre not gratis) could be a negative but all of them come from a business perspective, and have nothing to do with freedom of expression. Are there any more educated fellows here who can perhaps give their insights on the topic?",4,0

Today I decided to get start picking up programming languages I haven't used for a while now. The reason is because I got a job where I learned a new programming language and use 3 that I already knew. I learned Clojure and I use java, JavaScript, and SQL. Anyway, back in college I used C,  C++,  Java, and Python. During my free time a while back, I used to write small house projects for fun with the languages I mentioned before. However, after a year developing in Clojure, JavaScript, little to nothing with java (Clojure interoperability with Java), and SQL my other programming languages have become super rusty with dust all over and spider webs. I want to pick them back up. I started going into leetcode.com to have an interactive learning challenges. However, I keep Googling simple stuff I used to know by memory. I currently do not use Google for Clojure but for when I have to use a Java class in Clojure. I used to be like I am with Clojure with C, C++, and Python. Maybe, read the API or so. 

How do should I pick them back up again? 
Where do I start? I can define variables, structs, several data structures and so on.
Is reading a book on the programming languages I mentioned would help me out or should I pick back up my college notes?
What you all think is tbe best?

Thank you.",1,1

If I get a monitor and keyboard, hook it up to the computer, will the Hz go up? 

As an example,  if I buy a 144hz monitor and hook it up to the laptop that only have 59hz, The monitor will display in 144hz, right?

At work, I was handed over a couple Jupyter Notebook files, in which a MongoDB is queried via pyMongo and the results are graphed using Pandas/Matplotlib. I wrote a couple more queries that the team needed, but now I am trying to display the content of these queries onto a front end. These jupyter notebook files usually have the user enter some information (via input()), and the query then runs using the user input. I have experience making web apps (mostly VueJS) and deploying them onto the cloud, but I have never done anything with python for web apps. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some light snooping around the internet, it seems that there is no easy way to display interactive jupyter notebooks (where you can run cells) in a webapp (though I would love to be proven wrong). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any recommendation on how I would go about achieving the same functionality (where the user is able to enter certain parameters for the search queries, then is able to see the query results displayed in graph form) in a web app? Should I be looking into Flask, django or some other web frameworks? Essentially, we want to be able to give non-tech business management the ability to run these queries from a front end without having to install jupyter notebook.",2,1
