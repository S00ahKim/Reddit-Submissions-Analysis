I have long considered pursuing an Economics degree, but now Im in a position where an Information Technology major seems to be my only option. By the end of this Fall I plan to have my AA, but after that I dont know what I want to do. I have been telling my parents that I am planning to pursue an IT degree. However, I looked at the job prospects and the only thing available is Help Desk. I hate that. I have worked in a customer service oriented job for nearly 5 years. I hate talking, helping, or explaining anything mundane to people I dont know. After 5 years of retail, which seems to be an extremely similar scenario when compared to a Help Desk job, this fact is the only thing I know for sure: I hate any work environment representing a customer service job. I have the skills to fake laugh and smile when I talk, and listen and nod, but I hate every second I have to do it. 


As for my affinity with anything related to computers, I have none. I dont know anything about coding or any remote idea of how computers work. I dont even understand what Linux or UNIX even is or means. I also suck at math (I failed PreCal twice) and am a very forgetful and disorganized person. I have a curiosity as to how technology and computers work, but Im not 100% faithful to it. I dont tinker with functions on my computer or creatively try to solve problems or whatever. Im just a guy whos trying to get a job that I mildly enjoy and pays well. 


I have gone to CodeAcademy and done some coding just to see what the hell it even was. I dont know if I exactly like it or not, because I simply dont understand enough about it to make a conclusion. Im not exactly averse to the process of coding, but Im not completely invested in the thought of doing it all day either. Like I said, I have no idea which languages are for what. 


I am always researching what it is I can do with an IT or Computer Science degree, and what traits a person should have if they want to pursue such a degree. It just doesnt seem like I fit the bill, since most articles say You should enjoy problem solving, like Calculous, and be a creative thinker, like an artist. Now, I dont know about you guys, but I have no idea why the fuck people think every average soul is the beta version of Picasso and Einstein wrapped up in a little gift basket, ready to be sent out to binary fairy land. I can honestly tell you Im not someone who would be critical to world of technology. I am just trying to justify spending thousands of dollars on a degree. I would really like to not hate the work I do after that degree. 


After that rant, I guess my question really stems from the situation Im stuck in at the moment. I have the choice of possibly (Im not quite sure, since it depends on what my GPA is this Fall) being accepted into the Economics major at a great university, but whose Economics program isnt very good. Or, I could go to a much lower ranked university whose IT and Computer Science programs are the best in the state. My feelings toward Economics are nearly the same as with IT. I like the existential aesthetic of Economics (the study of our societys financial tendencies), but it is ultimately just as math oriented. Math is fine. I dont dislike it. Im just not one with the process of learning it.  


TL;DR (I guess?): Not sure if this is the right place to put this, but if anyone replies, Ill be glad. I would really like an opinion on my situation and if anyone has ever felt the same before they chose to pursue a degree in IT or Computer Science. If anyone who has struggled with problem solving, i.e. Calc. and such, but pushed through it to get a CS degree, then I would like to hear from those people as well. ",3,0

For background, I'm relatively new to computer science - I've been programming for a year or so and have taken a few classes (functional programming, ML, and computability theory). I have a job where I do a lot of functional programming, so I'm diving pretty deep on that. 

Topics I am interested in: 

1.      Web programming and web designing

2.      Mathematical foundations

3.      Algorithms and data structures

4.      Artificial intelligence

5.      Communication &amp; security

6.      Computer architecture

7.      Computer graphics

8.      Concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems

9.      Databases

I recently finished my graduate degree in architecture. My thesis involved a lot of programming and computational work and it's the type thing I want to focus on in my career. I do not intend to work as a software developer, but more on the research side of Architecture practice. 

My programming experience is restricted to using a couple of languages and understanding some data structures and design patterns, but I don't have anything beyond a superficial understanding of what the computer does behind the curtain. I don't know anything about the larger discipline of software architecture. I feel this knowledge would help me become a better architect.

I'll be teaching Intro, Intermediate, and AP Computer Science A courses next year at my high school. I've been teaching math for 5 years, from Algebra 1 to AP Calculus, and I'm excited for the change, but need some advice.

There hasn't been a good teacher here and there is no set curriculum other than the fact that AP CS A is programming with Java. I would like to have the Intro class be something accessible to all kinds of students, whether they're super interested in CS or not, but also be enough to prep them for the Java class. I'd like the Intermediate class to be more rigorous than Intro, but less rigorous and more well-rounded than AP in Java.

If you were me, how would you plan out the year for Intro and Intermediate?
Here are some ideas I've had:

-Intro starts with some web design via HTML, CSS, Javascript. It will get them used to text files becoming visual. They can make websites based off their interests. Not sure what follows.


-Intro starts with games and apps built in Scratch or Snap! This will allow kids to learn a lot of the structure of something like Java (variables, booleans, loops, etc.) without making any syntax errors. Not really sure what a good transition to text coding would be.


-Intermediate could be Python based, as it's simpler than Java, but what do the kids produce?

Any and all help and advice is appreciated. I know there is a lot more to computer science than just coding, but I'd like my courses to be prep for the AP in Java as well as giving the kids job skills and maybe a portfolio of work to take with them after they leave.

Thanks

Im still *very* new to discrete math, coding theory, etc, but I'm learning quickly.

---

I've been working on this problem for a long time, but I'm not sure exactly where to go from here. The problem seems to relate to error correcting within coding theory, but isnt exactly the same.

The original version of the problem came about a few years ago while driving at night and observing a large digital clock display in the distance. As I was observing, a building partially obstructed my view, making it unclear what the current value of the display really was. Knowing that there are a limited number of potential patterns for the digits of a clock (0-9), I wondered how many segments of the display (and which ones in particular) I would need to be able to observe in order to accurately identify the current time.

The problem can most easily be represented as a set of binary codes of a specified length, which is a subset of all the possible codes of the specified length.

My intent is to identify:

- The *number of bits* that must be observed
- All *combinations of bits* that might be observed to distinguish each valid pattern from all other valid patterns (any case where the bits between any two valid patterns varies, or the hamming distance)
- The *specific minimum bits* that must be observed to distinguish each valid pattern from all other valid patterns (and how to identify these specific bits)

So, given a set of binary codes of equal length, determine the number of bits to be observed in order to correctly identify all of the known codes. IE, observing 4 bits (D^0, D^1, D^3, and D^5) in the following example will distinguish the 3 codes from each other:

Bit Location|D^7|D^6|D^5|D^4|D^3|D^2|D^1|D^0
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Code 1|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|0
Code 2|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|0
Code 3|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|1

This method is basically just a matter of iterating between all combinations of pairs and finding the overall hamming distance (IE: 4). Unfortunately, this method only provides *a valid solution*. It does not necessarily provide *the most optimized solution(s)*, as demonstrated in this example:

Bit Location|D^3|D^2|D^1|D^0
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Code 1|1|0|0|0
Code 2|1|1|0|0
Code 3|0|1|0|0

In this example, hamming distance is 3 (correct?) (the left 3 bits), but in reality only the left 2 bits need to be observed to distinguish between the 4 codes. The fact that there is an additional bit change in D^0 of the fourth code does not add a requirement to check that bit.

Can anyone point me in the direction from here? Is there a name for this type of problem set?",11,7

I'm a recent high school graduate planning to major in computer science. I'm really curious about what it is like to major in computer science.

I am aware of the fact that computer science is not an easy major, and that it tends to be math-heavy. I have learnt Python for awhile, but I think that I am kinda slow when it comes to coding stuff. Right now I am learning Linux shell commands. How useful is Linux in computer science, and how is it used?

I might be misinformed on this one, but I heard that computer science students take tests with paper, not with computer. Do the tests involve questions where you have to write code from scratch and submit it on paper without (obviously) testing to see if there are any bugs?

How was your experience as a computer science student? 

How difficult was it, compared to other majors?

DId you have much free time, if at all?

When you had coding assignments, how tough were they in general? Was it like creating a battleship game from scratch within a week? (I might sound like a failure here, but creating games like battleship was kinda tough for me at first :( )

Thank you.

***My Profile***

I've done number of beginner online courses, read a few beginner books/documentation and am now pursuing a degree in CS so I'm reading DS/A textbooks.

In my spare time I'm learning to develop on Android, at my work I do some *very* basic data mining scripts in python in off time, and I've dabbled in some Rails for a webproject (no clue what was going on there), while playing with some C++ apps too.

Although I am exploring many different languages, personally I find I struggle a lot more than I think other's would with problems and learning APIs. 


***Question***

But how can does someone gauge whether they have enough proficiency to work in programming?

It is summer (obviously) and I am heading into my junior year of high school, a time most students begin stressing out over their future and careers (I started doing that a long time ago). I want to pursue a career in computer science and reach for a job in the video game industry. Maybe Ill change my mind about what Ill do with the degree in the future, we`ll see. Anyways, I digress... I need some advice and answers, hopefully one of you would be kind enough to help a kiddo out. :) 

1) After looking into getting a head start on this career path, one thing I saw suggested was taking an online course. [This one to be specific.](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science#introduction-to-computer-science) After setting up a github account (which I look forward to using in the future) I quickly realized the kind of time investment this would be. I saw that I could either audit the class, effectively taking the class for free without obtaining a certificate at the end of it, or pay for the class and get the certificate. My question(s) are as follows; Is taking a class like this worth my time? Should I simply pay for it to get this certificate? More importantly, what should I do **now** and through high school **before** I apply to and (hopefully) attend a college with a good comp sci program? **How can I get a head start?**

2) Can I obtain a position in the video game industry with a degree in this? Vague I know, but truth be told I`m not sure what position I would want. I kind of just have this fantasy of being on a dev team, coming up with ideas and making them reality. Sorry, that was too cheesy, I vomited a little.

Computers have always fascinated me, I built my own and I am extremely happy with it. If I never found my love for computers, I would not have ever had the pleasure of talking to you lovely people! As a young kid I may have more questions not too far in the future, fair warning haha.

To be more specific, I'm going to solve the water jug problem. You have N jugs (let's say N=3), 100ml, 250ml, and 500ml. You can fill any jug or empty any jug, solve such that you can get one jug to M volume. I'm going to BFS through all possibilities and prevent loops by caching states of the N jugs. Is this DP? Bottom-up?",13,13

In most C based languages, when you want a pointer to an object you use the &amp; symbol. For example:

    var x = &amp;Foo()  // x now holds a pointer to a new instance of Foo
    
If I now want to get the Foo object, and use it, I de-reference it with the * symbol.

    var z = *x  // z now represents the new Foo object itself.

However, if I want to declare a function that takes a pointer as a parameter, or returns a pointer, I use the * symbol to signify this.

    // A golang function that takes an int pointer
    // and a Foo pointer and returns a string pointer.
    func foo(x *int, y *Foo) *string {}

Why, if &amp; represents a pointer, and * represents the data behind a pointer, is * used to signify the type of a pointer?

Would love to know, thanks!",11,2

I don't feel a burning passion that everyone else feels. This is going to sound stupid but I thought since I have always liked to mess around with computers and liked puzzles that I would enjoy it. But let me also say that I haven't even really programmed anything. I've just messed around with html and that doesn't even count. I keep telling myself just to stick it out until I take my intro to computer science class and see how I feel after, but I worry I'll do terrible and hate it causing it to drop my gpa. Another reason I declared the major is for job reasons. Obviously if you're good at what you do as a programmer it seems that it isn't so hard to find a job that's secure and pays well. Because of this it has become another huge factor that's telling me to hang on to where I am at. But when I think to myself do I really want to hate my life for a secure job with a good salary? I'm on the fence and I really need help. Maybe I should Pursue my other areas of interest which includes business, accounting, finance, economics or medicine? I have also consider engineering but I'm uncertain about that as well. I try to look at each job as if I were doing them for free which would I enjoy for the rest of my life and that doesn't really work for me as money is a huge driver for me. I'm sorry that this is so long and I've began to ramble on but any help/advice you could lend to me would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!

I love games. If I could be a part of developing a game or just working in the game industry I would love it. I am just curious if anyone has ever had any experience with certificate programs or anything like this. Software Engineering sounds a lot more legit to me. I guess that's what I'm getting at.

There's certainly some aspects missing which I'd have liked such as Machine Learning and Computer Vision. The fact is for the point of cost I can't afford to go to a large city currently, so there's a trade-off for me in picking MSc Computing with very similar modules versus MSc Computer Science with a lot more  understanding in other areas.

That's why I'm here, I'm wondering what you all would consider is invaluable in your tool-belt in terms of reading lists.

I'd like to still push forward computer science with my computing masters I really love the subject matter and making the world a better place through computation.

I recently learned that the use of libraries for doing linear algebra, like for example a matrix multiplication, is much faster than the use of normal for loops.

Can anyone explain me how these libraries can do these things faster or show me where I can find more information on this.
