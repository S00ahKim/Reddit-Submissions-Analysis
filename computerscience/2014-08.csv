I heard CS is all theoretical and a lot of the actual programming is going to have to be learned outside of class. Is a CS degree worth it? I'm worried about the amount of math there is. Math has never been my strong subject. I am looking into this software engineering program, although it isn't really an engineering degree by any means. I'm worried getting a B.Computing degree for software engineering wouldn't be the smartest but I could be wrong. There is also a 5 year option to do co-op with this program. Any thoughts?

I need to find a college with a good CS program, but nothing to strict. I live in Southern Missouri, I was looking at Missouri State University,  but I don't think their CS program is exceptional. If anyone can help me find a perfect college for me, I'd really appreciate it... somethings to add:(sorry for poor formatting, on mobile and noob at reddit)
- I'd prefer to stay around Missouri or nearby states, but not an extreme priority.
- I have a 3.94 GPA (weighted)
- I took the pratice ACT and scored a 23, but my goal is 27-30 by senior year
- $15k/yr is probably the max I'd like to spend, although I know there's scholorship opportunities out there.

self-modifying code forever. First, it may yet be possible to come up with a programming language that allows for writing self-modifying code in a safe and easy-to-understand way. Second, now that automated reasoning systems are becoming more mature, it is worthwhile investigating the
possibility of letting the machineinstead of human programmersdo all the self-modifications based on automated reasoning about its own programming.

Concretely, I'm looking for examples that

- have an average or high complexity (too small examples wouldn't be that interesting for my purpose, too complex ones wouldn't help either),
- have none or only few dependencies to (proprietary) libraries / frameworks (unfortunately, our verification tool doesn't like external library functions very much at this time),
- use assertions to check meaningful properties at runtime,
- have a commandline-interface (i.e. no GUI-only)

It's all about the verification of real-world software - in this case, the automatic verification of assertions inside C code. Thus, I'd like to use such examples to evaluate my verification approach. Moreover, all results will be made public and will be free to use.

My problem is trying to figure out what path to take in terms of course selection.

I'll need to pick a concentration later on, though I'm a bit ahead of schedule so I could probably start taking the classes now. The concentrations range from the hardcore theory and math related ones like artificial intelligence and software engineering, to the less intensive ones (IMO) like internet applications and web design. Aside from the concentration, I'm also currently operating under the idea that I'm minoring in Math and Astronomy, but that may and will likely change.

See, I'm not really sure which path to take, and while these descriptions aren't accurate, I could go the software engineering route or the web design/development route. At least those are the paths that I think I'd be considering anyway.

The software engineering path would probably entail me taking the third calculus class (though it's not required) so that I could take more upper-level math classes and more difficult CS courses. This would very likely lead to me obtaining a minor in Math and also open the door to a minor in Cybersecurity.

The web design/development route, in my mind, is me taking the easiest courses, probably picking up a minor in Interactive Media and concentrating in internet applications, and simply getting the degree with little trouble so I can get out and do real work on my own. See, I'm a web developer intern right now and I love what I do. I love all the web technologies. But I guess I haven't been exposed to enough software engineering to know if I really love that. But then I'm wondering if I'm already overqualified for the Interactive Media minor since I've been doing web stuff for a while and I know my way around. That minor isn't strictly web based either - there's a video, sound, etc. component and I don't think I'm interested in that.

So I know it's probably very hard to give advice to me about this, since it's basically all up to me. I suppose simply writing it all down is helping me to think. I'm a strong student but I'm not sure if it's even worth it for me to go down the math/science/theory route if all I want is my degree so I can probably inevitably get a web development job anyway, though ideally I'd like to work with startups or start my own company. Any advice?

TL;DR already skilled yet love web development/design, should I go the math/science/theory route for software engineering, or stick to the web route and take easier classes and probably get a really good GPA even though I may be learning nothing new, at least with the first few classes involved?",2,7

I'm fairly new to reddit so this is my first post.  I have a few questions regarding cs as a major.  

1.  I'm going into my senior year in high school.  I have no real programming background to base my decision on but I've always been very tech savvy and skilled in math.  Will no previous knowledge have an adverse effect on me or not?  I've always been a quick learner with things new to me however.  

2.  I live in a small town in Iowa and would preferably like to stay in the state for college.  However I've seen a lot of talk about a BS in computer science but not as much as a BA in computer science.  I'm pretty sure the only school in this state that offers a BS in cs is Iowa State University.  All the other smaller and private schools only offer a BA in this field and are not widely known for this.  What is the main difference between the two and will the BS get me better jobs in the future or not?  I really liked ISU's campus but don't really know if I can handle the size.  I think a smaller private school would fit me better but don't know how their programs stack up.",6,2

I'm currently a first year CS (=""Informatik"") student in Germany. First year, as in ""I just finished the first year/2 semesters"". I'm currently doing good (not the best, but good nevertheless) and it's quite fun.
Although I'm thinking I'm lacking quite a bit of practical knowledge. As everyone told me, and as I expected, CS was rather mathematical. Not that I don't like the math, I just think *only* doing induction proofs on graphs and amortized analysis on different algorithms won't get me very far in terms of jobs.

I didn't know much programming when starting CS, so I didn't have the opportunity to do internships until now. Now I know quite a bit of Java (and a little less C) from university (and some x86 assembly and VHDL if that counts), also Objective-C which I have taught myself to write an iOS app (which I even published, but it's not that popular, it only has 700 downloads yet).
But no ""practical applications"" of Java, e.g. I have no idea how to make a website/GUI/etc. with it.

So before the 3rd semester starts, I'm looking for ideas what to spend my free time on, so that I could maybe do an internship in winter (after the 3rd semester is finished).
All of the job offers I'm looking at require either sysadmin skills (either in a Linux environment or Windows (Exchange, Activedirectory and whatnot) environment) or programming skills (often Java/C#/PHP, combined with HTML/CSS/JavaScript which I know next to nothing about).

Can anyone tell me how ""much"" experience you need to do an internship? It doesn't need to be at giants like Microsoft or Apple or Google of course, just me getting to apply something of what I learned.

So: How do I get proficient in Linux/Windows server administration tasks, how do I get more ""applied"" knowledge of programming, and how much knowledge is enough to apply for internships?

Thank you in advance!

PS: I'm hoping, the third semester is not already too late for that... (B.Sc. in CS is 6 semesters here)

Through out my development career, I've either been on a Mac (please dont start arguing about how its over priced) and/or Linux.


I know I can search and find my favorites. But Im asking you since I start development on Monday

If you were to do Java, C/C++ development on a Windows enviorment, what tools would you use? Any and all advise welcome!

Tell me all your windows tricks to make development easier on windows!!!!

I'm currently working on my resume and after spending a couple of hours, and having only a page worth of lines to show for it (a humorously familiar feeling in Computer Science), I've finally reached a point of near-completion. It's a great feeling but I am looking for help to make the final push. 

I'm doing my best to make my resume specific and unique to me so I stand out. Ideally, I'd put my special computer science interests and skills that show that I'm not just a code-monkey. But I'm coming up with a blank when I attempt to list my skills and specialties that aren't simply expected of any computer scientist. Why bother listing that I can apply my ""efficient coding"" skills? Or that I have ""knowledge of modularization""?

My only breakthrough is when I recently realized that I'm better at conceptualizing the problem solving and working with recursion. I was often the quicker one in my classes to wrap my head around the mental acrobatics that Computer Science algorithms can require. Is there better, less abstract way to articulate this in a resume that works for the Computer Science job market?

Can anybody shed some light on some words, concepts, skills or anything that might spark my memory of what I specialize in doing? I know there is something I'm missing but I'm drawing blanks now that I'm finally at this stage in my career.

I'm not actually a CS major, I'm an Information Assurance major (which can be an area of concentration for CS majors at my school) a lot of the basic framework for the degree is similar; we follow a core set of classes for all programs within the college of information science &amp; technology..

I was recently inducted into a program specifically for Information Assurance majors, it covers all the tuition for up to two years, pays a salary to go to school, has internship requirements and places me in a job for up to 2 years to repay their investment into my education. 

This is all fine and dandy, but, I took two courses over the summer to kickstart my program (Calc 1 and Advanced Java programming) and they both kicked my ass. Granted, Calculus was an online course and the Java course was condensed from 16 weeks to 6. Anyways, I lost all my financial aid and have to pay for the next two semesters out of pocket until I officially sign onto the scholarship program (you must graduate within two years of signing on, so, I delayed my entry)

My fear is that if I'm struggling with Calc and Programming then I will struggle even more with the more advanced classes. I wouldn't say that I dislike programming, I just have a hard time finding the fun in the assignments. They frustrate me to no end.

I've never been in such a low point in my life. 

Over the past few months, I have been searching through careers that I might find myself pursuing and CS has been near the top of that list every single time I work out a pros and cons list.

I fundamentally believe that CS is the degree of the future.

I've tried to study languages on my own,
HTML 
PHP 
Python 
C
Objective C 

but none of them I feel rather confident of.

It always boils down to two problems,

* 1) I lack experience. 
So many people that I know of who pursue CS all have prior experience doing projects. They know a multitude of languages, have excellent side projects and have some real world programming projects for companies. All this they accomplished without even starting their degree. 

But the thing is, every time I set my sights on starting a project. It gets derailed almost within the week either by 1) An immovable problem that I can't seem to solve or 2) I become too busy and the project gets shelved. By the time I get back to it , I'm back to square one because I've forgotten most of it.

* 2) I lack the mathematical foundation.
I've always been weak at math, and my constant avoidance and fear of it only exacerbated my weakness over time. I take the GCSE standard and although I managed an A* in it I have absolutely no experience beyond that. No calculus knowledge at all. 

This scares me the most because I know Computer Science is essentially a heavily modified mathematics major. I'm not sure whether I can cram all that math in the next year before I start a degree programme.

I was wondering if anyone could share any advice at all or whether anyone has been in a similar position as me?

In this (very loose) variation of the TSP, we aren't carrying all of our wares throughout our journey for free, and the goal is not even to visit all of the nodes. Rather, we want to find an *efficient* sub-route through a set of *market* nodes, each of which offers different rates for buying and selling. To help define what efficient means, we can consider that there is an additional cost (time) to traverse between nodes, and the ultimate problem statement has to do with discovering a path which produces the most wealth in a given duration, starting from a given node.

All together, our problem model includes the following components so far:

- The Trader, who starts in a given market node with a given amount of starter capital, and wants to optimize his earnings, ie. accrue as much wealth as possible, given a a fixed amount of time
- The market nodes, each of which have a list of goods for sale at a known cost, and a list of goods in demand with a known offer
- The edges between the markets have a cost associated with traversal, impacting the wealth of the traveling trader, but also have a time cost associated with them. These two distinct values could be considered linked unless there is use in modeling them uncoupled. Up for discussion.
- A path for our trader consists not only of a list of markets to visit in order, but also a list of goods to buy and sell at each market.

The problem is: find me the path for our trader that results in the most wealth accrued, given a fixed limit of x on time spent on travel.

I find this a very interesting human problem. Please help me better the model of it, formalize it, understand the performance constraints, generate an algorithm to get a solution or an approximation method, and have fun!",0,1

There is a big probability that Ill have to present a talk about the importance of Computer Science and Programming education in the modern world to a big audience of people that could have some impact in the matter at an European level.

I have a template of it done already, but I think that my opinion is just one among many. 

Thus, I thought that it would be interesting to gather ideas from people around Reddit. 

Why, in your opinion, is education in these subjects so important? ",2,6

I know I want to do Computer Science after completing several programming classes and projects. My guidance counselor has told me that my resume is superb already, and several more things will be added in the coming year. I've yet to take the ACT (I'm signed up to take it next month), but thanks to the PLAN test, I know I'm projected to make between a 31 and a 34.

So my question is, besides the big league schools (MIT, Carnegie-Mellon, etc.) what university is good with their CS program? I live in the Southeast so I have Vanderbilt and The University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana on my radar right now. But are there any I'm overlooking?

Feel free to suggest any university in America. And thank you so much for your time.",11,4

I am a system analyst / solution designer at a fortune 50 company. I am currently on an administration team for our data warehouse, which happens to be one of the largest in the country. 

I am currently attempting to piece together an architectural outline that would allow us to replace our change management and version control software with a much more stream lined process. I see the potential of using GIT with a series of other controls. 

I am fairly new to GIT and its possibilities. Hoping fellow Computer Scientists could offer suggestions, plugins, controls, examples, links to white papers, etc that could potentially help pull together a solution like this. ",2,1

Questions:

1. Exactly what do computer scientists study about?

2. In what type of environment is a computer scientist likely to work?

3. What type of clothing do computer scientists wear to work?

4. what type of gear and equipment will computer scientists use?

5.  How do computer scientists get into their field?

6.  (last question is my son's personal one)  Are you building a new computer or more trying to invent a new type of computer?
