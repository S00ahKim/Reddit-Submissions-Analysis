So I'm a sophomore at college student CS. And the problem is that now that I'm applying for Internships, well I am conscious that my resume is pretty weak. I don't mean this because of my GPA or anything but mainly because I haven't done projects. Yes, I did a class project for a freshmen class but that's pretty much it. I consider myself good at coding, I've been coding since High School and even thought I might not be a prodigy, I feel confident in my coding foundations. Establishing that, my question is that how do I make projects? Yes I know how to code, I know the theory and usage of the languages (JAVA mainly) but I honestly have no clue in how to implement it. I feel like I'm too late since I'm already a sophomore and I really have zero personal projects. As an example, I tried to get into Android Development but it felt too advanced. I'm studying to become a Software Engineer/Developer but I feel like I'm missing some important skills. What do you guys advice me to do, what are some good ways to get more into that field and how can I start practicing it. Thank you very much to whoever reads this and sorry for my bad English.",17,3

Been lurking here for a while now and I noticed how common being a skilled programmer is before starting college.

I am in my second year of college and have only taken a few CS courses so far, mostly OOP in Java, receiving all As or Bs. I've also started to introduce myself to new code outside of class as well as Github, but at this point still have only just tapped the surface of CS. 

Now for the question, knowing my experience so far and that I have about 2 and a half years left in college, am I too far behind to pursue a CS degree? It seems many going into school have already learned a language or two while in HS I concentrated mostly on my four year engineering program that I decided to not pursue as a career. Other than being an avid gamer and taking one community college class on OOP I went into college relatively new to CS. 

Another question, should I be self teaching as much as possible outside of class or focusing on my course material? 

One of the main reasons I ask is because many internships which I'm hoping to acquire soon look for those who know several languages already and I am no where near that yet. Any advice is very appreciated! ",3,9

I'm wondering if you guys/girls think I should change the program I'm studying at the moment.
Here is a glimpse of my story. So I started a civil engineering program with a major in IT 2013. I later realised I wanted to try and study something with more physics so started to study civil engineering with major aerospace technology with specific orientation towards spacecrafts and instrumentation 2014(Because I'm young and live in a country that don't have fee's for studying I thought of it as a good idea when I had time).  Now I'm on my second year and doubting my decision on the choice and maybe wanna go back to civil engineering with major Cs/It (at my university ). This because I feel like software development and constructing computer components is the thing I really feel passion for. 
Do you think I'm wasting my time or should I just continue on the path I'm on right now and try studying everything on my own on the sideline?  Cause kinda feel like when I'm studying even if it's hard work I wanna feel joy doing it and feel a huge intrest for what I'm doing and that I'm on my way of reaching my goals.",7,1

Although I go to a satellite campus, our core curriculum is still derived from the main campus. 

One thing I've noticed, in seeing students who transfer in, and also from instructors that transfer in, is there is obviously different approaches from different schools.

For instance, we aren't really taught to use libraries... like... at all. Aside from using some Java utility libraries, or C string.h libraries and such, it seems my school really, really honed in on the fundamentals of things. Everything command-line based. The result? I'm not familiar with a lot of the new libraries or technologies, or API's used in the industry, however, since I understand what is going on behind a lot of these, I can pick them up relatively easy. 

I've seen a lot of transfer students come in with some really impressive projects and things, but when I look at their code, I notice they simply implemented a library, or an API. Not to talk down on it, as in the industry you'd be wasting your time writing your own libraries and such, I just thought it was interested the approach some schools took, where some focus on demonstrating usage of industry technologies, and some took the stance of the science behind it all.",6,8

I have about 3.5 years of experience in the consulting industry and am trying to imagine what I should be expecting or working towards 5 or even 10 years from now.  So far I've mostly been programming and designing software.

The questions i'm asking myself are similar to: should I specialize in some subset of the industry ? Should I get my Masters? Should I try a product-based company?

I realize there are no clear cut paths or ladders to move up, but am hoping to get some input on what kind of work you do (preferably CS majors with many years of experience). Did you end up in a managerial position? Do you still write code as part of daily job? Is there a position or time where pay doesn't increase if you remain as a programmer? Do you like what you do know?

Any thoughts or advice would be helpful!",2,2

Critiques, please!!

A hallmark trait of any successful software engineer is the drive to self-learn. No successful programmer will be able to continually develop their craft if they are unable, or unwilling, to study topics on their own time. 
I graduated from Moravian College in 2012, with a Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience. Since graduating, I have studied an undergraduate degrees worth of computer science and programming courses.  Using open courseware, such as coursera.com, Udemy.com, MIT Open Courseware, and other credible online sources, I have built up my programming skills. I realize that not having a formal education may seem insufficient, but my drive and dedication to give myself an education should more than make up for the formalities of a brick-and-mortar institutional education. An online Masters program in computer science will more than understand that an online education can be comparable to an in-person education, especially if the student is driven, as I am.  
During the past two years, I have taught myself basic and advanced computer science concepts. Topics I studied include logic, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, databases, computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, software engineering, and software debugging. I taught myself to program in the following computer languages: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java. I also learned some SQL, both in-class and as part of a previous employment position. 
I have also completed an internship in software engineering, honing my programming skills and filling in any knowledge gaps I might have had. During the internship, I learned more about relational databases and SQL concepts, web development, and using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain a software company website. I also learned to work with a software development team and use Java to develop business software packages that were sold to clients. I believe that having completed this internship has given me an even stronger foundation to do well in this Masters program. 
During my career development, I have found myself being pulled in the direction of software engineering. The challenge and continual evolution of the field are exactly what draws me in. Knowing that there is always much to learn, and that there is no cap on the knowledge base, drives me to continue on in the field. 
In looking through the programs coursework, I recognize many topics that I have studied or have been exposed to. I do feel prepared to take on the challenge of this program, and hope that you will allow me to. Having a Masters degree in computer science will afford me the extended skills and credibility that will make me more marketable when I begin seeking programming employment positions.

Hello,
I am a 'sophomore' student, which I am putting in quotations because I honestly don't know what I am but I'll have ~60 credits by the end of next semester.


I was originally an IR Major but switched to CS after my 3rd semester of college. I transferred to a local college because that school didn't have a CS program (or a legit one at least). I just finished my intro CS classes so far and I think this major is very interesting and am pretty happy with my major change.


However, I am planning to transfer again for Fall 2016 and I've realized that pretty much all the schools I researched have their computer science students start taking major classes from year 1. So on top of my school right now being at a slower pace (local city school can't help it I guess) I would essentially have to start as a sophomore or in worst case scenarios, as a freshman again in pretty much all these schools.


The 100+200 level course here is equivalent to a 100 level intro CS course at most of the other schools which most (if not all?) freshmen take. Therefore I would only have 1 semester worth of CS major credits in those schools and I would essentially be a freshman or sophomore since I cannot take multiple level CS courses at the same time.


Ex. Year 1: CS 100/200, Year 2: CS 300/400 Year 3: More upper level courses/CS Electives 4: Same as Year 3.

This is the generic schedule I've generally seen from my research of transfer colleges so far.


**tl;dr**

So my question: Is this normal? I never knew I had to set myself so far back for a major switch. I would lose around 1-2 years from my graduation date if I was still an IR Major.


If not, what should I expect as a CS major transfer?


I will greatly appreciate any help from anyone who has went through this and has experience.


Thank you!


EDIT: For clarification, I would not be set back because of my lack of credits, many of my credits will fill gen eds and electives. However I have to finish the lower level CS courses first and they take at least 2 years.",9,2

I have the majority of gen ed and all electives complete, so it won't take all 4 yrs.

Now for the why... I love computers... I loved messing with them ever since the Commodore 64, and have built them since i486 DX architecture. (I also love a good old joke, so don't spare them) I enjoyed building my first webpage in Notepad when Netscape and IE were duking it out, when you had no software to help. I programmed crap in VB to mess with AOL and do some...stuff... Nothing more than skiddie level now, but it was bigger then. I worked as a network and systems admin for my high school while I was in high school... Hell, I designed their first webpage. Once I joined the military, though, most of that went by the wayside, and I've not been able to keep up. You may say rusty, I'd say almost rusted shut. 

When I retire, I don't want to stay in my current line of work. I enjoy the CS challenges I see when I research it, and I am very interested in the security and programming side. However, I'm also debating IT Management, since 20+ yrs of military would lend itself better to policy management, etc. of that field. Something about the problem solving side of CS really calls to me, though.

134,2015-12-31,2015,12,31,1,3ysu8c,Getting a Master's in CS with a Bachelor's in Econ,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/3ysu8c/getting_a_masters_in_cs_with_a_bachelors_in_econ/,penicillin23,1451494235,"I've been working in data analysis for a few years (I have a BS in Econ). I really enjoy the programming aspect of my work, and I'm pretty confident with Python, I'm learning Java, and I'm doing some independent studying in crypto and security. I'm now starting to consider grad school, but I'm concerned that my Econ degree doesn't cut it as far as prereq's go. I have decent marks in statistics, calc, and linear algebra, but no real CS classes except a freshmen level Intro to C I took on a whim my senior year.


Has anyone else made this sort of transition into the field? Should I try to pad my resume with a few undergrad CS classes from a local university? I'm sure it depends a lot on the universities I apply to, but for the most part, it seems that the equivalent of a minor in CS would cut it for all but the most competitive schools. 


I'm very serious about making this happen, I'm just not sure what my next steps should be. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",7,1
