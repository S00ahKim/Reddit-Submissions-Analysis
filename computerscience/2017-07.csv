I am currently at ETHZ doing a math masters in computational sciences. I have now experience in fields that touch computer science such as computer vision, machine learning, high performance computing (parallelizing, vectorizing).

I know most of the programming languages and have worked on different projects.

However I feel like I lack some essentials such as operating systems, networks, software engineering etc... And to apply for top jobs (there is google here in zurich) I should probably know more about ""core"" computer science.

30 credits computer science certificates exist. Do you think those are a good option ? Should I just learn those things on my own ? 

Any advice is welcome :)

I'm about to finish my studies and the upcoming graduation hit me hard with all sorts of fears. Thing is, I don't really like programming all that much :b In most cases it feels like a boring repetitive practice that has little room to creativity. I know it may not be a fair description but thats how I feel when I talk to people about subjects like Computer Vision or Machine learning. I'd honestly be happy if someone would refute all this, maybe it's just me.

As things stand Im considering to continue to masters in a theoretical subject but I feel employment options will be very limited after that. Any thoughts?

Been getting into the myriad of sorting algorithms out there, and there's something that's been bugging me.

MergeSort has a best, worst, and average case time complexity of _O(n) = n * log n_. Quicksort has a best case time complexity of _O(n) = n * log n_ as well, but a _worst case_ of _O(n) = n^2_. One would think that MergeSort is more efficient on average, going by this information. However, I've seen that QuickSort is used a lot more in practice. Why is that? What makes QuickSort more practical? Does it depend on the type of data being sorted, or even the data structure?",11,10

1. The selection is **stable**: there is no other book that they would both rather read than any of the three they have chosen.

I was thinking of going further with coding and going with CS, which my previous college (business school) didn't have, but my new, current college does. 
The thing is, I may graduate next summer with a CIS degree and if I switch to CS that will extend to the winter of 2019. 

So this begs the question: are there any coding jobs a CIS degree may entail? Which are the positions s I will pursue after graduation.

Is it possible in this universe?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6njllu/can_someone_with_my_background_get_into_a_csseng/,Ninjoa,1500168166,"Really, thanks so much in advance for any body that takes the time to read this as I am a little confused as to my prospects considering my unique situation and man are you guys helpful.

Talking mostly Canada here.

I'm a little bit of a mature student and Canadian citizen from Montreal (22 years old) who has completed Highschool, CEGEP, an ACS in Audio Technology (attestation of college studies here in quebec, a 7month tradey program) as well as a semester of Finance at Concordia's John Molson School of Business before unceremoniously dropping out at 19 after a family fall-out and getting of the house at the culmination of a substance abuse problem that had been increasing in intensity for 6 years (had been a user since 13) for which I later received government treatment (and have documentation to boot, to help explain the improper withdrawal) and am happily 3 years clean. My main worry and the what I think is the legitimate/ irreversible hit to my academic record - that while under special circumstances, I did not call and withdraw correctly before the course deadlines and have a DNA on my courses (did not attend) for that second semester. This however was three years ago. I don't have to mention the substance abuse to any university as a reason - I can keep it vague as impromptu health reasons, just being honest for you guys.

My high school overall average was 85%, and in the science/ engineering pre-req related courses that I took (Science &amp; Tech, Comp Sci, Mathematics), maybe languages (French &amp; English) my averages by Secondary V were respectively 85%, 81%, 78%, and 88% (91% in French and 84% in English). In CEGEP (2 Year Grade 12/ Pre-U Equiv School in Quebec) I received a grade of 80% in Calculus I (Grade 12 Mathematics Equivalent) and an overall average approaching just 80%. I had a 3.3 GPA in the semester I attended University. Yes, my grades were rather unimpressive and plebian.

After secondary four I averted the science pathway because I wanted an easy life and had no foresight - as such I am  am missing my Grade 12 Chemistry and Physics equivalents. I am taking them this Fall at a local college alongside a Calculus I retake, and will receive 85-90%+ averages, bringing my overall average in Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus I, (Grade 12 Chem, Phys, and Math equivalents) to approximately 88%. I will probably take further chemistry and physics courses (mechanics, EM, General Chem, which are above and beyond grade 12 courses and are actually university equivalents in the rest of Canada) in the spring to add more to my academic resume and averages.

At the time in CEGEP I wasn't focused on engineering, science, mathematics, computation, or the like - and pulled 69 (I know) in both linear and Cal II - which are of course not pre-requisites for either SENG, CS, or ENG at any Canadian university for undergrad programs but are actually first/ second year material. Never failed a course in my academic career. My focus at the time was unfortunately for me not mathematics - but it is now.

Detailed I know and thanks for reading - in summary my question is:

With these marks and my situation, is there any path possible for me, however time-consuming and long-winded to enter any of the Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Engineering programs across Canada? Is there still hope?

Realistically I am looking at an 85% overall average across CEGEP and Highschool, having previously taken cal 2 and linear before, and having an average of 86+ across chem, phys, sci, and cal I courses. Since I may only be able to apply next fall, i might do a spring semester again retaking those courses to boost them to 90+ and also taking a biology course to add to my academics.

I posted this in Eng too but I really want to thank this sub-reddit for giving me the confidence and information to even decide to re-educate and obtain a degree for a better future and life. I hope to one day post here as a student, and better yet, from the work force.

I know i stand no chance of ever entering uoft or waterloo just btw. Looking for reasonable/ realistic options",10,6

Right now my [working] process is. Take dictionary, build object of needed items from dictionary (where number needed = k; 1 &lt;=k&lt;= length(dictionary). Then I get a list of objects. The objects have a time_key on them which allows grouping of one object to the next. For now, I perform some actions (grouping on time_key similarities, combining other values in a coherent manner, and then manipulating the data in whatever manner I want.

Ultimately I'd like to make this as encapsulated as possible, most of the time is spent in retrieving the data from the stream, so multi-threading is an obvious improvement.

Hello /r/computerscience. Would like to invite you all to a **new EECS server** [ : EECS](https://discord.gg/GhDtTSZ) that we have just recently set up.
 
Let e get this out of the way: We are not a server about coding. It is primarily about Theoretical Computer Science but we also have channels devoted to Electrical/Computer Engineering and more applied CS.
 
Current channel list includes, but is not limited to: Abstraction(TCS), Algorithms and Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, Numerical Methods, Control Theory, Cryptography, Hardware Architectures, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics.
We also have a library of primer resources, such as books and lectures for every thematic channel.
 
Although we are a serious discussion server, but unlike other serious discord servers, we prefer to not to enforce very strict moderation. Since the server has been set up for Juniors/Seniors and Graduate students, we trust our users to act as adults, be nice and avoid bringing off-topic discussion into the thematic channels, which is why we allow a degree of informal behavior. Oh, we've also got cat emojis.
 
P.S.
We also have a sister server devoted to pure mathematics:

Sorry for this, but recently I've been having an internal crisis. I am in the summer after my freshman year, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and feel like I have no clue what I'm doing. So far I've taken a class in C++, and that's basically it. I'm also starting to work on a video game with my brother. Everything with the video game is pretty simplistic. We are using Unreal Engine, and are just diving in and learning how to use everything by following an online class (150 or so episodes). I should also state that I've always wanted to make video games, but it was always a pipe dream to me, until I switched out of Molecular Genetics after the first semester because I had friends that taught me the basics, and made me realize it's doable.

Recently I've been doing a lot of research into video game development and app development. I'm freaking out because I feel like I know absolutely nothing about what I'm reading. I understand that I'm new to this, and that maybe it should all sound like gibberish, but don't want to fall behind. 

My main question is, will I learn all of this stuff? Or is it just expected that I've been working with computers my whole life and that I should know it already? I now realize that all I know is basic C++, and an idea of object/class oriented programming. I love what I'm doing so far, as it simply seems like a giant puzzle that I solve by building more pieces. Everything is going well, but I don't want to end up in a class next semester and not had any idea what is going on. I am absolutely on board with doing my own research and self-teaching this stuff, but ran into the problem of not knowing anything when I started researching.

I am a recent graduate with a CS degree and have made it to the final round of interviews with a company. They are flying me down to their location to see their offices and have a day of interviews including two face to face technical interviews. 

The company focuses on embedded systems and I have had very limited exposure to them. The company is aware of this and has had no problem with it, but have hinted that I should try and learn the fundamentals in the next two weeks before the interview happens. They seem very supportive of mentoring and trying to teach new employees but I think this is probably somewhat of a test to see if I'm dedicated enough to try and learn it quickly. 

I have done some basic searching but I really am at a loss as to where I should start or even what kind of things to expect from this type of interview. 

If anyone here who is experienced in embedded systems would like to give me some tips or resources that could give me at least a basic and rough fundamental understanding that would be amazing!

I'm pretty tired of hearing about how easy it is to make amazing money through coding or IT work. 

I see things ALL THE TIME on reddit like ""I've got an interview with hello world and HTML under my belt."" ""I got hired with no experience or formal training and started at 70k a year."" I see things like this all the time, and...something seems totally off to me about the truthfulness of these statements. I do not think it is as easy as so many people make it out to be. 

Now, a few things here. Yes I understand that there is a huge demand and low supply of skill, and yes I understand how this drives wages up, gives more bargaining power to job seekers and less to hirers (after all, as opposed to comp sci, I chose to study economics). I understand this, yet, all I'm saying is I think that people often exaggerate just how easy it is to get into these positions and make great money, or develop the skill set necessary to get into such positions. 

This time next year I'll have a MA in Econ and hopefully will be able to land a good paying job. Likely the job will be using machine learning languages. Hopefully this works out, but what if it doesn't? With so much talk of automation etc .... I mean, if you're not writing the raw code, what the hell could you do for work 25 years down the line? I feel like I have to go into computer science.....just to get by...


So, what's the catch here? Why do people claim it's so easy??? It's hard as FUCK! 

Learning this shit is the most frustrating thing I've ever done, trying to tech myself this shit makes me want to kill people. There's no way I could develop the knowledge necessary to be a software engineer on my own. I need someone to teach me and there's a negative percent chance I'm forking over more cash for school. So considering all this I basically just feel totally lost with where my life is headed. 

Now, just for some perspective, I KNOW I am smart enough to do this type of wrk (albeit probably not patient enough), however I know I have the brain power. Not that this directly provides me with a bounty of softwRe knowledge, but both of my parents were software engineers until they retired. 

In addition to this, I've taken many math classes in order to get into grad school for Econ, and of the classes where I had many comp sci majors in there (like math proofs)....I was always in the 90th percentile in these classes. These were classes with a mixed bag of math majors, comp Sci, engineers, and randos like me....all I'm getting at here is my brain is highly capable of solving logical problems at the same level or even greater than many of my peers who have already entered these fields. 

After this extremely long winded post (and I do apologize I'm on mobile and basically just wanted to rant) here are the questions: 

Why do people claim it's so easy to get jobs in this field? Yes there may be a lot f jobs, but you can only do it if you have the skill.......so.....

Why do people claim it's so easy to teach yourself this stuff? How can one do this with such a steep learning curve? How do I even begin? Is it even possible?

My interest in computer science began pretty late (when I was 17). I started off with learning some basic Python by myself. I enjoyed it but didn't get very far due to being busy with other things. I also remember making my first ""big"" program in Visual Basic. I used to have a lot of fun learning these things.



I have just completed my first year in computer science. It has been a rollercoaster. Regardless of having high grades, I was incredibly behind with my technical knowledge compared to my peers. It was really intimidating for me, being the ""dumb"" one for once. And I guess in a way I shut down and started enjoying learning less because I felt like a ""failure"" and there was so much pressure to catch up. 


Eventually, I did catch up but that was more because I realised I was going to screw up my degree. I ended my first year with a 2:1 (second best grade) which I am super proud of. But at the same time, it sucks because I didn't enjoy learning due to the pressure of catching up.



Now this summer I had plans to start my own projects, learn C++ etc. Get ahead of my studies and start learning about graphics. But it's been 6 weeks and nothing has been done. Every time I try to work, I am faced with that same anxiety and that same fear of failing. I become overwhelmed as there so much to do. I am scared to mess around with code. To try something new. Whereas in the past, when I started python, my attitude was completely different - I actually enjoyed it.



So my question is, how can I enjoy learning again? I have the next 2 weeks completely free before I start my job, and I want to utilise it as much as possible.

This will be my second year, however, I will be formally admitted into my major once my summer class is credited to me.

As much as I have been trying to find information, I cannot find all of the sub-fields that CS has to offer. I have found threads on this sub, but it hasn't resolved my lack of information. Ideally, I would like to be well rounded in most areas when I graduate. I find the CS field to be very interesting, for more than just coding. While I know absolutely nothing about it, I love playing around with networks and the stuff that most people don't typically see. I find it very interesting to understand how all of it works. I hear about courses I will have to take and I have no idea what it is.

I feel lost in my major. I have messed around with code very little before college, but the first time I have actually done something with it was from my programming course. It feels like all of these other people as far into the degree as me are so much more capable. They understand a lot of the sub-fields whereas I can really only answer to two, they know more about programming whereas I only know very elementary C++. For example, I didn't even know what SQL was, I still don't really get it, but it feels like everyone else knows what they're doing.

I want to be able to code, develop software, work with security, work with networks, set up databases, understand and create algorithms, all of it, I just don't know how to focus on an area, let alone fully understand the areas so I can determine which I enjoy the most. I hope to be rounded in all of the areas because I am genuinely interested in all of it and I believe that is what will point me in the right direction, but by the time I get enough experience with all of it I feel that it will be too late to choose electives for which sub-field I want to verse myself in more of.

People recommend working on projects and finding internships. I couldn't find an internship this summer, nobody wants someone who can only code very basic C++ that will run on a console. As far as projects go, I don't know what I could possibly work on that could be used in resumes and such given how much knowledge I lack in this area as of now. People keep suggesting to learn code online in my free time, but I don't know what language to start with and I always eventually hit a road block early on that I can never figure out because the information is not as detailed as I need it to be, instead, when I get stuck on certain functions of the language, I get sent down this rabbit hole of information and all of it is overwhelming because I don't know the general information. I don't mean for it to sound like I cannot solve problems, what I mean is that I don't have all of the fundamental ideas, I still don't know what database structures are for example, so it complicates things when hitting those roadblocks.

I just need help, some advice to point me in the right direction. I need to know what to do or who to talk to because I want to become very skilled in this area. I am passionate about it because it interests me so much, I want to do the right things to benefit myself as much as possible. Thank you for the help.",7,26

It requires an investment in DevOps skills, practices and supporting technology to move analytics out of the lab and into the business.

DVC is an open source tool for data science projects. It makes your data science projects reproducible by automatically building data dependency graph (DAG). Your code and the dependencies shared by Git, and data    through cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP) in a single DVC environment. It clearly helps to manage a big fraction of DevOps issues in daily data scientist routines:

1. Pull all kinds of necessary data from a variety of sources.

2. Extract, transform, and load the data.

3. Facilitate continuous machine learning and decision-making.

4. Share your algorithms and data.

Another DVC feature is ability to support multiple technology stacks. Whether you prefer R or Python-based implementations for industrial data products, DVC will be able to support the pipeline properly.

*Finished few courses and almost finished MITx600.1x Intro to CS at edx. How can a beginner improve now if he gets stuck with a few exercises at codewars and learning a new library/framework  *

&amp;nbsp;

I would like to apologise in advance if this is not the best place to ask this question. 

I've been learning about Python for a few months now. I've bought a lot of courses on stackskills and I'm waiting for the final exam of MITx600.1x in edx.org. I was feeling pretty good since my little knowledge of Python syntax allowed me to solve problems and make working scripts.


I've found codewars and started working on some of the Katas/challenges, this helped me a bunch because it shown which areas I truly know and which ones I need to study more (OOP being one of my biggest downfalls). Along with that I have been reading on algorithms (bought the CLRS book), brushing on my math skills in khan academy, trying to learn discrete maths (bought Rosen's book) and finally I'm doing some light reading about OS with the book(modern operating systems 4th ed). I've been busy, but my work allows me to have plenty of time off.

&amp;nbsp;

Today I got stuck on one exercise at codewars. After trying for a few hours I got frustrated and took a break. When I came back I decided to do one of my stackskills courses (pyQT module). I tried to create a calculator using pyQT but after being stuck on how to do it and browsing google to try and figure out how to work with pyQT I was able to make a layout and that's it.

On these tutorials that I follow and watch, the other person seems to know pretty much everything there is to know about what they are teaching. I see how they quickly spot a mistake and correct the issue (some after an attempt at running a program fails). As a beginner, it amazes me how proficient with Python or the library we are using.

I understand that there will always this moment of frustration. Maybe we are a bit too tired or just not focus enough on making our brain work. But how can a beginner like me jumpstart my learning (I'm not hoping for a miracle 2-week crash course thing, I know it takes time and lots of practice).


I came across this post https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard and made me realise that most people seem to go through this 'at-loss-phase'. But how do you get out of it? Do you just suck it up and keep struggling until you get enough experience that everything makes sense?

&amp;nbsp;

**Future Plans:** I would like to eventually go to uni and take a CS degree (I already have a BS degree in tourism, but I'm 29 and I want to do something that I truly love and challenges me every day). Living in the UK, uni is quite expensive so I'm trying to learn as much as possible before applying or start making amazing apps that could land me a job (a guy can dream right?)

The day before classes start I will be turning 30 years old and will have been out of school for the past 13 years. After I graduated highschool I roamed quite a bit and went through many drastic changes in life. I lived hard. But now here I am, inspired to return to school due to a deep yearning to leave a legacy behind beyond manual labor, an empty wallet and a plywood casket. Before signing up for classes I sat and thought for a long while about what is it that I would actually want to DO though? I settled on Computer Science because I have always loved math, I'm good at it and I've always wanted to learn how to program. So this Summer leading up to the start of term I have been studying, refreshing myself on all your basic algebra and calculus, learning the basics of html/css and javascript, dabbling in python, but I'm still worried that I'm going into this completely unprepared. I never took my SAT's so I had to take an entrance/placement exam which luckily I passed with high enough marks to actually qualify for the CompSci program. Admittedly, it's a community college, but it's honestly more than I ever thought I'd do before now. So really, my question, what I am wondering is what can I expect going into Computer Science as a freshman with only minimal programming knowledge? My course-load at the moment consists of CompSci I, Discrete Mathematics, Calculus and English 101. What more should I prepare myself for in this next month leading up to the first day of class? I just started a free MIT CompSci course in hopes of really preparing myself for what is to come. I really want to succeed here. I didn't have the patience and drive for this when I was younger, but I want it more than anything now and I want to excel as much as I am capable. So I am reaching out to people with far more knowledge and experience than myself and asking you, what should I focus on right now?

You go to the first cell in the next row if you reached the last cell in the previous row. i.e., as if the first cell were one cell to the right of the last cell in a row. 

And if you reach the last row, you'll go back to the first row, one cell to the right from your current position. 


Four operations are allowed:

0 0 : You inform that a dot is present at your current position. You can inform about a dot only once: if you have already informed about a dot, just say there's not a dot at your current position. 

1 0 : Instead of going one cell to the right compared to the previous row, you go two cells to the right compared to the previous row. 

0 1 : You inform that a dot is not present at your current position. 

1 1 : You inform that a dot is not present at your current position. Instead of going one cell to the right compared to the previous row, you go two cells to the right compared to the previous row.  


What is the name of the computational problem I'm dealing with here? 

What is the best algorithm to inform about the position of all dots in the least amount of steps, if I will always start from the first cell in the first row? 

I guess this needs a graphical example. For instance, you have this matrix with some dots, and you have to inform about the position of all of them:

[Matrix with dots][1]

[Possible solution ( not sure if the shortest one ) ][2]

Edit: I know where the dots are, I don't have to iterate over the list for that. And: I know how to solve this by brute force, but I need to discover the shortest path. ",8,6

I am an incoming freshmen who currently has a strong passion to become a Computer Scientist. I took my introductory CS 101 course at my local community college for dual enrollment credit in high school and my university accepts that course for my CS 1114 class. The only problem is that the CS 101 class was in Python, and the CS 1114 class is in Java. I have been hitting Java pretty hard for the past week, and plan on continuing to learn the language to be ready for college. Should I continue learning and skip the CS 1114 class to go directly to Sophomore CS, or should I take the CS 1114 class even though I have credit for it? My academic adviser was split down the middle and gave me a bullshit ""Do what you think is right"" answer and the university subreddit was similarly split down the middle. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!

Thank you! ",7,6

That being said, I'm not entirely sure where to start. My high school didn't offer many programming classes, and the ones they did offer were taught by teachers that didn't know much more than I did. I delved into Java, HTML, and a bit of VB, but didn't learn much in any of the 3 courses. My question is, what might the learning path be for an incoming CS major wanting to learn code? Also, if there are any important things you think someone wishing to go into the field and complete their B.S. should know, please give any and all advice you have! I really enjoyed Cyber Security in high school but again I learned mostly everything on my own as my teacher was a business major and I basically taught the class with knowledge attained online. 

TL;DR: Looking for important things to learn/do before and during the completion of a B.S. degree in CS. 


EDIT: Also, are there certifications I should be working on? I'm interested in software engineering/cyber security. I'm not decided on which and I have the CompTIA IT fundamentals certification(although i understand that's nothing) only because we took it in high school).",12,13

I had a question concerning the path I want to take as an incoming college freshman. My goal after college is to become a software engineer and I am going to enter college in the fall. Im currently enrolled in a Bachelors of science program in Computer Programming and Information Systems. [Here](http://www.farmingdale.edu/academics/curriculum/bs-computer-programming-and-information-systems.shtml) is the information on the program along with its curriculum to the side. They dont offer a computer science nor a software engineering major at this college. So this is where my question comes in. Could I still become a Software Engineer with a bachelors degree in this program? Are there any courses I should take as electives that are essential to me becoming a software engineer? Should I take an applied mathematics minor to complement this program (Calc I, II, III, linear algebra, differential equations, and discrete mathematics)? Would it be better to transfer to another school with a computer science degree if this program cant lead me to a career as a software engineer? And finally, could I still become a software engineer if I graduate with a bachelors in this program and later get a masters degree in software engineering? I would appreciate any response that could provide me with the most information to my situation.",5,2

To prepare for this, I learned basics of each language during the summer but find myself in the same conundrum of mixing up small things, which forces me to google solutions, or open up old code, resulting in a ""I'm stupid"" moment. I used jGrasp for most coding, since I figured it would help me to become more self-reliant.

So here's the question, how do so many developers know so many languages and don't google things all the time? Or do you secretly have files to reference? How do you balance knowing so many languages?

Unrelated question: What languages did you discover you needed to know? Because, if I'm going through this trouble, I might as well add on other useful ones.",9,15

Since most of them are doctors, they think being a doctor gives me a better life, but that's not what I want, see?

I try to convince them that CS degree can get me a job easily, so I need some evidence and the perspective of people of actually majored in CS.

A little background story: I'm going to be a Junior later this year in High School, and I'm convinced that CS is something I love to do, and hate everything that has to do with being a doctor. I'm just concerned that by the time I get my CS degree jobs are already being taken and a lot of people have already graduated with a CS degree.

I'm hoping that CS is still viable and jobs are opened by the time I graduate with a CS degree, and that's gonna probably take... About 6-8 years maybe (6 years for a bachelor's and 8 with a master's).

Hey everyone, I used the above algorithm in a course project and wanted to know if it has a name. To the best of my knowledge it looks like A* or Dijkstra's but I know very little about algorithms. I'm putting the project on my resume and wanted it to sound as impressive as possible.
