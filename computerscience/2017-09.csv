I'm pursuing a degree because like I said this is a career switch for me and I feel like a lack of a degree in general has held me back. I'm thinking that majoring in software development is best because it's a specialization and coding is something I wanted to learn for a while now.

Sci Club?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6xmotq/ideas_for_a_community_college_comp_sci_club/,00kiwieyes,1504366450,"Hi, I'm starting a CS club next month at my CC. There was an App Makers Club last year for one semester, but it was pretty dead after the first day and National Day of Code (which had food), no one got to make any apps besides tutorials. They were using MIT App Inventor. I want to avoid what happened to them entirely. 


I'd like suggestions from this sub to see if anyone has any ideas. My club will be called the Comp. Sci Crew. So far from what I can remember:

* Food. Everyday. Probably snacks/junk food.
* Bake sales for the club and/or Girls Who Code or some other STEM group/charity we can donate to.
* Offering to volunteer to help with or teach coding in high schools, companies, small events. Idk if this one can be possible
* Offering to code websites for other clubs
* Custom T-shirts
* Hackathons and attending hackathons in the city on weekends, we could carpool
* Letting the club work in groups - those who want to work on websites, those who want to work on apps, those who want to follow a class and learn, etc.
* Speaking of following a class, I was thinking the club as a whole could follow Harvard's CS50 or some other online class. We could show off our creations from the class or from our spare time every club meeting
* Posters, decorations around the room. Plenty of emails letting the school know the club exists
* A weekly coding challenge and handing off bonus prizes for those who actually did them
* Maybe a daily did-you-know, programming facts, definitions written on the whiteboard. CS news that just happened today and a CS related doodle too. 
* Research, we can all ask people questions for a survey and read articles. The previous Women in CS's club did it and presented at a summit and I figured, why not do it too? What they did was basically a Why Aren't There More Women in STEM presentation which I thought was simple enough. I'm not going to do the same thing though.
* Google Hangouts! Asking people on Facebook groups and maybe even Reddit if they want to do a live video FAQ or perhaps a talk on their careers/college so far so people can get an idea what they want to specialize in, what CS is like, etc.
* Maybe fun extra events like giveaways, karaoke, idk, just to bond as a club.
* I've already made a website for the club. So far I've got a Intro, FAQ, Resources, About, Members Page, and a page to showoff our projects if anyone wants to.

Note that this is a community college, so...I have a feeling it'll be a mix of young people and a wide age range of adults with beginner skill. (I don't know much myself) I appreciate any suggestions and thank this sub so much in advance. I'm gonna ask around more and ""steal"" ideas from the more well known CS clubs.",3,7

12,2017-9-3,2017,9,3,4,6xo7vh,Computer Science Vs Math ? How does Computer Science handle problem solving differently from Math?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6xo7vh/computer_science_vs_math_how_does_computer/,Mumin2,1504379335,"Hi,

I have been trying to understand the essence of CS, I have asked questions, taken online courses but those lead to more questions and gaps in my understanding, I'm still missing the point, I can't look at the subject from a general point of view. Here is what I've got so far:-

I know that CS is about solving all sorts of problems that are solvable,  regardless of their nature, and I know problem solving is done in an algorithmic manner, and that computers are nothing but tools to execute the solution...

BUT THEN, math also solves problem, I know i just said that CS solves problems algorithmically, but i'm not sure what that actually means, I mean, I can take the rules from math and put them into an algorithm (at least for simple operations like addition, division..etc) and I will get myself a solution, SO WHAT DOES CS DO THAT MATH DOESN'T ? 

So in that case just mentioned the line between math and cs is blurry for me, however I have taken a numerical analysis course before, where we studied methods for solving differential equations   using some iterative methods instead of solving them analytically using rigorous math, and despite the fact that iterative methods do use some math (simple operations, integration..etc) THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT from the analytic math solutions. 

SO DOES THAT MEAN that CS approaches all problems in a universal way, which is by a set of sequential operations that rely on some mathematical basis that is not necessarily relate to the mathematical way of solving the problem at hand (algorithms), and that CS uses this 'algorithmic' way because it goes well with how computers work, and it is the responsibility of the computer scientist to come up with an algorithmic solution that solves the problem

Is this really the difference?  

If this is true, I would like to know if there have been some problems, that are solvable, but whose mathematical solution is hard to derive and their solution have been found with the help of CS.

I'm pretty new to VLSM and I'm working through one of my first problems. For each network topology given, I'm trying to determine the network address, broadcast address, second usable IP, and the subnet mask in dotted decimal notation. 

I don't quite understand how to determine the subnet mask, or how to get from slash format to dotted decimal. Feel like I've been googling it for a little while now and I'm getting a sore head. Maybe I just need a break, but anyways, if anyone can explain it in ELI5 terms that would be amazing :) 

Here is an example of my problem: 
Main network address: 192.168.1.0/24 

Subnet A: 41 hosts 
Subnet B: 88 hosts 
Subnet C: 12 hosts 
Subnet D: 12 hosts 
Subnet E: 2 hosts. 

Would I be correct in saying that the subnet mask for B is 255.255.255.128, 
A is 255.255.255.192, 
C is 255.255.255.208, 
D is 255.255.255.224 and 
E is 255.255.255.228? 

I just got those by adding 1 to the broadcast address for each, but don't know if that's correct. It feels wrong.. 

I know that B  = /25 
A = /26
C = /28 
D = /28 
E = /30 

How do I get from the slash to 255.255. etc etc?

Anyways, sorry if I rambled too much. Not sure how much info is actually needed for someone to help, so just chucked what I thought was needed in.

Note: No need to read the whole thing...I just have a question and you can stop reading where it says ""---end question----"". I just added extra for those interested in what I'm up to. 

I'm looking for a content hosting script that can do the following 

- work both online and offline (so self-contained)
- can limit the number of total allowed users to one million
- can limit the total amount of content space per user to one megabyte (or a total of one terabyte per million users)

- allow all content and user interface to be downloaded from the live site to a two terabyte hard drive where it can be periodically updated from the live site with any new content.

- have a login to protect users content (both public and private) from other users

- allow any remaining space on the 2 terabyte hard drive to be filled with the latest news and videos

- and lastly, allow me to transmit the content of the offline 2 terabyte hard drive to the surrounding neighborhood with an open wifi router and long range antenna. 

Basically, I'm proposing a hybrid piratebox on steroids that I call 1megabyte after the 1 megabyte per user limit.

----end question----

Essentially, instead of loading an individual piratebox with our own individual content and seeking out crowded places to make it work, we copy a live data limited social media site specially created for the purpose of providing one terabyte of content from one million different users to hard drives in millions of Internet ready homes, which then make the hard drive content available to anyone in their neighborhood through an open wifi router connected to the offline hard drive and transmitted with a long range wifi antenna.

As the content spreads, the next user in the chain transmits the content further with their own open wifi signal.

In this way, instead of content remaining local and detached in pockets from other towns and people, it gets replicated and spread globally, both as a meshnet and wherever there is regular internet. 

To put it in terms of a meshnet: Imagine taking a meshnet in New York of 20,000 users and a meshnet in Boston of 20,000 users. You replicate both meshnet's content online, combine them so you have 40,000 users and transfer 40,000 users worth of content to an open wifi enabled hard drive. The only difference is you do it in reverse and start with a million online users.

People with Internet in any area who participate can transmit the millions of user data to those in their area without Internet, updating daily. In other words, it would be an Internet within the internet that can be transmitted through and open wifi signal or is portable enough to be quickly dropped off by car to whoever is too out of reach to grab a signal. And then they in turn can transmit the content to anyone around them.

And as new users join, more hard drives can be added...two hard drives, two million users, three hard drives, three million users, etc...

Each user would only have login permission on the numbered hard drive that they were assigned when the joined the network. But, if they also already have regular internet, they could login online or...if someone within wifi range has the same hard drive number they were assigned or...they could work out a daily hard drive delivery schedule with someone nearby who has Internet and wants to participate in the network.

It's not a full internet but it's more daily updated digital content via millions of different users than one person could ever go through in a single day.

It's not going to compete with the real time Internet of the isp's...but it would at least be something decentralized and either free (after equipment purchase) or very cheap. 

If we only charged every user $2 it would pay for the hosting of the live site.

With a single set of registers and cache, how does a modern CPU manage 2 or more processes running at the same time without losing state for them? I can't imagine that it's being saved in main memory somewhere, which would be super costly. In that case, does multiple running processes have an effect on cache hit/miss chances for any single process? And how is CPU time delegated to processes, in a way that all running at the same time still manages to feel 'seamless', especially in cases where one program might not be very I/O bound if it's relatively small/simple (thus little opportunity for a context switch)? 
Obviously multithreading is a thing, but I guess I'm more curious about *how* multithreading works to address the problems I described (if they actually are problems).

Here are some of the topics covered:

* Authorization, Authentication and Access control, constructing RBAC models, 
* Symmetric encryption and common ciphers, and how to construct basic symmetric encryption schemes with relevant set theory.
* Assymetric encryption, RSA (with relevant number theory), DES, cryptographic hashes, and hash functions
* Public Key Infrastructures, signing and verification, certificates, trust models, certification standards like X.509, CRLs, key escrow
* Key establishment protocols with corresponding attacks, such as COA, KPA, Lowe's Attack, replay, oracle, binding, Diffie Hellman attacks etc.
* Basic application security guidelines.

The course itself was quite theoretical, which was great for me, but I'm finding that in practice on real machines these concepts seem a lot more enigmatic. Now I'm at a stage where I've developed a thirst for more technical security knowledge and practical experimentation (legal, obviously).

Where would be a good place to start / books to check out for getting deeper into this stuff? I've heard about the Cicada 3301 game and how participants were required to write RSA breakers for smaller prime numbers in python. Something like this sounds very interesting and I'm enthusiastic for that kind of thing.

I'm a Junior at Penn State currently dual-majoring in Information Systems Development and Cyber Security. I kind of fell in the trap of just wanting to do something I knew wasn't too difficult but still computer related and I wish I could go back in time and just major in Computer Science. But the fact is, I can't. I would love to become a programmer somewhere, a game developer would be a super cool job (although I realize that's a sort of niche job market). But every job that I see that interests me says they are looking for someone in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Math. However, my school only allows freshman who can take all the prerequisites in time to enroll in Computer Science.

I'm thinking about dropping the Cyber Security portion of my dual-major and just finishing up the Information Systems Development option online via World Campus. While doing that, I could take all of the required math and physics courses at a local community college and maybe get a secondary degree in Computer Science at Temple or something? Or should I just try to go straight for a Masters in it after taking all of the Math/Comp Sci prerequisites? But would all of the Masters prerequisites combined with my current degree make the Bachelor's worth getting? I'm still unsure and very confused what I should do.

I currently have a really good internship at a great company, only issue it's for general IT, or Tech Operations. I would love to be able to get into programming, software engineering, or game development. I've been doing a lot of C# and C++ training on my own time, but my current Systems Development major really only uses Java. What do you guys think?

I'm currently a Sophomore CS student at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, which is arguably one of the top CS schools in the country. Within my past year, I've learned more than CS students at the University of New Mexico in their first 3. I feel proficient in both C and Python, and I will be learning Java and self teaching myself Swift next year. As a person, I'm very computer/server/tech driven in general, and overall, i just love computers.


However, I have more passions than just code. I've produced EDM for about 5 years now, and I'm very into journalism and theater, but never got into it. I guess im just a naturally ""arty"" person. Don't get me wrong, i'll always code raspberry pi's and apps on my free time because i love it, but i cant help but feel i was *meant* to produce art and exercise my creativity. One of the things I like most about coding, is how you can develop your own style and solve problems your own way.

Additionally, i want a ""college experience"". Sports, maybe a party here and there, getting coffee with friends, black student union, clubs, just an experience i feel like im currently lacking. At NMT, its all work. This guy accurately describes my college [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0lSpB1jPws). I have a high GPA here, so i would say im pretty responsible in terms of getting work and school done. It's just... i cant help but feel like i'm missing out on life. 

So, I guess my question would be, should i stick with CS and do arty stuff on my free time? Or, should i put all my eggs in the art basket, travel to a college in Georgia or something, and start anew? I don't know. I'm very conflicted, and i told myself that i should have a final decision by the end of my sophomore year.

TL;DR should i just drop out of CS at a tech school and pursue a ""real"" college and majoring what i like doing most, with possibly a minor in CS?",10,4

I've recently decided to make the leap and read through a bunch of computer science books to better equip myself for the future.

At the moment I'm reading through converting signed to unsigned decimals.
I understand the majority if it (hopefully it becomes easier to eventually), but struggling with the following (in 32-bit):

-2147483647-1U &lt; -2147483647

According the book, this evaluates to true.
There's a bit about this that I'm still struggling with as I cant see why it evaluates to this.

With my understanding, I know that they are both converted to unsigned values in this calculation due to the first number being cast as unsigned. 
The first number is therefore -2147483648 after subtraction and then converted to unsigned, or does that unsigned conversion happen prior to the subtraction?

Sorry for the lengthy post, just trying to get my head around understanding this.

Thanks!

So over the the past several years, I noticed that there are concepts that link Computer Science, and Philosophy in my high school mathematics courses. For instance, in my Geometry courses, I learned inverse, converse, and contrapositive statements along with conditional statements. It was strange that these concepts were in a mathematics course since conditional statements can be applied to something outside of arithmetic. 

In my college Philosophy courses and online, there was a time when I learned *Pascal's Wager*, which was made by the same mathematician responsible for *Pascal's Triangle*.

Lastly, in my Computer Science courses, I noticed that conditional statements, arrays, booleans, and deductive reasoning incorporated into the programming process. I find this rather interesting to see three subjects intersect. I like how the three disciplines utilize logic and reasoning but I do not know how to make sense of this.

So I've been learning to program for about 4 or 5 years now. And I considered myself pretty good. I know a handful of languages, and I can understand every concept that was ever presented to me. I didn't know it, but I could at least understand what was being said.

So naturally I decided to major in computer science. This is my first semester and I love it so far. But dear God is it fast paced. Luckily for me and my friend who have been programming for years now, we can keep up pretty well. But there are a surprising number of students that have *never written a line of code before*. These people are as you might have guessed, dying internally every day that we have class because they have no prior concept of programming. If they aren't now, then they will be when we get assignments that require us to use things that weren't explicitly stated in class.

Now this isn't to deter anyone from majoring in computer science. It's a challenging and rewarding field. However, I would definitely go so far as to say that you should already have a head start to not drown in concepts. We all know how it was when we were first introduced to programming. It was mind boggling until we figured it out. Every programmer has a *moment* when it clicks for them. But that moment can take up to a year or more to happen. And I would hate to be in a college programming class before it clicks.

So to anyone browsing this subreddit looking for advice in starting a path, I strongly recommend you start learning through the internet as much as you can before putting yourself in a college class. It's free, and it'll be a huge help. You don't need the 4.5 years that I've had, you just need to get your brain thinking in the right terms.",2,3

Then, I realize I need to practice something, so I make a testSourceProject.py, but then remember I made a view based on testProject.csv, so I make an exploreTestProject.sql. But then I download that dataset into a separate directory, and I want to test something on that, so I make testExploreTestProject.py. But then I want to join some columns from this file on the file in the original directory and create a new file, but what do I call it and oh no someone needs help with something so I close my system and five minutes turns into and hour and then I go to lunch and when I come back I have no idea what anything is.

A lot of the work I do is ad-hoc, so I make things quickly and without a lot of time to plan. What are some good guidelines for file system management?

I am hoping this is the sub best suited for this question, apologies if not.


I have had an interest in programming (more specifically Game Development) for a long time.  I did well in my high school Computer Science classes but due to being young and stupid (and drugs) I never really followed through.  I am comfortable on a computer, and probably a little more savvy than the average Joe albeit maybe dumber in some areas. I have decided that the best way to learn is to just start screwing around while saving up money for some schooling.  

One of the biggest issues with just starting to learn however is the severe lack of technical know how I have.  I am a baby when it comes to the actual processes involved with making a computer run.  I am vaguely aware of things like RAM (Random Access Memory is it?) but need help really understanding these basic concepts before I can move further.


I have been googling around and have found some things, but thought that finding a helpful and informative subreddit might be a good start.  Is anybody aware of any good online lessons, or have any basic knowledge to impart onto me?  Thanks in advance, and sorry if this is not the proper sub for this kind of basic learning.

I'm currently a Junior in college at a CSU (California State University), majoring in CS with a minor in Philosophy (both two things I love dearly). My experience with CS has been quite expansive to this point -- I've both helped teach and privately tutor CS to high school (AP) and college students, and currently run a freelance web development business as well as work as a Web Programming Assistant for my campus' Library.

I'm starting to think about what I'd like to pursue after I get my Bachelor's Degree in (hopefully) two more years time: I'm very drawn to the idea of getting my MS, and possibly Ph.D, in Computer Science. While I know that CS is an ""applied major,"" meaning I could probably get a job right out of college with my Bachelors if I played my cards right, I love the idea of continuing to learn about the subject, focusing/specializing in a specific topic, and possibly doing research in the field (attempting to strongly connect it to Philosophy outside of AI is a long-running dream of mine). I'm passionate both about learning and Computer Science -- I love it, and can't see myself doing anything else in the long run. Initially, I was only looking to get my Masters, as teaching CS long-term isn't the *first* thing that comes to mind for my career plan, but some programs I'm eyeing such as the one at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/prospective_students/grad_programs_overview) only offers their Ph.D program as ""Full Time,"" but you get your MS in the process.

My main question is this: What would you suggest? For those with more experience, would you say that a Masters and/or Ph.D are worth it for someone not planning to stay in academia for the long-haul?

I am currently working on a project with a few classmates to make a product that would suit a customers needs for a given market.Our group decided on making a program similar to other duplicate file programs that will locate duplicate pictures, videos, music, text, or program installers that are already present on your computer. It will prompt the user to select the directories they would like to search in and compare files for any duplicates present. It will then create a local database using generated hash codes to compare any newly added files in the specified directorys based on file type. It will always be running in the background and check the folders every 10 seconds.I would like to make the analogy that other duplicate file searchers are to (free)Malwarebyes as our program is to anti virus software. That is, other programs only fix the issue after it occurs while ours does that initially as well as prevents duplicates from being saved unnoticed in the future. Of course it wont just automatically delete it (unless user specifies so). It will create a popup noting that the downloaded file is a duplicate of another file on the machine. Unlike the built in windows feature, which either tells you that a file with the same name is in that directory or simply adding (1) to the name, it scans the actual content based on a percentage (either say 80% or 90% similarity), so pictures with watermarks and work documents with a slight change in words would show up. This would also work great with multiple hard drives as it is not single directory dependent. In the case of backups on the computer, simply add ""- backup""(or user specified input) to the file name to ignore that file in the search. 

We are required to interview at least 10 people for our proposal. I would like to ask a few questions regarding our ""product."" Try your best to explain each response.

1. Have you ever come across an issue where you had multiple files on your computer that were duplicates? How often does it occur?
2. Do you think our product would aid you in fixing the problem? How about making it easier to prevent the issue?
3. What would set our product apart from other known products of the same market? As in, what kind of features are expected that would make our product better than other current competitors?
4. What type of payment would realistically be better for this product? Would a free 7-day trial with one time payment of say $20 be better than free with advertisements or a subscription based product at $2 a month?

I know most of the people on this sub have experience in this field, and I have a few concerns.

To begin with some background: I'm currently in my 2nd year at a community college.  I'm majoring in Exercise Science, but decided a long time ago that I don't want to stay in the field. I realized that the field doesn't have the best job prospects, and my interest just isn't fully there. For nearly the past 8 months, I've spent countless hours researching and pondering on what I could possibly major in. I honestly think I'm overthinking it WAY too much. 

Anyways, I've been back and forth with several different majors. I've gone from physical therapy, to accounting, to finance, to economics, and of course... computer science.  Recently I applied to a few schools, but I'm hoping to get into Penn State (off branch campus). When I applied I chose accounting. From what I understood, the field had great job prospects, advancement possibilities, and a fairly high salary potential. I enjoy doing basic arithmetic/math and working with numbers. Aside from that, i don't have much of an interest of working in that field. 

Recently I got a job with my mom for a huge chicken company in the accounting department. I only work 2 days a week, 8 hour days. Maybe it's what I'm doing or the location, but I know for a fact I don't want to do that the rest of my life. Originally my plan was to major in something of the business field, but that made me reconsider everything.

Anyways...

I've been considering computer science. I read so much positivity about how people are happy they chose this major, or regret not doing so. I've always had an interest in working with computers. I'm fascinated with being able to create websites, apps, games, anything. I don't have much experience with programming aside from a class in high school. I've always had an interest in it though. I think learning how to program would be fascinating (and a nice skill to have).  I've not only wanted to work with computers, but understand why they do the things they do, and learn how to make those things happen. (Hardware and software). 

I have a few worries with pursuing this major:

1) Math requirements: I believe I will have to take up to calculus 1, 2, as well as discrete math and linear algebra. I took Calc in high school but struggled, mainly due to lack of effort. I took trig in college, but didn't have the best grade. (The professor took points off for everything, all my grades were tests.) I honestly believe if I put the effort in to understand Calc and other math I would enjoy it. I do enjoy it when I know what I'm doing. I'm still worried though.

2) If I have no programming experience, is this a smart decision? Will I struggle? 

3) Am I just better off majoring in something else? Perhaps finance or economics?

I'm sorry this was so long.. I hope I can get some help. Thank you for reading!

I graduated high school from a small private school a few years ago. I took a short CS class there which persuaded to me pursue a degree in computer science. The class was only half a year long and was taught by a teacher who was by no means a CS expert. She was actually an anatomy/biology teacher, and to my knowledge, she read a few weeks ahead in a Visual Basic textbook and taught us based on that. I applaud her effort and am grateful for her exposing me to the world of programming.

As an alumni of this private high school, I want to encourage them to offer at least one CS class for their students. Now the school only has a total enrollment of a little more than 200 students. Needless to say, this school has limited resources so what kind of solution can I offer? Is there some sort of online program that they can offer their students? They don't have, and won't find, a teacher that is capable of teaching computer science. I want to find a solution to this problem, but I don't know how. (p.s. Is there another subbreddit I can post this to to get a wider audience?)

I am doing Computer Science at A level and I feel like I understand all the lessons and the content. I feel I do apt amounts of revision for tests and mocks, however I always under perform (targeted A/B and getting low Bs or Cs).

My downfall seems to be algorithm questions in Comp 2 papers and the longer questions in Comp 1 (6 - 9 mark questions).

For example I remember before a mock memorising some definitions for DNS servers and their uses, wrote these answers in the exam and got no marks, the mark scheme had something completely different to the book.

I'm hoping to aim high and go for university but my lack of improvement has got me worried, just wondering if anyone had techniques or criteria for these sorts of questions, also if anyone could suggest good revision techniques for the bulk of the content as I feel like just notes are causing me to forget and miss out bits of content.

I know you guys get lots of questions about which degree to take, but I'm hoping you guys can give me some unbiased insight before I contact the university I plan to attend about this. 

The university I would like to attend offers a special degree in software engineering, a business administration-computer information systems, and applied math-computer science. I've already ruled out the business degree(too much business lol) but I'm stuck between software engineering and math.

If you want/care the catalog for the software engineering degree is [here](http://unco.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Undergraduate-Programs/Bachelors-Degrees/Software-Engineering-BS) and the math degree is [here](http://unco.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Undergraduate-Programs/Bachelors-Degrees/Mathematics-BS-Applied-Mathematical-Sciences-Emphasis) (you can skip out on the applied mathematics concentration and the applied stats concentration.) I've met with some faculty for the software engineering degree, and they've told me that, while it's a relatively new program, it offers real-world experience through the senior project that involves creating software for a real company. I've not met with any of the math degree faculty but hopefully, I'll make another trip there before I have to choose.

One more thing, the software engineering degree is a partnership between the business college and the school of math. The business college has received many high praises and has won a presidential award of business excellency. My only worry with the software engineering degree is that I won't have enough math to help me stay on top of new technologies, and not having the knowledge provided by math will hurt me in interviews.

My worry with the math degree is that it doesn't seem to teach too much actual programming, which I know isn't the point of a CS degree but it would be nice to have. I know I can self-teach(I'm working on OSSU's CS degree) but I learn better in a classroom environment.

People have told me Algorithms is an important class, especially for interviews, and it is definitely helpful to have a professor guide you through the course as compared to self-teaching.

I feel that Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, is going to be huge in the future so it may be a good idea to take this class. Also, I have heard this class is less time-consuming so it might be easier on my schedule.

I have just started my second year of university doing CS. I have been coding for the last 3 years which isn't a lot. My peers have a lot more knowledge compared to me. I have been trying to catch up but the thing I fail most at is giving up. 


My whole life I have been a perfectionist, I have always had good grades and rarely failed. I've always been a quick learner too.


But I am struggling soooo much with CS. Not the technical stuff. It's more of the ""oh my god, I can't seem to solve this. I am so stupid, all my peers can solve this, why can't I? Why am I so rubbish. I give up."" 


I know this isn't the right mindset to have with CS because it's such a problem solving orientated course. But I can't help it. It's given me a certain type of anxiety. I've avoided working on my skills to avoid this anxiety. 


Today I went to my first hackathon - I thought this would be the time I could have a fresh start. I decided to create a website using Visual Studio and I struggled so much. I couldn't find a way to have a picture on the website which seemed sooooo simple, yet I couldn't figure it out. I tried for over 2 hours and in the end, I cried and gave up.


I feel really demotivated, to the point where I'm not enjoying any of this anymore. I feel such a pressure to succeed. I guess I need to find a way to stop this anxiety and overwhelming feelings but I don't know how to ""play"" with code with a clear mind. It's stopping me from progressing.

A question asks ""Consider a system in which threads are implemented entirely in user space, with the run-time system getting a clock interrupt once a second. Suppose that a clock interrupt occurs while some thread is executing in
the run-time system. What problem might occur? Can you suggest a way to solve it?""

Answer: It could happen that the runtime system is precisely at the point of blocking or unblocking a
thread, and is busy manipulating the scheduling queues. This would be a very inopportune moment for the
clock interrupt handler to begin inspecting those queues to see if it was time to do thread switching, since
they might be in an inconsistent state. One solution is to set a flag when the run-time system is entered.
The clock handler would see this and set its own flag, then return. When the runtime system finished, it would check the clock flag, see that a clock interrupt occurred, and now run the clock handler.

Could you help explain the answer in more depth? I understand that threads are like ""sub processes"" of processes that can run simultaneously and all have their own stack but share a heap. I also know that clock interrupts halts/switches processes. Other than that, I'm lost.

However one class I struggled with in undergraduate studies was Algorithms. 99% of the time I knew the answer to a given problem but I could rarely create a formal proof. Usually I would just try to cogently explain my train of thought and I at least got partial credit.

Now I'm in my graduate studies and I'm experiencing the same nightmare except more difficult. Does have any advice for me? I know that practice makes perfect but I can't seem to get any better. The method I struggle with most is by far mathematical induction. It simply does not ""click"" with me despite understanding the principle so I can never apply it to problems easily. Neither my undergraduate book nor graduate book has been much help; I can't overcome the feeling that the problem creators are pulling solutions out of thin air.

I know this is fairly open-ended but any advice regarding this or resources/videos that teach this skill clearly in a non-esoteric way would be greatly appreciated.",2,7

Among other things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7237l6/feeling_discouraged_defeated_and_stuck_among/,tea_sus,1506228467,"Tl;Dr : Struggling to understand what's being taught, doing poorly in classes, and as a result doubting if I should keep trying for a CS degree or start all over again.

First off, I apologize for the long read, possible spelling errors, repetition, and if I'm not too clear on what Is being said(clarity and articulation is not something I'm known for haha).I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I don't really have someone I know who'll possibly understand all this.  

A little bit of background:
  I'm 23 (about to turn 24) years old, and I started college in the fall 2012 with no major declared and just got all of the basic math and English courses out of the way before I finally declared a major around the fall of 2015 and chose a BS in CS since I am genuinely interested in that field. 
   Well, my first semester went smoothly, but I registered late and the CS classes were full so I think other required classes do my degree.  During my second semester, some personal issues popped up, and I couldn't understand what was being taught, and I failed most of my classes, and decided to take a year off from school to dust myself off and try again. The first semester back --spring 2017-- I met with my advisor and it was recommended that I switch to a BA in computer science so I can graduate quicker and not stay even longer in college and so I switched. I did well and even my CS professor had commented on how it seems I've improved dramatically. Cut to this semester, which the CS classes I'm taking are intro to Data structures and Machine programming and organization, and once again I find myself struggling. I'm taking notes, reading the material, and even asking those who understand what's going on and I have pretty low C's in those classes. 
   According to my degree audit and assuming I miraculously pass these classes, I have about two years left, With only CS courses and non-CS upper division courses left to take. Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to try my hardest to make sure I pass, but in the possibility that I don't pass I see a few options: 
1. Next semester take the other sophomore CS classes (which i feel like I may not be able to pass those since I'm struggling with the classes I have now) and risk just completely feeling like I can't do this if I fail, 
2. Start all over with a different degree, which means adding more years to my already long tenure in college. 
3. Just start finding a full time job in something I don't need a degree in (I know this isn't the best option, this one isn't really likely, but it is an option nonetheless)
 And there's possibly other options I'm not aware of at the moment. 

I'm stressing, starting to feel like I'm failing everyone who wants to see me graduate in CS, and starting to slip into a depression. I want to keep going, but Im starting to feel worn out and over school, I want to graduate so bad but this is killing me. I just don't understand the material. Or understand if I should even major CS anymore. I feel lost, defeated, depressed, angry, overwhelmed, and just like I'm going to be stuck in college until I'm 30 or older while everyone I know and grew up with graduates this/next semester or has already graduated.
   Again, I apologize for the long vent(/pity party ha), and if this isn't the appropriate sub for it, I just don't have someone who could help understand my situation. Any advise is welcome. If there isn't any, well, thanks for possibly hearing me out anyways. Ha

Linear Search also known as Sequential search is a well known searching algorithm which uses the method of sequentially checking each item in a list until the target value is found or all items have been checked and the target value isnt found. Linear search makes O(n) comparisons to sort n items (number of items in a dataset) meaning that it has a worse case of having to make n comparisons. I.e if the target value was not in a list of 1,000,000 items linear sort would have to make 1,000,000 comparisons before determining the target value not in the list.  You may be thinking that linear searches O(n) comparisons is incredibly inefficient, and it technically is, but is widely used because linear search can search an unsorted list. The second searching algorithm I will be analysing needs a sorted list in order to function, making it inoperative in certain situations.















Binary Search 

Binary search also known as Logarithmic search is another well known searching algorithm that uses a technique to find the position of the target value in a sorted list. This is easily said as picking the middle item of the list and comparing it with the target value (item you are trying to find), if this comparison is true the position of the target value is returned (in this case the middle). If the middle and target value are not the same binary search compares if the target value is greater than the middle value if this is true the middle value and everything behind it is eliminated if this is false the middle value and everything ahead of it is eliminated. This process is repeated again and again until the whole list is searched or the target value is found.",2,9

I always hear in the news, youtube videos and forums/discussions all the hype and phobia about AI and I am having difficulty understanding why there is such fear. That is for the scenario that AI is as powerful as a human, or even more powerful and will try to ""destroy"" us.


I am no PhD expert with decades of research in this area, but I don't see how it would be possible for our ability to implement a fully advanced AI (not a super AI) in the near generations. I do acknowledge that this is a legitimate possibility and something bound to happen but I just don't understand how it is possible to do this huge leap towards singularity within our lifetimes or our grandchildren's lifetimes. 


Our AI and implementations of it (Machine Learning etc) Are very limited, to specific problems. E.G. We can make a self-driving car that drives better than a human. Or We can make a better chess player, or better Dota 2 player. But we are so far away from a generic type AI. 


I think in order to be able to make something so complicated as a super AI (which is supposed to at least imitate humans and/or human rationality/thinking process at some extend) we have to first understand our own brains and bodies. 


Our ability to understand our own bodies, motives, brain structure is so limited and archaic. We are such complicated ""machines"" that we are having difficulty comprehending our own selves or actions.  E.G. When was the last time you got mad? How did it benefit the situation? How did you act rationally in that situation? 

We act irrationally, unpredictably and our approach to solve problems or think can depend to as much as our current mood. And yet we have no clue of why and what happens. Sometimes we don't even know why medicines work, and we can't tell why is someone sick, why is someone mentally deranged and how to fix that.

Therefore I don't think we can realistically even get close to a super AI within generations to come and go by.  


On the other hand in the likely scenario that we do manage to get close to a Super AI. With or without knowledge of the human body and brain. There is going to be so much benefit in our society before an apocalyptic scenario of a skynet arises. Imagine an AI that performs research on a topic 24/7 thousand times faster than the human pace. We will have done research that would ordinary take thousands of years in the span of few years. Forget about diseases, famine, consumerism. It is a utopia, everything is manufactured automatically at no cost (since everything would be automated and no human would be required to work). 


In either case scenario I don't see how it would be a bad idea to push research in AI and not be spreading fear about something so simple. 

**TL:DR; Advancement in AI is not as fast as we want it to be to reach singularity level. Even if we reached singularity level we would have so much more to benefit than to be afraid of.**

I understand the concepts such as memory management with malloc - I understand pointers, linked lists, binary search trees, I understand all of these concepts to a certain extent BUT I cannot seem to understand how to successfully apply them given a problem I have been attempting to do some problems on CodeWars but am having trouble with even easier problems. Is there any recommend reading or videos anyone can recommend to help me better understand algorithmic thinking? Or does my brain just not work that way and am doomed in computer science? ",1,5

I'm a senior this year in computer science. I skipped freshmen year because I obtained a lot of college credits in high school. Definitely grew up ahead of the game.

Well, now I'm behind. Skipping a grade was great tuition wise but I was behind most of my classmates knowledge wise and experience wise. They just had more experience than I did so it made it harder for me to get internships. This last summer the upcoming senior class had to have an internship. Well, I had one (really not a great one, but it had ""internship"" in the title and wanted SOMETHING) but that burst into flames and I had to step away from the internship because of family issues and do a project instead (Android App).

So here I'm at senior year, no internships/ experience and only one project. I'm hoping to do more projects this year but I'm feeling discouraged. 1) I have to present my project to a class full of people that all got internships and 2) I just am worried about not getting hired from lack of experience. 

Also I get hella nervous during interviews so that's definitely botched some in the past. 


(I also may or may not be feeling a bit shitty coming out of a web developer internship that did not go so hot).

I am concerned that we will be unable to use this language in the real world, as most students take AP classes that mirror their possible future interests, and that we are not going to be prepared for the AP test to come. 
Our teacher is new to teaching AP and relatively new (2nd year) to teaching any sort of computer science curriculum. As someone who has very little experience with Java, I seem to know more than her about Snap!, whenever there is a question regarding the project we are working on she is unable to help us due to her apparent lack of knowledge regarding anything programming related. 
The projects we are making on Snap! all seem incredibly elementary (making games,pinwheels, etc) and seem to show no correlation to anything of relevance in the actual programming field. We are not taught in anyway how to use Snap! and work through projects based on step by step instructions made by another teacher. 
Our AP test is in pseudo code since it is not a Java or Python specific curriculum. She has not taught the correlation between Snap! and pseudo leaving students completely clueless on practice problems since we do not have the ability to drag and drop our answers on paper. 
I ask all of you more experienced programmers what your thoughts are on Snap itself and whether or not it is even relevant in the world of programming, also your opinions on whether Snap is appropriate for an AP level course. Sorry for the long post and thank you!",8,2

Top it off, this is my third time taking systems programming. My first semester, I just gave up in that course. The second semester I buckled down and still failed due to the exams being 100% code based pen and paper exams. In my mathematics courses, I've done well, actually pursuing my minor in mathematics. So how do I get over this death by code? I can talk about the problem. Figure it how to do it( in theory), but when it comes to coding. I become a zen master...my mind goes blank.

Things I've tried. 
Bought intro/ crash course style books. Complete most of them. 
Would try r/ dailyprogramming exercises and cry myself into a ball. 

Last bit. I'm too far to turn back. I'm 3 core classes away from completing my major requirements. One of which is systems and the other I'm taking right now. All I would need are electives and programming languages. Since my concentration is in data science, all my electives will be what I need to gain my concentration.

I have been researching how a streaming service might be built from the beginning of having nothing to going live with customers. This is research for my hey I like to learn things urges. 

This type of device obviously needs a database (or databases). I can count at least three functional needs and maybe a fourth. 

Database needs will be:
1) Customers 
2) Content
3) Billing
4) Creators

In this type of service would those categories constitute one database or four databases? If it is four what kind of controller (sorry I dont know else to call it) would need to be created/programmed? How complex would it be to establish this database(es)? How many devs would be needed if the objective were to build it in 2 months, or 4 months?

There needs to be some login algorithms/protocols but I know little about them other than their existence. In my mind I think of them as locks on the front door, the more locks you have the more secure you are but you have to make sure that everyone who needs entry has all of the keys which reduces security. How secure would the algorithms for this type of service need to be? How complex are they to program? How many devs would be optimal? I assume that at some point extra programmers just start to get in each others way. Once the algorithms are setup do they require constant attention (everyday), or are they more of a periodic thing? That probably has direct relation to the size of the user base. 

Aside from the actual interfaces (web, iOS, Android) what am I missing at this stage? Im sure there are many dozens of things I have no idea I should even think about. 

Again this is all hypothetical but with the sudden rise of steaming services it is highly interesting to me. Thanks for helping and providing whatever insights you may have. ",0,0

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could do this? My current plan is to find a cluster map of search querys, then treat the map like a markov chain and travel through it, sending the searches the algorithm lands on to bing. It's naive in that it doesn't take into account user interest or history, but I think it's good enough for my purposes. What do you think?

I've never actually visited this sub before but I need some advice from individuals who actually know what they're talking about concerning computer science.

I'm in my second year of university and I'm currently a biology major, in high school I loved all three sciences and were by far my best subjects. But when I came to college the work has become quite difficult and hard for me to comprehend, I feel like I'm just wasting my time in this major since I'll probably flunk out. I've always been very interested in computers since I could remember anything but my parents had always put it in my mind since I was a child that I couldn't go wrong in the sciences if I just ""put my mind to it"" it worked up until high school but it's just not clicking anymore. The love I once had for biology is no longer there. I've never gotten into computer programming before and I have little to no knowledge on it, in fact the only thing I can do just a little is create a webpage using a notepad. I am interested in the inner workings of a computer and since the biology thing isn't working out I figured I'd at least give it a shot. But before I head in there I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into, how demanding it is, the amount of time I'll need to put in and how hard it can get. And if you feel that since I have no prior experience with computer programming I can't do good in this major please let me know, any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
