Ive been considering coding boot camps because Im very interested in computers and the language. I know theres free courses ( Ive taken a few) but I know that career field is beyond living cost as of where Im at, my dad always pushed it, but my rebellious teen years turned me off of it. Now Im in a state where I need to get a living together so I can stop mooching off my parents and try to be successful as an individual and self reliant. I was considering community college then transferring to a university to fill a bachelors in computer science but theres also a local program where Im living that could cover the cost of a coding boot camp. Does anyone have experience (an honest review of the benefits of a bachelors vs a boot camp certificate) if so please share your experience! Just to recap, would the best option for someone to get into the field of software engineering be a boot camp or a degree? For job oppurtunities, indeed rarely pops up with anything in my state that shows any opportunity without hat leash a bachelors in computer science. Really trying to move out within a year or two to let my parents burden go. Thanks in advance.

Im in Albuquerque NM at the moment but if theres a good entry level anywhere else I wouldnt mind leaving with my savings",4,1

I'm working on an exercise that asks: Given two graphs, **G** and **H**, |V^(G)|=|V^(H)|=n,  implemented with adjacency lists, build a new graph **T**, |V^(T)| = n, such that:

*e* is an edge in **T** if

1) *e* is an edge in **G** and in **H**

2) weight(*e*^(T)) = p,        p = weight(*e*^(G)) + weight(*e*^(H))

3) p is even

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if for each vertex *v* and for each adjacency  *u* of *v* the algorithm searched that adjacency in the adjacency list of the same vertex *v*  in **H** , would it be too expensive?

I thought of implementing an array that at every iteration on *v* has 1 in position *i* if *v* is adjacent to *i* in **H.** In this way I can check in constant time if 1) is verified. But at each iteration I have to initialize the array, so it would be (n) for each vertex, resulting in (n^(2)). Any ideas or advices?

Thank you in advance!",6,3

I've always thought it was when a hash table reaches a critical load factor, and has to be resized and all key/value pairs hashed again.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this definition however, which seems to suggest rehashing occurs when a single/key value pair experiences a collision, and is posed as an alternative to chaining. They say that linear probing is used, but I thought this was just another method of collision avoidance like chaining? Has anyone heard of this definition before and is it valid?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Rehashing: In this case, if a collision occurs, the same algorithm is run again, or an alternative algorithm is run until a unique key is created. This normally uses a technique called probing, which means that the algorithm probes or searches for an empty slot. It could do this by simply looking for the next available slot to the index where there was a clash.",0,1

Well we're still in our second year of engineering and won't graduate till 2022 at least so we have the time.

Now that being said, I'm crazier than him. I want one of two things.
The first is help him in his project by making it a full computer (meaning: I want to make the hardware) but this sounds kinda boring and not that much useful since there are already companies for that.
The second is what I really want which is creating a nanotech with AI and I might be able to use my friend's project in the mix. Let's say I want to create a nano fly that can think a bit.

I've been thinking real hard about my future and looking at the schooling needed in psychology before I can really start working in the field. I dont want to do it. I can't see myself being a therapist and having a bachelors in psych won't cut it for the field. I already switched my major from computer networking to psych during my first term because that major wasn't a transfer degree, it was an applied degree meant for those looking to work after their associate's. 

My  community college offers a transfer degree in computer science and I've been thinking about switching majors to that. I'm not too far along in my degree right now, so most if not all of my classes so far would transfer over and I would just take different classes in the future. I love computers and I took an intro to computer science class in high school two years ago and liked it. It was hard but i was able to figure everything out and i loved the way I had to think in order to complete projects.

I would have already switched but the only thing holding me back is, of course, math. When I took my colleges placement test, I was placed into math 10 which is one class above adult basic skills. This is the very beginning of the math sequence. I already completed math 10 and would be at math 20 leaving about 8 or 9 math classes before I get my associate's and am at calculus level math. This means at least 3 years at my community college before I can transfer to a 4 year with junior standing.

Would you say this is worth the switch? I'm willing to put in the work and I dont hate math, I just had no idea of what I was doing in high school which led me to falling behind and not taking a math class my senior year. I really like psychology and learning about people, but I think I have more of a future in computer science, especially since I'm thinking about going into the FBI. There's also a lot of local software companies I'd be able to and love to work at.

Have any of you been in the same situation? How'd it go?

Tl;dr

&gt;I'm willing to share my algorithm with the public, under my credit. GNU if that's what you call it. Improve the code for the study of Latin squares, cliques, permutations, etc.    
&gt;  
&gt;It might be only interest for toy problems, but who knows maybe it'll bring somewhat non-trivial insight in Latin-Square Generation.  I've also noticed that cliques also exist in these Latin squares.   
&gt;  
&gt;I appreciate the people on Reddit who helped me with the code. They shall too receive credit (for the code)

&amp;#x200B;

To prevent confusion, some people mistaken that my code does not output a valid Sudoku Grid. And, I'm under the impression that they think it only works for *9 x 9*. It works for *n\^2 x n\^2*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Update:For readability, for this newer variant. You enter your input for grids larger than 9 x 9 as follows. **\[\[01\],\[02\]...\]**

        print('enter with [1,2,3...] brackets')
        tup = input()[1:-1].split(',')
        #Input required to map out valid n x m or n^2 x n^2 Sudoku Grid
        x = input('Enter mapping valid Sudoku eg. 3 for 9 x 9:')
        e = input('Enter 9 for 9 x 9 ...12 for 12 x 12:')
        f = input('Enter 3 if its a 9 x 9 ... n^2 x n^2:')
        x = int(x)
        e = int(e)
        f = int(f)
        #Manipulation of Elements to prepare valid grid
        squares = []
        for i in range(len(tup)):
            squares.append(tup[i:] + tup[:i])
            
            #Everything below here is just printing
        for s in range(x):
              for d in range(0,e,f):
                for si in range(s,e,f):
                  for li in range(d,d+f):
                    print(squares[si][li], end = '')
                print('')
    

I also have a link- Asking for anyone, who can disprove or prove that this algorithm can/can't generate valid Sudoku Grids of any size. I tried showing it asymptotically but those who are unfamiliar with my thought pattern will find it incoherent.

So I just finished my first semester of my computer science degree (first year) and I'm honestly bored af.

I spend most my time doing maths which I'm struggling a lot with.

I don't want to waste my parents money with a degree I feel like teaches me stuff I can learn online. I've been researching how to make an OS (for the fun of it) and I feel like I've learned more about programming and computers in that little time on my own than I have this past semester at university.

TLDR at the bottom if youre lazy and dont want to read the whole thing. Thanks for any advice, and thanks again if you actually end up reading the rest of the post.

Im currently a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering because I was told that since I was good at math and science, I should major in ChemE. I believed that for a while. I tried joining clubs and talking to professors, but I every time they got to talking about career paths as a ChemE I always zoned out to think about other things that interested me. I figured that it was just my adhd acting up. That it was my fault I couldnt pay attention while others were readily listening. So I stuck with the major for two years. It has been affecting my grades (having difficulty finding motivation to study), my ability to interact with others (since I cant find interest in my own major its a little hard to find common ground with people within my major), and most importantly its been negatively affecting my mental health (I cant really see a future for myself within chemical engineering, so Ive been feeling hopeless and depressed).

Recently I started volunteering in lab within my major (still ChemE) which I thought would inspire a desire to go to grad school since I cant see what I would enjoy doing with just a bachelors degree. Again I fell behind because I couldnt pay attention. And that resulted in me being afraid to ask questions and I kinda started trying to be as invisible as possible, which I think is largely due to social anxiety and a fear of being to harshly judged.

I started seeing a therapist to deal with the social anxiety, and as a result Ive cared less about how people see me and have become more active within the lab. the last few days Ive enjoyed it more because I am much more comfortable asking questions and talking to others within the lab since I am less afraid that they see me as baffoon for not paying attention in the earlier weeks. The only problem is, I still cant bring myself to read more articles and learn more about about what is going on within the lab. I have a much better understanding of the content (so I have the ability to do the readings), but I just cant find the motivation to do it.

The therapy also got me thinking about why I am so uncomfortable within my major, and got me started thinking about what I am actually interested in. I feel like I am a creative person, and a lot of the time when I am supposed to be paying attention in class, my mind wanders to how I would make a game out of what were learning. I took a intro to C++ class a couple semesters ago and I went out of my way to see how many alternative ways I could solve the homework problems rather than following the instructions, and for the most part the class, outside of the lecture, really clicked within my brain. I was never trying to avoid doing the assignments and was always looking for creative ways to complete them. I didnt tend to zone out while trying to learn either, like I had a habit of doing with chemical engineering.

I also found myself watching a lot of videos on YouTube a while back about timed game making competitions using coding and was really fascinated by the methods the people used to develop their games. 

What I want to do is switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science and specialize in game development but there are 3 problems:

1. Im already 2 years into chemical engineering, and itll probably take 4 additional years to complete a major in  computer science. Thats a lot of time to spend.

2. I am probably one of the more technologically inept people youll meet at the moment. The only coding experience I have is a little bit in my first semester, and the intro to C++ class that I mentioned earlier. I get confused easily when people talk about software and how their computer works but Im willing to ask questions. Im working on caring less about how people view me and how judgemental they may be. Since I have goals and aspirations I think approaching professors and people already working within the field will be easier than it was in ChemE, which I had a crippling fear of.

3. I also would be walking into the major with a blank resume. Almost none of the stuff that I have done so far relates to video game design, so Id imagine getting internships or coops related to my field would be difficult as well.  

Id imagine that making the transition between the two majors would not be smooth at all. Theres a lot of changes that Ill have to make, but I honestly think it will be worth it if I can be happy doing the career that I end up in. Im sure that this is what I want to do, the question is how do I go about this transition? Where do I start? I want to try and build my resume as soon as possible Ill take any help I can get.

Thank you all very much.

TLDR: Dont see a future for myself in chemical engineering so I want to switch to video game development, which I do have aspirations in, but I am the most technologically inept person you might meet. Please help me figure out how to make this transition.",13,24

My friend really loves computers and he told me he is learning a new programming language called flutter.Although that I couldn't convince him that computer science degree is more valuable than he thinks it is.
He makes the argument that it is not possible to match a person who worked day and night from youth until they have achieved a job and industry is filled with those people.
 I have tried to explain to him, from what incomplete knowledge I might have, that this is not entirely true and computer science is a big subject and it doesn't necessarily end up in being a programmer and even if it did the example you have given maybe a small percentage or not relevant to us and he continued his argument with University courses are ""outdated"" as in they teach old stuff that maybe entirely useless in real-life and he gave reasoning that the technology is advancing too fast for universities to catch up also further argues that universities can't teach programming properly due to class issues e.g. (class pulling you back,classes being inadequate,etc..) now he is not against university in anyway but he thinks computer science is not worth the time, he would rather just work himself until he becomes a good programmer if he wanted to become one.
He has also stated that he doesn't want to be a full time programmer, but I still think computer science is for him because I will believe (may be mistakenly) computer science is more than being  just a programmer, but of course he has his freedom to chose maybe he doesn't like computers as much my only concern is him falsely believing some ideas (if he is) and avoiding something he could have very much loved.

I would rather not disclose my professor's name or anything publicly, preferably not at all, and I definitely don't want him to find out I am struggling.

Thing is, it doesn't give a tight upper bound, right? It just gives *an* upper bound.

So when it is stated that some algorithm is, say, O(n^2) time complexity, it could really take linear time w.r.t input size, or even constant time - n and 1 are both in O(n^2). All that is being said is that the time taken definitely does not grow any faster than n^2. This seems counter to the common usage of such a statement, where the interpretation is typically that the time taken is approximately proportional to n^2.

It seems like Big O is really not that useful here, and that other measures would be better (perhaps Big Theta)? How come it's so commonly used then?",46,40

At first, I was a software engineering major but was dismissed from all CS majors offered at UCI due to poor grades. I went through some personal and financial problems in my first year of college, and it got to me last year.

This year I did a lot better, getting much better grades in my lower-div stats and Econ classes, and became an overall better student compared to my first year. I chose quantitative Econ because I heard its also a good major for Data science/data analyst positions. However, once in a while, my head keeps reminding me, You know if you tried harder, and your parents werent separating, or if you didnt work so much at a crappy part-time job off campus to pay off rent, you wouldve been fine in CS, and I really believe thats the case.

Ive been thinking about dropping out from UCI and going back to a community college to start over and get into a CS program at a different university. But I dont know if its the right move. I would like to stay at UCI, but as a soon-to-be-third-year who has to commute to campus (not close with many students), regretfully didnt become involved on campus, majoring in a major that doesnt directly relate to what they originally wanted to do, doesnt have any internships/experience under my belt, I feel like I should start over. Is this the right move?

My goal is always going to be working in tech, whether it be software engineering or data science. I genuinely enjoy coding and problem solving and would love to be able to dedicate my time in education to it. Economics is cool too and understand that the business aspect of it is beneficial too, but I feel like if I dont have a CS degree, itll be really difficult for me to land a job in tech. Or am I underestimating the power of an Econ degree?

If anyone has any advice for me, or has thought or been in this situation before or something similar, Id love to hear it. Thank you!",3,1

A lot of products or services are labeled engines purely out of marketing it seems. So, what makes something an engine?

For example, I have created a library that takes code and converts it into a series of commands by flattening the source file. Its my own language. So for example:

    Network
    {
        Adapter
        {
            Enabled = true;
        }
    }

Becomes:

    Network.Adapter.Enabled true

My library can generate much more complex data structures, and once you load data in from a source file, it can be edited too, then saved. It takes a source file, parses it, then converts the data into commands that can be ran. Saving a file takes those commands and runs an algorithm I have created that generates the source file.

My library is extremely fast and light weight as compared to XML. My library is also multi threaded. So since it takes an input and spits out an output, would it be considered an engine? If so, what kind of engine, and what should I name it?

The reason I ask is because translators are considered engines to some, hence why they call them translation engines. It takes a simple input, does a lot of complex work behind the scenes, and spits out an output.

If what I have created is not an engine, what should I consider it? I plan on publishing this as free and open source as soon as Im done writing the documentation and example projects but dont know what to market it as. This project was created as a way for game engines and video games to load data based on the old Quake config and command system, a lot of games and engines are based off of the ID engine and still use the same system. My system compared to the legacy system is much smaller, easier to use, allows for complex data, and is smaller in file size because it stores your data in a hierarchy. My library when generating source code also does automatic code formatting, syntax rules, and allows commenting.",27,58

If a 32-bit CPU can only process 4,294,967,296 bytes of RAM at a time, does it make sense to say that since every 8 bits equal 1 byte of memory then every single 32-bit memory-address equals 4 bytes of memory since 32 divided by 8=4?

(i.e. 00000000(1B)00000000(1B)00000000(1B)00000000(1B) 32-bit-memory-address)

 I do not know if this is useful to somebody or to science in any abstract way but please answer me.

When could the mathematical expression x = y.x be true?

Simple answer: When you equalize the perimeter of a fractal of circles within circles.

Looking at the expression face you think it is not true, if you replace x and y by numerical values will not have an equality. So I decided to think, when x = y.x could be true?

For my understanding, a fractal of circles is basically composed of the smallest circle to the largest, that is, the smallest circle represents 2phir, of perimeter, and the largest circle represents 2phirn, the issue that the largest and smallest representation in the fractal are equal , because you know that in a fractal the smallest graphic representation must be equal to the largest.

But speaking of the mathematical expression p = np or x = xy instead of the millennial problem, which has nothing to do with the millenarian problem with the mathematical expression what I am going to speak, this is part of an equation of a fractal of circles within circles representing that the smaller circle has the same perimeter measure of the largest multiplied one variable n, 2phir = 2 phirn. This is a mathematical representation of an argument, that you can match the expression x = yx and be true. To obtain the ratio of N, which is the ratio of each step of the fractal, beyond the difference between the first and last frame of the fractal, it extends infinitely in these repeated steps.

I know I was looking for the millennial problems and I came across this problem p = np, but before I read everything on the subject, just passing the view over I already wanted to solve the expression thinking, how could I state that p is equal to np, or when an expression x = yx could be true. Anyway, the answer is, in a fractal of circles on circles.

because mathematically thinking you can not say that x is equal to x times y, it's a mathematical expression that I think is incalculable.

But I started all this when a friend of mine drew a fractal of circles as we talked. And I linked the expression when I read over the expression with her drawing, like, look what a coincidence. Just this, is a curiosity that I wanted to expose, when x is equal to x times y? When it is part of a fractal of circles within others.

What I am now questioning is because in a fractal of circles on circles the ratio of perimeter between each circle is 39.47 considering that the radius of the smallest circle in a fractal of circles is 1.",8,0

I'm an incoming sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science. I just finished my first semester of technical courses a couple of weeks ago, and all went well until the 2nd week of summer came when I realized how super important side projects are. It seems everyone and everything is telling me to create side projects to build up my portfolio in order to flash it on my resume to secure pretty much *any* internship for summer of 2020 (I'm assuming applications are opening this coming fall, so my dead ass is also on a deadline). Alright, okay.

But what I don't get is how, *how* on Earth does anyone finish their side projects? I started like 5 over the last 2-3 weeks and I seriously cannot follow through on any of them let alone even finish half.

Apologies--I lost track of what I'm getting at here, but the point is I am my worst enemy stopping myself from finishing side projects.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically, I'm not your average CS dropout. I didn't even start my uni's CS program. I took one test to try and skip some of the base level pre-req classes, bombed it, and decided I'm more of a business person (which has worked well for me) although I still have a passion for tech/SaaS as my industry.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would consider myself a little more technical than your average lobotomized business worker. I've been able to learn quite a bit about marketing automation and integrations using 3rd parties such as Zapier, and I'm able to get pretty deep with our developers talking about our particular SaaS platformalthough I can't (and don't want to) write a lick of code myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone pretty deep into marketing automation and like to make things connect and work well together. I've noticed that a lot of these integrations are done using webhooks to alert other platforms so that data can flow or appropriate actions can take place. I do these kind of things a lot in Zapier, but sometimes I'm lacking the triggers that I need to make certain things happen. Zapier can accept webhooks as a trigger, so I'm wondering if there is a path there for me to grow my skill set and understand webhooks to make some of these integrations happen? 

&amp;#x200B;

Would I get laughed out of town if I asked a SaaS company that I'm trying to integrate with ""Hey, can you guys throw a webhook here so that we can do some automation?"" Is that a simple task, or does it usually take a good chunk of dev hours? Do you think those webhooks are something that I could create without having to get deep into writing code or learning CS?

Not trying to become a developer by any means. But if my plan makes any sense, and you do think that it could differentiate/make me more valuable to a company or business, how would you recommend I proceed? What should I start looking into first? Are there any courses that could be valuable?

This has made me realize that I was not even prepared for an internship. The interview didnt include a technical test. I understand programming concepts, I just dont have any experience or personal projects where Ive implemented them and thats why Im struggling.

I dont want to give up in this field yet as I dont feel like Ive really put in the effort to see if I can make it.

Im thinking of quitting and spending the summer doing the programming challenges &amp; algorithm workbenches in one of the Starting Out With... books, as I think thatll help me more (starting at like arrays/functions and building upon that...).

I see so many articles like ""why java is the best"" or "" why to learn python"" even ""java Vs python""  and they all seem to have been written by someone who loves said language, is there a resource somewhere for atleast low biased comparison of strengths and weaknesses, types of libraries available , even just a break down of what values the developers of each language have...

Then it stopped, 3sec silence, started again...stopped...started again...and so on. Since then it wont start. I cleaned the CPU, put new heating paste on it, put my GPU out and started with onboard GPU, same result. Then i started it with one Ram-bar. It started!!!

I really want to improve in DS and Algorithms, so I looked up online and came down to this plan. 

While Leetcode - 
1. Mathematics for CS - online course
2. Read - Algorithm and Design Manual
3. Read CLRS - Introduction to Algorithms
4. Do lots of mock and real interviews to practice.

I found simple guides but noticed they all covered the basics. The resources above seem to cover more than the basics and most people recommend them. I understand it will be challenging but feel like if I could get past these, I will have a better understanding of whiteboard problems and not get confused.

Now, I want to study CS instead of game design; People are telling me it's a bad idea to major in CS because it's too hard or unnecessary.


The past 2 years I've been learning to code and i'm almost done creating a game in C#. I loveee it. Coding is so organized and it makes so much sense. I've been thinking to study game design for a while, which is one of the reasons I originally got into coding. There's a university nearby that's known for their arts and tech programs and they have a strong game design program. The thing is, it's mostly art when, as much as I'm interested in the graphics side, I think it's too narrow of a scope. It doesn't seem to cover coding besides an intro class or two. Will I really want to only study how to design graphics in games the rest of my life?

Not really. I want to do the backend stuff. With this in mind, I'm considering switching to a CS major. Everyone I know warns me about how hard it is or how much math there is, but for some reason I don't think it will be nearly as hard as they say. I know many people who had to take CS classes and they felt it was really hard, but that's probably because they had never coded in their lives and had no interest in doing so. It's not something they enjoy. Looking at my self two years ago, I didn't understand a word of code so I get that feeling. Now that I do, I can't see it being so hard that I wouldn't want to do it. Of course uni is no walk in the park, that's a given, but I want to design things besides games, I want to create apps, websites and bots. I've been playing video games my whole life and the past 2-3 years got really interested in twitch, discord, from which I've been researching a lot about chat bots. I feel that I'm into the tech world enough to enjoy taking CS classes. And I know a big portion of it seems to be math theory classes but I can see how that's an important part of computer science or software engineering. My family is telling me that computer science is a lot of work for no reason, that I should take business or another major and minor in CS. I don't want to major in CS for the degree though, I want to do it to learn more about CS and programming. 

Is computer science really hard or is it only hard for those who don't know much about programing? It seems like only two types of people pursue it: Those that have never learned about coding in their lives and those that have been coding from the womb. Is there a lot of math in every university's CS programs or do some have more than others? Do you have to be good at math? My understanding is that uni takes over your life in general, but does CS take over your life even more than other majors? Could studying CS actually be enjoyable to those passionate about it? Is it worth studying something else and minoring in CS? Is there a better alternative for someone who wants to be a software engineer? 

Thoughts and advice appreciated. Thanks in advance!",31,38

How the hell am i gonna use/apply this to what i desire

I'm trying to get started with robotics but where do i even begin
after i'm done learning the syntax of python.

How do i apply it to real things

e.g. manipulating a computer/creating computers.


All these tutorials just explain the syntax explain what they do and leave you out to dry.
Any others that do teach you how to create stuff skip a big portion of the sutff i should've learned before they went and exposed me to whatever.
and confuse the living mess out of me.

I've yet to see someone explain the actual science of when/how 
you can truly apply what you learned in real life siturations not only that but actually retain info and truly learn off of what you just watched/read

His mathematician friend tells him that he would consider computer science a worthwhile field of study as soon as it contains 1000 deep theorems. Knuth writes that perhaps only 50 have been discovered so far. 

Now, after 47 years, have we reached the milestone of 1000 deep results? What are these deep results? 

The full quote from Knuth's article is below.

""One of my mathematician friends told me he would be willing to recognize computer science as a worthwhile field of study, as soon as it contains 1000 deep theorems. This criterion should obviously be changed to include algorithms as  well as theorems, say 500 deep theorems and 500 deep algorithms. But even so it is clear that computer science today does not measure up to such a test, if ""deep"" means that a brilliant person would need many months to discover the theorem or the algorithm. Computer science is still too young for this; I can claim youth as a handicap. We still do not know the best way to describe algorithms, to understand them or to prove them correct, to invent them, or to analyze their behavior, although considerable progress is being made on all these fronts.

I don't see the point. 

Is the developer shortage really that bad?

If kids or even a significant minority of them are required to program in the future (more so than usual) then the developers of today and tomorrow have monumentally failed society. Programming is getting easier by the year. Remember when machine learning was confided to academia and R&amp;D departments of big corporations? Now anyone interested can do it at home and do it in freaking Python.

Also, how many kids are genuinely going to be interested in the subject? The Maths and Science kids and nobody else. How many kids go on to further their study in STEM fields? The obsession with getting every kid into STEM needs to end, there's more to life. 

Sure, it'd be great to teach kids about some of the problem solving techniques that CS has to offer but I'd rather much have them focus on getting the statistics, calculus and linear algebra right first (something that isn't done taught properly in most schools). Programming is THE easiest part about learning how to program.",11,2

Anytime I see the Feynman Technique it seems like it works for understanding concepts. 

I want to remember algorithms more. Not remember every step but understand enough to know what to do when I see the algorithm again. 

E.g. Finding the maximum sum in an array in linear time using constant space.

Kadane's Algorithm is the first to come to mind. But what if a student like me wants to understand how the algorithm calculates current sums and updates the maximum sum of the inpjt array?

With the Feynman Technique, I would think they would write it down and try to understand each line of code. 

They would also try to visualise what they code is doing to the input. If they could do that, maybe they could understand enough to write the code again or do it a different way.

But I've looked over code challenges to practice and end up forgetting them because I don't study them effctively. Could the Feynman Technique be a good way or is there another way you recommend?",6,1

For example, say videos included an IP at the beginning and then the video data, but encrypted by the original owner's private key. Then when a web player plays a video, the player goes to the IP and asks for the public key, and if the player can successfully decrypt the video with the public key, it has verified that the IP owner is the original owner of the video. And so the player then goes to the IANA to ask who the IP is owned by and tells the viewer of the video (you), who the video is owned by. And so if the US government uploaded a video, the web player would tell it was from the US government or if the identity of the original uploader is unknown, it will tell you it is unknown. Would something like this work, or would there be too many hurdles, such as universal adoption? Or even, would this even solve the problem of being unaware of a video is legit or not?",3,3

Im curious to hear your thoughts - if I already have a B.A. in an unrelated field (Journalism), will an Associates in CS help get my foot in the door?

Im actually trying to branch into a Product Manager role in the tech industry. Ive been a PM outside of the tech industry for about 1.5 years, and I have about 2 years of Digital Marketing &amp; Sales experience behind that. But what Im finding is that, without hard tech skills, Im not fitting into the role that most Tech companies are looking for in PMs.

Therefore, Im considering a 2-year degree (and maybe a boot camp? Open to opinions there as well). I know many people are self-taught, but I really think Id do better in a structured environment.

- Is a 2-year degree in CS even worth it? In your opinion, will you learn enough useful info/skills/ways of thinking to succeed?

- I know many companies require a 4-year degree, but not necessarily in CS. Do you think a B.A. plus the associates will check this box?

- Im aware that with CS, you get out what you put in, and no degree will be a substitute for continued effort &amp; learning.

I was just thinking about this but could some stages of the FDE cycle possibly be removed or altered to make the cycle more efficient or even faster? For example, by removing the PC - could a regular clock be implemented into the MAR to increment the register so that it doesn't have to receive the address from the PC? Not only that, but could the MDR be removed too, by receiving data via the data bus and transferring the data directly to the CIR and being decoded by the CU in the register and saving time by not using the MDR, as a possibly unnecessary backup location, during this process? 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering this since if this was ever possible - CPU's COULD be potentially much faster in clock speed with this decrease in processing time across the registers. However, this could be a stretch, opinions?",7,0

Now on to bad stuff . So basically my first semester of college was a literal shit show I was raped, physically assaulted by my roommate and of course cherry on top I was hospitalized during midterms and then after that I burned my arm accidentally with an Iron right before finals. Second semester I was medically recovering and pursuing a rape case at the same time all while taking 17 credits per semester. My GPA is a 2.774 which is a trash GPA .Now I've pushed through all this drama despite professors telling me drop their class and just medically withdraw because frankly I love computer science . I genuinely do with all my heart. But as I'm doing summer it's clear I'm not ok I'm preforming at half my capacity and like I'm fine in the sense that I'm not suicidal but I do have ptsd regarding my college campus. I'm doing summer to recover my GPA to 3.0 so I can retain my scholarships. 

Now onto my question are there any fall internships I could apply to cus I need a break and wanna get away from college for a while. Sitting at home would drive me crazy, and my parents and I constantly argue as mental health is kinda a myth for them. Do companies care about what I went through?

The tutor was able to explain the project and walk through it with me. Tbh, the project seems way to advanced for my class.

Hi,  I've recently started learning Deep learning &amp; Tensorflow, and did some  online certifications, and the subject is so interesting as well as I'm  confident enough  that I wanna shift my career into ML/AI stuff. I'm  currently working on middleware tech, hence the shift is substantial.

Keeping  aside the core deep learning stuff, what I see as a pre requisite to  get into the big companies is a thorough knowledge on Data Structures  and Algorithms. I'm decently good at programming in Java &amp; Python,  but not much idea on the DS &amp; Algorthims apart from the basic  maps/queues/arrays. So If I wanna start fresh and learn DS &amp; Alg  thoroughly, what should be my best path to learn?

I  did some search and see books like 'Cracking the Coding Interview' or  websites like geeks4geeks or hackerank aimed at cracking interviews .  However for knowledge and thorough understanding, I'm thinking of  getting good at basics and then work on that book/websites. I did some  search and see Stanford Algorithms Specialization on Coursera to be  good. I started with the course, the instructor is great, but it seemed  like it is very indepth w.r.t. the subject. My aim at learning  algorithms is mainly to crack interviews - Im' open to learn whatever is  required for this

What  do you advice? Which course would you suggest that helps me with so  much info that I can crack, but at the same time don't go too indepth so  I need to spend a lot of time. I'm paralelly working on tensorflow and  DL, hence time is precious at this point for me.

I  also appreciate your recommendation to a complete different learning  path (rather than these books/site) to get thorough with the topics.",3,13

I would like to use my free time to learn something useful for my field or to work on my own smaller project. Because of not having much experience in the field, I can hardly come with some great ideas for a small project. 

I can programme in Python, Java, C++. I've got some basic knowledge about AI (e.g. CSP, MDP), machine learning (e.g. SVM, Adaboost). 

I would like to learn maybe something more about multiagent systems or some advanced algorithms and data structures. I would also like to get some experience in using neural networks. None of that is necessary. Maybe you might have a better idea.

Are there any great rather cheaper courses (doesn't have to be completely free)? Would you have any ideas for a smaller project? It doesn't have to be something completely new, I just want to use my theoretical knowledge in practice or to learn new things. What would you recommend me to do?

Join and help out!,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/c4npgb/new_programming_language_in_design_join_and_help/,sagecode,1561382360,"I believe that we need a new programming language for Computer Science: easy to teach and fun to use. I found existing programming languages difficult to grasp. Therefore we have young adults straggling, dropping out from school or  loosing enthusiasm and giving up. Unfortunately new programming languages are aiming for purity, performance, safety or distributed computing but not for ergonomic and readability. 

I have study 24 traditional programming languages and many new programming languages before starting this project. None of them is realizing these necessary goals: To be easy to grok, easy to read and comprehensive. I think there is huge value in this kind of language. Does not has to be pure nor super fast. It can be only 10x faster than Python and that is good enough if we also achieve better maintainability.

So my new language is called Bee. It is using special Unicode symbols for arithmetic expressions: ""                       "". This makes the source code more elegant but require a programmable keyboard. I think a serious developer or gamer can afford to invest into one.

One distinguish feature of Bee language is its ability to use subscript, superscript and Greek alphabet:  For example x is recognized as power(x). In some mathematical formulas: x and x  or  {           } are all valid identifiers. There are other languages who accept Unicode like: Julia

Bee is extremely readable due to its structured syntax. It uses English keywords that can be combined to create imperative statements. It has simple statements, conditional statements, block statements and repetitive statements. It is not a curly bracket language like C or Java. 

Bee is going to be an efficient language. This is more an implementation issue, but also a design issue. To enable efficient implementation Bee is more restrictive than Python. It uses static and native types compatible with C and OS. Making Bee a statically typed language is a hard choice but necessary for achieving higher performance.

If you have read all this, congratulation because you are definitely a special person looking into things. You can follow Bee evolution on sub-reddit channel or Twitter.  I will post often and also listen to suggestions. This project is open source and open design, so you are welcome to contribute:

I have a system that has a central ""master"" and multiple ""nodes"" that can be on the same network or remote. Nodes can communicate directly to each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

`+------+`

`|      |`

`+----&gt;+ Node |`

`|     |      |`

`|     +--+---+`

`|        ^`

`| Master +-----+----&gt;+ Node |`

`|        |     |     |      |`

`+--------+     |     +--+---+`

`|        ^`

`|        |`

`|     +--+---+`

`|     |      |`

`+----&gt;+ Node |`

`|      |`

`+------+`

&amp;#x200B;

The master is supposed to send a command to all nodes that tells them that they are allowed to communicte with each other from now on. Naturally, it may happen that a node A receives this command much earlier than other nodes. If A then tries to communicate with nodes that have not yet received the start command, A's communicate might get dropped. Is there are way to have all nodes be ""started"" at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

One solution I come up with exploits the fact that all nodes might fall into two categories:

1. nodes that only reply to requests from other nodes
2. nodes that send requests to other nodes (and reply to requests from other nodes)

In that case the master could start all nodes from categoy 1 first. If all nodes from category 1 are started, it starts all nodes from category 2. The problem with this solution is that I do not think it solves the problem in all cases. If I have multiple nodes in category 2, the problems still exists within the nodes in category 2.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that this might be related to ""consensus"", as I want all my nodes to reach consensus on a global state (""started""). But consensus algorithms don't seem to be too interested in reaching consensus at exactly the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a clean catch all solution to this?

I just graduated HS and next year will be major in computer science. I have taken a few CS classes in highschool. 

One of my CS teachers that I took at a local community college happens to be a business owner and I found out later that he teaches as a hobby. He told me many times that I was his favorite student (haha) and he really liked me in class. A few weeks ago, I emailed him and asked if there was any possibility of me working for him as an intern.

To make a long story short, he said yes and I begin my internship next week. 

His company focuses on IoT devices (b2b company that builds boards, chips, and software for other companies to use). He also told me that I am going to be working with 5G for a large part of my job, and using it on new chips. (I will be using some JS and other languages too // not too sure what that means yet). 

So this is all really cool and will be super valuable experience for me, my questions are:

=1= Will this internship help me for future internships given I put it on my resume?

=2= What should the most valuable thing for me to learn while here?

Thanks so much.",7,4

in other words, my computer currently is running DDR3, would DDR3L be compatible or would the machine not adjust the voltage of its signals?

Hi, I transferred to a 4 year university from a community college 2 years ago. At the time of transfer my interest in comp sci grew and I made the switch into math-CompSci major from math-econ major. I have one more academic year to graduate.

I was not very good in the beginning(am still not, long way to go) and I had to take beginners courses that were not so beginner friendly. Long story short, Iam so far surviving and have gotten myself an internship for current summer.

Since I switched, with little no previous experience and knowledge in computer science,  I first did not know how to prepare for internships, write resumes, look for projects to work on etc. Despite my skill level not being that great, compared to most students, I somehow landed an internship with a defense affiliated organization.

However it's mostly hardware. Therefore, there aren't many purely software related projects and my supervisor/mentor was on a leave for a week, while him being a mechanical engineer.

Despite that, I tried to talk to as many people here as I can in order to be involved. So I got myself to assist a project with python gui related component and my supervisor came back but hes assigning me stuff to do with matlab. Mostly file reading data analyzing script programs I'll start to work on.

I'm still grateful that I have an internship but I'm still worried this internship program isn't rigorous enough in terms of pure software engineering perspective 

From my school, my friends who have internships tell me they have mentors that also teach them a bit while they're involved in some really rigorous projects in software engineering

I have one more year to go and I can probably be a full time summer intern one more time, before I graduate. I'll have couple of group projects I worked on and one internship on my resume(this is my first one)

I'm worried.",4,1

I graduated recently, in May 2019 with a degree in computer science. I am now a data analyst. I've been working for this company as a student co-op since January 2018. I switched to a different co-op position in the same company in December 2018, because it would lead me to the full time job I have now. In that co-op position, I was doing the exact same thing I do now as a data analyst. I was working 40 hours too, I just wasn't an official full-time employee because I hadn't graduated yet. So while I've been doing work as a data analyst 40 hours a week for the past 7 months now (I mostly did web development before that, in my old position), I've only officially been a full time employee for a month.

I am making 62k/year on salary. In Detroit. However, I also get overtime pay. I figure that's not terrible for someone who just graduated.

But the problem is, the job is simply unfulfilling to me. Primarily, I write a lot of SQL and I create reports in Power BI. This was cool at first, and my SQL skills are very good now. But it's just too simple for me. I do write PHP scripts occasionally, which I run on a regular basis using cron jobs to move data from one database to another and what not.

Lately I've also been doing other random things that are needed. I've made an app in Microsoft PowerApps, but obviously that's just as unfulfilling as using Power BI.

I've also been doing a bit of web development stuff. However, I have recently been informed that my company will be shutting down all of our Linux servers which I use for my sites. They are trying to phase out PHP completely, because our IT department doesn't have the skillset to support it. They want us to use tools in the cloud, such as power BI and power apps. The problem is that these tools don't have the power to do some things that I need to do. I'm not sure what the solution to that problem will be once the servers are shut down.

I should also note that I do almost all of my work by myself. I am not part of the IT department. And this is not a small company FYI, it is a fortune 500 company.

Everyone who works here says to stay with this company. They all love it. But the problem is, we're basically in the Stone age when it comes to technology. They just want to outsource any software dev-related things to third-party companies. We have no developers here.

I've been told they do not pay people in IT very well.

I want more programming in my life, honestly. I need something far more complex than simply writing SQL and creating power BI reports that almost no one even cares to use. Everyone hates technology in this company, because the vast majority of them are between the ages of 50 and 65, and they hate computers in general.

I want to be working somewhere where technology really is the focus. I want to be able to work with a knowledgeable team of developers, where I will be able to learn from people who have been in the field for years. I want to be able to work on state-of-the-art technology, not just making reports and simple data entry apps. I also want to be paid more (currently making 62k and have 103k in student debt--not a great ratio).

The problem I'm seeing here is I just don't know if I should leave my first official full time job so fast. Would that be a bad idea? I feel like companies will just view me as an unstable job-hopper. That's why I've been thinking about staying here until I get my Master's degree (this company will pay for most of that, by the way) but I just don't know. Simultaneously, I feel like I could be getting a much better experience somewhere else.

If anyone could give me their thoughts on this, I would appreciate it. Do I stay here until I get my Master's, and then leave? Do I leave now? I don't know.",14,1

* And increases ROI per development.

People say you should keep those type of people around you to help you do better but I only feel worse. I'm stupid for no reason. I can't get my shit together. My therapist diagnosed me with generalized anxiety and depression. Medicine isn't working at all. 

I started community college in 2017. Biology was my first major in all of freshmen year and switched majors at the end of that summer. I didn't do so well in the math area because it's just never interested me and I could barely focus on it enough to study. I still tried and had to retake it ( a lot ugh) and finally passed with a c this spring. I had orientation at my state college, which is a pretty good college. I don't know why I'm shocked but, I found out that I'd have to spend 2 extra years in school just to take the computer courses with a BA, or three and a half years for a BS in computer science due to three extra math classes that I'm missing. My advisor stated that I can't start computer courses until math is completed. The electives are all completed and it's quite obvious by my academic record that I only do well in English, Psychology, and History and Biology.

I come from a low income household and cc was supposed to be my way of making funds easier on myself and my family, but I didn't take advantage of that. In the back of my head, a voice is telling me to major in English, even though I don't like writing much, I fill most of the course requirements for English. However, timing and money is not on my side. I can't work study for any comp sci programs until I do some of the computer classes, so there's really no point in enrolling for university anyway. I won't be able to reap the benefits of going to a four year. The last point leads me to my next thought, I should just stay in cc and enroll in uni in spring. I'll be wasting $8,328 just doing ONE math class and three electives for the fall.

I am  from india . I love computer science a lot . I joined a college here and choose cs as a major thinking i would learn a lot. Realized no one here is interested in computer science , all have joined this major thinking only about money . Hence people around me are just mugging up to pass the exams or just memorizing topics that are considered hot ones of this time . I went to professors  to help me make a project and after talking to them (at least 15 of them )realised they have absolutely no programming experience . So i started bunking classes and taught myself about everything from the absolute basics (Nand to tetris ) . Learnt to code simple servers . Made a simple application that would send a text message to me whenever someone logs in to my pc .Made a somewhat guessing game for ios . Started learning about electronics and i am planing to build a device . Learnt about how businesses work.

learnt web programming and now i am learning mathematics so that i can implement machine learning into my projects .

After passing out from indian colleges majority of students end up as bad coders and are referred as CODE MONKEYS by americans who happen to outsource their work to india because of cheap labour . Also i see that indian coders do not focus on quality and just get the work done .

Currently do mobile forensics and finding that just using the tools we have isn't cutting it anymore.  Decided to go back for a Masters in Computer Science and doing the pre-reqs for it now.  Have written programs and scripts in Python and I have some knowledge of Java along with C++.

So I'm currently taking Assembly and Data Structures.  In Assembly, I have been doing well as it's all practical and we're learning the language itself.  Only program I had issues with ended up being related to Data Structures and dealt with sorting.

In Data Structures I didn't do great on the first test (we have three total), but up until two assignments ago I had gotten a 100 on all of them.  We're using C++, which I'm familiar with, but isn't something I know.  Admittedly, I got a 50 on the sorting homework, largely because I things I forgot or didn't properly put into the program (I would contend it does work per the requirements, but again I messed up the implementation).

I don't love data structures and up until now hadn't really have used them for programs I have written.  Should I be concerned or will gritting through the next month be alright until I progress further?",0,1

That being said, I still enjoy the theory behind civil engineering and the type of analysis we perform. When I was in graduate school I did a substantial amount of programming in matlab. I mostly did numerical methods (FEA, DEM, Monte Carlo), which gave me some experience with coding and I really enjoyed it.

I'm a white kid from Kentucky going to an instate school. I'm not a minority of any kind so that marks me off the list for a lot of scholarships.

I am however extremely broke, and my sister is going to college at the same time.

I found out today I'm going to have to take out an absurd amount of loans from university. If I have to take out this much for four years I see no other option but to switch to a cheaper school. Which I really do not want to do because I love my university and its CS/Engineering program. And I also have the amazing opportunity to work as a student developer despite the fact I haven't even started my freshman year yet.

Some things that I think would make me stand out however:
I'm 18, haven't even started my freshman year of college yet, and I've already started paid work as a Student Developer at my school. I've also previously worked as an unpaid research assistant in bioinformatics and before that an unpaid intern as a web developer for a non profit.

I spend as much time as I can manage working on personal project. I've built bots, websites, webscrapers, web apps, tinkered with electronics.

I'm going to be a part of the Association of Computing Machinery, and a club at my school that builds a solar car for racing. 

I love this field, I can show I love this field. I'm in no way here for money. I've worked in this field unpaid before. I'm here for the love of programming and computer.
