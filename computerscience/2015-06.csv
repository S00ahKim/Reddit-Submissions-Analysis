Now I don't want to bore you with a sad story to make you feel sympathy for me and want to help, but I feel some aspects should be highlighted to explain my situation. I'm currently suspended from my program at Carleton University in Canada. I was originally enrolled in Computer Science: Video Game Development but due to a devastating lack of motivation that has been with me ever since I was in grade seven I found myself falling short. I became all too comfortable with plagiarism and thus ended up falling behind because I never learned any of the things I needed to so come exam time I was crushed. In all honesty I'm afraid. Scared that I fucked up too much this time to recover, so here I am. No I'm not here to beg for handouts, no I'm not here to hear someone try to comfort me telling me to just chin up and get through it. What I'm here for is advice. This suspension is my wake up call and I need to do something about it. I need to learn to become a proper computer scientist in the span of 8 months so I can prove to myself its worth staying in my degree. I have no support from my family as my mom and I are a low-income house hold. I work a dead end part time job where the hours are pitiful and I'm struggling to pay my rent, student loans are out of the question as I've lost my full time student status as I am only eligible to take two electives per semester for a year. I need resources to learn from, I need drive and motivation so I don't fail again. I need hope. I come here asking for you, bright and intelligent computer scientists who know the ropes to guide me, tell me what I need to do, what online credentials I can obtain, anything and everything so that I don't fail. My knowledge in programming is very limited, I understand the basics of many languages but my application skills are horrendous, which intimidates me when I'm looking for a job so I can cover my ass for the 8 months that I don't have full proper classes.

Lastly, I'd like to apologize for being this pathetic and not having any control in my own god damn life. I just need help. I don't want to be like this anymore.",6,0

(I will link the thread below in the comments.) I wanted to follow up and ask, how are all we doing?

The goals I had set for myself were, ""get my GitHub poppin' (so in other words: upload my best content) and code at least 4 days a week. I am taking Assembly Language over the summer, but I also want to self-teach PHP, Java, and then see what else I might have time for."" Regarding my own progress, I confess I have not worked on my Github even once. I have been travelling tons (trying to see family and long-distance friends before summer school starts next week), working really hard to organize my entire apartment (after reading Marie Kondo's book, lol), catching up on recreational reading, starting a new fitness regime, doing some light programming (mainly C#) --- but I have not come anywhere close to the 4-days-a-week goal I declared last month. Additionally, I have not worked on any new languages. Now that I've had some time to ""enjoy summer"" (which is good for morale), I am ready to buckle down and either A) make my original goals happen, or B) adjust/replace my original goals, and make those happen. This Monday, I am beginning my Assembly Language course. My plan is to schedule class time and study time, as well as to schedule time for my other goals --- essentially, set up a weekly schedule Monday-Friday comparable to what a regular semester would look like. My plan is to post this schedule up where I will see it every day, as well as to pull back out my dayplanner (which I never let go of during the school year, but has been abandoned since school ended --- I know a lot of people keep an electronic planner, but the pen &amp; paper method has always worked best for me when I'm making to-do lists, etc..).

Let's say I have three locations, Alice and Bob (end users) and Eve (relay server). Alice wants to encrypt a message twice(?), and maybe also send a digital signature, so that when Alice sends a message, Eve is able to decode half of it, and then when it reaches Bob, Bob is able to decode the other half without Eve ever knowing the contents of the message, but still knowing that it came from Alice. Accordingly, data going in and out of Eve should look different to eavesdroppers.

If I want to create a system that functions like this, do I have to write my own cryptographic algorithm? Or can I use libraries that implement pre-existing encryption algorithms and just encrypt it twice?

So the 1 dimensional variant would be a hash table where all keys within y distance from the key would be returned.

having stored these values:

Key | Data
---|---
1 | 2
3 | 7
5 | 0
7 | 1
12 | 0

a request of (key: 5, distance: 2) would return 7, 0, and 1 (the key 5 has the keys 3,5, and 7 within it's distance and those key's values are returned).

the tricky bit is that the distance for the first pass of the usage will remain constant, but later usages will probably have the distance become variable.

Further, I need to extend the key into a multidimensional key. The key vector size will be application specific but i would rather not hard code the data structure per key width.

Any suggestions? It's an interesting twist addition to the hash table, I truly don't think the hash table would work for this.

I will need to do deletion and insertion on a *very* regular basis. in fact, every request will result in the item being deleted and reinserted with a slightly modified key.",4,1

Another reason I want to learn C is because I eventually want to program and design an operating system from scratch in C and Assembly and I figured I'd need to be a master to do that (but that's irrelevant).

Anyways, what's the best way to methodically study and learn the C programming language (the latest version, not K&amp;R or ANSI)?

I'm a mathematics student and while studying sorting algorithms I stumbled upon [this](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/) site. At the bottom of the page it says

&gt; The ideal sorting algorithm would have the following properties:

&gt; * Stable: Equal keys aren't reordered.
&gt; * Operates in place, requiring O(1) extra space.
&gt; * Worst-case O(nlg(n)) key comparisons.
&gt; * Worst-case O(n) swaps.
&gt; * Adaptive: Speeds up to O(n) when data is nearly sorted or when there are few unique keys.
&gt; 
There is no algorithm that has all of these properties, and so the choice of sorting algorithm depends on the application.

From what I understand, hashing is devising an ideally unique number of a certain key, and placing that key in an array in the index of that 'unique' number. Of course, it's impossible as far as I'm concerned to make that number truly unique, but Universal Hashing seems to be a method of reducing the number of collisions. From what I understand from the lecture, Universal Hashing requires a set of hashing functions, and upon each hash, the hashing algorithm is randomly chosen. I understand from that point why the number of collisions is reduced, but what I don't understand is how this method is convenient for searching, inserting, or deleting. If the hash function is randomly chosen, how is there any guarantee that hashing the same key again (for searching, for example), will produce the same hash value? It would be likely that most times you hash the same thing, the hash function is different if chosen randomly. Doesn't that not only make the hash table inconvenient, but useless?

It seems to me like a simple fix would be some setting you can turn on that allows ONLY the country you're in to login, so that for example, if someone from China even tried resetting my password it'd say something like, ""This country is not associated with this account.""

Is there any reason why this doesn't already exist? And if not, someone pass it along to their higher-ups and get it implemented.

Edit: If you forget to turn it off?

&gt; if it was implemented with Gmail, you're likely receiving boarding pass emails if you are traveling abroad through your Gmail account, and it's already picking up on that/putting stuff in your calendar. If this security feature existed, it could also remind you, ""Hey you have your account restricted to USA only, would you like to add France (or whatever country you're going to)?""
