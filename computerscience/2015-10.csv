I've taken Coursera and Udacity coursework and with self-discipline (i.e. not just gaming the class just to make yourself feel like you accomplished something) and actually putting in the effort to read and go through the course material, then it seems comparable to a lot of what is learned in a degree program.

Any serious interview will want to see what code you've written and almost certainly give you a coding test.  

I do think that the Computer Science degree programs are some of the most valuable but that's if you're going to get a degree.  I'm not sure whether it's really any value added or if it's just a getting the piece of paper and a sense of self-accomplishment.

The test reports are titled uniformly TEST[testnumber].pdf, so they're easily findable, and their structure is title page &gt; table of contents &gt; abstract &gt; body.

&amp;nbsp;

But obviously unless you know of the tests, it's hard to know what each one deals with. To make these tests more easily searchable by everybody, we need to somehow extract the title and the abstract of each test and put into one document.

&amp;nbsp;

I had some ideas on a process, but I'm not sure how easy or even possible it would be to implement. Three off the top of my head:

* Find all PDFs titled TEST[testnumber].pdf &gt; extract Page 1 &amp; Page with word ""Abstract"" &gt; save new PDF &gt; merge all PDFs generated

* Find all PDFs titled TEST[testnumber].pdf &gt; screen shot Page 1 &amp; Page with word ""Abstract"" &gt; OCR pages &gt; merge OCR result into text file

* Find all PDFs titled TEST[testnumber].pdf &gt; copy unformated text in pages 1-10 &gt; merge into text file


Obviously very similar ideas, I'm just mentioning all of them in case maybe batch extracting PDF pages isn't possible but batch screenshotting is, as an example.

During these years even though I had other self esteem issues regarding social skills I was always confident that I am capable of pursuing my dreams in life. It also helped boost my confidence that I got a higher achiever's award. Only 7 from my entire grade got this.

After Ordinary Levels I started doing Advanced Levels where I chose Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Core Maths. After a few months my confidence vanished. A Levels was insanely hard compared to O Levels. I found that  some students managed to get decent grades with moderate effort. Some quit science altogether. However, with 6 hours sleep and studying in most of my waking hours I managed to get 3A's and a B. It takes me longer to learn something that others. I had to practice something more. After the end of those 2 years I was so exhausted that I gave up science.

I saw how my peers doing commerce put less effort and yet gained good grades. So, I thought that I am not smart enough for science and got to university to do an accounting degree.

This was far more easier than science. I had free time to do other things in life. However, I felt that something is missing in me. I envied those who say they enjoyed their jobs. Because I knew that accounting will just be a job for me. I won't enjoy doing it.  Science is where my passions lie. 

Then I read about deliberate practice and how average students get to grades using learning techniques. books - [Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How. eBook: Daniel Coyle:](http://www.amazon.com.au/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown-ebook/dp/B0026OR1UK) 
[So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://www.booktopia.com.au/so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-cal-newport/prod9781455509126.html?source=pla&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwqNiwBRDnq93MioaqtKQBEiQAb7Ezn7lW3TIDRvzBQyPZ6cOxRsJicvv3btcrcmKgw6g27QAaAh608P8HAQ)

So, I transferred to do computer science. The first semester was very hard for me. Specially because I take longer to remember things than others and there is lot to learn in the short time span. I vigorously used anki to study but still found it difficult. Again my social life is terrible and having depression doesn't help it either.

I have thoughts about going back to do accounting. I will have a more balanced existence, good social life and will enjoy my  university experience. But, I'll have to bury my lifelong science dreams and settle for a job that pays the bills.   And I am not sure if I will regret it in the future. Lots of people do in forums. They wish they had done the course they were passionate in even though it was harder. If you could go back, would you major in accounting again?

    Prove 5 is O(1)

How do you go about this? I understand that choosing constants *c* and *n^0*

I guess the questions are:

1. What is an example of the definitions in action?

2. What'd be the step-by-step approach of solving the question above?

3. Are there any limits to the values of *c* and *n^0*

But she insisted it was O(n), _because_ it scaled linearly with the _number of digits_ (note that she was convinced that n should have been the _number of digits_ and not the _number itself_, and wouldn't budge from her opinion. It seems really weird to me that you would treat n as anything but the _main input of the program_).

I looked it up online but I can't quite find anything on the subject. I asked my mother (software engineer) and she agreed with me. Can any of you explain to me who's right here?

I'm in my third year of mechanical engineering and we have to make our final year project, so this is what i want to go with and advices would be really great from anyone in robotics or computer sciences around here!
To sum up my aim is this:  
""To investigate computer vision and its potential and apply it. To build two devices:  
1. One wore by the user, which can detect, recognize and send signals to the recognized device indicated by users gaze.  

2. One that can receive signals from the first one and activate or deactivate when recognized.""  

The wearable device will have two cameras: an infrared one to track user's pupil position and one pointed at what the user is looking at. The second sensor will send images to a computer which, using OCR algorithms, will look for a known symbol (the symbol will be printed on a piece of paper attached to the device i want to activate). The sent picture will be cropped depending on user's gaze so the computer will have less pixels to work on to. If a known symbol gets recognized the computer will send a symbol to the ""robot"" which will activate or deactivate.  

I'm not really sure which one would be the best board to use for such devices and not still sure of what programming language i should go with. Matlab would be ideal but, as i heard, gives lots of problems with both arduino and RBp.  

any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance to everyone!",4,2

Suppose that, given a string of binary data of length n to be compressed:
Build a binary tree of depth n, marking the left branch as 0, and the right branch as 1 at each node.
Traverse the binary tree according to the data, i.e. for 0110, traverse the tree left-right-right-left.
Mark each of the leaf nodes 1...2^n.
Write down the leaf number (0110 would be leaf 7 of 16).

If you send this number, as well as the size of the data, to a receiver. It would be possible for the receiver to recreate the tree and traverse the tree to the top, thereby recovering the original data.

With large data sets, the leaf number will start getting massive, so you could save space by representing this number as (a^b)+c.

After doing a bit of math I think that its probably not useful for any kind of data compression, but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.

I'm a high school junior who has been interested in computers, programming, and electronics for years. A few years ago I got my amateur radio license and have been very active with ham radio and electronics. However, I've also done a fair amount of programming (web dev and desktop applications). I have a few projects on my github, but have been slacking lately. I attempted to self-study AP Computer Science last year a sophomore using an online course as well as Barron's latest AP CS book (used this book close to the test date). I ended up getting a 1... I had been studying computer science previously for a few years and have a good understanding of certain principles, but I had never really gone in depth with Java so I think that hurt me a good bit.

Anyway, I have plans to retake the AP CS test this year (but it's always possible that I could do it my senior year). The thing is, I am feeling no motivation at all to do this online course. My school has a CS class going on, but I didn't apply for it because it's for a new AP CS test that is in two years and I knew it would be a waste of my time anyway. I'm only doing 1 AP this year, but my schedule is full again. Also, I can tell you that my brain does seem to excel in English and my writing skills are nice. But, I also have a passion for technology and science. I do well in school, but I'm not the best in math/science because of test grades. Therefore, I'm not in the most advanced classes like everyone else. I like the idea of programming and would like to be good at it, but I have no mentors and I just don't have the self-motivation. I've been thinking about EE and Computer Engineering more lately. What do you think? Should I be worried? How should I prepare for this AP CS test?",29,0

You are asked to develop an application to calculate savings for a number of time periods. Assume in the beginning of each month the user plans to save x amount of dollars to the investment account that pays r % of annual interest compounded monthly. (To find monthly rate you should divide annual rate by 12 months). Your application should take as inputs monthly payment (the amount user intends to save each month), and the annual rate (as percent). When the user clicks next month button, the program should calculate the new balance, and display the number of months passed. Initially, the balance is zero, and number of months is also 0. Refer to figures below for the interface design.

**Brace yourselves, this is a long one**


If you search ""good art"" on google, you get terrible generic art. It's kind of basic knowledge on the internet that your search can't be that wide, and I'd never really actually searched good art to find good art, but I've felt like that at times. I try hard to find good art elsewhere, and slowly I've developed a more effective method to find really good art. But now I need to upgrade the method.

I'm an artist. A writer, director. I know that [everything is a remix](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) (required watching for any creative, or human really), what makes a good remix: many sources, perfect technical skill, what makes a bad remix: few sources, poor technical skill. A child never writes his own alphabet. Everything you are, is picked up from your environment. When did you learn your native language? Was it February the 1st? No ""googoo, gaga, mama, dada, car, cow"" and gradually it builds up.

 A ""genius"" is a person who has been exposed to many different systems and therefore can come up with a wide variety of solutions. Leonardo Da Vinci, you think he just evolved out of nothing? He spoke to people that were interested in mechanics in his time, they gathered, they share ideas *but you only hear of Da Vinci.* Guys like Nikola Tesla, Edison, all the great innovators of the past have been influenced by other people, and the mythical structures that we build around inventors that they inherit special abilities, they are geniuses or they're ""in tune with the infinite mind and the idea somehow filtered in"" - well this is the kind of nonsense that's the same story about ""Is there intelligent life out there?"" The real question is is there intelligent life *down here.* I don't think so, I'm serious. What is intelligence? The ability to reason things out? You can't have that ability unless you've had experience. Mystery breeds myth, and when people don't understand how something works, they start making up stories on how it works.

 An eskimo never dreams of walking on a palm-fringed beach. Do you understand that? It is not possible, unless he's seen motion pictures, or something about the beach. It is not possible for any human being to build a frame of reference of any kind without experience. I know where every artwork I ever made came from, I know the influence, the books I've read, the people I've known, everything that shaped those values. And sometimes people say ""Well when did you think of that wonderful idea? Was it September 2nd?"" No it's cumulative bits of information, that we put together with experience.

There was an article written called: [""Why We Love Music?""](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_we_love_music) It explains where taste comes from. Taste, in my opinion, is what makes us unique, not ""inner selves"" we can extract something from. You cannot extract anything from a mind that has no frame of reference. 

&gt; In one study, neuroscientists introduced different styles of songs to people and monitored brain activity. They found that music impacts many centers of the brain simultaneously; but, somewhat surprisingly, each style of music made its own pattern, with uptempo songs creating one kind of pattern, slower songs creating another, lyrical songs creating another, and so on. Even if people didnt like the songs or didnt have a lot of musical expertise, their brains still looked surprisingly similar to the brains of people who did.
But if our brains all synch up when we hear the same basic dynamic differences in music, why dont we all respond with the same pleasure?
Large, like Salimpoor, says that this difference in preference is due to how our neurons are wired together, which in turn is based on our own, personal history of listening to or performing music. Rhythm is all about predictability, he says, and our predictions about music start forming from a pretty early age onward. He points to the work of Erin Hannon at the University of Nevada who found that babies as young as 8 months old already tune into the rhythms of the music from their own cultural environment.



I think it goes deeper than that. I think that period from 0 - 10 years of age, the experiences you have, the films you watch, the music you listen to, and the peaks and details of the peaks of those experiences mesh together into 80 billion neurons making your own fingerprint of taste with all sorts of areas to combine. Looking at a new piece of art can combine two connections in your brain and offer a new kind of ecstasy. This is simply speculation based on experience, I can't say I actually know for sure. 

With that idea in mind, I like to go out and search for as much art as possible. I look for as many movies, books, music, experimental electroacoustic music, fine art photography, interior design, architecture, fashion, furniture, actors, models, etc. 

Over the years I've developed a method to make my search a little more efficient. I've been searching for 2 years. My work has intensified ten fold and I've been enveloped in ecstasy. The feeling is more intense than anything I've ever felt before. 

The method goes something like this (say I'm looking through fine art photography): 

1. Find an artist (lets say Wolfgang Tillmans) 

2. Look through their bio and check the galleries they've attended 

3. Open those galleries websites, and look through their artists until I find an artist I like, and repeat.  

I've developed other 'techniques' like when I find a fine art photobook I like, I search the name and author on Google, and go to images, and keep scrolling until I find something interesting. This helps me find other distributors of art books, producers, etc. Basically the goal here is to find more ponds to dive in. 

Some auction websites like artsy.net, and mutualart can be helpful. Niche book publishers, or shops are helpful in finding photobooks like Dashwood Bookstore, or larsmullerpublishers, or hatjecantz. Big ones like Phaidon can also be helpful to sift through. For films, sites like Fandor, Twitchfilm, and other similar ones update you on the latest internationally - though I don't think they're efficient in curation. Sometimes I skim Criterion for old movies I hadn't seen yet. Lots of classics, but some obscure unknown films too.

At times I'd check out recommendation sites, and sometimes they can be helpful. Things like Pandora, Spotify, Rdio, gnoosic, or gnovies. Or Tastekid. But believe it or not those things turn stale after a while. They start recommending you the same stuff because you still like the same stuff. They don't give you recommendations based on the way your neurons are wired, they give you recommendations based on what you linked them to. And sometimes they are very poor recommendations, simply because they fit in a genre, or category. Because of this I feel that there might be clusters of neurons that offer ecstasy that have not been and cannot be explored, or new combinations of art that can stimulate those neurons along with other previously stimulated ones to create a new sensation. This is why recommendations are such a weak device for discovery. They don't allow you to explore beyond a certain pond of art, and sometimes, in fact most times that is absolutely necessary. 

Lately though, I haven't been finding these gems as often as I want. I've entered a sort of lull in my search. 

This is why I've come here to * superman voice * *REDDIT!* to help me with my search. 

A couple of months back I asked a neuroscience subreddit if it was possible to sort of scan the brain and find out the way the brains neurons are connected, and convert that to images or sound that stimulate those neurons. Someone told me that isn't possible with todays technology, he'd literally have to slice my brain open, and even then it wouldn't really be accurate.

 Though I've heard of experiments where scientists have been able to scan people dreaming and hook that up to a google image search that can compile together what the dreams look like based on what neurons were firing. 

There was also a product designed to change your mood. A kind of electronic device you stick to your forehead that goes around your head that stimulates your neurons to make you more energized, or help you calm down. 

This is why I think there might be a way to do this. 


But after that mammoth of a post, here's my question: how can I make my search for art and finding the gems more efficient? How can I find the gems faster?

Let me clarify what I mean by *gem.* A gem is a piece of art that is so potent that it changes your life. It matures you as a human being and allows you to grow. It overrides all previous experiences in your life, complacency, plain pleasure, your existing state of mind on art and gives you an intense burst of entirely new (to you) information and sources, so strong it makes you ecstatic with a touch of sadness because you never know when you'll find something like it ever again in your life. Case in point: [Laurence Anyways.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YjIWEky81M) Oh and btw, a gem is completely subjective. 

**Can a software be programmed to read my neurons wiring** (and more than that, find art that aligns with two, three, four, or five different areas of neuron wiring simultaneously) **and search for art based on my taste?**

**If not, what are some ways I can enhance my search, from a scientific, mathematical perspective?**",5,4
165,2015-10-29,2015,10,29,9,3qmyh8,How introductory programming language guides are hurting and not helping people get involved in Computer Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/3qmyh8/how_introductory_programming_language_guides_are/,Deckard-Kane,1446078208,"Hello everyone!

This is my first time posting so I would like to start with a little about myself. I am a 3rd year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Interactive Media. Before college, I had never programmed before. I had an interest in computers and even got A+ Certified in computer repair in high school so I had a little more experience than your average computer user. But wow was computer science a whole other ballgame!

Computer science is such a unique subject because unless you have taken the time to research it yourself or you have taken a course in high school, you will probably know very little about programming. You can't really say that for many other subjects. For example, if you are a linguistics major, you probably have taken a foreign language course before. But it is not just possible, but very probable that you have never touched code before in your life before formally studying it. What I found in my freshman year was that my peers either had no experience like me or had an abundance of experience. No joke, one of my friends told me nonchalantly that he was the head of the computer science team at his high school and had been programming for 4 years already. Yikes! Was I supposed to have that experience? So I drove myself to make up for my knowledge by doing extra reading and outside work. I used the introductory guides and documentation for the programming language that we were learning (which was Racket).

If you have never used a programming language guide before then I will introduce you to the genre. It is a kind of textbook for learning the basics of a language. These usually come in many different forms from ""How to Java Program for Dummies!"" to online sites like W3Schools. For reference, I will be using http://www.cplusplus.com/files/tutorial.pdf (a C++ tutorial) and http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/intro.html (a Racket tutorial) as examples because they are guides I have used before and they are fairly official.

The most official tutorials are written by the team that wrote the language or the company that manages it. But because the web is so vast, there are plenty of other tutorials that are written by tutorial services or professors and teachers in the field. These guides usually have a similar format not matter where they came from. They start with the basics of the language by making the reader make a ""Hello World!"" program and then move on to data types, variables, methods, etc. until they get to more complex material like sorting algorithms and complex loops.

OK, so these guides must be a good way for new comers to catch up to more advanced students, right? Well, yes and no. As taken from the C++ guide, ""This tutorial is for those people who want to learn programming in C++ and do not necessarily have any previous
knowledge of other programming languages. Of course any knowledge of other programming languages or any general computer skill can be useful to better understand this tutorial, although it is not essential."" Right off the bat, this seems like a strange thing to say. Why are veteran programmers going to get more out of this than a novice? That seems like some backwards logic for an introductory guide for new users. These guides are also used by programmers as reference as well, so maybe it is fine that these guides might be a little bit technical. But sadly it quickly becomes clear why a veteran programmer would get more out of this guide than a novice: the guides use technical jargon to describe concepts. This is best shown with an example. The C++ tutorial begins like any other tutorial with a ""Hello World!"" program. It then goes on to describe all the parts of the simple program to the reader. OK, that's a good start! But the authors don't use simple explanations, but use the actual technical definitions. Like when the authors talk about what #include &lt;iostream&gt; means, they say ""Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are directives for the preprocessor. They are not regular code lines with expressions but indications for the compiler's preprocessor. In this case the directive #include &lt;iostream&gt; tells the preprocessor to include the iostream standard file."" What the hell is a preprocessor? What is a directive? What is a compiler? This is one of the first pages and I am already lost. This is not how you teach beginners the basics of a language. The authors don't even make an effort to explain the concepts either. He just threw it in there because that is the technical definition of what the #include &lt;iostream&gt; does even though a person not familiar with these terms would confused by them.

Another example comes from the Racket documentation. Under the section called ""11 Iterators and Comprehensions"" the author described for loops which, while a confusing topic to be sure, is made more confusing by the way he words it. He writes ""The for family of syntactic forms support iteration over sequences. Lists, vectors, strings, byte strings, input ports, and hash tables can all be used as sequences, and constructors like in-range offer even more kinds of sequences. Variants of for accumulate iteration results in different ways, but they all have the same syntactic shape."" I know what for loops are and know some Racket and I still had to read that a good 5 times before I fully understood it. Iterating is one of those words that makes sense to the writer and seems to be a perfect word for describing what a for loop does, but it is super confusing to a beginner. 

So it comes down to the question: Who are these guides for? The writers and my teachers who have assigned readings like these have said that they are for beginners. And yet they are written in a confusing way that uses technical jargon that only programmers would know. One of the major problems with modern computer science is that we are not attracting a diverse set of people. These guides are only exasperating that problem because someone who isn't already interested in CS would look at these beginner guides and become confused and not want to look further into CS.

The problem with teaching CS is that once you know it, you know it. You get past the threshold concepts of the course and then you understand how it works. This makes it hard to look back and see how beginners would get stuck on a concept because you so thoroughly understand it. But in order to make these guides more approachable, we need to explain them differently. We don't have to dumb down the content (we don't need to make baby's first programming guide because that would scare away programmers who are looking for a refresher on a language), we just need to choose our words more carefully with an audience in mind. So instead of saying ""A for loop is an iterator"" we need to say ""A for loop goes through a list, vector, or other set of elements in a row and does the action in the for loop for each element in the series until it meets the conditions to stop."" This might take longer, but it is worth it. It's about taking the extra time to adapt the information in the guides because once you get past the technical fluff, the information is still good! We need to stop making the introductory programming guide genre by programmers for programmers and instead make them by programmers for anyone.

Thank you for your time (I know it was a bit of a mouthful!) but I do think that these tutorials are the front line for making new programmers and the fact that we are confusing them and pushing them away with the way we write them makes me angry.

PS I know there may be guides out there that use less technical language, but because these are the official guides for these languages, I think they should set an example for usability.

I'll eventually (hopefully) be transferring to Rutgers. However, I started as the art degree since the courses were more to my taste/ability. My brother in law convinced me to switch to the science degree, saying that would make me more marketable (which is probably true) and that I shouldn't pick the easy way out. I figured he was right, so I switched and now I'm really struggling. I'm at community college now and the math department is woefully lacking in capable professors. I've always struggled with math and have to work harder at it, but now I'm finding it impossible to get the help I need to comprehend it. I also have to take physics III and IV, with no background in physics and, again, more math. It's not like this is ""I don't feel like doing it"", it's ""I've struggled with math since 6th grade and have retaken courses and wasted money on this"".

Basically, I don't think this is something I can continue to do. My GPA is suffering horribly because of it. I want to be a software engineer/do something with programming. My question is:
Would switching back to the bachelor's of art degree in CS hurt my marketability to companies looking to hire as opposed to the bachelor's of science?",21,10
