So some background, I am an
intermediate GNU/Linux and beginner BSD user (I am by NO means a super smart user, I ask questions and forget stuff ALL the time) and I know the basics of Python and am building on them as well as writing my first program. I started getting into computers when I was 12 (I am 17 now) back in 2013. I was gifted an old Toshiba laptop and installed Ubuntu 12.04 to it, this was my first computer ever and I have never used Microsoft Windows or MAC before.
I have known that I want to work in IT for a very long time and have narrowed it down to two specific feilds, computer science and computer engineering. I really want to be building computers and coding BiOS and firmware and really lower level stuff and working in that deep level of computing. This has become more and more what I want to do ever since I swapped from GNU/Linux to OpenBSD as my daily driver. I love the work people in that feild do and
all the knowledge you gain, but I also like some parts of making applications and operating systems like OpenBSD and the shells and TTYs and such. I am by no means an advanced programer or *NIX user, in the *NIX world I guess as a whole I am a beginner more twords intermediate and in programming definitley a noob. I am getting the ""Book of PF"" and am gonna use a rasberry pi to learn Firewalls and networking, I am building a desktop for my family which will run.... windows 10... So I will have a chance to work with that for the first time which will also allow me to start working twords an A+ certification as they require MS use (which makes the certs description a giant lie if I may add. Require specific software *which in turn require specific hardware* is not being non-biased). What I am wanting to ask here is this, does this show more interest in computer science of computer engineering? For
working in the field of building computers and making BiOS and such what languages and knowldge is most important? All help is loved and suggestions would be loved too. A lot of people are telling me that web dev is where it's
at and while it is an amazing feild, looking into it and even having done things like HTML and CSS and such, while fun... they're not what I wanna do to be honest. I don't see myself feeling happy and fufilled in that feild. Perhaps my conception of it is wrong, but I am just unsure. I hope advice from more expericned people will help.

So I am a 18 soon to be 19 year old guy who just graduated from high school, but is unfortunately starting college this years fall semester, so I'm delayed by a year. I want to major in Computer Science/Mechanical Engineering but suck REALLY badly at math. I am decent at basic algebra along with geometry, but I had such a terrible foundation in math, I practically feel useless if I ever went to a heavy math based field. My aspiration is to create things that are practical, and to understand robots/machines, how to develop them, and use them as a means of making a name for myself.

I've been out of highschool for a few months now, and since I am saving up money for the whole year for myself since I couldn't go into college due to my financial situation, I'm hoping I can teach myself the basics of robotics, electronics, or python. I know i seem like I'm juggling a bunch of goals and cramming it up to one, but I believe I should try to build a good foundation in math before I begin to go deep into it.


My question is, should I start self-teaching myself algebra-calculus by using apps like khan academy? Or could I simply start getting ahead by learning computer science by learning python or javascript?",5,1

I think it's so cool, and got thinking about practical applications for neural networks.

My understanding is that a neural network starts out with a fixed number of input neurons. In the video series, The input neurons represent the pixels of a 28x28 image that is a handwritten number. The amount of input neurons is the same.

I thought about recognizing all sorts of images, like images of animals. But not all images have the same width and height, and therefore there might be a different number of input neurons at the beginning of the network, if it works like it does in the videos linked above. Some are huge, and some are smaller. How does a neural network accommodate for this?

The same goes for voice transcription. Not all audio snippets are the same size. So how would a program learn to recognize words with a neural network when the input data comes in different sizes?

Or, is a neural network even the correct structure to use in these cases? What machine learning models work best for image or word recognition, when input sizes can vary?",3,1

I know its a good thing to have various skills learned when applying, but at what point should you decide to move on to next skill to put on a simple first time internship?

Fast forward to college, I was a CS major for 3 semesters. I excelled my first 2 semesters, mostly because it was stuff I had already learned or was familiar with in high school. 3rd semester, took a data structures class. Ended up understanding very little, got very behind in the course, even with the help of tutoring, I couldnt get the hang of abstract data types. To be fair, all of my professors were older men that werent very good at explaining things, that could have impeded me, or it could have just not been meant to be. Additionally, I was a superstar at math in high school, I rocked the AP Calc exam, but EVERY SINGLE math class I took in college were my worst grades by far. Same problem with teachers to me: professors werent helpful, couldnt help me when I struggled. 

Ended up switching my degree that semester, have a bachelors in liberal arts degree. I work in finance, and I enjoy my job, dont get me wrong. But Im starting to miss the collaboration with others and the tackling of big projects and the ecstatic feeling of finally having a working big ass chunk of code after hours of debugging and headache. Should I start to teach myself CS again? Note: in college I was busy with other classes, as well as being in ROTC at the time, but now all I do is work so I have free time after getting home. 

Im just caught up in my mind with the thought that I gave up on myself, or thinking CS just wasnt for me. It used to be my biggest passion, I had such big dreams for it, and I ended up being confused and frustrated by it, and I dont know if it was me or because of other factors. 

TL;DR I rocked CS in high school, sucked in college. Wasnt good at the math, couldnt get past data structures. Got a degree in liberal arts. Cant figure out if it was my own fault or the lack of help I had from teachers/lack of time I had to devote to it. I used to love it, I dont know if I gave up on my dream or if it just wasnt meant to be. Thinking about teaching myself again.

At the end of February, Ill be heading back to university for my next semester and two of my units are Data Structures and Abstractions (I think maybe this is algorithms?) and the other is Computer Graphics Principles and Programming. Ive heard that these two courses can be really tough from students, the professors (and r/programmerhumour!), so Im getting just a tiny bit nervous... 

I have emailed both professors for these units to ask them what to study over the break to prepare:
Data Structures advice: learn C++ over the break 
Computer Graphics: linked me to an online book called The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL. 

Ive been working through both of these suggestions (although, Im finding the OpenGL book a bit dry to read). 

These specific topics seem to be relatively common amongst CS degrees, so I thought I would ask if anyone has any experiences with these subjects that might suggest some alternative things to study? 
I have heard graphics units can be heavily mathematics related. Any mathematics topics you would recommend looking over? 

I have two more months to get some study (and relaxation) done. 

Here are the unit outlines:

What are your thoughts on this?

My personal reason for interest in this: I go to a pretty good state school and I am in a BA program for CS. The only big differences between the BS and BA at my school are the 4 semesters of foreign language requirement, a BA must minor, one or two less math classes, and BAs have their choice of upper level electives. The BS is ABET accredited, and the BA is not. I know some might think it's stupid, but I chose the BA because I wanted to minor in the language I grew up with (haven't had formal classes). I do love coding but (blasphemy!) I like other things too. 

Did I hurt my future career choices by doing this? I know that having a BA makes me look somewhat less attractive than a BS from what I've read online/on Reddit. How often does the ABET accreditation come up in industry?

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Computer Science student that is now learning about protocols. I have been trying to document myself and found out that protocols can be grouped in theoretical stacks to ease their understanding. As far as I am concerned there is an OSI Model and TCP/IP model, this second one is the most popular one.

&amp;#x200B;

I will like to know the roles and responsibilities of each layer. I have been reading some books and researching online, and this is what I came up with:

&amp;#x200B;

|Layer|Responsibility|Protocols Examples|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Application|To package core data that an application transmits to another end-system.|FTP, SMTP, POP3, HTTP|
|Transport|Establish bi-directional connection between two end-systems and ensuring the correct transmission of data between them.|TCP, UDP|
|Network|Ensure correct routing over networks.|IP|
|Data link|Ensure correct transmission of data to physical devices via MAC address.|Ethernet|
|Physical|Execute actual bits transmission via a media. If it is via a copper cable the transmission will be high and low voltage representing 1s and 0s.|Ethernet|

&amp;#x200B;

However, I feel that I am missing out other important responsibilities and information that each layer does. I will appreciate any information given that could help my understanding on this topic.

I'm studying CS at RWTH Aachen. So far I always have been told, that studying is a really awesome time. That there you can find the best friends, participate in many different communities, do tons of interesting stuff.
But the last few months of studying were for me quite bad. I learned almost all of the time, neglected all my friends, found not many interesting new people here, had no time for extracurriculars and don't feel like here are a lot of parties.
I somehow feel like I'm missing out on something. Additionally, from my old friends I hear that they on the other hand meet a lot of new people, have a lot of time, go to a lot of parties, protests... Most of them though are studying social sciences, although one also computer science (but at a different University)

Apart from that, I'm not sure anymore, if computer science is the right subject for me. I like the technical and practical and even some of the theoretical aspects, but I miss my social life. I worry how a future job could look. Will I work for hours in front of a desk? I believe I will miss workmates, variety and moving around.
Has someone maybe a good article that explains, how the jobs in CS usually look?

I'm thinking about taking a break, doing some internships and maybe changing University. What do you people here think about my situation? Would a full year break be a waste? Would changing university to one that is less focussed on technology be an option? Then I would miss out on interesting research, right?

Tl;Dr: my study life is boring. I only learn and am unsure, wether I really want to work in cs later. I can't really imagine, how it would be. (To few social contact, variety?) Im thinking about chsnging to a more general university in a bigger, more active city.",14,1

I have not had an internship/job in the field of computer science so I am not experienced on what the actual work entails. However, I am quite eager to finish up school and the extra workload will not be an issue for me.  

Do you guys believe that a summer internship is something necessary to the point where I should not pursue graduating early, or will I be okay with my bachelors with no work experience. I hope to find a job after I graduate in SoCal.

Instead, I am now considering taking a bootcamp or classes over the summer to better utilize my time if the internship route unfortunately seems unlikely...

I'm currently pursuing an AAS in Network Administrator. Why you ask? I wanted to pursue a career in IT because it's interesting to me, and I also wanted to do something practical that had a strong future with opportunities. 

My workplace has tuition assistance only for 2 year degrees, so that's why I'm in an AAS program. This assistance has a 12 month window, meaning the budget resets every 12 months. After winter I would have used the budget, so I would have to pay for Spring and Summer.

However, I suddenly have doubts if I'm pursuing the right degree. My school also offers an AAS and BA in Cyber Security. Perhaps I didn't do enough research, but Cyber Security sounded interesting but weird to me. It didn't sound like a traditional Computer Science program so I opted for Network Administrator because I liked the idea of setting up and managing networks. Cyber Security sounded too specific.

However, it sounds like Cyber Security has a better future in terms of jobs I already have a Bachelors degree in a liberal arts field which I feel hasn't helped me much so I'm trying not to mess up again.

Right now 10 of the 15 credits I'm doing apply towards the Cyber Security degree as well, so I would still be on the path towards that degree if I change it. A lot of the degree classes are the same but even missing a few would delay finishing so I don't want to do too many classes which only count for one degree. Right now if I switched I would only lose one class. If I paid for spring and summer, then my work could pay for Fall and winter next year and I would be done by winter.

Or should I focus more on certifications? Or both? I'm not sure what certifications I should get. It's a lot to choose. Many of the Computer Science programs at my school are similar and the classes are almost the same, so I'm not sure if it will matter too much whether or not I have Cyber Security, Network, Computer Information or something else.

What I mostly think sparked those is a video on youtube talking how a team might accidentally build an AI for a certain purpose that would get fed too much data and it would take over our world in an absurd way. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Now don't get me wrong I'm not specifically afraid of AI* but I started switching from Google to DuckDuckGo and from Microsoft to Linux based OS' probably mostly because of all the hate for data abuse.   
While I still think collecting data has many many great improvement purposes I feel like I'm missing something important that everyone is panicking about.   


**After listing a few pros and cons of giving out data I'd like to ask you a few questions:**

**- Pros:**

* Giving out data lets improve the services I'm using
* It allows for a free web
* Personalized ads are better than some random ones. (i.e. job ads)

\- **Cons:**

* The competing services are subpar
* Allows for abuse of my data

&amp;#x200B;

*I am aware that selling data and using it to improve own services are two different things. Also it's the government's job to regulate and protect the data with laws, however things are as they are and the main question is should I battle the internet for privacy*

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions are:**

* Are my concerns about data being abused valid
* Should I put in the effort to go off the grid and become anonymous or is the convenience I get worth th*e personal data\** I give out to Google or Microsoft (is this a win-win situation perhaps)
* Is it wrong feeding google or facebook so much ""Big Data""
* (bonus question) With increasing efforts from companies to merge all their products under one platform should we allow them the monopolies they are creating and what are upsides and downsides of those (convenience **vs** difficulty to switch to different products).

\**Note that personal data I'm refering to might range from my medical problems, personal pictures, real estate data, finances...* all of which can be used by an alogrithm to create my personal profile

Hello!

This is my first Reddit post. I've recently started studying about computer hardware and software. I have my training wheels on and i'm teaching myself everything I  can until starting some kind of formal education. Today 1/5/2019 I was just reminded what benchmarking is and I used Userbenchmark to further understand the performance of my computer. My mission here is to get feedback and or help to further optimize my computer with what I have right now. I know that my GPU is shit and will be saving for a new one. My SSD on the other hand is sufficient but not being utilized correctly (something about Sata3 cables I believe).  Any criticism and or help understanding what I have and how to improve would be awesome!

As many on here I am studying CS, first semester.

I am happy and enjoy the course so far, however there are some parts that make me think of switching to a different school and do a combination of 3days internship, 2 days school for three years. It is called a Dual Course here in Germany. At the end you have a lot of work experience and a bachelor of science.

However if I switch to the Dual Course I will specialise in Software Engineering and I am not sure yet if that is the direction I want to go. I also really like the technical engineering part so not sure if I should do it.

When did you know what you wanted to do with your CS degree and have you been able to switch later on?

Thanks in advance!

I am a student who lives in Italy and attends (after a year thrown into management engineering) chemical engineering, but I am not convinced of my choice.

Let's start with the two things that interest me the most

1. ***Chemistry***.  I'm very interested in chemistry, my mother teaches organic chemistry and I really like biology, microscopic work, genetics, natural sciences. But I do not know if / how I would like to work actively in this field.

2. ***Computer science***.  I've always been a fan of computer science, technology and everything around it. I would like to work on projects that are interesting for me but I don t like programming so much.. it does not excite me a lot.

I have chosen chemical engineering because I imagined it was the connection between this two things that I like the most, but in reality it is not so .. and after reading so much on careers, I can say that I dont like to design system or something like that.

What can I do ? What do you recommend? The only choices I have in mind are 1) change towards chemistry 2) change towards computer science 3) find a course that unites both (and not engineering)

Thank you very much to everyone, I am open to questions

I'm making cute, colorful, digestible posts to explain computer science-related topics in a language-agnostic way, because I've always been a visual learner and these would have helped me when I was learning. The goal is not to go too far in depth into any topic, but just to introduce it gently, give a few code examples and maybe real-life usage examples, and encourage people to think ""huh I've never heard of this before, neat"" and google for more information themselves, or perhaps give a name to a concept that you're familiar with, but were never formally introduced to.

So recently I have discovered that I have a passion for coding. I really enjoy coding and can definitely see myself enjoying work as a Software Engineer or Front-End developer. 

However I need to change majors to make this feasible.

I have two realistic options on the table for me. Either a BA in Computer Science or a BBA/BA in Business Information Systems.

I like the topics discussed in CS, like cyber security, big data, and AI, but I don't think I am setting myself up to succeed, with the heavy theory and math skills required. Basically major case of imposter syndrome. 

BIS to my knowledge is just a rebranding of the schools CIS degree, and I was thinking maybe it would be better for me and my goals but I'm not 100% sure.

My school is one of the more practical, less theorhetical CS degree schools, and by that I mean I take maybe 3 or 4 math classes total, and the rest are applied CS classes, but I still have a feeling of unease, like I don't belong.

I had my first CS class today, an elective I'm taking called Coding for Problem Solving. Just a basic introduction to not only Coding in Python but also how Coding works and what is happening inside the Computer when you code. It was very interesting, even if I already knew a lot of the basics from Codecademy.

In short, you guys have helped me out a lot in the past, and I just wanted to ask for this last bit of advice before I formally change my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a ""gaming laptop"" (yes, i know those words are kind of contradictory, hence the quotes), but it often requires really low settings to run games, usually the lowest graphics and 50% render scaling for 60fps, but if I put a game on the SSD, it works better (as you would expect). Unfortunately, I'm running out of SSD space, and given that it's a laptop, I can't really ""add"" space, per se. So I've been putting some games I recently downloaded on my hard drive, but they're pretty laggy.  I read somewhere on this site that you can have a computer that could run really fast, but the speed of your hard drive can ""bottleneck"" it, in the words of the comment.  The first question I have is ""Is this bullshit or true?"" and the second is ""if yes, I was able to find the [hard drive on my computer](https://www.disctech.com/Seagate-ST2000LM007-2TB-SATA-Hard-Drive), and it has a speed of  5400 rpm. is this fast compared to other hard drives?""

I am a sophomore studying CS at University of California, Santa Barbara, and because I did a lot of APs in high school, I have a unique opportunity to get a masters degree. Im mostly looking for advice here because Im pretty torn between the two. 

So here are my two choices:
1) get a BS and MS degree in four years total (maybe four years and a quarter) and then try to get a job. This would probably require summer school over this summer, so an internship might be out of the question. I would come out of college freshly 22 with a masters in CS. I already have a decently impressive resume for a 19 year old (not trying to brag, I still have lots to learn) and do independent freelance contract work, so money isnt really an issue for me right now. 

2) take school slow, get a BS in computer science in four years and maybe take a semester off and get an internship during the school year. Could also potentially just graduate early and start looking for a job early. Would be focusing on doing more freelance work to keep myself busy and programming. 

Basically the trade off is a years worth of school for a masters in CS, but I would be foregoing ~6 months of real world programming experience. Also for context I want to program not go into academia, so the masters would be to learn but also for the potential salary bump once I start working.

Im a 20 year old female and I have two years of Mechanical Engineering under my belt at a top ten university. However, I truly dislike the courses and have little interest. I enjoyed the calculus series, the physics classes, and thermodynamics. But the actual MechE classes like TAM (theoretical applied mathematics), fluid dynamics and ECE I dont have much interest or motivation to study..

My true passion is screenwriting and filming.. I write and shoot in my spare time. My parents would not pay for me to get a degree in screenwriting (which I genuinely understand). I got pushed into MechE by them.. But the problem is I have gotten through my MechE courses without actually learning much. I either last minute cram and help from friends. I do really love learning, but I dont think you can not force interest. Also cheating is huge in the STEM programs at my school because the competition just breeds that kind of environment. If you studied and go in and get a B, it will be curved down to a D because many students went in knowing the answers and get nearly perfect scores. Computer based testing over a four day period makes cheating very easy. For me playing the system is disheartening and unfulfilling.

I am thinking of switching to Computer Science. One reason I find computer science attractive is the ability to work remotely, from anywhere there is an internet connection. I know coding is difficult but I am excited to LEARN a skill that you cant bullshit and it seems more relevant than MechE. I also can see a future I would enjoy.. Most of the MechE jobs are maintaining assembly lines, designing random little parts, or analyzing existing machine processes and that would make me miserable. If Im looking for just a degree MechE is the quickest way out of school.. but I will not learn much and end up with a degree piece of paper, but not much skill. I would rather have a skill set, I think it's stupid just ""playing the game"".

I guess my question is do I just get a job, pursue screenwriting/filming full time (my parents wont support me at all).. Do I bullshit and finish my MechE degree (use it to get a business job later because I dont see myself doing MechE jobs) and film on my freetime? Do I switch to computer science and learn some skills instead of MechE?! Please let me know your thoughts... thanks guys I appreciate it!!",0,1

So...  

I get that a computers stores numbers, letters, even things as complex as a picture in 1s and 0s and I understand the basics of binary.

For the sake of the question, let's just say an f is represented by the number 14 so 1110 in binary. How does it go from the keyboard to actually being represented in that way? For the sake of simplicity, let's say there are just 4 bits. Like when I press f does that somehow trigger something in the computer's memory which then DOES NOT turn on certain transistors therefore NOT allowing current to flow to the fourth output cell (because 0 is the fourth digit) while turning on other transistors which allows current to flow to the first three output cells? Overall I am wondering how the information is encoded from the keyboard to its eventual storage.

""This unit provides an introduction to the concepts of database design from the conceptual level through to the physical level within database management systems. Students will study relational databases and learn how to model, create and efficiently query them using Structured Query Language (SQL). Further to this, relational algebra will be introduced to provide a more generalised definition of data and queries within relational database systems. The concepts of functional dependency, normalisation and relational decomposition will be introduced to promote sound database design to avoid redundancy. The unit will introduce approaches for connecting external applications to databases and provide awareness of security issues involved with data access. Further database topics including, query processing, transaction management and database security will be covered to provide students with a solid understanding of the techniques that underpin modern database management systems. Students will also gain experience in the design of object oriented and spatial databases"".

Can anyone suggest any video lectures, or a good learning platform to understand the basics before the unit starts (happy with more detailed stuff too)?

I have finally fulfilled all of the requirements and will be accepted next year.

However, I have been contemplating switching to BA in computer science. I enjoy it, I'm good at it, I'd get paid better/easier to find jobs, and it's way less school.

I have to decide before Feb 1. My passion is microbiology but I don't know if I can handle the course load and I will probably end up with a really low-paying job. I have taken 6 classes for the micro degree and none of these classes are related to comp sci at all. It would be 6 classes wasted if I switched.

I'm a student in computer science I could say... I have a problem and is that I really love programming but I'm really bad, I'm not new to this world, I have some knowledge about programming learning in class C, C++, and Java but I've struggled a lot because I can understand the syntax but the problem solving for me is horrible. I feel very insecure because I don't know sometimes how to approach the little programs they tell me to do. I'm in my second year and I struggle a lot with OOP and Algorithms and Complexity because of my poor base.

I really don't know how to learn properly the problem solving, I see other people doing it very easy compared to me, and being in the same class. I know that every person is different but I really want to build a strong base and be confident about my knowledge. I literally feel like a torrent, if you know what I mean, you download parts from everywhere and it's not gradual, I feel like a torrent in its 36% or something.

So I have a technical interview on Wednesday with a company that does software development with applications specifically in industries that use graph theory. The job listing lists relevant topics such as Dijkstra's algorithm, shortest path routing, algorithm heuristics, object-oriented programming, and Java. So of course this gave me a lot to research and I'm pretty comfortable with all of those things with the research and coding I've done so far.

But the email I got went specifically into how the technical interview will be structured, and I'm hoping that someone can help point me in the direction of what to study to make sure I'm ready. I'll say that my education is not in software engineering but I have done a lot of software development in high school, as a hobby, and whenever my nuclear engineering studies needed it. I say this because I want to ensure that people don't overestimate my knowledge and not suggest I study something because it might be ""software engineering 101"" or obvious to most people or anything like that.

So they say there will be three parts and the interview should be 3 hours in total. The first part they describe as I will be given a Java codebase to study, and I will have to make changes to it as per their instruction. I assume this will be a graph theory portion and in all likelihood I will be using a set of given classes to develop Dijkstra's algorithm. I think I have this part down and I know how to prepare for it.

The second part they describe as an algorithmic test that I can complete with pen and paper or anything I see fit. This is what confuses me the most. When I try to find something like this on Google, I get either generic interview questions that could be something like ""develop a program to determine if a string is a palindrome"" or ""develop a program to determine if a note can be written using words found in a larger string"", things like that. If this is something I can write with pen and paper, could they task me with solving these problems using pseudocode? Could this be something like determining the time complexity of an algorithm? Perhaps finding optimizations in a given algorithm? Please let me know if there's something else any of you think this might be describing because that would be a big help.

The third part also worries me, and is described as a Q&amp;A list with Java-related questions we will be running through together. Most of my concern is how complicated these questions may be. The extent of my knowledge in Java is mostly generic object-oriented programming knowledge because most of my experience is with Python. Of course I know Java syntax for normal operations and things defining functions (and things like static, public and private, etc.), classes, and I know most important data structures but I'm worried that they'll ask me higher level things. Do you guys have any ideas of questions they may ask? Of course I am also googling Java interview questions I just wanted second opinions from people on this sub just to cover my bases as much as possible.

However, this year Ive been struggling in AP Calc and my current grade is not even in the A/A- range (not very close either).

Additional Info about me:
Ive taken a few summer camps for computer science in the past few years that University of Washington offers. Ive done Python I, Java I, and Java II (the numbers dont really mean anything). I am unfortunately unable to take AP Computer Science in my school because we dont have any comp sci teacher to teach at my school anymore. I am planning to apply for a high school internship for Microsoft this upcoming summer, so hopefully I can get in. I am also planning to take a few college courses in my senior year for computer science so I can get a few credits for that. I am currently just self-teaching myself more Java and refreshing my memory from the past summer (I dont have any projects tho). My AP classes I have/currently taking right now: AP World History (finished), AP Calculus AB (current), AP Language &amp; Composition (current), and AP Chemistry (current).

&amp;#x200B;

Then for a fixed |V|, what is the largest possible ratio between this runtime and the runtime of Dijkstra using a Fibonacci heap?  Where knowing the Fibonacci heap: delete\_min = O(log |V |), insert/decrease\_key = O(1) (amortized) and |V |  delete\_min + (|V | + |E|)  insert = O(|V|log|V|+|E|). 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, d-ary heap implementation : delete\_min = O($\\dfrac{d \\log|V|}{log d}$) , insert/ decrease\_key =O($\\dfrac{log|V|}{log d}$) , and |V |  delete\_min + (|V | + |E|)  insert  =  O( (|V|d+|E|)$\\dfrac{ \\log|V|}{log d}$ ). 

&amp;#x200B;

As trying to follow a provide solution, but I am not sure why it reduces to O($\\dfrac{log|V|}{log |E|/|V|})$, in the case 1 where |E| dominates, so Dijkstra with Fibonacci heap is O(|E|), How can we get the ration as O($\\dfrac{log|V|}{log |E|/|V|})$ while Dijkstra with d-ary heap is O $( (|V|d+|E|)\\dfrac{ \\log|V|}{log d}$)?

I'm wondering about interviews/knowing a little about a lot. If I decide to get a different job I really won't know what to interview with (coding-wise) because I have such spread out experience and I'm not nearly an expert in any of it.

In your experience what is more beneficial, Jack of all trades or knowing a lot about one thing. I know teams kind of need both but in an interview setting if there is a broad range of skills what is more picked apart, if you will.

Any other information or tips at more of a senior level would be great. Common mistakes, things to watch for, progression, previous titles/jobs that weren't all they were cracked up to be.

Do NOT go for a science or CS degree. If you want to have any social life, a bearable workload, basically a chance of happiness, and if there's still an opportunity to choose/change your major, then, without hesitation make the wise choice: go into economics/management/business. (Not sure if this is one acceptable science exception: biology). Go into CS only if you're confident that you will not bear a moderately extroverted lifestyle (if you feel that introverted lifestyle is DEFINITELY what you choose). There is good pay for CS degrees and yes, you always hear how the field of CS has good opportunities for future job prospects. However, if you're not inherently/traditionally an introvert, drop it. It might save your life with how much mental suffering and toiling you will avoid as a result.  


Personally, I just transferred from CS to econ, and I was shocked just how different a humanities/social sciences experience is compared to sciences. It has an actual gender balance as compared to CS/Math/etc; mostly everyone is amiable and sociable; everyone is like YOU, an extrovert. I understood this during the first month of the fourth CS semester I took, where I saw how boring and hard CS will be for me, as I'm a more of a guy who would go hang out with friends than solve math problems on weekends. You will go to parties, social clubs and events, and just generally have a pleasurable lifetyle, if you transfer to Econ.  


I really want to help you, as I drudged without rest for 7 years in secondary school and 3 semesters in college doing math and programming, without ever trying out a more humanities-related course. If you chose CS and still have the option to avoid going this route, then please proceed and remove computer science from the list of your registered courses, and change the major/school that you belong to.",1,1

I'm an 18yo from Italy which has to choose my college course. 


In Italy we have what we call ""Informatics"" and ""Informatics engineering"": the first is mostly about programming, meaning exams consist about 50% Maths and 50% ""Informatics"" (so data management, programming...; vast majority software related), while the latter consist in studying more ""scientific subjects"" such as Physics and Chemistry in addition to the previous two. This means that it's less focused on software, and from what I've known, you come out of it as a much less experienced programmer (I think you only work with JavaScript in most universities of said course), but you have a more general view of the whole world of ICT, both hardware and software (meaning there's more electronics, for example, and also gives you access to specialized courses in Industrial and Robotic Informatics).


So my question is: Considering I probably want to move out from my country to find work, in order to compete to CS students, which one should I pick?

I talked with my teacher about it, and since they know me, I was able to switch it last-minute to an essay about Kali Linux, which I started learning about a week ago.

The problem is, between school and preparing for college, I really only know like half of the terminal commands and I can't talk about hacking (my high school is very conservative when it comes to computer science, ""hack"" is like saying the f-word) so I need some topics of essay-writing about Kali Linux.

Anything goes. How to create notes, how to download extra things onto Kali, anything that doesn't involve ""hacking behavior"" (not my words).

I'm pursing a Bachelor of Science (B.S), Applied Computing Systems and Technology w/ a concentration in either Business Analysis or Cybersecurity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I already know this isn't a true, ""Computer Science"" degree, its basically Information Technology. With that being said, I have a few questions...

&amp;#x200B;

Any CS individuals, have you ever come across an IT person working in the same area as you at work?

What can you do in the CS field with an IT degree, since IT isn't full blown CS?

&amp;#x200B;

Another question is, the major im doing is from a highly noticeable research university. Top 50 overall in the US. There are two ways to get this degree. You can either enroll in the main university (28-32 ACT score) plus $60k tuition a year or you can enroll in the ""part-time division"" of the school. SAME DEGREE, SAME MAJOR CLASSES, just social science, humanities, math requirements. The Partime division is what I can afford (no way the same cost as the regular university) but will employers shy away bc my degree would say B.S. Applied computing from X University from X school because it wouldn't have B.S. Applied University from Main entrance to university school...

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what minor would be best with this degree? Business Studies? Management? Accounting? Finance?

\- Hardware and the way in which the internals of computers work as they do

\- Software development for commercial use and Cyber Security

\- Basic Graphic Design

Looks good and explains all the hardware-related concepts a potential systems engineer should understand. Hence I'm going to read it, I haven't read it earlier because I wasn't ready for the technicalities yet (the book assumes that the reader understands the basics).

The problem is that it was released in 2002, so it doesn't take into account many things that evolved since then, mainly AMD64 architecture.

Do you think that I should read the book (because for the most part it's still valid, as the x86 architecture hasn't changed that much, and even if, then understanding the old stuff is highly beneficial), or should I find a new release (because many things have changed since then and me reading this book is like studying literal 8086 precessor)?

I know that my question is very vague. In other words, we can ignore the book and think ""since 2002, has the knowledge about the x86 architecture only expanded, or has it been partially replaced?"". For example, one can read maths book from year 1900 and it's still perfectly valid, just misses new advancements, but reading a book about C++ from 2009 would give one erroneous information.",2,1

&amp;#x200B;

Hi. I'm a CS student, and I've gone through a lot of strong principles of CS. Architecture, programming languages, intensive programming, algorithms, and data structures. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this guy wanted to offer me experience, he already had OTHER people building his app for him likely paying them the same thing. If you're a college CS student or a graduate who hasn't explored your business side, this will be of great use to you.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about me, but not all about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm making games. (Not good ones) I will be employable by next semester, my skills are a high-ticket item. 

So naturally, after spending some time in my school's business school I have become wary of Edisons trying to turn me into their Testlas. This individual was such an Edison. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, when this guy brought up programming I put on my negotiation face: coldness and aloofness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I randomly looked away from him and back to my  computer. He told me that he was building a platform for businesses to effectively transfer data. I asked him: isn't that why people use telephones or Verizon? He claims its an alternative, but considering how servers and data packets work and the fact that he had suckers on his team and they already had a working version, I already realized that they must have bought his crap. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told him that I put a lot of time and energy into this and my skills are marketable, I asked him what he was going to pay me with. 

&amp;#x200B;

He replied immediately: Experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him more and more aloofness and distance, I told him how this reminds me of the Edison and Testla situation. Edison was making the money and Testla labored tirelessly, I asked him why should I even work for you? What do you even bring to the table?

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately he deflected the question and asked me what I can bring: I pulled up a game I programmed on Unity, a Windows 10 app for tracking time spent on reddit and other time-wasting sites, I also tried showing him a table trying to copy the amazon model of customer data but he didn't understand it (which means its bad by my standards). 

&amp;#x200B;

he then went on to use business-student Jargon. I take the customers needs and convey their requirements to the programmers, that is the 'value' I bring to the table. (If you have spent even 5 minutes in a marketing class, you will hear the word value tossed around a lot.) 

&amp;#x200B;

We exchanged info, but I was so offended by this asshole that it made me kind of mad.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not an actor, a dancer, or a goddamn model. I'm a computer scientist with a 3.0 G.P.A, Hell, I am willing to gamble some grads can't compete with me. This guy wants to pay me in EXPERIENCE? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I posting this? I don't know how many people who read this whom have exposure to business-lingo or businessmen, but let me be real with you: CS is the hardest major on any college campus. You could take courses online, read textbooks and effectively make this businessman moot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do not fall for charismatic or superficial charm. Truth is, your skills as a computer scientist or programmer is a high ticket item that they NEED. They can't replace you with kids in India either, they tried. It doesn't work. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're the Edisons of our generations and we are equipped with the knowledge of Testla, we're NOT going to suffer like Testla. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the second businessman who tried pulling crap like this, it's sickening.

The theory is that we've gotten so removed from how the hardware works that sometimes it's hard for us to conceptually understand--as programmers and computer engineers and scientists--just how we go from a simple transistor to a working computer.

And originally I wasn't planning to build the whole thing.

Uh, well, I think I'm going to build the whole thing.

So far, rather than just talk about the hardware and the concepts I've started building the circuits I've been describing. And thus far, from my fourth video (where I show how an ALU can tie in with a data bus to an accumulator and four 8-bit registers), I've actually built the arithmetic logic unit, and now I've built the accumulator.

I've posted a video showing it in action [on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIano1fO9qM)

Of course this thing is taking a while to build. It's taking me about an hour to solder one register bit out of transistors (and m soldering technique has definitely improved), and I have 20 more boards to build before I can show off the B through E registers. And of course I'm waiting for Seeed Studios to deliver the flags logic board so I can show a working flags register.

I think I've gone insane.

But I hope this helps someone better understand how computers work. It's definitely becoming an obsession of mine.",0,1

My school had a policy where I could reapply after a semester off, but I never ended up going back. Just worked for about 4 yrs in the legal/patent field, but my career outlook wasn't that good w/out a degree.

I have now decided to go back to the school (same one, 4yr respected University in US) and graduate asap, probably take a year and half/2yrs. I can confidently say that the second time around things will be different. 
Initially, my plan was just to graduate asap (possibly with a polysci degree), and possibly try for grad school. But I have taken some online python courses and was looking into pursuing a undergrad comp sci degree. 
Do you think pursing computer science just for the job prospects is a good idea?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been stuck on this problem for a while and it's been bugging me to the ends of the Earth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what's happening is that I have a couple buses running along a circuit. Along this circuit is a couple of bus stops. My goal is figure out the correct distance between a bus and a bus stop, so that I can calculate an approximate ETA. (I've managed to figure out how to get the speed of the buses). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an algorithm that can calculate distances between two pairs of lat/long points, but the problem is that its a straight line distance and not an accurate representation of the actual distance a bus travels.

&amp;#x200B;

I *could*  call the Google Maps API to calculate the distance *for every* bus stop *for every* bus but that seems wildly inefficient and would cost me tons. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I could possible model this using a directed graph where the nodes are the bus stops and the weights would be the distances between them. Then my problem is how do I model a bus that's currently traveling on a vertex? 

&amp;#x200B;

If I could implement graph maybe I could figure out a algorithm that can calculate distance for me. Where the input to such a function is a bus stop and the output is a bus.

&amp;#x200B;

But for right now I've hit a wall and don't know where to go. Any advice reddit? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

I previously majored in management information systems (1st year and 1st semester of sophomore year) but decided to switch because I wasn't interested in many business classes. Honestly, I'm not very passionate about computers and technology but I decided to major in Computer and Information science because I have a genuine interest in technology and how they work, and what technology is best for certain situations. But now I'm taking programming fundamentals 2 and I'm kind of lost right now and I'm feeling discouraged because I feel like I try to push myself to do better and learn in the class but I still feel like I'm going no where. Plus, I have to get a ""B"", to move on to programming fundamentals 3 and thinking about that makes me more nervous. I honestly don't like programming because I feel it's too time consuming and boring. I know people may see that sentence I wrote and say, ""If you hate programming, why did you major in this?"", and to answer that question, it is because I've seen courses that you take later on in the major and they seem interesting, like ""networks"", ""network system administration"", ""multimedia processing"", ""database"" , etc. And on top of that, my major ""Computer and information science"" is more about  how a computer is actually used in the real world and it focuses on how data is gathered, processed, stored, transformed, and used, whereas a regular computer science major  is about the theory, design, and engineering of computers and focuses heavily on programming and coding and computer and information science just appealed more to me. And I've also done research and saw that they're tech careers that require little to no programming. I've honestly thought about switching majors but I wouldn't really know what to switch to anyway and plus it would push me back more as Im in the second semester of my 3rd year and I don't want to rack up more student loans. I just feel lost, there is one side of my head telling me to consider switching and the other side of my head is telling me to stick with it and be optimistic about the courses that seem interesting later down the major.",3,1

The year was, hm, maybe 2003. I had a computer with some sort of AMD processor (can't remember exact details). I was interested in making music. I had previously worked with FastTracker 2 during my teenage period but decided to give Impulse Tracker a go. So I downloaded version 2.14 or maybe it was 2.17, I don't remember.  
I launched it through the command prompt (it was made for DOS and I was using Windows 2000 at the time) and IT crashed at some point.  
After the crash, everything was sped up at ridiculously high speeds. Normally, the monitor would go into power saving mode after 10 or 15 minutes but it took like 5-10 seconds. The clock in the lower right corner ticked the minutes extremely fast. It was really weird.  
Everything was extremely fast. Menus, EVERYTHING. It felt like a super-duper-fast computer :P

  
So I decided to try Counter-Strike (1.6?) in this state just to see how it would handle all of this. I moved at normal speed or so it seemed anyway but when I shot my pistol (CT - USP) at the terrorists, I actually hit where I aimed (heads). I was on ADSL at the time so I had 50-90 ms ping at the time but when my computer was sped up like this, it felt like playing local against bots, 1 ms ping. I called in a mate of mine (lived in a student dorm) and he thought I was using aimbot because I got all these ridiculously crazy head shots with ease.

A reboot fixed everything but unfortunately, the hard drive took a good beating because of all of this as I started getting weird sounds and the drive had to be replaced at some point.

My Diablo 2 cinematic disc also exploded in my CD-ROM drive rendering the install completely useless :(

I looked at a myriad of options for my major and absolutely none of them captured my attention, except computer science. The thing is, Ive read a lot of comments and feedback from CS Majors talking about how boring and soul-wrenching (in the sense that it feels like an unending routine and being stuck doing the same thing over and over) work can be, and thats one of the things that I definitely dont want in my future life.

My grades arent the best but Im a quick and intuitive learner if Im really interested in what Im looking at.

What should I have in mind at the moment? What should I do to explore if this is the major for me? What courses should I take during the summer before going to college?

I have some IT experience but very little to be honest. I didn't have the opportunity to work in this field but I really want to. It's just difficult because I never was able to get an entry level position. I tried and tried but never got accepted anywhere even after having many many interviews. 

Lately, someone recommended me for this position inside of a company because  they deemed that I was suitable for it. They told me to be ready for a test. As far as I know the test might last for 2 hours and that makes me even more anxious than I already am because I'm in a pinch right now and I really really really need a job and I believe I can manage it if I work hard and learn while I will be there but the test part is frightening.

So, dear people, help me! Please explain to me what is that a NOC operator does and what should I study in order to pass the test? I need documentation and advice! Please! 

Thank you!

At the moment, it's been a hobby but could potentially it turning into a career. That being said, I'm considering a range of programs. 

Yes, a second undergrad degree will take more time and be more difficult but I know the pay-off would be much heavier. However, I'm also looking into months-long bootcamps (Java vs web dev material) with shorter term/potentially more interesting topics covered.

The hardest part was probably coming up with an idea to do. After that, we did a web dev project.. I was definitely the weakest link here. I haven't finished my degree yet, but I've done competitive programming in the past and was hoping to come here and let my C++ skills shine.. I hacked my way through react.JS in the past 24 hours and wish I hadn't agreed to this project, ha. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those who are in the shoes I was 48 hours ago, try to find a way to incorporate your passion and skill set with your group (Unity, game-design, java, etc). If I would've shown a little more confidence in my ability in java, we probably could've built our app in java with a GUI and that honestly would've taken just as long as learning web dev and trying to incorporate APIs. However, we experimented with and learned something new and networked with professionals already doing this - which is the point of a hackathon. Come in with an open mind, go to the classes offered, and laugh a lot and you will love hackathons! I'm definitely hyped on caffeine and sleep deprived, but I had a successful first hackathon! I will definitely try to hit up another MLH hackathon before I graduate! 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of the weekend, the hottest in demand skills were python, web dev, unity, and hardware. Not to say if you don't have these skills you are useless or won't have a good time, but if you have time before your hackathon, definitely try to learn one of these skill sets. Devposts are due in an hour and our MVP doesn't work, but we're still going to demo! That's the fun of hackathons, we get to show other computer science students what we tried, how far we got, and how we went about what we did accomplish! We created an app that allows students at universities to capture a photo of maintenance needs (pot hole, tree down, etc), put a description of the event, and allow other students to up vote / down vote the event (crowd sourcing priority). We wrote a script that goes through the image and pulls lat/long geo-data so we can monitor where events are on the map. Overall, it was a fun project! ",0,1

Lately Ive been somewhat interested in Software Dev despite currently not knowing much about coding, but after looking a bit online Ive noticed a bunch of people commenting on CS with things such as: not being able to get a job a year after graduating, The field being over saturated, ageism, Being self-taught or going to some boot camp as being better compared to getting a CS degree, and even something about another tech job crash/cave or something (saw someone on reddit comment this somewhere).

All those above sort of make me feel unsure about the value of a CS degree and if its worth pursuing.
Like I said I feel like I would like to go to college to learn but I keep seeing these comments on CS that make me worry if this is a good Career path.


Another thing, Im not sure if follow your passion would apply to me since I havent felt completely passionate about any specific field, I just want to try and study hard for a career that can give me a stable job/ future, and CS has interested me as one potential career path that I can aim for.

I am thinking of my future major and minor since I plan to apply for some summer programs. I want to take psychology or anthropology as my minor, but I have no idea about majors or BS/MS programs. As I do research on several colleges websites I found that there are so many areas related to computer science or computational engineering, but I dont understand what exactly are they and I dont know what specific future careers I can seek. I tried to find out by doing more research but I am still kind of confused. So I need help from you experienced experts! Could somebody please answer these questions below for me? 

1. What are some general differences between comp si and computational engineering? What careers can I seek if I major in CS/CE?

2. Generally speaking, what are some main study areas of comp si and computational engineering now? How are they related to other science and social study areas? What are specific careers I can seek in the future and what exactly do people do in those occupations?

3. What are some good summer programs for me( sophomore) that can help me explore in those areas?( I am currently applying for CMU summer school and Cornell summer camp.)

I am a high school senior in the Greater Cincinnati area. There is an organization called InterAlliance, which does a multitude of great things (job shadowings at Fortune 500 companies, hosts Tech Olympics the largest high school IT conference, and many other opportunities). One of the big things they do is work with large companies like Kroger Technology, P&amp;G, 5/3 Bank, and more to provide summer internships for high school juniors and seniors. I must submit a resume, however, being a high school student I obviously dont have any real IT experience. 

What should I include on my resume? Would it be appropriate to put where I got accepted to college for computer science? I have experience with C# and Java, and even 3D modelling with applications such as Blender and Cinema 4D, so I figure that would belong there. 

I am also highly involved in band programs and have done many honor type activities, like All-State and district band, so would that belong on my resume?

Im just a little lost and would like any input or help you guys could offer. Thank you for any suggestions!

I'm roughly 3 years away from completing that. I'm 33 years old, father of two, expecting our third in a month. Married, homeowner, I'm trying to paint the picture that I am very busy but also very motivated to complete this degree and move on. 

I started my career in IT 6 years ago, I have no formal training, no certs. I started out doing shipping and receiving in a deployment center, from there moved to the deployment team, building and loading PCs. Did a stint on a help desk and for the last 4 years I've been doing on-site support/field tech type work for a major retailer. The job paid very well but I ignored red flags and am now trying to plan my transition out of the job and into a more interesting position. About the most interesting thing I've done here is to build a batch file using some grep commands to give us a complete list of network devices we have for a project I'm leading. 

At home I am building a homelab to mess around on, I was able to procure some homelab equipment from my job. The plan is to finish my CS Degree and do some stuff at home to keep my mind agile and focused. I don't think I can gut it out at my current position though. 

What I'm looking for are maybe some suggestions for jobs that a CS student could pursue while actively taking classes that might be more beneficial. It is a possibility to stay at this current position and take advantage of the tuition reimbursement but I really want to move on due to the environment. All of my coworkers are less than 3 years from retirement, that includes our director and everyone I report to.

An example to highlight my question: Java is compiled into an intermediate language, that is then JIT'd by the JVM which runs this intermediate language. But this JVM has to use your cpu to run calculations eventually right? Like the JVM has to eventually translate the IL to something the CPU can understand, which eventually gets translated to binary.  


With a simple compiled language, a compiler has to be built for every unique machine it is run on, is this also true for VM's? Am I understanding this workflow correctly?",4,1

It's at a point where I'm having to take the semester off while I seek a proper diagnosis/treatment plan along with working with my school's assisted learning centre to see what they can provide to help me work around this temporary (I hope) disability.

Can anyone recommend any assistive technology that is designed specifically for programming/math? I've been searching online and seems like some people have built some pretty cool custom setups like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI) which is super cool but different from an ""industry standard"" program like what Dragon is for regular dictation.

I figured I'd put the question out there and see if anyone can offer some suggestions of anything I could use to help me continue to practice my programming skills without the use of my hands, probably something voice based but I'm open to other ideas. My degree is mainly Java/python based if that's a factor. Thanks!",3,1

Do you have any recommendations for computer science podcasts that explain more fundamental/theory aspects of several areas of CS? Eg Turing Completeness, formality of state machines, etc. 

Im a software developer and do a fair amount of reading on programming and software dev in general, but I know much less about and more interested in some of the foundational concepts in computer science (idk if that makes sense) being explained 

I really enjoyed this video if that gives some context: https://youtu.be/RPQD7-AOjMI

Thank you in advance!!

My reasons for potentially transferring are the following: I know the degrees are similar in most aspects, however, at TRU the CS program seems too easy in comparison with the SE program. Let me elaborate, the CS program has no first or second-year calculus courses while the SE program has several -not to mention general engineering courses. The programs both offer great co-ops, but SE requires a full year. Because I live in Kamloops and can graduate with very little debt I went to TRU. Should I switch programs based on these reasons? Is it better to do SE when you're at a smaller university?  ",6,1
