I'm a high school student with great aspirations. For 3-4 years I decided that getting into a good university and getting a good job after that should be my main purposes for the next few years. So I started learning C, learning my maths, got to the national phase at both Mathetmatics olympiad and Informatics olympiad ( Huge competition in my country, out of thousands of students, 40-50 go to the national phase ), participated in lot of contests and my latest achievement would be getting whatever-it's-called prize on google code-in, basically the highest achievement except for the trip to Google HQ ( Done my tasks in 2 days, total time was 2 months ).

Reading online about what jobs require I've started learning :

 Photoshop (Made about 600$ in commissions, freelancer things for sites like 99designs, graphics for friends)

C++

HTML

Javascript (I'm a noob, just started)

CSS

Maya(I'm a noob, just started)

PHP

We have a grading system here in Romania, with grades ranging from 1 to 10, and my average is something between 9.80 and 9.95, don't know exactly. I'll take the CAE exam this year, been studying for it for the past 3 years, and next year I'll take my IELTS. 

After this weird introduction here are my questions :

What did you do/What were your qualifications for getting into a university that was not in your country? *I would really like to leave this hellhole and go to a place like England/US*

What should I do/What qualifications should I get before finishing highschool so I can increase my chances of being admitted?

What position/job do you have now? Are you happy with it? What do you do on a daily basis? How much money do you get per month and in what country are you working?

How hard were the classes? I asked one a friend that is in his 2nd year and they were taught the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which I've already learnt last year.

Would you recommend CS studies, do you think they have potential? Or should I go for a subject that might be more safe ( for example Law or Economics )

INTRODUCTION

1.1	SYNOPSIS

In India, most of the low budget cars are not equipped with prominent technologies. Our motivation is to implement one such technology named AUTOMATIC WEATHER CONTROL IN CAR A/C at a very low budget such that it could be afforded by all class of people.

	
This technology is available only in class A and class B cars. Not all people could afford such cars but the hatchback type of cars which are more in India. In none of the hatchbacks, this technology is available. So our project as a product would be a great demand in the automotive market especially for the hatchbacks.
	

	We have developed a prototype which can be customized according to the A/C setup of the manufacturer.  Hatchbacks are produced by Hyundai, Maruti, Tata, Opel etc., We have studied the A/C setup and working of the Getz model Hyundai car for our project. 

2	INTRODUCTION TO EMBEDDED SYSTEM

2.1	EMBEDED SYSTEM TOOLS
                 Before knowing about the embedded system we shall know about the microprocessors and microcontrollers.

2.1.1	MICROPROCESSOR
            Microprocessor is a chip that contains a CPU. In the world of personal computers CPU and microprocessors are used interchangeably. At BCA final year Projects heart of all personal computers and workstations sits a microprocessor. Microprocessors also control the logic of almost all digital devices, from clock radios to fuel-injection systems for automobiles.
 Three basic characteristics differentiate microprocessors;
	Instruction set: The set of instructions that BCA final year Projects microprocessor can execute.
	Bandwidth: The number of bits processed in a single instruction 
	Clock speed: Given in megahertz (MHz), the clock speed determines how many instructions per second the processor can execute.

         In both cases higher BCA final year Projects value, the more powerful the CPU. For example, a 32-bit microprocessor that runs at 50 MHz is more powerful than 16-bit microprocessor that runs at 25 MHz. In addition to bandwidth and clock speed, microprocessors are classified as being either RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) or CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer). 


2.1.2	MICROCONTROLLER
                     A computer-on-a-chip is a variation of microprocessor which combines the processor core (CPU), some memory, and I/O (input/output) lines, all on one chip. The computer-on-a-chip is called BCA final year Projects microcomputer whose proper meaning is a computer using a (number of) microprocessor (s) as its CPUs, while the concept of the microcomputer is known to be a microcontroller.

2.1.3	ADVANTAGES OF USING MICROCONTROLLER OVER MICROPROCESSOR:
A designer will use a microcontroller to
	Gather input from various sensors
	Process this input into a set of actions 
	Use the output mechanism on BCA final year Projects microcontroller to do something useful
	RAM and ROM are inbuilt in the MC
	Cheap compared to MP
	Multi machine control is possible simultaneously
Examples: 
    8051 (ATMAL), PIC (Microchip), Motorola (Motorola), ARM Processor, Applications: 
      Cell phones, Computers, Robots, Interfacing to two pcs. 

Microcontroller Core Features:
 High-performance RISC CPU.
 Only 35 single word instructions to learn.
 All single cycle instructions except for program branches which are two cycle.
 Operating speed: DC - 20 MHz clock input DC - 200 ns instruction cycle.
 Up to 8K x 14 words of FLASH Program Memory, Up to 368 x 8 bytes of Data      Memory (RAM) Up to 256 x 8 bytes of EEPROM data memory.
 Pin out compatible to the PIC16C73B/74B/76/77
 Interrupt capability (up to 14 sources)
 Eight level deep hardware stack
 Direct, indirect and relative addressing modes.
 Power-on Reset (POR).
 Power-up Timer (PWRT) and Oscillator Start-up Timer (OST).
 Watchdog Timer (WDT) with its own on-chip RC oscillator for reliable operation.
 Programmable code-protection.
 Power saving SLEEP mode.
 Selectable oscillator options.
 Low-power, high-speed CMOS FLASH/EEPROM technology.
 Fully static design.
 In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) .
 Single 5V In-Circuit Serial Programming capability.
 In-Circuit Debugging via two pins.
 Processor read/write access to program memory.
 Wide operating voltage range: 2.0V to 5.5V.
 High Sink/Source Current: 25 mA.
 Commercial and Industrial temperature ranges.
 Low-power consumption.
In this project we used PIC 16f877A microcontroller. PIC means Peripheral Interface Controller. The PIC family is having different series. BCA final year Projects series are 12- Series, 14- Series, 16- Series, 18- Series, and 24- Series.  We used 16 Series PIC microcontrollers.

2.2	DESIGN OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS:
                A system is something that maintains its existence and functions as a whole through the interaction of its parts. 

Example:
Body, Mankind, Access Control, etc. 

A system is a part of the world that a person or group of  persons during some time interval and for some purpose choose to regard as a whole consisting of interrelated components, each component characterized by properties that are selected as being relevant to the purpose.
	Embedded system is a combination of hardware and software used to achieve a single specific task.
	Embedded systems are computer systems that monitor, respond to, or control and external environment. 
	Environment connected to systems through sensors, actuators and other I/O interfaces.
	Embedded system must meet timing and other constraints imposed on it by environment.

* help point each other in the right direction with the problems we are solving (especially by trying to figure out what are the relevant bits of knowledge we need in order to tackle the problem)
* work together on writing little tutorials that help teach knowledge relevant to solving the problems we encounter
* work on major group programming projects together (we can decide as a subreddit what we'd all like to do as a project, and then work on that for a couple of months, etc.)
* work together on online courses we might decide to study
* provide resources to others that may not have access to them in order to learn (books, papers, etc.)
* [pick apart Edsger Dijkstra's EWDs to see what we can learn from them, or comment on what we disagree about](http://www.reddit.com/r/computingscience/comments/1tz806/subreddit_project_list_of_ewds_upon_which_you_may/)
