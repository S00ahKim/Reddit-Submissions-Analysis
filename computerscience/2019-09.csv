* Can someone explain things to me so I could understand things better?
* Link me to youtube tutorials about these?
* Online resources and books for digital design/electronics stuff

* We have to use and/or/not gates first before moving on to the next gates.
* I know how to do truth table, but when checking they say stuff like 0 1, 1 0, 0 0, stuff goes on

My question is, should this be done from scratch (i.e HTML, CSS etc...) as you are trying to show your skillset and capabilities, or would using a bootstrap template/wordpress site be just as good (if not better), or would this be seen as ""cheating""?

\- 24 y old dude with no big commitments like a GF, kids, etc.

\- Early in career, I graduated with a CS degree last December.

\- I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer at a great company building SAAS software

\- I""m NOT in Silicon Valley, but good ol Idaho (yee-ha! just kidding)

\- at work I use Reactjs, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Web API, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core (we are in this awkward relationship with .NET Core, kind of like two teenagers who think they may have crushes on eachother, but aren't good at communication), SQL Server, some NoSQL tech is emerging, TeamCity &amp; Octopus for CI/CD, ELK for logging, AWS as our cloud provider, and a myriad of other technologies sprinkled here and there (for example RabbitMQ)

\- Since I am only 8 months out of school at my new job, but had over a years experience before I came here, and was an undergraduate researcher (with that being said, I still feel like a deer in the headlights)

\- I really enjoy the whole stack, and I am essentially the lead front end developer and a new product we are releasing to early adopters, etc., but my day to day seriously has me doing everything from CSS tweaks, to optimizing views and stored procedures, to running through ELK logs, fixing TeamCity build configurations, wiring up new endpoints in our API, etc.",2,0

After a few hours, I opened my laptop...it actually push through tul it reaches the desktop. Then all of a sudden my mouse cursor just went loading(the blue circle thing). I kinda waited for like a couple of minutes. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes and it was still loading and I didn't know why.

Before that, I was way into retro video gaming and even did some impressive (not impressive for an adult, but for an under 10 year old kid) light modding on some old NESs and SNESs (simple stuff like changing out the power indicators to different colors, trace cut on NES to fix blinking light etc..) I have always thought it was the whole package of a computer I was interested in, but honestly it was just the hardware that I was most fascinated by. I built a computer at 13, as have a lot of people that age, but I was mainly fascinated by the building process and how it worked. When I was around 14 I got back into retro video games, but more specifically the picture quality aspect, e.g. RGB mods (although I haven't been able to afford anything yet), how FPGAs work, older CRT PVMs and their astonishing technology (at least to me,) etc. Also, I've quite recently got into cars, as it makes sense given my fascination with hardware. ECUs control everything in modern cars, and that part has obviously taken my attention quite a bit. Ideally, in a perfect dream world, I'd love to be either working for Nvidia/AMD designing next generation GPUs for either consumer use or for use in next generation consoles (or directly for those companies), or designing the computer systems for supercars, or even ECUs for modding communities for stuff like engine swaps.

All of this is to say, I don't know where to begin in trying to learn how to actually hardware engineer. I know how a computer works fairly well, but I couldn't point out the difference between a BIOS flash chip and a Southbridge (northbridge is easy, usually close to the CPU lol.) There's the obvious stuff like learning breadboards, which I had some minor experience with when I was younger, but after that, I'm at a loss of what to do. I could start doing some more heavy modding on my game consoles, or I've also considered fully learning FPGAs and trying to create either a hardware emulation of an NES or SNES, which is way easier said than done, and is a huge leap from just doing breadboards. Again, all of these ideas are good in practice, but I don't know what my path should be in terms of learning on my own to get some good experience before college. After fully fleshing out my skills with breadboards, what are some recommendations for things to do to expand my knowledge on the subject? I.e. what is a recommended path to get to a complex understanding of hardware engineering, rather than my very basic understanding, before college? I've fucked around all high school with my thumb up my ass, so I'm not getting into any hugely accredited colleges or anything like that, so I need to build my skill set to the best of my ability to achieve my goals, rather than relying on getting into the best school.",4,2

A separate register/cache?). It's embarrassing that 3 years into my degree and I don't know any of this or have even been exposed to it from my school. Once I finish coursework, I immediately look for extra curricular resources to actually learn these things.

	The leading bit is the sign: 02 means the number is positive; 12 indicates a negative number.

	The remaining digits are the magnitude of the number in unsigned binary.

Decimal to Signed Magnitude:

	Convert the decimal to unsigned binary;

	If the decimal is a negative number, add a leading bit of 12; otherwise, add a leading bit of 02.

	Add 02s between the sign bit and the magnitude bits until the word is the correct number of bits.

Signed Magnitude to Decimal:

	If the leading bit is 12 then the decimal is a negative number; otherwise, the decimal is a positive number;

	Convert the magnitude bits from unsigned binary to decimal.

**Ones Complement**

	The leading bit is the sign: 02 means the number is positive; 12 indicates a negative number.

	If the number is positive, the remaining bits are the magnitude of the number in unsigned binary.

	If the number is negative, the remaining bits are the complement of the magnitude of the number in unsigned binary.

Decimal to Ones Complement:

	Convert the decimal to unsigned binary;

	If the number is positive, add a leading sign bit of 02;

	If the number is negative, complement the number, then add a leading sign bit of 12;

	Add 02s between the sign bit and the magnitude bits until the word is the correct number of bits.

Ones Complement to Decimal:

	If the leading bit is 12 then the decimal is a negative number; otherwise, the decimal is a positive number;

	If the number is positive, convert the magnitude bits from unsigned binary to decimal;

	If the number is negative, complement the magnitude bits, then convert them from unsigned binary to decimal.



**Twos Complement**

	The leading bit is the sign: 02 means the number is positive; 12 indicates a negative number;

	If the number is positive, the remaining bits are the magnitude of the number in unsigned binary;

	If the number is negative, the remaining bits are one less than the complement of the magnitude of the number in unsigned binary.

Decimal to Twos Complement:

	Convert the decimal to unsigned binary;

	Add leading 02s before the magnitude bits to make the word one less than the correct number of bits.

	If the number is positive, add a leading sign bit of 02;

	If the number is negative, complement the number, add 12, then add a leading sign bit of 12;

Twos Complement to Decimal:

	If the leading bit is 12, the decimal is a negative number; otherwise, the decimal is a positive number;

	If the number is positive, convert the magnitude bits from unsigned binary to decimal;

	If the number is negative, complement the number, add 12, then convert the magnitude bits from unsigned binary to decimal.

**Excess-M (Offset Binary)**

	Excess-M is equivalent to unsigned binary biased by an integer M, where M is one less than a power of 210.

	02 is defined as M represented in unsigned binary. (e.g., 010 = 011111112  in excess-127)

	All 02s represents the smallest number and all 12s represents the largest number.

Decimal to Excess-M:

	Add M to the decimal, then convert to unsigned binary.

Excess-M to Decimal:

	Convert the decimal to unsigned binary, then subtract M.",0,0

Long time lurker and pretty much never post but I'm in desperate need of some guidance. I obtained a BS degree previously and was in an unfulfilling industry for years before I discovered programming and my love for it. I worked my butt off and now I'm a CS major at a university (just transferred from a community college where I did my basics). I guess I'm just getting into the meat of the program and I feel like I am so hopelessly lost. I took the foundations for programming, discrete math, etc. classes, most in java, and I did fine. The programming ones were online courses so I never had face to face interaction. Now I'm taking OOP design and implementation (java) and I feel like I've never even seen any of this stuff in my life. It is as if I am missing classes that everyone else has taken or something and I can't seem to pull myself out of this dark hole that i am in, feeling like I just can't do it. It's almost to the point that I want to drop out but my fiance and I have sacrificed so much to get me this far so I just cant.

Currently, I'm a senior software engineer and I'm looking to do masters in Computer Science but I'm certain my math skills are lacking. I can probably study everything by myself, watching some online courses and reading some books, but I need some recommendations.

I'm familiar to a certain degree with discrete math, probability and statistics, linear algebra. I had trouble understanding how a neural network work when I last checked it out, and I really want to dive more into AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

So, I really need some recommendations what and where to check before applying to the Masters degree (hopefully I get accepted with a good GRE score) - both Math and theoretical computer science. I like solving problems, so preferably books with exercises or practice exams included.

I come from a business background and currently have BS in management and I'm working on an MBA. My experience has mostly been in healthcare, where I now work in low-mid tier management. 

I am looking ahead to the next step in my career and after the MBA I want to pursue a skill as well. I've contemplated nursing, but the other route I would be interested in is technology.

I have experience and interest in managing projects. What kinds of degrees or certifications should I look into? When it's all said and done, I am a business type thinker but I would want to get the computer skills to bolster that. 

As far as current technological skills, I would essentially consider myself a proficient layperson. I have grown up using computers, databases and programs but I don't really know anything about what makes them tick.

I am an embedded engineer, so I am familiar with all low level programming stuff and I know all the fundamentals of CS and programming languages. This intro is just so that you know how deep to go with the answers to my question. I know basics of web design, HTML, CSS, JS and what a server needs to do, what the HTTP, TCP, IP protocols are meant for etc. 

I recently wanted to build a web app with a pretty GUI and a database on the back end. I don't want to use standard GUI based applications, like QT, because I want to learn something new, so I thought that a web app for local use only would have been a  fun start project. When I looked at the options I had I was super confused! 

I first wanted to use python and I found this library ""eel"" which starts a local server and uses google chrome to render the html page. You can then use JS  to communicate with your python module, which does the back end.

Then I discovered that Django is another python framework to work with python and web servers.

Then I discovered react (front) and node (backend).

Then I discovered Electron with seems to be built on top of node (??)

Then I discovered angularJS which seems to be a framework on its own. 

Let alone the thousands of small other pieces which I (still) don't know about: REST API, Ajax, query. Those are all names I read while investigating and that I kept unknown until I decide which way to go.

So is there anywhere a guide which describes all the tools used for building and the possible options/combinations? 

Thanks guys!!

P.S. I also found that all the courses I found online on web design are targeted at people who are not exactly developers, this pisses me off because they rarely use proper terms or play those silly musics on the background. But this was just a final rant, sorry :P",1,1

Not for a career shift, but I love to keep learning new stuff and constantly feeding my thoughts with brain-candy.

I would really love to get my feet really dirty. Currently, I have been reverse-engineering Angular, and I have contributed to it a few items. So, I am actually looking more into reverse-engineering (and hopefully contributing) to whatever projects are out there (i.e. TensorFlow) and open my mind for new thoughts/experiences.

I have finished a couple of books/courses on the essential mathematics I need for this journey, but I want to learn more about the point where everything meets.

Topics like:
---
- Studying the algebraic/statistical heart of TensorFlow
- How TensorFlow or any of its layers (Keras) talks with the GPU and how that can be improved?
- Advanced tensor (matrix) manipulations/implementations and how they actually work under the hood
- Implementing a small ML library on my own

I don't really like asking, I usually try to find everything on my own, but, I feel lost actually.

Here are some of the books that I have finished for anyone who is interested:
---
- Linear Algebra Done Right
- Matrix Computations
- Applied Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis
- The Book of Why
- Linear Algebra and Geomtry
- The Elements of Statistical Learning
- and more on statistics and theory

This post is very hard to write but I want to put it out there to seek advice from experts.

I graduated Computer Science from Asian country (private university) back in 2012. I was not serious about it then. I was a bright student but fell on bad path later. As of now, I am working part-time security guard job in Canada to meet my needs.  


Since then, I have burning desire to give my last shot to it and complete the dream of calling myself a Software Developer. To this day, I visit DistroWatch and try different linux distributions. I spend time learning JavaScript frameworks, Front End Development on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

I am seeking advice from experts on how can I redeem myself and get back to learning/building a career in CS? Should I do part-time learning on the side for a year and follow online courses? Is it possible if I can revisit University courses online like Data structures, Databases, Networking, OS?

Reasoning

Reasoning is tricky cause ai doesnt know shit for sure if it doesnt have input and calculations without input are cruical for decision making,especialy priority.U have to draw radiuses min max if u want precision on translation(movement)pathfinding with weights is good but u need to divide and conquer cause u cant run pathfinding on large area and u have to run it a lot of times regulary especialy on new input or output.Interest can help determine probability cloud in an area but u have to account for new events and baits.Bait can be predicted when something is out of interest of living beings double bait when time for objective on ""better solution"" is to good for robot and bad for humans(based on location for example).Distraction bait when u calculate what opponent doesnt want u to do and bait takes ""realistic time"" or longer and times differentiate between cloud of probability for thing they dont want robot to do and bait.

Its important to establish interest and how it manifests itself.For example if u avoid killing people u avoid translating things into their body or excessive input on their bodies in different ways.

Excessive input can be calculated as things done by people(or other beings) that hurt (input of unusual movement for example)them but dont happen inside simulation.

Past is important factor here cause even if thing is translated near(projectile) past can determine intention.

Interest can be simple like love,survival ( like sub can be need to belong ,power ,money ,health)

Love can also be part of survival but design of spreeding genes doesnt help u survive but your kids.So its important factor even if it increases health.Health can be linked to increased perfomance for calculations.

i could list alot of situations but the point is that u have to generalize a bit then based on micro actions u feine things u dont understand.Scientific thinking which takes separate thread or processor deals with thing not logical by simulations where u have to question certain things and define new one with as little attributes as u can cause ure just have a bloating mess.

For no input red data on electronic devices about certain things like people u go with geographic data based on accumulation of things of interest or u can skip and avoid it in calculations if u dont have any.

if u include it in calculations u screw up the systemcause u get to many error in decision making (this might be less obvious).

Priorities are very important in reasoning cause they can decide success or failure.U generaly want to avoid more risky decisions but its unaviodable cause ai doesnt know everything.U need to caclulate things on a fly for redecisions (adjustments),giving up on a desicion(part of an objective single or many depends how u program it)is generaly bad idea unless the effect is negative (bait).U usualy want to adjust and avoid switching to alternatives especialy to late cause u have different stats(location effects on body etc) and things generaly need to be precalculated which could falls into adjustment category.Time is an factor but bigger factor is conflict of interest,effect of threat can be actualy calculated without any data on it based on ""logic"" of simulation.

Data from that can be established and fed into database.For example experiencing an explosion,purpose of actions(translating circular object when interest is harm at low speed could potentially be harmles unless there is uncertainty of possible chemical reaction and act on ""doing"" something with the object to avoid self harm or object being activated based on movement time or enviroment attributes)can help u determine the goal of decision or simply decision of other living being or effect of an simulation(robot running from lava cause of heat as a thread aswell reduced visibility large amount of mass and etc-u run simulation of impact on a fly to determine effect).

Priorities are such as time,distance(difficulty lots of conflict),other beings in area and enviroment simulations all can be generalized into other and expanded by calculations if u do them with uncertanty based on very primitive rules and not expand those more when calculating,depends how u want to do it.

 

Ai input

Its separated by physics simulation and prediction of living beings since they dont obide laws.

Living things have more iregular shape,structure of bones is relevant to be calculated and can be determined by shading of skin or if with clothes by running cloth simulation,calculating shape of body then determining where bone lie based on ""uplifting"".For all that u need to determine the shape of body ull gonna calculate.Double camera (like eyes) help alot in that prediction otherwise u have to rely more on movement.Beings tend to have rigged surface noisy texture prolongated(depends on a being) based on shape of a being.Math for simulation is already there it will be wrong to a degree cause of hardware so u ll gonna have mistakes but with time those mistakes show so if u recalculate

the decision making of output shouldnt be to bad if u think mistakes would ""grow"".Structure of being also has to be determined cause some dont rely on bones but have shell or bone less structure.

Visual input is probably the hardest.

Other input may be sound,transfer of data via electromechanical waves(option of hacking or sniffing)

thermal data(bad at distance but can help in close encounters) .

This would belong to reasoning but it s worth saying that all data not made logical by simulations is produced or is human.Things produced by humans tend to have purpose linked to interests,strange textures that dont make sense when time is a factor(cause maintenence-sign of human activity nearby in time scale) .Things made by human are not alive cause they still run by simulation just illogical to exist ""normaly"".

Other input could be vibrations like explosion but its kinda nonsense cause u can blow input device and still confirm such event via visual sound or thermal.

Dust(smoke) as a problem in determining beings can be removed on delta time with simulation.

Things on camera such as dust become obvious very quickly since they stay relativly same position during movement and distance calculations are ""wrong"" for it.

 

Misconceptions about agi.

Robots dont know things for sure there is probability of mistake when predicting living beings

and what they do if u dont have input.There is lack of precision in simulations cause of hardware

but u can tune that how u like to a degree.

robots dont have to be ruthless it all dpends who writes politics for action which are there to limit

stuff like skynet happening ,or something u dont want which is spoken alot in safety of ai.

robots need to be a generalist and to reduce having to many of them which would increase cost and

all have their vulnerabilities they need to have a shape of a human or to some degree depends

what is their basis of movement what materials they are made of and etc.

robots can be destroyed by high powered weapons explosives missiles since they cant act perfectly since they dont know everything and estimation has to be decided they can fall into traps or destroyed at distance by humans they are not invincible.

if they have to act fast the have to rely on fast decision making which i called instinct which can be wrong.so if u make one thats the tricky part.u have to decide stuff like priorities and radiuses of actions and interest.

robots dont evolve 20000 years in a week they ""prefer"" to do things cause thinking takes time and has high probability of ending nowhere to its more effective to just act.

robots can build other robots eaither from scratch or by having blueprints and copying code.

so being an ai engineer doenst make u special or a god.

u cant build robots solely with machine learning even if program can learn anything cause then it cant understand things ,u cant run infinite simulations on life especialy since its changing and same situation may never occur again.Even if u generalize some things its still far to little weights to be effective,if u generalize to much then u have useless shit.",7,0

Puzzle 1: You are given a list of 100 claims.....

P1 - At least 1 of the claims in the list is false
P2 - At least 2 of the claims in this list are false
P3 - At least 3 of the claims in this list are false

Pn- At least n of the claims in this list are false

P100 - At least 100 of the claims in this list are false

Can you assign truth values to these claims so that they are consistent? If this is possible, which of the claims are true (if any) and which are false (if any)?

Puzzle 2: You are given a second list with the first 99 claims from the first list:

P1 - At least 1 of the claims in this list is false
P2 - At least 2 of the claims in this list are false
P3 - At least 3 of the claims in this list are false

Pn - At least n of the claims in this list are false

P99 - At least 99 of the claims in this list are false

First question is on a MIPS system, how big is the bit width per memory address? because teacher mentioned that a ""word"" is 4 bytes, and so you have to take 4 memory address? why does a word is specific 32 bits? isn't it based on the number of characters? like ""BOBBY"" have 6 characters therefore 6 of 8 bit characters therefore 5 bytes require from memory to register?

Sorry if this is confusing, but i asked the same question to instructor, and he mention doesnt matter how many characters they are, its always 32 bit per word? am i missing something here.

It'll be mini game where you have to input the correct answer in a hangman/jeopardy style.

my **MAIN** question here is - What are some important key terms or overall things someone in CS  ( a beginner like me) should know **OR** some fundamental knowledge.

With the question above, I plan on it helping me learn new things &amp; also (if allowed to) use the questions/terms for the project i want to want to create (will credit).

Soo... if anyone wants to drop some knowledge i'd be more than thankful and hopefully it isn't a problem if i were to use your question in my project :b

I'm hoping for other new people to use my project (once complete) to help them learn in a fun/creative way.

\- To be clear -

* I'm asking for key terms or things that are overlooked in CS but are pretty important/good to know - which will be for me to take note on, but if you allow ; I would use them for my project.
* I'm not asking for help with coding as i intend to do ***everything from scratch myself.***

Thank you all &lt;3 

\- If I'm unclear with things sorry : please say",9,0

I'm a CS student and I've read recently Mark Weiser's paper. He talks mainly about ubiquitous computing. I loved the paper btw.

I want to discuss some concepts that he talks about. I know that it's a paper from 1997 but still, it's a good one. 

Please, read the paper here:

[https://www.ics.uci.edu/\~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf)

It's really worth, and it's just 8 pages long. 

Now you've read it. Let's talk :)

So, IoT is the ubiquitous computing that he was talking about, right? At first, I thought of cellphones, but those still have 'a demanding focus of attention', the screen. But IoT, those are devices that we do not *see,* I see a coffee machine not a computer, I see a better fridge, a better clock, a better oven. Not computers. Those *disappeared*.

He talked about pads or tabs. We can say that these are today's smartphones and tablets, right? And the boards, we may think of them as today's smart TVs, but a big screen is just not that popular. But today smartphones, smart TVs and tablets are still not a form of ubiquitous computing so... quite similar but not exactly what he thought.

I think that the network that Mark describes here is already invented:

&gt;Present technologies would require a mobile device to have three different network connections: tiny range wireless, long range wireless, and very high speed wired. A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented.

4G. 5G. If I misunderstood let me know. 

Here's the final paragraph of the paper: 

&gt;There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system, yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating. Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.

I think that this is yet to happen. And that will always be like that because technologies evolve so fast that the majority of society just can't catch up. 

Maybe ubiquitous computing is not even possible. It's just a utopic concept. And trying to get to that utopic place where computers vanished into the background will make great things happen, even if we never get there. 

Or maybe ubiquitous computing isn't good at all. What do you think?

I'm amazed by how he talks about things that we see today, before those things ever existed! 

Any insight from the paper, please comment :)

PS: I hope to upload some interviews with some CS Doctors of my Uni or simply a blog post about ubiquitous computing somehow soon. Thanks for taking the time of reading this, I know it's long :)",5,54

So please someone help me make a clear decision. Is cs for me? Am I going to do well in it? I don't have indepth about cs knowledge to make a decision. Are there any questions that i should ask myself before and while making a decision? Oh and just for no reason other majors in which I'm interested are healty sciences, information systems and chemical engineering. And throughout highschool I was good at all the subjects pretty much I could get good grades in any subjects if I put my mind into it and decided to study but the subject i thought I had a hard time learning and remembering was biology. That's because I never really put much effort into it. I was better than average in math. I thought i was good at chem but my grades were just average or above average and I thought i was horrible in physics but i somehow got good grades in it so idk anymore what I'm actually good at.

Researching shit makes me all hot and bothered. I think this is a type of monad, honestly no idea.) for a video game.

The type contains an event, i.e. pick up x, walk left, path to coords, etc; along with a bit of contextual information such as who's participating in the event, when it takes place, and so on. Ideally, I can use this system to assist in AI control and to memoize bits of decision making.

As a usability thing, I'd like to be able to easily convert events in such a way that I can take several ""move"" events and make a path event or vice versa. However, certain events wouldn't really have relavent conversions, like converting a pickup to a move or whatever.

There's like 50 billion different ways to do this, but events are going to be a pretty critical part of my game and I want to make sure I do it right. Ideally I'd want to be able to do it on the fly, so I was thinking of creating a few helper methods on my event container, but having a pickup event that has a to\_path() method seems like it might be a bit dirty. idk... I just want to make sure I start this right, before getting too ahead of myself.

If anyone has any reading suggestions, it would be much appreciated.

PS: not terribly relevant, but these event containers are kinda bare bones. a path\_to event contains a type(""path\_to"") and a destination(""coords""), an entity reference, and occasionally a starting location; later on this information is acted upon based on world context and player location; the generated path \*usually\* won't be contained in the event container (unless I'm memoizing it, the point is that information is intended to be extrapolated on demand).

PSS:

I'm starting to think it might be a good idea to create individual event types, that would be contained inside the container. Maybe the best thing to do would be to take my current event container, turn it into a universal type, extend the individual event types from it; and then create a monad for containing event arrays and the helper methods?",3,1

First let me explain my intention clearly:

I'm a grad student who studies in operation research and **really dedicated** to work on TSP. I **really want to understand and digest** the idea of TSP so that I can understand papers, articles, research and at the final analyzing them with my experience and knowledge for shaping my own research question from my own perspective as a fresh researcher. Say, comparing solution methods or analyzing solutions, proposing some new hybrid way of solving etc.

Some information about me:

I have basic knowledge in python and statistics. I can write simple scripts, plotting data, automate everyday task and so. I have fair knowledge in statistics, have worked with linear regressions and others but haven't experienced any AI methods like dynamic programming, heuristic approaches, genetic algorithms, nature based optimization algorithms. Shortly I know nothing about advanced algorithms.

For that reason I feel something is missing **for grasping the idea better** and I think that is **because of hands-on experience.** At this moment I feel lost. Don't know where to start and which path to take! Also I'm afraid that this path could take a long time to comprehend and also afraid of it may prevent me to reach my goal which is writing my thesis and getting my graduation in limited time. I can't predict the pros and cons of this trade-off. 

Anyways, my question is:

If you have any recommendation for nailing that topic(TSP) in reliable manner of time please let me know. Any book books, videos, online course and all other alternative ways of learning methods would be appreciated. When I checked the Udemy courses, it seems to me too much time like I mean there is series of courses and each course is like 2 hours and of course I'm not sure about what it is providing. If there is better tutorial you've experienced let me know.

Thanks in advance.",18,2

I recently graduated from undergrad and have been working as a software engineer for about two months now. Up until about junior year of college, I had always wanted to go into research and be on the forefront developing and discovering. Things have really changed in the last two years as I have been struggling with, among other things, what I want to do with my life.

At the same time data science was an interest of mine throughout college for which I had a few internships. Working as a software engineer, I've been feeling the ""what if"" feeling coming over me recently. I wonder if I should have continued on data science and gone to grad school. As graduate scholarships are getting closer, it feels like a do or die moment. I don't feel like I'm ready to go back to school or even if I fully know what I want to do but it feels like if I don't apply not, I'll have wasted another year waiting hoping for some sign or something. 

I found data science interesting but, having done internships, I never felt like I enjoyed it in practice and likely liked the idea of it more than the actual practice of gathering, cleaning, and aimlessly wandering through data. I wonder if that's because I wasn't prepared for the work or if it's just not a good fit.

We're three paragraphs in and I'm already all over the place. I'll just make a list of why I think I should go to grad school and why I shouldn't and would love it if some of you with experience could share your insights as I work towards making this decision

Go to grad school:
- Study deeper into topics I'm interested in. I used to enjoy studying and exploring topics in data science and ml in my free time during school and it felt like I enjoyed it then
- Having that opportunity to build my skill set and knowledge
- possibly actually get into research (despite starting and failing a few times in undergrad because I wasn't sure)
- getting a higher degree
- fulfill a long lived dream of pursuing higher education if not a PhD. Not to mention my parents'
- I already asked professors for recommendations, started an application for a scholarship, and reached out to my advisor for help. If I just drop it now, I'll just feel like a quitter. Would they help me in the future if I just stop after they have said yes
- it'll just get harder and harder to go as I keep working and am acclimated to the work lifestyle

Why not go:
- I don't honestly know what tangible benefits I'll get from it
- not even sure if data science is for me (but I guess after 3 years of undergrad and two internships around data, if I don't know yet, will I ever)
- during my internships, as well as some data analysis on currently doing at my job, I've felt like I don't quite enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It honestly feels like I'm blind and just swinging my hands around looking for something but not sure what
- I could continue to work and build my career at my current company which is growing quickly
- it feels like I'm applying more because the deadline is coming/if not now then when and less because it feels like I'm ready or I need it

I clearly don't have a strong case for why I should but I don't feel like I'll know for sure unless I at least try and, who knows, I could want to go in half a year by which point it would be too late.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a note; this is probably NOT a monad. It's coded in GDScript, which is a python-y language that doesn't support first class functions; and there are a few idiosyncrasies that might disqualify it.

    class Action:
        #This is a container class for my functions. It calls func ""name"" with ""arguments"".

            #without going into implementation details new_action will equal a new action that
            #represents self.action applied to an entity followed by action applied to that entity.
            #FYI; the implementation details would also disqualify this a monad probably.

The other option is going to the Tri-Cities area in Washington and attending WSU Tri-Cities and kind of starting from scratch. I've done some research and both UCSB and Cal Poly seem to be pretty well known and have good CS departments. WSU didn't seem as good but overall not a bad school to go to either, while ive read the school you go to doesn't matter as much. I saw that WSU will only teach C/C++ curriculum. When I looked into the language I found a lot of contradictory information about whether or not it's dying as a major programming language. So my main question is how much truth is there in some of this information. Is C/C++ still viable in the industry or is it slowly going away? Should it be a deciding factor in my decision of where to go? Also if anyone has attended these schools, what was your experience during and after obtaining your degree?

And I shared them with some colleagues at my company.

We realized that PWAs can be goldmines for tech companies, since they can really lift several business metrics.

For example:

* [West Elm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgW-0M67TQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=36m2s)s PWA implementation earned a 15% increase in time spent and a 9% lift in revenue.
* [Flipkart](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/flipkart), Indias largest e-commerce site, tripled time spent on the site and drove 40% higher reengagement.
* [AliExpress](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/aliexpress), part of the massive Chinese platform Alibaba, saw conversion rates for new users increase by 104%.

But given the continued momentum and increased support from both Android and iOS, brands have been slow to take advantage of the benefits.

# Why Progressive Web Apps are Websites That Took All The Right Vitamins

PWAs can bring native app-like experiences and functionality to the mobile web, and they can be an extremely efficient way to deliver your digital experiences.

But as with many new technologies, the devil is in the details:

* How app-like are we talking about?
* Exactly what features and functionality are possible?
* Are they fully cross-platform?
* Should I replace my native app with a PWA?

These and many more questions are common as business and technology leaders consider the implications on their mobile user engagement strategies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's Define PWAs in a Sentence**

Its hard to find a very detailed, comprehensive and universally agreed-upon definition of PWA, but a [quote](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-101-the-what-why-and-how-4aa5e9065ac2) from Alex Russell (who, together with Frances Berriman, coined the term progressive web apps) gives us a good starting point.

*Progressive Web Apps are just websites that took all the right vitamins.*

To get  more specific, PWAs can offer certain functionality that is typically associated with native applications. For example:

* Near instantaneous loading (on the second visit)
* Installed on the home screen, like an app icon
* Remove browser chrome / navigation creating a full-screen experience
* Offline access
* Push notifications

# PWAs vs. Native Apps: The Wrong Comparison

Maybe simply because the A in PWA stands for app, too much discussion around PWAs focuses on comparing and contrasting to native mobile applications. We believe this comparison (and the accompanying discussion) is misguided.

**PWAs are absolutely not a universal replacement for native apps.**

The only experiences we believe in are the compelling customer experiences that bring people back time after time. And if your native app experience meets this bar then it should most certainly continue to exist.

These experiences tend to have some common characteristics:

* They address high-frequency use cases such as financial services;
* They are leveraging low-level hardware integrations or operating system features not supported by the web and/or are focused on doing so in the future;
* There is a need (or perceived benefit) for heightened security

If your existing native app experience doesnt check at least one of these boxes above then we recommend reconsidering whether or not it should continue to exist.

If it doesnt have the frequency of use or doesnt require low-level access to device hardware not available to browsers, then what value do they have?

These apps  lets call them vanity apps  are the most likely candidates to be replaced by PWAs over time.

# PWA vs. Mobile Web: The Right Conversation You Should Have

We recommend the conversation concentrate on how PWAs are a huge upgrade to the responsive mobile web.

As shared earlier, there is no shortage of published case studies from nearly every industry vertical highlighting significant improvement across a wide variety of KPIs after PWA implementation.

What are the underlying factors driving these performance improvements?

Google uses a helpful acronym for us to understand why PWAs are so effective: FIRE  Fast, Integrated, Reliable, and Engaging.

**1 / FAST**

By enabling background processing, which accelerates page load time tremendously, PWAs deliver a much faster experience.

We all know that speed is important:

On a mobile device, even a 1-second delay can increase the bounce rate by almost 50% and decrease conversion by 20%.

Walmart famously found that for every 100 milliseconds of improvement to page load time, there was up to a 1% increase in incremental revenue.  [Tinder](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0) cut its load time from roughly 12 seconds down to five seconds using a PWA.

**2 / INTEGRATED**

Using an ever-evolving set of web capabilities, PWAs integrate more tightly with native hardware than regular web sites. They ultimately feel more like a native app from a user experience perspective  seamless and integrated.

**3 / RELIABLE**

Caching isnt just about speed; its about providing access either offline or in limited network and connection environments.

**4 / ENGAGING**

Speed and reliability drive increased user engagement. And, as noted previously, PWAs also facilitate sending push notifications, helping to drive ongoing engagement with the experience.

[Lancome](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/lancome) saw a 12 % increase in conversion rates on recovered carts via Push Notifications.

(Additional case studies can be found in Googles Developer Portal and at [PWAstats.com](https://PWAstats.com).)

Another key benefit to PWA is its **discoverability:**

It exists on the web, just like any other website, and can be found via major search engines, social shares, and links from other websites.

The fact that it removes the barrier of having to go to one of the native app stores to find, authenticate and install the application prior to using it means its ultimately easier to integrate it as part of your content, paid and social strategies.

# What we learnt

PWAs are powerful, effective, fast and app-like.

Its hard to imagine a mobile web property that could not be significantly improved via PWA implementation. They can also potentially eliminate the need for many vanity native apps that exist today.

In short, now is the time to integrate these technologies into your ecosystem of customer touchpoints.

I list [here](https://ymedialabs.com/progressive-web-apps) some real-world examples and a long list of resources on PWAs, if you'd like to have a look.",33,106

I am transitioning out of the military and have taken an intelligence position within the DC area. My background is in all source intelligence with both conventional and special operations teams in my tenure. I plan on going to school while working in my new intel position, and have started looking into cyber security.

My job deploys 4 months out of the year so I am leaning toward an online degree, and a few schools I have found offer a cyber security degree fully online. Is there any negative side to doing a cyber security degree online rather than in person? George Mason University is the one I am looking at specifically, but am open to other schools as well.

I also wasn't sure how difficult a cyber security degree would be to someone like myself who really has no experience in it. I never spent any time doing cyber intel or in that community whatsoever, all my experience has been supporting special ops and other combat units.

This is not to say I am afraid to dive into the cyber security realm, but I would also like it to translate to the intelligence community so I can remain in this field of work after I graduate.

Is there anything I can do at a novice level (classes, seminars, etc.) to see if this cyber security thing isn't way over my head?

My goal is to learn how these TUIs work and reproduce a working and fully functional equivalent in the Unity game engine for a current project.

From my current understanding, text mode displays characters inside of cells contained in a grid. We will call this grid of cells the screen buffer. Its common that a screen buffer is 80x25 in size. For a screen size of 640x200 you can exactly fit a screen buffer with the size of 80x25 in it given that the character cells in the buffer are 8x8 pixels in size. My confusion is what happens if the resolution is larger than 640x200? Do the rows and column sizes stay the same and the cell size in pixels increase? Or are more rows and columns added to accommodate the larger screen resolution?

Lets use Windows command prompt as an example. While not being a terminal emulator the same principles of displaying text still apply. The screen buffer for command prompt is not based on the screen size but is based on the container size of the window. So resizing the window of command prompt doesnt alter the size of the screen buffer but instead alters what part of the buffer is currently being displayed. How does command prompt handle being resized? Command prompt doesnt cut off text or show half of it. Command prompt wont draw a line if it is not fully visible. How exactly is this done in a TUI?

Sorry if my question seems a little confusing. What Im wanting to do is be able to recreate a fully working TUI in Unity or even in WinForms that displays text like command prompt does or even computers in text mode.",13,0

So, my question is same as what I put on the title : IS vim REALLY CONVENIENT?

I want your HONEST answers, and I will be glad if you give me any advise on this matter.

Thank you.",18,4

After a lot of research I came to the conclusion of studying CS (Informatik) in TU Munich, since I'm already really good at maths  , have good logical thinking and love working with computers. My goal isn't just to finish my bachelor and start working as a software engineer in any German company, but rather travel to the US and work on security systems for big companies, trying to prevent them from getting hacked. I have a dream of working in Silicon Valley as a cyber security engineer in one of the biggest tech companies. Yesterday I just found out, a bachelor in cyber security does exist in Germany but not in TU Munich. The only two universities I was able to find, that offer this bachelor are the university of Bonn and the ""Uni des Saarlandes"". My problem both of these universities aren't really top universities and don't have as many correlations (if any) with foreigner companies in the US, unlike the TU Munich, which is ranked in the top 30 universities for CS worldwide. Sooo... does it make more sense to study CS in TU Munich and then master Cyber Security afterwards or is it more logical to start off with a bachelor in Cyber Security in a ""weaker University"". I've also found a pretty interesting Master study, namely ""Entrepreneurial Cyber Security"". It would be great to start my own business after working at top notch companies and gaining experience.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf)

Abstract:

Recent  methods generalize convolutional layers from Euclidean domains to  graph-structured data by approximating the eigenbasis of the graph  Laplacian. The computationally-efficient and broadly-used Graph ConvNet  of Kipf &amp; Welling, over-simplifies the approximation, effectively  rendering graph convolution as a neighborhood-averaging operator. This  simplification restricts the model from learning delta operators, the  very premise of the graph Laplacian. In this work, we propose a new  Graph Convolutional layer which mixes multiple powers of the adjacency  matrix, allowing it to learn delta operators. Our layer exhibits the  same memory footprint and computational complexity as a GCN. We  illustrate the strength of our proposed layer on both synthetic graph  datasets, and on several real-world citation graphs, setting the record  state-of-the-art on Pubmed.",0,1

But those few who do, really must have a passion for it. It's not a subject that one can pick up on any day and just excel at it. It requires time, patience, and most importantly, practice. Coding/programming (however you want to call it), is not the only part that makes up the subject of CS. That's the wonderful thing about it. There's so much to 'Computer Science' than what meets the eye. Sure, in school you may only learn about coding in C++, C#, Java, or even Python. This isn't easy either. It requires creative and logical thinking. You cant just memorize answers. You can **only** answer questions if you have **logical reasoning and thinking.** To all the people who are thinking of taking CS as a major in Uni, think twice. You may think that it may be easy. But, if you have passion for the subject, **go for it.** There's nothing more satisfying that a completed code that does exactly what it should do. Other aspects of computer science which includes ITGS (Information Technology on Global Society) also discusses about AI, hardware components which have technology within them. There is a plethora of choices to pick up in computer science. You could do AI, System Fundamentals, Software development, and lastly, my favorite, and the one which I am going to do in Uni - Game Development. The possibilities are endless.

I hope you all enjoy learning, creating, coding, and exploring the subject as much as I do.
