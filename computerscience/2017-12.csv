It claims to connect physics to a thermal universal Turing machine.

We suggest and formalize an alternative approach to understand the universe in which a large blob of irreducible facts, rather than a small list of axioms, define the theory. The blob of facts is given a physical interpretation when it is structured as a Gibbs ensemble. In the case where the facts are logically verifiable, the Gibbs ensemble describes a thermal universal Turing machine which spawns the whole system. The Lagrange multipliers of the partition function are the Planck units. The background, a thermal spacetime, emerges as a consequence of the limits applicable to the conjugate pairs. The background obeys Special and General relativity, dark energy, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, the Schrdinger equation and the Dirac equation.

-Engaging and demands knowing how to do things in order to not be lost. This is kind of important to me as I feel it'd force me to study / know what I'm doing or I wouldn't have a clue how to do anything.

I want to preface my post by saying I know a lot of the answers I seek can be found with a quick Google search or on the sidebar, but I like the idea of knowing another human answered my questions in this moment.


I am 23/F and have struggled to find the right stem related major for me, and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting too old to not have transfered to university yet. :( I silently declared astronomy, went to physics, then mechanical/aerospace engineering and I'm finding it hard to admit that physics is just not for me. My first semester of physics was so difficult, and I just hated it. I love working hard and I find myself excited for challenges but my physics class broke me a bit too much.


Buried in me is my interest in coding so I have been quietly stalking comp Sci. I am brand spanking new to the subject though (unless you count html, which I enjoyed to pieces when i was younger) My questions are as follows (no one is required to answer ALL of them):


TlDR:


1. How can I teach myself c++ in preparation for a course? The professors at my college are warned to be terrible and students are advised to teach themselves. Do you guys have any recommendations for online lectures or anything interactive and *structured*? If you feel another more basic language in more beneficial to start with, which do you recommend? 


2. Is it wrong to assume comp Sci is based on memorizing/knowing various coding languages or is there more math and physics than I might think there is? 


3. What is the difference between computer science, software engineering, and computer science and engineering? (this is a bit specific but I saw them on assist.org when I searched for comp Sci) I am interested in programming and working with code the most.


4. For those who did not think they would be comp Sci majors right out of high school (and I suppose people who did know, as well) what made you go into comp Sci? What makes you excited about it? As someone who did not grow up being good at math and science, do you think I can still enjoy comp Sci? (I have taken 6 math classes to get to Calc 3 so I am not afraid of math anymore)

Essentially I am trying to translate this code into MIPs:

   
        for(i = 0; i &lt; 5; i = i + 1)
    	for(j = 0; j &lt; (i+1); j = j + 1)

I believe I have everything set up properly, besides:

    array3[i] += array2[j]

Infact, if I could confirm that that line is doing what I think it should be that would be quite helpful.

I believe i+= is equivalent to i++ (incrementing by 1), and this is essentially saying index j of array3 is going to equal to... the next index in array2? 

I am honestly a little confused by this line, is more than one element being added per iteration, or is it *just* one?

Beyond that I believe my MIPs is correct, but could be wrong as we have not used it all that much in this course, if anything looks out of place please let me know.

I also commented  each line of the cosde above to the corresponding line in MIPs to help identify if it is set up properly:

I didn't study computer science and I was wondering how valuable pop-science explanations of topics like AI are.

I've noticed that it's a topic that's often addressed by people who actually don't work in the field and became sort of mainstream. Discussions about AI or deep learning are everywhere.

For example I listened to a TED talk by Sam Harris on the danger of AI:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg and he also talks about it in the joe rogan podcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChxQHyFIOI
I thought it was interesting but I'm also sort of suspicious, without making any accusations. But as far as I know he doesn't really have any credentials which would make him an expert for AI.

Is this something computer scientists laugh about or do you guy actually appreciate it because it improves a layman's understanding of what some of you are doing? Is he sticking to the consensus of experts or is there something inaccurate? I realize that nobody will watch a 20 minute talk to answer my question, I hope some people already have an opinion.

[Here is my code](https://gist.github.com/robrousejr/1175dc358b6aa9b8443d01f4d795c951)

I need to:

* Whenever a user participates in an activity that users ID is input into one of the four arrays. For example, if user 49193 signs on for a stationary bike (activity 1), they are input into the next available slot in the stationary bike array. Lets say that user ID 49193 is input into number 3, the index value of 2, in the stationary bike array. Then the next request for a stationary bike should place the new user into the 4th slot (index 3), and so on. This was the expected behavior for all of the arrays. Your program would fill up the arrays until full, and then start overlaying the users thereafter, starting at the front again (index 0) until reaching the back again (index 18).

* The next part adds to your menu logic the ability for the arrays to be printed. Thus, you will add an option to the menu as Print Activity Usage. This will assume the option 6, and option 7 will be added to support End. Dont forget to change all the parts of your program, such as validation, to incorporate this change.

* Finally, you should have another function that will print the array information and appropriately format the output (ex: should dispay &gt; bikes in use/total 3/19

* Load the activities into static arrays (Activity 1 (1-19 people), Act. 2 (1-15), Act. 3 (1-24), Act. 4 (1-33 Ppl)

Tried two internships, BMET and Bio Lab, it just isn't for me.

Why I ~~can't~~ don't want to transfer to CS B.E. My school offers all second year engineering courses once a year, meaning if you fail a single course, that's it. If you want to transfer to another program, it's too much.

Transferring to a CS major would literally destroy what's left of my youth. I wouldn't be able to take core classes at the right times of the year for me, relative to when I transfer, nor be able to dedicate myself in the summers. I would have to start from scratch, for another 3 years (excluding first year of common courses). Had to start light Python and ML for my third years BME labs, and I really like it. Contemplated it for the past few months and I can see myself possibly enjoying CS, as sadistic as it is to say.

This might be the incorrect thread to post this, but i thought i would start here and see where it goes.

I am currently pursuing my masters in computer science with a focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data-mining, Cloud Computing,Computer Vision, ETC.  I also currently work as a professional software engineer in embedded systems, spending most of my days in C.

I really enjoy working in a C/C++/C# Windows environment and enjoy full stack development. After I finish my masters degree, I would like to pursue a career where I can combine my interest in the environment I enjoy with my new found knowledge from my degree, but I am not sure if the path i want to go down even exists. 

It seems like most machine learning type jobs are either in python, R, or Java environments and from the outside, they look more like data scientist jobs rather than engineering type jobs. It is really hard to tell what a job might be like because the descriptions are pretty vague.

I know as a computer scientist I should not be so picky as to what environment I work in, I guess this is more of a preference I have and if possible I would like to make it happen.

I am curious if anyone knows of companies that develop machine learning software in a c++/c# windows environment? It seems rare to me, but maybe i am wrong. Most companies seem to be developing in java or python

I am currently working on a larger web project. My idea: 
I have a simple html/css user interface, which asks the user for specific input. This input should then be passed to a java servlet via javascript.
The user input is not saved anywhere. It is merely used as input for a rather complex algorithm which runs on the server. After the algorithm is done, the result is sent back to the front-end and presented to the user.

Now my question: As I'm not using a database, is it worth running the algorithm on the server side? That means, all the operations I do could potentially also be done solely on the client side. But would that be a good idea? That would mean running the algorithm in Javascript and making its runtime user device-dependent. 

I am quite new to web development, so all your thoughts on this are appreciated.

Today at work I casually pitched an idea to my boss for an algorithm that would automate communications/matches on a bulletin board that employees use to swap shifts. My boss asked if I could do it and I said yes, so he said he'd set up a meeting for us to discuss it.

I have some experience (a handful of internships in college) doing software development work and I completed most of the work for a bachelor's degree in Comp Sci (but didn't finish so right now I don't have a degree). I haven't done any development work in a couple years and my skills are extremely dusty. I was very excited about the prospect of finally doing some real development work, but when I told my boyfriend about it he mentioned that I should be asking to be paid more for it, which I hadn't even considered.

My thought process was this: I will be doing the development while at work and during that time I wouldn't be performing my normal job functions (taking calls), so essentially I would be getting paid my normal hourly rate but just for a different job temporarily. Also I'm psyched to be doing something I love and would happily do it for the same rate I currently make. And it would be a great addition to my resume which is worth enough to me that I'd probably do it for free.

I also feel that asking for a raise/bonus for the project would require a contract which means promising to deliver a quality product which I don't feel confident enough to promise.

But my boyfriend's argument is that this type of work is above my paygrade and that I'm selling myself short, or letting my company take advantage of me.

What do you think?

So, everyone's been complaining about it, and of the few people here who would like to fix it and switch to git, I'm the only one who has ever actually used git. So, it's fallen upon me (not by choice, tbh) to convince the rest of our team and my manager that git is the way to go.

This is a problem I've faced multiple times. 

As someone with a couple of years of programming experience in multiple languages, most websites that teach you a new language do so in a painfully boring manner.

They all follow the same basic pattern - how to declare variables, constants, how to write for loops, switch cases, structs, and then the last 4-5 chapters are dedicated to meaty stuff like Goroutines and Channels.

A chapter about, say, variables, is full of obscure specific rules you're never going to remember, as someone looking at the book/website for the first time.

This makes learning a new language a very dry experience. I've lost interest in a new language, say Haskell or Erlang, multiple times, because by the time I mow through the first 5 chapters, all I've learned is declaring variables and functions, but all my interest has been sapped out, with repetitive examples like fibonacci and factorials.

I randomly stumbled upon exercism.io, and I found it really cool!

* They have problem sets for all languages
* They have a CLI tool, which means you can fetch exercises, and upload solutions without leaving your terminal, unlike say, codeforces
* I assume there is some sort of graded difficulty, because the couple of problems I tried were 2-4 liners
* They encourage a system, where people can check out each other's submissions and see different ways to achieve the same thing. They encourage you to participate, and leave comments/suggestions on other people's solutions. No one seems to care much for the easier problems, I'm not sure how good the community support is for the harder ones.
* The problems are not algorithmic in nature. With algorithmic problems - you're only using basic primitives like arrays, loops and recursion, but the examples here require you to understand and interact with various libraries that come with the language.

Apologies if this is a fairly well-known platform, but I just came across it, and found it the best way to learn a new language as an experienced programmer.

On the other hand, I have an interview for another junior developer position. Making almost double the money that I am making now. Sounds like a good gig. I would be doing  development in the .net which is what I been doing for the past year in my current job. 

I guess my question is. Which job would you guys choose?

I would like to know the pros and cons of both career paths. I would appreciate it if you guys gave me some advice.

Thank you. 

P.S.
The reason why I am leaving my current job is because there is no room for growth in the company and the pay is extremely shitty. 

Thanks guys!!",2,6

Then I realised the card does not store anything - it's just that every card has slightly different indents so the machine can perform a check to determine which card is inserted. 

That got me thinking though, is has this relationship / concept been explored much in computer science or information theory? Though the card does not directly store information, it kind of  indirectly points to information which is stored on the machine. 

Is there a formal explanation of this approach? As opposed to storing  everything on the card itself?

1- exploring the pshycology behind the products; example when we use video games a lot we need to eleminate the feeling that we obtain from playing video games or listening to too much music, this could be justified by many factors such as how a music artist lives their lifes outside of the music world

2- money; if we resort to economy figures around different countries in the globe, we will see how the momey spent on computers and such by means of a month, year and tens of years, could be worth large sums of money, in that way we could make a simple calculation how to buy a Ferrari instead

3- Knowledge; we will explain and discuss the working mechnisims behaind all of these products, this should basically open doors for all computer users to start understanding the working motors of what they are using, that way in depth understanding of the technology across the globe will move people by knowing

4- employment and life time job: by now people should be able to really understand how do they spend their time with computers and how should they be able to understand all computer science without having to spend precious time using the products

I am myself is a such person and I hope we make change,

I am looking for people that together using online groups we hope we can make a high elite professional project that will cover all these topics in depth and bring change to people's lifes, There are extreme amount of work to do and I can't wait entil we start,

Our first step should be to define a working startegy for the project, how members should communicate together, how to discuss ideas, rules and long terms philosophy and such, I will be heading the project, we will make it fully free and available of all of it sections to whom ever needs any bit of it, we will construct an agreement policy if we see this project picks up

I don't understand what a framework is, full stack, front end, back end, javascript, etc. Is there a really big overview in a book or article that can teach me what each of these means and how they are applied? Then once I understand what it is, I can do my own research and learn the language or framework myself and code it.

Edit 1: I'm not trying to look for specific definitions because I could just google them. I was just hoping if there was something that could explain software development on a broad overview level and all the aspects of it so I can get a good foundation. So this way when I pursue further research and studies or just when I browse reddit, I'd have a general idea of what people are talking about. ",7,4

""Give a simple example of the difference good and poor load balancing can make?""

I know that load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives and that load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. But I cannot come up with any simple examples of the sort.

I'm currently working on a private project based on electron and angular4. As the frameworks suggest, it is meant to be a desktop application and therefore I would like to store application data (not just user preferences) locally on the disk. To keep it ""simple"" I wanted to use an embedded database, so I would not have to start a local server every time I use the application. I tried out nedb, which looked really promising. Unfortunately it is no longer actively worked on so some bugs are a pain in the ass. So I switched over to sqlite3 which seems a little overkill for my usecase.

&gt;""Master/Slave is superficially quite similar to manager/worker also called &gt;""bag of tasks"". In this, there is a global set of problems to process held by &gt;the manager and the workers request a problem from the manager as they &gt;need. This allows easy load balancing on the workers.""

It's for software called beel1ne reader

 beel1nereader DOT com

(replace 1 with i )

It cost money, and it's pretty simple concept, so I tried to look for a free version. 

I think it's heavily enforced because I can not find a single instance of a app/extension/program that applies a color gradient to text. 

Usually anytime someone comes up with a good app idea, you'll see dozens of copycats within a year. This concept has been out since 2011, 

The thing is, it's such an easy thing to code, probably one of the easier things to copy. Yet there's no other apps that have the same function. 

Does this mean that if I code something that applies a color gradient to text, and release it on github, I could get sued?
