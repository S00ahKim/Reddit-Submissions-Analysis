In my algorithms &amp; data structures class we spent a lot of time studying linked lists, queues and stacks, but we never got to the green part of data structures: trees.

I've been trying to implement an AVL tree, but always end up crashing and burning (already tried doing it in C, ObjC, Python and about to start with Swift).

I already know the basics of btrees, but they are all unbalanced.
My two questions:

- Of all the balancing tree structures, which one would you implement first and why?

- Can you suggest some resource that I can tackle on and try to figure it out on my own?


Thank you all!",2,1

I've just recently discovered this subreddit so I figured I'd get your opinions on something I've been thinking about.  

First, a little background on me:  

I began my undergrad studies as an Electrical and Computer Engineering major, but after doing that for 2 years, I decided I wasn't as interested in the material as I had expected. So, I made the decision to switch to Computer Science, which has worked out fantastically for me. I have just finished my first year as a CS major, and my third year of undergrad overall. Miraculously, I will still be obtaining my undergrad degree in CS in 4 years overall.  

Ever since I began undergrad, I have always known that as soon as I received my degree, I would be done with school and jump straight into the workforce. That is one of the things that drew me towards engineering. But now, after completing my Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course with an outstanding professor, I am considering pursuing a graduate degree, specifically an MS. The reason is that I have never enjoyed school or learning nearly as much as I do in my CS courses.  

One of my career goals has always been to progress to management positions. If I get my MS, do you think that I will be seen as an employee who is strictly technical? Would it be better to just begin working and gain experience?

I'm a academic of computer science and I'm looking for books related to any subject in computer science to read. 

It also could be related to innovation or things like that :)

* A table is in 1NF when non-atomic values are split into different rows (for example, two rows for one person doing two subjects)

* A table is in 2NF after this when you reduce data redundancy once you split the table into multiple tables. For example, having a table with the student ID and name, and then one with the student ID and course name. I'm sure this is wrong?

* 3NF is witchcraft.

I'm a 21 yo South Korean currently serving my (mandatory) duty in the military that lasts for 21 months (I've done 5 months so far). Before I entered, I finished 3 years of college, working towards a BS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics.

Here in the South Korean military, we are not allowed to use any electronic devices other than the limited computers that are available for use once a week for 90 minutes.

What kind of studying can I and should I be doing (without electronic devices) for me to be able to get back in school and finish up successfully and hopefully get employed?

Here's the problem: After my exam result is given, it is the only factor that decides which university and degree I can write on my preference list, and every degree of every university has it's own requirement for a base ranking of the student, so If i am ranked of around top 13000 students, I might be able to pursue mechanical engineering but not computer science in the same university. And I do really want to pursue computer engineering /science ( computer science is not a separate degree here), but do not want to study it in a low ranked university, and everybody around me also tells me to choose a better university over the degree I want and that winning the notion of being an engineer in a good technical university is the most important goal for an engineer. 

Back to my question, I was made aware of programs like MIT OCW when I visited this subreddit a couple months ago. However similar programs do not offer any sort of certificate. I know it gives me an invaluable ability in this age, but I am wondering if it is feasable and useful to learn it while also studying another engineering degree, and if there are international standard exams to documentate that I have learned computer science.

For a bit of a background on me, I love all things technology, I'm sort of a jack of all trades master of none. OK at most things amazing at nothing.

Ever since I was a kid I loved games and later in life (Middle school.) This transformed into my dream to program/develop games. I started where most do with Game Maker and the like and in high school I took game development and we used Torque and C# to program a game for a final project. I took a few web design courses and got certified in HTML/CSS as well as took courses for graphics, networking, and Visual BASIC.NET

However, that was 7 years ago. After high school I pretty much let all of these ""skills"" dull.. I didn't do anything with them aside from a few personal design works here and there for graphics or video. Nothing dealing in programming. I know can say I have an understanding of how it works but have no knowledge on what to do if you where to give me a problem to solve.

I would love to get back into it and now I'm looking to go back to school for computer science (I've learned that even though my dream is game design/development that it's not a very feasible plan to go to a game design school and CS opens up more opportunities.) I've taken a step back to re-evaluate my dream goals and I've found I'd be just happy with being a software developer, my problem is, I've always been embarrassingly terrible at math. To the point that I can't do multiplication without the help of a calculator in some cases (Depends on the equation..) I've always been told you need a strong math background to program and any and every computer science curriculum I've seen requires an insane amount of math. Oddly enough, when I was in high school doing these game projects in C# or using Visual BASIC I could code without needing much mathematical knowledge, if I had to do something I just made the computer do it for me (Not really sure how to explain this but I'm sure that I made the code go to it's elbow to get an answer just to get to it's knees so to speak..)

My end goal is to become a software developer as I've come to find that while I'm decent with graphics/video animation I'm not nor will I probably ever be good enough at it to make a career out of it.

Knowing what you now know about me (sorry for the rambling and jumping around..) would you say computer science is a plausible path for me to take? What hardships will I face? What kind of material should I look into before I got back to school?

Also, as a FYI I'm currently attempting to teach myself Java as I've heard it's the current language that is most used for business purposes but between my day to day life and work I haven't found much time to study enough to retain the information.

I appreciate any and all feedback you all can provide for me! Thanks!",2,0

The first intro java class I took was crazy easy because the professor dumbed it down for the class. However this semester I'm taking a intermediate java class and the transtiion has been fucking crazy. I barely knew arrays going into the class but she expects to already know how to write recursive methods.This is her first time teaching a lower division class after teaching upper division for a couple of years. Anyways I studied my ass off for the first two tests and completely bombed them but thank god I was able to do real well on the homework to keep me from getting a straight up F. However I did not pass the class as you need a C or higher  to move on. So now here I am questioning if this right for me. I love coding and learning it but this class took the fun right out of it. I'm going to retake this over the summer because I don't want to be a junior who is taking freshman level classes. So much embarrassment in that. Unfortunately the same professor is teaching it over the summer but I'm determined to get an A in the class no matter how tough. Is this a normal feeling? I know this major is right for me but isn't suppose to not make me feel so miserable?,5,2

I am trying to understand CPU interrupts for the purpose of understanding (and possibly training others) on crash dump analysis and Windows drivers in general.      

I have done some reading and studying, but I am not sure if my current understanding is accurate.       

The way I usually learn new things is to take my knowledge and draw illustrations until it becomes easy for other people to understand. After-all, if you can't teach it to someone else, you don't understand it.       

So my current task is to understand hardware interrupts, IRQ Levels, Spinlocks/Mutex, and spotting some of the various crashes/bugchecks that can occur.       

I have 2 illustrations I have come up with and I am trying to fix inaccuracies and hopefully better my understanding.        

For this I created a little guy that lives in your CPU named ""NT Scheduler"" who checks the different threads for stuff that needs to be processed.

From what I've gathered, if I want my little Web Server, I either have to register it's domain with someone like GoDaddy, or host my own DNS server. Two actually, as it seems the WHOIS databases require two IPs for a DNS server, one primary and one backup if that fails. 

Ok, fine. But what I haven't found an answer to yet, is how do the WHOIS databases acquire your DNS servers' IP addresses? Is it just part of the process of setting up your DNS server that the databases are contacted and updated? And then I suppose the main DNS servers update themselves? 

I know the main DNS servers have a hierarchical structure, so probably only a couple get updated.

Am I understanding this correctly? Just how is it that the WHOIS databases and main DNS servers get updated with the address of my little Web Server?

Silicon valley is arguably the best place to be in right now. I reside in India and find very few like-minded peers here.

I'm originally a biomedical engineer, but I work mostly in image analysis of microscopy images for my PhD. Of course in this line of work I have to keep a lab notebook but I'm having trouble with my programming part. For the wet work I perform it's easy to plan experiments and document their results or the used protocol independent whether the experiment fails or works out. 
But once I got my images I move to my computer and develop the program I need for whatever I want to assay it gets complicated. In this rather long process what actually goes into the notebook? All my failed attempts at getting to a meaningful segmentation or just the one that worked? All my futile or just not fast enough implementations of data structures or computations or just the one I chose finally? Right now I basically only create a notebook entry for code I also committed to my git repository and no intermediate steps. But that means sometimes my notebook seems very empty compared to the work I've done.
Anybody got experience with that? 
My general template for wet work looks like this:
Experiment Title:
Date:
Objective/Hypothesis/Introduction:
Materials and Methods:
Procedures and Protocols:
Results:
Discussion/Notes/Reflection/Outlook:

What would be a good template for coding?

The reason for this is due to the formatting of locants and multiplicative prefixes. Some examples IUPAC chemical names are as follows:

- [methane](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/methane.png)
- [2-methylbutane](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/2-methylbutane.png)
- [2-(1-nitrobutyl)pyridine](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/2-\(1-nitrobutyl\)pyridine.png)

- [2-oxopyrid-3-oic acid](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/2-oxopyrid-3-oic%20acid.png)
- [1,1,1-triformylpentan-5-amide](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/1%2C1%2C1-triformylpentan-5-amide.png)
- [2,2-dibromoundecan-1,4-dial](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/2%2C2-dibromoundecan-1%2C4-dial.png)

The general format is as follows:

    arabic-numeral = ""0"" | ""1"" | ""2"" | ""3"" | ""4"" | ""5"" | ""6"" | ""7"" | ""8"" | ""9"";
    nonzero-arabic-numeral = ""0"" | ""1"" | ""2"" | ""3"" | ""4"" | ""5"" | ""6"" | ""7"" | ""8"" | ""9"";

    locant = nonzero arabic numeral, { arabic numeral }, { ""'"" }, [ miniscule latin character ] | ""N"";
    locant prefix = locant, { "","",  locant }, ""-"";

    chemical = [ locant prefix ], [ multiplicative prefix ], { functional prefix, [ ""-"", locant prefix ], [ multiplicative prefix ] }, functional suffix;

The above grammar is by no means anywhere close to complete (and is actually incorrect in many regards for sake of simplicity). Additionally, it assumes that the grammar is a context-free grammar, which is not the case. As you might be able to gather, the number of locants provided needs to match the following multiplicative prefix. Additionally, the numbers in each locant must be in a specific order.

Having not taken a formal languages class yet, I'm not sure what kind of language this is or more importantly what kind of grammar and abstract machine would be needed.",1,8

CS undergrad here currently going to a community college in Arizona. Transferring to ASU next spring.


For the fall semester I'll be lab teching for my current teacher, but I'm looking for a way to earn money afterwards, since I'll be switching schools. I'm currently a gymnastics coach and I'll always be able to fall back on that if need be, but a paid part-time internship during the semester would be way preferable.


My question is, where can I look for school year internships? I've tried googling it, but I end up with super generic sites that don't help. I've heard to find places that I would like to intern at and give them a call, but I have no idea what exists in my area, or where to begin.",1,0

I have some ideas but I'd like to hear from others before implementing what some third year developer thinks.     
    
About us: We're mostly a Python shop, but have some other languages within our stack. Web development mainly, with some aggregation scripts -- API's sitting out in the wild for our customers to consume, with a few front end app's that integrate a whole mess of them.     
    
1. **Releasing/Rollbacks**: Currently using fabric to release and roll back most of our apps. This gets a bit confusing with the new guys to set up between the combination of fabfile, build files, and spec files. There's lots of news about Docker these days, but I'm not sure that's right for us. I've considered playing around with Github hooks to do a majority of deployment if necessary.    
     
2. **Development in isolation**: Development requires a steady VPN connection, which is a major pain point considering we've recently lost our infrastructure guy. We already have a Vagrant image set up for our Golang environment, but it leaves a bit to be desired. How would you go about grabbing data from live databases for testing in these isolated environments? Are there options aside from Vagrant?    
     
3. **Testing in a microservice environment**: Some of our microservices require others in order to generate a proper result. I've thus far been unable to come up with a way of testing the whole cluster of apps. Perhaps this goes hand in hand with #2.     
     
4. **Monitoring**: Currently being done VIA ignored email alarms. We've recently set up Logstash and Kabana for one of our more critical applications, which has been helpful to isolate some issues that we've been tracking. Definitely a step in the right direction. Looking for some additional options to help keep track of our apps.    
     
5. **Documentation**: Documenting our API's is something that we're fairly capable of keeping up with, though we have issues trying to describe our application stack, and onboarding new people due to the complication nature of what we do. Detailed descriptions of what a service does, hasn't seemed to help much.

Sci courses provide enough foundation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/37fil3/do_comp_sci_courses_provide_enough_foundation/,Dryeck,1432708645,"I'm going to be a sophomore CS major next semester, and so far I've loved both of the programming courses I've taken (one in Scheme, one in Java) and done well in each of them.  So, I think I'm lucky enough to have found a major that I enjoy doing.  

When I talk to other CS majors, they run the gambit from struggling to pass their classes to being incredibly smart and doing things that I don't have a clue about.  I've tried to teach myself CS topics outside of class every now and then, but I always get really intimidated because it's such a huge subject and I can barely understand any of it.

I want to chalk this up to only having done one year in college, but then I see other people who are doing things that I feel like I should know, so that makes me think that I'm falling behind.

So I guess my question is, is following a (fairly rigorous at my school) CS curriculum going to be enough to teach me what I need to know? Or is a lot of outside learning the only way I'm going to do as well as I want to do for myself?

TL;DR I think I love computer science but get anxious and intimidated when I see how much information is out there and confused about what I need to know.",6,8

I took Game Dev because it was an area of programming that I was particularly interested in at the time and wanted to learn more about other areas of it as well. While my interest in the games industry hasn't changed, my hopefulness at actually being able to get into the industry and enjoy it (whether that be at a medium-large company, a start-up or the unlikely possibility that I  can do something myself) has dropped dramatically, mainly due to this subreddit and other's opinions on the games industry. I thought this was what I wanted to do and focus on, but I'm not too sure now.

The other alternative, that I can see at least, is for me to pursue my other interest within CompSci and focus more on Artificial Intelligence (in general and maybe in games)  or just stick to general software development and see what I can do. I've not done much when it comes to AI and software development as of yet, whereas I've made a few basic games (including an FPS) which I've enjoyed. 

I know there are a lot of posts on here similar to this one, believe me I've read a large portion of them, but none of them have really made it clear or stood out to me by making me think ""Yeah, this has helped my decision. I know what I want to do now.""

I also like entering sites like new egg and trying to build a pc for a defined purpose(Saving power, Most efficent and etc.).
Based on what i said above what field of computer science you think suits me the best?

I've recently discovered the amazing, broad field of Computer Science Engineering and am very motivated to find out more, but I'm not sure how to proceed.  


Here are my dilemmas:

* Already having a degree means that top universities won't admit me because they're ""committed to students pursuing their first undergraduate degree.""  This seems like a deal-breaker, but I can't imagine that's actually the case.  

* I lack most of the prereqs to get into a CSE program, let alone to stand out within a pool of ""highly qualified applicants.""  I'm more than willing to take calculus, differential equations, advanced physics, and intro computer science courses, but I don't know which means of doing so are deemed worthwhile and which aren't.  

* I'm not as young as I once was and time is of the essence.  My wife and I don't have kids yet and we'd like to have our careers underway before we start having them.  

My questions: 

* Does anyone have experience with post-baccalaureate enrolment in a major university?  What are the odds of getting my foot in the door with an established company if I have a degree from a school no one's ever heard of?

* What's the best way to go about getting those prereqs in a way that will improve my odds of getting accepted into a selective CSE program?  Are online courses taken seriously?  Community college courses?  What about individuals who are self-taught? 

* I'm not one for quick fixes, but is there anyway to expedite the process of going from student to employee?  Is a 4 year degree an absolute necessity in this field, or are there fast-track options?  

I know that's a lot, so thank you for whatever insights you can offer.  I want to work with top notch people, find meaningful solutions to real world problems, and improve quality of life through computer science.  Please help me to do what you do!
