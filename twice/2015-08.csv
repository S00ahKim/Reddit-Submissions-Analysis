So I was waiting for artists outside JYPE center in Seoul. Like 5 minutes after I got there, all of TWICE suddenly walked out. I really wanted to do something, anything, ask for a picture. I just couldn't. I choked and stood still by the Dunkin Donuts. I promised myself to go ask next time. 

A while later Jungyeon comes by with a staff member - I was still frozen. Then she went by a third time. Still frozen. 

I've been regretting this all day. And I just want to tell anyone who gets to see them to remember that you might not have a second chance. Something something TWICE.
