4,2019-1-1,2019,1,1,13,abf49v,TWICE's 2018 By the Numbers Part 1,Gordra15,1546318627,"Firstly, I am marking this as ""Part 1"" due to GAON and ORICON chart releases. I want to do their sales numbers, but those have not been released yet. I'll also include award shows, music shows, and some other tidbits in that post. This post is going to focus on the more digital side; digital sales, YouTube views, accomplishments, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, this data is simply stating what is provided by the official companies, and is not being used to show that TWICE is better or worse than other groups; more so, where they stand and how they are impacting the market. Be proud of them and all other groups for the achievements they get and support any and all groups you follow. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto the data. First up;

**GAON Digital Index**

In 2018, TWICE topped the Digital Index chart for all girl groups, 3rd for K-Pop groups, and 5th for all artists, with 2,009,581,853 ""units"" accumulated through 7 songs. 

Yes or Yes received a Perfect All-Kill, which was their only one in 2018. They've received 4 all-time (Cheer Up &amp; TT in 2016, Knock Knock in 2017). This makes TWICE the only K-Pop group **ever** to receive a PAK in 3 consecutive years. With 4 PAKs, they are the 3rd overall in most PAKs achieved (BigBang has 5, IU has 12). 

Yes or Yes tied for the fastest Certified All-Kill of the year at 2 hours. 

What is Love? charted on the MelOn top 10 for 9 weeks. Dance the Night Away for 10 weeks. Yes or Yes is still on the chart, and has been since release (7 weeks and counting). Heart Shaker also charted in the top 10 for the first 3 weeks of 2018, as well as the last 3 weeks on 2017. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YouTube (All of the viewing numbers are written as of \~11:30PM Eastern Standard Time)**

As of year-end 2018, TWICE has 1 song in the Top 10 most viewed K-Pop music videos (TT, #9, 426.4M views). Fun fact; PSY is still and likely will for a long, LONG time have the top 2 positions with Gangnam Style and Gentleman. He also has the 3rd spot, but that will fall much sooner.

Along with TT, they have 4 other songs in the top 30. Likey (#17, 339.3M views), Cheer Up (#22, 310.2M views), Like Ooh-Ahh (#26, 277.3M views), and Heart Shaker (#30, 238.9M views). As of typing this, What is Love? is #31 at 238M views, less than 1 million behind Heart Shaker. 

Views of Korean songs released in 2018:

What is Love? - 238M 

Dance the Night Away - 143.3M

Yes or Yes - 114.6M 

The Best Thing I Ever Did - 21.3M

Total - 516.2M

Achievements: TWICE's Yes or Yes was the fastest girl group video to reach 10M (6 hours and 2 minutes), 20M (10 hours and 27 minutes), and reached 31.4M views in the first 24 hours, the most ever by a girl group. It reached 100M views 39 days after release; the only TWICE song to do this faster was Likey, which achieved the milestone in 34 days. 

This also means all main title tracks are above 100M views (Like Ooh Ahh, Cheer Up, TT, Knock Knock, Signal, Likey, Heart Shaker, What is Love?, Dance the Night Away, and Yes or Yes). 

The Best Thing I Ever Did has reached 21.3M views in just 19 days. While a bit slow compared to their main title tracks, compare this to Merry &amp; Happy (last years winter carol release), which is barely cresting 27M views. From that perspective, TBIED is a very impressive view count. These two ""title tracks"" are the only ones NOT over 100M views. 

Views of Japanese songs released in 2018:

Candy Pop - 92M

Wake Me Up - 35.8M

BDZ - 29.6M

Brand New Girl - 23.6M

Stay By My Side - 5.3M

Total: 186.3M

Achievements: Of active groups, TWICE has the most Japanese music video views (overall, so this is including JPN versions of Korean title tracks). They also have the most for 2018 groups (and 4 of the top 5). The most viewed Japanese music video from a K-Pop group is actually not a music video, but a dance video, of Girls' Generation's Mr. Taxi. The actual music video has only 26M views, but the dance video is at 138.5M. The next closest is Candy Pop. (Fun tidbit as well; while Candy Pop is dominating the YouTube views, Wake Me Up is the better selling single in Japan).

Let me know if there's anything I may have missed, gotten wrong, or if you misunderstand something and I will explain. Again, this is part 1 of likely 2 parts (maybe 3; I may dedicate part 2 specifically to sales and awards, and then have a part 3 be miscellaneous. But... maybe not). If there is anything you'd like me to look at, leave a comment and I'll snatch all that data for you. ",6,1

65,2019-1-2,2019,1,2,22,abt8j4,Potential r/twice Discord channel,Gordra15,1546434374,"Hey guys. Last week, on the mega survey post, there were some passing comments about creating a r/twice Discord after seeing most people say they play games in their free time. 

I'm using this post to gauge how many people would actually* be interested and use it. I came up with some basic rules, but ultimately there will be some changes before anything is made.

*For those not familiar with discord, it's a large talk/text app designed for larger groups so we can all game together. Kind of like a party chat system, but a bit more detailed and useful.

Rules/Guidelines
1. While it is a twice subreddit discord, you don't have to post/talk only about twice. There is an option for discord to have multiple channels for talk/text. There will likely be one specifically for talk about twice and their content, one for kpop in general, and one or two of just general talk about the random things throughout your day. 

2. Any subreddit rules in regards to behavior toward each other and the members of twice still apply. No posting or talking about the members in an overly sexual/inappropriate way, be nice to each other, etc.

3. Discord is a talk/text app for gaming. It is implied, *but not required*, for you to be an active gamer to participate. 

4. All members of the Discord must be part of the twice subreddit (i.e. friends will not be allowed in, all members must be approved by a mod of the discord).

5. The mods of the Discord server and the mods of the subreddit are NOT the same. If there is a problem in Discord, go to one of those mods, and vice versa. 


Let me know if any of these rules need change or if you have other ideas. Also, I am fine with creating and running this discord but I would like some confirmation people will take part, and would like a few people to help me moderate it as well. Send me a message if that sounds like something you'd like to do.",13,1

April: Japan Comeback. 

&amp;#x200B;

July: Korean comeback with a summer/chill vibe like DTNA. 

&amp;#x200B;

September: The start of unit promotions? I would love for them to have some smaller group work as well to highlight each member's skills, cause tbh, Chaeyoung and other members are barely getting any lines and I barely hear their voices. 

&amp;#x200B;

November: Another Korean comeback that charts well and ends the year in a bang, winning multiple music shows and appearing on year-end shows.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's gonna be another busy year for them, but not as much stuff going on as 2018. They've already established themselves as one of the best girl groups in history, and i think they'll go more for a mature style (cause JYP is apparently debuting a new GG) and will also work to establish each member's skills and popularity.

Part 3 will focus strictly on sales, award shows, and music shows. This part will be just some miscellaneous stuff, mostly focused on reddit posts and vlives. I will only be looking at posts in 2018, and year-end values as of yesterday (January 1st, 2019). 

Let's start with (sub)reddit posts:

r/twice**:** 

In our subreddit, the most upvoted post was the release of ""What is Love?"" with 2.1k upvotes and 315 comments. 

The most upvoted GIF was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/a65une/twice_have_won_a_daesang_for_each_year_jihyo_was/) post of Jihyo crying after winning their 10th Daesang, tying for the most in girl group K-Pop history. This was won with Song of the Year ""What is Love?"" at MAMA Japan 2018. 

The most upvoted image was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/8kum9x/spent_half_of_her_life_as_a_trainee_not_knowing/) post of Jihyo crying after TWICELAND 2 this past summer. She said a long speech of how scared she was that she would never debut, that they wouldn't be successful, etc. and thanking the fans for their support and love. It was very emotional and I recommend everyone go watch it if you haven't.

In posts with over 1k upvotes (that are not music videos), here are the girls who appear. There is some overlap, as multiple girls may appear in one post:

4: Jeongyeon (One is a fan drawing)

3: Jihyo, Mina

2: Momo, Sana, TWICE

1: Tzuyu, Dahyun, Nayeon. 

Poor Chaebae is the only one not in a post over 1k upvotes unless it's a group photo. You'll get 'em next year Chae. She's gonna drop a hard rap and everyone will cry. 

r/kpop**:**

""What is Love?"" is also the most upvoted post on the main K-Pop subreddit, and 3rd of all time. The only posts above it are TWICE's own Likey M/V release, and the very unfortunate and shocking news of SHINee's Jonghyun's passing.

Yes or Yes and Dance the Night Away break the top 15, at #7 and #15 respectively. Yes or Yes has 5 Reddit platinums and 7 golds; the most of any other K-Pop video on the subreddit. 

Our own /u/zetsupetsu reached the #8 spot of the year with [this post about TWICE](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/88msng/is_twice_now_considered_higher_than_snsd_within/) and how they are higher than SNSD. It's a bit of a shitpost, where he compares their heights (not their sales, views, etc.) to prove that TWICE is, in fact, higher (taller) than SNSD. It's one of my favorite K-Pop posts ever.

**Individual subreddits:**

r/NoSanaNoLife: 4.8k &gt; r/tzuyu: 4.3k &gt; r/MyouiMina: 3.2k &gt; r/momo: 3.0k &gt; r/dahyun: 2.8k &gt; r/nayeon: 2.3k &gt; r/chaeyoung: 1.9k &gt; r/Jeongyeon: 1.9k &gt; r/ParkJihyo: 1.8k

&amp;#x200B;

**VLIVE:**

As of year-end 2018, TWICE is the 6th most followed VLive channel and 2nd among girl groups with 4,437,357 followers. The 7th channel is closely behind at 4.2M, and then there's a large gap where #8 drops to 3.2M. In 2018, they posted 322 vlive videos. This includes anything posted to their channel; TWICE TV, offficial content, dance videos, ""selfie videos"" that the girls do in their free time, etc.

TWICE has more followers from Japan than they do from Korea, according to VLive. Japan is first, then South Korea, then the Philippines. Their total numbers look like this:  Followers: 4,437,421, Videos: 1,067, Plays: 334,399,453, Likes: 12,447,992,955, Comments: 65,085,785.

Admittedly, I did not count for every single video (I'm sorry), but at a glance, it seems that Momo, Sana, and Nayeon host/appear in the most self-recorded videos. Here are the top 5 videos on their VLive that were posted in 2018 (based on ""Likes"")

\#1: [Tzuyu solo-cam](https://www.vlive.tv/video/56490?channelCode=EDBF) with 260M likes. This 19-minute video is, by far, the shortest video on this list, and by far the most liked. 

\#2: [Top 10 Global VLive](https://www.vlive.tv/video/57662?channelCode=EDBF) with 239M likes. This was the video done at the beginning of 2018 for TWICE being voted in the Top 10 VLive channels. This voting was just completed for this year, and we will be receiving another one of these videos in 2019. 

\#3: [Dahyun playing piano](https://www.vlive.tv/video/62489?channelCode=EDBF) with 121M likes. A considerable drop, but still an impressive amount. This almost 2-hour video is Dahyun just by herself playing piano for about half of it and acting like the adorable goof she is for the other half.

\#4: [Chaeyoung's Strawberry Farm ft. Tzuyu](https://www.vlive.tv/video/70873?channelCode=EDBF) with 117M likes. This 1.5 hour video is, as it says. It's Chaeyoung showing off her gardening skills (indoors) and Tzuyu comes in to help/learn. 

\#5: [Jihyo's Candy Night ft. Momo, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon](https://www.vlive.tv/video/70401?channelCode=EDBF) with 112M likes. This 1.5 video features Jihyo cooking with Momo, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon. You may (in)famously know part of this video, where Momo describes her trouble during trainee years where she had to lose 7kg in a week so she ate only ice cubes. 

The ""What is Love?"" tutorial dance practice ft. Sana was the most liked of Momo's tutorial dances, but ""Dance the Night Away"" was the most liked group dance practice.

105,2019-1-3,2019,1,3,22,ac5wl0,Which Twice member do you think is the most funniest in variety shows?,lcwchewy,1546523633,"To be honest, it seems to me that many Twice members are still too shy to be funny, and Twice weren't really picked for their variety skills, except for arguably Dahyun. They're super attractive, and I have a good time whenever I watch them in variety shows.

Among the nine members, the two that I feel could be really funny are Jeongyeon, and Tzuyu.

Here is my perception of Twice's personality.

Nayeon: can act really cute, aegyo super on point on recent variety show (crazy cute). Potentially can be really funny, but is the unnie, so younger members rarely really tease her. Makes jokes about others, sharing the spotlight.  

Jeongyeon: has a real bubbly vibe, has fun with everyone, most members can make fun of her. She seems to come up with the funniest things, but sometimes is probably too shy or is maybe warned to contain herself. 

Momo: really cute personality, seems to have fun with everyone as well, but just sometimes a little too slow. funny for being very clumsy than being witty. 

Sana: really cute as well, famous for being super cute and melts me everytime with her eyes. clumsy cute, sort of like Momo. 

Jihyo: being the leader, she probably is stressed and holds more responsibility than other members, does everything that's asked of her well, while trying hard to maintain order in Twice.

Mina: really beautiful smile, but very, very quiet. Whenever she does something and its not edited out I'm alway super excited for it and watch whatever it is on loop.

Dahyun: The least shy out of the nine and that's why she's ""in charge of variety,"" and I think she's sort of burdened by it. When it's time for her to work, she comes out to ENTERTAIN, but sort of a planned comedy, not very natural funny.

Chaeyoung: cute, actually super cute. Maybe because of her size and age, she seems cute no matter what she does. sometimes funny, so not exactly no jam.

Tzuyu: very shy, but when she decides to talk it's really funny, sometimes a little too slow as well but recovers it with her very blunt personality, so blunt its funny.

116,2019-1-4,2019,1,4,3,ac8lx4,Views on TWICEs concept. Does it need to chance to introduce some other members some more screen time? Or if it works dont change it?,xINASN3xSTEVE,1546540551,"So, where do I start. I might get a lot of hate for this discussion. but I hope I dont. 

After watching the KBS special stage that was put together by all the JYP artists, I started to think maybe TWICE could change up their concept? (Please remember I do not speak for all and this is my own views which I hope we can have a civil discussion on.) 

Point 1: When the rap line of JYP started after Dowoons drum solo (amazing btw) Baby Tiger Chae came out to a hard beat and spit some fire. I feel she is one of the most under appreciated in the groups title tracks. I know from listening to B-Sides she has more of a role, be it writing a song or having some producing imput. But in title tracks I feel where most of TWICEs songs arent really including a rap as of late, should this be a way to change up the concept and include her (and possibly dubu or momo) in a rap segment like What is Love?. In no way do I think Chae is untalented but I think when it comes to singing she can be shy and holds it back. I have thought about where is the Chae of Sixteen gone? The one they all feard LOL!

Point 2: The dance segement Jeongyeon, Nayeon, Jihyo, Sana and Mina took part in with the boys from Stray Kids (Stray Kids are heading towards big things btw.) I get that their dance was a little different from The boys dance but they still showed a hard hitting girl crush style when performing it! I think they all in the group of TWICE can do a fiercer concept its just them having the mentality of doing it!

Point 3: Tzuyu performing Hush. I dont think I need to say much for many to agree that she killed it! Just another point as to them being a versatile group!

This post I hope doesnt annoy people! Just my views and points on where TWICE and JYP could look at changing their concept! I font want them too just yet but looking at their performances on KBS. They could do it. But for me if it works then stick to it! Twice are the face of colour pop and I will always stan them as this group got me into KPop!

Thanks for the read! If you made it this far! Have a great day and feel free to tell me what you disagree with in the comments! :)",0,1

I'm looking at my notes and I think that putting all of this as well as their sales is going to be **way** too long, so I'm breaking them up. Part 4, which will look at sales and album achievements, will come out likely Sunday/Monday (which is when the year-end charts will be released, I hope). 

There is also some other information that was released toward regarding YouTube videos/streaming (which was in part 1) that I'm going to quickly add here. 

TT charted on Japan's Hot 100 for 108 weeks. It just fell out of the 100 in November. This is the longest by any K-Pop group by 30 weeks, and is the highest of any foreign artist (Pharrell Williams' Happy charted for 104 weeks). There are only **FOUR** Japanese artists to have even achieved this. The record is set by One OK Rock at 144 weeks. Even more impressive, it wasn't even the Japanese version of TT.

Japan streamed the most TWICE videos out of any country in the world - by alot. At 602M views, the next highest is South Korea at 311M views. The difference between #1 and #2 is the same as the difference between #2 and #17 (Turkey). [You can look at the top 20 here.](https://twitter.com/twicestats/status/1080750624562589696) Similarly, at 602M, TWICE is the 2nd of **ALL** artists in Japan for YouTube views in 2018. #1 is Kenshi Yonezu, arguably the most famous singer/songwriter in Japan right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

ONTO THE AWARDS

I'll start with music shows. These stats are gathered from all of their 2018 Music Show performances. For those who just like to watch and don't fully understand what or how music shows work; groups will go on and perform their newest songs on stage and allow fans and/or judges to vote and score them, and then a winner is chosen. Usually this is done for a month or two, but there are some exceptions to shorter/longer promotions, and also dependent on the success (songs that get more wins will usually appear more). TWICE had 4 possible to win in 2018; Heart Shaker, What is Love?, Dance the Night Away, and Yes or Yes. \*Note: Heart Shaker was released late in 2017, but their promotion for it lasted into January of 2018.

**Music Show Wins**

TWICE won 28 music show awards in 2018. They won 35 in 2017 and 24 in 2016. This puts them at 87 wins overall, tying them for 3rd for all K-Pop groups and 2nd for girl groups. Their 35 wins in 2017 is the most won in a single year by any K-Pop group. 

\#2 (Girls' Generation) has 100 wins and #1 (EXO) has 108 wins. TWICE has won (atleast) 24 each year, and has an average of 9.6 wins (rounded down to 9) per song. Assuming they release 3 songs and reach their average wins, they'll push up to that #1 spot, assuming EXO does not win any (which will really depend on how many comebacks they have). 

In 2018, they had Heart Shaker win 2 shows (plus 7 from 2017, for a total of 9). What is Love? at 12 tied Signal for #2 in most wins, behind TT's 13. Dance the Night Away won 10, and Yes or Yes won their lowest amount at only 4\*. This is likely due to the stacked November comebacks they went up against. \*Of songs that have won; Like Ooh-Ahh never won at a music show. Cheer Up was their first song to receive a victory.

Note: TWICE has achieved their 87 wins with 9 songs (Cheer Up, TT, Knock Knock, Signal, Likey, Heart Shaker, What is Love?, Dance the Night Away, and Yes or Yes). #1, #2, and the other half of the #3 tie all had 13, 14, and 14 songs respectively. (Again, assuming average wins, they will reach #1 with 12 songs).

**Music Show Achievements**

As of this year, with 2 Triple Crown wins (What is Love? and Dance the Night Away) TWICE is the first K-Pop group to win 8 consecutive Inkigayo Triple Crowns. This means that, for 3 consecutive weeks, the song they were promoting won at Inkigayo. Of the 9 songs listed above, every song won a Triple Crown except for Yes or Yes, from Cheer Up to Dance the Night Away. The importance of this is that once a song wins a Triple Crown, it is deemed ""graduated"" and will no longer appear on Inkigayo, it's a very nice achievement. This means they've received 25 wins at Inkigayo, their highest out of the music shows, 7 of which came in 2018. They've also won 23 times at Music Bank, though only 4 of those wins came in 2018 (TT only won 6, Cheer Up 5).

While it only won 4 music shows, Yes or Yes received more wins (2) than Dance the Night Away at MBC Show Champion (1), and tied with 1 win at MCountdown. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AWARDS**

I'll go over TWICE awards in 2018 and then what their numbers look like overall. For those unaware; a Daesang is considered the ""Grand award"" and is the highest prize a group can win in that category at an awards show. This will be important later. 

Starting off; there are still 3 more awards shows in early 2019 that will give awards to albums, songs, and groups from 2018, these will technically count for awards won in 2019 even though they are in regards to 2018 songs; I will not count these. TWICE has overall 10 nominations between the 3, and I'm predicting they'll win 3 or 4 of those 10. Similarly, some awards won in 2018 are actually from 2017 releases like Knock Knock, Heart Shaker, and their album TWICEtagram (among others).

Onto the achievements;

**KOREAN AWARDS**

TWICE won 4 Daesangs in 2018:

**Daesang**\- Song of the Year (Korea Popular Music Awards 2018)

**Daesang**\- Song of the Year (MAMA Awards 2018)

**Daesang**\- Best Selling Artist of the Year (MBC Plus X Genie Music Awards 2018)

**Daesang**\- Digital Daesang (Soribada Awards 2018)

They also won 18 other awards in the year of 2018. You can find the full list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Twice) if you'd like to see. Most of their Korean awards come in terms of achievements, which I will explain below with their combined Japanese awards.

**JAPANESE AWARDS**

Clearly, TWICE was pretty successful in Japan this year. As taken from above, they were the second most viewed artist on YouTube and Japan contributed almost double the amount of views that TWICE's own country of South Korea did. In 2017, TWICE made their official debut in Japan. The Japan Gold Disc Awards are held in the beginning of January so all awards below were released in 2017. In 2018, TWICE received eight nominations from 3 different shows and **won six of those eight**. They won all 5 awards of their 5 nominations at Japan Gold Disc Awards;

New Artist of the Year (Asia) - TWICE

Best 3 New Artist (Asia) - TWICE 

Album of the Year (Asia) - *#TWICE*

Best 3 Albums (Asia) - *#TWICE*

Song of the Year by Download (Asia) - TT (Jpn. Version)

Also, ""Wake Me Up"" won Best Song at Japan Record.

**AWARD ACHIEVEMENTS**

Their 4 Daesang wins this year give them 11 total (5 in 2017, 2 in 2016). 11 is the most earned by any K-Pop girl group, and 2nd by ANY K-Pop group. EXO comfortably sits at #1 with 21.

While most of their awards are as a group (awarded to TWICE); ""What is Love?"" (the song) with 2 awards ties with Signal and Heart Shaker for the 2nd most awarded TWICE song. Cheer Up holds the #1 spot with 4. 

Overall, TWICE has received 147 nominations, and have won a total of 60. With their Japanese awards included, TWICE won a total of 28 awards this year. In all three years combined since their debut, they won 20. They've also won 12 other awards that were not from award shows themselves, but still count all the same (like VLive, Cable TV, Simply K-Pop, etc.), only 1 of which came in 2018. They have also technically already won 2 VLive awards for 2019, which is counted in this total. This places them 3rd overall for girl groups; behind Girls' Generation (121) and 2NE1 (62). 

Their wins in 2018 being so much higher is largely in part to three contributing factors; 6 wins in Japan vs 0 from other years, and also 3 wins from MBC Awards and 2 wins from Korea Popular Music (both of which did not exist prior to 2018). Even so, take away those 11 wins and they've still won 17 which is the most of any year. 

**Also to note: Japan Gold Disc awards are held in early January and I did not include any nominations TWICE may have in the 3 awards shows coming up that I had listed above. TWICE will be present both days but I have not been able to find a source of any nominations they may have. I expect them to do well at these awards, considering the success of BDZ, Candy Pop, and Wake Me Up. However, I'm unaware of all the categories so they may not properly fit.** 

Overall, I predict that the early award shows in 2019 (1 in Japan, 3 in Korea) will amount to... 6 more wins for TWICE. 3 in Korea and 3 in Japan. Let's see how I do when they happen.

&amp;#x200B;

That does it for this part. Part 4 to come Sunday or Monday. There are some good sources out there already with reliable numbers for the first 11 months of 2018 in regards to TWICE sales, but I want to make sure I include **everything** so I'm going to wait. Let me know any predictions you have regarding TWICE awards, wins, and other stuff for the coming year. Let me know if I missed anything relevant or got some information wrong (there's lots going around so I may have made a typo or miscounted). 

I've received a couple comments and messages regarding this data and what I use and my sources. I'll answer that here (feel free to skip if you don't care). I compile all of this data by myself in my free time, using my own eyes and hands. I don't have a data parser or anything like that, which is why there are bound to be some mistakes. All of my data information is gathered from twitter, onehallyu, allkpop, wikipedia, and official GAON/ORICON/etc. websites. In the event data numbers clash between two sources, I'll use my best judgment to decide which one is more reliable. ",9,1

I wanted to watch Sixteen by JYP, to see how the members of Twice got to where they're right now.
But I struggle to find good sites that provide good subs.

I have used sites like Kshow123, but on some of the episodes, the subs are so poorly made, that I don't want to continue watching it. 

So I basically googled the episode and found this one. And I gotta say im pretty amazed by the quality of the subs.

I'll split them up by individual members, then the group as a whole, and then have some at the end for pairings.

212,2019-1-6,2019,1,6,10,ad0y53,Popularity Ranking of Members Based on /r/twice and /r/twicemedia Upvotes.,GodspeedMe,1546739149,"I recently discovered that /r/twice and /r/twicemedia encourage posts to have real member names in the title. This makes it easy to scrape both subreddits. So, I thought it would be cool to see which members are the most popular based on their total number of votes. 

I wrote a Python script to get all the posts ever submitted to /r/twice and /r/twicemedia. If a submission title contained the name of exactly one Twice member I would add the submission's score (upvotes - downvotes) to the member's individual score. Submission titles with multiple names were not considered towards this score.

&amp;nbsp;

|           | Total Score | Total Posts | Average Votes |

| jeongyeon | 200438      | 1651        | 121.403998    |

&amp;nbsp;

I was also curious to see which members were the most popular across each era. I decided to divide the scores by eras and create a separate Twice ranking for each era. An era starts at the release date of a single and ends at the release date of the next single. I only counted singles that had more than 100m views on Youtube.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I wanted to see which pair of members was the most popular. For each pair of members, I counted the number of times their names appear in the same title. I didn't count post titles that had 3 or more names.

[Pair Heat Map](https://i.imgur.com/g3gemhL.png)

&amp;nbsp;

The top 3 pairs are Sana - Dahyun (316), then Momo - Sana (274), then Momo - Nayeon (221). The bottom 3 are Jeongyeon - Dahyun (44), then Jihyo - Chaeyoung (30), and at the very bottom Jihyo - Dahyun (15).

To clarify, I'm not trying to rank them and say which member is the best. I'm just presenting data. It's just an interesting way to see how the subreddits behave. Of course there's no objective way to rank each member.

345,2019-1-8,2019,1,8,23,aduhr6,Where would you like to see the members after the group inevitably ends?,Gordra15,1546956372,"Whether it's in 3 years at the end of their contract, or they all renew and continue for several more; TWICE will inevitably end. That being said, that doesn't (necessarily) mean the end of their careers.

What would you like to see the members do? Acting, hosting, solo careers, maybe a small sub-unit career? Would you still follow them individually, or would your attention to their lives fade out?

Here's where I think each member would shine; though obviously it's not set in stone and may not happen at all or anytime soon. I'd like to see all of them take a nice break too, get some time to relax and see family. 

I think Nayeon and Jihyo would both do well in a solo career. Though she trained for a long time and might get burnt out of performing, it seems like Jihyo really likes to be on stage and make people happy and perform for everyone. Nayeon is similar, she loves the rush of it. 

Jeongyeon's sister is an actress and this could either make her more or less likely to act, but I think she would do well. 

Momo is a dancer. That's what she has always done, she clearly loves it, and she's goddamn good at it. WHERE she dances I'm sure will vary, but I would like to see her stay in the relative field of K-Pop or in Japan. I think she'd make a great dance teacher/choreographer, whether hired by groups or sticking to a particular show. 

Sana and Dahyun I think would both do some form of variety/hosting. Dahyun clearly has a knack for it, and has experience hosting shows and ceremonies. I think Sana would likely return to Japan, but still would continue with something like this. 

Mina and Tzuyu are tricky; they're both great dancers and great singers, but they're a bit more shy and reserved so I don't know if they would want to do a solo career or hosting. Honestly I think both of them would likely ""retire"" from idol life. Especially being foreign to Korea, I think they'd move back home and enjoy time with their family. 

Chaeyoung could do anything and succeed, I think. She's not a super strong dancer, but she can sing and rap crazy well, which is where she would be able to shine. She can write lyrics, she plays instruments, she draws, she's funny. Chaeyoung is arguably the most talented, musically, of the group, and I would be surprised if she didn't utilize that going forward. 


As a note, I think all members will show some push toward a post-TWICE direction while still part of the group. I'm not sure what their contract details, but in the later years near the end of their contracts when they have less comebacks, I wouldn't be surprised to see maybe a sub-unit or some solo work. Also, I think all of them will always support each other and keep in touch, and I would expect a reunion tour at some time. ",3,1

Whether it's in 3 years at the end of their contract, or they all renew and continue for several more; TWICE will unfortunately have to come to an end. Idol life as a group is only sustainable for so long, considering the physical toll and also just sheer market saturation and consumerism. That being said, that doesn't (necessarily) mean the end of their careers.

Jeongyeon's sister is an actress and this could either make her more or less likely to act, but I think she would do well. I also think she has a very nice, soothing, powerful voice and could do good solos for things like OSTs.

Momo  is a dancer. That's what she has always done, she clearly loves it, and  she's goddamn good at it. WHERE she dances I'm sure will vary, but I  would like to see her stay in the relative field of K-Pop or in Japan.

504,2019-1-12,2019,1,12,14,af4h4j,Speculating about TWICE's NA Tour,Hellyeah44,1547271712,"TWICE's NA Tour has been all but confirmed. With that being said, I'd like to speculate about the prices and location of the tour. 

&amp;#x200B;

We can begin first with location. I think the most influential factors that will give us insight into predicting locations are 1) Company and 2) Population. TWICE is managed by JYP Entertainment, which also manages GOT7. GOT7 had a world tour not too long ago, and had 3 stops in NA; Toronto, LA, and Houston. It would not surprise me at all if TWICE used those exact same locations and maybe a few more. I predict that if TWICE do have more than 3 stops in NA, which is more than likely, then possible other areas could be New York, Ontario, Chicago, and Miami, due to the fact that these locations have already been used by other groups, and could prove less adverse than trying a new location.

&amp;#x200B;

Pricing is pretty hard to predict, though I will do my best. We can begin with special packages they might offer to interact with the artist. Red Velvet is currently touring, but I don't think they have any optional packages you can buy to interact with the artist. However, OH MY GIRL is also touring, but they offer a high touch event, a group picture, early access to the venue, a lanyard and laminate, as well as a signed poster by all the members. On top of all this, they are also giving away prizes to those who do decide to spend the $200 dollars this package costs. What concerns me is that Red Velvet is arguably a more popular group in the US than OMG, but they didn't use that opportunity to try for a cash grab. Additionally, GOT7, to my knowledge, did not offer this special premium package, so I think it is unlikely TWICE will have a package of this type. Though, if they do, I would expect it to be somewhere around 200-300 dollars, and provide similar perks to OMG's package. As far as venue tickets are concerned, it is almost a given that tickets will be extremely competitive. I don't predict TWICE will have more than 7 stops, and because of this, many ONCEs will try to attend at least one event. I predict that Tickets will range from the low 70s to 300 dollars or more for premium seating.

&amp;#x200B;

All these estimates are very rough, and most likely wrong as I have no experience with concerts, though I did try my best to research what I could. Other speculation is welcome!

506,2019-1-12,2019,1,12,17,af5hig,190111 TWICE Throwback Thread,qwertsqwert,1547281114," In todays thread, well reminisce on Twices journey leading up to now. In each thread, well look back at what Twice was like as a group in the past and how they have evolved over time.

On January 10, 2017, it was revealed that Twice would hold their first solo tour, TWICELAND The Opening, announcing stops in cities such as Seoul, Bangkok, and Singapore throughout the rest of the month.

Moreover, on January 11, 2018, the [Candy PopMusic Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ_POfToaVY) was released! This marks the second Japanese MV release, after One More Time.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from these eras or just discuss these eras in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* How do you think Twice handled this tour from an emotional standpoint? How do you think Twice felt upon being told they would be going on their first solo tour? What are your thoughts on the tour as a whole?
* What are your thoughts on Candy Pop in general? How well does it serve as a follow up to One More Time? How well does the song fit Twice's overarching style?
* If you discovered Twice at or before this era, how has your opinion of the group changed since these eras?
* What was your favorite lyrics from this song? Which lines stand out to you? What are your favorite scenes from the MV?
* Which member do you feel was the most underrated during these eras?

While I think we all know Chaeyoung is a phenomenal rapper, and Dahyun and Momo are both talented as well, TWICE isn't exactly known for their raps. HOWEVER. I made it my goal to find some of the more impressive raps and make a little list and such about them. As always, I probably missed some songs to look at and if you'd like me to make note of anything, just leave a comment.

I'm going to split it up into three parts:

1. TWICE's Fastest Raps (including non-TWICE songs)
2. All of Chaeyoung's self-written raps
3. My personal favorite TWICE raps

**PART ONE**

I know that rapping isn't all about speed, but how fast someone is rapping is an easy-to-measure statistic that some people may find fun. I measured the syllables they rapped over how many seconds they rapped for. There are some honorable mentions, but for the sake of keeping this short I'm going to limit it to raps that were faster than 6 syllables per second. Also, I did rough estimates on time (I did this all by hand with a stopwatch) so the numbers may not be perfect but they're close. 

I made a couple of rules; the rap has to be at least 5 seconds long and within a 10 second period. TWICE (and other groups) have a tendency to flip between rappers for the same verse (think Likey, TT, etc.), so I made the measurement based off of total time spent. EX: In Likey, Chaeyoung raps the over 6 seconds, but it's split into 3 and 3. I combined them, and counted all syllables as if it were a full verse and then did the math that way. In the other direction, if the rap were longer than 10 seconds, I took the fastest portion of the rap and limited it to somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds. I'll leave the total syllables/second of the full verse, and then the fast portion in the same comment.

**TOP TEN LIST:**

1. Chaeyoung (Likey): 51 syllables in 6.2 seconds: 8.2 syllables/second. The fastest of her raps in TWICE songs and the only song to reach over 8 syllables per second. **\*Note:** Nayeon also did this part during their ""part switch"" live stage, but she sounded kind of stumbly (that could just be me though). Even so, as someone who doesn't and isn't trained to really rap, that's very good. I'll give her half points toward being on this list.
2. Chaeyoung (Precious Love): 47 syllables in 6.7 seconds: 7 syllables/second. 
3. Momo (Do It Again): 69 syllables in 10 seconds: 6.9 syllables/second. (The whole rap in 13.5 seconds long and Momo raps 84 syllables, for an 6.2 syllables/second. The first 10 seconds is the fastest, though, as the rap slows down at the end during her English line).
4. Dahyun (I'm Gonna Be a Star): 50 syllables in 7.3 seconds: 6.8 syllables/second
5. Dahyun (Merry &amp; Happy): 42 syllables in 6.5 seconds: 6.5 syllables/second
6. Chaeyoung (Ready to Talk): 37 syllables in 5.8 seconds: 6.4 syllables/second.
7. Dahyun (Precious Love): 58 in 9.2 seconds: 6.3 syllables/second.
8. Dahyun (Ready to Talk): 37 syllables in 6 seconds: 6.2 syllables/second
9. Chaeyoung (Merry &amp; Happy):  36 syllables in 5.9 seconds: 6.1 syllables/second
10. Chaeyoung (Do It Again): 51 syllables in 8.3 seconds: 6.1 syllables/second. (The whole rap is 13 seconds and has 73 syllables for 5.6 syllables/second, but starting after her ""how sweet"" and omitting the very last line, she reaches that 6.1 mark).

**Non-TWICE songs**

1. Chaeyoung's rap cover of ""Honey"" (linked below) on Sixteen: 151 syllables over 27 seconds (5.6 syllables/second), but there was a portion where she spit out 43 syllables in 6.3 seconds: 6.8 syllables/second.
2. Chaeyoung's rap in ""Daring Woman"" (linked below): 121 syllables over 28.9 seconds (4.2 syllables/second). While possibly one of her slowest raps, I think this is one of her best. Even so, she ends her verse with 43 syllables in 7 seconds, 6.1 syllables/second. 

**PART TWO**

Chaeyoung has one of the, if not the, best lyric-writing ability in the group. Aside from songs, she's also written a handful of her own raps during covers and live performances. I'm going to link below all of the raps she's wrote for TWICE and TWICE-related content. If anyone knows of more, let me know.

[She wrote her rap in their OST for Two Yoo Project Sugar Man titled ""Daring Woman""](https://youtu.be/Cnex1TJzqAc?t=77)

[She wrote her and Dahyun's rap portion in ""Precious Love""](https://youtu.be/kSs6wjy-NN0?t=183)

[Her Korean rap during their cover of ""Greedy"" originally by Ariana Grande](https://youtu.be/e2MW0_0apc4?t=91)

[Her rap dissing all TWICE haters during their cover of ""Work"" at JYPNation in 2016](https://youtu.be/3BqTaV1oD7c?t=5) (I also think Dahyun wrote her portion of the rap performed right before this but I haven't been able to get confirmation on that)

[Her rap in episode 1 of Sixteen](https://youtu.be/gwdFmD4Yinw?t=40)

[The rap portion of her cover of ""Honey"" in episode 3 of Sixteen](https://youtu.be/gwdFmD4Yinw?t=51)

Also almost every other Sixteen rap that she performs in the video linked in the two above. 

Aside from raps, she also wrote ""Don't Give Up"" from Twicetagram, ""Sweet Talker"" from What is Love?, ""Young &amp; Wild"" from Yes or Yes, and had a hand in writing ""Missing U"" with Dahyun and ""Eye Eye Eyes"" with Jihyo.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART THREE**

My favorites, specifically my top 5. This is going to only be raps from TWICE songs, so I won't include covers and such. However, if we did, Daring Woman and Greedy would likely be on top. 

1. Chaeyoung - What is Love?: I can't really put my finger on it, but something about Chae's rap verse paired with the adorable music video during it... I smile every time.
2. Momo - Do It Again: It wouldn't be my flair if it weren't one of my favorites. She comes on fast, she flows well with the beat. It's a mixture of it being her only ""real"" rap, and honestly I think she did it the best of every member who performed it (when they did this song on Sixteen after Momo was eliminated). 
3. Chaeyoung/Dahyun - Likey: I'm including both of them since they do quick switches on the verse. Even though Dahyun's ""ooo"" and then her dab at the end cemented this as a memorable verse, the lyrics and flow of it are actually very well done and it doesn't feel like a forced, obligatory rap portion, it fits really well with the song.
4. Chaeyoung/Dahyun - Ready to Talk: Again, I'm including both of them since they basically rap the same part but in different areas of the song. This completely caught me off guard the first time I heard it and they both delivered it so well. Chae's is slightly faster, and strangely clearer, but Dahyun is so close behind that it's hard to not put them both at the same level for it.
5. Dahyun - Merry &amp; Happy: Who the fuck knew that the RAP OF A CHRISTMAS SONG would be such a banger? Dahyun's part is literally my favorite part of the whole song. 

Honorable mentions: Chae/Dahyun's verses in Precious Love and TT. Chae's in Jelly Jelly and Do It Again. Momo's one-line raps in most songs (L.O.V.E, Stuck, Jelly Jelly, to name a few). Dahyun's rap in What is Love?

&amp;#x200B;

As ALWAYS; I do all of my work by hand, I don't use programs. Foolish, possibly, but I feel better doing it this way. As a result, though, some of my math may be slightly off. If I missed any raps you feel are worthy of this list, let me know and I can add them. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I didn't pick it up from her, I noticed that in lots of those ""unhelpful guide"" videos, they mention Momo licking her teeth. Like when her mouth is closed, you can see her tongue pressing against her lips because she's licking her teeth. I've been doing this years, but it never really crossed my mind that I do it until I saw this.

Also I've noticed that ever since I started watching TWICE videos, I've been getting slightly ""flirtier"" with friends and it gets worse if I just finished watching VLives or videos with Sana/Momo. 

I'm sure there are a few others I can't think of that you guys will mention.

I wanted to start a discussion of what is everyones favourite era of TWICE.

For me my favourite era is What is Love? this era is the one that really got me listening to KPop properly. The song imo, probably their best CB to date, although DTNA was a BOP. This song just edges it for me as you get a chance to see everyones talent. The girls all caught my eye with their performances live and in MV. School Meal Club especially shone here for me :). Notable mention is Jihyo becoming god.

Let me know your favourite era and why in the comments.

Have a great day!.",23,1

611,2019-1-15,2019,1,15,9,ag2gxa,What do you admire about each Twice member?,CuteTent,1547512014,"**1. Jihyo:** Her work-ethic. Ten years and three month as a trainee is no joke. She wanted to quit so many times, but she stuck through all the bullshit until she got her break. She [deserves all the success](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/8kum9x/spent_half_of_her_life_as_a_trainee_not_knowing/?st=jqwywc5o&amp;sh=45f04f9d) that she's had and will have in the future and will always be my number one bias. She's damn talented and [there's no denying that sweet, honey voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30iMt0uR-rw).


**2. Jeongyeon:** [Her selflessness](https://i.redd.it/5dv7u0opfts11.jpg). She honestly is the [Mom of Twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZlPD7JeqdE). She's always looking out and caring for the other members. Jeongyeon has a [really, really good heart](https://i.imgur.com/INCm4A5.jpg) and I admire that so much. She's also a [little prankster](https://youtu.be/XWfS-0kq-ig?t=34). &gt;:)


**3. Sana:** Her cuteness and energy is obvious, but besides that, even if she's joking, Sana is really caring and thoughtful. Here are some examples:
* [skip to 7:34](https://www.vlive.tv/video/8393)
* [skip to 3:56](https://www.vlive.tv/video/21069)
* [skip to 5:26](https://www.vlive.tv/video/21519)


**4. Chaeyoung:** Her free-spirit. Chaeyoung will always do whatever Chaeyoung feels. She's artistic and she always keeps it real.


**5. Dahyun:** Her swagger. Without a doubt, Dahyun is the [queen of variety shows](https://youtu.be/I--TYvyDr_4?t=224). I also admire Dahyun's love for ONCE. Ever since the beginning, she has always been grateful for the support that ONCE has shown her ([skip to 12:09](https://www.vlive.tv/video/1259)).


**6. Tzuyu:** Her genuineness. Similar to Chaeyoung, Tzuyu will always keep it real. Even though she's the youngest and she doesn't show it often, Tzuyu really cares about the well-being of the other members. For example, that time when [Nayeon pretended she was stuck behind a bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtiUbHMY9Y4) and Tzuyu was ready to move the entire bed by herself. I also adore Tzuyu's [love for animals](https://i.imgur.com/c8qUqtU.jpg).

**7. Momo:** Her dancing talent and [love for food](http://pa1.narvii.com/6388/6715b5cc15f3739b4e4c23dc8abb2e34cabd11a8_hq.gif). Pretty self-explanatory haha.

**8. Mina:** Her elegance.  She isn't nicknamed ""Black Swan"" for nothing. Also, I mentioned this in another comment, but I love how Mina can go from [innocent to fierce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P7NTS3krNI) at the flip of a switch. She's a really [good person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RtX9aV-P8k) too. :)

**9. Nayeon:** Her [love for kids](https://youtu.be/Tm79NPBRZGQ?t=12). It's seriously adorable. Also, I remember a video where Nayeon was distressed at a concert because her earpiece wasn't working, so she couldn't sing properly. She wanted to perform her best for the fans and it upset her that she couldn't. That kind of devotion is really respectable.

After learning about each member a little bit more, it's really clear that they're all really good and genuine people. It's no surprise that their individual personalities can have such a charming effect on a person. It really makes being a part of ONCE that much better.",21,1

Basically anything that maybe people haven't noticed before; vocals that arent in the forefront, or haven't been performed much other than some live shows here and there. 

https://youtu.be/T63Nh293X_M - This performance (and all of their What is Love? Acoustic performances) comes to mind. During TWICELAND when they performed this, each version had something new. Jihyo, Nayeon, Sana, Tzuyu, and even Momo at one point added a little flourish/run at the end of their notes and it sounded so good. 

During the rap portion of Missing U, one of the girls (I think its Mina) sings ""Miss-ing U oo oo oo ooo"" in the background and it sounds so pretty.

And here's a quick Korean lesson to break down the title word by word:

|Korean (HAN)|Korean (ROM)|English|
|:-|:-|:-|
||ol hae|this year|
||jae il|most, best|
||jal|well (adverb)|
| |han il|thing that has been done|

* How well do you think this song fits Twices concept as a whole? How does this track show the evolution of Twice as an entire group?
* In your opinion, how well does TBTIED convey emotions associated with the December holiday season? What method(s) does the song use to accomplish this?
* What do you like about Twice thats unique to this era?
* How well does this era serve as a conclusion to Twice's 2018?
* If you discovered Twice at or before this era, how has your opinion of the group changed since this era?
* What was your favorite lyric from this song? Which lines stand out to you? What are your favorite scenes from the MV?
* Which member do you feel was the most underrated during this era?
*  Should Twice film at more exotic locations? If so, where should they film next? 
* Should Twice produce more special albums? What could be a theme for one of these future special albums?

903,2019-1-20,2019,1,20,12,ahtno8,What's the most fun you've seen TWICE have on stage?,Drocar75,1547954187,"Obviously they're performers and smile during songs and such, and I think that with the exception of maybe one or two songs, they all legitimately enjoy singing and dancing to their own songs and covers.

That being said, what performance do you think is the most fun they've had on stage? This can be like a happy joyful fun, a really hilarious fun, or a more emotional and ""I never want this moment to end"" kind of fun.

My vote is the first portion of my examples, [them performing ""Jelly Jelly"" in onesies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPsZB6W4OvA). They just all kind of took this a bit care-free and are just smiling and being playful with the fans the whole time. It's adorable.

I'd love to see more so leave any examples you may think of in the comments!",7,1

Mina would shine SO MUCH!

Tzuyu's vocals would be like a slap in the face to all the Thrice who say that she's just beautiful

Sana would show she's not just an adorable bunny rabbit but someone who can DANCE LIKE A BOSS and sing amazing!

Nayeon and Jihyo are 2 amazing vocalists and it would show.

Jeongyeon could show her realy voice, sassiness and all.

Momo would SLAY with more lines because THE WHOLE SONG IS HERS! And Imagine if it was like her Vampire dance like HOLY MOLY! She would kill us with her cute sexiness!

but I always had a soft heart for TWICE. So I decided to really get to know more about the group and BOII I was wrong many things about the members:

**I was 100% sure Dahyun was the leader**. Certainly because of her personality. I thought that, as a leader, she always tried to ease the mood for her members.

** I never saw Jihyo before**. One of the reasons is definetely because I don't like large groups, so I always forget about members. But in TWICE's case, the only I really didn't see that much, and didn't even knew she was in, was Jihyo.

**Visual? Mina**. Like, I get that Tzuyu is also goddess af, but I thought Mina was the true visual. Also, it fucking blows my mind that she is a 97 line. She's one year younger than me but BRUUH, I never saw a girl that beautiful in my age. (and I live in a place considered to have the most beautiful women in Brazil)

**Sana is the oldest**. I don't know why, but I see a motherly face in her, so my mind automatically said she was the oldest. Never crossed my mind that Nayeon would be the one.

**Chaeyoung was not a rapper**. I think it's because of her face. Since I didn't know how to recognize members by their voice, I never thought she was the one rapping. She has such a cutie face that my mind could not relate her with rapping.",44,1

1046,2019-1-23,2019,1,23,5,aiqzc0,What would you like to see TWICE (or individual members) improve or expand on this year?,Drocar75,1548188413,"While they are majestic creatures of magnificent beauty and talent, its foolish to say they're truly perfect and unable to improve. Now, the improvements may be small or not directly related to performing, but are existent. 

If you do think they really should stay 100% exactly as they are; what's something you enjoyed that they've done in the past that you would like to see more of? 

I'll give two examples, one of each of the above. I have more, but, I want to leave stuff left for people to comment. 

Improvement: Singing. Now, before you get upset, let me explain. When compared to some of the vocal powerhouse groups like GFriend and Red Velvet, people often make fun of TWICE for being bad singers. This is not the case. TWICE is actually quite good at singing, and cover a range of ""styles"" of singing. Mina's soft falsetto, Nayeon's high voice, Jihyo and Jeongyeon with lots of power, Sana's cutesy-ness. They're all good singers, or better, with steady control. 
HOWEVER
That's not to say they can't improve, or atleast ""mature"" themselves. As they grow older and time passes, their style is taking change and adapting. It's only natural. Their voices must change and adapt with them, as well, though. Sana and Momo both tend to (whether by choice or by the company's recommendation) sing in a slightly higher pitch than they're comfortable. Sana sang Nayeon's part in Yes or Yes at one of the awards shows and she is singing a bit more through her chest than her head, it sounds terrific. 
On a similar path, I think that they should take more risks vocally during their B-Sides. I understand not wanting to in the title tracks. They started to in 2018 and it was great. Listen to Ho! or Sunset or After Moon. All of them sound great, but specifically Jihyo, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon have just more of a chance to showcase their vocals and pop off. 


Expand on: Songwriting (and producing). With the exception of Tzuyu, each member has had a hand in songwriting. Chaeyoung has written several alone, including many raps in songs that were not written by her. Both of the songs Jihyo wrote alone (Ho! and Sunset) are some of the best songs in their discography. I really think that their self-written songs just give them, as a group, more confidence and joy when recording. Something about the way those songs sound in comparison. 

Chaeyoung and Jeongyeon have both expressed an interest in producing and I would be very curious to see how that goes. Like with their self-written songs, I wonder how different a self-produced song would sound. They could really put their full twist on it. 



Also. 

Chae is one of the best female rappers in K-Pop with not many opportunities to show that. She's also a very talented singer. I hope 2019 is the year of Chaeyoung. ",12,1

1089,2019-1-23,2019,1,23,23,aj0c2h,Quick shout out to my favorite K-Pop channel on YouTube,Drocar75,1548254462,"The channel is Form of Therapy. He is a video producer and a lover of K-Pop. He's Korean-American (? I think. He lives in America but I dont actually know if he was born here or not), and he does primarily reaction videos. BUT they're not your typical reaction videos. Lots of reaction channels just lose their shit and pause alot and overact, but this guy is super chill.

He's an actual video producer, and he spends lots of his time during reactions talking about shots and sets and the music progression. He's honest and upfront with his views on the song. 

Now, why am I posting this here? He's done several TWICE reaction videos. Knock Knock was the first (see it here: https://youtu.be/FpCu1wmB18E) and he has done every comeback, minus Signal, since then. The reason I'm posting this is because it's really cool to watch him because a TWICE fan. He mostly starts out with ""They're alright"" and doesn't know anyone besides Jeongyeon. As time goes on, he starts learning their names and eventually basically says ""Yep, I love TWICE.""

He also did a listening party for Yes or Yes where he reacted to their whole album, and what he said about Sunset and After Moon was spectacular. He's a very real reactor and very intelligent with music. He managed to point out some things even I have missed after dozens of listens and watches. 

I recommend you check him out if you have any interest in this kind of stuff. ",13,1

1241,2019-1-26,2019,1,26,7,ajumw9,190125 TWICE Throwback Thread,qwertsqwert,1548455971," In todays thread, well reminisce on Twices journey leading up to now. In each thread, well look back at what Twice was like as a group in the past and how they have evolved over time.

Twice held their first international Showcase Tour, Twice Showcase Live Tour 2018, from 19 January to 1 February 2018, in which they toured various venues throughout Japan. This event was the group's first solo tour outside Korea, and as [Candy Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ_POfToaVY) had been released only a few weeks prior, this song would serve to be the focus of the tour. Twice would go on to hold their 1st Japan Arena Tour (BDZ) later that year, as well as their 1st Japan Dome Tour (#Dreamday) the following year, 2019 - a first in the K-Pop industry among girl groups.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* What are your thoughts on the Showcase tour as a whole? Are you excited for the Dome Tour set to be held later this year?
* What do you think of Twice's Japanese discography in general?
* If you discovered Twice at or before this era, how has your opinion of the group changed since this era?
* Which member do you feel was the most underrated during this era?

I would post more, but I want to leave enough open for people to comment. Similarly, (try to) keep it to just a couple lines or maybe a full verse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jihyo - Sunset: 

""It seems to be getting away.  
I look forward to hugging you  
Getting closer and closer  
Boy, somehow resembles you  
Somehow resembles you""

  
Chaeyoung - Don't Give Up:

""Pick up your crayons,  
fill your heart's canvas.  
Don't doubt your conviction,  
Don't hesitate again.  
Tell me everyday,  
Cheer up baby! Don't give up!""

&amp;#x200B;

Jeongyeon - Love Line:

""When I close my eyes, it gets clearer  
I look at you and I still miss you  
Do you know my heart?  
I want to be pulled, dont let go of this line  
So we can fall more into the pink light  
Fill up my heart""

&amp;#x200B;

TWICE - Precious Love:

 ""I was stupid for not knowing  
how much pain you had.  
The eyes that looked at me  
were eyes that withstood tears.  
At that time I didn't realize how precious  
that love was. You don't know how much  
I regret letting you go.""  ",5,1

The Story Begins: Funny and charged!

Page Two: Its B-sides are completely different from Cheer Up, they got a more rude concept like Im Gonna Be a Star and Tuk Tok.

TwiceCoaster Lane 1 and 2, Signal and What is Love: The traditional cuteness, twicecoaster's songs being the more sticky (I don't know if you understand) .

twicetagram: Not clear, all is different.

Yes or Yes: Mature and calm, Sunset, Young and Wild and Lalala show it.

My favorite album is Signal, but the concept I love the more is Yes or Yes one, the only thing I don't like from the album is that almost all the songs are poor in raps.",0,1

1361,2019-1-28,2019,1,28,23,ako5ir,Positive Unpopular Opinions,Drocar75,1548687328,"Note: POSITIVE. 

This is for all of your POSITIVE unpopular opinions. Now, I know lots of you probably think that unpopular opinions are generally controversial and rude, so this is where you can list your positive unpopular opinions. For the purposes of this, I think that things that are unpopular to this sub are a good basis, but K-Pop as a whole is fine too. (EX: Chaeyoung is an underrated rapper and a K-Pop unpopular opinion would be that she's actually exceptional but cant show it. On this sub, that's a pretty popular opinion. That wouldn't really apply here.)


""RULES"": 

Upvote comments you either agree with or you think are well-thought out and abide by the rules of this thread. Do not downvote someone just because you disagree; instead, try and engage in a friendly discussion about it. 

Similarly, opinions that are viewed as negative or offensive or attacking the group or other people should be reported or kept quiet. There may be a place for those to be discussed, but it is not this thread.

As always, be polite. If you do disagree and do want to discuss your differences, dont attack that person or their opinion. Simply state why you have yours. 



Some bad examples:

""X is not as good as everyone thinks she is.""

""Y deserves more/less lines."" Its popular to want some of them (Chae, Jeongyeon) to get more lines. Its negative to think someone shines too much. 

Half-positive comments are okay, but word them carefully: ""I think X is actually better at singing/dancing than Y now, because X has really improved and gained more confidence."" Is much better than ""X is better than Y because Y is overrated and not very good.""

Here are mine:

This seems pretty split on this sub in particular, but international K-Pop fans as a whole tend to think that TWICE should change their concept. Personally, I think that this is exactly what they should do. Maybe maturing slightly over time, but right now every group seems to be going for that hiphop/r&amp;b feel with girlcrush/dark concepts. It may hurt their American success, but TWICE is shining and DOMINATING charts and sales in Asia and should do exactly what they're doing.

I think that while Tzuyu has improved the most out of all members since debut. Her singing, dancing, presence, and confidence have shown improvement since Sixteen, Jihyo's confidence boost and dancing improvements has been the most effective in TWICE's stage presence. Being the main vocalist and the leader, lots of attention is on her. If she's struggling, it rubs off on the fans and the members. Even though she was NEVER fat or overweight, you can visibly see her confidence and happiness since she's been focusing more on staying really fit. It has only positively affected herself and the other members.

Momo, Sana, and Jihyo are the top 3 at executing the choreography. NOTE: I am not necessarily saying they are the best dancers*, I still think that Mina is #2. However, I think that Sana and Jihyo are just so good at performing the choreography itself, if that makes sense. Jihyo's presence is remarkable. 

Moving forward, a majority of the songs should be written by the members, specifically Chaeyoung and Jihyo. The songs written by the members are some of the better ones in their discography, and just have that extra feeling to them BECAUSE it's their own words. Chaeyoung's lyrical ability and Jihyo's attention to detail to the beat (making parts of the song pop with the instrumental) are incredible.

1423,2019-1-29,2019,1,29,22,akzxiz,"How ""real"" are Twice?",6363duck,1548767997,"What do you think the members ""real"" personalities are? I know they are pretty genuine but I am sure they are different off camera, there are a few reasons I think there  are differences in what we see.

Note: this is not negative, I want the girls to be who they are and have private vs public persona.

Nayeon: I think she is pretty much exactly who she is on camera. I think she has quite alot of idol and industry friends and is close with them, as she is older than her members she probably talks with them more. She mentioned once that she met Jihyo when she was out with her friends. I think she meets in restaurants and drinks when there. I think she wants to spend time around people of the same age and be a bit carefree. She will date soon if she isn't already.


Jeongyeon: I think she is most different, she enjoys drinking regularly and swears in her every day language. (Like any normal 20ish woman). She doesn't talk openly about going out with friends and I think she is a little more introverted and sensitive than she lets on. I think her natural way of joking is more adult (ruder rougher) than her on camera persona. I think we would be surprised by how normal she is an not so ""JYP"".


Momo: you see Momo switch on and off, her dance is very focussed and professional but she is much more relaxed day to day. I think when she is stressed she would become introverted and I also think she works out and dances alot more than she talks about. I think she is a little isolated when not with the members. 


Sana: Jihyo mentioned on the hidden camera deleted VLive that Sana would not be happy with being secretly filmed. I think she is naturally cute but of course is serious sometimes and quiet so is careful not to let people see this side of her. People are still shocked by the time she told off the girls in Sixteen. She is very private about her social life and goes off-grid back in Japan. I suspect she has a close group of friends from school and her family. She does drink sometimes and I think she is the only J-line with a social group in Korea.


Jihyo: Again I think she is quite different, she has her own social life outside of twice, she is the leader so has a different role when with the members. Jeongyeon has said that she is highly ranked and the girls all listen to her. I think she has duties as leader we don't see, she is basically the link between members and management so she has to share messages and no doubt give some scoldings too, I think she holds the joint spending and arranges the dorm in terms of who pays for what. I think they are alot more stressed than they let us know and Jihyo has mentioned shouting at the members a few times and is known for being firey. She is also known for being really nice so I think it's bursts of anger. They all love her. I also think she drinks regularly and goes out with friends when she can. I don't think she has many friends outside of the industry. Many of them are friends with designers and stylists etc.


Mina: Black Swan? More like black sheep. I think she is very independent and quiet in the dorms, she likes to play computer games and go shopping alone. She is known for lying in bed for long periods of time. I think she is isolated in Korea but doesn't have many friends in Japan either. I think she is funny and the members will gravitate to her when they want a quiet chat.


Dahyun: Another introvert, she has loads of charisma but needs to recharge. I think she is quite serious and quiet at the dorm. We know she has a religious background I think she is probably most conservative of the group. I think she may have a few friends in the industry but not many. I don't think she drinks much if at all and will probably not date until she is looking to marry.



Chaeyoung: She is quite alternative and arty as we all know, her hobbies are different from the girls so I think she has friends with similar interests outside of the group. From what the members say she is most laid back, she doesn't care too much about stuff and says ""yes"". She is also a bit of a teenager in that she gets bored and I think she gets mock annoyed with the members and they treat her like the little sister because she is small and second youngest.


Tzuyu: The members shared that she cries the most, I think she is very sensitive and can feel the burden of situations, she is probably a worrier, concerned about her own performance and the welfare of fans and members. She doesn't share emotions well but is vocal about her opinions she has a strong stance on right and wrong and also has high personal standards. For example she tells the unnies off when they are rude or not making good lifestyle choices. She doesn't drink and has a strict diet and beauty regime. I think her blunt way of talking is cultural, which is why she doesn't think she is. She has some friends in Korea but I don't think she goes out much with them. She gets homesick often and wishes she was in Taiwan, although I think when she goes her mum puts her on parade a little and she must feel like she is always on show. She also has a killer sense of humour and can floor the members with her sillyness and sarcasm, she doesn't take their crap either.


Because the girls spend alot of time together they have said before that they don't hang out very often. Sometimes they say ""this is our first meal together in so long"" which shows that when they have a choice they choose to either split into smaller groups or do their own thing. They get on like sisters but also are colleagues so have to balance the two and make sure they don't fall out 9 girls are unlikely to all get on all of the time. In the background of Vlives you can see them often sitting solo on thier phones too. 


What do you guys think?

As for the video; I have two answers to this. For those who recognize my username by now, you'll know I am always and forever a Momo stan. She is the entire reason I even started following K-Pop, let alone TWICE. Her Hit the Stage performances drew me in after I listened to Likey and TT. The group as a whole, however, won me over during one of their idol room episodes; https://youtu.be/gFbMTKIaf4k 

The episode features them, GOT7, BtoB, and GFriend. It wasn't too long after Cheer Up was released. If you don't want to watch the whole thing, here are some of the more viral things that happened in this episode; Momo's Nico Nico Nii/Ohayo that won over Heechul. The Limbo Game where Nayeon proved she is NOT flexible like the other members. Cheer Up 2x speed dance.

The moment I realized I was deep into the fandom was when it started ""affecting"" my daily life. I was playing a game of League maybe a month after I discovered TWICE (Last July) and someone typed ""What is Love?"". Everyone responded with ""Baby dont hurt me"" and I said ""I wanna know know know know"". Part two is when I could tell their voices apart in a song and had memorized their ages and such. 

While I do love their music, their personalities and general entertainment value is what caused me to start and continue following them. ",61,1
