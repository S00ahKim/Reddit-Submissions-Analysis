60,2019-2-2,2019,2,2,0,am3cnu,Welcome to our new moderators!,This-Is-Tony,1549036166,"Hey Once!

Firstly thanks to everyone who applied to join the team. The standard of applications was excellent, and we were thrilled to see so much interest from the community. Don't be deterred in the future if you are disappointed about not succeeding with your application this time around! 

With that said, we are very pleased to introduce you to four new moderators in our team. Please join us in welcoming /u/GodsWithin, /u/TimShin, /u/3pinda, and /u/merqyuri! 

With four new pairs of fresh eyes on the team, we'll have some ideas in the works for improving different areas of the subreddit. You can expect a state of the subreddit post in the near future to give feedback on these ideas before anything gets put into motion.

Finally, with the arrival of our new mods, I'll also be announcing my departure from the team. It has been a pleasure being so heavily involved in this community for almost two years, but its time for me to take a step back.

If you have any questions for our new mods they'd be happy to answer below. We'd also like to open the floor to you all, to give you a chance to provide any ideas, feedback, or input for anything you'd like to see implemented on the subreddit. We'll be sure to take everything on board for our discussions in the coming weeks.",51,1

Disclaimer: The compilations may contain other members' picture that the core member is not in it.

So it is easier for people who wants to download all of them packed up together nicely. Please note that it does not have every single picture that is taken but i try my best to get every single one of them.

113,2019-2-3,2019,2,3,2,amgfyo,TWICE Line Distributions since debut,Drocar75,1549129892,"I've been sitting on this for a while, debating if I should post it or not. I mostly wanted to try and avoid ""my bias does/doesn't get lines"" and general hate toward the company or producers or even other people, but I'm deciding to post it anyway merely to see how the lines are distributed. Toward the end, I'm going to give my own reasoning as to why I think the lines are distributed the way they are. 

A couple notes:

1. This may not be perfect; lines are difficult to measure properly and it is not always clear who is singing during adlibs and such. I used a few different YouTube channels that do distributions regularly; in some cases, they differed by a few seconds per member per song. I took the average of those two (or used my best judgment as to who was singing). Understand that if you do the math yourself, you'll likely get close but different numbers.
2. I will break it down by lines per person per album, then I'll go over strictly Korean title tracks followed by Japanese title tracks, and then I will list the song with each member's most and least lines.
3. I am just recording the numbers and putting them here. I will have my final thoughts at the end of my post; someone who gets more line does not automatically mean they are better or more appreciated or more talented than other members. Producers with much more understanding of music than us have some formula that they follow and while we can complain or criticize, it is not our place to put down and be hostile toward them.
4. I am only including language re-works on particular albums. EX: I am including the Korean version of BDZ from Yes or Yes or Be As One from The Year of Yes, but not the album #TWICE. If you want the answer as to why - I'm lazy and it's easier to calculate this way, and also because it would ""pad"" numbers. The members get the same lines in both versions as opposed to switching based on language. I will also not be counting anything not on an official album - which includes things like sub-unit covers and one-time performances. **IMPORTANT: BDZ was released with Candy Pop, Wake Me Up, Brand New Girl, and One More Time, all of which already got their own album. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TABLE: I included Pink Lemonade and Luv Me (the b-sides for WMU and OMT) in the total for BDZ. Essentially, it is all of their Japanese-release songs.**
5. Also, to make math (and the equation in Excel) MUCH easier, I rounded everything to the nearest whole number (1 minute and 22.4 seconds on an album was listed as 1:22). All in all, by the end, this only makes the difference of no more than four to five seconds per member.

**MEMBERS LINES: Member: Most (time) | Least (time) \*Note: This one is tricky because it is REALLY hard to look at every single individual song accurately. I'm choosing some of the more ""obvious"" ones; while it may not be 100% their highest and lowest, it's likely VERY close to the being there.**

Nayeon: Three Times a Day (60.9 seconds) | Ready to Talk (16.2 seconds)

Jeongyeon: Wishing (32.4 seconds) | Touchdown (4.3 seconds)

Momo: L.O.V.E (29.7 seconds) | Truth (2.2 seconds)

Sana: Merry &amp; Happy (39.4 seconds) | Only You (6.7 seconds)

Jihyo: Truth (66.4 seconds) | Do It Again (13.8 seconds)

Mina: Stuck (39 seconds) | Touchdown (6.8 seconds)

Dahyun: Wishing (24 seconds) | Truth (3.4 seconds)

Chaeyoung: Touchdown (47.8 seconds) | Pink Lemonade (2.1 seconds)

Tzuyu: Brand New Girl (28.8 seconds) | Three Times a Day (4.7 seconds)

\*NOTE TWO: This is the song in which the member had the most lines in comparison to other songs, NOT other members. EX: Momo in L.O.V.E did not have the most lines of every member, but she never has more than 29.7 seconds of lines in another song.

**MY THOUGHTS ON WHY:**

I would like to preface immediately saying this; I don't really\* care about line distributions. I like seeing them and noting some things about them, but I care much more about how much I like the song and HOW the lines are distributed as opposed to who got the most. (EX: Sana's ""Shy shy shy"" is arguably their most iconic and memorable line from ANY of their songs, and it was about 2 seconds). That being said, I DO\* think that there are songs that are just ridiculous - like Chaeyoung not getting a real rap for four title tracks in a row (DTNA, BDZ, Yes or Yes (I do not consider the 2 lines of ""rap"" to be a real rap), and TBIED). Now, onto explanations:

Nayeon gets lots of lines for a few reasons. She's the face and center of the group, she has the most recognizable voice, and she fits this concept really well. Her high voice and cutesy face, mixed with her general child-like maturity (not immaturity, but that she's very mature but still acts like a kid. This isn't an insult I promose), and her overall popularity; it's not a surprise that she gets the most lines. Despite people think her voice is dangerous, she actually has surprisingly good control and texture to the way she sings. Most vocalists would be hurting their voices by constantly mixing like she does, but she sounds very comfortable. It's honestly much more impressive than people assume.

Jihyo: This one is pretty easy. She's the leader and main vocalist. Her job is to carry songs and give them more texture; be it a heavy chorus and some great adlibs in the background. Her control, tone, texture, range, and technique just surpasses the others. 

Jeongyeon: This is the tricky one. I'm going to give an unpopular opinion; Jeongyeon doesn't need more lines. NOW. HOLD ON. Jeongyeon doesn't \*need\* more lines, but I think she is a better vocalist than the producers give her credit for. THE PROBLEM is that Jeongyeon's voice and style is much more mature and ""sharp"" than the other members. She shines in ballads for this exact reason; unfortunately, when it comes to their title tracks, she just doesn't fit the same. If you look at Yes or Yes, where she got more lines, THAT'S the concept she fits better. So, ultimately; She does deserve more lines than she gets, but I understand WHY she doesn't get them. 

Mina &amp; Sana: They are similar to Nayeon's, just in a different direction. Mina's voice is unique and very soft and smooth. Her constant falsetto is something that she has perfected for bridges and pre-choruses. Sana's cute but controlled voice makes it easy for her to draw people in, given their concept, but she actually has a very consistent and underrated voice.

Momo, Dahyun, Tzuyu: Tzuyu has improved alot, and you can see that she has been getting more and more lines recently. I would put her right in with Mina and Chaeyoung in terms of vocal ability. Dahyun &amp; Momo are the weakest vocalists of the group, but they get their lines differently. Dahyun's improvement has been great and she has much better control and reminds me lots of Mina; she's breathy and soft, but controlled; plus her being the other rapper helps push more lines her direction. Momo's voice is being forced in this weird cutesy direction, but it works well with ""killing parts"" (like Likey). She may have the least lines of all the members, but lots of her lines are recognizable and popular. You can hear her real voice come out in some songs, when it's a bit lower and she can sound more mature. 

Chaeyoung: Alright. I'm going to be quick and blunt: I do not have a good explanation for why Chaeyoung doesn't get many lines. I could argue that she's a rapper in a group that doesn't rap much, but even then she's an excellent singer. 

&amp;#x200B;

PERSONALLY, based on concept, voices, popularity, etc. etc... My line distribution order would go like this: Jihyo &gt; Nayeon &gt; Mina = Chaeyoung = Jeongyeon &gt; Sana &gt; Tzuyu &gt; Dahyun &gt; Momo. Basically, I would keep it EXACTLY how it is, but take some of Nayeon's verse lines (not her choruses) and pass them off to Jeongyeon, and just give Chae a few of Sana's verses and atleast ONE of Dahyun's solo raps from 2018 (DTNA, BDZ, or TBIED).

&amp;#x200B;

**THINGS I NOTICED -** This is just a small section for ""fun facts"" and other things. 

Jihyo's near 67 seconds in Truth is longer than the entirety of Momo's lines on The Story Begins, Page Two, and basically ties her lies on Signal (the album). It is also higher than Tzuyu's lines on Signal and ties Dahyun on TSB.

Momo has more songs with less than 5 seconds of lines than any other member. 

The top three (Jihyo, Nayeon, and Mina) combined for 49.8% of the lines - the other SIX members make up the rest. Jihyo and Nayeon alone are nearly 39%.

With the exception of maybe Touchdown for Chaeyoung, I wouldn't consider of the songs listed above to be the most iconic song for that member. EX: Nayeon and Jihyo had over a minute in 3/day and Truth respectively, but I wouldn't consider those to be the B-side tracks they are known for.

I can imagine her in a drama where she gets sick, keeps it a secret, and dies in the end... not that I would want that for her!! I mean, after her character captures our hearts with her charm and smile, I feel like that kind of plot twist will give the most impact. It sort of also dramaticize how she's been giving her all in real life, smiling brightly despite the negativities and hardship, and being humble and selfless to to the point that she lets other members take the spotlight instead of just taking care of herself.",8,1

159,2019-2-4,2019,2,4,5,amtmjs,TWICE Positions (Personal opinion) going into 2019 (mostly for new ONCEs),Drocar75,1549225745,"This is primarily for newer fans who aren't completely familiar with ""positions"", or even how they ""work"" in K-Pop. I'm expecting some of the more hardcore and longer fans to have their own input and likely disagree with some points I make. This isn't meant to put down any members or anything, but it's more so to show what the members bring to the group.

For those who don't know; most K-Pop groups have ""positions"" like main and lead vocalists, dancers, rappers, etc. as determined by the company and/or the group. The company will usually choose, but in TWICE's case they have some say; like voting Jihyo as the leader. You can find their profiles online at this site: [https://kprofiles.com/](https://kprofiles.com/) but I feel like some of the things they have on there need slight updating. Which is why I'm here; to interject my opinions on everything. Again: This is my opinion of how I would place them given their presence, lines, technique, and lines. I'll start with Jihyo (the leader) and from there go by age (I'll be using non-Korean age when displaying them).

**Vocal Line (the main and leads): Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Mina**; honorable mention to Chaeyoung, who I would put here if she got the chance to sing more often.

**Dance Line (the main and leads): Momo, Sana, Mina, Tzuyu, Jihyo**; honorable mention to Nayeon, who was (for lack of a better term) ""kicked"" out by Jihyo's incredible, skyrocketing improvement in dancing.

**Rap Line (the main and leads): Chaeyoung, Dahyun**; honorable mention to Momo, who (like Chaeyoung in vocal) I would put here if she got the chance to rap more often.

&amp;#x200B;

**Park Jihyo, 22 years old (Feb. 1st, 1997), Korean** \- Main Vocalist, Leader, Lead Dancer. As the main vocalist, Jihyo is considered to have the best tone and technique in the group, and as the leader she is generally in charge of the group; taking the reins during promotional interviews, handling the group funds and planning, and just generally being there for the members. Her dancing and stage presence has improved SO much since debut, I think she deserves the ""lead dancer"" title. She still has some movements of stiffness, but her facial expressions while dancing and hitting those adlibs is pretty impressive given she was considered ""below average"" at debut. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Im Nayeon, 23 years old (Sept. 22nd, 1995), Korean -** Lead Vocalist (1), Center. I put the (1) there because I feel like, while there are multiple lead vocalists, she's the ""first option"". Her technique is a little bit rougher than Jeongyeon's, but her tone and style suit TWICE songs arguably the best of any member. Center is a bit tricky; TWICE is pretty good at having the center be whoever is singing, which is not something all groups do. However, Nayeon is generally in the middle during choreos due to her having the chorus and usually the opening to a song. If you like at choreos like Knock Knock, DTNA, Heart Shaker, she's the one most often at center stage. I think her dancing is actually pretty underrated, but I didn't give her a lead dancer spot because I tried limiting it to the top 5 dancers, and I would put Nayeon 6th. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Yoo Jeongyeon, 22 years old (Nov. 1st, 1996), Korean** \- Lead Vocalist (2) - Just as above, the (2) is because she's the second option of the lead vocalists. The way she uses her voice is very good, and probably a bit better than Nayeon, but that's mostly because of the lines they get. Jeongyeon's technique is on par or slightly better than Nayeon's, but the actual tone of her voice is more suited for more mature stuff. That's why she excels at singing in their ballads, or their more mature pop songs like Yes or Yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Hirai Momo, 22 years old (Nov. 9th, 1996), Japanese** \- Main Dancer, Rapper, Sub Vocalist - Momo's position as the main dancer is undeniable. Her ability to learn and perform the choreography, mixed with her presence on stage is completely unmatched by any other member (and honestly, it's pretty hard to get on her level even from other main dancers from other groups). Her role in the group is to lead and absolutely CRUSH the dancing. Unfortunately, she suffers through her voice. NOW, she had a great voice during Sixteen and there are some songs and covers they've done when you hear her more mature, lower-register voice, but she's being pushed toward a higher voice to fit the concept better. Even though it's been a while since she's had an actual rap verse, lots of her lines are ""fast-singing"" lines that are half-rap, half-singing (listen to her lines in Stuck or L.O.V.E to get an idea of what I mean). Check out my flair; this girl can rap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Minatozaki Sana, 22 years old (Dec. 29th, 1996), Japanese** \- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Face of the Group - Sana's title for ""face of the group"" is a bit up in the air, but I gave it to her based on just personal assumption. Given the nature of how easily viral she becomes, on top of being considered one of the most beautiful girls in the industry, combined together with her popularity overall; she's likely the first member people think of when you mention TWICE, or is the most recognizable to the general public that don't listen to their music. Her dancing is excellent; she's not terrific at freestyle or freeform dancing, but I would actually put her second to Momo in terms of performing the choreography and keeping good facial expressions. Her voice is very good, but she's just not on the same level as most of the other ""vocal team"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**Myoui Mina, 21 years old (Mar. 24th, 1997), Japanese** \- Lead Vocalist (3), Lead Dancer - The third option as a lead vocalist; her technique and versatility doesn't quite match that of Nayeon's or Jeongyeon's, but her style is very unique. She almost ALWAYS sings in a falsetto or soft chest, which is excellent for pre-choruses and bridges during a build up, as well as during their softer, more ballad-style B-sides. Her dancing level in general is pretty incredible, and she would easily be a main dancer in other groups. Her style outside of the group (ballet, gymnastics, contemporary-type dance) makes her a shoe-in as a great dancer. The main downfall is that her more classical-dance training is very different from how TWICE does their choreography; while her technique is great and she rarely makes mistakes, her most comfortable spot is just elsewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Kim Dahyun, 20 years old (May 28th, 1998), Korean** \- Lead Rapper, Sub Vocalist - Her singing has been improving with each comeback, and it seems like it will only continue to. Much like Mina; she's very soft and delicate, and rarely strains much. Her potential is incredible, but I am giving her the ""sub vocalist"" position strictly because, while I agree she's good, I wouldn't put her up with Sana or Tzuyu or Chaeyoung, nor does she get as many vocal lines; but I hope she continues to and eventually does move into that group. Her rapping style really fits TWICE, as her voice is (again) pretty soft but has a nice little swag to it (EX: Likey). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Son Chaeyoung, 19 years old (April 23rd, 1999), Korean** \- Main Rapper, Vocalist - Damn this girl can sing, but she just doesn't do it much, but her technique is great. She supports herself very well with low notes and does well getting high, but her projection is her downfall. **DAMN THIS GIRL CAN FUCKING RAP TOO.** No joke, I know TWICE isn't really a hip-hop group and Chaeyoung isn't normally considered a ""great rapper"" by non-TWICE fans, but I think she's one of the best female rappers in the industry right now, with so few chances to show it. Her voice isn't dark or hard like others, but she excels at R&amp;B Pop raps (listen to her rap on Daring Woman or Greedy). She's one of the main songwriters of the group as well. While the songs themselves aren't necessarily my favorites (not her fault), it's undeniable (to me) that her lyrical writing is unmatched in the group. On top of solo writing several TWICE songs (and helping with others), she wrote a majority of her own raps on the covers they've done, and also wrote (almost) all of her Sixteen raps. I made a post about her raps a while ago about it, look through my history or search the sub for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Chou Tzuyu, 19 years old (June 14th, 1999), Taiwanese** \- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Visual, Maknae - Visual is subjective, obviously, but she is considered the prettiest in the group in most parts of Korea/Japan where they promote the most. This doesn't seem to hold true in most English-speaking countries, however; I have the position here for her, but it's the one that people disagree with the most. While in Korea, her and Chaeyoung are technically the same age, her birthday comes later and she would turn 20 after Chaeyoung in other parts of the world. Her vocal tone and technique have been improving alot, I would put her right there with Chaeyoung and just below Mina. However, I didn't give Tzuyu or Chae ""lead"" positions due to how much they actually sing. They're good singers who continue to improve, but they're just below the leads in terms of ""usage"" and ability. Her dancing has been getting better as well, though it hasn't quite skyrocketed up like Jihyo's did. Tzuyu's largest issue while dancing is her height; her moves don't look quite as sharp or fluid because she physically has more space to cover in the same amount of time. Even so, she manages to add her own little flares to the choreography that make her stand out. I'd place her and Jihyo around the same performance level; I think Tzuyu is a better dancer, but Jihyo's presence is masterful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is all merely my own opinions of where they're at in the group based on their talents and their usage of the company. While I think I'm pretty accurate, I do expect people to disagree or make arguments about how the members are placed. I tried my best to explain WHY I gave them the positions I did, and give praise to them and showing how they have/are improving. They are all good singers and above average dancers, I feel like putting ""lead"" or ""main"" for everything would be a bit boring and not entirely true. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I don't make anyone too angry, and if you do disagree with me or anyone who comments, do try and be civil and understand that you're arguing a point, not a person.",26,1

262,2019-2-6,2019,2,6,12,anma4r,Brag about your bias,Drocar75,1549422635,"Just a friendly thread to brag about your bias and what makes you love them! Obviously there will be a bit of overlap, but I think it'd be cute. Maybe you notice some things or have seen videos that really stand out that people who don't normally follow them wouldn't see. Share a video, story, or just point out general things about them. I'm sure MOST people follow more than JUST their bias, but I also feel like there's a decent amount of people who probably feel one or two of the members are clearly ""less entertaining"" to them.

As always: THIS IS FOR FUN. Not everyone is drawn to the same thing, so there are bound to be some disagreements. That being said; this thread is for fun, cute, interesting videos and to provide some insight to members that others might not have noticed. If someone posts videos or shares something about someone you consider ""boring"", just move on. No need to get nasty toward the members or other users. Whoever is at the top of your bias list is probably at the bottom of someone else's; and whoever is at the bottom of yours is probably someone's far and away favorite. Just be polite.

&amp;#x200B;

ON TO THE BRAGGING. (I could talk about her forever, but I'm going to keep this fairly short).

Momo. Jesus. This woman is something else. She's gorgeous, she's talented, she's funny. Here are some of my favorite videos of her dancing. Examples of her being the sun that shines: [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/twicemedia/comments/9qr4pc/momo/), [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/twicemedia/comments/a2t8ad/momo/), [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/twicemedia/comments/9s0xdm/momo/), and [Example 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/twicemedia/comments/an42zy/momo/). Honorable mention to literally every other photo of her.

[My House by 2PM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yIElUuaIBU) this is one of the very first Momo dance videos I saw. I have watched this upwards of 100 times and I have never once found it boring. The way she hits that shoulder shake with the hair flip is incredible.

[Call Me Baby by EXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDwoWvEb_BA) and then a small portion of the dance in high quality [here](https://youtu.be/_XFbssP6ZVo?t=67). One of my favorite K-Pop dances in general, and even better watching her do it. Because of all the body rolling in the dance, I honestly think she does it just as well as Kai, if not even a bit better.

[I Think About You by Jun K of 2PM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LzMVz-t20k) Just watch it. That's all.

Obviously there are several more, but these are some of the ones worth mentioning that are probably under the radar of people who don't actively search them.

HER VOICE. Okay, so this is a tough one; Momo had a very good voice in Sixteen that I would put on par with Tzuyu's, but since it has faded a bit. Whether by her own choice or the producers, she's using a slightly higher-pitched cutesy voice to fit the concept of TWICE better than her more mature voice. It's hard for her to control in live performances, BUT it still has moments of greatness. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBvePv3JOIw) is fun, listen to the second clip about 15 seconds in. It's her small portion of Melting/Ice Cream from Lane 2. She sounds SO GOOD. It's high pitched, but its a controlled little falsetto and it sounds so smooth rather than nasally. [Also this from a few weeks ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IezlApx3xlM) she's singing in a lower register, where she is much more comfortable, and she sounds much better. Hopefully this comes back.

ALSO LOOK AT MY FLAIR.

&amp;#x200B;

Her personality

Momo is teased by the group (and fans) for being a little bit slow. While it may be tougher for her to catch on to some of the jokes, I find her to be very mature and emotionally sound. She has her moments of vulnerability, and she's SO gay for the other girls, but other members have always spoke about her patience and willingness to listen. She always seems to be able to tell when other members are uncomfortable or unhappy, and she's always trying to best to cheer them up. She feeds off the energy of those around her, and always does her best to include people. All of the girls do, honestly. Momo just has a presence about herself... I can't take my eyes off her. Her ""dumbness"" is more adorable than annoying, and seeing her confused is very charming. She takes it in strides and laughs at herself, or atleast makes it easy to not feel bad about it when people are laughing ""at"" her. [Like when she orders food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB9FH7sjA9g). Most importantly, though, my favorite thing about Momo is her love for food. She's so fit and hard-working, but she cannot resist good food. It's an admirable trait, I love how her (and the other members) don't try and like... force themselves to not eat or give up food. Yes, they have at times and especially as trainees, but now it seems like they've relaxed themselves. Obviously they still eat healthy, but that doesn't shy them away from chowing down when it comes time.

&amp;#x200B;

As a parting note, here is my favorite Momo fancam ever.

What's your favorite part about this track? For me, it's the arrangement, which shows a large shift in tone from previous title tracks. The most obvious example of this is Tzuyu/Sana covering the first chorus rather than Jihyo/Nayeon, and other arrangement decisions like this one add up to produce an entirely new sound from the group that, up to that point, we had never heard before.

If this was your first Twice era, what were your first impressions of Twice?

Could be also the same here for Likey and WIL.

From the looks of things WIL might be their lead single afterall since its what they performed on Music Station. So here's hoping they do a reshoot like TT.

I was wondering if there are any official/unofficial-but-reliable updates since then, such as:

* When will Twice have their next comeback? (Korean or Japanese)
* When is the rumored US Tour most likely to take place?
* Are there other tours/concerts that you think will happen in the year besides the Japan Dome Tour and rumored US Tour?
* As a PH Once, I think this is highly unlikely, but do you think they will ever have a concert in the PH? lol
* Do you think Twice will have sub-units or other projects involving certain members this year?

I understand there's a sort of ""Twice drought"" going on though I really don't mind since the members are getting their much deserved rest! There also aren't really any activities based on their official schedule.

Thanks, everyone! I hope you're all as well rested as our dear Twice members.",27,1

[""SIGNAL""](https://youtu.be/VQtonf1fv_s) reached 200M YouTube views yesterday! Congratulations to our girls!!

Moreover, the [What is Love? -Japanese ver.-](https://youtu.be/3zQXMPbK5jU) was released earlier today!

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* How well do you think the visuals of these music videos match their respective songs?
* What differences do you notice between the [Korean What Is Love?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0p1bmr0EmE) and this version? Do you have a preferred version between the two?
* Among Twice M/Vs, which are your favorites?
* If you discovered Twice at or before either of these eras, how has your opinion of the group evolved since then?

Check out past threads in the [Twice Throwback Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/wiki/discussionarchive/twicethrowback).",1,1
361,2019-2-8,2019,2,8,18,aoeq1v,Candy Bong 2.0 rumors.,zetsupetsu,1549616449,"So according to a reliable Once fan site, a withdrama employee accidentally mentioned that they will start selling Candy Bong 2.0 on March when asked about Candy Bongs on stock. She probably thought it was already announced officially.

So this is most likely hinting on another Twiceland tour, likely going to be a world tour this time to coincide with the US tour reports.


Also, candy bong 2.0 might mean new official Twice colors, and that means a change in concept?",12,1

387,2019-2-9,2019,2,9,7,aoltvv,"Do you think it's fair to judge Twice capabilities as a girl group, by only their Title Tracks?",MajorIvan88,1549664306,"With the recent article like [this one](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=262991) [[reddit topic here]](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/amxiz1/music_critic_jung_minjae_shares_his_strong/).
And the recent episode with JYP Super Intern where Twice spoke about their concerns. [[reddit topic here]](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/alqnwg/super_intern_e02/) It got me thinking about Twices perception in the kpop world. 

Twice themselves feels like, they are getting written off as the ""Cute Girl Group"" by the general audience and casual kpop listeners on the basis of their Title Tracks and members are worried about people getting bored at their current image.

I've watched videos of people listing their favorite Twice tracks and it only contains their Title Tracks. When it comes to why not including any b-sides, the general answer is 
""I don't listen to the albums"". 

Which imo is kinda a shame/disservice, since Twice b-sides more often have Gems that can even overshadow the Title Track (Sunset f.e.).
All the members hard work in writing songs for their albums gets unnoticed by supposed Twice fans and general audience.
I mean seriously you can type in Twice Album on YouTube to listen all of them. (Can't be that hard, right?)

When they comeback, you get a responses like ""Oh it's a typical catchy Twice Song"".  - Which then them back to the ""Cute Girl Group""- niche. 
It's not the girls fault. I would say it's JYPE ""fault"" on how they want to market Twice in the kpop world and yeah they are not wrong (Asias no.1 Girl Group).

Well after all this ramble (hopefully it made sense), what do you guys and gals think?",10,1

If I'd wanted to buy signed merchendise, we're would the best place be? A signed photocard is fine, but want to buy it from a trusted seller so I know it's genuine. I'm living in Europe if that matters. But I don't mind any shipping costs.

*(To be more specific, Im searching for a Nayeon photocards (and maybe Jihyo), I case one of you is selling his or hers)*

I've never bought anything like this. So I'm not really sure how to properly keep it/care for it. The photobook is really just paper (tbh i thought it would be more like glossy/magazine paper). Paper tends to become yellow/brown as time passes. So I was wondering if there was a way to prevent this from happening.

Thanks, guys.

On another note, I am just overjoyed with my first purchase. Honestly, I can't talk about this with my real life friends because none of them are fans of Twice. And they will probably think I'm insane for spending actual money lol.",15,1

I won't go into detail but basically they have been forced offline. Poor girls. They can't have any public profiles and they can't have any private. Its the internet so people are going to find stuff but publicly outing them is another thing. Why is there no tolerance of them being normal people? They have been on a break for a few weeks and people have gone mad even tracking them down abroad and being obsessed about where they are. It seems to be only idols who have  to live like this take Ariana Grande for example, she has had lots of high profile relationships, she can go ages without a song release she can disappear for ages and come back more relevant than ever. Why are Korean idols not treated the same? Ok rant over lol.",1,1

477,2019-2-12,2019,2,12,10,apnj55,Member who starts the song (split up by album),Drocar75,1549933848,"I'm starting to run low on ideas, so this is what you get. I'm thinking about doing a ""chorus distribution"", but that might take a while as I have to listen to each chorus in every song (since some choruses switch up who sings). Look out for that probably this weekend. If you have any other requests of mundane shit you'd like me to put into quantifiable values for no other reason than your own interest, let me know and I shall provide it for you.

&amp;#x200B;

ONTO THE POST

So I compiled all of the song starts by each member. I considered starting the song as anything where a singular member is clearly singing/saying/rapping the beginning of a song. This is anything as simple as an ""ooo"" or ""yeah!"" to full lines. There is a single exception, Eye Eye Eyes, where Momo and Sana count together at the beginning. This is all 77 UNIQUE songs; meaning I did not count the Korean/Japanese versions of songs that have been re-done in the other language. Similarly, this is why you'll see only 7 songs on the ""Year of Yes"" as opposed to 9. Nor did I include any of the #TWICE or similar songs. While on Spotify Page Two only has 6 songs, the album actually has seven; the notorious ""I'm Gonna Be a Star"" is on that album.

Before I show the table (though it's literally right fucking there), you may ask yourself; What is the importance of starting a song? And the answer is very simple: Absolutely no importance at all. It means virtually nothing. There might be SOME importance in a couple of songs of HOW it starts, like ones that start off with a chorus (Likey, BDZ) or build-up starts (Heart Shaker, Signal), but ultimately it has no significance as to WHO starts it. I just think it's fun to look at.

||The Story Begins|Page Two|TCoaster: L1 &amp; L2|Signal|Merry &amp; Happy|Summer Nights|The Year of Yes|Japanese Releases|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nayeon|2|3|3|2|4|4|0|3|21|
|Jeongers|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|
|Momo|0|0|0|1|2|0|0|1|4|
|Sana|1|1|2|2|3|1|2|1|13|

|Chaebae|0|2|2|1|4|1|0|2|12|
|Tzuyu|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|2|5|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, and probably not surprising to you, Nayeon starts a majority of the songs (about 27%). Chae actually has a surprising amount of starts, though most of them are like... small little hype starts like ""Yeah!"" and ""hey!"" and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tzuyu had the latest start to a song. I used Merry &amp; Happy, as it has all of the Twicetagram songs on it, but technically Jeongyeon's start came first on Twicetagram and Tzuyu's was a couple months later on Merry &amp; Happy (as well as it actually being on the song Merry &amp; Happy).

Chronologically (if you start from the debut song of their first album, Like Ooh Ahh) the very first voice you hear is Nayeon. The Year of Yes is the only album where Nayeon doesn't get a start. Twicetagram/Merry &amp; Happy is the only album where Jeongyeon DOES get a start.

&amp;#x200B;

These numbers mean nothing, this is purely for the meaning of statistics. Jeongyeon getting only 1 and Nayeon getting 21 has no importance or significance, don't look too much into it. Be friendly to the members and the company and the producers. ",1,1

Like the title said, my relationship of 7 years just ended today. While I know it is the right decision and we both agreed it was time, I feel lost and depressed. I was hoping this sub would have some recommendations of Twice related videos that I could watch to keep my mind off of it for at least a short time?

I already watched Sixteen and most of the Twice TV series they have on their vlive. Is there any other variety/reality show that I'm missing out on? I usually just end up re-watching their live performances or concerts.

If you didnt know, BTS has Funko Pop Vinyls coming out, and they look super cute. My GF asked me if I wanted her to make a custom Twice Pop. I thought it would be a cool idea for sure, but were having an issue with what outfits to use. 

Here is an example of what she is thinking:(Momo is my favorite)
https://imgur.com/a/CPPhY7K

(First time posting an image on a Reddit post so fingers crossed, and this is a pretty new idea to us both... she also drew this in a few minutes... She is too talented for me haha)

My GF is now thinking about doing more of these styles with other members, but we are still learning about Twice. (She loves Jihyos red outfit from Yes or Yes so that is on the radar)

So thats where the geniuses of Reddit take over, what are some of the Iconic MV outfits for each member? Keep it civil and thank you for any/all help! ",13,1

644,2019-2-17,2019,2,17,7,are2s5,TWICE Chorus Breakdown (Korean Title tracks),Drocar75,1550357414,"I'll be going over 3 things: Who sings the chorus, my theory as to why they sing the chorus, what the chorus means to the song/the concept. With the exception of the first category, these will obviously be my own takes on them. I've listened to a wide range of music for a long time, so I like to think I'm  pretty confident in my abilities to break down lyrics and messages, but obviously I am not you and you are not anyone else so people will see them differently. As a result, if you do see something different, make your own point as opposed to trying to fight someone else's, I'd love to see how different people relate or interpret the same words.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who Sings the Chorus** 

I'm going to be looking at both who sings, and when they sing (both the order of when in the chorus itself, as well as which chorus, if it changes). Whenever I say ""the first chorus"", ""the only chorus"", etc. I am specifically referring to their Korean title tracks; not B-sides or Japanese songs. Also, I'm only including technical comebacks (ones that were actively promoted and nominated for music/award shows); so I won't be going over TBIED or Merry &amp; Happy (I know this was released with Heart Shaker, but TECHNICALLY Merry &amp; Happy is both the name of the song and the album, so it's kind of the title track).

**Like Ooh-Ahh: Jihyo, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon.** Nayeon and Jihyo sing the first two choruses, switching off going first and second (respectively), then Jeongyeon takes over the first part of the last chorus, where Nayeon would normally sing. Jihyo gets lots of time in this last chorus, singing some pretty powerful adlibs in the background before ending the song on with her final part of the chorus.

**Cheer Up: Jihyo, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon.** Very similar to LOA, Jeongyeon takes over the first part of the last chorus while Jihyo adlibs, however she does Jihyo's part instead of Nayeon's part, meaning Nayeon closes out the song. Jihyo still has a portion, transitioning between Jeongyeon and Nayeon in the middle of the last chorus.

**TT: Jihyo, Nayeon, Dahyun, Mina, and Jeongyeon.** The most ""busy"" of their choruses thus far in their career, all 5 members get a chance. The first 3 sing in each chorus; Nayeon starting, then Jihyo, then Dahyun with her ""nomuhae, nomuhae"" part, and then Jihyo again ending it. In the very last chorus, Mina sings Nayeon's part while she provides a pretty adlib, then Jeongyeon takes Jihyo's part while, again, Jihyo adlibs. Dahyun keeps her part, then Jihyo ends the song with the final portion of the last chorus. 

**Knock Knock: Jihyo, Nayeon, Mina, Momo, Jeongyeon, and Sana.** Immediately beating out the amount of members used in TT, Knock Knock has a very busy (and very catchy) chorus that is sung differently each time. The first chorus: Jihyo and Nayeon take the main parts, with Mina and Momo singing the ""baby kn-kn-kn-kn-knock at my door, kn-kn-kn-kn-knock"". In the second chorus, Sana takes Nayeon's first part, but Nayeon still sings the little part directly after Mina, who keeps her spot (as does Momo). In the last chorus, Jihyo hits us with one of her prettiest adlibs in all of their title choruses, with Nayeon singing. Mina and Momo keep their parts, but Jeongyeon takes over Jihyo's second portion while she continues her background vocals. Nayeon also throws in a few, before Jihyo closes out the chorus.

**Signal: Sana, Tzuyu, Jihyo, Nayeon, Momo, and Dahyun**. The first chorus (of their title tracks) without Jeongyeon, and also the first with Tzuyu. This song also has a different format from the rest, in which there are only 2 choruses instead of 3 throughout the song (sort of). This started the ""Sana-Tzuyu"" chorus, where they lead both choruses. Nayeon, Jihyo, Momo, and Dahyun all have a portion in the second chorus, which was extended. Instead of having 3 choruses (Verse - chorus - verse - chorus - bridge - chorus) they had (verse - chorus - verse - chorus - repeated chorus with different members - verse). 

**Likey: Jihyo, Sana, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung.** Again, this is a much different chorus (for title tracks): it is the first without Nayeon, the first with Chaeyoung, the first to start a song with the chorus, and it's the first to not change at any of it's 3 stages. Sana intros, Dahyun interludes, Jihyo repeats Sana's part, then Chaeyoung repeat Dahyun's. 

**Heart Shaker: Nayeon, Jihyo, Tzuyu, (is) Sana (gay), and Jeongyeon.** THE MOST ICONIC CHORUS OF ALL TIME. Similar to Likey, this chorus stays the same through all 3 parts, in terms of who sings what, with the exception that Jeongyeon adlibs during the final chorus. I'm counting this as part of the chorus, even though it's not actually part of EACH chorus. Nayeon asks innocently if Sana is gay, Tzuyu's ""you're my heart shaker, shaker"", Sana cutely gay-attacks the members, Nayeon goes again, then Jihyo finishes up. Repeat this three times. Absolutely legendary. We stan gays so confident they call out members in their own songs. 

**What is Love?: Sana, Tzuyu, and Nayeon.** Alright, this one is tricky, but I'm including Nayeon because I included Jeongyeon above. This is the first song where the chorus doesn't include Jihyo, and also the first chorus since Like Ooh-Ahh where it's just two members with no interjections from other members. Sana and Tzuyu sing the first two choruses, and then their lyrics are removed from the final ""chorus"", where the ""I wanna know"" and ""What is Love?"" shouts are present, and Nayeon is adlibbing over those shouts. 

**Dance the Night Away: Everyone but Sana and Tzuyu.** Another interesting chorus, as it sort of switches each time. The first chorus has Chaeyoung with the two ""let's dance the night away"", and Jihyo singing the lines in between. The first chorus (I would allow the argument that this isn't technically part of the chorus, but I personally think that the chorus doesn't end until Sana's part starts) has a part after Jihyo's lines with Dahyun and Chaeyoung's little ""dance the night away"" shouts. In the second chorus, Momo sings Chaeyoung's part from the first and Jeongyeon sings Jihyo's. In the final chorus, Mina sings the small interludes and Jihyo takes back her part from the beginning, while her and Nayeon take turns with adlibs. 

**Yes or Yes: Everyone but Mina**. Don't worry Mina stans, as you know; she still got her lines. This was definitely their busiest and longest chorus of their title tracks. It has a unique trait in which it has all of the members in EACH chorus, as opposed to the choruses switching. Chaeyoung and Sana mirror their individual ""yes or yes"" lines, Jeongyeon has her lines in between the Momo and Dahyun parts, Tzuyu's ""it's all up to you"", and then Nayeon and Jihyo sing the main vocalization of the hook. In the last chorus, Nayeon adlibs during Jihyo's parts, and Jihyo during Nayeon (and Tzuyu's) parts, and Sana even has her own little adlib (though it's more spoken than sung) toward the very beginning of the final chorus.

**TOTAL COUNT**

**Nayeon &amp; Jihyo: 9.** No member was in all ten choruses (Nayeon missed Likey, Jihyo missed What is Love?)

**Jeongyeon: 7**

**Sana: 6**

**Dahyun: 5**

**Tzuyu &amp; Momo: 4**

**Mina &amp; Chaeyoung: 3**

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do those members sing the chorus**

So, besides Jihyo and Nayeon, why (do I think) the other members get parts in the chorus? Jeongyeon's is fairly easy; if you look at her parts in the chorus, almost ALL of her parts are taking over Jihyo or Nayeon's portion while they adlib. She's sort of a ""stand-in"" for them in terms of when she sings, although she does get her own unique portion in Yes or Yes and has her own adlibs in Heart Shaker. I think Mina is in few choruses because her voice is a bit softer and smoother, and lots of their choruses are pretty powerful. She makes up for this, however, by doing a majority of the pre-choruses or bridges in many of their songs. 

The other members primarily get smaller parts within the chorus, but I still think they're very important (not including Sana and Tzuyu who led two choruses). The ""jjirit jjirit"" in Signal, ""Let's Dance the Night Away"", Dahyun's part in TT and Yes or Yes, and all of those other parts may be small in terms of ""line percentage"", but their usually the most memorable parts of the chorus or even the whole song**. I think it's important not to look too much into how many lines the members get, but what lines they get; quality over quantity. I've said this before in line distribution posts and it also applies here: WHAT a member sings is a far better quality compared to HOW MUCH they sing.** This isn't a jab at Nayeon and Jihyo (who sing alot), nor a huge shout out to Momo and Dahyun (who don't). This is merely saying that the members, who get however many lines they get, it's more important to see where they come from. I always use this: Sana's ""Shy shy shy"" in Cheer Up is still, to this day, arguably their most recognizable line in ANY of their songs (to the general public), and it's about 3 seconds long in a song that came out almost 3 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does the chorus line up with the song/concept (+ overall review, sort of)**

Honestly I feel like all of the choruses actually do a really good job at sticking with the overall feeling and message from the rest of the song. With the exception of Yes or Yes (to some people), none of the choruses really feel particularly messy or elongated (or too short). The lyrics themselves also fit well, providing additional context or emotion to the song. While the most lyrically empty of the choruses, even Likey's repitition sends a unique message to the audience; no one cares what they have to say because their too focused on just ""liking"" everything (am I reading too much into this? Someone mentioned this and honestly I think it's extremely clever on their part if the theory is true). 

I also feel like the adlibs have improved alot. Not a knock on her voice, but more so how she was told to use it; I feel like in LOA, Cheer Up, and TT, Jihyo's adlibs in the final chorus were slightly overpowering during live performances and could make the chorus itself hard to hear. The notes themselves that she sings sound very good, but the actual strength behind her voice and those notes could make her sound disconnected from the rest of the song by being so strong. In some of the later songs, like in Knock Knock, both her and the producers really did an excellent job at toning down the strength of the note and focused more on the tone of the note; which fits in beautifully. It's recognizable, but it's not too strong and sounds almost soothing within the chorus. Jeongyeon's in Heart Shaker has a similar effect. Nayeon in What is Love? has lots of power in her adlibs, but it's done outside of the actual lyrics in the chorus; instead it's done alongside the background shouting, which makes the vocals feel more connected to each other. 

Similarly, Nayeon and Jihyo trading off in DTNA and Yes or Yes is done gorgeously. DTNA has some slight overlap with them almost ""battling"" for control, without actually overpowering each other or the beat. Yes or Yes has some soft falsetto notes and some lowered power-tones that really give the ending a more full and robust vocal that add in an excellent effect, especially paired with Nayeon's line which is completely hollowed out. Sort of like a beat drop, but done with their voices AND the beat. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some overall ""fun facts"" about each chorus**

These are just some cool parallels I found while reviewing the choruses, some of which may not necessarily come as a surprise. 

1. Jihyo &amp; Nayeon are the most common pair within a chorus, and every song had atleast one of them singing in the chorus; no song featured neither Jihyo nor Nayeon in atleast one of the choruses. 
2. 5 of Jeongyeon's 7 total chorus appearances are her ""taking over"" Jihyo's or Nayeon's part, usually in the final chorus. You could even argue that it's 6 of her 7, as in Heart Shaker she does the adlibs instead of Jihyo or Nayeon. Yes or Yes is the only song where she gets 100% uniqueness to what she sings in the chorus.
3. While generally viewed as the weaker singers (note: weakER, not weak) of the full vocal line (in other words: not including Momo and Dahyun), Sana and Tzuyu are the second most common pairing for choruses. I think this is because their voices play really well off of each other; they're usually in the choruses that aren't quite as powerful, Sana's is usually a couple steps higher than Tzuyu's, giving them a nice uniqueness while still keeping sharing a smooth, soothing quality. 
4. (Personal opinion) Dahyun's parts in the TT and Yes or Yes choruses are my favorite part of each of those choruses. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you guys think and how you feel about the choruses, and maybe if I missed something or have something wrong. I'll likely do another post like this going over their Japanese tracks, and in the future I'd like to do one about pre-choruses/bridges in their title tracks. ",18,91

For the past couple of weeks now, the number of monthly listeners for TWICE has dropped down to a number lower than the amount of followers they have. Before, the number of monthly listeners appeared greater than the amount of followers by 50k, and at one point, 100k+. It sort of pains me to see these numbers drop, which is why I am posting about this to make ONCE aware. If ONCE can help stream our favorite girls on Spotify, as well as on YouTube, that would make me feel 100x better as we should do our best to support our girls as they have done basically everything to make us happy.",42,38

On 22 February 2018, the [BRAND NEW GIRLMusic Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1CMjQ0QJ1E) was released! This was the group's third Japanese MV release, after One More Time and Candy Pop.

Moreover, on 28 February 2018, the Twicetagram Monograph was released! This was the group's first full album monograph and their fourth monograph in all, after Page Two, Twicecoaster, and Signal.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from these eras or just discuss these eras in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* What are your thoughts on Brand New Girl in general? How does the song fit into Twice's overall style?
* If you discovered Twice at or before these eras, how has your opinion of the group evolved since then?
* What was your favorite lyrics from this song? Which lines stand out to you? What are your favorite scenes from the MV?
* Among every Twice monograph to date, which are your favorites?

I know theres been JYP docs circulating the net sayin they will be coming sometime during 2019, but does anyone know or have a strong inkling about what month it could be?

[General Question]: I just wanted to run this by the community. i just wanted to know, How much does a signed Twice Mwave Album go for, and or How much is too much when it comes to buying signed albums? 

[My Situation]: Recently came across some Twice merch that looked appealing, but im not quite sure what to get for my first piece of memorabilia. seeing how buying more than one thing will literally make me BROKE! Ive decided to let whoever comes across to decide for me, and decide whats a good deal...
[Oh on a side note]: Im partial to the Signed Album because lets be honest, ill probably never be lucky enough to get something signed from them anyways 

[Whats worth the price? (budget: 120$) *Optional*]

[A]: TWICEcoaster Lane 1 M-Wave polaroid-style photocards = 40$

[B]: TWICE x Beanpole Sport poster = 15$

[C]: The Story Begins (M-Wave signed by all members) = 100$

[D]:  ONCE Halloween Transparent Film = 15$ (whole set)

[E]: ONCE Halloween Postcard = 30$ (whole set)

[F]: Get something from next merch drop *Twice2 and Onward* 

[G]: Use your money on something useful 

[Thanks for your help!~Y.H]

Feeling a bit uninspired? **What about a theme for your creations?** As the Taemin - Move cover from HK Music Bank aired last week, how about a piece inspired by a cover Twice has done in the past? Are there any more covers you would like to see Twice do in the future?

964,2019-2-28,2019,2,28,11,avlx6t,What would you do with a TWICE song?,Drocar75,1551322047,"You are given the chance to produce a TWICE song to exactly you're liking, start to finish; let's just assume for the fun of things that you have these abilities. You can choose to write it yourself and a topic, or relinquish it to one of the members. You get to pick who gets which lines, the concept of the song, the music video, everything. What kind of song would you give them? This is just meant for fun, I think it'd be interesting to see how many people differ (or don't) in what they'd like to do/see. It's assumed that all of this stuff is decided by you, even if in a normal scenario it wouldn't happen. ""But Dro, they wouldn't ask me"" ""But Dro, they wouldn't have the producer choose who writes the song"" is negativity that is unneeded in the comments; in this what if scenario, it all happens. By you. Have a blast.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first off, I would have Chaeyoung and Jihyo write the song. Personally I think that lyrically, Chaeyoung's songwriting is phenomenal. While the songs she wrote are, as songs, not my favorites, I love the lyrics. Jihyo is probably second. Plus, both of them have the most experience writing songs for the group and I think they'd do great a conveying a type of message they all want to get across. Having the members write it makes it feel more sincere in a recording, but maybe that's just me.

In this perfect fantasy world setting, Jihyo would write the chorus and bridge, while Chaeyoung would write the verses and a rap break. Though I'm sure they'd help each other. 

Next; the song itself. If I had the chance, I think I would make them do a step further from Yes or Yes. I love their bubblegum pop, but I do agree that a SLIGHT change in concept would be nice, and the members have stated that they'd like to start maturing their songs as they mature themselves. So, something that's still an upbeat pop song, but has a slightly... darker? feel. Not quite sexy, not quite girl crush, but also not quite ""cutesy"" or bubblegum. Something in a healthy middle. 

How to distribute the lines: Alright, this is going to be the one where people start throwing. Everyone deserves lines, everyone deserves their time to shine. So, even though line distributions are largely irrelevant to the impact of the song, this is how the line distribution order would look (I'll go in depth as to who would get what): Jihyo &gt; Nayeon &gt; Jeongyeon &gt; Chaeyoung = Mina &gt; Sana = Tzuyu &gt; Dahyun &gt; Momo

Jihyo's lines: Chorus, bridge, adlibs in final chorus

Nayeon's: Chorus, introduction line, bridge

Jeongyeon's: First and second verses, Jihyo's part in the final chorus (while Jihyo does adlibs)

Chaeyoung's: Half of a full rap verse (think Precious Love or Do It Again) and some small lines throughout (think Heart Shaker? first thing that came to mind)

Mina: Pre-chorus and bridge

Sana: First verse, pre-chorus

Tzuyu: Second verse, pre-chorus

Momo: The killing part of the song in the pre-chorus (pretty much exactly like her lines in Cheer Up or Likey)

Dahyun: Second part of rap verse 

**There would be a bit of overlap,** but this is where a **majority** of their lines would be. It'd take a long time for me to go ""First line... Second line..."" etc. so I'm just sticking with the above format

The music video: Honestly I would love another Heart Shaker-style music video, where the whole MV is basically them doing the choreography, but still with the feeling of a music video (as opposed to a performance video). Or something on the ""simpler"" side like Likey. Nothing super flashy or CG heavy, but still easy on the eyes and lots of interesting camerawork.

In my perfect world, I would love to hear another Momo rap song, but only because I think her voice doesn't suit the cuter concepts. In this particular scenario, when they're doing a slightly more mature song with a lower tone, Momo's natural voice would fit this better and thus I'd relinquish singing the catchy part of the song to her. A nice mixture of her cuter voice and her comfortable voice. So, for the purpose; assume that Dahyun's and Momo's parts above are interchangeable and I am happy either way.

I made a compilation of some of the sales, awards, and other achievements TWICE has earned during the month of February, or for songs released in the month of February. Sources I used to help are at the bottom of the post. If I missed anything, let me know and I'll make an edit!

&amp;#x200B;

**Album releases:**

One Korean album, TWICECoaster Lane 2 (TCL2), on February 20, 2017. It was a repackaging of ""TWICECoaster Lane 1"", which featured all of those songs, plus their title track ""Knock Knock"" and ballad B-side ""Melting""/""Ice Cream""

One Japanese release, the Candy Pop CD (Note: The song was pre-released as a digital single alongside the MV in January, but the CD with its sister track ""Brand New Girl"" were released on February 7th).

&amp;#x200B;

**Sales Achievements (Korea):**

In all years combined since release, on GAON, they've sold a total of 311,133 physical albums in the month of February. 290k of those came in 2017, during their release of TCL2. 266k of those 290k were strictly from TCL2.

TCL2 is their 6th best selling album of all-time, not even 1,000 copies ahead of Summer Nights. 

TCL2 is the 4th highest selling album in the first week of its release, according to Hanteo, with 113,600 (rounded) copies sold. The three albums in front of it? All TWICE albums (in order) from first to third; twicetagram (129.7k), Yes or Yes (118.3k), and Signal (114.2k).

NOTE: Oricon sales are not included above. 

**NOTE 2: Hanteo sales will always be much lower than GAON sales, as they are tracked differently. So, this is why their first week sales (2/20-2/27) on Hanteo are barely 113.6k, but their first month sales (which, would only be an extra day from their first week) on GAON are over 265k.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Sales Achievements (Japan):**

Candy Pop is TWICE's second best selling Japanese CD with just over 341,000 sales. The exact number is tricky (Oricon counts by weeks instead of months, so there are some overlap days), however:

[This article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1123471wpp/twices-candy-pop-certified-platinum-japan-less-week-sales) this article states that it was certified platinum by the RIAJ (250,000 copies) after only FIVE days. [This one](https://www.soompi.com/article/1130417wpp/twice-surpasses-300000-sales-japan-first-time-ever-candy-pop) states that they pushed up to 311k by February 23rd. 

NOTE: Oricon's number (311k) is different from the order numbers (402k) in this article. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Knock Knock numbers and awards:**

While this didn't technically occur in February, TWICE won ""Song of the Year - February"" (song of the month but worded strangely) with ""Knock Knock"" at the 7th Gaon Chart Music Awards. It also won ""Best Dance Song (Female)"" at the MelOn Music Awards.

Knock Knock won nine music show awards; though none of them happened in February.

**As of now, the numbers are:**

1.6+ million downloads, 100+ million streams, 220+ million views, and 389+ million digital points (I'm not entirely sure how this number is calculated. GAON is strange)

69 total PAK hours (The only song by an idol group, boy or girl, to receive a PAK in 2017)

Most viewed MV in South Korea in 2017

&amp;#x200B;

**Candy Pop/Brand New Girl numbers and awards:**

""Candy Pop"" (just recently) won ""Song of the Year by Download"" at the 33rd Japan Gold Disc Awards. 

""Candy Pop"" currently sits at 96.7M views on YouTube. The second highest viewed Japanese M/V by a K-Pop girl group. 

""Brand New Girl"" has literally thousands below 25M. 

I wasn't able to find a reliable number for the streaming/downloads/etc. like I could for Knock Knock. If anyone has a link to something with this, that'd be fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you guys feel if I did this every month? There are some months (like March) where they really haven't done anything, but April and May both featured multiple releases over the years that could be worth nothing.
