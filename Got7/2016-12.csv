10,2016-12-12,2016,12,12,15,5hv1v5,What is your favorite song from each album?,Infinitize-It,1481522653,"This topic was posted in r/infinite7, and I had fun looking back and revisiting their older releases, so I figured I would bring it here too. Thanks to u/LemonJongie23 for the idea!

**Korean Releases**

* Got It? - I Like You and Like Oh (I really tried to pick only one, but I just couldn't)
* Got Love - Forever Young
* Identify - Magnetic
* Just Right - Nice
* Mad+Mad Winter Edition - If You Do
* Flight Log: Departure - Can't
* Flight Log: Turbulence - Who's That

**Japanese Releases**

* Yo Moriagatteyo - So Lucky, Jibberish (Again, I couldn't pick just one)
* Hey Yah - Let Me Know

Honorable mentions: A, Moonlight, Gimme, See the Light, and Mayday

I combined the Mad and Mad repackage and I also combined all of the Japanese singles into Yo Moriagatteyo because there were only 3 new songs in the repackage and 2 songs in each Japanese single, but if you would like to separate them, go ahead! There are no strict rules (I definitely cheated by choosing 2 songs for some albums), so just have fun with it and hopefully you'll rediscover some old favorites like I did with Like Oh!
