Happy 4th Anniversary! Today in Korea it is again the same day where 4 years ago, these 7 guys we adore were introduced officially to the world and debuted as GOT7. 

Last year I decided that I wanted to do something for the community and, as an ahgase who happens to be a graphic designer (or a graphic designer who happens to be an ahgase most of the time :P), I couldnt think of a better way than doing something that puts my own abilities to use. 

And now I bring to you the result of a couple of months of hard work: a new customized theme, especially for this subreddit and for GOT7! With this theme, I hope to *bring in more fans to engage* with the community, and also *inspire everyone to collaborate* so that this place can become an **active and resourceful place for all Ahgases**.

#NEW FEATURES

##HEADER    
* The header is a living thing now! On the top right you can find links to Official GOT7 accounts in some of the most used SNS platforms. On the top left you can play around with the logos and see what happens ; )

##USER FLAIRS    
* The other mods and I agreed that GOToons would make adorable user flairs! And so, on the side bar you can now pick one of the seven members or the got7 logo, and write your own text: it will appear when the mouse hovers over the flair. We might include more in the future and make polls to decide what you want to see, but it should be adorableness enough for now :D

## MENU BAR    
* Now we have a Menu that is on top of every page, you can find useful links there and more things will come in the future!

&amp;nbsp;    

# WHAT IS COMING IN THE FUTURE

## COMMUNITY RULES AND UPDATES    
* We want the sub to be better organized, more active and to be an useful place for future reference and search. For this reason, the other mods and I are working on re-writing the rules, title formatting and flair system. 

## SEARCH BY FLAIR
* In the future, youll have easy access to searches that automatically filter everything under a flair, so all youll need to worry about is picking the keywords :)

&amp;nbsp;    

These changes and the things coming in the future are just our own ideas and work, but this community wouldn't exist without the readers and subscribers. **If you have any ideas about how we can improve, or even if you want to help somehow.** Maybe you like to write and want to help with wiki pages, or maybe you already have a list of JJ Project book recommendations and arent sure how to post? Maybe you're not sure if you should post anything at all?! Feel always free to message the mod team and well help you out (or maybe youll help us!)

&amp;nbsp;    

I don't want this to be too long, so that's everything for now!     
Thank you for being here! And hope you'll have a great week :)
