I just moved to Korea and so I want to try for one. I know there's no guarantees, but I'd like to hear some numbers of how many CDs you or someone you know had bought (even if they didn't get in). Of course I understand many people like to keep it a bit of a secret so you could PM if you want. 

&amp;#x200B;

And for music shows, I've read on fans the past requirements and all, but it would be helpful to hear personal experiences.",5,12

Do they normally sell out within minutes or do I not have to worry about that? BTS ticket purchasing was a shit show but when I bought tickets long ago for SM Town it didnt seem that horrible...

So I really want to go to one of the concert for this world tour and the closest one for me is Australia (I live in NZ). However, I also want to take my lil sister with me, but she lives in Indonesia. 
So I kind of thinking of taking the risk to wait, in case they decide to add Singapore or Malaysia or Thailand, or even Jakarta for this world tour and just go there since it's most likely gonna be cheaper. Also, I feel like the probability of them not going to Thailand (at least) is pretty low. 
What do you guys think? We could both go to Australia, its not a problem, but if we could minimise the expense, then why not.

Ive gotten into Got7 the past last 5 months the deeper I get the more I see all the variety shows and wild stuff Jackson did to promote his group on these shows. Im curious do you all think Got7 would be as popular as they are now w/o Jackson/ Jacksons personality? The only reason I know of them is because of Jackson then I fell in love with everyone else. JB is my freaking bias and Im convinced hes the mom and Jinyoung is the dad and not the other way around thoughts?",13,10
