You know rice, soy sauce, ramen whatever but as we were going into the shop i saw this huge poster. I thought to myself hey that guy looks like jackson from got7. I don't actually stan got7, mostly txt and bts, so i didn't know for sure that it was him. I wanted to tell my sister who also likes k-pop but doesn't stan them that i thought it looked like jackson but then i was like no, she'll probably say it looks nothing like him. So i carried on walking but then i realised that right next next to his face it said jackson wang. I shouted my oh my gosh it's jackson and my mum and sister were like who? and i was like from got7! Then we both got super excited even though we don' actually stan them so ummm yeah and sorry if i offended you by not stanning them but their music just isn't my type",0,0

Im pretty sure Marks family is from Taiwan but Mark himself is from LA. Jackson is obviously from China (Hong Kong) but they speak Cantonese in HK so does his Mandarin have a Cantonese accent? Jackson says he is only alright but I feel hes just being humble (because he is!) His Cantonese is obviously perfect and my mom can confirm because she is Cantonese and shes seen of Jacksons HK interviews. Thanks guys!  ,3,22
8,2019-9-5,2019,9,5,15,czx023,I need advice regarding the European tour,shouldreflectme,1567664440,"Hi! I'm planning on going to the London concert on the 11th of October, however, I'd be flying from Hungary and I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands because of that. WizzAir is offering really cheap flight prices to London right now, and I don't know how long those offers are going to last, but I'm afraid that they will get much more expensive by next Wednesday, when ticket sales are on. Normally I would wait until I have my concert tickets to book a flight, but I couldn't afford to spend double on flight tickets, as the concert tickets themselves already turned out to be more expensive than I anticipated (I'm still a student and only work part-time). Also, I have used AXS before and I absolutely hated it, and I'm scared that I might not get tickets after all, so even getting the cheap flight would be money thrown out the window.

What would you do in my place? Should I book the flight regardless? Do you think I can definitely get tickets? I mean, I could even get BTS tickets this year (to Paris, though), but I'm still undecisive. I don't know how big the GOT7 London fanbase is, plus as far as I know this will be their first time in London. I'm sorry if this is a stupid post, but I really don't know who to ask :(",8,10

I was wondering if any of you tried to MBTI type our guys?   
I know they took the test back in '16, but honestly, I think most of the results are wrong.   
First thing, Jinyoung strikes me as a obvious INFJ. And BB as ESFP. I have no concrete evidence, but I think most of them were misstyped. I did a typing of my own back when they did the test on HC and I lost the paper :') Only thing I remember is that none of it corresponded to their results :')",10,12

TAKE A BOW fansite had a cute cup sleeve event for Jinyoungs birthday this weekend! The whole cafe was decked out in photos of Jinyoung taken by TAB, and it was such a cute little gallery style mini exhibition. 

On all the drinks, you had the option to pick a photo of Jinyoung that they printed directly on the foam top of the drink!! I chose the one of him with the puppy :) They also had printed macarons with art from @abimabima and those were sooo cute as well! 

In a small room inside the cafe, TAB had a whole set up of their past photobooks of Jinyoung for fans to flip through, as well as cute little merch items theyve made in the past! Theres a screen in the room and they were playing a really sweet video they made; part of it was a really cute song over some clips of Jinyoung smiling and waving at fans, and then the rest was a really lovely compilation of fancams of their performances from every single era in order starting at JJ Project (my heart!! ) all the way up to the Hey Guys fansign that was last weekend.

It was such a cute experience and there are a lot of cute gifts the fansite prepared like a beautiful handfan, photo cards, stickers, and a pamphlet!! 

Thats all! In case anyone biases Jinyoung but couldnt be here, I wanted to post some photos and the experience for you all to read ^^
