Someone close to the stage in front of them yelled something, and then BamBam and then Mark and then Jackson each asked her what she said, then Mark said ""I'm not going to repeat that"" and BamBam said the crowd was savage. 

I'm not the only one dying of curiosity right? So who here was in her section and heard what she said? I'm dying to know!!!",2,6

Since GOT7's 3rd (full) album is coming soon, I really want to help them top the charts for this come back. As the charts are a combination of online streaming and offline sales, I'm willing to help us overseas ahgase who have trouble to getting a melon account for streaming. My idea is to collect funds and buy as much as possible melon accounts, then distribute them to whoever have time to stream (there are plenty tutorials about how to stream); however it might not be the best idea since there are many issues that come along. 

Also I know that all the Chinese fan sites have opened the link to collect funds for ''non-return albums'', as you will only receive the photo cards instead of the album. It's the solution for topping the sales while you don't get an overload of the same album and have no storage place. But I haven't seen something similar overseas. 

What do you guys think? ( I don't know if it's appropriate to post like this. If not, please let me know) And comment below and let me know what do you think:) &lt;3 love&amp;peace",3,10
