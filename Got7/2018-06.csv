10,2018-6-11,2018,6,11,21,8q9bul,Paris was amazing!!,xisaaa,1528721918,"Oh god. I had the experience of my life yesterday. The boys were amazing and that made up for the organisation being terrible. They are all so handsome!! 

The hi touch blew me away because I did not have any preparation, it was so sudden. The order was Mark, Jinyoung, JB, Youngjae, Jackson, Bambam, Yugyeom. The most memorable ones for me were Jackson who grabbed my hand ahshdhdh, JB who said the cutest hellooo~ ever and Yugyeom who gave me the cutest smile ever. I am so happy I can remember the moment I had with all!!

Now, for the organization, we had to get a wristband at noon to get a number. Then we had to comeback at 3 to get in line for the hi touch. We were dying in the heat for 2 hours before we got into the venue. After the hi touch we had to sit at our spots in the pit to create space, everyone was pushing regardless though. I dont think it was a good decision to not have a barrier between VIP and A :( It was so crowded that a lot of people fainted.

However, I went with it and screamed my lungs out every song. During Paradise I got Jackson to notice me again, we made eye contact and I blew him a kiss!! They put up an amazing show even though it was so hot. Cant wait till they are back!!",9,20

(Ive been thinking about this for like a week now, and I was like but it has only been a couple of months since 2018 has started, so if I wait patiently I moght see some cute interactions then I realized its already june) I know that Jinson is waaay more popular these days, but did Markson really fall out this hard? Did something happen beetween them?
