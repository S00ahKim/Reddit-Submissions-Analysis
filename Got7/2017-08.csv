Special Note: So far, every night since their comeback, JB and Jinyoung have been alternating doing live V apps. However, there is no set time for these, nor are they something that will definitely happen every night, so I will not put them on the schedule. Also, JYPe has also been releasing ""JJ Diary The Moments"" every night at 7pm KST on Youtube, but again, there is no guarantee that they will happen every day, so they will not go on the schedule.
