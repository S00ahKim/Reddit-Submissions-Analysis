I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Japan for my birthday! It just so happens that Got7 is also holding a concert at Kobe World Hall nearby. I am thinking of purchasing my tickets either from viagogo or stubhub. The tickets on both website say reserved which I am assuming is just a seat.

Which would be a safer choice?

Also how long before the concert should I line up?

Are there any other tips and advice you can give me?

What kind of things should I bring?

Thank you so much in advance! ",4,1

The paper was for Business Communication (I study Communication in Italy), and it follows the stakeholder relationship management methodology. You can totally skip the first part, it was just an intro on kpop (it still has some interesting info tho) for my prof, who I don't think knows anything about it lmao.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to have any feedback really! If you see mistakes in english it's because it's not my first language and I've never really studied how to write in academic english, tbh this was my first paper ever!
