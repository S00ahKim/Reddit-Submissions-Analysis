Either the regular one or the keychain (preferred tbh because then I can hang it on my bag), but based on my googling I think those may have been limited edition? 

I live in Canada so if it's online they will need to ship here. Also, I am flying to Hong Kong and will also be in Japan in the next couple weeks, if that helps. Not sure if they're sold in physical stores at all. 


Thanks! :) ",2,3
