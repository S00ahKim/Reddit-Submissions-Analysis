Due to ~~lukewarm~~ [overwhelming demand](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4imsnd/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_a_fan/), I've created a new sub to post fan service &amp; skinship content.

On the day of the sale, I was hoping for NYC tickets but their site was soooo slow so I got scared and purchased ATL as a backup. I did end up with better seats in NYC so now I'm looking to get rid of the ATL tickets ASAP. I'm selling them for their exact price plus the insurance price, so $257.13 (These are the $120 tickets). Message me or comment if you're interested.",4,1

Does anyone know if the light sticks on ebay are legit, as weird as that sounds? I know kpoptown just put up pre-orders for them but they wouldn't be released until June 27 and I don't want to pay $40 for ems on top of the $30 the stick already costs. Googling around I havent even been able to find pics of the stick that aren't official or got7 holding them either.",2,1
