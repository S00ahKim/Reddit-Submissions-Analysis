So I picked up some nice blank shirts from Uniqlo today and I've been thinking about putting some subtle Got7 meme references on them. But I can't decide on [which to do](https://imgur.com/a/YoCMR6E). These would be for personal use but I'd love to hear input/suggestions!

Right now I have   

- ""Dandelonie"" as fake Supreme shirt.  

- ""Chu Chu Chu Chuuuuuuu"" in Black on white  

- ""Chu Chu Chu Chuuuuuuu"" in white on white (I really love doing monochrome designs, the materials I use have a slight shine against matte t-shirts that looks luxe)  

- The last one is lyrics from Thank You, one of my current fav Got7 songs. I will for sure do this one but in black on black. The back will have the continuation of the line ""So I'm so sorry"" but offset.

  
So yeah, dandelonie or chu chu chuuu? Or is there another great Got7 moment I should design for? What's your favorite meme?",2,4
