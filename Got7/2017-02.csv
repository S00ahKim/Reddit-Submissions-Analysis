5,2017-2-7,2017,2,7,5,5sgqw0,"New fan, but I'm incredibly impressed with these guys",Ohmstar,1486413440,"I'm a fairly casual K-Pop fan. Most of the time, I tend to like just a few singles from artists. I rarely ever find myself diving into a K-Pop artist/group's entire discography. The only groups I've loved entire albums from have been 2ne1 and Wonder Girls (imagine my dismay that they both disbanded recently).

I first came across Got7 about 4-5 months ago. Since then I've watched all of their videos on repeat, quite a few live performances, and some other random videos. It wasn't until very recently that I decided to buy one or two of their releases. I started with Got It? and Got Love. Excellent. Then I moved on.

Today, I've finally listened to every Got7 album, EP, and single that I am aware of, including the Japanese releases. Throughout the whole experience, there was never a dull track (okay, I'm not a huge fan of the song Hey Yah). I kept being entirely surprised by just how good all of these songs were. The guys are incredibly talented, and their music has shown a real sense of growth. 

I hope Got7 stays around for a very, very long time.

Just had to gush a bit. I'm now obsessed.",15,11
