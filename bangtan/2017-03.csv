Honestly, this all originally started from me looking for album art for Beautiful and stumbling across this person's blog:

http://getout0613.tistory.com/345

She pretty much has album art for almost every cover and Soundcloud song we could ever ask for. But she didn't have any for any of their more recent songs and I guess that's what sort of prompted me to make some of my own. I tried my best to follow her style so that all my album art would at least match. All of mine will come with my watermark but they're free to use. I'm Kookie biased so most of them are for the sake of his covers but if there's a song you would like album art to, I'm up for suggestions! I hope you guys like them!

We know that Rapmon got his name from [saying](http://bts-trans.tumblr.com/post/56148920646/interview-130722-cuvism-magazine) ""Rap Monster"" in a song and then it stuck with him ever since. We also know that he always freestyle rapped ""I'm rap monster so I rap nonstop"" in performances/interviews during BTS' early years. But is it true/has it been confirmed that he got his name from a San E song? In San E's [Rap Genius](https://genius.com/San-e-rap-genius-lyrics) (2009), the first verse has the lyric ""Call me Rap Monster, cause I rap nonstop"". I randomly stumbled on this sick San E song and was surprised when I heard ""rap monster"".

My second question is more of a guess actually. So ""Boy Meets Evil"" is one of the most iconic songs/performances on WINGS as we all know. ~~*wink hobi abs wink*~~ Was the inspiration for the song name possibly from ""Bad Meets Evil"", the name of a rapper duo Eminem is in? This correlation might be a coincidence but it doesn't seem totally unlikely to me. What do you think?",3,23

A few weeks ago, I met this girl who did some kind of study program in Korea and said she worked with Bighit as part of a trainee thing. She told me she got to meet the boys a few times, and how hardworking they are! It sounds so....just unbelievable, I guess, but there's pictures on her instagram. It's crazy to think that I'm one degree of separation from BTS.

Then, in my dystopian lit class, we read Omelas. I spent the whole class trying to act chill, but I was so happy!

And today, I passed by this Korea Music Association on my campus and I think I'm actually going to join them. A lot of them love BTS and they have weekly discussions about various topics, like debut songs and hiphop in kpop. And they go out for karaoke and korean food all the time, so it sounds like a great way to make friends who are also ARMYs.

Basically, my life seems to keep coming back to the boys. And I'm loving it. Do you guys have any similar stories? Have you met random ARMYs or found things in your everyday life that connect to BTS?",6,68

Then suddenly, I was attacked by J-Hope's Hobiness with his ""Hi~ I'm your hope~ You're my hope~ I'm J-Hope! Woo!"" that still haunts me to this day. His stage presence and hopefulness made it really hard to focus on any other members. 

Ever since then, it's been this slow process of J-Hope climbing up the ladder and working hard at pushing Suga off of his throne. His dancing, his attitude, his rapping, his passion. So I decided to co-bias them. But J-Hope wasn't having it.

First that outfit in their 4 million celebration V live, then him singing in Spring Day.

It got only worse when the man almost had me in tears with his stage at the WINGS Tour in Seoul. Now with the release of the Spring Day Dance Practice.... J-Hope is trying again.

How can I stop this madness?? It's a problem!

This is a game to determine the sub's favourite song. All you have to do is **vote for the song you like the least**. Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

**/!\** Before announcing last round's eliminated song I'd like to apologise for delaying a round again (this round was supposed to be posted yesterday)... this friday was especially busy so I really didn't have enough time. And since for me fridays in general tend to be really crazy, I am going to change the survivor schedule a little bit and instead of doing them every 48 hours, they will be done **every sunday, tuesday and thursday** starting next week. I know that because of this some rounds will be longer than others but I hope you all understand. This is the schedule that fits best with my school activities. Hopefully after this change there won't be any more delays!

So.. moving on to last round's results! *Tomorrow* was the eliminated song, with 26% of the votes, even though *BTS Cypher Pt. 3: Killer* was very close behind with 25%. Which song do you think is going out this time?

As always, please make sure you have heard all songs before voting.

Two, I found their music annoying. Three, they came out when EXO's debut album finally came out so I really had time for no one else.

So now that I am blinded by Wings love, obviously I have revisited the old stuff and I friggin LOVE ""We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2."" I still think the MV is hilarious and they are all babies, but man do I love that song. Same goes for ""No More Dream."" These two songs pander to my closet swag.  They're fun to let off some steam and dance to when I am... home alone...

I still can't get into ""N.O"" though, it may be my least favourite song by BTS along with """" (Satoori Rap). Otherwise BTS can't do wrong in my books :) I am going to LOSE. MY SHIT. if I hear the opening trinkets of ""Baepsae"" at the concerts this month!",107,58

You can get to the wiki at any time by going to: www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki  

Here are some of the sections of the wiki that I want to highlight for you all:  

#[Related Websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/websites)  

This gives links to some super useful websites, such as links to translators on various platforms (Youtube, Tumblr, Twitter, etc.), Twitters to follow to keep updated with BTS, and a few other cool things!  

If you see any cool websites missing that you think should be linked there, just edit the page and add them! Anyone with over 250 karma on this subreddit is able to edit the wiki!  

#[Audio](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/audio)  

I worked on this page a lot today; you can now find a list of all the different places you can legally stream BTS' albums on here, as well as other places to look for not officially released audio, the members' spotify playlists, and a list of collaborations BTS has done with other artists (you will almost certainly find a song you haven't heard before in here hehe). Again, if anything's missing, please add it!  

#[Member Fansites](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/fansites)  

I made a list of some of the most popular fansites for each of the members for you to follow here :)  

#[Eat Jin/Cooking Blogs Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/jin)  

Made a masterlist of Eat Jin episodes and Jin's old cooking blogs (10/10 would highly suggest reading cooking blogs - Jin is funny and sassy af in them, my personal fave is ""Jin makes food after a long time"" because he forgot to upload this blog for several months and then totally forgot everything he was going to say. So he just makes stuff up the entire time about the pictures lol)  

Also random aside but Season 2 of Eat Jin and Eat Jin on V App &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  

#[Hope on the Street Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/hopeonthestreet)  

List of all of J-Hope's dance practices! :D Including the ones from before it was called ""Hope on the Street"". Again, if any are missing, please add them~!  

#[Covers Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/covers)  

Boy this one was the most time-consuming of all. Or maybe it was the fansites list. Either way it took a while. But anyway, here is a list of all the song/dance covers the members have done (that I can find!) If any are missing, please add them!  

#Thread Archives  

I've made a few sections for thread archives on here because I think it would be nice to be able to refer to them later on. So far I've made:  

* [Record Masterposts archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/btsrecords)  
* [Hwarang Discussion posts archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/hwarang)  
* [WINGS Tour Megathread archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/wingstour)  

There's also a page for [BTS Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects), which lists all the BTS Projects-related threads that there have been if you ever need to refer back to any of them \^^  

That's all I've come here to announce! Click around the wiki some - there's even more cool stuff I haven't mentioned in this post! And if you want to make a new page of your own, you definitely can as long as you have over 250 karma on this subreddit.

When do the tickets usually go on sale? And what websites? 
I've been checking on Ticket Master everyday and no luck lol... I'm way to excited about this. 


I also told my boss about me going as I have to take time off and he was like ""you're taking time off to see a boy band?"" (I'm 26 lol) and I showed him some videos... I think it's safe to say he's an army now ^^LMAO",7,24
161,2017-3-8,2017,3,8,11,5y5f8k,SUGA birthday project - KAPS donation,BTSprojects,1488941853,"Hi guys!

We just wanted to remind you guys about the KAPS donation. Remember, this will be the ""gift"" accompanying the Yoongi birthday project. Donations will be open until **5:00 pm US CENTRAL time tomorrow (March 8th)**. Please be timely with your donation as we will be making the donation as soon as the deadline closes (5:00 pm USC on the 8th is roughly 8:00 am of the 9th KST).

&amp;nbsp;

We summarized KAPS' mission down below, but you can read more about the organization from their [Korean website](http://www.koreananimals.or.kr) or their [English FB page](https://www.facebook.com/KAPSAnimals).

KAPS is a Daegu-based animal shelter (they actually have 2 Daegu shelters) that has been open since 1989 and a non-prof since 1991. Their main goal is to rescue animals from the likes of abuse, meat trade and the dangers of the streets, while also raising awareness about animals to the youth and general public in Korea. They provide a safe home to all rescues as long as needed; that is, until they are adopted. However, due to the increase of animals, they can no longer take in more rescues. They are still looking for volunteers and donations in the form of pet food, money, toys, and other pet necessities.

Since we can't all travel and/or coordinate and international care package, we are going to do a money donation. You can donate whatever amount you feel comfortable with, we're not putting a minimum requirement for this one.

&amp;nbsp;

You can read the guidelines for donating [here](http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png), most importantly, **dont forget to add username / SUGA Project / preferred way to credit in the comment box** before sending your donation [to us](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs).

&amp;nbsp;

----------

&amp;nbsp;

Please, keep an eye out for this project's update post! The book is in Korea and now we're just waiting on the KAPS donation to finalize the project!

Thank you guys for participating! 

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely, 

The BTS Projects Team",9,66

211,2017-3-11,2017,3,11,5,5yolok,Reminder about behaviour during WINGS tour,Eren_,1489178760,"Hello, folks!

Just passing by today to remind everyone about some things to keep in mind during the tour. This isn't a policing post, just something to remember. I know the fans here are generally older and more respectful, but in the chance someone might try it...

##1. Please respect the members' personal space.

Trying to grab members is really [not cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZBfpQUAIms). Mobbing them is also bad and can result in [them falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioc9PJqi5hk).

##2. Please try not to scream, shout or run inside airports.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mPJNAZjh4) is highly disrespectful to people, and can be annoying for the members. 

##3. Don't be a stalker.

Please no sasaeng behaviour. No stalking near airports/hotels or renting a room close to theirs. If you find information about where they are staying or something close to that, please report and don't disseminate.

##4. Don't bother them during off-time.

Let them enjoy themselves. BTS members are people too.

##5. Don't ask them to sign stuff, accept gifts or take pictures.

They can't do that. Pressuring them into doing it is even worse, since they might get scolded.

##6. Don't be inappropriate.

Don't be [that one weird fan](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/268476752144236546/289536880645767179/GOT7JBJinyoungShirt.png). 

---

###Also, as another reminder:

There seems to be a scammer that is planning to sell goods at the venue during the U.S. tour. Please be wary of any merch that is not official.

---

That's all. [Enjoy your concert experience!](https://68.media.tumblr.com/7b94d3115f65ff59328db0635195ba52/tumblr_nbip9ln6Ng1tsy68po1_500.gif)",80,196

227,2017-3-12,2017,3,12,6,5yv0sp,170311 /r/bangtan rules + flair update post,dorkprincess,1489267655,"Hello again, /r/bangtan. It is us again, the mod team~  

Its been a couple months since we added our new mods, /u/llaverna and /u/juliancasablancas, and I think theyre doing a great job, as the sub hasnt exploded! *Wow!*  

Weve been working to clarify some rules and other things on the sub since then, and we wanted to inform you of some of the changes weve decided on, as well as ask for some feedback on a couple of changes.  

#Change no. 1: Clickbait  

New rule:  

&gt; Absolutely no links to allkpop or koreaboo articles are allowed. If a mod deems a link as looking similarly content-void or clickbait-y, it is also subject to removal. We will allow an article from one of these sites if they are legitimately the only source available (this is highly unlikely) if the article is copy/pasted into a self post rather than linking to the article directly.    

Allkpop and Koreaboo tend to be trashy websites that write some sleazy articles. We dont really want to support that kind of low-level journalism, so we would prefer to ban them outright. A good alternative news site to these places is Soompi.  

#Change no. 2: Self-promo posts   

&gt; Please try to abide by [Reddits rules on self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). If you arent sure, message the mods. We do not allow self-promotion of reaction videos; these MUST be submitted by someone else.   

If you want to promote something youve made on the sub, please take a look at [Reddits general guidelines on self-promotion posts first.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Please also make sure to message the mods if in doubt. We have decided to ban any self-promotion of reaction videos though; those **must** be submitted by someone else. If we find out that you are pretending to be someone else submitting your own links we will ban your account from the subreddit.   

#Suggestion: Humor/Crack/GIF posts    

We would like to know your opinion on humor/crack videos, GIFs, and posts. The mod team all agrees that we would personally prefer to have them moved to the /r/bangtan weekly room thread or ban them, but we know some people like this type of content, and we know people would like to have a variety of content even if not all of it is something they would personally like to see.  

The reason the mod team would prefer to limit these types of posts is because, while certainly not an issue right now, and with the sub growing as quickly as it is, these posts will most likely quickly become more of an issue and possibly start to drown other content (as we have personally observed in multiple other subs). The mod team also generally sees /r/bangtan as a place for slightly higher-quality content/discussions than other BTS boards, so we want to prevent the sub from becoming too spammy and low-quality with memes and shitposts ([though we do love our memes](https://i.imgur.com/kk3wXGl.png)).   

What would you like to be done with these kinds of submissions: removed completely, sent to the weekly thread, left how it is now, or do you have a different solution? Please let us know!  

#Flairs  

What type of post should use which flair is really confusing. We know. So weve been working tirelessly to re-categorize flairs and make them easier to understand. Our process had many emotional ups and downs, and can be summed up with [this image, pretty much.](http://i.imgur.com/SHzuZbQ.png)   

We have a list of the flairs we will now use along with an explanation for what content falls under which flair on [this wiki page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/flairs)

[Thanks for reading!](http://68.media.tumblr.com/3e8ffcbcbd5bb2a0726ede419db3a4c4/tumblr_ojd2llka7C1skako7o4_250.gif) And be sure to give us any feedback or ask us any questions you have about these rules, flair changes, and what to do with humor/crack/GIF posts below!  ",22,45

This is a game to determine the sub's favourite song. All you have to do is **vote for the song you like the least**. Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

Last round, *I Need U* was eliminated with 39% of the votes, even though * (Spring Day)* was super close with 38% - a 3 vote difference between them. And now, the final round of the ultimate survivor begins... ***Save ME*** vs *** (Spring Day)***: which one is going to win?

Annyeonghaseyo subscriber-deuls, /r/bangtan mod team imnida~   

In our last [rule update announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5yv0sp/170311_rbangtan_rules_flair_update_post/), we asked everyone what they thought we should do about humor/crack/meme/gif posts. The majority of people seemed to support moving these general humor posts into either the /r/bangtan room thread or its own weekly thread. Therefore, we have decided to test out having a weekly ""humor"" thread for a bit. If there isn't enough participation in the thread to warrant having a separate thread every week, we will then move all of the humor/crack/meme/gif posts into the /r/bangtan room thread.  

Now we would like your input into what, exactly, the title of this thread should be (and when it should be posted). Preferably, we don't want this weekly thread to be too close to the /r/bangtan room thread, so it'd be best to post it on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesdays. Here are a few of the names the mod team has come up with so far:  

* Wacky Wednesdays [XD](https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/840779397359652864)  
* Something with / (Weekly /r/heungtan room? ?)  
-please come up with something better involving this because translating this to ""Fun Boyz"" is just silly  

Please endorse one of these down below or suggest something better for us to use!",5,22

Not saying this is a requitrement or that they have to produce music without outside collaborators, but I think Wings proved how much they've grown musically and I don't think it's a stretch to say this is something BTS would like to do some day.

i think it'l be a fun activity to share 5 of your most favorite songs as a recommendation from and to your fellow ARMY. Don't be shy! We all love music here. It does not have to be BTS related, or kpop related, or even popular. It can be a soundtrack, a mixed song, in a different language, whatever you want. Just any music will be added if it's found on youtube.


 Suggest away and i'll add it! suggest at most, 5 songs, with the corresponding link and i'll see if i can add then :D

345,2017-3-19,2017,3,19,4,605s5p,Epilogue Concert Japan Edition,kakanucks,1489863995,"I was bored this morning, and I thought I'd check out the Epilogue Concert in Japan.

Wow.....I actually liked this one over the Seoul one...which I absolutely loved. The boys were killing it, the crowd was amazing, just the whole atmosphere was nuts, it felt like i was there too.

The set list was pretty much the same, except they sang Japanese versions of some of the songs. Which usually throws me off, but not this time. One thing I noticed was I think the boys limited down the hip thrusts in Baepsae lol. which made it really cute. I also preferred the white jacket during Save Me and Fire over the Red. (Namjoon showing off his arms in that sleeveless shirt after Fire during their ment)

But what really amazed me was the audience......wow I have to say J-armys are really something. They are really into the performance and I dun think I saw ONE cellphone during the whole concert. Usually it is really obvious when the Camera pans over the crowd and u can see the screens right away, but I seriously couldn't see one at all!!! That is a pet peeve of mine, everyone sticking up their cellphones trying to get pics or recordings, that it blocks the view of everyone. That they are so focused on getting the perfect shot that they are no longer even watching or enjoying the performance. UGH!!! 

I think my bucket list would be go to a concert in Seoul, then go to one in Japan. and finally hope to see the boys in my own country (which probably won't happen anytime soon).

So has anyone else watched this concert and want to share their thoughts??",7,16

However I was surprised since I have the Epilogue DVD and I have played it a lot of times without a problem even though I'm in Europe. I just found out a few minutes ago that on its info it doesn't include code 2 either. 

Now I don't really know how regions work since I don't really buy DVDs but does anyone know how come I can play it? I want to know if it was a lucky defect or if I'll be able to watch these DVDs as well :)

ps. I should probably include that I play the Epilogue on my laptop.

edit: thank you for all the help! :)",12,15

Not necessarily how much they make (that would be interesting though) but how long the term is most of all.
 Given it would end in like 2020, do you think they'd even keep going till having to join the millitary? I could see Rap Mon and Suga pursue solo careers as I feel like they're not 100% comfortable with their path of an idol, even though they obviously might not admit it.

i recently got the BEST OF BTS photos (both versions) and they're a lot bigger than i expected haha. but i'm not really sure how to display them in my collection.
since they're double-sided i especially wanted to put them in a display book but their awkward size (265 x 125 mm) makes it difficult to get something that they will fit well in?
i thought about grabbing an a3 display book (297 x 420 mm which would fit my posters that are 250 x 365 mm, though not ideally : ps if you have a suggestion for these i would love to hear as well!) but they would seem really weird with so much extra space around them and flop around in the lining. not really sure if there is a better alternative though since they are so long and tall.

thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!",6,9

I also have some vague memory of hobi mentioning that he wrote Jungkook's prechorus in Whalien 52 and he isn't listed for that song either. Does anyone know why?

My understanding is that Wings was inspired by Hesse's Demian.  I read this book several years ago, before I knew about BTS, and I was surprised to hear that there was a connection.  I see the way Abraxas appears in the Blood, Sweat and Tears MV, but beyond this, how is the album inspired by Demian?
When I read Demian, it was one of those rare moments in life when you read another person's words and think ""I am not alone in this world after all.""  I only just now discovered the connection, after watching BTS's own reaction video for BS&amp;T.  Namjoon says ""abraxas"" at one point, which blew my mind because, after all, you don't often see idols discuss gnosticism.  Do you know how the lyrics refer to the book?  
This is probably a really newbie question, but I am a BTS newb and seldom post on reddit, so please be gentle.  :c

Side-rant:

I have horrible luck.
&gt;I'm a guy who's into K-pop. 
&gt;Started learning Korean, just to enjoy it even more. 

&gt;Move out of the US for high-school. 


&gt;Find out BTS performing in IL, where I'll be going for uni this fall.



&gt;Really happy, cause they'll probably perform over there next year as well.

&gt;Realize that I'll be insanely broke freshman and most of sophomore year. 

&gt;Start hoping they perform over there 3-4 years later as well.

&gt;Realize they are 99.99% not going to perform any of the current songs.

&gt;Extremely Jealous.

&gt;Break down and cry.

&gt;Try to find some closure.

&gt;Watch all fancams of every live concert as soon as they're uploaded.

&gt;Watch all the MVs.

&gt;Buy a hoodie, key-chain and pillows.



Sorry if this breaks any rules. New to the subreddit and extremely heartbroken.",11,9

516,2017-3-25,2017,3,25,15,61ec5z,Info on Rainbow (&amp; Fire!) Ocean for U.S. Tour,OCesq,1490424293,"Hi, the rainbow ocean at the WINGS Tour shows in Newark have gotten a lot of love and it seems like many attendees didn't know it was coming or even that it was ARMY that organized it, just based on comments on various social media channels. I wanted to provide some more information about it, especially for attendees of upcoming shows and fans who are new to kpop culture. 


A rainbow ocean is a fan project used in many kpop concerts over the years, which utilizes colored bags over lightsticks, creating a multicolored gradient across the audience. The rainbow ocean for WINGS Tour has been planned at all three tour stops in the U.S. thanks to the dedication of fans crosscountry. There are many wonderful projects for each tour stop, but the ocean ones tend to the have the largest numbers, which is great because it requires a large amount of cooperation. The project was funded by donations and fundraising from the sale of fanmade merchandise. I'm not keeping track of the Chicago and Newark ones as much as Anaheim, but I know Anaheim raised about $2,000.00 to purchase 37,000 bags and other materials. 


**ANAHEIM**

- A Rainbow Ocean will appear on BOTH days, Saturday and Sunday, during Encore, Outro, all the way to the end of the show. Sunday's rainbow ocean will be unique in that letters BTS will be written in white in the middle of the ocean. 

- A FIRE OCEAN will be on Day 1, 4/1, Saturday exclusively. It will go up during... surprise, surprise, the song ""Fire."" :) I'm intensely excited for this one as it's a fun idea and appropriate for one of their most energetic main tracks. Mad kudos to whoever thought of this. It's going to be lit!

- This is organized by 10 fans on the [WINGS 2017 RAINBOW PROJECT IN ANAHEIM!!!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/218232255283647/?ref=group_browse_new) Facebook Group. Join to see the detailed color maps. 

- There are 120-150 day-of volunteers who will distribute colored bags inside the venues at the seated or standing sections themselves, and answer any questions about this. 

-  **More volunteers are needed.**The Facebook Groups updates their volunteer list every week and there are *entire sections* that do not have any volunteers at all. So that our boys don't see blocks of black in middle of the ocean, please take a look at the group's announcement posts and sign up on the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17aL6JNs7xP72str22fB7s56tf6a2rJuzbqf1RqTvFvA/viewform?edit_requested=true#response=ACYDBNgFkb6UXKM4V3g1emY3UHPJ2odFN7SM1vEKMeA6RDmFOBa_PErivwQ). All that's required is that volunteers show up before 5pm, and that they pass out bags in their section. I'm not an organizer, but I have plenty of details from them, so please ask me if you have questions about volunteering. 


**CHICAGO**

- The Chicago stop will have a rainbow ocean and it's being organized by 10 fans on the [BTS Wings Tour Chicago Rainbow ocean Project](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1840018912938241/permalink/1841537612786371/) Facebook Group

- Colored bags will be distributed both outside the venue and inside the venue. Fans picking up outside can help organizers by knowing their section number and taking a look at the color map before going, if possible. 

**NEWARK**

- Newark's shows are done, but it's worth mentioning because they had great success. The results speak for themselves. Great job east coast ARMY! [FACEBOOK GROUP HERE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/362296377474108/) 

- BigHit acknowledged it with two tweets for both days: [Here](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/845471320112480258) and [Here](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/845125361566343168)

1. Do you like certain fansite goods (slogans, dolls, photobooks, etc.) over others?
2. How much was your EMS? I know EMS differs according to the number of orders, but I'm just curious.

568,2017-3-27,2017,3,27,16,61qufp,Need opinions on bringing ver 1 lightstick,napmonsters,1490600822,"So I just saw this [tweet](https://twitter.com/yougotnojelli/status/846212610819145728) about the army bomb ver 1 not being allowed inside the venue for the show in Anaheim and I also messaged the venue myself to double check. Apparently only the ones being sold at the venue are allowed. Some people are saying to just bring it since they're sure security won't be able to tell the difference or won't confiscate so many who are bringing the older version. So I just want to know people's thoughts about this. Is it worth it to try and bring the older version and hope that it doesn't get taken away? 

Side note: Originally planned on getting ver 2 but bought ver 1 instead a couple of days ago and was going to bring it to the show this week.

UPDATE: [Honda Center](http://hondacenter.com/events/bts/) just updated their FAQ page and said that official BTS lightsticks (ver 1 and ver 2) are permitted. ",43,12

Sometimes I spend a lot of time seeing their things, and in social medias, that I neglect my own life. I have been seeing this with some friends, and I've been thinking this is kind a escape from reality.

Wow, it has been a pretty good week (and month) for the boys...and let's be honest, for us too ^(keep the selcas coming!). But, amid the tour, interviews, and near-daily photos we get of the boys, we wanted to take a quick moment to update you guys on the status of the Suga birthday project as the title of this post indicates.

Before we begin, we would like to take this moment to apologize for being radio silent these past couple of weeks. We had to attend some issues that came up as we were finishing up the Suga birthday project, which we will expand on further down below. 

So let's begin!

&amp;nbsp;

**Letter compilation**

We had **77 of participants** send in letters for the letter compilation! Thank you to all of you guys that trusted us and participated in the letter compilation.

The compilation was printed and ordered as a small softcover square book of about 18x18 cm ^(7x7 in), 54 pages thick, on premium matte paper...and we were able to get *some* of it translated! u/vanjs kindly volunteered as a translator for this project. The intro and most of the early letters sent in were translated by u/vanjs...with help from their mom. Yes! u/vanjs' mom also helped us a bit! So let's all them both a big round of applause and our most sincere thanks! Thank you u/vanjs for volunteering to do translations!!

We don't have a picture of the 'final product' due to the fact that the book was ordered and shipped directly to BigHit as soon as it was printed. However, [this is the template](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gmmCEpDyBcD--YXM) we used for accommodating the letters. If you're viewing the template as a PDF, you might miss [this feature](http://i.imgur.com/WQ1I5Pd.gif?1) at the bottom of the pages. If one flips through the pages quickly, the thumbnails look like Suga is playing the piano.

The template above is just that, a template. If you'd like to see how your submission was accommodated, PM us and we'd be glad to send you a picture of your entry!

Now, we did have a small issue with the book. The book was not delivered to BH after being cleared through customs because UPS Korea could not find BH listed in the building's directory. But fear not! Our lovely u/cryptographies coordiunnie/noona was able to resolve it quickly and the book [arrived on time](http://i.imgur.com/Gv9xm4Z.png?1)! However, in the future we will take preventive steps to avoid this happening again, so please be patient with us. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Donation**

Inspired by other fan donation projects, we decided to do a donation on behalf of Suga and his dog Holly as you might have already been aware. We were hoping to link a KAPS Facebook post that showed how the donation was to be credited, but that is not possible at this time (more on that later); so, for now we will show you guys how the donation was to be credited:

&gt; Date: *date March 2017*
&gt;
&gt; From: *Suga+Holly's fans at r/bangtan*
&gt;
&gt; *u/panic_fanatic27 / u/creamcheeseandbutter / u/yann_life / u/roskaraccoon / u/Mingly / u/-chu- / u/bitingwolves / u/HandSonic / u/leonoraMTY / Erin B. / Laurian / u/foxhatt / Alex Oliver / Kelly / Pow / Debit / Miriam from NZ / u/taebaegi / Gabe Chao / u/gasoline_gunner / Hira / Jacqueline H. - Vancouver, Canada / Ell / u/makosira / u/maegpup / kristi*
&gt;
&gt; Amount: *Amount donated here* (KAPS might have put it in )

This format is how KAPS suggested crediting the donation after we sent them the info.

Now...

Remember how we had a different deadline for submitting donations that would go to KAPS? It was *SOOO* worth it as we managed to raise ^(*drum roll please...*) **$ 408.21 USD**!! Yep. We were a bit hesitant to extend the deadline, as we usually plan deadlines with a comfortable amount of time to still leave us room and time to deal with unexpected ocurrences. But, we raised a bit more by extending the donation deadline and participants that weren't able to send a letter were still able to participate (with a donation) and that's always a plus! Will we do this 2-deadline arrangement for future projects? Probably not, and here's why:

As we had mentioned in the donation guidelines, we donated the amount as soon as donations closed at 5 pm on the 8th so it would get to KAPS on the morning of the 9th in time for Suga's birthday. Well, as international transactions go, there was an issue. We are in contact with KAPS and PayPal to resolve the issue, so no need to worry. We will keep you guys posted and announce once KAPS has received the donation.

It's a bummer the donation didn't make it on time for Suga's birthday, but the donation will still make an impact!

&amp;nbsp;

**Closing**

So that resumes the Suga birthday project...for now. We will keep you guys posted on any new info from PayPal and KAPS. If you have any questions, feel free to PM us or comment down below. We will gladly answer your questions to the best of our ability in an effort to be transparent with you guys.

Alright loves! Bye for now v( ^ - ^ )

The BTS Projects Team

----

&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE 3.29.17:** PayPal has resolved the issue and [KAPS has received the donation! ](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1298344040232157&amp;id=152371004829472&amp;refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2FKAPSAnimals%2Fvideos%2F1298344040232157%2F&amp;_rdr)

How many albums do they really have? Why do I feel like there's so many albums but Wings is just their second? 

What is cypher? Why are there so many parts? Like there's pt 2 of this and that. Help? 

Also, prologue and epilogues. I need help with that :( I recently just watched INU and it turns out a few other MVs are somehow connected to it? And then comments told me to read theories about them, so I tried. But they're mentioning something about a movie and a prologue? I couldn't follow. 

There will be days that I really really would feel overwhelmed. :( so I am asking for help!

For me:
1. After discovering them I fell in love with the Korean language and wanted to move to Korea and I did it!
2. When I listen to songs in English, I feel the lyrics much more deeply because I've become an active listener
3. I was a music snob throughout high school and college... Like the kind that only listens to certain types and bashes other people for liking pop music etc. BTS has opened my eyes to the world of music that exists beyond what I know. I always knew (as a music major) that music can transcend language, age, race, nationality, and more, but I never fully FELT it until I fell into Bangtan.
