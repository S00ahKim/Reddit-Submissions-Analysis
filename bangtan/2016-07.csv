0,2016-7-1,2016,7,1,12,4qpq89,What would be your 'We Got Married' pairing for the BTS boys?,madbsy,1467344396,"I'm not super well versed in other KPop groups besides BTS... But from who I know...

RapMon + Ailee (as of KCon)

They just seem like they'd be a KPop power couple. He's super handsome and manly, and Ailee's a gorgeous badass.


V + Wheein from Mamamoo

I love Wheein's energy and how adorable she is! I think she'd appreciate V's weirdness.

J-Hope + Moonbyul from Mamamoo 
They just look really cute together..

Side note (I thought about pairing V+Wheein and Moonbyul+J-Hope) before they MC'd together. When they did MC together I may have flipped my ish just a little bit :)

Suga + Me

Because we're soul mates duh. :)

I'm looking at Ticketcamp right now for tickets and even the lowest price is being sold for more than double. Even though I love BTS, I'm still a poor college student and don't want to spend $300+ on a ticket and not be allowed in if they do end up checking for IDs. 


Does anyone know if they check for IDs? Any type of advice is highly appreciated. Someone please give me your insight!  TT ^ TT",2,8

I love these pictures a lot, though I feel like it would've made more sense to me to make Hobi an air nomad, Jimin a water bender, and Taehyung an earth bender. Though, if we're going by the series, I guess it would've been impossible for Hobi to be an air nomad as there was only one at the time. And I do appreciate the distinction between the Northern and Southern water tribes for Jin and Hobi...that's pretty spot on, lol! All the same, I appreciate this art so much!

[Hobi](http://i.imgur.com/FnVUVCOh.jpg)

EDIT: Okay, after spending some time thinking about this more (I couldn't help myself), if I could draw (I'm terrible at it), here's how I would characterize each member in the Avatar universe:

**Namjoon**: The Avatar, a Fire Bender who comes from a town outside of Capital City. Probably grew up middle-class with parents who were seen as respectful Fire Nation citizens.

**Jin**: I really think the artist did a great job with Jin. It makes total sense that he would be a Water Bender from the Northern tribe, and while I wouldn't think he's the chief's son or anything, his family is probably pretty high in the social ladder. He's probably received several betrothal necklaces, let's be real!

**Yoongi**: Again, I think Yoongi being an Earth Bender makes a lot of sense. I would characterize him as being from a family almost as rich and important as the Beifongs, and him being a pretty brilliant fighter when he musters up the motivation to take someone on- I think he would've mastered Toph's use of seismic sense to earthbend given the chance.

**Hobi**: Hobi is a total air nomad! I can see him traveling the world, not even needing an air bison, just to get to know people from every nation. 

**Jimin**: I would have characterized him as a Water Bender- a Healer in the Southern Water Tribe, for sure. He's all about maintaining peace and harmony, and I could see him carrying that work over to heal others' bodies, especially when their chi is blocked!

**Taehyung**: I think Tae would be an Earth Bender, and would be from a farming town on the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. Maybe he'd run into the Cabbage Man and help him sell and/or [protect his cabbages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiMhue3iSd4), who knows?

**Jungkook**: Lol, spot on as a Fire Bender. I see him as being a member of a family that aren't royalty, but are pretty high up there. Probably besties with the Fire Nation Prince or perhaps betrothed to the Princess. He's a Fire Bending prodigy, obvi :)",13,29

A while back, they did a video on kpop songs, and Dope was one of them. I was really amazed by their dancing and Taehyung stood out the most (he looked like Detective Conan, one of my favorite animes... Added bonus: those legs). Liked the song, but I didn't completely delve into BTS.

A few years later, out came Fire MV. The choreo, the vocals, the visuals (they looked so *fine)*, EVERYTHING got me hooked. I searched up some videos about BTS and... I fell into a deep hole. I couldn't stop watching them. The cool guys from the MVs are such... cute and loveable dorks. ",61,31

92,2016-7-8,2016,7,8,2,4rpxqa,Question about Young Forever signed album,sarenboja,1467914129,"So one month ago I received an e-mail from Arirang Radio that stated: ""Dear participant, You have been selected as the winner of Arirang Radio's online survey."" and the album came to me today. Naturally I was really excited, but after seeing the actual album that they've sent I became worried that it could be fake. Don't take me wrong, I'm still happy that I'm one of the winners, but giving away fake merch and promoting plagiarism is not cool.
Things that made me worried are the golden sticker on the back that says C1 and not C2, and also the fact that it didn't come with any photo cards and/or poster. Everything else checks out, so maybe I'm just paranoid?

I would be sooo happy for them! I think dating bans and them being too busy to date is crappy!

But I would feel like a betrayed best friend! 

So BigHit better make a statement! :)

How do you think they will announce it? What do you think is the best way to announce it? How will you feel if we find out through pics on AllKpop.com?

I used to be a fan of big ~~bang~~ group and I now kinda see them (the big group) as jaded about life and music. I remember how they said in an interview about how they just stayed in their hotel rooms alone after a big concert and how they felt sort of empty.  

Hopefully, something like that won't happen to the boys in the future.  

Other worries:  

*They'll get hate if people find out they're dating. 
*Jungkook - I feel that he never really got to be a teenager. He has almost no social skills for talking to girls. We find it funny and cute but in reality I feel it's kind of sad.

It started from the first episode when I was surprised when they were handed cash and I thought what?  Are they that poor?  I know they don't make much but hello?  
Then after watching yesterday's episode when V was told using credit card is a violation of trip rule I was like wth? So are the boys not allowed to spend their own money ? I don't know how much allowance they were given but it sure doesn't look enough to me!  

They were supposed to be on holiday weren't they? Some rare time off &amp; change of scenery - yet they can't use their own money?  And they need to cook dinner instead of making the most of time abroad by eating in a local popular restaurant?  (this might be there decision but it should have sth to do with limited cash too) what im saying is they should have the freedom to decide when and where and how much to spend instead of having that choice takenbaway from them.  

As it turns out this trip is looking increasingly like a giant prop for making extra cash for bighit. When we purchase contents like this do they even get to th boys?  
Plus what's with the missions during a holiday?  Whilst I'm happy to see extra content I'd rather not have it at all if that means BTS gets to have a real holiday

I'm hoping I'm not alone!! After going on a tumblr/youtube binge of J-Hope stuff I actually had a dream about it, and it was vivid enough for me to remember.

My dream was first person POV with Hobi interacting with his girlfriend (me????). He was being all aegyo and cutesy (I think it's also transference since I just finished watching the drama Secret Garden). The best part about this dream was he was speaking in Korean and there were subtitles... I don't recall any more exactly what the subs said but I can very vividly imagine it and there definitely were subs while I was dreaming.

Needless to say I woke up pretty late today.

171,2016-7-14,2016,7,14,16,4ss2zn,My first time encountering a fellow BTS fan in real life!,lindajing,1468481976,"I work as an intern in a hospital and was sitting in the nurses' station filling out a drug chart when suddenly I heard ""DASI RUN RUN RUN"" play. I initially thought that my phone was malfunctioning and playing songs randomly, slightly embarrassed that it was playing Kpop but it turned out to be the ward pharmacist's ringtone! 

I approached her of course and started talking about BTS. She said her bias is Jin and I said mine was Jungkook (to which she replied ""isn't he a bit young?"").

Meanwhile the other pharmacist was sitting these judging us hard for fangirling, haha.

I was so excited to have a random Kpop encounter in real life in a totally unexpected place. Anyone have a similar experience?

Edit: Not my first Kpop encounter. I noticed that the case notes for one of my psych patients mentioned he listened to Kpop to de-stress so I casually asked about it during an interview. Turns out he was a giant A-pink fan, which was pretty adorable. He told me he didnt expect a doctor to like Kpop and I told him that we have the same interests as everyone else.",18,41

222,2016-7-17,2016,7,17,1,4t5dph,(Very friendly) vocal analysis!,ectomoroph,1468688259,"Hello! I'm kind of new to reddit (been casually lurking around the site for a while now but just recently made an account lol) but I've been a fan of BTS since the WOH/Danger era! I want to start a discussion on the vocal line's technique (timbre, intonation, support and stability, agility, range, musicality) and delivery of songs because I really respect BTS as artists, but I also want to understand them on a more technical note. I'm not a singer by profession but I underwent training and have been singing for a long time now, hahaha, so rest assured that this post/discussion is objective. Still I can't claim to know everything about singing, so of course I also want to know what you guys think. 

* **Range**
Sorry, I don't really know their specific vocal (not supported, which means this includes head voice/falsetto) ranges yet (I can't find any on YouTube) so to summarize, I think it would be (from widest to narrowest) **Jungkook&gt;Jimin&gt;Taehyung&gt;Seokjin**. Jimin can sing the highest without going into falsetto mostly because his voice is naturally high; his supported range is actually quite narrow due to incorrect placement. Jungkook has the widest range because he can reach high notes in falsetto, but also has good support in his low notes. Again, emphasizing that supported range is different from vocal range, and I'm only looking into vocal range for now.

* **Support and stability**
I would say that Kookie and Tae have better support (correct breathing and use of the diaphragm) than Jimin and Jin. I recently came across a comment from a trusted vocal coach saying Tae has shown better support than Kook, but through all the live performances I've seen them do, I'd beg to differ. Jimin has weak support, and has had incidences of being unstable during live performances (das all right son, just keep shaking that booty). Seokjin experiences the most difficulty with support, and it becomes very obvious sometimes.

* **Timbre**
Okay, this is the subjective part. Timbre is essentially the quality of the voice. Jungkook's voice is of the R&amp;B type, a tenor that carries a husky undertone and very solid falsettos. It has a youthful vibe to it. Jimin is a tenor with a very thin voice, also nice for R&amp;B but can also perform well in pop. Seokjin's voice is a little bit heavier, more orotund, than the rest of the vocal line, and has a brittle quality to it. Tae's is husky, deep, and strong but modulated; it goes well with classics and ballads.

* **Intonation and agility**
Jungkook has the best intonation and is the most agile among the vocal line as he seldom goes sharp or flat in comparison, and carries harmonies and runs quite well. Seokjin and Tae also have decent intonation, but Jimin may need a better ear for his notes.

* **Musicality**
Since Kook and Tae are the ones who lean more into the musical aspect of being idols than Jin and Jimin, as musicians, they are much more active in songwriting and doing covers. Kook has a habit of imitating people, but he is able to do well in making his own versions of his favorite songs, like in Lost Stars. He also has a knack for arranging harmonies, and knows the appropriate times for adding vocal effects. Tae's singing connects well to his audience because of his excellent voice moderation, and he grew so much as a musician during the HYYH era, having written a song and contributed to production. While Seokjin makes genuine and wonderful covers, which is something BigHit should give him more credit for, he remains a little idle in music production, singing only how he is supposed to sing and not daring to add dynamics to his parts. Jimin, on the other hand,  harmonizes and even attempts to do vocal runs, but these may be a hit or miss.

[Link to the oringinal tumblr post](http://agentstarlights.tumblr.com/post/147721035933/okay-guys-lets-do-some-boot-camp-right-here-right) 
&gt; Okay guys lets do some boot camp right here right now
The reactions towards RM and 1VERSE was extremely shameful on behalf of a lot of armys.
So I thought I should post some manners that we as fans should pick up for the upcoming release of Sugas mixtape

&gt; 1) APPRECIATE SUGAS WORK
yes we know that Suga is quite handsome but did he spend the last 3 years producing his face or his mixtape???

&gt; 2) INFIRES, LAZY SUGA, AND ETC MEMES ARE A NO GO
Im sorry guys, but those jokes are tasteless now. Theyre not a big deal in Korea, so they shouldnt be a big deal anywhere else. Im pretty sure Suga would appreciate sincere comments on his work rather than having to scroll down 5000 pages to just get to one Im really enjoying your mixtape! Youre a big inspiration to me :)

&gt; 3) DONT BE NASTY AND POST GROSS SEXUAL COMMENTS
Just please? Jungkook even said that he doesnt read a lot of the intl-army tweets because theyre too vulgar and sexual. Please dont take Sugas right to read the response he got from his fans all over the world.
BE MATURE AND PROFESSIONAL

&gt; 4) If Suga credits an artist/song for his mixtape, dont flood it with like if Suga brought you here! or the infamous any armys here?

&gt; 5) ONCE AGAIN IF ONE OF SUGAS TRACKS SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER SONG, IT IS NOT PLAGIARISM OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. MIXTAPES ARE FREE FOR DOWNLOAD, SO THEREFORE IT IS OKAY FOR THE PRODUCER TO SAMPLE ANOTHER SONG WITHOUT CREDITING THE ORIGINAL ARTIST (BECAUSE IT IS NOT CAUSING THE ORIGINAL ARTIST ANY FINANCIAL HARM)

&gt; 6) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ THE TRANSLATIONS FOR THE LYRICS. YOU WILL GET TO LEARN THE MOST OF SUGA THROUGH HIS LYRICS

&gt; 7) OTPS ARE NOT REAL. OTPS ARE PURELY A FANDOMS FANTASY. DO NOT FLOOD HIS COMMENTS WITH ANY REFERENCES TO YOUR OTP AND THINGS LIKE Omg, I bet he wrote that song for Jimin

&gt; 8) Before you make any references: this has been a widely spread mistranslation but the infamous line from cypher series is whether youre a boy or girl, my flexible tongue movements when I rap will send you to Hong Kong.
Being sent to Hong Kong does not necessarily mean to come it just means to feel really good.
Suga is more than his jokes and his laziness. He is not cold-hearted and he is not a meme for you to toss around. He is a man that had spent the past three years (maybe even since pre-debut) preparing for his mixtape and his own solo releases. He is someone that stays up till the early morning producing and writing lyrics for BTS and himself. He is someone that screams out of frustration, he is someone that went to the concert venue that he could not perform at and cried because he felt so ashamed of himself, he is someone that was told that he would make his family fail. He is someone that has been through so much and he is a man that is full of thoughts. This mixtape is something that hes worked incredibly hard on and is something that represents him. Min Yoongi. A person that sadly, we do not see much of because we perceive him as a character rather than an actual human being.
He loves Armys so much. But sadly, he has often seen our ugliest moments as a fandom (the Europe incident, being shoved and crowded at the airport, and countless of small other events). Lets make him proud by showing him our responsible and loveable side as intl-armys.
(Feel free to add on anything else you think should be said!)

What are your thoughts? What was your reaction? Do you think now is a good time for a mixtape release?

I for one can't wait to see how much he's grown as a solo rapper and a producer when it comes to his own work. As a fellow musician, I completely admire his dedication to true music and his drive to remain authentic to Hip Hop. It's amazing. I think now is a great time for a mixtape release. The Youth Series releases were all very close together, so I'm not sure that BTS will be coming out with a new album (full or mini) anytime soon. This will be a good way to keep the BTS steam going. Suga's individual popularity is growing quickly, especially amongst the ""Noona's of the Maknae line"" crowd - Holla for a dolla if that's you! Me: HOLLA

I think now is a great time to kick that popularity through the roof. Now that the boys have spend the summer doing individual shows, dramas, and other things, it's great that Suga is taking some time to showcase his individuality in music, which is his thing :)",30,23

It would have been an amazing opportunity for JH/JM/JK to participate alongside other idols and get some publicity, alas their schedule is probably the reason they are not in the lineup. The first  lineup's [preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1PV-AA9ZJg) showcases the contestants with some cool dance routines, but I feel like our dance line could give some of these idols a run for their money ://

Yesterday two [new competitors](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/07/more-idol-contestants-to-join-the-dance-battle-on-hit-the-stage) were added to the lineup and akp stated ""Brand new competitors will reportedly be joining the schedule with each new episode"". 

Bangtan's sched seems packed w/ concerts through August and possibly later, I have no idea. Do you all think there's a possibility of them being added in a later season? Bangtan has few variety/TV appearances compared to normal groups, I really am hoping they can get more comfortable on TV (not just for publicity but also to strengthen their careers beyond the group). 

If it happens, how do you think it'll go? In my dreams hobi would return to [this look](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/24/bb/66/24bb66c7af207a6bcebee8e4773a9f69.jpg) and kill us all",11,18

Really proud and happy that he was featured, proving that his talent and passion is getting more recognition.

It seems like an interesting read, as Joonie will be sharing his story and his take on hiphop

I have an artist alley stall and I was selling a few BTS prints/keychains that I made. They turned out to be really popular (I sold out of Jungkook, Suga and V so quickly!).

The best part about running a artist alley stall for me is interacting with other fellow fans and there were a lot of ARMYs that popped by (a lot surprised that someone was selling Kpop merch at an anime convention haha). I wore my HYYH hoodie during day 2 of the con which finally got the love and recognition it deserved! 

I met this girl in a wheelchair with really cool dyed hair who told me about about her experience at The Red Bullet concert in Australia last year. She had been lucky enough to land front row seats for the show. She says that during one performance although she had her eyes fixed on her bias (Jin), she noticed Yoongi trying to get her attention. She looked over at him and he walked up to hand her his (sweaty make up stained) towel! She says she has a soft spot for him after this but I still thinks she's Jin biased, haha (Seokjin handsomeness levels too strong).

My friend (my table buddy, also a BTS fan) and I were fangirling about the story with my initial reaction being ""THERE'S SUGA DNA IN OUR CITY?"". We were also joking that it sounded almost like a corny fanfiction in which Jin and Suga were competing for her affection.",13,52
