Trans: In whatever it may be, I think its best to become honest with ones heart. May it be work or something else. I may sound like my head is in the clouds, but you eventually come to terms with whatever you enjoy and persist on despite others laughing behind your back. Im running that course to make it it true for myself~ Ill make good music~
