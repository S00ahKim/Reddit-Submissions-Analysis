I've never been to a concert before and I don't know why suddenly these 7 guys would make me want to go to one this bad. I want to ask if anyone is going to LA  to watch them and to tell me what they paid for a ticket (I've looked but it only confused me)? I just wish things weren't so expensive( like college).,7,7

I haven't been a kpop fan for a particularly long time, but BTS has consumed more of my time than all of the other groups I fancy combined. Needless to say I am super excited I get to see these dorks live!!

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else around these parts is going and is interested in meeting up? I don't know many other people who fancy kpop so it'd be awesome to meet some folks irl! I fly in the morning of the concert and then fly out the afternoon after. ",2,3

It occurred to me that it would be totally awesome if someone took the same beat, but changed the lyrics to fit listening to kpop rather than writing hip hop. I might be able to come up with lyrics, but I have no musical talent so I hope someone has done this already. And if no one has, the time is now. ",2,3
