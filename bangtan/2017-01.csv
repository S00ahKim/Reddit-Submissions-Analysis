9,2017-1-2,2017,1,2,0,5lfj18,[Please help] I'm close to stop stanning BTS because of anger,SadBangtan,1483284284,"Hello, I hope Im not breaking any rules but after yesterdays performance Ive just been so angry at Bighit and Im afraid its getting the best of me.  


Im just so tired of seeing how they favor Jungkook and Jimin, which seems to be a normal opinion, this is something Ive felt too but never wanted to admit out loud before. It is just so unfair and I dont want to be immature and mad about it but when will Bighit give Hoseok time to shine? Hes the best dancer of the group but hes nothing more than a backup dancer to Jimin and Jungkook. Mama is the closest he got but he shared it Jimin.


I understand why the Hoseok fansite went on rampage last year and said that they favored members and that BTS is Jungkook sonyeondan. That Rainism performance was nothing but a solo stage for Jungkook with the rest as backup dancer no matter what you say. I dont think I really need to give examples when it comes to him because he has always had the most lines and center position. I shouldnt compare, but its always the same.


Jimin is also favored. He had so many solo stages this week when he got to show off his dancing. Why couldnt Hoseok get 1? He also has so many center parts and lines in their songs, why do they have 4 vocals when only 2 sing? I know Taehyung got to sing during the special stage this year but compared to the other two he had such a small part and last year nothing. Please do not try to use Hwarang as Bighit promoting Tae. V didnt get this acting gig because of Bighit, the director asked for him. Dont know about Seokjin and the jungle. Jin is also a vocal why didnt he get to sing? If Taes voice is too unique for them then why even add him to the group to begin with? Why not stay the 6-member group we thought they would be? Maybe Seokin would have gotten more opportunities then. A lot was lip synced so Jin not being able to handle it isnt an excuse either if that is how some try to reason about it. Dont use titles as excuse, Hoseok is main dancer so they mean nothing. 


Im sorry that Im an immature fan, I hate feeling this angry but yesterday was the first time Ive wanted Hoseok, Seokjin and Taehyung to leave and go solo. Which is why I wish someone could talk to me. I do not hate Jungkook or Jimin, please dont think so when reading this, even if it may look like I do. But I think Im starting to hate Bighit. I just want it to be equal, for them to have equal opportunities. Some might say that this is how they want it to be but i doubt it, I think they're just used to it and accept the unfairness. Im sorry Im petty.


Please either curse at me or try to explain or just say anything, I do not want to say good bye to BTS, but I dont know if I can stop feeling mad and some people on Twitter and OH are so extreme with either hating on them or calling this behavior from Bighit a kink so I don't know where else to turn. Im afraid Ill start to direct my anger towards Jimin and Jungkook and not only Bighit soon and I dont want it to come to that.


I'm sorry for making this post and i feel shameful for feeling this way, 

Edit: This post isnt about their popularity, Hoseok being 'less' or 'more' popular than Jimin isnt what I mean. I do not care about that. What I was and am saying is that the way Bighit favor some by giving them more lines and dance parts are what annoys me because I want all of them to have equal opportunities and they have not been given that.",43,0

I can't sing for shit and I have no knowledge of what a good vocal performance sounds like. I base all my opinions on Bangtan and their vocalists on how I personally percieve their sound, i.e. if I think it sounds good then it is good. Of course this isn't necessarily true and I would love some vocalists or people that know about vocal technique to clarify on the boys voices. Feel free to share what you think are the boys best (or worst, depending on your level of optimism) vocal performance, individually or as a group, as well. 

Also, after creepin' on this subreddit for awhile I've come to the conclusion that we are all pretty mature people here, so don't hold back because I won't be butthurt over any critiques that you give them. ",84,68

We're finalising the details for the J-Hope birthday project, but we would like your opinion on something. For the project, we're basically compiling fan messages, quotes, fan art, and cute/funny pictures, hopefully enough for one a day. No problem there. However, we are not sure how we would like to print these. We initially thought about printing the entries as postcards and putting them into a nice little box. Yet, as we were running costs, it appears cheaper to print them as a small book. We, the coordinators, had originally planned to cover all costs to allow as many of you guys as possible to participate. 

So our question(s) is: do you prefer the format of a book or postcards+box? And would you guys be willing/able to pitch in to help cover printing+shipping? Please let us know what you think! The survey form is [here](https://goo.gl/forms/M5Pw0U0XlHCs9h2Y2).

59,2017-1-5,2017,1,5,3,5m0ty5,How BTS has changed my view on masculinity,MyDeslexicWorld,1483554781,"This is more of a think piece on BTS and masculinity. Feel free to throw in your two cents.

Ive been thinking about this for the last couple of months while I developed male characters for some of my upcoming stories. In another post here, I mention how BTS has helped me redefine my perception of men and what is considered traditional/conventional male behavior. I am also writing this from an American or western point of view and how we often, up until men in skinny jeans popped up, expect men to act and look.

Recently the term toxic masculinity has been thrown around the web. If you dont know what that is [heres a good link that explains it a lot better than I can](http://popculturedetective.agency/2016/what-is-toxic-masculinity). Toxic masculinity is often linked to the more negative aggressive traits of men, such as domination and abusive behaviors. If we were to look for examples using BTS videos the short film Stigma and I Need U, in where the father is an abusive alcoholic would be placed under the toxic umbrella. Arguably the MVs Bulletproof part 2, Boys in lov, and Danger might fit in this category as the boys exhibit signs of anger and aggression toward both society and females. However, were not looking at the characters the boys play in their MVs. Were looking at the artists Bangtan Sonyeondan. How these seven men dont fit into the traditional masculine mold, at least by American standers, and promote, for lack of a better word, positive masculinity.

Before I continue, I just want to make clear that I am NOT bashing men or manhood. Much of what men do is learned or specific to their cultures normal expectations. Im also not going to go through in-depth character analysis of each member as thats something I see on this forum often enough. What Im focusing on is how BTS broke my perceived male mold.

American men do not show affection for one another beyond a slap on the back or a quick hug. The older generation, especially before the 1990s, created an image were boys needed to be tough or suave. Think Die Hard or Transporter in where the male hero is muscular and intimidating. Heroes, whether it be in action movies, TV, or comic books, reinforce the ideal man and frown at anything that challenges the image. If a guy does anything that is normally attributed to females or is seen as effeminate, they are instantly labeled as gay. Of course, only gay men wear makeup and like cute things, right? Forget the fact that half their favorite male celebs get their hair and makeup done at prestigious salons, I digress.

This is where BTS, and Kpop in general, comes in and shatters these molds. While some of their behavior is cultural norms for Korea, there are some traits they have that promote positive masculinity. First and foremost theyre willingness to show their vulnerability is probably the biggest, most positive trait I see within BTS. Second, the affection and praise they heap onto one another. Third, how they call each other and other idols attractive without fear of being labeled homo. We can also bring in the fact that they are trying to approach the view of women differently as well. Less objectifying women as sexual goddesses, and more praising and encouraging women to be strong.

It is overwhelmingly refreshing to see these behaviors embraced instead of shunned. BTS challenges the conventional male image and encourages others to do the same. The fact that these seven men are unashamed in what they do and like is incredible. Its shown me that there are more sides to explore when it comes to men and that its okay that my straight male friends take longer to do their hair and wear cardigans.

Wanna wear a dress and a corset? Do It!

Dont want to lose to Scandinavian men in the looks department? Primp in the bathroom (Bon Voyage)

Want your eyes to look good? Wheres the eyeliner!

Like cute things? Wear a Rayn PJ!


As a writer, it also gives me new ways to explore male characters instead of the typical tropes and archetypes. I can now make a character be a big badass Punisher-type, who also happens to like knitting drink coasters for stress-relief. I dont have to label him as gay or even make him ashamed. He can kick a guys ass and then give a drink coaster to the police chief as a birthday present.

Whew! Thanks for indulging me. Ive wanted to talk about this for a while now and show how BTS has impacted my written work. Plus Ive missed you all.

I'm new to reddit so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong.

I've been learning korean and was thinking of sending a fan letter to BTS. I've never sent fan mail before (in english or otherwise) so I just had a few questions for the people who have or who have looked into it. Please feel free to share any other info/stories you have outside of these questions too!

Firstly, does BTS actually read their fan mail? Have they ever replied or reacted to letters from fans personally or by video etc? I know we can't know for certain that they'll read it but it'd be nice to know that they receive it (especially when sending internationally).

Also, what is the correct address to send it to? I've come across two addresses (which only differ by floor level of the building) but I want to make sure I send it to the right place to maximise the chance of them reading my letter.

1.	Dope  has and always will be my most favorite MV of theirs in terms of song and video. The styling was on point (I love them in uniforms), just the whole concept was golden to me 
2.	Young Forever  I love the song, the message/lyrics, its simple but beautiful nonetheless (plus the setting made me so sentiment)
3.	Prologue  Im very much a ballad person, so Butterfly is my jam, plus I love the little short film incorporating with music. 
4.	INU  the whole HYYH trilogy will forever be special to me. And the Japanese ver was beautiful (flowers + flower boy)
5.	Save Me  simple, but I just like the beat so much, especially Jimins part in the beginning. And the one-take was cool
6.	Run/Fire  I like Runs MV more but Fires dance-moves were good. So its a tie. 
7.	BST  while the MV was very stunning and they looked gorgeous as heck, Im not quite fan of the beat, and their overtly attempt to be sexy was a bit cringe at times. That aside I love the WINGS short films though, like, a lot.  
8.	N.O  underrated but meaningful song + dance moves were cool
9.	No more Dream  they looked like fetuses trying to be badass, but the song grew on me, and I miss the all-black hair look on them (esp Hobis forehead!), I wish more of their title tracks had messages like these, society commentary + struggles
10.	One More Day  they looked so cute in here, and I adore the facial expression ver (I wanted to squish Jimins cheeks the whole time watching) 
11.	We are Bulletproof pt.2  wasnt a fan of the song first listen, but it grew on me, and the dance break section was the best, I couldnt take my eyes off Hobi the entire time
12.	Boy in Luv  badboys in uniform, whats not to love. The beat was rough but super catchy, love the dance. The only thing thats keeping it from moving higher on the list is how the woman was treated in the MV, I know BTS are sweet boys irl so I didnt like how the director made them do that. I mean if they had done it like the Japanese ver, would have been much better tbh (random thoughts: Ive always been puzzled as to why Jin/Suga were chosen as the ones to push the girl around, is it cuz theyre the oldest members and the actress is like older than Jin?) 
13.	Danger/War of Hormones  I like Dangers beat, esp the chorus, but wasnt too fan of some of the boys styling. Although they look really good in the Japanese ver (once again why do they always look so on point in the Japanese versions?)  
While I love WoHs styling (one of my favourite tbh, ripped sweater, messy hair, lollipop, leathers), the beat just really wasnt my taste. 

So what's you folks' ranking?

With the new year, the mod team has also decided to announce a few new subreddit things and inform you all of some rule updates. (Its a bit long, sorry, but its all very important and quite a bit involves us asking for **your** feedback!)  

#1. New Mods   

Recently, we welcomed /u/Eren_ to the mod team, and along with updating the CSS of the subreddit to the beautiful thing it is now, she has also been doing a wonderful job as a mod. However, since this subreddit (and BTS) is growing so rapidly, the mod team wants to act preemptively and add another mod before were in over our heads again (and certainly before BTS next comeback!)  

That being said, before opening an application process, we want to know if the community already has someone in mind and agrees on a user that would make an excellent mod. Keep in mind, this isnt meant to be a pure popularity contest. These are some of the qualities we are looking for in a person to be a mod:  

* Preferably in a timezone opposite of the current mods, or awake when the current mods are normally asleep (/u/dorkprincess is in UTC -05 (EST) and /u/Eren_ is in UTC -03). Ideally we would like those in the Eastern Hemisphere!  
* Fairly treats users' concerns equally  
* Responds to reports in a timely manner  
* Doesn't act on their own without asking for help first if they're unsure about something  
* Consistently implements the rules with as little personal bias as possible  
* On Reddit for a couple hours a day every day  

If we dont have a clear consensus for whom the community thinks would be a good mod, or the person nominated declines or doesnt fully meet all of these criteria, we will open an application that will be open to the entire community at a later date.  

#2. Scheduled posts  

I have scheduled AutoModerator to post megathreads for each of the WINGS tour concerts on the day they happen, to avoid a clutter of fancams, streams, pictures, and fanaccounts in the sub. There will be separate threads for each day for venues with multiple dates. These threads will all be posted at 5:00pm in the timezone the venue is located (e.g it will be 5:00pm EST for the Newark Concert, 5:00pm CST for Chicago, 5:00pm PST for Anaheim, etc.). There are also megathreads scheduled for the Seoul and South American tour dates. You should be able to view the entire schedule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/automoderator-schedule).  

In addition, Ive also scheduled megathreads to be posted by AutoModerator at midnight KST for each of the members birthdays. One of the mods will compile all of the tweets/facebook/other shenanigans in a stickied comment at the top of the thread. This way all the fun will be in one easy-to-find place :)  

#3. Rule updates  

The first rule the mods have decided to add is:  

&gt;We do not allow discussion posts directly comparing members' popularity to each other. If a comment section devolves into fighting about members' popularity, the entire post may be subject to removal.  

We have seen (and had to remove) several posts relating to members popularity in the past week. As a whole, the mod team has decided that these types of posts generally do not lead to any **net** positive discussion within the community and often end up in unnecessary fighting and defensiveness. Although we dont want to stifle productive discussion, the mods do not really see this type of discussion as particularly useful for anything. Therefore, we have decided that these discussions do not need to take place on this sub.  

For the next rule we were thinking about implementing, we want your (the communitys) feedback!  

We have seen some users complaints about more negative discussions, such as those revolving around the negative aspects of each member or other, less positive, topics more generally about BTS. We want to know if the community wants there to be rules in place for these kinds of posts, or if you all think there is no need for regulations.  

For example, would people like us to ban all of these kinds of posts? Only certain types (please explain which types more specifically)? Should there be a time limit between each negative post (ex. If there has been a similarly negative discussion in the past 6 months, it will be removed)? Only if it devolves into fighting? Some other type of rule? Please let us know what you think!   

#4. Subreddit Theme requests   

If you have any ideas for improving the overall CSS or theme of the subreddit, let us know down below and well do our best to try and make it happen!  


********  


Its been a lovely 1 -ish years since this community started to really grow, and Im very happy to mod a community as lovely as this one. I hope this sub keeps on going for as long as BTS does (which is hopefully a very long time). [Have a lovely 2017](http://pa1.narvii.com/6288/0cbbadbdcd74064425e0ace1dfd61ad35b2c28bc_hq.gif), and remember, [teamwork makes the dream work!](http://i.imgur.com/A0guhXx.jpg)  

*Also just going to take this time to remind you that you can always reference the rules and submission title guidelines [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) or by using the button in the sidebar! The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq) is also a very helpful place to look for answers. ^(Please flair your posts and title them correctly guys TT)*  

Remember to leave your nominations for moderators and feedback on our new rule proposal in the comments! If you have any other comments or concerns that you want us mods to know about, please also feel free to leave a comment down below or to send us some mod mail!

You can only vote once per account and the voting period runs till 15th January 2017. Results will be announced 17th January. You can make a V Live account with either Naver, Line, Facebook or Twitter accounts. 


I know it's not a huge award or anything, but it'll be a good way of thanking BTS for all the wonderful content they give us through their V broadcasts. So please try your best to vote! :)",11,47

Hi everyone! Some changes have occurred on the [BTS Content Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVG4gUFvl4Gt-DlEmm1IQLIga3zV1Xb55WMf0gygqF0/edit?usp=sharing) since I [last posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5k16o8/the_bts_content_index_google_sheets/). But more about that in a second.

Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for the great feedback! I've had quite a few people come to me with things I missed (really, really, really appreciated). I've began reaching out to subbing teams (it's a slow process lmao) and so far Bangtan France have expressed interest, and will soon start inputting their own videos! I'm having trouble getting 'bigger' twitter accounts to tweet about it though, so any help broadcasting it would be greatly appreciated!

Secondly, I want to thank /u/dorkprincess for her variety posts lately! I can never find RAW links for videos, so this is super helpful!

Thirdly, thanks to the mods for featuring the index in the 'related websites' part of the subreddit!

But time for, like, the actual point of this post. (I'm sorry, I ramble, I know it's not professional). There have been some *additions* to the spreadsheet - some boring ones, such as a 'Directory' which will tell you things like what has been updated, etc, and some... **interesting** additions. Longer additions. Additions you might not have been able to afford at the time......... additions naver might not want you to be able to find.... *longer* additions that come with photobooks. There's over 300 links for these editions, and, inexplicably, two of them are in arabic?

However, I'm not in the habit of getting on the wrong side of bighit, so [open up the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVG4gUFvl4Gt-DlEmm1IQLIga3zV1Xb55WMf0gygqF0/edit?usp=sharing) and **consider this riddle: can you MAKE a copy of a COPYcat? And can you VIEW a HIDDEN copy cat?** (This is so blatant. It's so goddamn blatant.)

Enjoy!! Remember, please follow @BTSContentIndex on twitter (I tweet updates), and [share the loveeee](https://twitter.com/BTSContentIndex/status/817951955335061505).

 Edit: the riddle was cute and romantic but lemme spell it out for you: make a copy of the spreadsheet, open the copy, and go view -&gt; hidden sheets!",44,138

He's our hope, he's our angel...

And his birthday is fast approaching...

Hobi~~~!! 
 
Hey guys!! Happy New Year!! So as some of you might already know from the [Tae project update](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5ji5ei/bts_projects_closing_post_for_the_rice_wreaths/) we are preparing to do a gift for J-Hope. We are announcing the project now since **1)** y'all managed to figure out our plans (without even trying too! lol) and **2)** we realized the project would do better off if we had as much time as possible to complete it. 

-----

**Volunteers needed!!**

We need illustrators/graphic designers, **translators** and people willing to help with clerical stuff (mainly sorting entries, organizing, reaching out to people, etc). Please PM us if you are interesting in helping us out and are available these next few weeks (8th Jan  31st Jan).

-----

Basically we wanted to do something that would cheer him up. He always tries to have a smile on his face to brighten our day, so we thought it would be nice if we did something to brighten up *his* day. Initially, we thought about doing a compilation of fan letters only. Then, we thought it would be nice if he was able to read one encouraging message every day for a year. So, now our plan is to **compile fan messages, fan art, inspiring or thoughtful quotes, and cute and/or funny pictures**. We tried to keep the guidelines as short and concise as possible, but if you still have questions feel free to comment below or PM us!

As to the format of this compilation, we conducted a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5lt8xq/bts_projects_thoughts_on_hobis_birthday/) asking you guys what kind of format you would like the compilation to take shape. From the [results](http://imgur.com/a/5hGgk), this compilation will be in book form. 

&amp;nbsp;

**QUOTES**

Were mostly looking for uplifting, encouraging, and thoughtful quotes that speak about friendship, working hard, family, ones dreams, goals, or aspirations, and similar themes. However, these are just to give you guys an idea (and to make it easier for us to organize), so by all means submit your favorite quote as long as its appropriate and follows these guidelines:

* Short quotes, about **&lt; 750 characters**, are preferred. To give you guys an idea, this is about 7  8 sentences long (~150 words). If you have a longer quote youd really really *really* like to submit, PM us to see if we can make an exception.

* Cite the person who originally said the quote if possible, unless its a popular saying. In which case you should credit it as  * Unknown*  or  * A popular [country/ethnic] saying*  (e.g. *A common Mexican saying*) whichever is the case.

* You can [submit your entry here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU4A_IXGBnDwmlYLYozN5nVsIdCNoii718NZD2ofdanYpoEg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1) if its just one. For single messages, please use the submission form only. For multiple messages, you can either use the form multiple times, or email them to us at armysunite@hotmail.com with the **subject line [QUOTE] JH Birthday Submission**. Heres an [example of how your email submission](http://i.imgur.com/yni5V0H.png) should look. Remember to tell us how you would like to be credited.

* If youd like to handwrite the quote, we ask that it be **legible, clearly scanned as an A4 JPG, PNG, or PDF file (at least 300 dpi) and emailed** to us at armysunite@hotmail.com with the **subject line *[QUOTE] JH Birthday Submission*.** Heres an [example of how your email submission](http://i.imgur.com/yni5V0H.png) should look. Remember to tell us how you would like to be credited.

&amp;nbsp;

**FAN MESSAGES**

You can submit an encouraging message, or one that commends him on his skills/performance, personality, looks (e.g. smile), etc. Since this smiley sunflower enjoys watching reaction videos, we would love for you guys to send your thoughts on how he has improved/grown over the years or a performance that stood out for you. Favorite memories, fan meets, performances, Hope on the Street, his logs/Bangtan Bombs are all valid. We just ask for you to follow these simple guidelines if you would like to submit a fan message:

* Keep it short, about **&lt; 750 characters**. To give you guys an idea, this is about 7  8 sentences long (~150 words).

* We havent had an issue with you guys on this, but Ill still say it to remove any doubts. **Please be appropriate**. Your message CANNOT contain anything inappropriate or any sexual content - we will remove your submission without warning if it violates this rule. (Examples of inappropriate content include but are not limited to the following: any references to: sex, BTS/nonBTS pairings/couples, self-harm, criticism directed to J-Hopes parents/family/friends, 'stalkery' tendencies, including your personal information such as phone/email/address/and the such, etc.)

* If you are submitting just one message, we suggest you do so through [this entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8QtwiWTaVGIS4y3a116jVHXJyKz4XNacRPHtOzyq-J-JXdg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1). However, if you are planning to submit **multiple messages, we suggest you email them to us at armysunite@hotmail.com with the subject line *[MSSG] JH Birthday Submission*.** This is not obligatory, but just for your convenience since the entry form just takes one submission at a time. Remember to tell us how you would like to be credited.

* You are allowed to handwrite your message, just please we ask that it be **legible, clearly scanned as a JPG, PNG, or PDF file (at least 300 dpi, maximum writing space 4 x 7 inches or so) and emailed** to us at armysunite@hotmail.com with the **subject line *[MSSG] JH Birthday Submission*.** Heres an [example of how your submission](http://i.imgur.com/N84U3ZR.png) should look.

However, if you want to send a picture of a breathtaking landscape, or a historic site, or a noteworthy location of your country, by all means do so! Remember to tell us the location, too. And, if youd like to include a small message (see message rules) with it you can! Both fan art and photo submissions follow pretty much the same guidelines, so:

164,2017-1-10,2017,1,10,2,5mz4fl,A trip down BTS memory lane ~,dorkprincess,1483984340,"Hello you guys!  

Since BTS has gained so many new fans, and sometimes it's impossible for new fans to backtrack through so much content, I thought it would be cool to take a trip down memory lane~  

The point of this is to post your favorite videos or interviews of BTS that a new fan might not have seen; the limit I'm going to put on this is it can't be from WINGS era. I'd also suggest you don't choose extremely well-known and quoted videos; a good guideline for what is a ""well-known"" video is anything within the [first half of my ""Welcome, first time with BTS?"" Youtube playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeVfMfa1HAgmraLfEl8kwEDesUpXJY9hN)  

And remember, if you are thinking of a video but can't find it, refer to the lovely [BTS content index](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5k16o8/the_bts_content_index_google_sheets/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=bangtan)!  

******

My picks would be ALL of the [Hanryupia BTS interviews](http://kimmy-trans.tumblr.com/post/114260066766/hanryupia-20141031-issuecatch-up-with-bts) [there's links to all of the other interviews between each member at the bottom]. I love them because you really get to see the dynamics between each pairing of members. I linked to my favorite interview, the Sugamon one, because you really get to see how they work together on music and lyrics which is always fascinating to me.  

My second favorite is the Image ranking interview ([part 1](http://mrsmon.tumblr.com/post/132398506017/bts-image-ranking-part-1), [part 2](http://mrsmon.tumblr.com/post/132468353132/bts-image-ranking-part-2)) because of how cute and funny it is :')  ",36,72

If you don't know, /r/streetwear is ""a community of fashion enthusiasts who are inspired by clothing styles derived by skateboard, surf, hip hop, and retro 80s/90s sensibilities. Streetwear continues to evolve in modernity, but tends to be distinguishable as an urban style to the general public"".

This means that I didn't save a bunch of airport fashion pictures of each member and put them in an album. It means that I searched for outfits that would fit in /r/streetwear or are very similar to that style since it's one I enjoy and find aesthetically pleasing. Why not spread love for BTS in other places? Enjoy :) :)

Were [always listening](http://i.imgur.com/FSkpa1X.gif) to the feedback you all give us, and so this post is our response to all of your suggestions on the [last rule update post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5mc5g7/rbangtan_announcements_2017_mod_suggestions_rule/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=bangtan)  

#1. Mod Suggestions  

We asked you all to give us suggestions for who you think would make a good moderator ~~to save us from the work of creating a mod application~~, but based on the number of nominations and upvotes those nominations received, there was no way for us to reasonably infer that the entire community overwhelmingly wants any single user to be a mod. We will make a post about moderator applications open to the entire community at a later date (Latest by the end of Jan) :)  

#2. Wiki  

Since more than a few users expressed interest in using this subreddits wiki to catalogue important information, we are excited to announce:  

###Anyone with over 250 karma on this subreddit and an account older than 7 days is now able to edit the wiki!  

I have already updated the [index page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index) to list all the pages we currently have. If you would like to make a new page, all you have to do is follow [this tutorial.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/wiki#wiki_how_to_make_a_new_wiki_page) If you have any ideas for wiki pages that you want to make, leave them below and people will hopefully be able to help you out with making it! Make sure to add it to the index page as well so people can find it easily.    

To access the wiki, go to the front page of the subreddit and look along the top bar for the button that says wiki and click it.  

#3. Subreddit CSS design  

/u/Eren_ is working on a few new updates for the subreddit layout, [please anticipate!](http://i.imgur.com/C5GT76r.gif)   

One of these updates includes possible image flairs, so if you have any suggestions for an image flair leave them down below. Keep in mind, we will most likely have **small** image flairs in order to not take up too much room in the comment section. There is a possibility that we may not use your suggestion for that reason!  

#4. Several New Rules  

You all proposed a couple of rules that the mod team unanimously agreed should be implemented. Heres the first one:  

&gt;No linking to posts on other platforms where the sole intention is to bash or be inflammatory towards BTS or other groups/fandoms.  

For commenting rules:  

&gt;Dont be disrespectful towards BTS members or other fandoms.  

Now for the big rule that we had asked for your feedback on: negative posts. Here is the rule we decided on:  

&gt;Any negative discussion topic about BTS that doesn't encourage constructive criticism will be removed. For example, this includes things such as:  

&gt;* Bashing/criticizing a member's personality  
* Comparing members in a non-constructive way (for ex. a post titled ""I don't understand why J-Hope is the main dancer when Jimin is way better than him"" would be removed, while ""What are your opinions on J-Hope vs. Jimin's dance styles?"" would not be removed).  
* Any other post the mods deem as bashing, or any post whose comments devolve into bashing or fighting.  

If you need further clarification on this rule, our reasoning behind it, or any other rules, feel free to ask in the comments below or via [mod mail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbangtan&amp;subject=&amp;message=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fbangtan%2F) You can always review all of the subreddit's rules by looking at the [rule page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules)  

*******  

That about does it for announcements this time around! Well meet again at the mod application post soon~ [See you then](http://i.imgur.com/dpfD4Xg.gif)

I was listening to Amine's Caroline when all of a sudden I started wondering how BTS writes their raps. Basically, one of the defining characteristics of hip-hop music is the language, like new slang, odd subject-verb agreement (lol), ""wrong"" tenses...although all of these are considered and accepted as part of African-American culture (i.e., a different language* altogether) Now, I don't fully understand or speak Korean, so I'm very curious about how Namjoon, Hobi, and Yoongi write their raps. Like, in Korean hip-hop, is there some sort of linguistic style that is akin to African-American English? And how does it fit in with their culture? How ""colloquial"" are the lyrics? How much of the writing style is lost during translation? (So many questions lol)

222,2017-1-13,2017,1,13,15,5np6f3,[DISCUSSION] Reason why some Korean fansite manager (masternims) are closing and its impact to BTS and Army,Lyandle,1484290733,"
Several fansites has been closing rapidly this past days, some posted their reason for doing while other did not. I honestly do know what would be the impact for this nor their exact purpose, except for organizing events. However, the amount of fansites that are closing are alarmingly a lot and in consecutive hours. 
So here are my queries. 
What are the most-like reason why a fansite suddenly decided to close?

Some masternims also were being bashed for being accused as a sasaeng, but are they really are? Or is it just because they are well updated on a BTS member that an speculation might occur? And what are the basis why they are considered as sasaeng.

If they decided to close now, will there be an effect to the february comeback? ",22,27

This time we'll have to choose between * Young Forever*'s songs. Reminding you all that repeated songs are only included in the survivor of the album they first appeared in, so this survivor is going to be shorter than usual (only 2 rounds).

This is a game to determine which song we like best from each album. All you have to do is
#vote for the song you like the least.
Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

I'm all caught up to ep. 8 and V has a very minor role right now.

To clarify, I'm not annoyed because V doesn't have a ton of screen time. He's a new actor, and a role like this is awesome for him! What I'm NOT cool with, is that he was apart of the promotions with all the main characters, but none of the other supporting characters were. I was under the impression that he would have a secondary role, not a supporting role. I think this may have been purposeful....

Of course I will continue to support Hwarang, and while it's off to a slow start, I'm interested in where the story line is going.

265,2017-1-15,2017,1,15,14,5o2a7m,[Discussion] BTS' musical journey,azurepelagus,1484458037,"What do you think about BTS' musical journey since debut? Do you prefer their older, hard-hitting hip hop style or their more mainstream sound since ~HYYH? How do you think the members themselves have matured musically (esp. the rap line since they produce so much) and think about their current sound?

Personally, I think that their current sound is more comfortable for the members as a whole (Jin looked a bit uncomfortable during their debut stages), but RM/Suga may feel a bit restricted by a more mainstream sound. However, I'm glad they got to release mixtapes to explore different musical styles and that their releases were well received. ",17,31

But I can't find it anywhere.

So, just comment if y'all want it as well as a New Years resolution of yours. I'd like to keep the positivity up and hear from you guys as well. (:

Basically, who do you think the other member's mains are if they did play?

Personally I feel like Tae would be one of the picks really out of the meta (ex: ~~Handsoap~~ Hanzo or Junkrat) just to troll people, J-Hope would be Lucio because he's so happy all the time, Jin would be Mercy because he's like BTS' mom, Rap Mon would be Bastion and Jimin would be Roadhog or Genji to match Tae.

#Save ME!
Its opponent *EPILOGUE : Young Forever* got eliminated with 50.4% of the votes.

This was by far the toughest round in all survivors - I couldn't stop myself from checking the poll results every hour or so, and both songs were always so close to each other, sometimes even with the exact same amount of votes (here's [some](http://imgur.com/LKs5VfZ) [screenshots](http://imgur.com/S2mAcfq) I've taken). Even though I rarely announce the results at the same time the round was posted, this time since the votes were so so close I waited for the exact minute the reddit post made 48 hours for this to be as fair as possible.

This was also the round the most votes ever -- **740 votes** -- and while at first I felt happy that so many people are participating in the survivor, I then realised that these are way too many votes compared to all previous rounds. In the beginning of these survivor rounds, we always had around 200~250 votes per round, and that number has *slowly* been increasing - lately we have been getting around 500~550 votes. Still, this sudden increase of ~200 votes has never happened before. It made me think that some people might have cheated and voted multiple times to save their favourite. A few hours ago, I decided to track the votes in real time for a while and saw one of the songs getting votes at a faster than usual pace. Unfortunately, there is no way for me to prove this was cheating, but it seems like the most likely scenario. The polls already have IP duplication checking enabled, but obviously there are still ways to cheat that I can't control. I know this is just a game and it's nothing that serious for me to get worked up about, but I'd still appreciate if we all played fair. :)

As always, are you happy with the results?

Channel+ seems to be a monthly subscription, and Vlive says that the profits will ""be used for the creative activity of Stars"". It promises a special, closer experience with our favorite idols, where we get exclusive content and broadcasts. Though the way the describe the membership as supporting ""fans' next generation close-up fanatical act"" is hella dodgy, hahaha. 

Anyway, this sounds pretty dope! For me, 3PM KST will be about 1AM EST, but I'm totally willing to get up for a free trial. It seems like there will be different prices for different channels, instead of one price for all Channel+ content, which is a bit annoying and pretty much guarantees that the most popular groups will have the most money to do more creative activities. But, I suppose that bodes well for our boys, ha.

383,2017-1-23,2017,1,23,13,5pm9zo,"170123 [Music Watch] ""Unfinished Story"" BTS: Why is it a ""Side Story"" Comeback instead of a ""Special Album""? - Newsen",flowerygarden,1485145759,"[Newsen Reporter Hwang, Hye Jin]

It seems it will be something greater than what we can imagine.  Group BTS, who rose to global stardom (Rap Monster, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, Jin, Jungkook) have finalized a comeback for this February.

According to their agency BigHit on January 23rd, BTS will begin promotions after the album release on February 13th.  This is a new album that is being released approximately 4 months after their 2nd Album, ""WINGS"" which was released on October 10th of last year.

The time period for activities have not been finalized yet.  Following the beginning of their ""2017 BTS LIVE TRILOGY EPISODE III THE WINGS TOUR"" on February 18th and 19th in Seoul, Kuro koo, Gochuk dong, Gochuk Sky Dome, they will be touring in Santiago (Chile), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Newark (NJ) and Anaheim (LA).  Due to this World Tour consisting of 7 dates in 5 cities across 4 Countries, their first music show appearance is expected to be either on the week of the new album release, which is before the concert in Seoul, or after the conclusion of the world tour.  Should their promotions begin after the tour, there is a possibility that the new songs will be first revealed during the tour.

The news of their comeback is stirring up interest in fans and people in the Industry alike.  It is no surprise as their album ""WINGS"", like its definition, soared through the top of Music Charts not just in Korea but broke the record of being the first Korean album to rank 26th in America's Billboard 200 Chart, making it their 3rd consecutive feat as well as being the first Korean album to enter the UK's Official Albums Chart ranking in 62nd.

Interest in whether BTS's new album will once again sweep across Music Charts and be successful in entering the Billboards 200 for the 4th consecutive time is surfacing.

In the midst of all this, a lot of attention is also being focused on the peculiar album title.  The title of the new album being released in February is, ""WINGS SIDE STORY: You Never Walk Alone.""  BTS has been alluding to the new title as early as last December 29th through the stage screen during their performance of ""Fire"" on 2016 KBS Gayo Dae Chookjae, which read, ""You Never Walk Alone.""  Also when ""WINGS"" went on sale, there were 4 versions released, each version representing ""W"", ""I"",  ""N"", ""G"", which led to questions about the missing ""S"" being a ""Special Album.""  However through the recent reveal, it seems it will mean ""Side Story"" than a Special album.

That leads to the question of why they chose the format of a ""Side Story"" instead of a Special or a repackaged album like they did with the release of ""HYYH Young Forever"" last May, which concluded the ""HYYH"" series on youth.  BTS has added variety to the special album by including edited versions of some of the original songs of ""HYYH"" along with 3 new songs, which included ""Fire"".

In regards to this, an insider tipped Newsen, ""Just like it states, it's an album that tells a story that was left unfinished in 'WINGS'.  Whether it will be an album consisting of a whole new soundtrack or a format of adding new songs onto the original soundtrack of 'WINGS', will be told through the track list which is being released soon.""

BTS sung of youth facing temptations for the first time through ""WINGS"" while making their hope of wanting to each have their own tracks a reality within a year through incredible storytelling, talent and mature musicality.  What unfinished story they want to tell in extension of ""WINGS"" is drawing attention.

Deserving of their Self-producing artist status by participating in writing, composing and producing their songs from their debut album to their most recent album ""WINGS"", it is said that the members actively participated in the composition of their new track as well.

===========================================================

Wow, I haven't translated in a while so this probably doesn't have good flow but I thought this article was interesting and wanted to contribute to this subreddit :)

Since the pre-orders for the new album starts on the 25th, I'm assuming we can expect the track list in the next day or two?
So hyped!

Please let me know if the formatting of this is incorrect or if I'm breaking any rules!  It's my first post and I *think* I followed the all the guidelines...but I could be wrong, so :'(",24,98

I'm traveling to Korea for business/Wings Tour on February 14 and ordered my albums already, and thought I'd help out any Filipino ARMY who wants to buy the album but doesn't have PayPal/CC or would like to receive the album immediately vs. waiting for it to be shipped from Korea 2-3 weeks after ordering from local shops. Please read through the post for more details. Thanks! :)

**NOTES:**

* This GO is posted with permission from the mods, however they are not responsible for any issues with the GO. Please direct any questions or concerns to me.
* Albums will be ordered via Synnara and will count towards Korean charts.
* I don't earn commission from this group order, however I had to charge an additional fee because my Airbnb host will be dealing with the order for me (as I won't be in Korea yet by the time it gets shipped to his place) and unfortunately added a tiny service charge. 
* I can only order max 10 albums due to baggage constraints. So if you order a set, that's already 2 slots gone. 
* I will try to make this order run as smoothly as possible (this isn't my first time handling a GO but it IS my first time to do one for BTS &gt;.&lt;) however please make it easy for me as well by ensuring you're 100% pushing through once you submit an order. 

**SLOTS AVAILABLE AS OF JANUARY 27: 2

**Additional slot available:** Right version with poster and standee (another friend backed out and I already paid for this so the standee is guaranteed, I just need someone to take over the slot) - 1

**Prices:**

* CD Only - 850
* CD with poster - 1000
* Set with poster - 1800

**Payment deadline/s:**

* January 27 - only for those who really want the standees
* February 2 - regular order
* **All orders include a poster!**

**Albums arrival date in Manila - February 22**

**MEETUPS ARE HIGHLY PREFERRED** for orders with posters. I can meet up at any of these locations on weekdays: 

* Eastwood - Weekdays

* Cherry Foodarama/Circle C/Starbucks Congressional Avenue - by appointment

**Shipping fees:**

* 90- within Manila
* 180- outside Manila including Rizal

**To order:**

Send an email to queenbrat04@gmail.com with the following info and with the subject line: 'BTS 'You Never Walk Alone' order':

* Full Name:
* Contact number:
* Reddit username:
* Shipping/meetup:
* Order: ONE LINE PER ORDER
* Quantity / version / type (example: 1 / Left version / CD only)
* Shipping address/meetup location:

I will reply to your email with the totals and payment methods. I accept BDO bank deposit only for now, but if you work in the Eastwood area I can also accept payment via meetup.

Feel free to reply to this post with your questions! I had problems with my Reddit app not alerting me of any messages/post replies but it should be working fine now! :)

I live in the U.S. (East Coast), and my girlfriend is a *huge* fan of kpop, and BTS is one of her favorite groups. I don't necessarily keep up with stuff related to kpop and BTS; I think it's really cool, and I love that she loves it, but I don't exactly know everything about it, if that makes sense.

I thought it would be cool to preorder this for her. However, I'm not entirely sure about what to preorder or where to preorder.

As far as the *where*, what are the most reliable sites for preordering kpop merchandise in the U.S.? Also, what is the best site for getting the album in the shortest amount of time? I am aware that it releases a day before Valentine's Day, so it would be cool to get it on time (that is, unless it actually ships *after*  Valentine's Day; in that case, what's the fastest shipping?)

As far as *what* to preorder, I'm seeing multiple versions of BTS' new album. I want to get the best version, whatever it is. Some sites are offering an *extended edition*, which features ""2 CD + 2 PHOTOCARD + 2 POSTER"". Is this just two of the same album? Or is this a special edition?

Sorry if none of that makes sense...I just need some help, so if anybody is willing to help, but needs clarification on what exactly I'm asking, just let me know. I'll be here all night. I really wanna do this for my girl. :)",10,13

Personally, I don't consider myself to be a K-pop fan even though technically, I really am one since BTS is a K-pop group. I just don't think about that anymore as much as I know that it's true. BTS has made me so much more open to K-pop and probably one day, I'll be able to try out more artists although truthfully, the only Korean artists I listen to are BTS and IU. It's just that BTS is so unique and special to me and for so many others that they are able to attract people who are not inclined to listen to K-pop. That is the case for me. I love that many of their songs have such meaningful lyrics, and that through these lyrics, I could see a glimpse of what they want others to know about themselves and what they believe in. I love that they come from humble beginnings, and that even to this day, I can feel that their humility is real. I love that despite my deep dislike for K-pop a few years back, they were able to soften my heart and open my mind, and they made me understand that new things are not necessarily bad things. 

I've been with BTS long enough to be aware of many things in the K-pop fandom, and I know that haters and anti's would list a thousand things of why it's stupid that I think BTS is special and that they're no different from the other groups. However, I know deep inside me that there's **something** about BTS that will draw you in - young, old, K-pop fan, or not - and I think that's beautiful.",42,49

I swear I do more than I would like to sometimes.  I think deep down I just can't stand that SO many people have no idea what I'm talking about!    
    
As for my weirdest place - I was in the ER last night (nbd, usual heart stuff) and my male nurse had to ask when I last had bad heart palpitations - I responded ""uhhhhh, yesterday when I got tooooo hyped watching a kpop video""    
    
**People** - that opened the doors of heaven.  Turns out his 50 year old partner is OBSESSED with kpop and loves Girls Generation so I busted out singing ""Gee"" with a needle in my arm and my nurse dying of laughter.  Then he said ""trust me, you do not want to see a 50 year old gay man dancing around to kpop"".  I told him that was everything I wanted in life!    
    
As it's done before, my status as an obsessive ARMY has saved the day again.  When I mentioned BTS the girl that was drawing my blood at the time said (quietly and shyly) ""I know how they are!"" and then blushed in such a cute way.    
    
Ugh - it's just the best. I had a fun time actually for the rest of the night because the staff kept asking me questions about Korea.  I sometimes just feel really lucky to have found this band.",116,76

488,2017-1-30,2017,1,30,10,5qxnkd,Philippines Group Order: You Never Walk Alone and BTS Official Light stick v2,queenbratinella,1485739252,"Hi! I'm sorry to clog the sub but I couldn't edit the title of the other post. 
Anyway this is a group order for Philippines only. I'm traveling to Korea for business/Wings Tour, so I thought I'd help out any Filipino ARMY who wants to buy the album and now the official light stick as well, but doesn't have PayPal or a credit card or would like to receive their items immediately vs. waiting for it to be shipped from Korea 2-3 weeks after ordering from local shops.

**UPDATE FEBRUARY 10:** Album and glowstick orders have all been placed and PayPal payment proofs have been sent to all buyers. Please also add me on Twitter @stresscactus if you want quicker updates. Next update will be when I receive the goods in Korea. Thanks!

Please read through the post for more details. Thanks! :)

**Prices:**

* CD Only - 850
* CD with poster - 1000
* Set with poster - 1800
* Light stick - 1650

**Album slots available as of February 7: 4**

**Light stick slots available as of February 7: 5**

**Added fansite goods as of February 7:**

* Honeybubble slogan [PREVIEW](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1GRu15UcAAhm2v.jpg) - 500
* SugaFlow 'Sweet Holic' Season's Greetings/Calendar [PREVIEW](https://twitter.com/sugaflow93/status/812269149720231936) - 1000
* SugaFlow photo slogan [PREVIEW](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0IUejtVQAAVwj6.jpg) - 550
* FistBump 'Lovable Boy 'Season's Greetings/Calendar [PREVIEW 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ctw6QE_VIAAJg0O.jpg) [PREVIEW 2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ctw6QE_VMAAFIqV.jpg) - 1200php
* Isuga93 'Sunlight Season' Season's Greetings/Calendar [PREVIEW](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0hSBzMVIAINgaE.jpg) - 1000php


**NOTES:**

* This GO is posted with permission from the mods, however they are not responsible for any issues with the GO. Please direct any questions or concerns to me. 

* Updates are automatically done via email, although I finally made a Twitter at @stresscactus

* Albums will be ordered via Synnara and will count towards Korean charts. The official light stick will be ordered through via the BTS Official shop. Fansite goods will be prepaid to the fansites and will be shipped at my place in Korea. I can't pickup directly at the concert as it's likely going to be chaotic/risky of goods getting lost. 

* I don't earn commission from this group order, however I had to charge an additional fee because my Airbnb host will be dealing with the order for me (as I won't be in Korea yet by the time it gets shipped to his place) and unfortunately he added a tiny service charge. Also, Big Hit operates on a 1=1 exchange rate for USD to KRW for some odd reason so the 30,000 KRW light stick is being sold to international fans at 30 USD, instead of the actual conversion rate of 25 USD. 

* The first batch for the GO was originally for 10 album slots due to baggage constraints. I am adding an additional 6 slots, along with 10 slots for the light sticks. Slots are PER ITEM, not per order (e.g. if you order 2 albums that is already 2 slots from the 6). 

* I will try to make this order run as smoothly as possible (this isn't my first time handling a GO but it IS my first time to do one for BTS &gt;.&lt;) however please make it easy for me as well by ensuring you're 100% pushing through once you submit an order. 

**Payment deadline/s:**

* Albums and glowsticks: February 10
* Fansite goods - February 13
* IMPORTANT: I will place album orders on February 10, 11pm therefore I cannot guarantee the special gift anymore for this 2nd batch of albums. Please take note of this when submitting your order. 

**All goods arrival date in Manila - February 22**

**MEETUPS ARE HIGHLY PREFERRED** for orders with posters. I can meet up at any of these locations on weekdays: 

* Eastwood - Weekdays
* Trinoma and SM North - 7pm onwards on weekdays, anytime on weekends

**Shipping fees:**

* 90- within Manila
* 180- outside Manila including Rizal

**To order:**

Send an email to queenbrat04@gmail.com with the following info and with the subject line: 'BTS YNWA/Lightstick Group Order':

* Full Name:
* Contact number:
* Reddit username:
* Shipping/meetup:
* Order: ONE LINE PER ORDER
* Quantity / version / type (example: 1 / Left version / CD only)
* Shipping address/meetup location:

I will reply to your email with the totals and payment methods. I accept BDO bank deposit only for now, but if you work in the Eastwood area I can also accept payment via meetup.

Feel free to reply to this post with your questions! I had problems with my Reddit app not alerting me of any messages/post replies but it should be working fine now! :)",8,23

We have a huge number of new people, I thought it would be nice to share these as I haven't seen them pop up recently on the sub.

When I was first getting into the fandom (February 2016), I came across this series that breaks down BTS history from pre-debut to late 2015. I wanted to give this person a shout out for dedicating so much time and effort to put these videos together. I hope you all enjoy them as much as I did. If you think there's something missing or just want to share a trip down memory lane, feel free to add to this thread.
