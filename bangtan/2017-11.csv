This is the most recent article to have been posted by Big Hit Entertainment's Twitter. I think it's necessary reading for every fan, and knowing that this is the message they wanted us to take home about the 'Love Myself' campaign kills me.

I've translated it, so feel free to ask any further or clarifying questions! (It's not the full article, which is why it's in bullet points, but all the new information is there.)",14,106

HMMM!!!

I am going to take a wild guess they will be flying straight to the US for a promo tour right after their Macao concert.  I am hoping they will do the following:

In NYC:
-TRL
-Macy's Thanksgiving Parade
-Radio stations
-Meet and Greet (please???)
-GMA, Today Show, Live with Kelly and Ryan, Jimmy Fallon
-tons of magazine interviews (seventeen, RS, Vice, Billboard, etc).
-probably promote their BT21 merch at the Line store at Times Square

Also visiting LA (The Ellen Show, James Corden show), SF, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Toronto, Vancouver.

Maybe I'm reading the tweet into deep and perhaps being a bit delulu and none of this will happen (if that's the case, I do apologize in advance for getting everyone all hyped up!).  

But what are your wish lists if they are coming to the US to promote their album?",45,52

66,2017-11-3,2017,11,3,19,7ailkk,"Empty November Schedule, How Suspicious Are You?",not_Someone_else,1509706186,"As we all know, bts's schedule is abnormally clean this month and a lot assumed this is going to be a quiet November for us all, but with the recent Ellen news, the Steve Aoki slip up and other *hints*, it's starting to get apparent that maybe that's not going to be the case.

To summarise (from the top of my head) the info we have so far:

* Big Hit confirmed invitations from multiple tv stations, no attendance confirmed
* Steve Aoki, ' We're working on some fun stuff.'
* Desiigner: Desiigner X BTS, later retweeted by @bts_twt

* US PR reps acting annoyingly teasy

* Big Hit rep,  'bts schedule until 2018 are already set.'

* bts took a vacay before October was over
* From Billboard article a few months back: '...more U.S. dates might be on the way later this year.'
* RM hinting to a New York visit
* bts needs to fit four, possibly five, albums before 2019
* Korean journalists hinting for something big to happen (they might've meant the UNICEF campaign, but I'm still adding it here just in case it was something else)
* V slipping up they'll meet their US fans soon.

So like, what do you guys think of this? I think this is suspicious enough to deserve its own thread. It's already obvious stuff is cooking, but it's also possible that we won't get releases/events this month and they're just working on stuff.

Do *you* think they're releasing something this month?

Whatever they're working on seems to be U.S. focused. Do you agree?

Just generally, how suspicious are you and what are you suspecting?

Edit: bts confirmed to perform on the AMAs a few hours later...",33,60

I don't know if I'm reading into this too much or if I'm stating an obvious thing everyone knows, but... this is a forum site, right? I'll put these thoughts here, and whatever you think, just type in the comments. I have no idea how will this be received...

***

This post was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/t_dipqt7kqo) which was made to open a dialogue between the uploader and his audience about thoughts he had about Her, but I thought it was worthwhile to have the discussion here in reddit. I think he came up with good points about bts' future direction in that video by taking only their musical direction in mind, but considering recent developments, (the AMA announcement, possible collabs, etc...), his points might've been just... kind of prophetic?

Anyway, before we start this, I think it's a good idea to check his [DNA reaction](https://youtu.be/Exa4C9Tz56s) for some context.

Points to consider for this discussion:

* BTS' new brand identity
* [This small discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7a44ax/171102_4th_muster_happy_ever_after/dp7g3kw/) I found in this sub which I think deserves a mention
* All the interesting developments we're seeing in America recently
* [This translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7a83mp/171102_from_seo_taiji_to_bts_how_music_changes/)might have some points relevant to the discussion, especially the point about no one getting fully the message of the Love Yourself series
* Suga saying they knew the album was risky but pushed it anyway

* ^Edit: The Love Yourself series being released out of order

There are some... subtle developments. This time it's not about U.S.artists dropping hints like hell will break loose otherwise, but I think... bts is slowly pushing a change we might not notice if we don't keep our eyes open. They *are* going through a rebrand beyond their logo, but it's slow, and I think it's beyond their image and music. It might be too big and ambitious for us to swallow at first which is why they're going slowly. These are my thoughts about this.

I want to ask what are *your* thoughts. You think people like me and that reviewer are reading too much into this? If there is some kind of change, how do you think it'll affect the bts brand or image?

Overall, I just want this to be an open discussion about bts future direction overall, America, Korea, Japan, general image, general brand, marketing tactics... just, overall. What do you think with everything happening recently?",132,48

- People like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Diana Ross, Selena Gomez, Sam Smith, and Kelly Clarkson are going to witness their performance live. 

- being announced as one of the most anticipated performances of the night with Lady Gaga, Christina and Diana.

 So the birthday of my friend who is really into BTS is coming up.

Her birthday is very soon and I live in Europe, so I don't know in what way that will complicate things. So I came here looking for help. Can anyone recommend some merch stores or specific merch items? ones that will arrive in time and you have had good experiences with ? (Her Birthday is in 8 days) I have a 40-50$ budget. Oh and I should mention she has no bias. So anything goes really.

So BTS Army California posted on Twitter that they were accepting donations to help send more local ARMYs who couldn't afford tickets to the AMAs. I thought this seemed like a really nice thing to do, but it doesn't seem to be getting a huge amount of attention on Twitter. The idea is that if you live too far to attend or you already have tickets and would like to help more ARMYs attend, you can contribute an amount of your choosing, and the BTSxCalifornia account will buy as many tickets as possible with the donations (the ultimate goal being to fill the crowd with as many ARMYs as possible to cheer on our boys). If you are a local ARMY who is over 18, you can also DM BTSxCalifornia to get on the list for a potential ticket.

172,2017-11-7,2017,11,7,12,7baom0,Secret Santa - ADOPT A STAN,BTS_SecretSanta,1510027049,"Hey guys, u/Erinzilla83 here again!

So we rolled out the Secret Santa registration last time, and it went great! We have around 100 people signed up and the matching is underway! I originally came up with the idea for the SS because I know its not always easy (for various reasons) for every fan to buy merch. In fact, until I made the fatal (to my wallet) error of discovering group orders on Twitter, the only merch I had was an album I won in a Facebook giveaway and a Suga sweatshirt that my best friend bought me last Christmas.

However, there is one big downside to the whole Secret Santa thing, and that is, you have to have at least a little money to participate. You have to prepare a gift and then ship it. After helping out with the census last year, I got to see firsthand just how diverse our little corner of the fandom is here at r/bangtan; and, I also noticed that we have a lot of university students, and others, who might be on very tight budgets. I, too, have a very limited budget. My family and I are often living paycheck to paycheck, so I know how it feels to not have the money to participate in something, and I dont want to leave you guys out!

So, in the spirit of trying to include a little of everyone, I came up with the Adopt a Stan program! :) Ill give you guys a slight overview of what it is and how it works and you can decide if its for you.

Im going to start this off by saying, I am paying for all of this out of my own pocket (I will have some help with the mailing costs), so this year it will have to be on the small side, and for that I truly apologize. I wish I had the money to just send everyone something, but I dont. Hopefully next year, we can expand it a bit.

&amp;nbsp;

Im going to link a form down below that you can fill out. It will ask a few basic questions and your mailing information. The only two rules I have this year for it are:

**1: You cannot be signed up for the Secret Santa.**

**2:  You must be in the US (this is solely due to shipping costs).**

I will take the first 30 people that fill out the form. You will then receive a small package from me next month :)

[**Adopt a Stan registration form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDzXLeKmnGTNtPREUIWcBCTxzbz7LgkrM5bxMcscWsSABqCA/viewform)

&amp;nbsp;

While I dont want to give away the exact contents, I do want you to know what type of stuff will be in it so you can pass on it if thats not your thing. I have been buying fanart stickers from Twitter group orders all year to put back for this. I have some stickers, I have a few EMW stickers (metal phone stickers), PCs, and a few other little things. The assortments will be random, although I will try to tailor to your bias if possible.

The goal was to keep these as light and cheap to mail as possible, while still giving some of you who simply cant afford to participate in the SS a little Christmas cheer also. :) This is the first year, so please be patient while we work out any bugs with it. And again, I am so sorry to have to limit it to the US. I hope next year we can open the project to other countries.

I also have another trick hiding up my sleeve, but I will have to wait until we hit the proof part of the Secret Santa before I can unveil it. :)

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you guys for your continuing support!

Sincerely, 

u/Erinzilla83",27,88
173,2017-11-7,2017,11,7,13,7bapxi,Is BTS tapping into the rock fan demographic?,thepigdidit,1510027436,"I first started noticing about a year ago that a lot of BTS fans are also rock fans. I had posted a comment on youtube about how BTS reminded me of one of my favorite rocks bands and got a ton of replies from people about them also being fans of that group or other rock bands. I'm seeing more and more comments on different forums asking for a rock concept or rock song and I keep talking to people who were not at all pop fans before BTS, but diehard fans of rock bands like Green Day. 

I have been a casual fan of kpop for a while, but have been into BTS like I've never been into any other kpop or pop artist. They managed to enter the space that is usually reserved for my favorite rock bands and the occasional singer-songwriter. Actually, what pushed me over the edge from just appreciating them as a kpop group and got me to delve into their lyrics was the Pink Floyd reference in the Fire MV. So here are some reasons why for me there is crossover appeal:

* I think they capture the spirit of rock very well in their lyrics (probably due to their hiphop influences since that's also a very anti-establishment genre), and have the perfect touch of rebel in them since their music is full of social and political commentary. But even when they do love songs, they have very poetic lyrics. 

* They also play around with androgyny, and fashion is a huge part of their image. That's something that I always loved about 70s glam rock and even some of the emo bands of the 2000s. Not to mention Page and Plant. I think BTS also has the theatricality that a lot of rock groups had, and that I find missing in genres other than pop these days. 

* BTS also writes most of their own lyrics and even produces some of their music and writes melodies. They might not play instruments, but they dance, and choreography helps them to tell their story. 

* They have really ambitious musical projects, like their series of albums. And some of their albums are pretty close to being concept albums.

* And of course they are a group of good-looking guys. As much as I love my favorite rock groups for their music, I can't deny that part of the appeal lies in how they look and present themselves.

Now, I'm not trying to say that BTS is somehow a rock group. In terms of musical influence, obviously hiphop would be the biggest. But I'm curious. Are you a rock fan who is also a fan of BTS? Do you think BTS is pulling in a lot of other rock fans?",103,98

As a K-Pop fan it's been fascinating to watch how BTS has received ever-increasing amounts of news coverage in the U.S. music industry over the past year, so I'm curious to see how that came about and whether or not there was a media effect that contributed to this rise.

Ideally, I'd like to hold the interview this weekend by phone or videochat (e.g. Skype, Google Hangouts) so that I can take notes/record the interview. Before the interview I'll send you an informed consent document to let you know what I'm doing with my research. Any mention of your responses from the interview will be completely anonymous in my paper, and I'll delete the recording once the paper is submitted.

&amp;nbsp;

As you may know, JIN is celebrating his birthday this December 4th, so we'll be starting his birthday project! Both the Jin and V birthday projects will be run at the same time. You can read the guidelines to contribute to V's birthday project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7bpx8m/vs_17_birthday_project/).

For our skim readers, we have bolded the main points and included a TL;DR at the bottom :)

&amp;nbsp;

As with all other projects, the theme is optional; we will still accept normal fan letters and fan art that has been done for each birthday so far.

**JIN's Birthday Project theme is #EatARMY**, inspired by #EatJin. We encourage you to send in food and/or recipes that you'd like to share with Jin for a cookbook-inspired project! Your submission does not strictly have to be a recipe; it can even be a memory of a comfort food for you! And, even if you can't find a way to make your submission be related to our food theme, that is totally okay! Like we said above, we will still be taking in normal fan letters and fan art :) We might also include a little flipbook-style animation of Jin and food (feel free to share any animation suggestions!) on the book.

&amp;nbsp;

##DEADLINE + OTHER INFO 

The deadline for this project is **Nov 25th, 2017 at 11:59 pm US CENTRAL time**. For those of you in [North America and Australia, here's what the deadline translates to your time zone](https://imgur.com/6m2JOxf). We're sorry we can't include each and every time zone, but if we didn't cover your time zone you can use this [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to find out the exact date and time submissions close for you. Remember to be timely with your submissions, since we will also be busy compiling the V birthday project and we will most likely not have time to accommodate late submissions. If you need to set multiple reminders for yourself, you can do one (or all) of the following:

- Comment *RemindMe! 10 days* under this post, to be reminded roughly a week before deadline. You can also do this for [any number of days before the deadline, e.g. RemindMe! 5 days or RemindMe! 12 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/2862bd/remindmebot_date_options/). 

- [View our localendar](https://www.localendar.com/public/r_bangtan) for deadline info; you can subscribe to events to be contacted about deadlines. 

- [Follow us](https://mobile.twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) on Twitter! And, make sure to enable notifications for us, so you can receive updates.

&amp;nbsp;

We will be sending out confirmation emails/PM's to double-check your submission is correct and/or to see if any changes need to be made. If you would like to be contacted about your submission, **please leave a contact** where we can reach you for these purposes, otherwise we will not contact you. This information will be kept confidential and will not affect how you chose to be credited. We will try to send a **confirmation message within a week of submission** but, depending on the volume of submissions, please understand it might take us longer. **If it has been some time, and you have not heard from us by the last week of November, please reach out to us to double-check**. We understand some of you are busy and that unexpected things happen, but we ask you guys to **please try to send your submission(s) at least a week before the deadline**. Usually, the bulk of submissions have been submitted within the last 3 days or so prior to the deadline; and, while it's not impossible to go through 40+ entries, it does set us back a bit with sending the book to print and ship. So please send your submissions with ample time before the deadline, that way we can revise and place your entry accordingly. If you know in advance or think you might be a **late submitter, let us know when we can expect your entry**; then, that way we can send you a reminder and we know to wait for your submission.

&amp;nbsp;

**The coordinators will cover all costs**, so as many of you guys can participate. We are a group of volunteering fans (not the subreddit's mods as some of you may have assumed), so if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please, [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username | JIN Project | cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name in the comment box**. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations.

&amp;nbsp;

As with all our projects, we will be making a charitable donation as our gift. Our top choice is BTS' [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), a partnership between BTS, their label, and UNICEF. However, if you have more suggestions, feel free to let us know. We will update the actual deadline within the reminder post two weeks from today; for now, **the deadline for charity donations is tentatively 11:59 pm December 2nd, 2017, US Central time**.

228,2017-11-9,2017,11,9,16,7brt9z,Wanted to ask the ARMY how BTS become so popular?,jangta,1510211832,"Hi ARMY, I'm Jason, a foreign K-pop journalist that lived in Seoul for the last 7 and a half years. I currently run an in-depth K-pop YouTube channel called Popsori and regularly do a series called ""The Rise of &lt;K-pop group&gt;"".

This next segment is on BTS.

I'm sure it's awesome for the ARMY exciting to see BTS make huge strides in just four short years. Now they're about to go on the Ellen Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live, not to mention the AMAs. I'm blown away from their achievements and proud to be both a K-pop fan and journalist covering K-pop.

After doing initial research in both English and Korean, I felt the cards were stacked against BTS from the start. For instance, from the start:

- They did not have viral hit or national song

- They didn't come from the big 3 (JYP, YG, SM)

- They didn't have a standout, famous member before their debut

- They debuted in 2013, during the EXO craze, so pretty much every other male group would be overshadowed

- They weren't big TV or variety show personalities

- They didn't come from an audition show, like Produce 101

... and so on.
(Thanks to user savingmyjams for many of these suggestions.)

I feel I need to do a bit more research and analysis though.

So I wanted to humbly give the floor to the ARMY and ask how did BTS become so popular so fast? I'm all ears (and notes too.)

Thank you in advance!",101,136

And for me, that begs the question, why are they not releasing more music videos?

This became poignant when I saw that the DNA comeback show performance of Go Go has 31 million views on YouTube. Looking at other videos, including fan lyrics and such, there are likely hundreds of millions of views out there.

There's a huge amount of people on YouTube, a free platform, that are not on Spotify or Apple Music and so get their BTS music from fan uploads. I feel like uploading low effort videos for more songs would be a good solution.

I wouldn't normally ask about this because obviously it's more work and all, but I feel like secondary and tertiary videos don't have to be super high production ventures. Just simple behind-the-scenes footage or something similar. Lyric videos even. 
(Something like Taeyeon - Cover Up, really)

I wondered if others would like to see the same, and if not, then what the reasoning is for that?

(Also, I believe a large number of these videos are claimed by BigHit, which means the fan doesn't make money, but I don't think they are monetised at all so BigHit is losing out there. And it directs attention away from the official channels which is indirect loss.)",41,31

Over on Bangtan Base, we are currently running a new awards event and we want to invite you all to participate!

ARMYs around the world create so much amazing original work and we wanted to come up with a way to celebrate the inspiring artists and creatives in our community. So we came up with the Fan Work Awards!

The award categories are split into four groups: fan art, fan fiction, Twitter and Youtube accounts, and fan sites. We are looking to find ARMY's favourite works and accounts in each of these groups, so we can celebrate their awesome contributions to our community.

**[Click here for the full list of categories and to find the voting form!](https://bangtanbase.com/topic/3233-fan-work-awards-2017/)**

We are operating open nominations, so you are welcome to vote for anyone you like in each of the categories! All sections of the form are totally optional, so you don't have to cast a vote for every award if you don't want to.

270,2017-11-11,2017,11,11,15,7c6w0l,What's the first BTS song you fell in love with?,rorschaches,1510381250,"Earlier today I clicked on an allkpop thread out of curiosity. It turned out to be an argument between two fandoms over which group was more relevant, listing stats like first week album sales, music show wins, and YouTube views to prove their point. I was about to roll my eyes and close the window when I realized: I could give you all those figures and more for BTS. 

Kpop culture makes it very easy for us to get caught up in things like YouTube views, chart positions, public recognition, etc. And it's great to see everything that the boys are accomplishing but at the end of the day, that's not the reason we fell in love with them. With all the big accolades that have been thrown at us this comeback, I wanted to remind myself of what really matters: their music. 

So in the spirit of going back to basics, I wanted to ask everyone: **what's the first BTS song you fell in love with, and why?**

For me, it was Runand by extension, the entire HYYH trilogy. I love the rock vibe of the instrumentals, and lyrics like ""it's okay to fall down, it's okay to be hurt"" were so...comforting? Also, the MV is honestly my favorite of all time, in terms of styling, color palette, and gorgeous shots like that one Jungkook scene (you know which one), the house of cards, and the pillow fight transition. There's a sense of youthful recklessness and desperation woven throughout the whole thing and it was like a punch to the gut when I first watched it. I listen to a lot of music but only a handful have ever made me feel a genuine emotion, and out of those, Run was the first that I could actively relate to. I was halfway through my first watch-through when I realized, ""Oh shit, I'm going to listen to them for the rest of my life, aren't I?""",114,77

(First post in the sub; I flipped through the rules 3 times, and hopefully this doesn't go against any of them? I apologize in advance if it does m(_ _ )m )

Thank you for the mesmerizing dance performances (and providing practice videoes). Dancing was something I never thought Id attempt, but your efforts and clean moves motivated me to give it a try. Ultimately, this pulled me out of being overweight and rebuilt my self esteem. 

Thank you for doing Japanese versions! Prior to all this, I didnt understand Korean, and I had been bs-ing my Japanese studies. Wanting to sing/rap along to your songs propelled me to sharpen my skills. I attribute my perfect score on the AP JPN exam to you. 

Thank you for all the Bomb/behind the scene/various clips. Setting them as rewards for finishing homework had virtually eradicated my stage IV procrastination symptoms. My GPA is at an all-time high. 

Thank you for creating wonderful albums. It gave me motivation to continue my part time job (to expand my collection). 

Thank you for your popularity. (Thank you, fellow ARMYs reading this reddit post; it is such a welcoming and united fandom &lt;3) I was able to make friends (with armys, and eventually other people), gain confidence through conversations, and slowly walk out of my introverted shell. 

Thank you for going all around the globe to perform! It is my dream to attend one of your concert, even if I sit on the edge of the venue. For that, I will do my best to apply to colleges, and earn enough money and status to have the freedom to do so. 

Thank you for your existence, BTS. Whether its reestablishing a long lost state of stability, or improving working efficiency by listening to your songs, or achieving my goal ACT score, or looking forward to tomorrow, or just actually enjoying my current life, thank you. Thank you for being amazing people to fall in love for. Thank you for producing catchy, meaningful, and fun songs to loop 24/7 to. Thank you for being active year round (best of luck to all the American show debuts coming up soon!!) 

Thank you for being a multilingual god, the precious, precious dad jokes, being rapping goals, Boy Meets Evil, regular snippet updates, Hwarang, and numerous covers! 

Tldr; THANK YOUUUUUUUU! 

and thank you r/bangtan for such a community to share my thoughts.

Thank you; today is a happy day.

Friends and I were discussing this and we realized that BTS is bringing over not only their talent and their music, but their fandom world as well; how it works and operates in SK.  In America, you dont see fans with light sticks or fanchants or fan paraphernalia being distributed/sold much outside the venuesits mostly just buy your ticket, see you there, scream when you feel like it. 

We already saw the major surprise everyone sitting next to BTS went through at BBMAs when the fanchants just randomly started and how everyone started clapping *for* the fandom as well most peoples faces were in shocklike wow, what is going on?!!

It was a pretty outstanding moment within the fandom, of course.  We are proud to represent our boys and chants like that is definitely something that is not very common in regards to American stars and such.  My Korean Army friends were very proud and said that they were so happy that BTS was received very warmly and also that the boys (who had announced their fears that they may not have many fans cheering them on) were treated well.  Some of them even posted stuff like: Thank you i-armys for doing what you can while we could only watch you guys did your part well!... its good to see that i-armys love and care for BTS like k-diamonds doetc.

Also, ARMY has already shown their immense pride and devotion by sending flowers and food to radio stations and this is definitely not a normal occurrence in daily American pop culture.  We're a monster to be reckoned with, if i can be honest.  Trending things in a heartbeat, translating articles, shows, mere tweets in seconds...it's all astounding and sometimes I think we move so fast the world needs to catch up.

Ive really never seen a fandom more aptly named, ARMY really we have our moments of fighting and disagreeing and all thatbut when it comes down to the line, every one of us are fiercely protective of our boys and will bond together to see their happiness come through.

That is what they think in ATRL as well (despite many of them disliking BTS). A lot of K-Pop fans may disagree with it,  but from a more neutral perspective, is there any boy group currently bigger than them right now in terms of fan base/impact/sales?

Edit: I obviously meant in a cumulative sense. Take for instance, there are local popstars probably bigger than say, Selena Gomez in their own regions but all in all, it's Selena who's the global star...not *them*. So even if an Indonesian celebrity has more specific followers than say, Halsey, the odds of them being global isn't really comparable. That's what I mean by global. Seriously, some Indonesian celebs easily have 15-20m fanclub numbers but they aren't exactly what we call global aye? ",34,57

I'll be travelling to Korea for a holiday with my 3-year-old son soon and inspired by G.C.F in Tokyo, I thought I'd make a video of our trip as a memento. This trip's especially meaningful as it'll be our first 'solo' trip without my husband.

The best song I could think of is 'Best of Me'. Do you guys have any other suggestions? Thank you in advance! &lt;3

Edit: Whoa! So many songs, so little ~~time~~ video! I'm going to compile all of the recommended songs into a playlist and listen to it whilst in Korea to see which one(s) give(s) me the most feels! THANK YOU for all the suggestions, fam! I really appreciate it! &lt;3",30,22

I've been a big fan of Def Will, a J-Pop group, for almost a year now, but I didn't know until a few months ago that one of their members was ARMY! I was on her blog today when I read a post that brought tears to my eyes. I decided to translate it for my friends, and they told me I should post it here. I think it shows a unique perspective of being both a fan and a musician that I and many others can relate to.
Here's the link to her blog post: [http://www.nylon.jp/blog/hina/?p=115](http://www.nylon.jp/blog/hina/?p=115)
I haven't studied Japanese in about a year, so my translation is probably kind of rusty. Please forgive me for my mistakes.

&gt;Good evening! It's Hina!
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday I went to the BTS Wings Tour 2017 Kyocera Dome Concert!
&gt;
&gt;From the beginning until the end, the venue was not extraordinarily hot.
&gt;
&gt;Although I went to see the summer arena performance, this addition is the first dome performance in Japan. Even in the same setlist, the weight of every single song, the weight of every single word the MC spoke-- it was completely different from last time.
&gt;
&gt;A sentence that was in a letter from a member was very real and straight: ""I was scared of being scared of every day.""
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure I am now having difficulties hard to imagine. To experience it, standing on the stage of this dome... I think that I could do it. But it would be a very emotional feeling that cannot be expressed by words, overflowing and overflowing.
&gt;
&gt;80,000 people gather to see 7 people's stages... it was a wonderful sight that I could not believe with my eyes.
&gt;
&gt;If you are like most people, you are going to be trapped inside yourself. Let's take worry and trouble as lyrics, make it music, something that can be delivered to so many people, make it echo... I think that's really amazing.
&gt;
&gt;As the members write the lyrics of the songs of BTS, I wonder what he said in the lyrics that are tied to his heart. There were a lot of things that resonated so much that helped me many times.
&gt;
&gt;Even people who look so glittering... there is a tremendous deep trouble and there is a conflict. There is suffering. But that's how they can shine like this.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe with that one lyric, with that one single song, you can change the life of a person. One of those lyrics, one single song, can give help to the people who are trying to do their best today too. There will be thousands of tens of thousands of them.
&gt;
&gt;Music that has such power is truly amazing... artists that can express it are truly amazing.
&gt;
&gt;I also want to be that kind of person.
&gt;
&gt;Become.
&gt;
&gt;I got really great energy. It was 3 hours of tears and tears in my heart. I will do my best from today as well so that I don't forget this feeling!
&gt;
&gt;See you later!",6,89

#HAPPY 150TH SURVIVOR ROUND! WOO!

Actually I wanted to celebrate the 100th round but it totally slipped my mind then. So I waited for the next pretty round number :)

We first started doing the survivors in September 2016. Can't believe it was already more than one year ago!

Soooo let's move on to today's round... welcome to the 19th round of the **b-side edition of the Choreography Survivor**! This is a game to determine which BTS dance/choreo we like best. All you have to do is **vote for the choreography you like the least**. Whichever choreography gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds. A new round ^(usually) gets posted every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

Last round, ***Concept Trailer*** was eliminated with 23% of the votes. Which choreo do you think is going out this time?

The usual rules apply: **Before submitting a post, please check to see if it should be included in one of these instead.** If the content comes from a noteworthy source, it can have its own thread. Check back often for updates!

**NOTE: We're looking for volunteers to make the compilation threads for Ellen and Jimmy Kimmel!** See [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/liveperformances) for more information. Feel free to ask us questions and shoot us a message if you're up for either one!

&gt; 1. [+2,088, -45] So proud 

&gt; 2. [+1,940, -85] BTS is the only idol album I listen to, their songs are so deep considering how young they are

&gt; 3. [+1,486, -36] Take care of your health guys~ your schedules look really busy

&gt; 4. [+1,280, -35] So jealous!!!! LA

&gt; 5. [+353, -4] I saw a video and there were so many fans gathered there... the cheers were insane... so touched

&gt; 6. [+324, -3] I saw a foreign Army tweet at Dispatch ""Dispatch-nim, please take good pictures of them""  'Dispatch-nim' international fans are so cute.

&gt; 7. [+293, -4] So grateful for the foreign fans and I know that I can depend on them. I saw them practicing their cheer chants and everything.

&gt; 8. [+126, -0] This really is just the beginning. Enjoy yourselves, guys!!!

&gt; 9. [+108, -0] So touched  I'm tearing up... please make the international Armies happy and come back safely

&gt; 10. [+107, -0] Is Dispatch really the only Korean media outlet that went overseas to report on this? This is so pathetic. I don't get why the Korean media doesn't give them the treatment they deserve because they're so scared of other agencies...",7,106

Like the big 3 companies (SM, YG, JYP) have so many artists/trainees under them that at times the companies tend to ignore some of them or give them their divided attention b/c they hav so many other things to take care of. But with BTS, BigHit doesnt hav that problem. Perhaps this has been discussed in another thread somewhere before. But being a small company and having only 1 group to take care of, its almost like BigHit as a company was made to give birth to and grow BTS...

I'm pretty sure there must be some other examples that i am not aware of. Are there other korean companies like BigHit that only have one main kpop group that brings in profit to its company?",46,42

We know that the hype this week is REAL, and we're all vibrant with anticipation; but, before the fandom has its collective meltdown, we would like to take a moment to remind you guys of Jin and Tae's birthday projects.

&amp;nbsp;


We are currently taking submissions for both projects through **25 November 11:59 pm US Central time**. [^TIMEZONE_CONVERTER](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) ^| [^NA_and_AU_timezones](https://imgur.com/6m2JOxf)

* [For Jin's project, we have a cookbook/recipes theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7bpvs2/jin_17_birthday_project). You guys can submit comfort food, your favorite recipe(s), or even just a memory of a dish you enjoyed. And if you don't have a way to tie your submission to food, that's okay! We are still taking in regular fan letters and fan art.

* Since Tae likes photography, [we are doing a photography theme for V's project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7bpx8m/vs_17_birthday_project). You can submit photos or recommend photographers that have caught your eye and that in turn you think will catch Tae's. And like with the Jin project, we will still accept regular fan submissions.

&amp;nbsp;

We would also like to address some questions about the ongoing Secret Santa and the upcoming census.

**Secret Santa -** This is our first year running a SS for the sub, and so far so good yay! A lot of people have been asking us if we can still wiggle them in. Unfortunately, no. We have sent out Secret Santa matches ^(P.S. participants check your emails and PMs!) so we can't accept new participants for this year. However, we hope to expand the sub's Secret Santa for next year and we would be more than happy to have you guys join us :)

**2017 Census -** Can you guys believe it's almost December? We're prepping to run this year's census and can't wait to see how much the sub has grown. Please be on the look out for the guidelines and the volunteers post!! ^(*Hobi scream*)

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, that's it for now. It's D - 1 guys! strong power thank you!! I gotta go find my ARMY Bomb

The 2017 American Music Awards will be held in the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California, USA and will be broadcast live in the United States on the TV network ABC. Red Carpet starts at 6PM EST, show begins at 8PM EST, and ends at approximately 11:00PM EST. [List of announced performers so far.](https://www.theamas.com/2017-performers/)

#Where To Watch/Stream Links   

******

##For those in the USA with Cable:  

If you are in the USA and have cable, you can watch the RED CARPET on E! starting at 6pm EST, and the MAIN SHOW on ABC starting at 8pm EST. ABC should be around channel 7 (more or less), as its a local channel.  

**Note:** It might not be listed as ABC in the channel guide (for me [I have Comcast Xfinity] it was listed like WJLA or something but it IS in fact ABC, with the ABC logo in the corner and everything lol).  

* There is also an [ABC live stream on their website](http://abc.go.com/watch-live) if you have no actual television around you, however you will need to log in to verify your cable subscription. There are some geographical restrictions though.  

* You might also be able to stream it on your computer by logging into your account for your cable provider and using the **Live TV** option that livestreams channels you have access to. I know this is possible with Comcast, as I've tried it, but there should be similar options for other providers. I've also seen some things about live streaming ABC through Hulu with a free trial?    

* E! has a [live stream of the red carpet on their website](http://www.eonline.com/now/live), again you need to sign in using your cable provider to make it work (click on the video and it'll prompt you to sign in)  

*****

##For International viewers/those without cable:

* ***OFFICIAL RED CARPET TWITTER LIVE STREAM (starts at 6pm EST):***  https://twitter.com/i/live/927621997386858496 

* The show/red carpet ~might~ also be airing on E!, TNT, or TLC internationally, check your local listings.  

**Other Streams:**  

[some of these have possible viruses etc, so be wary when clicking on them! strongly suggest adblock]

So before we even got into the venue, so much happened. When my friend and I first got to LA Live, there were SO MANY ARMYS there. Literally, both sides of the street were crowded by hordes of ARMY, most of whom were equipped with giant meme faces of the boys. My personal favorite was a cut out of Namjoon, holding his hand out for a handshake, and it said dont worry Namjoon Ill shake your hand. I really feel like more than half of the people there tonight were there for BTS, there were so many ARMY. 

After walking by the crowd, my friend and I got in line, and maybe thirty minutes go by and I looked up and here comes Hobeom walking down the street. I had seen him at the BBMAs, so I immediately knew it was him. But Hobeom wasnt the only member of the staff we saw outside of the venue. We were moving inside, and all of a sudden a Korean man in a black and white striped sweater ran by me, and it was freaking Sungdeuk! As he ran by me, he brushed my arm a little bit and I told my friend that I felt like I could suddenly dance  

Fast forward to going through security and getting into the theater. We were on the second floor of the venue, and we could see onto the red carpet. All of a sudden here comes BTS to get interviewed by Laura Morano. The screams were seriously deafening you guys. It was madness. All of the muggles were so confused, and it was honestly so great   

I was actually surprised at how good my seat was. I was expecting to not be able to see the stage, but I could see everything so clearly, so that was a nice surprise. Basically the entire top section was filled with ARMY. My entire row all had army bombs. 

I was sitting down for maybe 15 minutes, when all of a sudden there was ear splitting screaming and here comes BTS, going to their seats. Even from the nosebleeds, they looked absolutely amazing. 

There were a few notable moments from them sitting in the audience. At one point Yoongi had left the seating area, and when he came back everyone went apeshit. He kind of stopped in his tracks and looked kind of stunned that we were so loud for him just coming back. It was great  
During Shawn Mendes performance, Hoseok kept playing the air guitar and it was honestly adorable. He was probably the most energetic when it came to dancing to the other performers. Surprising, I know /s. 
Finally, during one of the commercial breaks, inside the venue they played an ad for the BTSxAMAs merchandise, and once again the screaming was crazy. After the ad finished, Seokjin stood up and faced us and blew a kiss in the direction of the fans. Hes such a gem, what did we do to deserve Kim Seokjin. 

They left the seating area before Christina Aguilera performed, but before they left they made sure to wave to us, because theyre the best. 

Fast forward again to when Kelly Clarkson was performing. You could see the top of BTS set so we knew they were performing next. I had butterflies in my stomach, I was so excited and nervous for them to perform.  Its really a shame that the fan chants didnt really come through on television, because they were SO loud. Like, it was hard to hear the boys signing, thats how loud they were. To be completely honest with you guys, I dont really remember the performance at all. I was so focused on remembering the fan chant, and yelling loudly, that I didnt take the time to soak it all in. I mostly remember the end, when they boys stood and the end of the stage and waved to the audience and then Hoseok bowed and it was honestly so endearing. After that, they left the stage and that was that:) 
(Edit: after there were done performing I was literally so proud, I was about to cry. But then I had to remind myself I had non waterproof makeup on )

I really apologize for this whole thing being so disjointed. Its taken me a few hours to be able to organize my thoughts on the night. It was seriously such an amazing experience, and Im so happy to have been there for the boys American television debut. Im having post DNA depression hardcore right now, and I really need them to come back and perform a show in the US. Im really so ecstatic to see where BTS goes from this point, because tonights performance is only going to open doors for them. ",33,330

&gt;1. [+1,634, -36] Apparently they sang along in Korean, is that true...

&gt;2. [+1,490, -35] I got goosebumps hearing the foreigners chant along. They showed a clip of the audience and everyone was shouting BTS.

&gt;3. [+1,272, -33] So, so amazing. I'm not even a fan but I think I'll become one after seeing how good they were while watching live.

&gt;4. [+1,147, -32] Their stage was amazing and the crowd reaction was daebak too, so proud of them 

&gt;5. [+248, -4] The best ever American debut yet. This pretty much marks their worldwide debut  we're going to get so much more Armies...

The whole AMA hype had me thinking, there's bound to be *a shit ton* of new fans who are going to go back and listen to all of BTS' old songs and watch their performances, and it got me a little excited that some people will be exposed to their MAMA/MMA performance last year for the first time, among many others. 

I think for me BST will go down as one of their most legendary tracks, even well above other title songs like DNA and Fire, only because I think it was something completely unprecedented for BTS (normally ballads and fucking bangers) as well as the breathtaking performances (all the styling, stages, the choreo) that went with it.

I still audibly gasp whenever I hear *nae pittam nunmul*, as Jimin's head rises.",38,90

Another of her friends who went to the AMAs tried to buy them soju but they didnt let her either. 

Anyways I hope they had a really fun time hanging out with each other afterwards and tbh Im kinda glad they spent time together instead of going to wild parties (even though imagining the interactions with other artists is pretty entertaining). ",20,143

Yet very few artists can pull off stadium tours and I dont think that BTS is there yet in the US. For instance, Taylor Swifts $250 million 1989 world tour was largely held in arenas. This time, her reputation tour will be a stadium one. Justin Biebers Purpose tour was a mix of large stadiums but a lot of smaller arenas, too. 

There arent a lot of mid size venues. It seems arena (15K-22K) or stadiums (50-90k). Its harder for the artist to do several smaller tours but riskier to book only a few large venues. 

Where do you think the concerts will take place here in the US or abroad?

These past few days have really amped up my already intense appreciation for BTS so i'd really like to take a minute to commend them - especially Kim Namjoon.  He is definitely MVP of the next few years...stepping gracefully into the roles of translator, hyung, leader and company representative, sometimes in the span of a few seconds.  I just want to step on the brakes and give this wonderful, wonderful, talented man a hug.  I was in awe watching all those red carpet interviews.  He held his cool, he was calm, he was happy and most importantly, he was engaging.  He gave up the mic to the boys and stepped back to allow them to answer what they could through their rough english and he smiled so brightly and proudly....The whole entire interviews, i just watched Joon because it's hard not to.  He executed their strength and bond as a group so well - deferring to them all for opinions (even when he knew their answers) instead of just answering in english in the quickness. Namjoon is clearly the pillar of strength and comfort and the boys draw from him constantly. This is a perfect time for those ""You're doing great, sweetie"" memes.  He has managed to divert questions and dodge dumb ones tactfully and given such humble answers, always never forgetting the fanbase. My heart feels nigh to bursting each time he proudly thanks us and tells us to love ourselves.  I'm feeling such an overwhelming adoration for Namjoon in the U.S. thus this is the reason i'm starting this thread...just so we can all share our thoughts on how much we adore and appreciate him as a leader, as an artist, as a person. 

He's always demonstrated the leader role well in SK, but its awesome how much more it shines here, in the US, when they are out of their elements.  Namjoon is one of those rare people that others just gravitate to for advice or decision making regardless of age and/or status and he's proving that every single time he opens his mouth.  Sometimes i think...if this man wasn't an idol, he'd still be some kind of reformation leader.

Of course, he had his nervous and cringey moments (and even those are endearing as heck), but when it was a question he liked, his whole face lit up and his dimples shined through.  One interview i really loved was when he explained that BTS is like a gift box...and i couldn't agree with that analogy more because they really have been gifting us with their music and messages from day one.  They're unapologetically raw and genuine.

I just do not have enough words for the presence of Kim Namjoon.  There are going to be many more interviews and radio shows and tv shows but its reassuring to know that we have a leader who is genuine and caring and knows how to present BTS as a whole.

Also, applause for the boys who must feel like a cheese plate in the middle of a mice farm, everyone ogling and commenting, thirsting and vying for their attention plus the extra-ness of us ARMYs supporting and encouraging everything along the way... This is only the beginnings of a wild ride, guys ;)",41,292

It was honestly an exhausting process, but I felt a necessary one. 

It's 3500+ words, so you're in for a ride.

Things that got to me especially -

- RM appreciating how they were just part of the fam at the AMAs, rather than the exotic 'Other' 
- The boys respecting the company respecting them
- Tae saying that there are past lyrics and beats that seem embarrassing now, but that he still appreciates them because they were 100% sincere at the time
- Yoongi only wanting to do music up to the point people enjoy his work and regard it well ..... but wanting that to be for a long, long time
- RM and Suga doing a whole spiel on how all seven boys care only for the group, then Hobi being like WELL I'M RELEASING A MIXTAPE oo ps (I kid, I kid) 
- Generally, RM's thoughtfulness and anxiety coming through in a way that shines


**Edit**: I'm silly. 'Bogu' = Vogue, and I at one point wrote they doubled their followers from 500,000 to 1 million in six months sorry, obviously meant 5 million to 10 million. ",92,254

Someone also commented that if we wanted to crack the Top 50, the US general public needs to like it to some degree. 

Big Hit seems serious in ensuring the song charts high with all the promo and hyping they are currently doing, considering the remix is not really part of an album but has an MV. They even changed the release date to ensure optimum charting chances. 

I currently dont see ARMYs talking much about ensuring it charts high, do you think ARMYs have become complacent that radio will play it due to the boys giving out interviews to stations?  But I know lots of artists who give out interviews but never get airplay. it is not an assurance. I know ARMY is a streaming powerhouse but are there any projects and goals currently put for the Mic Drop release?

I teach 3rd to 5th grade special education.  I have nine amazing students.  We do movement breaks often because many of them have ADHD or sensory disorders.  We use gonoodle.com, which has guided dance exercise videos made for kids.  

For weeks I've wanted to play a BTS  choreography video.  Wouldn't it be sooo cool to see them doing BTS' s choreo?   I will take *any* opportunity I can to give them the chance to feel proud and develop self esteem.  

I played Illegal/dimple in the way to Special Olympics.   The 3 kids and paraeducator in my car LOVED it!  We were all dancing in the car.  They thought it was so catchy and it pumped us up for soccer!  :)   DNA's choreo video is the only one PG-rated enough to do at school that I found so far.  Any suggestions?  EXO's The Eve is exactly NOT the kind of choreo video I could show at school.  :P

One thing that baffled me about Dimples from first listen was that wicked run before the last chorus, actually at the beginning of the last chorus.

Did JK always come up with firey runs like that? I was aware he likes to play around with vocal runs but like, what was that? Also, do you think there wasn't any modification made in it? I don't think it's bad if there is. I just want to clear this off my mind.",52,48

While I 100% prefer their self-produced variety work, I do miss some of the silly things BTS did back before they blew up and became semi-unapproachable (think Knowing Bros.

For example, I really want to know if Red Velvet is still a BTS household fave, and I'd love to see BTS to Weekly Idol's Show Me The Credit Card relay. What about you all?",101,53

I recall when DNA dropped there was a streaming guide/graphic that was floating around to help people understand how to support it, so I'd like to make one for MIC Drop as well! I have some ideas and knowledge on the subject, but there are plenty of people here who know much more than I do, so I'm looking for suggests to put on it! I'm going to be sharing draft updates and similar on here!

Here are some of the ideas I have already:

&gt; **CHARTING**

To get on the charts, the Billboard charts take into account radio play and streaming play, including streaming the MV. I've also heard it will treat the original and the remix as one, but I don't remember the source for that, so if someone could find it I'll include it. 

I know vaguely how YouTube, Spotify, and iTunes streaming works, but I heard there are special limitations, especially on YouTube, that counts as a stream. Something about how many times you can view something for your views to count. I'd like the guide to specify how to avoid this, and to also help get it on trending. Also, how much likes and comments matter, and what the spam filter catches.

Regarding radio play, now that BTS has an official US licensor the only thing in our way is *telling radio stations to play it*. This is probably easier said than done, so if anyone knows how to get this done then please share! If I recall, you can do that via the iHeartRadio site. Would having a list of confirmed stations playing the song be a good thing to add?

&gt; **TALK SHOWS**

I'm thinking of adding a blurb talking about legal streaming of Ellen and Jimmy Kimmel to support those videos legally to encourage more companies to have them perform and for those videos to also trend and promote BTS. I don't know if that should be put on there, or if it should be mentioned at all.

&gt; **ANYTHING ELSE**

Any other content that you think should be on there is welcome! 

&gt; **IMAGES/DRAFTS**

* [**Draft 1**](https://i.imgur.com/ZdesAsf.jpg) - this is a sample of the header for the general aesthetic I'm going for. It's going to be scrollable.

I'm using just official images; this one is from one of their lives. Image suggestions are welcome (I was thinking of using the Spotify playlist pictures but Tae needs to update his for it to actually spell ""MIC DROP"") to spruce up the content, but everything needs clear/readable. Content is top priority!

Thank you so much in advance for your help!

**UPDATE:**

Computer crashed and the graphic was lost. I'm thinking of revamping it to a YouTube specific guide since most other stuff is covered. Pouring through my autosave files as I type this!",9,39

There aren't many fans around where I live, but I'm constantly promoting the group to other people. I'd love to get more involved with projects, events, and other happenings and hang out/meetup with/ and talk to people who also are supporters of BTS.

Is it against any rules to use this thread to list various fan groups that new (or old!) fans can join? Maybe we can make lists depending on country, regions, states, etc. so that people can find ones closest to them. ",19,39

Regardless I have a few points here that I want people to ponder about and would like your thoughts on.

* Apparently there's a notion that trap = bad and the genre of beat in the remix was too Americanized, and thus, worse. Do you agree?

* The English verses found a polarizing reception. Issues pointed out include being cringe, unnatural slang, childish lyrics, lack of oomph and effect in the original. Taking in mind the places bts spent time in when in the U.S.(condition included to consider slangs or natural patterns of speech) do you agree with the brought up criticism? Do you have more criticism to add?

* The Steve Aoki remix didn't add more to the original. Do you agree?

* Do you think the EDM influences added as a result of Steve Aoki's contributions weren't a smart choice for MIC Drop? Do you agree with the notion that EDM stripped MIC Drop of the positive qualities it originally brought to the table?

* A commonly observed notion is that the remix was made to cater to the general U.S.audience, and thus it cannot be expected to be embraced by normal army, as well as lacked the quality bts usually delivers. Taking into consideration that two U.S.based artists contributed to the track (and thus will arguably make the track more Americanized by nature), do you agree with the notion that the remix was solely made as a  'muggle bait'?

* Taking into consideration the above criticism and any other critique you may have found, what strengths do you think the remix possessed or where do you think the remix did well?


These points were brought up to discuss the MV version remix, however, you're free to add thoughts about the Desiigner feature version to your reply as well.

If there's something you didn't like about the remix, or if you disagree with a certain criticism, please try to be specific. A simple 'THE REMIX WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! THE ORIGINAL WAS HYPE!' or 'THIS REMIX IS LIT! I'VE BEEN SLAYN!' won't do.",134,87

But wouldn't you think that releasing this remix is an attempt to gain more traction in America? The song is with a popular American rapper and is mostly in English. They did say it was a song for fans but the way Aoki, Desiigner and BigHit were hyping it makes it seem like it was more. Plus,  making a song in English when most fans rather their songs be in Korean. They are also debuting the song an major shows. Also there are rumors of them having a U.S. label. So do you think BigHit is definitely trying their hand in the American market? Is it a good idea in your opinion? What kind of success can you see them having if that is in fact BH's goal?",53,31

I don't think we'll see Bighit debuting another group very soon, but I can't help but speculate what they will be like when they debut.

So I have a few questions for you guys, it's mainly about geeking out on this and speaking hypothetically, because as we know Bighit all of our speculations about a new group will most likely be false lol. But still, let's have some fun with the idea:

 (why) would you prefer a girl group or a boy group? How many members?

 what will be the main premise of the group? what kind of concepts would you like to see them try?

 Do you wish to see a resemblance to their brother group BTS or would it be better if they went a different direction?

 How much do you think their popularity will benefit from BTS'? 

 How popular could they hypothetically become? Has Bighit found the formula for a successful group or was it more that they got lucky with BTS and every other group they debut will either be hit or miss?

 What kind of interactions between the two groups would you be most excited about? 
(I'm picturing J-Hope teaching them to dance)

 How big will your expectations be when Bighit finally debuts another group? How unbiased do you think you'll be?

996,2017-11-26,2017,11,26,6,7fi5p1,Introductory Song Discussion for showing BTS to NON-KPOP/ARMY friends,fluffyburritos,1511645520,"Thanks to BTS absolutely killing it this year I've been seeing a lot more people, both friends irl and strangers online, becoming interested and wanting to learn who they are. While I've been doing my best to convert friends, many online posts are of people recommending their own favorite songs to others, which can be a big mistake in my opinion. Sometimes our favorite BTS songs might not fit the particular accepted narrative when it comes to sexuality and its portrayal of men and Asian men. In particular, I've been seeing one song getting recommended the most, and I think it is statistically probably the worst song to show a westernized audience. (I'm speaking as a straight male living in Southern California, so obviously my experiences might not be relevant to people outside the US or even in the US.)

What song am I talking about? ""Blood, Sweat, and Tears"". 

Yes we all love the singing, dancing, and visuals in the MV, but unless your friends are already very familiar with the kpop male-beauty aesthetic, East Asian beauty standards, or just very, *very* open to the portrayal of male sexuality in general, this is probably not the ideal video to show them first. 

Please do not let your admiration cloud rationality. The key factor is to **tailor** your recommendations to your individual friends' tastes and proclivities. 

YOU are your friend's gateway into ARMY and kpop but if you let your blind love hinder your judgement you may very well turn them off from kpop in general as if that wasn't already easy enough. Please take into consideration whatever knowledge you have of your friend/audience and use that to determine what to show them. 

Got dancer friends? Show them any of the dance practices or mv's with lit choreo (SBS showcase, Dope, Baepsae, Fire). Show them Boy Meets Evil. Then again if they are dancers you can probably show them BST..

Hiphop friends? Show them Mic Drop Remix and Mic Drop, then RM/AgustD stuff (Do You, Joke, Change, Give it to me, then AgustD after because.. S-T-D..)

Typically for regular muggles with very Westernized tastes (California) a good introductory order has been: 

1. Not Today/Dope (For non-Asian friends I usually show them Dope first because the costumes make them easier to differentiate, then I point out their favorites from Dope in Not Today if they had any)
2. Mic Drop Remix/Fire (Bangers)
3. Save Me/Spring Day (These showcase the softer sides they can portray. Personally, Save Me is what made me fall in love with their voices, after becoming a fan of Not Today/Dope/Fire for the dancing. Spring Day is also very good, with harder rap lines)
4. At this point I ask them what **they** want to see. Usually the requests have been to see more dancing. [SBS Performance Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2rS6vXApF0) usually gets the most positive reactions (LIIIITT) then any of the songs from 1 and 2  dance practices or live performances get great reactions as well. 

Sometimes they want to see interviews so I'll show them [this KBS special interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqlLES_i5rk) because it's IN KOREAN WITH SUBTITLES which does a *much* better job at portraying their individual eloquence and personalities so much more than any of their interviews in America. If you've watched any of the American interviews you'll have noticed that the boys' attempts at the same humor get lost in translation for people who aren't already familiar with the way they joke around. IMO watching interviews in their native language with (good) subtitles is much better. Then when they're ready for US interviews I show them the [J-14 interview with Liam McEwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7rXl8uuUTY) and [The Mess interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOlILeeulx0) because McEwan does his research on them as reflected in his questions, and has great energy with them, and The Mess interview was the only one where I really saw them get to be themselves on American soil and have fun. 

OBVIOUSLY THIS LIST IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I USE AND IT WON'T WORK FOR EVERYONE. I'll repeat again, the key factor is to **tailor** your recommendations to your individual friends' tastes and proclivities. 

Also I stole this link from /u/lu-mitzy, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UagXHUrroU) is probably the best version of BST to show anyone for the first time. Just one straight shot of them front-on and they all look ungodly at 4k. 

Thank you for reading and please don't take this the wrong way as an attack on ANY of their songs or styles, I want nothing more than to see our boys and ARMY succeed globally, but I've noticed that this is a legitimate issue that needs to be in the conscious minds of ARMYs everywhere. Especially for those living in America, overrun with men reveling in toxic masculinity (as much as I hate that phrase) and both men and women indulging in being closed-minded to anything that doesn't fit their narrow acceptable aesthetic.

It's around this time of year again, and that means CENSUS TIME! With the permission of the mods, last year we ran the census and the first 'boy meets /r/bangtan' project ([final book](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/) and [full results](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5sjwn5/census_results_2016/)). This year, we are once again running the census and book project, 'boy meets /r/bangtan' 2017 edition. Considering the huge increase in subscribers and everything which has happened in 2017, this will be a very exciting year and census!

Before we begin, we've extended the deadline for submissions for the Jin and V to 28 Nov! Please see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7fe3q0/deadline_extension_for_jin_and_v_projects_1159pm/) for more details and we'd welcome all submissions! We will also make a special announcement regarding the Secret Santa tomorrow, so be on the lookout for that. 

This is a pretty long post, so there is a tl;dr at the end for our skim readers. 

&amp;nbsp;


#What is the census and 'boy meets /r/bangtan?

For those who are new to /r/bangtan, we conduct a subreddit [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census) every year to have an idea of who we all are (and to get that sweet, sweet I.N.T.E.R.N.A.L. D.A.T.A). We conducted the 'boy meets /r/bangtan' project for the first time last year because in many respects, there are limited opportunities for us i-fans to show the ways in which the members have touched and affected the lives of fans all around the world, from different walks of life and circumstances. Through the census and census book project, we feel that even in some small way, we can show the extent of their impact, even if it's just our little community, and share the things that we as a community love about them. 

&amp;nbsp;


#Census info and questions

The census itself will be completely anonymous. We have published the questions here in advance in case there are mistakes or corrections that need to be made. 

The questions are the same questions from last year with a few minor updates. The current list of questions is [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-h0QA5QJNK5XLHzf4) and will be asked through Google forms. In summary, there will be the following types of questions: 

&amp;nbsp;

**Multiple choice or checklist style questions**: (compulsory for responders) 
 
* demographic questions 
* questions relating to discovery and consumption of BTS / kpop 
* questions relating to use of /r/bangtan  
* questions regarding bias and favourite song/album/mv/choreo.  
 
**Short answer questions**: (non-compulsory for responders)  
 
* favourite BTS memory  
* favourite things about BTS and each member

We will also ask a question about favourite performances in the discussion thread (see below). 
 
The style of how each question will be asked is listed in the link above.  

&amp;nbsp;
 
The census this year will be run from approximately **0.00 am 1 Dec to 11.59 pm 14 Dec KST**. The results of the census will be posted as soon as possible after analysis of short answer questions. If there is time and interest, correlations and further analytics on the data may be run.   
 
Any questions, comments or other feedback on the census and the questions and their inclusion in the census book would be greatly welcomed and appreciated! We would rather address these issues in advance rather than on the day.  
 
We hope that everyone can participate in answering the census! 

&amp;nbsp;

#The census book 'boy meets /r/bangtan'

What the census book will look like is something similar to last years (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/)). 

Like last year, we will not be including all the data in the census book.  For example, we will not include the 'who is your bias' question in the final copy of the book, and we will also truncate the options in the 'how do you obtain BTS music' question, as described in the questions list. The inclusion or exclusion of certain questions in the book is still up for discussion, and we welcome your comments and feedback. In the same sense, note that certain things in the census book may only be released as a ranked list without percentages etc. However, the results of all the census questions will be released separately to the sub (including analysis of the short answer questions). 

Otherwise, the content of the census book would consist mainly of the census data, accompanied by illustrations/infographics. We would also like to include some longer responses and comments elaborating on the questions and responses received in the census, so as to provide reasons and commentary as to why we like certain things.  

Since the census form itself is not really suited for this kind of submission, and to also credit people without violating the anonymity of the census, we will be running a separate thread for comments that may be included in the book (e.g. why is this your favourite song? Elaborate more on your favourite BTS memory or favourite thing about a member). The thread would be run at the same time as the census (i.e. 0am 1 Dec  11.59pm 14 Dec KST). We would contact you about inclusion of your comment in the book and ask for permission for use, as well as the form you would prefer to be credited in (for both physical and e-book copy, see below).  

We will run the thread similarly to like that of last year's thread: see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5frd1d/bts_projects_discussion_thread_boy_meets_rbangtan/). We will also be asking expanding on some additional questions e.g. How did you find out about BTS? Tell us about your experience!; From what era have you been a BTS fan? Tell us a about your fan experience!; Have you been to a BTS concert/fanmeet/live event? Tell us about your experience!; Do you know/are you learning Korean? Has BTS influenced you in any way regarding this? etc. 

In addition to sending a hard copy version to the boys, we will also provide an e-copy for /r/bangtan. There likely will be some small variations between the two versions, for privacy and other concerns.  

&amp;nbsp;

#Funding 
 
As we really would like a project that the whole subreddit can participate in, the BTSprojects team has decided that we will cover the price of the book + shipping.  

We are a group of volunteering fans (not the subreddit's mods as some of you may have assumed), so if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please, [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username | Census Project | cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name in the comment box**. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations.

As with all our projects, we will be making a charitable donation as our gift with any excess monies. Our top choice is BTS' [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), a partnership between BTS, their label, and UNICEF. However, if you have more suggestions, feel free to let us know.

**We would really like to emphasize again that NO financial donation or any other kind of donation is necessary to participate in this project.** Even though donations are appreciated, the BTSprojects team will cover the whole project costs because we really want as many people to participate as possible.  

&amp;nbsp;

#Illustrations/Art 

Please see the [book last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/) for some of the amazing illustrations from artists from this subreddit! 

Our envisaged illustration style for the census book is clean line / ink-style drawings, mostly black and white with a splash of colour. We would love to have the illustrators and fanartists of this subreddit take part, so please PM us if you would like to help out with this project! All kinds of art are accepted (digital, hand-drawn, etc.). [**Here**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-h0YsLaphqvJykAUT) is the link to the briefing and some FAQ [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gR027oG8AcYbfq5B)

Please note that we are also open to other types of illustrations dependent on whether we get sufficient volunteers e.g. favourite thing/performance of BTS, favourite song, MV etc. Please PM us with your concept and we'll discuss it from there. 

Please reply to messages as soon as possible! Though we are currently giving assignments on a first come, first served basis, your assignment will be lost if you do not respond within a week after our assignment of members. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Translation 
 
If you know Korean and are willing / able to translate, we would greatly appreciate any amount of help that you can give! Ideally, we would like to translate at least all the questions and census data, as well as the introduction and conclusion. Please PM us if you are available and would like to help!

&amp;nbsp;


#Other 
 
If you are available during December and would like to get involved with the project, please send us a PM!

I thought DNA was more of an EDM Funk thing, which sounds nothing like Bubblegum in my opinion? Isn't Bubblegum Pop more like SNSD's 'Oh!'? The visual concept also doesn't make me think bubblegum, closer to like something from the 90s, which I can totally buy lol.

So why are people calling it bubblegum? Did I label the genre incorrectly? I'm sorry lol. I guess I'm kind of confused.

Edit: To clarify, just in case, I don't have anything in particular against Bubblegum Pop. I actually enjoy the genre when I stumble on it. I think it's like labelling Kit Kats as Galaxy Chocolates. I love both chocolates to death, but I wouldn't like someone calling a Kit Kat bar a Galaxy flute :x",30,26

Mine would have to be [""Eat Jin + chimchim + kook""](http://www.vlive.tv/video/18956?channelCode=FE619) from last year. Source of the ""Stahb it!"" meme, it starts off derpy with Jin &amp; Jimin doing an EatJin with candy, and it turns into a ridiculous hot mess when Jungkook shows up.

Please try to keep these to things they have publicly posted or talked about in public settings (avoid defamation/rumors/actually negative things etc). I'd rather not get banned lol.

To start, this is not that pervy but it's gotta be one of my favorite 1'20s on the Internet: the boys goofing around in their hotel room, and Jimin accidentally exposed himself. Bless BigHit for actually publishing this and even putting a Bangtan Bomb as the censor image lol: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNfRVWGi-YQ

Other than that, there's a video I saw of Jimin interviewing Tae while poking his mic at Tae in a very suggestive way while giggling knowingly with the camera person... Not sure where I saw it though.",115,130

After Vapp live-broadcasting of the concert was announced, a hashtag that asks to cancel the live broadcasting is now trending in Korea. Some Korean fans are wondering how on earth that hashtag can be trending so easily, while hashtags encouraging voting never get trended. Anyway, K-army on DC gallery are worrying and feeling sorry that such selfish hastag is trending while i-lovelies have been so much devoted and helpful for us. So, they are asking fans to upload the following text on places where i-armys can see. the following is not written by me. It is from a Korean website for BTS fans ( DC gallery).  

""We are sorry you had to see that hashtag. Just to clear things up, that hashtag is NOT the majority opinion of K-Army, and in fact most of us think it's selfish and short thought. We appreciate what International ARMYs are always doing, and we're also excited for the live broadcast!""",11,145

I just wanted to create a thread for people from other cultures/languages to talk about being an army coz i know BTS gets translated into so many other languages aside from just korean to english

It has been stated many times by critics tht a lot of BTS fans are not multi-fandom, in tht they dont follow kpop but rather they just follow BTS. Although i do think there might be some ARMY that are multi-fandom, still i find it fascinating tht being an ARMY is like a movement of its own, its something tht hasn't been done before. 

It would be nice if we could all come together to show the effect of this movement to the world by doing some sort of grand, positive project that shows our cumulative power to everyone. It could be something as simple as having a hashtag trending worldwide for a good cause. If it's powerful enough, the world would take notice and report on it. But I also think talking about our positive experiences and interactions with each other would be a good 1st step. If you do hav any ideas, pls. share ARMYs from all over the world

What do you tell them?,strahberry,1511980912,"With all the small interactions I've seen them have with US Army lately, I've been wondering what I would want to say to my bias if I was randomly called on the phone by them (hopeless daydreamer here), like Jungkook and his cute stan during the Seacrest interview, or if I met them very briefly at a fan event. 

Please share two things you would tell them if given the opportunity, the catch is it has to be brief/concise because you don't have much time! You are free to do one for each member if you're ot7 or because you simply want to and have the time to :) 

For now, I'll stick to just my bias because it took me an hour to figure out what I'd say and to do the others I'd need another 6 hours xD 

I'd tell Jimin 


1) That his singing is incredibly moving to me and millions of others. He really exceeded his goal. 


2) I'd ask him to continue staying true to himself and living bravely. &lt;3 



Edit: So, what I've learned from this thread is that BTS continue to make ARMY more and more bulletproof with each passing day. And that's a beautiful thing &lt;3 I can only hope that we make them feel even just a little bit more secure about themselves and the paths they've chosen. ",89,54

&amp;nbsp;
 
Please use the discussion thread to expand on answers given in the census! In the census book, we would also like to include some longer responses and comments elaborating on the questions and responses received in the census, so as to provide reasons and commentary as to why we like certain things. Since the census form itself is not really suited for this kind of submission, and to also credit people without violating the anonymity of the census, we will be running a separate thread for comments that may be included in the book 

Please only answer the census ONCE per person. Note that because we are starting the data collating process whilst the census is ongoing, it will not be possible to edit census responses after you submit the form.  

&amp;nbsp;
 
For reference, the list of questions is [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-h0QA5QJNK5XLHzf4). In short, the types of questions asked will be. 
 
&gt; Multiple choice or checklist style questions: (compulsory for responders)  
&gt; 
&gt; * demographic questions  
&gt; * questions relating to discovery and consumption of BTS / kpop  
&gt; * questions relating to use of /r/bangtan   
&gt; * questions regarding bias and favourite song/album/mv/choreo.   
 
&gt; Short answer questions: (non-compulsory for responders)   
&gt;  
&gt; * favourite BTS memory   
&gt; * favourite things about BTS and each member   

&amp;nbsp;
 
Please see the discussion thread for the questions asked there.  
 
Please let us know ASAP if you notice any issues with the survey. Feel free to ask questions, give feedback etc in the comments below. If you have any issues or questions to do with the discussion thread, please ask them here in this post. We want to leave the discussion post free for comments answering the questions only.  
 
Results will be posted as soon as possible.  
 
A big thank you to everyone who volunteered for artwork/illustration, translating, and for other help for the project so far! If you still want to submit an artwork, help with translation to Korean or help in any other way, it's not too late! Send us a PM.

Please use the discussion thread to expand on answers given in the census! In the census book, we would also like to include some longer responses and comments elaborating on the questions and responses received in the census, so as to provide reasons and commentary as to why we like certain things. Since the census form itself is not really suited for this kind of submission, and to also credit people without violating the anonymity of the census, we will be running a separate thread for comments that may be included in the book.

If you haven't completed the census already, the post for the census is [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7gmk2s/rbangtan_census_2017_open_0_am_1_dec_to_1159_pm/) and the census survey form is [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8wHBShX1ZnYytMYt8tcMwMmbfJDV-8VPCbCfrUkmjcGySqw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Please only answer the census ONCE per person. Note that because we are starting the data collating process whilst the census is ongoing, it will not be possible to edit census responses after you submit the form.  
 
If you have a question, issue or feedback regarding this discussion thread, please post it in the census thread [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7gmk2s/rbangtan_census_2017_open_0_am_1_dec_to_1159_pm/), do **NOT** post it in this discussion thread. We want to reserve this thread for comments answering the discussion questions only.  
 
We will try to include as many comments as possible in the group from as many people as possible. Please note that we will PM you about how you would prefer to be credited in the census book. You may be credited by your real name, pseudonym, Reddit username or other username, initials, any other suitable method, or you may choose to remain anonymous; this credit goes for both physical book and e-copy.  
 
This thread will be in contest mode for the duration of the census and we will be accepting comments from **0.00 am 1 Dec  11.59 pm 14 Dec 2017** ^((this thread has been posted slightly early due to coordinator availability)^) . **Please use the upvote system as you would for a regular discussion thread.** 
 
Please note that the final criteria for inclusion in the book is not based on upvotes only; the first criterion is relevance to census data, and other criteria include succinctness (to aid in translation), the inclusion of as many different commenters as possible and community sentiment (upvotes). 

Please try to make your answers relatively short! This is to aid us in translation. Please try to limit responses to 2-3 sentences (~30 words).
