So, today I decided to go and screenshot every word that I was able to find in the new MV for ""Run"", since some of them may still provide clues. Here's a link to the album with screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/V1n8T

What I see throughout the MV, after reading all the writings on the walls, is the opposition between two concepts: the ""Carpe diem, enjoy the moment"" concept, and the ""Youth is never coming back"" concept. There's also conflict between ""Nevermind, take it easy"" and ""Don't trust"", as well as between ""I regret nothing"" and ""Life is painful"". I think that the members are lost between the two perspectives; youth is beautiful and they're ""in bloom"", but it also has a dark side with all the worries, regrets, and the inveitability of its end. The shattered mirror is the symbol of those shifting perspectives, of one concept substituting the other. What do you think?",7,10

I make bleach shirts, and I decided to experiment some with what I could do, so decided to do a whole set of Hip-Hop Monsters (plus a couple extras).  These are made using self-made stencils out of freezer paper, cut out with an exacto knife, and bleached directly onto the shirt.  My main goal was to get experience with multiple levels of bleaching, and the balloons from the HHM images were perfect.  Each one took me around three hours of work.  The J-Hope one is my first attempt at three different bleach levels, and I think it went well!  There was some bleeding on Rapmon's, so I'll redo that one eventually, but I was very excited to finally finish the last one tonight, and was itching for people to share it with that might appreciate them!",6,20

Generally BTS comments are downvoted unless they are related to a critique in some way (like how someone doesn't like their stage names or some drama surrounding rapmon or something). I also see how people seems to only address them as Bulletproof Boy Scouts, which I'm not sure what the deal is behind that name but I see it being used sarcastically or in a condescending way.

There is even troll accounts dedicated to hating on BTS but I never see it for other groups. The only groups that come close to getting regular hate are iKon and EXO. (no clue why they are disliked either, but I don't keep up to date on them) Anyway, I hope this isn't a controversial topic I'm just very curious!
