Keeping up with the tradition of dropping hints from MAMA performance for their next album, what do you think the next song / album title / concept will be? 

I was thinking it could be something to do with the fight between good and evil. In WINGS, the boys met temptations, and probably for the next one it will show their struggle against it (or maybe accepting it?). This is what I thought because:


* JK suspended in the air with feather and thunders and such. Seems to signify that he's falling (or being set free, depending on how you look at it) to temptations.
* Jimin and J-hope sync/mirror performance. Jimin has blue BG while J-hope has red. Something about duality of good and evil?
*  V showed his bare back ^lordhelpme ^still ^shook with scars, covering Jin's eyes and lookin like he bout to devour us all
* Some sort of ""cleansing ritual"" dance after BST and before FIRE. ^As ^if ^they're ^attempting ^to ^cleanse ^dirty ^thoughts ^from ^ARMY's ^head 

Ok right now still too shook to decipher all the hints and come up with theories but I'm sure you guys also have some theories about this!

Or maybe we wont get a repackage at all and there's a Wings Part 'S' mini album coming up? early next year

what do you guys think, will the next comeback be a mini album, a repackage or something else?

when do you think the next comeback will be?

what kind of concept do you think it will be, do you think they're going to continue with the dark concept of wings or perhaps something entirely different?

And what genre do you expect the song to be?

something like Save Me and BST

or something like Danger or their earlier stuff?

or perhaps something completely new and experimental?

BTS is talented  I think they deserved to win the award. You guys are trying to exaggerate and that is how you ruin your own artist's image.

I dont really know how to put this without sounding dumb or something. BTS is my UB group, I follow them since their debut and Im very glad theyve become so popular. 
I appreciate all the members equally for what they bring to the group, musically or not.
 
But recently I found myself really disliking a member and I feel really bad about it. Its not just being annoyed by his personality or anything, I just strongly dislike him for no reason. If he left the group I wouldn't mind at all (although it would be very harmful to BTS overall and I hope it never happens). Ive never felt like that about any idol ever, and I feel really guilty, like Im an OT6 akgae or something. 

I think I just hate the fact that hes very popular even if I dont really get why, and so I get really competitive about my bias being more popular than him. I get annoyed every time he has screen time, or when too many people have him as their biais, or when he has ""too many  lines in a song, and Im low key glad when other members receive more love (god it sounds even pettier written down). I mean I dont care that much about all of this, I wish him well, but still. 

I dont know if Im the only one who's felt like that to some extent ? Like has anyone ever felt jealous of another member or something ? 
I have no idea why Im writing this here, I wanted to get this off my chest and maybe read answers that would help me stop being so petty, I feel sooo bad about this, I really want to like them all...

**TL;DR : I just figured out I hate a member and I dont know what to do with this information**

BTS Jimin danced together with J Hope with a blindfold at MAMA which was like an extension to their music video  

After the performance, Instiz members responded ""eyy... he could have seen what's in front of him because it's a lace right? I mean if not, how could he dance? he had so many turns too."" at the ""living room"" board. (t/n: this is where users talk about all idols anonymously)

translation of the fanaccount of J Hope and Jimin posted on Chinese Got7 fancafe during BTS's stage  

*- Hello. I'm a fan of Got7 who attended this year's MAMA. I came here to compliment another group because I've seen many other fans praising other artists. I was in front of Jimin during BTS's intro stage. Jungkook appeared from the center? stage so I was just looking front because I couldn't really see him but suddenly two people appeared in front of me. One had a blindfold and the other member held his hand tightly and took him to his position and said something while holding his face firmly and he also ran to his own side of the stage. I realized later that these people were Jimin and J Hope. I knew it then that this team really gives trust and trusts one another.*  

As you can tell from the fanaccount, Jimin couldn't see what's in front of him so he was helped by another member

and you can also see from the HQ photos that this blindfold is not a see through material and you can tell that he's closing his eyes  

in other words, it means that he was dancing only with his senses. you can understand how much effort he puts into his work.  
He didn't just wear a blindfold to fool the audience. I was surprised by the fact that he danced with a real pro like mind.

Now that we've successfully got through the MAMA's. Its time to focus on the 26th Seoul Music Awards (SMA).
The award show takes place on the 19th January 2017. You can watch a live broadcast at 7PM KST on KBS WORLD (YOUTUBE).
ATTENTION There is ONLY ONE DAESANG, which is Artist of the Year. BTS has been nominated for this alongside 9 other artists. The criteria for Daesang at SMA is...
- 20% mobile votes.
- 10% Sports Seouls popularity poll.
- 40% digital downloads and album sales.
- 30% percent judges scores.
Currently we are around 2% behind EXO on the mobile voting. So please download the SMA app on your mobile and start voting. The app is most likely in Korean but you should be able to find instructions on how to vote in places like Twitter, Amino or just a simple Google search should do it.


Lets also not forget about the 31st Golden Disk Awards (GDA). There hasn't been much info released about this yet so all I can say is...
It takes place sometime in January 2017. Last years took place on the 20th - 21st so expect dates around then.
There are TWO Daesangs. Disk Daesang (album releasing) &amp; Digital Daesang (digital single releasing). BTS has been nominated for only ONE Daesang which is the Disk Daesang. I'm not sure of the criteria yet so I can only advise you upto here.

Remember to keep yourself informed ARMY. And keep FIGHTING!

Mostly, I'm sure that the solos would probably not be part of their concerts because that would mean each member would have to do one - but if you had to choose, would you pick between them dancing to the beat or singing it? I doubt that they would be able to do both - especially Jimin or Taehyung, considering that Lie and Stigma are both pretty difficult songs vocally. I can see J-hope attempting to do both with MAMA because he has insane stamina, but that's about it. I doubt a ballad like Awake has a dance set to it anyway, so probably singing?

What do you all think? This is probably a good time to pop the question of who you'd like to see do a solo album first at some point too. (Also, mods, I'm unsure if I'm allowed to post this so just let me know if I need to remove it \o/)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Much as I love the sub, it doesn't quite satisfy the craving I have for smaller, more involved conversations with other fans, and there are several other users who have expressed the same feeling. As someone who is a member of a very active LINE gc, I can attest that groupchats are a great place to get your fangirl/boying fix and make new friends in the process. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is a thread where those in existing Bangtan groupchats or those who are looking to make new ones can post their respective links or advertise their groupchat/interest! Unfortunately, while the groupchat I'm in is closed, I have some links to other ""groupchats"" you can consider joining. They are discord servers that aren't as small as groupchats (in that they often range from 50-500 or more members), but they're not a bad place to start:

- For those who like gaming or just want to talk casually with TONS of other fans, try the general bangtan discord:  https://discord.gg/h3unb8g

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's super organized and comprehensive; it even has a channel that automatically updates when new content from prominent fansubbers or the official ibighit channel appears on YouTube. I think a lot of people would like this cord.

- For those who aren't as interested in gaming but would still love to discuss with other fans, there's also this cord that /u/playlisthoarder initially made for MAMA 2016 livestreaming which has now evolved to a general gc for ARMYs/subredditors: https://discord.gg/kVwZ97f

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I wasn't there for the livestreaming, but I hear that a lot of people enjoyed chatting together on here. Check it out!!

- If you want something that combines both cords (i.e. you enjoy gaming, but would prefer something more exclusive to the subreddit), there's the unofficial /r/bangtan gaming discord made by me, lol: https://discord.gg/TA8aDNb

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Try out the cords and comment below with your groupchat/interest, and to my fellow fans, I hope you find a platform and groupchat you enjoy. :-)

Copy/paste:  

I noticed this after watching BTS. They don't try to make only one member popular. It looks like they support every member of the group. Their company doesn't focus on ""what should we do to make him famous?"" but it seems like they focus more on ""what should they do as a team to become famous?"". I thought they were just supporting Jungkook during ""FIRE"" because he was the center member but this time J Hope's the center member. Also, they support Jimin and members who are talented singers, dancers, and rappers too. I think their company does a great job at supporting every member. I thought people weren't really getting the chance to learn about J Hope's talent because he used to be famous before their debut too but they put him as the center member this time so I think they're doing a good job. Ah and BTS's performance at MAMA was just amazing.... I heard that they had 100 back dancers (shivers) I think their company really supports them well.

Response +406 -30  


1. The company teaches their trainees the reason why trainee teams fail to debut, reasons why a team fails  and tells them their team comes before them. The members don't want to affect the team in bad ways so they do their best. Jimin works harder because he was the last member to join the group. +128 -2  

2. It's so true that they don't ignore the members' talents. It's amazing how they allow the members to release mixtape when it doesn't really help the company financially +123 -0  

3. They really educate their trainees well. They're the type of company that tells their trainees ""it doesn't matter if your score bad at monthly tests but you should leave the company right now if you have no passion for music."" +105 -0  

4. Bighit is amazing because they're not even a small company, they're more like a crew. They're a really small company but they still raised BTS. I think if BTS contributed 99% of effort, Bighit continuously supported them with 1% of faith. It's hard for the artists to release albums continuously but I think that was a very important factor behind BTS's success +46 -0  

5. Was it Bang Sihyuk? When someone asked him when Suga's going to release his mixtape, he replied, ""Suga will release one when he wants to."" I like the company because they have that carefree? vibe of letting their artists do what they are good at +44 -0  

6. That's also true but the members also do their best in their position so every member catches your eyes +40 -0  

7. They really support the boys musically. Especially mixtapes. They don't care who they bring as featuring artist or even if they swear. +36 -0  

8. I think they're good at communicating +32 -0  

9. I think their company staffs know how to help the whole group to last long and do well! Honestly, one of the biggest reason why a group breaks apart is because they only support one member but BTS's company supports every member in the field he's best at and I think this will help them to gain more public recognition. This is usually what fans know so I'm curious how their staffs know this... perhaps they were hardcore fangirls/boys when they were younger..  +23 -0  

10. Their HYYY concept was just amazing. I'm not a debut fan but my heart feels heavy when I see how much BTS has grown up and   I think ""HYYH"" is the perfect phrase that describes present BTS +18 -0

I've been lurking on this sub for a while and am finally pushing down my shyness to introduce myself. I'm a 25 year old noona fan and have have been listening to KPop for over ten years now. I used to be very active online before I became a hermit. But now I'm stepping out of my cave because everyone seems so nice here!

I became an army in June of last year, and I think I will now be an army forever. Bangtan never fails to brighten my day and puts a smile on my face even during the most trying of times. My bias is Jimin, but I really do love all of the members and want to buy them all the meat and yummy foods they want if the fates will ever allow!

Also, I wanted to ask all who will be attending the concert in Newark (after the bloodbath that will be Wednesday)--

Is there anyone as crazy as me that wants to wait early, EARLY morning in Newark so they can be near the front of the pit/stage? The area around the Prudential Center is really shady when it's dark...so without the help of my big, intimidating guy friends (who have bailed on me for this trip from TN), I was hoping to learn self-defense in three months (haha) and also gather a group of fans who would want to help each other out and keep places in line during bathroom break and also do breakfast/lunch runs, and most importantly, keep each other safe. And if people are comfortable with it, we could share the cost of a hotel room, too (Hotel Indigo is right next to the venue). We could also use my government employee discount! It's not a huge amount less, but every penny counts!

I am extremely short and have never had a real good experience in the pit. I would shoot for a seated ticket for the ease and comfort, but I would really, really love to see them up close so that I can finally believe that the experience I'm having is real. I'm just basing this off of a B1A4 concert I went to in the past, but I feel that maybe the VIP tickets will only be for standing tickets? For anyone who went to a TRB concert, what was the ticketing like?

I really hope to make friends here! I don't have any friends who are fellow fans to gush about Bangtan to.",58,22

A few days ago, we announced the 2016 census and 'boy meets /r/bangtan' project [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5e7hp5/bts_projects_announcement_census_2016_and_boy/). Please note that responses from the census will be used for this project, and that the census is completely anonymous. The census is now open and will remain open from **0.00am 1 Dec  11.59pm 12 Dec 2016** (our apologies for the slight delay in the posting of this thread).    
 
Please use the discussion thread to expand on answers given in the census! In the census book, we would also like to include some longer responses and comments elaborating on the questions and responses received in the census, so as to provide reasons and commentary as to why we like certain things. Since the census form itself is not really suited for this kind of submission, and to also credit people without violating the anonymity of the census, we will be running a separate thread for comments that may be included in the book 

Please only answer the census ONCE per person. Note that because we are starting the data collating process whilst the census is ongoing, it will not be possible to edit census responses after you submit the form.  
 
For reference, the list of questions is [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gQQrVHGpcpQ84WfR). Please note that we have altered the questions slightly from what was published previously. We have made a small change after the announcement post about the question regarding favourite performances of BTS and the members. After feedback, these questions will now be asked in the discussion thread exclusively, and will not be asked as census questions. This is for logistical purposes. Our apologies for any confusion or inconvenience! In short, the questions that will be asked are:  
 
Multiple choice or checklist style questions: (compulsory for responders)  
 
* demographic questions  
* questions relating to discovery and consumption of BTS / kpop  
* questions relating to use of /r/bangtan   
* questions regarding bias and favourite song/album/mv/choreo.   
 
Short answer questions: (non-compulsory for responders)   
 
* favourite BTS memory   
* favourite things about BTS and each member   
 
Please see the discussion thread for the questions asked there.  
 
Please let us know ASAP if you notice any issues with the survey. Feel free to ask questions, give feedback etc in the comments below. If you have any issues or questions to do with the discussion thread, please ask them here in this post. We want to leave the discussion post free for comments answering the questions only.  
 
Results will be posted as soon as possible.  
 
A big thank you to everyone who volunteered for artwork/illustration, translating, and for other help for the project so far! If you still want to submit an artwork, help with translation to Korean or help in any other way, it's not too late! Send us a PM.  
 
Please note that for illustrations, we've had enough volunteers to do two full rounds of illustrations for members. We may open up a third round if there is sufficient interest. We are also opening up opportunities to illustrate other questions of the census book (what topics we cover in the end is dependent on the interest of artists, but topics could include [but are not limited to] favourite song/MV/choreo etc., OT7 artwork and some of the demographic questions, depending on what you are interested in drawing) if you are interested in other illustration opportunities.

Nothing is listed, not even our band names, heck, even EXO isn't on that list, which means it's probably pre-2012.

Same goes for TVTropes, which is in slightly better shape - I edited it a bit a few months back, but it hasn't been touched since BST era. I'd have posted this on OH if it was up, because I know lots of people follow the general Bangtan thread, but does anyone have suggestions to spruce the places up? There's so much fanlore for BTS - archiveofourown has hit over 20k fics at this point, and their social media presence is probably the highest it has ever been for a K-pop group. I think they deserve a little bit of hype? Even if you're not a particular supporter of RPF and the like, it would be super cool to have an archive where you could keep both receipts - of fanwars, how much they've achieved, and what controversies they've faced over the years. 

So basically, I'm sort of suggesting some of us team up to revive the Fanlore and TVTropes section - even if it's old and dusty, it always helps to have an extra archive just in case. Especially now that there's a Bangtan-only forum (I'm probably going to crosspost this there at some point), it would be interesting to document our fandom experiences as it happens! Or - of course, this would take way more work and funds, lol, create an actual website for the content. I'd say subreddit, but reddit gets reports of most of the drama so we do have a sort of disorganized archive anyway that we just need to put together. (Plus, our good mods do have a compilation post of sorts which we can just link back to.)

Tl;dr I know this sounds sort of like a thankless job, but I'm leaving this just to see if anyone is interested! I mean, it's at least worth a discussion or two. I know plenty of people take years to catch up with fandom drama, inside jokes or tropes either way, but...yeah. Resources are always good.",9,17

So what's your prediction on it - do you expect them to make a bangtan bomb/vlive/video/SOMETHING of them reading them or at least reacting to each others letters? what do you wish they'll do? what do you think they have written and how do you think theyll react to it?

few weeks ago i posted about ordering these BTS puma bogsock shoes from [Hallyumart.com](https://www.hallyumart.com/) because they were surprisingly helpful to me.

[originalpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5dw7q5/hallyumartcom_was_surprisingly_helpful_bts_puma/)

They were the only re-sellers online that had free/affordable shipping and wasn't upscaling the price.

Some people requested i post some pics after i received the product!  here it is!  http://imgur.com/gallery/AGqiL
The wait time wasn't actually too long, about 21 days with free shipping. As far as i know, it is not counterfeit ( i checked on other forums and it looks like the tagging and branding is official ).
They sent me a tracking number after i asked and it was pretty straight forward from there. The sizing is perfect, and package came undamaged. They also sent me a free pack of BTS post cards and free puma socks .

i am a little bit of a sneaker head and have been eyeing these since they announced the release. As for the shoe itself, i'm pretty happy with the quality of the shoe. Comfy in the back, but the front &amp; sole is quite stiff and will probably need some time to loosen up &amp; break in. The material is really thick and it does get quite warm , but other than that it's a great casual styled sneaker. 

 i hope this helps someone! :) ",21,40

Reminding you all that this is a game to determine which song we like best from each album. All you have to do is
#vote for the song you like the least.
Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

**Reminder:** in the beginning of this game it was decided by majority vote that alternative versions of the same songs won't be included, so this is your only chance to vote for *I Need U* and *Outro: Love Is Not Over* - the INU remixes and the outro's full length edition aren't going to be included in Young Forever's rounds. The same will happen to *Run*, *Butterfly* and *Outro: House of Cards* in * pt.2*'s Survivor.

And as always, **please make sure you have heard all songs before voting.**

There is a button on the subreddit sidebar right above Main that also contains the link that will open an invite to the server.


[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a free voice and text chat where its easy to share links, images, gifs, etc. Its available for use on your browser, for [download](https://discordapp.com/download) on Windows/Mac, or mobile ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord&amp;hl=en), [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-gamers/id985746746?mt=8)).

Fourth, 
It was so satisfying seeing these numbers grow every month. I was hoping that they would reach 200 millions by the end of 2016. I thought that it would be so cool if they managed to double their streams in just 7 months but they managed to triple it. I'm honestly so proud of them and how far have they come this year.",4,46

This year has been incredible, not just for Bangtan, but for all of Kpop in general. I would love to know what made a huge impact on you! 

I want to list 10 of my favorite songs of the year, 5 of my favorite MVs, 5 of my favorite albums, and 5 of my favorite choreographies. Feel free to do the same or only part of those. I didn't want to make separate posts for all of these because I thought that might seriously annoy the sub, ha. 

-------
Without further ado, here goes:

**My Top 10 Favorite Songs**: 

10) [Red Velvet- Russian Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslJYDX3o8s): I'm super in love with RV (more like super in love with Joy, tbqh), and this song was just excellent and really freaking catchy.

9) [Day6- Letting Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-1TGNmQqZA): My go-to karaoke song, forreal. I adore everything about this song!

8) [Zico- I am you, you are me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewjucLierFc): When this song first came out I was totally obsessed. I was so surprised by how much I liked hearing Zico sing, and his rapping on the track is mellow but still has weight, which I appreciate.

7) [SHINee- 1of1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJua7KEP_oE): SHINee totally killed it with this 90s throwback. Everything about this track is pure gold, and I don't think a lot of groups could've pulled this off.

6) [TWICE- TT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePpPVE-GGJw): Ugghhhhh, I looooovvveeeee TWICE. I'm utter and complete trash for them, they've totally suckered me in, it's ridiculous. This song is like, the cutest thing ever. 

5) [EXO- Cloud 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuzgEBSnmjU): This song is ***so*** good! I could (and do) listen to it endlessly. It's so soothing and the beat is fantastic. 

4) [Mamamoo- Woo Hoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eCJOj4NLlg): My girls, my loves. My fave group after Bangtan. That this song was essentially a CF says everything. It reminds me of 90s Mariah Carey at her peak. It's utter pop perfection.

3) [Dean- what2do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH3GZkxoZeU): When you pair Dean with Crush you can't go wrong (RIP Crush and Zion.T). This song is...just amazing. When it came out early this year it was snowing in Philly and I listened to it every single day, and I haven't stopped. It's really lovely.

2) [Seventeen- Pretty U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=046_3Bu3iAA): Seventeen impresses me so much- I really adore them. This song is like, so earnestly cheesy and upbeat and lovely- I love every second of it and can never get enough.

1) [BTS- Save ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso): Hands down my favorite song of the year. Just the beginning alone kinda makes me tear up a little (okay, it definitely makes me tear up a little). It's so simple, but I honestly think Save ME is one of their best songs ever. Perfect. A perfect song.

Honorable Mentions (I just couldn't fail to acknowledge them): BTS- Lost, [Mamamoo- You're the Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhmTM1cRro), [Dean- D (Half Moon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKiauCIJhv0), [VIXX- Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bnIb1JJHdA), BTS- Begin, BTS- Cypher Pt 4

-------
**My Top 5 Favorite Music Videos**

5) [Wonder Girls- Why So Lonely?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGODWJgR-c): WG look amazing, and I love the style, and the vengeful acts done on a mannequin were pretty funny. Also, Yubin and Sunmi. That is all.

4) [Luna- Free Somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwG8f9nt4s): Luna's work this year was so underrated. She killed it, and this MV is super creative and quite the spectacle. It looks fantastic, and her DHL shirt is soooo awesome, I wish it weren't hundreds of dollars :(

3) [BTS- Save ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso): The simplicity of this video is what makes it so brilliant. The decision to mute and darken the colors was so smart, giving it this gorgeous melancholic feeling. I will never, ever, ever get tired of watching this. 

2) [Akdong Musician- How People Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc2yBheAbo): Amazing colors, amazing outfits, awesome concept. This MV never gets old, it's a true feast for the eyes. Also Chanhyuk and Suhyun are the cutest people on the planet. Aside from Jimin.

1) [BTS- Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc): Don't even need to elaborate. Genius. As much as I really like BlackPink, the boys really deserved winning the MAMA in this category, imo. 

Honorable Mentions: [Lee Hi- Hold My Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuUEnho33so), [Taemin- Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQQJ7zBzYJs), [Winner- Sentimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV9NJGTLm-4)

-------
**My Top 5 Favorite Choreographies**

5) [Astro- Hide &amp; Seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b177-ni319g): Omg, these boys are the cutest things! Also, this choreo looks *exhausting*- they're jumping around so much, but they make it look pretty effortless. Combined with how ridiculously 'feel-good' the song is, it is kind of a no-brainer for me!

4) [B.A.P- Feel So Good](https://youtu.be/CMo2W5dqNcQ?t=47s): One of my favorite songs by a group I love this year. It has such a great beat, and the choreo makes great use of it. I love how funky it is, and the movements in the chorus always make me want to dance with them.

3) [Seventeen- Very Nice](https://youtu.be/A1gJQpMSkEU?t=48s): Omggg this choreo! Perfection. Seventeen always bowls me over with their dancing. I can't believe they invented wearing suspenders. Unreal, how coordinated they are...there is no weak link in this group when it comes to choreography! 

2) [BTS- 21st Century Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGyCUnrIS74): I can't even explain how much I love this choreography. It's just the cutest. They just look so good. Everything's amazing. Bless. 

1) [NCT U- 7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTmR-ogUXqo): In my opinion, not only was this the most technically challenging choreography of the year, but NCT U was my favorite debut of the year. They ***killed it***. This choreo honestly seems like some of the most difficult I've ever seen in Kpop, if for no other reason than the simple fact that nothing repeats itself. But they make it look so easy. Ugh. Unbelievable. 

Honorable Mentions: [TWICE- TT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uypQGzzhns)- because I spent 2 days learning it so I could pretend to be Momo, [Lay- what U need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCMdn61JMd4)- because I can't get enough of Lay slapping his own butt, and [NCT Dream- Chewing Gum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB_sC__Y6Gc)- because honestly, which genius thought up making middle-schoolers dance with hoverboards?! So awesome. Haha, I have no idea how old they are, but I heard they were hella young :D

-------
**My Top 5 Favorite Albums**


5) **Agust D- Agust D**: Totally raw, completely unique, and we don't deserve this genius. We're so lucky to have Yoongi, you guys. Like forreal.

4) **SHINee- 1 of 1**: Pure 90s brilliance. So unexpected, but executed perfectly. I enjoyed every single song on this album. 

3) **EXO- EX'ACT**: EXO is definitely a force to be reckoned with. I really loved every track on this album, and think it was a super strong body of work from this group this year. All of the singles were fantastic, but the other tracks on the album, like Cloud 9, Heaven, and Stronger totally solidify this album for me.

2) **BTS- WINGS**: I'm so, so, ***so*** satisfied with this album. We are so lucky to be in this fandom and to be blessed with such amazing music. The boys poured everything into this work, and it showed. From beginning to end we got to see how multifaceted BTS is without the music ever losing its identity. And that takes serious skill and talent.

1) **Dean- 130 Mood : TRBL**: The only reason WINGS isn't my #1, lol. This album is sheer perfection. Every single second is perfection. It is ***SO*** good. It boggles my mind. Dean is so talented and he's just going to keep blowing up, I'm convinced. 


Okay, that is finally it! I live for reading these kinds of lists from you all, please indulge me! Happy holidays, everyone! &lt;3

I'm in Dubai at the moment, and I've been planning our tourist activities around what they did in the 2016 Summer Package (I just came back from the desert tour). Funny moment; my mum said to pray so that the car won't tip over, but I thought ""Min Yoongi told me it won't tip over so it won't tip over.""

So I just wanted to know if others have been having this same kind of excitement. Bighit is really doing it right, releasing summer packages and NOW photobooks based in other countries, helping their international fans feel more of a connection.

I hope this is alright to post, please delete if irrelevant.

As the title says, looking for volunteers to create live show compilation posts for BTS' upcoming events! The end of the year is approaching which means lots of special music shows and awards. To help keep the sub organized and our fellow ARMYs updated, I'm hoping we can continue with these compilations. An example post: [2016 MAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5fydnv/161202_2016_mnet_asian_music_awards_mama_6pm_red/). 

With the help of the subreddit mods, there is a [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/liveperformances) that outlines a guide for volunteers. I've tweaked my previous post formulas and included things that I think are essential. If you have any suggestions, let me know!

Below is a signup for upcoming events that will be broadcast. Volunteers will create posts a few hours before broadcast and update links/information as it is available. If you have questions or would like to help, please comment or send me a message!

Thanks all and happy holidays~

489,2016-12-21,2016,12,21,14,5ji5ei,[BTS Projects] Closing post for the 'Rice Wreaths for V' project,BTSprojects,1482297647,"Raise your hands, who else ^(besides u/dorkprincess) did a backflip when they saw Dreame Korea tweet a picture of our wreath?

I didn't ~~cause my grandma hips would break~~, but I had a heart attack...so close. Guys, I was so excited Tae was able to see out little community encouraging him. But you know what I'm more exited about? Sharing all the details with you!! So if you're impatient like me, you can skip to the bottom of this post to see the wreath at the event.

----------

Before buying the arrangement, we (the coordinators) decided that we wanted more of the money to go towards buying rice than buying a fancy arrangement. Judging from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5820a4/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_doing_more/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) a while back the sub seemed more inclined towards charity and just generally doing good to the community, so we thought we made a good call and later on I'll explain why.

&amp;nbsp;

We had originally set a goal of raising $200 USD so we could cover the price of the wreath (~ $100 USD) and buy at least four 10 kg^(22 lbs) rice bags (~ $25 USD each). It seemed expensive, and at a certain time impossible, since holidays were approaching and we realized that would mean some of you guys would have other expenses too. After a lot of discussion, the coordinators decided we would try covering the first $100 USD for the wreath arrangement so that whatever money came in after that (donated by the sub) would be used to pay for the rice.

&amp;nbsp;

Once again, you guys amazed us. We reached our goal AND surpassed it! In the end, we were able to raise about $320 USD with your help. How does that translate to the wreath? Okay, well:

* we went with this modest [arrangement](http://i.imgur.com/2bNsKiX.png) that already came with 20 kg^(44 lbs) of rice
* and bought 80 kg^(176 lbs) of rice

Yup. 100 kg^(220 lbs) of rice in total!!

Not too bad for our little community, huh?

&amp;nbsp;

So, what happens to the rice now? Well the rice doesn't actually go to Tae, but to families/people in need. This is the reason why we decided to have more of the money go towards buying rice. After he receives the rice, Tae chooses 'poor neighbours' to whom he would like the rice to be given to and then DREAME donates the rice in Tae's name to them. [*source*](https://dreame.co.kr:127/en/).

That's pretty neat, I think. We managed to congratulate and encourage Tae while also helping families that need food. Good job guys!!

&amp;nbsp;

I really don't have words to express how special it felt to work with you guys to do something for Tae. Thanks fall short, so I guess *strong power thank you* is all I can say.

So, peace out guys and I'll leave you with the pics DK sent us:

* [Front view](http://i.imgur.com/g8r8SNO.jpg)

* [From the sides](http://i.imgur.com/AjHj5pk.jpg) with a shout out to ma boi Minho looking dapper af in the background. Oh!! [Bonus video](https://www.periscope.tv/w/1yNGadzwpLEKj#) where our wreath wasn't shown ;n; The girls are most likely standing right next to our wreath judging by that Minho wreath in the back (look left when the video starts). But hey, look at all those wreaths!!

* [Message for Tae](http://i.imgur.com/SVRg1cM.jpg). It was just a short, sweet message:
&gt;
&gt; Dear V,
&gt;
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; Congratulations on your acting debut! You've said numerous times that acting has been your dream, and we are so proud of you for achieving this milestone in your career. We are excited to see you bring the character of Hansung to life and also hear you sing in the drama's soundtrack with your Jin-hyung. 
&gt;
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; No matter the outcome, please continue living your dream as Actor Kim Taehyung and also as our beloved V, our special TaeTae of BTS. We will always be here cheering you on! 
&gt;
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; With love always,
&gt; 
&gt;Your international fans at r/bangtan
&gt; 
&gt; [names of contributing fans]
&gt;

* [And then, DK sent us this message](http://i.imgur.com/3fkYLg4.jpg). It reads "" *20 kg of rice can feed 300 children* "" first in Korean, then English, then Chinese, then Japanese. 
&amp;nbsp;

Did you really think we would let you go that easily without promoting ourselves? Ha! Nah, don't worry, we're not really promoting our selves. We just want to let you guys know that BTS Projects has a [localendar](https://www.localendar.com/elsie?JSP=PublishedCalendar&amp;mode=PUBLISH_PUBLIC&amp;search_type=M0&amp;start_date=12/01/16&amp;calendar_id=561481) on the sidebar of the sub and a [twitter](https://twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) too. These are just to help with reminders and to give you guys an idea of the time between each project.

One last thing (well, three technically): please look out for our early 2017 posts. We'll have a few different posts: **1)** One post for the census results and another post for the closing the of the census book project **2)** Another one for J-Hope's cakeday **3)** Followed by Yoongi's birthday one.

I've been thinking about making a PDF with annotated and translated lyrics for the Agust D mixtape. The translation would include both literal and implied meanings for each line, and the annotations would explain double entendres, cultural references, slang etc. to the best of my ability. 

I was just wondering what you guys as fans might want to see from the annotations, anything you might have been curious about lyrics-wise for the mixtape in the past, or anything you might want to have added or think might be helpful to have. Thanks :) ",32,99

(If I do, Ill come back and edit this post at the time I was supposed to in order to make it more accurate for next year \^^ ). I also want to do it before holiday festivities keep me busy, which is why Im doing it early.~~  

I worried for nothing lol, It's been updated! Without further ado, heres BTS 2016 time capsule, enclosed ~~December 22, 2016 at 1PM EST~~ December 28, 2016 at 12PM EST to be opened sometime between December 21, 2017, and December 31, 2017 (Ideally Dec 28 again ;)).

**A PREFACE**

Imagine this: You're sitting in bed. University has been over for a week. You've already watched 3 seasons of Gilmore Girls, finished your copy of Pokemon Y you borrowed from a friend a year ago, and half heartedly got 2/3 of the way through Fire Emblem Awakening before giving up. You are, officially, out of things to do. You've spent the last year being productive, achieving goals, reaching new levels, and now... you have to relax? Do nothing? It's just not realistic.

Then. From the corner of your mind (the corner that you try to ignore, the one that usually has really awful ideas) you hear a whisper.

*Google docs is pretty nice*

""It is pretty nice."" You reply. You're not sure where the voice in your head is going with this.

*Did you see the Mamamoo trans index?* Its voice is insidious. It knows your weaknesses.

""I did see it."" You reply. You didn't just see it, you *admired* it. It's sorted by date, it's colour coded, there are separate columns for YouTube and Google Drive. Each era has it's own page. You've been working your way through the content bit by bit. You *envy* it.

*Wouldn't it be nice if Bangtan had something like that?*

You pause. It *would* be nice. Remember that time you tried to find one specific Danger Era M!Countdown JPN Backstage clip of Hoseok arguing with someone? You couldn't find it. You went around DailyMotion in circles, opening the same clips over and over again. Imagine if you had a spreadsheet where you could go straight to Danger era, see all the Music Show clips colour coded and arranged by date...

*You could do it.* 

It's winning you over. Your resolve is crumbling. 'I *could* do it,' You think. But better. Optimise it for other languages too, colour code it *properly*. Pre-debut content, too. Important performances. You could make it easier for subbers to find un-subbed videos. You open up a FB chat with your best friend. 

**YOU: 11:48** you'll think i'm crazy when i tell you what i'm working on these holidays.

**HER: 11:49** hahaha what is it? every bangtan video ever? lol

**HER: 11:52** oh my god it is, isnt it. you're insane.

You open up Google Docs. It's time to begin.

--------

NOW that that's over and done with. (I felt like I deserved it, this was a *COLOSSAL* effort.) I present to you, the BTS CONTENT INDEX. **[IT'S RIGHT HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVG4gUFvl4Gt-DlEmm1IQLIga3zV1Xb55WMf0gygqF0/edit?usp=sharing)**. Essentially, I'm a control freak who likes data entry. Masterposts are great and useful, but we know some of the best bangtan moments are from 18 second backstage videos, or that obscure japanese interview they did after debuting that you feel like you watched once, in a dream, on a skeezy website with popups. I trawled the internet and found these videos - almost all of them. (No twitter videos, most things under 1 or 2 minutes weren't included depending on the content, etc)

What do I want from you?

1. Help me make it better! Would you like me to put a star next to really good interviews? Would you like me to make an extra page for 'essential' things to watch? Have I missed anything crucial?

2. **PLEASE** share it on social media! Along with the message that I'm asking foreign subbers to add their content - I want this to help more than just English speakers. I'll attempt to contact some of these myself, as well. 

3. If you yourself have subbed videos (not english) in the past, DM me on twitter (@BTSContentIndex) or reddit, and I'll send you a link where you can input your videos to the spreadsheet!

3. Mods, please display this prominently on the sub. I'll be getting in contact with bangtan.tumblr.com, as well as BTS trans and other prominent fan sites, but ultimately I want this document to get a lot of exposure, and make it easier for everyone to quickly find subbed BTS content.

**[EDIT: [HERE](https://twitter.com/BTSContentIndex/status/817951955335061505)'s a tweet you can RT with the link!**

**[EDIT #2:** All your thank you messages are really sweet and heart-warming!! I really enjoyed making this and I'm glad I can finally contribute something of meaning to the fanbase!! If this is your christmas present, my christmas present is my cold heart being melted by all these cute comments ;_; Have a wonderful festive season!",72,258

For me, it was Jin, J-Hope, and Suga! I remember seeing BTS' group photo (I think it was Boy in Luv promo era) and Jin caught my attention like ""whoa so handsome!"". He was my first introduction to BTS, but I didn't enlist at that point. 

Few weeks later I was watching Sistar's Touch My Body MV and the comment section keep mentioning J-Hope as the 5th member of Sistar, so I got curious and did some digging and found out he's from BTS. I was like ""OMG isn't he from the same group as that handsome guy??"" I was a casual fan of BTS at this point. Still follows them, but not as intensive as now lol

And then, the member that finally made me enlist is Suga. He dropped his mixtape AGUST D and I was shook and.. basicallu just shook to the core I keep listening to his mixtape for like a week. And then I went down the rabbit hole...  I started watching Bangtan Bombs, all their Vlive, the fancams, the lyric translation, the interviews, variety shows, etc. I had officially enlisted thanks to these 3.

How bout you guys?? :D",97,36

I'm not sure if any of you have run across this girl's channel, but I've been following her for awhile and she does tutorials for non-Korean speaking fans of the Cyphers and AgustD. She's multilingual and her pronunciation is very clear. I've found them very helpful with pronunciation in general, but it's also cool to be able to learn these fast songs.

Feel free to add to the list!

Some classic Kdramas:

     - Coffee Prince- Classic gender bender

     - My love from another star- Modern day celebrity falls in love with a 400 year old alien- my fav kdrama of all time

     - Boys over flowers- classic rich boy poor girl story. Not my fav but it's a classic

     - Reply 1997- 90s story about kpop fandom, family, friendship etc. Heart warming drama

     - Sungkyunkwan Scandal- Historical gender bender, setting is similar to Hwarang. Also, Song Joong Ki- enough said

     - Descendants of the Sun

     - If you want to watch a drama with a lot of idols in it, Dream High is a good one. 2pm's Taec, Wooyoung, Suzy, T-ara's Eun Jung, IU (and Kim Soo Hyun!).

665,2016-12-30,2016,12,30,11,5l0tsv,A Lyric Discussion: Do you look up lyrics for ALL of BTS songs?,infadel-x,1483063462,"This was spurred by my observation of the survival game so far. A lot of B-sides with *beautiful* lyrics such as   (Where Did You Come From),    (Would You Turn off Your Cellphone?),  (Moving On) or Whalien 52 have been voted off (or being voted off) really early in their rounds. In my opinions, these songs can stand against any other B-sides with just their lyrics alone. Admittedly, some of these songs could be very simple sound-wise, but what make these songs Bangtan is that their lyrics are very relatable, self-conscious and poignant. Isn't that one of the main attractions of Bangtan for I-fans? So colour me surprised when these songs aren't popular at all.  
  
Which raise another question. Is it perhaps because of the language barriers, these tracks aren't popular because lyrics is not read and given its due? A MAJOR selling point for me when it comes to Bangtan is the fact that their lyrics is so beautiful, and I always look up the lyrics. Additionally, my Korean is not bad, so that has enabled me to have a certain appreciation for the way Bangtan write. Understandably, I could now see that the language barrier is higher for other fans.  
  
Do you always look up lyrics for BTS? Would annotated translations and lyrics commentary entice you to read up for on BTS lyrics? A discussion with varied POVs would be really great!

- For some reason, I think sassy/wild Seokjin would make a great Cheon Song Yi from My love from another star. Either Taetae or Yoongi could play Do Min Joon. Hobi could continue his motherly role as Cheon Song Yi's mom.

I know mine is a little weird, but I'm obsessed with their 2014 cover of This Love by Shinhwa for MBC(?). I don't know why, but their vocals were nice, the costumes, makeup, and hair were all adorable, and I loved seeing Bangtan vogue! It's really too bad they'll never make a full cover performance of it like GOT7 did. ",34,18

Can't believe it's the new year. BTS has accomplished so much in 2016, and they've only got more to show in the year to follow (after some well-deserved rest I hope). SO happy they got to be 2017's first performance!

Happy new year guys! Stay warm, safe, and hope all your wishes come true this year :)
