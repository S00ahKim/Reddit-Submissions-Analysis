I'm really impressed with this group. And the obvious care they have for their craft and opportunity. 

I just found out about the INU+Prologue+RUN+Forever Young concept MVs. How amazing! I was blown away and impressed. 

Also, I started reading the translations of their lyrics (I don't know if that's taboo as a kpop fan, but there's a language barrier so I initially don't judge it by lyrics, but the overall reaction I get from it) and I am really appreciating their contributions (I've read RapMon, Taehyung, and JK have written/produced tracks, right?) to the entire production of their tracks.

I'm obviously not a kpop expert, but are other groups like this? BTS members seem so collaborative, creative, and supportive of artistic expression.

I personally think it's Jimin. Like Yoonmin, Jihope, Jikook, Vmin, etc.. are all very popular among the fandom, especially Jikook lately. The concept of Jimin harem exists for a reason  Idek what I'm saying....

Second would be Taehyung: Taejin, TaeGi, Vhope are shipped by many as well, his big pairs are Vmin and the most popular ship of all time Vkook. 

What do you think?",11,0

Suga seems to be nice to everyone, I probably missed something but when I first got into this fandom Jimin is the last person I think of to be shipped with Yoongi lol. It's still a cute pair tho, I'm just confused. 

Many people ship Vhope as well, I don't know why, since Jhope interacts closely with everyone, especially Jimin, don't know how Vhope gotten more popular than Jihope lately. No hate tho, just asking. Is it because it's Taehyung? 

TaeGi and TaeJin don't make any sense to me either. I'm starting to think people ship them just coz there's Taehyung in the pair. Again, no hate. Just confused. Please enlighten me on that. Taejin doesn't have that much close up interaction (as far as I know of) as Namjin or dare I say, Jinmin has. Jin even chose Jimin as someone he would date if he is a girl. But I guess that time when Jimin called Jin his ""mom"" ruins the whole ship  

Whew boy here we go. Based on what I see, Vmin has far more interactions than Vkook does, but I assume most people prefer Vkook coz they are the two most popular BTS members? (And they look so good together no lie) And most casted away Vmin as simply friendship instead of a true pair. What are your thoughts on this? I personally think it's annoying when Vkook fans claimed something like ""Vmin: Friendship goal. Vkook: Relationship goal!"" in literally every Vmin videos I watched. 

Ofcoz I know ppl can ship watever they like, but I find it hard to believe they can ship it without hints. Obviously all BTS members are close to one another, but there are some ships that stand out more for a reason, and I don't see how Taejin stands out more than others. Again, no hate. TaeGi is adorable tho. But I still don't see it. Vkook is quite apparent, but Vmin is on that level of obviousness too. 

Btw, taking shipping seriously is one of my hobby, don't judge. I don't actually believe any of these ships are true, but I like to analyze them for fun whenever I'm bored so~ Please answer sincerely lol~",21,0

September: Japan promotion + weekly teaser release (four maybe)
Mid-October: Comeback and active promotion in Korea 
November: Continuing the promotion and Muster (Muster being a wrapping up of the title song and showcase of a follow-up song??) 
December: Great performances on year-ending shows (like they did last year. I heard that Perfect Man performance with Run success lead to huge influx of Korean fans. I hope this year will be the same case.)

This is kinda ideal schedule if they want  (the Grand prize) on awards shows. Suga himself wrote in a letter to members (on the Bon Voyage last ep) ""I hope to receive the Grand prize, because we all worked so hard.) So, if Big Hit cares about the grand prize, they will better look at the schedule. 

With Suga mixtape and this unprecedented teaser strategy, I guess BTS can step up to a bigger position. What do you think? Do you think BigHit making us headache will eventually get BTS more fans? Even though it is not, I really respect their effort to be genuine to themselves and have this artistry tone in all their work. I starting to appreciate BTS and BH as an artists team. ",4,22

there's been no indication from the company that this is a subunit/vocal line comeback only, so I think it'd be odd to have Namjoon, Yoongi, and Hoseok missing from the teasers entirely except in them being alluded to in the first three teasers. 

So what if teaser four has Jin as the linchpin of the whole story, and in his teaser he reunites our three tortured maknaes with their missing hyungs? And we end the series of short films with all seven of them as a group starting their adult journey because the younger ones have finally been able to connect with their adult friends. 

Part of me really wants that to happen and the other Jin Stan Part wants me to get his own superbly acted solo teaser. ",21,19

146,2016-9-10,2016,9,10,11,521525,HYYH/Wings Theory,triseke,1473475029,"So.

My friend and I have been obsessing about Wings since the first video. After multiple nights of sleuthing and scouring videos,  I think we have a theory.

We believe that each album is a new world. A new beginning as it were. Each time there is a beginning, the members get paired up in hopes of  surviving that world. The world from HYYH failed; The members could not protect each other.

Jungkook failed to stop Suga from burning up (""Better to burn out than fade away"")
Suga failed to notice Jungkook's efforts (their fight in ""Run"") and by the time he did, Jungkook had already been hit by a car.

V was possibly the most tragic. He needed Rapmon for strength to get through his awful home situation, and without him, he lost everything. (We see him trying to make the phone call in ""Stigma""). Rapmon provided normalcy and a friendship that V desperately needed.
Rapmon just didnt seem to realise how serious V's situation was, and was perhaps too carefree, and wasn't able to be there when V needed him the most (the phonecall scene in ""Reflection"").

Jimin was in the same situation as J-Hope, in that they were both struggling with mental health issues (we aren't sure, but this is what it appears to be).
This part is specualtion but we believe that Jimin helped J-Hope to forget about his problems for a little while, but not solve them. Jimin helped j-Hope throw his pills away (this was a quick fix to the problem, but didn't actually solve anything).Their situation was bleak (being in a hospital setting in ""Run""). Now Jimin doesn't have J-Hope and is subjected to his situation alone. (which we see in ""Lie"").

Currently the boys are in Purgatory (or equivalent), and each is reliving path that they ****wished**** they had taken, such as Suga returning to the scene of the car crash (Jungkook's death), Jungkook trying to fix the crying painting with no paint. 

We believe that as their new rebirth happens, new pairings will occur., and in the hopes of surviving this new world together. Jungkook's bird and envelope appear with Rapmon. Suga's melting paint appearing on Rapmon's arms lead us to believe that in this new world, Rapmon will be Jungkooks partner, to look out for him.

*FUTURE THEORY*

We believe that the next new pairing will be Suga and Jimin, and we will see J-Hope in his video allowing this to happen. Jimin (being connected to water) will be able to counteract Suga's fire, and both will be able to survive. 

An educated guess would be that V and J-Hope will be the next pairing with Rapmon's blessing in J-Hopes video. (We will update when we see the video).

Finally, we believe that Jin will remain the same. He will continue to observe, as that is what he always does. He remembers each lifetime, he remembers the mistakes, he remembers the deaths. That is why he constantly is recording and cherishing their (what he believes to be) fleeting time together. 

Of course, once all videos are out, and we have watched every single BTS video and analysed all the lyrics, we will post a big ""proof"" post. And also figure out what the hell the band Nirvana has to do with ANY of this! There are too many references to the band for it be a coincidence!

P.S. Edited the Big Bang comment out. I think it was the booze..

Would love to get feedback to this fevered post. If only you could hear the entire ramblings, but I can't type that quick lol

[Edit] Will update with our thoughts on JHopes video, and the connection to Nirvana

Personally, I've been very impressed with every single song.  I *LOVE* how they're exploring these different genres.  From the R&amp;B in Taehyung's song, the electronic/synth in RM's, and the jazz in J-Hope's.  It's really great to hear them developing their musicianship and maturing in their sound.  But it's interesting how we haven't heard anything distinctly hip-hop or rap...

I just hope these songs are actually *from* the album, and that they haven't been altered too much for the teasers.  But overall, I'm super excited for the album!!

What are your thoughts on the music? :)",33,43

However, I just really wanted to know what other people thought about it because personally, I don't. Of course, I love Jungkook to death as much as all the other members (well, except Jimin. I extol him.) but he is not a rapper in my opinion. I just feel like it's an insult for genuine rappers like Yoongi and Namjoon to call Jungkook one. Not even ""sub-rapper"" would do. Because I treat BTS as real musical artists instead of as a normal K-pop group, I want to see them as they really are. Look, here's an example: Minho from SHINEE. I don't think he's a rapper even if that's his role in his group and I quite like Minho, you know? He's a ""rapper"" in the context of being in a kpop group BUT my standards for BTS just aren't that low for me to consider Jungkook a rapper because again, in my eyes, they're not just a kpop group.

The songs! 
They are surprisingly good! actually they are beyond normal good or ok level.. 
This is not from my fan mind, but objectively, they are so fresh/trendy/edge. 
JM's killing track (and his amazing execution of the dance!!!) and J-hope vd's song (I am keep repeating it) was really beyond expectation. JK's song (for me, it is a sad traditional song sound, which allegedly was used for remembering the deceased) causes me curiosity, if that song is included, what kind of BTS style would it make? And Tae's song was also great to listen to. 
This is the first time I am waiting for their new song release since I became BTS fan. And these WING thing blew my mind and I feel blessed that I did not miss this period. 

To understand WINGS, I went back to the HYYH series, and I realized how great the songs were. After Danger, they came back with such mv as I need you/ prologue (butterfly included)/ run/ Dope... What? I cannot even imagine how old fans felt about these changes at that time. They are just so good...  If you remember, let me know how you felt and how fans reacted at that time. Thanks. ",11,41

Korea has been relatively safe from any earthquake, but today earthquake hit the southern province twice. (magnitude 5.2 and 5.9 allegedly) There is no reported casualty, but things were shaken and fallen, the seriousness of which Koreans have never experienced.  People are very surprised because we have not prepared for earthquake either mentally or systematically. We are not trained for this kind of situation, and buildings are not equipped enough to prevent from being demolished by earthquake, so it is worrying.  There is a news that there will be additional earthquakes. Korean online sites are in panic, and everyone is talking about earthquake. Meanwhile, JK posted twitter recommending music, possibly he did not feel much of the shake. (In Seoul, some felt it very strongly, while other do not.)

But can we talk about our mama Jin pls? Haha
It could be that Big Hit is just really good at training people but some people won't even get as good as Jin no matter how much you train them! This boy does not only work so hard but he has legit talent my friends. 

How did they find such a precious being?? Yes he was good looking to begin with but who knew back then when they scouted him that he'd have such a golden voice?? Sure his voice isn't out of this world but it's beautiful and really fits ballad songs and is enough to make us all cry. Those covers, his converse high(HYYH live) where he sounded like an absolute angel and now, Awake...

How lucky are they that Jin actually turned down a person from SM? XD haha Jin prolly would've had it worse in SM really. 

Jin's live singing is even better than other artists who ""can sing"". Actually, live bangtan is weeeeew. 

I'm just so happy that no one in BTS is legit tone deaf. They can all sing proper notes like have your heard Hobi's falsettos even though he's just doing it jokingly? And Suga too. Man. 

Back to Jin, this boy is just as precious as everyone else in bangtan and those people who call him talentless are talentless themselves cuz they cant seen shit. They be blind b*tches. 

His awkwardness is the most loveable thing ever. 

Plus, he's so boyfriend when he cooks D: fak

It would be especially cool to go now since it's Chuseok, a lot of people have left the city to be with family and Bangtan is 100% inside practicing. I think it would be easy to find the building and get a picture. BUT IT'S NOT! :P",17,16

Brief description:

- 80's nostalgia lookback. Old car, old house not touched (?) since the 80's, old TV/tape recorder/LP's... The specific year they throw back to is 1983. (There was an [assassination attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangoon_bombing) on the president at that time, it seems.)

- Namjoon's intro has him pressing the doorbell then hiding in the corner when the others answer the door! Cue him running back and forth until Cha Tae-hyun finally catches him in the act /lol 

- They were given magazines from that era. Talked to Mr [Bae Chul-soo](http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150313000663#jyk). [Apparently everyone thought it wasn't the real deal at first...](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/776412247753039873)

- Afterwards they had to cook dinner. Namjoon had trouble [opening the can](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/776413012143898624) using the old style can opener... Another type of can (looks like [spam/corned beef](http://ihatemymessageboard.com/2010/11/i-am-a-failure-at-meat-trapezoids/)?) [took](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/776414163509780481) [a bit](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/776417162579763201) to figure out as well.

- They played this bouncy ball game. Namjoon was [so cute](https://twitter.com/v_rin701/status/776423165454983168) please watch him bounce :(

- In the final section, Cha Tae-hyun [found an old recorder](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/776420193647984640), playing back his birth and him growing up. I liked this part, seemed really sweet... Waiting for subs to come out.

But the thing is, there are so many groups that have incredible dancing and choreography that's just as intricate and difficult as the kind of stuff Bangtan does, even if it's not the same style! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpnMfohoe0o) Vixx performance comes to mind. 

But even as I can acknowledge just how freaking awesome some choreo is from other groups, I never get that kind of special ""wow"" feeling that I get watching Bangtan choreo. Obviously some of this is my (huge) bias speaking, but Bangtan isn't infamous in this area for nothing. 

So what *is* it? What's that special thing about their dances that makes us all so impressed, because I know there's something, I just can't put my finger on what levels their choreo up!",35,29

Britney especially seems really clunky and half-assed and soulless. I can forgive Beyonce, because she still has a killer voice, and Lemonade is pretty much a revenge record and concept album. But I tried to watch the AMA performance and it left me cold.

There's more options than ever in the music industry, but there's this weird vacuum of entertainment that they seem to want to fill with spectacle and pyro rather than technique. 

By all means, correct me and turn me on to new artists if I'm missing something. My teen to college years were mid-80's-early 90's who is doing the middle-aged thing where I'm listening to stuff that I listened to in high school and college because I CAN'T STAND local radio. A lot of people here listen to country and classic rock. Too many people my age are aging metalheads who ONLY listen to Rock and Metal...just like high school. You know those old balding guys who wear a ponytail and have a beer gut, wear a leather vest and a bandanna and mirrorshades, who ride really loud motorcycles? Yeah. Probably my former classmates.

I wind up listening to BTS, a few other KPop songs, Alternative from 89-95 (Nirvana and Bikini Kill, The Muffs! I miss The Muffs), old-skool hip hop (Midnight Maurauders), New Jack Swing playlists, GarageMysic/Psychobilly - I bet Tae would love The Cramps...

This is probably a terrible rambly post. Reel it in, BigWords.

POINT BEING, are there any artists outside of the KPop and JPop genre performing at this level? I don't even mean just acts that dance. I feel like since the advent of autotune, the commitment to quality of craft has degraded.

Craftsmanship! BTS is committed to hard work, quality, and craftsmanship, to the point of exhaustion. I just don't see anyone else doing that.",29,26

Firstly, I think he has such a unique voice, kind of growly and scratchy. Also, compared to the latter two, he doesn't have as much experience in rapping, and yet he has such a sick flow. I like the way he modulates his tone and makes his rap almost musical? The best examples of this are in Moving On and Cypher Pt 3. His sense of musicality from his dance background really lends itself to his rap. 
My understanding is that he never did underground rap or rap before BTS. Given that, I think he holds his own and his lyrics are pretty good. 
Anyway, end of my ranty rant. I'm not even Hoseok-biased, but just wanted to gush about him. ",17,86

* [Jin](http://bts.ibighit.com/darkwild/photo/jin-1.jpg): I know everyone lost their shit when Jin went blonde but I loved his hair in the Dark &amp; Wild era.

* [Hobi](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7719aa6363d7c4598dbb0f0420030cad/tumblr_o6tlnkD2FD1u6e79zo1_500.jpg): I couldn't appreciate J-Hope's handsomeness until his forehead was exposed and you could see his whole face. Bring Forehead Hoseok back omggg.

* [Namjoon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmlyEx8WYAAxqVZ.jpg): He has done so many colors that I love but his solo Youth promotional is my favorite cut, color, and style. I could be biased because purple is my favorite color but I think it's beautiful on him. I don't understand why it wasn't around longer! /*cries*/

* [Jimin](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/dd/c8/f3/ddc8f3b1ce328842460f7961df1bbe61.jpg): Blonde Jimin is pretty freaking great and I am so glad it finally happened but I can't get Orange Jimin out of my head. That look was just so good for him.

* [Taehyung](http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/11875373_1481294962165306_1838886365_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTA2MTk5MTUyMjE1NTU3NjAyNg%3D%3D.2): I love Tae with lighter hair and the part in this style is so perfect and I like it when his hair isn't pinstraight.

I feel they are so much fun that I am asking myself ""is it because I became fan of BTS, or are these contents actually attractive enough to ruin this random person?"" What do you think?

Q. V app has this whole lot of interesting videos and trying to get subscribers by promoting stars like BTS. Do you think it could work ok for foreign fans, too? I mean, I sometimes feel sorry for non-v app users because the contents of BTS there are so attractive that I hope more people see the vids for BTS' popularity sake.

&gt; [...] What about doing some kind of survivor competition between the songs? [...] I suck at explaining stuff, but I'll try anyway: the idea is to find what are the subreddit's favourite and least favourite songs. Starting from their first album, we vote on the song which we want to be eliminated on strawpoll. And one by one, the song with the most votes gets eliminated, until there's only one song left (the survivor). And then we do the same thing with the next album, and then the next one, until we have a survivor for every album. In the end, we can even do a competition between each album's survivors. [...]


This comment got quite a few upvotes and some positive responses as well, so I decided to start preparing it! But first of all, I wanted to ask everyone else's opinion on how we should organise this event.


So, first of all: **should I be the one the host the survivor?**

I don't mind doing it, but english isn't my native language, and most of you already realised that my grammar is not really perfect. But as long as you all don't mind my occasional (read: very frequent) mistakes, I have no problem in hosting the event.


Second; **should we count Intros/Skits/Outros as songs?**

In my opinion, I think we should keep all intros/skits/outros. I feel like most skits are going to be eliminated in the first round, but even so I think it's only fair to keep everything. Skits also deserve to be loved, lol.



Third; **should we take out songs which are in more than one album?**

For example, let's suppose that I Need U wins the survivor on both HYYH pt1 and HYYH YF -- isn't that kinda... unfair ...? So, shall we remove songs which are in more than one album?

Also, what should we do to outros which were later released as full length songs (House of Cards, Love is not Over)? Should they be removed as well, or be counted as two different songs, since the outros are shorter?

In my opinion, we should keep ALL repeated songs, except past survivors. So, let's say, if INU wins the HYYH pt1 survivor, and RUN wins the HYYH pt2 one, the HYYH YF poll will have all songs (including those from pt1 and pt2), expect INU and RUN.


Fourth; **how long do you guys think each round should last?**

I've looked up and apparently some subreddits do a round a day, while others do a round every 3~5 days. I think that we don't have enough redditors to do a round a day - we would probably end up with very little votes, but maybe 2 or 3 days per round are already enough for everyone to vote. What do you all think?


Fifth; **what songs/albums to include?**

I think we should start with their korean discography. If people end up liking the survivor, then we might move on to their japanese discography, their covers, Namjoon's and Yoongi's mixtapes, etc, but for now let's not get ahead of ourselves.


Do you agree with what I said? Or do you have a different opinion? If everything runs smoothly, we'll soon have the first round of the 2 Cool 4 Skool Survivor :)",38,41

I just wanted to know if any of the people who bought ""tickets"" (they sold $70[?] shirts instead of tickets) got refunded, especially those who went to the Atlanta show.

Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

Prepare yourselves to fight ^(in a peaceful and orderly way) for the honour of your favourite songs. Hope you all have fun!

Before starting the round, I'd like to give a quick recap on the rules of the survival competition. After reading everyone's comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/53texq/rbangtan_survivor_preparations/), I tried to make up rules based on the majority opinion:

- We're only doing their Korean discography (for now)
- Intros and Outros count as songs, but Skits won't be included
- Remixes and alternative versions won't be included
- Each round lasts for 2 days

Skits and remixes/alternative versions will probably have their own bonus rounds after we've done the survivors for all albums.

As for repeated songs (which are in more than one album), there were mixed responses on whether they should only be included with the original album they first appeared in, if they should be kept with all albums, or if they should only be taken out if they were chosen as the survivor for a previous album. I'd appreciate if you all voted [**HERE**](http://www.strawpoll.me/11281406) on which of these options you prefer, so that new rules can be established when the first duplicates start appearing.

And now, let's get to the good stuff - *the voting!* **Please make sure you have heard all songs before doing so!** I've put youtube links for the songs/MVs in case you want to give them another listen.

I feel like Suga probably isn't dating because he's all about the music right now. Jungkook is really still pretty young and you don't often see teenaged or even 20 year old couples in Korea (or at least I don't).  It's usually after 20 that people seem to start feeling the pressure to date. I really have no idea about J-Hope or Jin.

What do you think?

A question for veteran Army (especially those in the US): Which website do you pre-order your BTS albums from? I'd like to order from some place that would count towards the Gaon chart to help BTS while still getting a first press edition album. I've heard of kpoptown, kpopmart, and yesasia. Do you guys have a preference?

If I'd like to order several albums to just support them, is it better to buy them all in one place, spread them out, or it doesn't matter? 

On the other note, I've read that [international fans might not want to pre-order, but should coordinate orders with when fan signs are announced](http://www.ksoulmag.com/2013/11/support-korean-music-groups-overseas/) because the additive effect would help.

Reminding you all that this is a game to determine which song we like best from each album. All you have to do is
#vote for the song you like the least.
Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

Last round, the majority voted for *Intro: 2 Cool 4 Skool*, which got eliminated with **72%** of the votes. Which song do you want to eliminate this time?

Even though more than half of you didn't vote for the duplicate songs poll ^sighs, I decided to close the poll anyway because the results were pretty much decided already. **51% thinks repeated songs should only be included with the original album they first appeared in**, and so that's the rule we're going to stick to.

As for the voting, **please make sure you have heard all songs before doing so!** Be sure to give the songs another listen if you need to.

I've been in the ARMY since the Danger era, but I've bought all of their songs digitally. Now that the bts official shop has an English site, I really want to support the boys through those means. The album art is very appealing, and I like the idea of having something physical for their newest hits. My issue is this: I don't have a CD player or a computer that can read CDs. I know that nowadays, lots of physical albums come with mp3 download codes. Does BigHit do that? I really want to buy the album, but I don't want to have to buy the songs twice (I need to save money to buy more merchandise of course). If they don't do that, how do you guys get your songs onto your devices? I just don't use anything other than mp3 anymore.

The first day of the real sales, they sold some 40000 copies.)

The other day I've heard her talking about October 10th in the hallway and I obviously FROZE and was like ""What's happening on October 10th?"" Of course she said ""Comeback Day!"" And I got so excited!

Now she's been a lot more attentive. You know, ARMY's gotta stick together!",22,49

Though I'm sort of suspicious of Tae and Jin since they're wearing hats...
and Jin looks like he's wearing a wig; (his sideburns seem to be a different colour...he also looked like he was wearing a wig during the Chuseok Vlive)





[Yoongi](https://twitter.com/suga930309com/status/781793290177814528)
Black hair is back :')

[Taehyung](https://twitter.com/TAETAELAND/status/781797423068749825/photo/1)
Can we all take a moment to appreciate his perfect brows? 

[Joonie](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtmLFWlUkAA8xB-.jpg)
I like the styling here better than the concept photos :)

[Jin](https://twitter.com/19921204net/status/781794022314553344)
I love you Jin, but I'm not convinced that's your real hair..only a couple days left until we get slayed with another reveal that is as shocking as Blonde Jin

[Jimin](http://i.imgur.com/VhBhyrD.jpg?1) Looks more silver irl than in the Concept Photos...(man, I kinda wanted strawberry blonde Jimin a bit longer...it was too short-lived..he still looks amazing though)

[Hobi](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ctl5dodUMAAED8z.jpg)
Bright hair to match his bright personality ^ ^ Hope they will free him from the mushroom styling though

[Jungkook](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ctl5vsUUIAAS2ua.jpg) His hair colour looks a lot more vibrant than in the Concept Photos

EDIT: Tae has fluffy blonde hair and he looks amazing; if only they'd sweep his hair so that it would show his forehead like at the festival today ",14,39
