I price the items above by charging what I paid+approximate shipping, so the prices aren't negotiable. I'm selling these to break even, not to make a profit. I'll ship these out via USPS. Thank you for taking your time to read my post!  
**Edit:** The estimated shipping price is calculated for U.S. buyers. If you live outside of the U.S., it will be more expensive.  
**Edit 2:** I'm still working out the details of most of these orders now, but as of right now, 2 Cool 4 Skool and Young Forever are the only things people haven't offered to buy. I'll update this post when I get payments for the albums/posters.",5,17

To be clear, I'm here as a regular user (and not a mod) right now to ask about an idea I just had. Obviously, I was inspired by /r/kpop and their awards to make some fun year-end awards of our own!  

I was thinking of having it all be fun, non-serious categories that the community can come together to vote on, things like:  

1. Best performance  
2. Best outfit/hairstyle (could do this by member but that could also be a LOT)  
3. Best BTS meme  
4. GIF of the year  
5. Best BTS moment (also best Jin, Suga, RM, Hobi, etc... moment)  
6. Best Bangtan Bomb  
7. Best verse in a BTS song  
8. Tweet of the year (Separate best Bang PD tweet of year)  
9. Best V Live  
10. Best non-official track/cover on soundcloud (barring mixtapes)  
11. Lyric of the Year (a **single** line from a BTS song)  
12. Best variety show appearance  
13. Best fancam  

etc. etc.  

I don't want to do any serious categories like ""Best BTS song"" or ""Best solo"" or something because things like that, imo, get a bit too competitive and angry. I think doing fun categories that people don't usually do is a better idea \^^  

I'd also probably run this similar to how /r/kpop ran their awards, with the thread in competition mode and accepting nominations from everyone.

So, what I want to know is:  

1. Are you interested in something like this?  
2. What other categories do you think there should be?

I'm also going to use this post to say that we're looking for someone to do the masterpost for the Gaon Chart Awards on Feb 22 ! [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/liveperformances) more info on what making a masterpost entails (its not as daunting as it looks). If you're interested, PM me :)

I was inspired by /u/chintyawn's [Ringtone thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5rtds1/bts_ringtones/) and some of the awesome ringtones ARMYs have... 

So I was wondering if people would be interested if I were to compile a Google Drive folder of ringtones/text-tones? It takes me 2 minutes or less to clip the sound and export, so it wouldn't be a hassle at all. I'm not exactly sure how adding custom-made ringtones works on Android devices, only Apple, so if someone knows how, I'd be glad to credit them for their input!

If you're interested or have any requests, leave them below and I'll update with links and how-to's later! :D

All of the categories have a description in the voting thread for them.  

Upvote the nominations you think should win (there's no limit)!  

Don't reply to the nominations in that thread. All discussion should be in this thread; the links above are purely for voting.  

Let me know for next year what categories you think are missing. (I didn't do any best outfit categories because we'd need to do one for each member, but there's already 32 categories. And I didn't do any member-specific ones for the same reason; I figure they also fall under the ""Best [member] Moment"" category!) Also leave any questions and discussion about the awards below~

Therefore we really need to up our demand for BTS! Despite the fact that we have this campaign it isn't enough on it's on.. We need to constantly show demand through social media (Twitter, V-app, Facebook etc).

BTS's comeback is in less than two weeks so that also gives us an opportunity to STREAM their album CONTINOUSLY to get them on the UK charts again! This will help us massively!

Anyway I won't go on aha, I'll make a tweet about it on Twitter for everyone!

So the place which they're more likely to come is London since in MyMusicTaste London is at its 90% while other places like Paris are at 85%. If you could assist to the concert in London click Make here and let's make our dreams come true! Let's remind them that Europe exists!

On 10 O'clock chart,  BST was 11th, with many other Wings songs ranked in the 100 chart. I hope i-army feel happy with our effort, as we have been with your efforts!
* I am sorry for not having posted about Korean fandom for a while. I will try to leave information.

edit) BST has been 30~40th on Melon recently, which itself is amazing if we remember Fire was almost out of chart after 2~3 months from its release. Now with the drill, BST is staying 1~3 on 5min charts, and we are expecting all other Wings songs (not solo songs) lining up on charts expecially at tonight's dawn.",29,98

I was watching After School Club ep.191 and in one of their quiz (around 40:00) the question was:"" What's your idea of perfect style for Rap Monster? and one of the options was ""Pink"".  
  
What caught my eye was that he was wearing a Juventus t-shirt, in particular the 2015/2016 away kit.  
As an Italian and a Juventus fan, I found it somewhat ""strange"", but I also wanted to know why one of my favorite artist is wearing a t-shirt of my favorite football team.
  
I actually found no answer, just more questions...  
  
Music Bank COMEBACK / 2015.06.26, this time Suga wears another Juventus t-shirt.  
It's a day and an half that I'm trying to come up with a logical answer, but I can't really find it, so I hope someone will help me.

  
Side question: I also found out that MONSTA X in the MV ""Rush"" wear various Football t-shirts (Juventus,Milan,Argentina,Arsenal), so my question is: Is football really that popular in Korea? Or there is another reason?

I'd been holding out for an announcement for a while, especially as a concert organiser on FB hinted at a popular group coming soon... which today was revealed to Got7. I don't think I'll be attending but its exciting nonetheless.

The boys DID come in 2015 and I was lucky enough to attend despite not being that of big of a fan back then. It was actually attending that concert that solidified my love for them!! (If they were to come again I'm curious as to where they would hold the show).

Please let me know if this has been discussed elsewhere and I'll remove it, I'm just kinda bummed. But we're still in early days now guys! Which other locations do you think are likely? 

[Personally, I don't think the 'scandal' that took place towards the end of the TRB tour (and which originated in Australia) has anything to do with a lack of dates, but my friends disagree. Thoughts?]",18,13

1) There was a section in my textbook titled ""Choosing a Basis"" but I read it as ""Choosing a BIAS"" (not quite related to BTS but they're like the only kpop group that i love so.. i associate ""bias"" with BTS) 

2) I had to look up what boron carbide can be used for and one of the common applications is for BULLETPROOF vests and i was immediately shook and started singing We Are Bulletproof, pt. 2 out loud

3) Growing silicon crystals produces a silicon boule, which is pronounced as ""bul"" as in BULTAOREUNE, *fiyaaaaahhhhhhhh*

i'd really like to hear about your theories of what the upcoming album concept will revolve around.

we all know that from the photoshoot they are at a bus stop and the bus schedule lists some of their previous songs. but we missed one MAJOR symbol.


paint. yes thats right, paint splotches. it is everywhere in the photoshoot pics, and it is also everywhere in their BST mv, their previous concept film shorts, some of their previous photoshoots.


i think this might be something to do with the symbolism of painting one's own life, perhaps its an allusion to how they are all painting each others lifes together.

another clue is the extreme opposite of the concept. wings was originally very dark and gloomy, but this one is particularly happy and bright. perhaps in the previous concept they are exploring their darker sides, and in this repackage they are exploring their lighter sides.

In Korea, BS&amp;T was really successful. If you remember, I often talked about the male-centered site that I frequent, where people said,'BTS? who are they? are they famous"" even right before their wings come back. But with Billboard &amp; UK chart success, BTS was on news so many times, many became curious about BTS, and they found their songs so high quality and dances perfect. Male fans or people who feel good about BTS have grown in number. Some even call them the sons of that (male-centered) site (one of the most loved male groups of the site) rather grudgingly, because their names are so much mentioned there, and favorably. In other sites where other group's fandom attacked Army so cruely with Sajaegi or plagiarism (so easily attacked as they outnumbered us (still they are)), BTS fandom and its activity has apparently grown and now we are not helplessly being attacked. We successfully fight back with factual data to protect our guys. To fill Gochek Dome two-days in a row is not an easy task, but this time the concert ticket is so hard to purchase. In so many ways, BTS has upgraded their status in Korea last year. No one denies now BTS is one of the most successful groups at the moment. Maybe this short passage is not enough to sum up their wings activity. Maybe other K-army visiting here can leave better summarization. 

Now, how has been in your countries and online Kpop fandom? Good things and bad things combined, what has been your impression on their Wings activities? I really wonder whether they can fly higher!",41,44

I'm pretty new to reddit (although I did post a bit regarding my university) so it's really nice to meet you all! My bias is Suga but RapMon has been climbing my ranks after I found out he was also a Murakami Haruki fan! My favourite is 1Q84 but I've seen him reference Kafka on the Shore and possibly Norwegian Wood. As a huge fan of BTS and classical books, I was just wondering if there were any more that RM has either suggested himself or relates to BTS at all. So far I have:

-Demian (Hesse)

-1Q84, Kafka on the Shore, Norwegian Wood, Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, etc. (I pretty much have every translated Murakami book)

-The Metamorphosis (Kafka) (thought it was interesting how the butterfly theme is so prevalent in their MV's and Kafka just had a book called 'The Metamorphosis'... I thought 'this can't be a coincidence!' until I actually read the book and then pretty much deduced that they have nothing to do with each other.



Some others RM has recommended:

-Me Before You (Moyes)

-   ()

-   ()

-Walden (Thoreau)

-The Stranger (Camus)

-The Catcher in the Rye (J.D Salinger)

-Almost Transparent Blue (Murakami)

-If I Knew (Kirberger)

-Sky, Wind, Star, and Poem ()

-     ()

-   ()

-   ()

-Snakes and Earrings (Kanehara)



He has a really great yet diverse taste in books and a lot of them overlapped with my own books. I've been seeing a lot of Frederich Nietzsche quotes here and there so if anyone could recommend me a book that's by Nietzsche and is quoted by BTS, that'd be great too! (I've already read Thus Spoke Zarathustra).

**Also, if you have a book that you think I may like (or RapMon, since we seem have similar tastes), please recommend it to me! Some others he hasn't mentioned but were my favourites include 1984 (Orwell), The Chrysalids (Wyndham), Being and Time (Heidegger), The Giver (Lowry), Being Mortal (Gawande), Outliers (Gladwell)... and more, but I just can't remember :( thanks ARMYs!

This thread was created because I've been seeing a lot of misinformation about BTS on different sites. I can't help but cringe when i see inaccurate facts be up-voted hundreds of times especially in YT and Twitter where there are lots of new fans who could see it. 

1. Bighit is a subsidiary of JYP Entertainment.
&gt;[Bighit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hit_Entertainment) was never a subsidiary of JYP. They only co-managed 2am in 2010-2014 and BangPd used to work there but that was it. 

2. Taehyung was the last member to join BTS.  
&gt;Nah. Taehyung was the last member of BTS that was *revealed* to the public. Jimin was the last to *join* the line-up. [He joined May of 2012](http://kimmy-trans.tumblr.com/post/129090504691/hanryupia-2014-january-issuecatch-up-with-bts) 

3. Jimin's parents own a cafe in Busan. 
&gt;Jimin's parents do not own 'Alice Table' anymore. They used to manage it but according to fans and [@papercrowns](https://twitter.com/papercrowns/status/612195298702561281?lang=en) it was sold to a relative in 2015. To those who are planning to visit, don't expect BTS merchandise/displays because they're no longer there.

4. Jimin's brother.
&gt;It was never confirmed. Someone has claimed that this [man](http://data.whicdn.com/images/234460972/large.jpg) is Jimin's brother and this has been widely circulated among international fans. However there's another [picture](https://68.media.tumblr.com/6991137910c1db7b187da3301e235339/tumblr_o79sao7Y9I1v59v1to1_400.jpg) which is obviously that of a different individual. Additionally, there were fans who insisted that the first man was just a random dude. 

5. 'BTS hates white people'
&gt;There's no evidence,proof, indication to this claim. I'm far from being white but I hope fans STOP spreading this. 

6. Wings: YNWA is a scam.
&gt;NO! Other group's repackages only have 1-2 new songs and we got 4 which is more like a mini album for other kpop groups for example: Gfriends' Season of Glass has 4 songs &amp; 1 instrumental, Twice's TSB has 6, Vixx's Kratos and Hyde both have 5 songs &amp; 1 instrmntl, Ukiss' Mono Scandal has 4 &amp; 2 instrmtl and many more. (google is my friend)

7. BTS' involvement on their songs is only limited to the rappers writing lyrics for their rap parts. (r/kpop and everywhere)
&gt;I hope no fan believes this. New ARMYs may want to see this [Compilation of BTS' Writing and Producing Credits.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3i6jjVAkVS1UVRVeTVWaDRRQzA/view)

8. BTS suddenly got popular.
&gt;Their climb to the top has been gradual as seen/reflected trough this [compilation](http://onehallyu.com/topic/252478-bts-general-sales-thread/). Users here can expand on this matter and insights from pre-debut fans up to now will also be appreciated. 
&gt;I've observed that comments like this are usually from non-fans who have been downplaying and denying BTS' increasing popularity and claim that their current status was obtained by luck. 

9. J-hope has been a jyp trainee. JYP had sent him to Bighit.
&gt;He did audition but there is no confirmation that he trained there. This was discussed more on the comments below. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU80O-fostU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m30s) by user/meanyoongi where RM stated that no member trained in another company before they got to Bighit.

10. Confusion on Rapmon's heart surgery pre-debut.
&gt;There were conflicting claims regarding this topic but I found someone who compiled screenshots of Rapmon's friends posting about his heart surgery [here](http://hoseokjung.tumblr.com/post/96034940428/do-you-know-anything-about-the-whole-rapmon-heart) and [here.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn01sn) Maybe a fan can kindly ask peachisoda or other bts translators about this matter. *copied and pasted this from my reply below.

146,2017-2-10,2017,2,10,1,5t0tx0,Crazy YNWA theory?,dentedwing,1486656379,"Sorry if someone already said this... :)

So in Omelas, a brief summary would be: It is a happy utopia society.                        
But the only reason why they can be happy is because a small child is sacrificed. This child is forgotten, abandoned, and mistreated alone so that Omelas can be happy.

We can think of Jin being that miserable child who is locked away, because of how Jin is portrayed in previous concepts. But my (really insane) theory isn't about the story of these albums, its more about real life issues.

In the story of Omelas, everyone knows that 1 small child is made to suffer for their happiness. But most people ignore this guilt and continue living happily. Some, however leave the city of Omelas in pursuit of Justice, as they are unable to accept that this child has to suffer for their happiness.

So what could the child symbolise?

The child could symbolise Creativity.

Omelas could symbolise the ideal Idol Career, the ideal idol life. It is the career where your group stays popular forever, you always earn money, you always have good sales, you always sell out at concerts, and you always remain popular. You are popular and mainstream, even.

But many times, in order to achieve this, you must sacrifice creativity. Sometimes, even if you write a song with the most meaningful lyrics, or the most amazing meaning, it may not sound good enough. It may be rejected because it doesn't sell.

But BTS doesn't do that. They shit on the government in Am I Wrong, and they have sung and rapped about society, and going against it. They rarely give up on their artistic freedom in order to sell and be successful.

BTS walks away from Omelas, the ideal life, because they will not and they will never sacrifice their Musical creativity. They refuse to conform in order to achieve success.

And that is why they all walk away from Omelas. [Note: In the story, the people who walk away from Omelas walk alone]

But, to tie this strange theory with the album's title, you need to bring in ARMYs, and even BigHit ent itself.

Because BTS has the support from Bang PDnim to be creative and write freely, BTS is able to have the confidence to walk away.

Because BTS has ARMY, a huge fandom that will always appreciate their music, whether it be popular or not, BTS is willing to risk losing that ideal career and success and follow their hearts and dreams.

It is with the support of each other, the staff and the fandom that gives them strength to leave Omelas for a better place.

And that is why we walk together, we never walk alone.

You Never Walk Alone.

Ok, so that's it and honestly I think it's a really crazy theory, but my friends said it was somewhat reasonable lol. Hopefully it doesn't sound too pretentious or weird :')",20,68

I just feel like my ramble is a bit out of place among the teaser analysis because this isn't really about the specifics of the video. I just wanted to take a second to reflect on bangtan's influence on me and many of my friends over the years. 

So I've always had a pretty vested interest in counterculture movements. I suppose this stems my background; I'm an immigrant and a racial/ethnic minority within my very homogeneous town. Though I've lived here for nearly a decade, I'll never be able to escape this feeling of ""otherness"" (sorry, I'm not really sure how else to describe it). Now, over the years I've come to view diversity as a positive thing and learned to embrace my culture, but growing up, this wasn't the case. Basically, as soon as I understood that there were things about me that were different from others and that I would never be able to change them, I became a very unhappy child. This also happened to (or I predictably, I suppose) coincide with my coming of age and first exposure to actual hardship. Not a particularly great combination. But then bangtan came along. 

Today, I can identify the sort of juvenile quality of some of bangtan's earler stuff (NMD, NO, etc), but back when I was 14, all of it resonated with me. I was angry and often times didn't know why I needed to go through school just to enter a society that in my eyes encouraged people to take advantage of those who were already marginalized. Does this sound like suburban teenage angst? Yeah. But that doesn't negate the fact that at the time, what I was feeling really upset me and made me feel helpless. I felt like bangtan understood that. And for once, the coming of age story they told didn't pander or talk down to their audience. They were teenagers themselves, talking about their own, genuine opinions. Seeing how bangtan approached their issues is something that really got me to change my outlook. Whether they were [encouraging people to vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4J5sRsRfdE) or [bashing the korean education system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sby_6W_I0dQ), they've never shied away from actually *giving a shit* and doing something about it. Most people take their anger and learn to accept things as they are, but they didn't.

Then comes bangtan's growth alongside my own. I think everyone on this sub can agree that HYYH is something else entirely. While it's fun to delve into the details of the era (who's dead? where are jin's shoes? what is the significance of bathtubs?), the more important aspect of their last two years has been the same overarching theme of youth. But this time around, their approach is was more nuanced. They chose to tackle both the hardship and beauty associated with growing up. One of the reasons I can basically never stop thinking about bangtan is that they've addressed a ridiculous amount of stuff that goes on in my life. [Having to work actually work my ass off for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM), [finding comfort in my friends when things go south](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wn85Ge22FQ), [but still loving this part of my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBj4y9Zibao). They've acted like role models for me as I've matured with them. 

In the last year, it's become clear that political sectionalism and its repercussions will be the most significant issue to plague my generation. I live in the US. Once again, bangtan's message rings true. While it would be so much easier to ignore the news or become complacent, [that's just not in our nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwlYEB7qpNo). Bangtan encourages us to speak for our morals and reminds us that we'll never walk alone while doing so.

I don't exactly mean a red herring. I definitely think it'll play a part in the story, but only partially. In the Spring Day MV teaser, we've only seen it as the sign and/or name for a motel. Considering we might still have to worry about how Demian is incorporated in the side/supplementary story, I think Omelas will be used as symbolism, as a small part of the story, or only as a literary reference (well they already got me to read the story, but I don't mind, heh).

There's also the possibility that WINGS is going to be another trilogy like HYYH, and that they're saving up either Omelas or another piece of literature for the finale.

[Here's the link to the awards if you haven't seen the stickied post yet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5s3wxo/rbangtan_awards_2016_nominations_and_voting/)  

I also have some slightly bad news.  

In hindsight, 32 categories is a *lot*. So I understand that not every category is going to have a ton of participation. If I decide to do this again next year (and it's doubtful because it was a lot of work and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of participation...even in the categories everyone seemed excited for in my initial post). I'm probably going to delete all the categories from this year with minimal participation in it (meaning not a lot of nominees, and not a lot of votes).  

To put this in perspective, the entry with the most votes from any category has 21. The second most is 16. Yeah. Not a whole lot of people are really voting or nominating things...even if you don't have a lot of time to nominate things, voting would still be good!  

So. Here I am, imploring you all to save these awards I put so much effort into. The categories with the least number of nominations are as follows (some are understandable, some aren't):  

* [Bang PD Tweet of the Year](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/5s3fe3/bang_pd_tweet_of_the_year/) [3 nominations]  
* [Best Jungkook Moment of 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/5s3gow/best_jungkook_moment_of_2016/) [3 nominations]  
* [Best J-Hope Moment of 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/5s3ge0/best_jhope_moment_of_2016/) [4 nominations]  
* [Best BTS x ARMY interaction of 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/5s3gsa/best_bts_x_army_interaction_of_2016/) [4 nominations]  
* [Best V moment of 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/5s3gl7/best_v_moment_of_2016/) [5 nominations]  
* [Best BTS x Idol Friendship Award 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/5s3i6z/best_bts_x_idol_friendship_award_2016/) [5 nominations]  

Honestly, all of the ""Best [member] Moment of 2016"" have waaaay too few nominations except for RM and Suga. You can view how many nominations each category has by looking at the [/r/bangtanawards subreddit as a whole](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/) and the number of comments each category has (a bunch of categories only have 6 nominations which is why I cut it off at 5. But 6 is still pretty low tbh...).

We summarized KAPS' mission down below, but you can read more about the organization from their [Korean website](http://www.koreananimals.or.kr) or their [English FB page](https://www.facebook.com/KAPSAnimals).

KAPS is a Daegu-based animal shelter (they actually have 2 Daegu shelters) that has been open since 1989 and a non-prof since 1991. Their main goal is to rescue animals from the likes of abuse, meat trade and the dangers of the streets, while also raising awareness about animals to the youth and general public in Korea. They provide a safe home to all rescues as long as needed; that is, until they are adopted. However, due to the increase of animals, they can no longer take in more rescues. They are still looking for volunteers and donations in the form of pet food, money, toys, and other pet necessities.

Since we can't all travel and/or coordinate and international care package, we are going to do a money donation. You can donate whatever amount you feel comfortable with, we're not putting a minimum requirement for this one.

You can read the guidelines for donating [here](http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png), most importantly, **dont forget to add username / SUGA Project / preferred way to credit in the comment box** before sending your donation [to us](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs).

We have decided to use any excess donations to make a donation to KAPS in Suga's name. KAPS is the Korean Animal Protection Society, and we will be making a donation to their Daegu shelter. Suga has previously talked about wanting to volunteering to help homeless dogs, which is a huge problem in Korea, so we have decided to pick a charity to address this issue which is dear to him. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Hello my lovely jasmins! As you can infer from the title, we are ready to begin Suga's birthday project :) We just finished printing (and shipping!) both the census books and the J-Hope compilation; so, please anticipate the closing posts for these projects.

Hello! I know how much of a pain it is figuring out how music show voting works, so I decided to compile a guide here to detail how to support BTS in getting more music show wins (and so I can see my [OTP](http://68.media.tumblr.com/24aba1f5bc1f06bde8c11b44e74a6b47/tumblr_ohkue26RBk1qhmfcoo3_250.gif) of [Suga](http://66.media.tumblr.com/112f0ff274da307f6b4bc7c9486be4c1/tumblr_o0n6mrQ2Yl1s8hxm5o3_250.gif) [x](http://gifgifs.com/res/0516/57364c0ad0941666240177.gif) [trophy](http://33.media.tumblr.com/7a6ff1961076d15ef1c6e23b1ba7de93/tumblr_nnzap9U9JT1tkj9elo4_250.gif) once again. Annoyingly, each music show has it's own rules and ways of determining the winner so I'll detail it all here for this round of promotions. (If I've left anything out please let me know~!)     

##Tuesday: The Show  

##**NOTE: Voting is not open yet.**  

###Voting Breakdown by %  

PRE-BROADCAST POINTS BREAKDOWN:

1. Stream on Tudou as much as you can! [Link here](http://music.tudou.com/theshow/index.html). Click on the orange button next to their name and stream the video! ([Pic](http://imgur.com/A0H1zuw)). Same rules as increasing the view count for the MV on youtube; using incognito works best.    
2. Twitter points. Go to Twitter and post tweets that contain @SBS_MTV # #. All three of those have to be included for the tweet to count. You need to have words in between each of the tags. For example: ""@SBS_MTV Can't wait for # to win on # ! Go BTS!"" Also don't attach pictures/video to your tweet. Do this as often as you can!  

##Wednesday: Show Champion  

##***NOTE: Voting is closed.***

2. Buy a physical copy of YNWA if you haven't already.  
3. Stream ""Spring Day ()"" on Melon! This is difficult outside of Korea, but [here's a tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDUzz2p79XOkUxtHxduLZLq1etERLwwQGI96wDYuVeY/edit) for making a Melon account if you're interested. (NOTE: If you don't pay for a Melon streaming pass ([which you can buy here](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/830434121226735616), or [heres a guide for how to do it from iTunes](https://bangtanintl.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/tutorial-how-to-purchase-melon-streaming-pass-through-itunes/)), your stream won't count. The free preview doesn't help. Also you only need to stream the song once per hour, as it only counts each stream once per hour. [Full guide for how to make sure your stream counts on Melon](https://bangtanintl.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/tutorial-how-to-stream-songs-on-melon-app/), [heres the (translated) K-ARMY streaming guide to Melon!](http://www.peachisodaworld.com/2017/02/misc-170212-you-never-walk-alone-bts-1.html)

[Tutorial for voting](http://friedeggkingdom.tumblr.com/post/117691513481/how-to-pre-vote-on-melon-for-bts-inkigayo) (Note: need a Korean phone number to vote).   
4. Increase the MV view count  

##Other things that help too:  

* Increasing the view count on the [ibighit channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeFrLSkMm8)  
* Searching """" or "" "" in Korean search engines like [Naver](http://www.naver.com/) or [Nate](http://www.nate.com/)  
* Donate to the [YNWA project](https://twitter.com/YNWA_PROJECT/status/826744206731288576) to help bulk download the title track!  

#Help BTS rank on Billboard!  

###Hot 100 Breakdown by % (though it varies a LOT, read more [here](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work)):  

* Sales: 35-45%
* Airplay: 30-40%
* Streaming: 20-30%

*Note*: All of the following will only work if you are in the USA, or use a VPN to be in the USA. If you do this from outside the USA, it wont count towards Billboard; it will only count towards your own countrys chart.  

To explain, airplay (which means mainstream radio airplay) will be difficult. ARMYs will probably organize a project for radioplay when it comes out; though its very possible to rank on the Hot 100 with zero airplay (you just wont rank near the top, lol. Our goal is only to get on the list tho; ranking is irrelevant).  

10 downloaded tracks = 1 album, and 1,500 plays on Spotify, Rhapsody, Tidal, Rdio, Beats, Google Play, Apple Music, Amazon Prime, Pandora and others + Youtube, Vevo = 1 album.  

###What to do:   

* ***[Donate to the Strong Power, Thank You project!](https://twitter.com/BTS_Spotify/status/827066663342202880)*** &lt;- read this thread **even if you cant give money**; it has info about many other things you can do to help BTS get on the Billboard Hot 100! Also if you arent able to pay money, theyre gifting the songs to people for free, you just have to sign up!    
* [Buy the album on iTunes digitally](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/you-never-walk-alone/id1204716563) (if you cant do that, then just buying the title track () for $1.29 also helps a lot!)  
* Stream the title track on Apple Music. You can use the 3-month free trial of Apple Music if you havent already, or you can pay $9.99/month to use it. [Here's a comment explaining how to change your iTunes to be set in the USA](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56jsmh/pann_161008_wings_streaming_tutorial_other_things/d8kcays)  
* [**STREAM ON SPOTIFY!!!**](https://play.spotify.com/album/64WayBZ9Mrx8iGOpME5vpI) - Spotify is free to download/listen, youll just have to listen to ads every so often. Its best to focus on streaming just the title track. [Here's a guide for streaming on Spotify~](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4M2D5CUEAE5n_b.jpg). If you want to leave a playlist running in the background, you can just leave it streaming on loop!      
* [Increase Youtube views!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeFrLSkMm8) (This is the only thing you can do from outside the US and still have it count, haha. Details below).  
* If youre able to stream (legally) on any other site like Rhapsody, [Tidal](https://listen.tidal.com/album/70296880), Rdio, Beats, Google Play, Pandora, or Amazon Prime, do that too. Though idk if BTS will actually put their music on any of those places, lol. Lmk if they do~   

##Best way to increase views on Youtube    

* [Heres a nice graphic with a bunch of tips =)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4M2D_rVUAAsk9_.jpg)  

Additionally:  

* Doing this on different devices (as in, your phone, tablet, computer, apple watch, your mom's computer, smart TV, any device that can access youtube) will help a LOT! (make sure you aren't logged into the same account on all of them though)  
* Send it to your friends to get their views in too! Share on social media! Every click counts~  
* Try to clear your cookies/youtube watch history every so often. [Heres how](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?hl=en). Alternatively, you can just close and re-open your incognito browser to do the same thing.",26,151

I'm sure a lot of you have watched these sorts of things before, but when WINGS released I was still a very new ARMY (only a few weeks!) so I didn't even know about it haha. What goes on in these types of things? Is there content I will enjoy without needing to understand what they're saying? Or would it be better to wait until it is subbed/will it be subbed? I want to join in with the hype but I also need sleep haha, though luckily I don't have work tomorrow!

Thank you! :)

250,2017-2-13,2017,2,13,1,5tmapj,It`s all about Zarathustra,BangtanTree,1486917388,"Now after the ""Spring Day"" MV is released, we have more informations about the BTS-MV-Story.
So my theory is, that its all about ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" !
""Thus spoke Zarathustra""  is a philosophical novel by  Friedrich Nietzsche about the  homo superior (the ideal human -&gt; Nietzsches theory).
The raw concept of the ""homo superior theory"" is that an ideal human surpasses the borders of an normal human. And every normal humen want to become an ideal human. Zarathustra talked about the ideal human in the same part of the novel, in witch the quote ""one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to 
a dancing star"" (you can see this quote in the BS&amp;T MV). So my theory is that all members of BTS try to reach the next step of human being (the ideal human).
You can see that some BTS-members try to kill themselfs in the  Spring Day MV. Suga is trying to kill the devil in the fire MV. J-Hope trys killing himself with the pills. 
etc. --&gt; They try to become ideal humans!!!
And Jungkook/Jin/Jimin are the only ones who reaches the next step of human being, because they realises first (you can see this in many MV as well in Spring Day) that something is wrong in the world (the world of Omelas).
--&gt; And in the Not Today Teaser Jungkook,Jin and Jimin are the only members escaping from fate (black persons), because they are now ideal humans.

Here you can read the complete novel: https://archive.org/stream/thusspokezarathu00nietuoft/thusspokezarathu00nietuoft_djvu.txt

Thx and what`s your opinion?

I miss you

Saying this words makes me miss you even more

Even when I'm looking at your photos

I miss you

Time is so cruel

I hate us

That us who can't even look at each other's face for once anymore

This place is covered with winter

Even in August, winter comes

My mind chases the time

The lonely Snowpiercer

I travel to the other side of the earth while holding your hand

I wish I could end winter

I wonder how much longing emotion should fall like snow for spring day to come

Friend

Like the tiny dust that flies in the air

If I'm the snow that's flying in the air like the tiny dust

I would be able to reach you a little faster

The snowflakes are falling

They're falling little by little again

I miss you, I miss you

I miss you, I miss you

How many days should I wait

and how many more days should I stay up 

to see you, to see you?

Will I be able to meet you? Will I be able to meet you?

After the end of the cold winter

Until spring day comes

Til the flowers bloom

Please stay there for a little more

Please stay

I wonder if you have changed

I wonder if you have changed

Or if I had changed

If I had changed

I even hate the time that's running this very moment

I guess we have changed

I guess that's what happens to everyone

Yeah, I hate you. You've left me

But I have never forgotten about you even for a day

I honestly miss you

But I will now erase you

That's less painful than blaming you

I try to blow you away 

Like smoke, like the white smoke

I say I'm going to erase you but

I couldn't send you away yet

The snowflakes are falling

They're falling little by little again

I miss you, I miss you

I miss you, I miss you

How many days should I wait

and how many more days should I stay up 

to see you, to see you?

Will I be able to meet you? Will I be able to meet you?

You know it all

You're my best friend

The morning's going to come again

No darkness, no season can last forever

I guess the cherry blossoms are blooming

This winter comes to an end too

I miss you I miss you

I miss you I miss you

If I wait for a little longer,

If I stay up for a few more nights,

I will come to see you, I will come to see you

I will come to take you, I will come to take you

After the end of the cold winter

Until spring day comes

Til the flowers bloom

Please stay there for a little more

Please stay",13,38

I think we all know what BTS was trying to do with Spring Day's message now. It is obviously a song &amp; video that is intended to be a message of hope for people who feel lost, struggling through life, have lost someone, have suicidal thoughts, going through depression, or just having a hard time feeling alone.

We know #youneverwalkalone is trending worldwide...but let's extend that message of hope a little more.

So let's make a support thread of Hope! Let's spread the #youneverwalkalone message. Feel free to come here to let off some steam and talk about the things that make you feel sad, angry, or if you miss someone...or you feel a bit overwhelmed by the MV today. Let's help each other out more, let's love each other a little more. 

Even if we are all strangers on the internet, if theres one thing that BTS taught us is that we are all in this together and we are not alone. So lets talk openly about our problems... from one ARMY to another. Who knows, maybe we will find someone who understands.i know how much ARMY means to me and how much it has helped. 

#youneverwalkalone !

This is the National Suicide Prevention Hotline (for those living in the USA). Alternatively, there is an online (chat)[http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx] if you aren't comfortable speaking over phone.

I'm not very familiar with any suicide hotlines outside of the USA, but this seems to be a reliable [list](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html)

If you are having a hard time in your life, even if you are not feeling suicidal, reach out to someone. Life is crazy, sad and bittersweet but we're all in this together. The morning will come &lt;3

But, I would really like as many opinions on this as possible!

I've been writing for years, and always try to push my skills to get better and better. I've never written stories involving real people, so I would like to start with trying to write about these precious boys who've helped me in my health recovery for the past few months. I'll take pretty much anything regarding accurate personalities, small quirks/habits from the members, or even what certain members have a tendency to call other members. As many opinions as possible would be very very helpful, as I don't think I've paid close enough attention to trust only my judgment for these kinds of things.

So.. yeah! I'd love to hear what you guys think! Thanks in advance for the help. c:

Due to unfortunate circumstances, I can no longer go to the concert. If I can't go, I would really like someone to take my place!

Here is a [picture of the ticket](http://i.imgur.com/vYJQ22A.png) with some of the ticket covered. Also, I covered the seat, but you can PM me for it :) I don't know enough Korean to know if the ticket can be copied/ stolen from a picture. (sorry)

BUT. It does say the time, date, place, section, and row!

Here is [proof from my ticketbis account](http://i.imgur.com/JEb3ZiA.png) as well.

I figure the easiest way to do this is to have everyone leave one comment about BTS if they're interested. It can be anything! Your favorite video, moment, what BTS means to you, etc. I'll use a random number generator to choose the winning comment. 

Submissions will be open until 6 AM (GMT / UTC +0) Wednesday.
I'll be shipping the ticket via EMS as quickly as I can to make it in time for the concert! 

I hope someone can go! &amp;amp;amp;lt;3 

EDIT: Hey guys! My work schedule changed, so the new submission deadline is 3 AM GMT! Sorry for the short notice!

EDIT: Submissions now closed! I'll pick the winner now!

CONGRATULATIONS CherlynAurora ! You are the [random number](https://i.imgur.com/QAhDpyi.jpg) winner! &amp;amp;lt;3 I'll PM you!

I'm 29 and live in Canada. I got into BTS a few weeks ago. I have a friend in Japan who has been trying to get me into them for a long time, but their old albums never appealed to me. I became interested because of FIRE MV but Blood, Sweat and Tears (and silver haired blue eyed Jimin) pushed me over the edge. I've been free falling since! Jimin is my bias, and I've got a thing for Vmin! 

I've been into Kpop since 2012. Big Bang is my ultimate bias group but since BTS is so much more active, things my shift around, dare I say?

In the interest of keeping the sub clean, since there are so many different submissions about sales and record data floating around right now, I just want to remind you all about the [YNWA achievements megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/) that was made on the first day YNWA came out. Please put all sales/record data in there from now on.  

The only exception to this would be an *extremely* notable new record that they break which they have never broken before (for example, the 'first kpop group ever in top 10 of itunes' would be considered notable, as would something like getting in the Billboard Hot 100/Album 200 and can have its own submission). Things like Youtube records, album sales, etc. should just go into the megathread.  

/u/Eren_ has added a link to the YNWA achievements/theories thread at the top of the sub for your convenience! [Here is where they are located](http://i.imgur.com/foCZvbG.png). If you want to discuss theories about the MV, please go to the theories megathread as well!

I don't remember the name of the fic, obviously, but I do remember a few things about the plot. It was based in the INU era, and the members all had interesting occupations. Jimin was a busker, I believe Taehyung and Jungkook were homeless ruffians, Yoongi was a hitman, RM worked on cars, and I can't rememer Jin or Hoseok's jobs. I believe the author was in the military, or something of the like, because they would talk about staying in barracks. I know it's not a lot to go on, but any help is greatly appreciated!

We'd like to start by thanking you guys for your kind words left in the Suga birthday project post. They are very kind and encouraging; thank you ,really. 
 
Now onto the main purpose of this post! 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Okay, so I have to start off by saying that this was one of the most ambitious sub projects we've had so far. Our goal was to compile enough uplifting and encouraging material (messages, fan art, pictures, quotes, poems, etc...) for J-Hope to read daily. However, we fell short of our 365 goal. Which was is not really a big deal considering we still managed to receive 184 entries in just 2 weeks time (really short time frame for such a big project). Thank you to all our many contributors that sent in stuff for the compilation! And, I wanna give a big, BIG (!) shout out to all of our lovely volunteers who ever so patiently helped us sort through all the material sent in! 
 
While we would like to show you guys the full version of the compilation, for privacy reasons, we will on show you the [template](http://imgur.com/a/7NlF4) we used for the book to give you an idea of what the book looked like. Many of the messages were deeply personal and beautiful, so we will keep them private. If you'd like to see how your entry looked as a final edit, PM us with an email address where we can send you the pictures.  

As we have usually done with past compilation projects, we bought J-Hope a gift! Well, it was actually a donation in his name. We wanted something solar or light theme, since J-Hope is sunshine incarnate, so we bought [solar lanterns](http://donate.worldvision.org/solar-lantern) for families in need. Even though World Vision is a religious organization, they help all people, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender. We believe that as long as people in need are effectively being helped, that shouldn't matter much. 
 
To let J-Hope know about the donation, we will be attaching [this small card](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-glAyKLOxKaaOBFLR) at the end of the compilation book. 
 
Thank you to all who contributed to the J-Hope project in helping us inspire, encourage, and cheer on J-Hope. 
 
Ah! Did I mentioned the books arrived in Korea? Here's a picture of [the book wrapped up](http://i.imgur.com/iG7OMPt.jpg) and ready to be mailed!

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you once more for participating with us! We hope to see y'all again soon :)
 
Sincerely,  
The BTS Projects Team 

&amp;nbsp;

____ 
 
P.S. Entries are still open for the Suga birthday project! Please see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tb88e/sugas_birthday_project/) for all the links. Like the J-Hope project, we will be making a donation in lieu of a gift with any excess donations; we have decided on the Daegu shelter of KAPS (Korean Animal Protection Society), because Suga has previously talked about wanting to volunteering to help homeless dogs, which is a huge problem in Korea, so we have decided to pick a charity to address this issue which is dear to him. Please also look out for the final post for the census book very very shortly!  ",7,77

I was kinda bored so I thought ""Why not listen to the song and try to make something with it"". Listening to the song I could here a nice repeating segment in the chorus. I immediately wanted to make a 10 minute video and repeat that segment. Soooooo, after about 2-3 hours of rendering and uploading the video is finally up on youtube.

This is going to be a brief post with more info about the Suga birthday project. As you can read from the title above, we are extending the deadline for the project. Our (unusually gorgeous) team is confident we can extend the deadline and still be on schedule. Please be aware the new **submissions deadline is Wednesday the 22nd at 11:59 PM [US CENTRAL time](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com)**. And, if you'd like to read [the guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tb88e/sugas_birthday_project/) in depth.

You can use [this submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeoND17YeZwSZRi-fnLhcVjH5bS390191XsOSFKg_Tper1zEg/viewform) to send in messages. However, we've been made aware that some are having issues with the form; if that's the case for you, please email us your entry at armysunite@hotmail.com with the **subject line [MSSG] SUGA birthday project submission**. Make sure to [specify how you would like to be credited](http://imgur.com/by2sQA6).

&amp;nbsp;

As with previous projects, we will be pairing a gift with the book. And because in the past the sub seem to be more driven towards community service and charity, this time we will be making a donation to KAPS. We summarized their mission down below, but you can read more about the organization from their [Korean website](http://www.koreananimals.or.kr) or their [English FB page](https://www.facebook.com/KAPSAnimals).

KAPS is a Daegu-based animal shelter (they actually have 2 Daegu shelters) that has been open since 1989 and a non-prof since 1991. Their main goal is to rescue animals from the likes of abuse, meat trade and the dangers of the streets, while also raising awareness about animals to the youth and general public in Korea. They provide a safe home to all rescues as long as needed; that is, until they are adopted. However, due to the increase of animals, they can no longer take in more rescues. They are still looking for volunteers and donations in the form of pet food, money, toys, and other pet necessities.

Since we can't all travel and/or coordinate and international care package, we are going to do a money donation. You can donate whatever amount you feel comfortable with, we're not putting a minimum requirement for this one. As always, please read [these guidelines](http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) for sending in donations (**dont forget to add username / SUGA Project in the comment box**) and you can send your donations [here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Since we are making the donation together as a sub, we have a different guideline for donations. The **deadline for donations is Thursday March the 2nd at 5PM [US CENTRAL time](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com)**.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope we didn't confuse you guys...but if we did here it goes again :)

* Extended **SUBMISSIONS** deadline: Wednesday February the **22nd** at **11:59 PM** US CEN

* **KAPS DONATIONS** deadline: Thursday March the **2nd** at **5:00 PM US CEN**

You guys can use [this time zone converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com) to convert the deadline to your timezone.

And as always, feel free to PM us any questions! Alrighty, that's it!

A few people were commenting on BTS's lack of ability to lip sync properly, which is completely true. 

Rap monster has got to be among the worst idols at lip syncing in the industry next to TOP from Big Bang. Personally, I don't care though. I find it so funny that this group has had 4 years to figure it out and still fails. The reasons I don't care though are that it means they don't lip sync that often and fans are never fooled by when they are lip syncing versus pre-recording vocals because it is so blatant. ^Sometimes ^I ^wish ^they ^would ^get ^it ^right ^for ^the ^music ^videos ^though.

For me, I don't mind the title ""I-Army"".....cause frankly, that is what I am. I'm still an ARMY, just easier to differentiate between the different groups of ARMYs around the world. Just like how we are all really people of the planet Earth, but we still recognize ourselves by nationalities.

It's cheaper for me to buy digital because shipping and conversion increase singular album prices by about $10 each but I've wanted to buy physicals for sooo long. 

Is there any proof that one is ""better"" than the other? And does streaming from services like Spotify or Apple Music have an impact?",6,12

Both types probably have different moments where they saw different charm points and sides of BTS. As a newer fan, everything is a learning experience for me, and I feel each time I watch a new video, I learn something new to love about BTS. It also helps that no one else was a fan of BTS or kpop before me in my group of friends, so I ""fell"" for them for mostly my own reasons. I didn't intend to like each member that much, the part that drew me to them was mostly their appearances and dancing, but their personalities really made me stay.

Bonus drama: [Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.co.kr/678337) just posted something about how BTS' stage looked exactly like BigBang's 0to10 Concert stage, or something to that extent. They even started a hashtag #__ which is asking BTS to apologize for ""copying.""

And at long last, we're proud to share the digital version, in both Korean and English, of the census book! We sent both editions to BH and they have received the books. Here are some photos of the book, both [wrapped up to be shipped](http://imgur.com/XPyl7YX) and the [books themselves](http://imgur.com/9VduFGq).

We had 796 responders to the census survey, 50 commenters and 11 illustrators from 64 different countries who participated in this project. This was an incredibly ambitious project, and we're so happy to see it come to fruition! But we couldn't have done it without all you guys.

We want to give a big shout out to: 

* our tireless translators, who worked so hard in making the Korean version! Thanks for putting up with our often frantic requests, and for doing this almost Herculean task. 

* volunteers who helped out with data collation of the short answers and of the comments! You guys were so helpful and worked so hard, we couldn't have done it without you~

* the coordinators, who worked hard on this project!

* the mods of /r/bangtan, for being so supportive of this project! Thanks for making /r/bangtan a beautiful and wonderful place to be :) 

* the illustrators, who produced such beautiful artwork!

* everyone who commented in the discussion post. There were so many lovely comments that we couldn't include, and we're sorry that we couldn't include them all. We wanted the comments to reflect the census results and to include as many commenters as possible; we were able to include everyone who commented! 

* everyone who participated in the census; without you, this project could not have been possible! 

* everyone of /r/bangtan: thanks for being a wonderful community, and the impetus of this project!

We hope you liked how the project turned out! Please look out for our Suga birthday closing post in the coming weeks, and for our future projects, as they come. Also, thank you for all your support of our projects thus far! It really means a lot to us :) 

&amp;nbsp;

With love, 

The BTS projects team

Their backup dance crew seemed to be aiming at them and winding up some sort of artillery, like in [their Intro Perf. Trailer](https://youtu.be/S1Up-ZzHmuw?t=5m14s). If the crew really is representing some type of artillerary, can someone inform me what it is? I'm a bit curious, both Not Today and Spring Day seem to have a lot of ""imaginary"" moves, or dance sequences where the boys seem to be telling a very clear story. If anyone else has noticed very interesting moves, like when Hobie [""broke through""](https://youtu.be/r3NHiiIhEoc?t=1m50s) the wall the crew was making or when the guys locked arms at the end of Not Today, do tell.

Can be official and unofficial stuff; criteria is open - can be based on aesthetics, best deal for money paid, etc. 

I've been collecting CDs so far, but I'm so tempted to join some group orders because the fansite goods are just so pretty. My favourite item so far definitely has to be HYYH: Young Forever. The packaging is just beautiful and the concept was pretty nice overall~ also doesn't hurt that some of my fav songs are on the album!

689,2017-2-25,2017,2,25,13,5w2drp,Feelings about Korean music shows/BTS on them,madbsy,1487997635,"Okay, can I get on my soap box? I invite all to please join me if you feel so inclined. If you disagree, please comment down below. I would love to have some dialogue about this! :)

I have always had so many feelings about Music Shows. Now that I'm living in Korea, I'm able to watch the live streams at a reasonable hour! But now that I'm watching during Bangtan's promotional season, I have watched the whole show and I'm feeling more strongly. After talking with my friend who's an idol (every time I say that I feel like I'm name dropping ~~cringe~~ but context is necessary here) I have even more feelings. Side note: these are things that also happen in the Western pop industry and I don't like it any better there.

1. I feel like they take away a lot of the artist's artistry. To me, BTS is far beyond this KPop idol life. Their music and their social opinions as a group are bigger than this. Definitely not downing KPop artists, but the industry itself is not made for individuality or innovation. It is made for following the flow and hoping that your version of the same flow gets you famous. FAME is the big thing here. That's why BTS works, because the go against the grain in hopes of being different and being innovative and always being better than themselves, not just being popular. Of course for them, gaining fame is a factor. However there's a difference between being famous for the sake of fame, and famous because of great music.

FYI the rest of these are not just about Bangtan.

2. Music Shows happen back to back to back to back to back during an idols promotional season. I honestly kind of hate watching them because you can see the exhaustion on their faces. It's heartbreaking almost. We know that they're barely sleeping. We also know that backstage, many companies provide a few raw vegetables for their girl groups and Pringles for their boy groups. We know that the cute videos of them napping all cuddled up backstage is actually because they were up all night practicing or have low energy because they had to starve themselves that day. Everyone knows. It's kind of like the child in Omelas. Everyone knows it's there. They just choose to ignore for their own happiness. (Another theory??)

3. The idols become dolls/puppets, but not people. This is the part I hate the most. Most of the people cheering in the live audience aren't there because the music is great. They come to cheer on the characters that their idols put forth in order to remain as idols. When their idols break that character and become human, that's when backlash happens. BTS is always showing their human side (or at least their really good at acting like they are. For the record I genuinely don't think they're acting.) and that's why they work. But I hate seeing other idol groups forced to become less human on music shows. 

If I was an idol, I think promotional season would be the worst. I know that BTS has to do music shows to keep up with the KPop idol world, and I'm glad their promotional periods have been consistently short. One day, they won't need it. I guarantee! When I was first getting into KPop, I started following a bunch of groups. But because I don't agree with the K-Idol company lifestyle, I found it hard to continue supporting certain artists knowing that they were suffering. But BTS seems different. They're always full of life in their stages and BH treats them like kings and they don't put on a face when their not feeling it because they're not forced to. Oh and their music is great and original and has a purpose. Now that I can get behind :)

TL;DR: I don't like music shows. I think they're dehumanizing across the board because they:
1. Effect people's health and mental well being
2. Take away from music/musicians
3. Turn people into dolls/characters
However, I know they are necessary for in the KPop industry.

TL;DR part 2: I just want to hug all the idols and trainees and let them know that they don't need this and that they are talented and smart and valued for who they are beyond their looks and outside of this messy industry. (I have a few middle schoolers that want to be trainees and my heart is just like NO.)

Ending with a conversation between my friend and I:
""So would you recommend that other musicians do this KPop thing?""
""No. Never. I would tell them to stay away while they still have the chance. And a lot of other more well known idols I know have talked to me about the same thing. But once you get it, there's no turning back.""",81,84

I'm going to the show in Chicago and have steered clear of any fancams so that I don't spoil too much for myself. I'm thinking of buying merch though, more specifically the hoodie + the cap or beanie. BigHit's Facebook post doesn't show the physical items at all though, only digital renderings, so it's hard for me to grasp how the items look like in person.

I've also heard a lot of times that pictures don't do them justice, and that Jimin looks different in photos. A few weeks ago, I met a social media star who I've been following for about a year and a half ago and she did look a bit different irl but even better - and I wonder if its the same with Jimin. The usual accounts I hear are - Yoongi is super duper pale, Rapmon and Jin are really tall, Taehyung is handsome and tall and Jungkook too, Jimin is sometimes tall to some and short sometimes too, and J-Hope is always bright and smiley and looks the same. It makes me anticipate if I ever meet them - just something I've been wondering and been curious about (especially about Jimin, he's my ult!).",39,141

I've been lurking this board for about a few months now and I see lots of devoted/loyal/dedicated followers here. It's really nothing like I've seen before.

What puzzles me is the amount of loyalty that I see across the BTS realm. Whenever there is good news that occurs for the group, the whole community becomes ecstatic. I'm not talking about just being happy for them in general; compared to other 'devoted' fan bases that I've seen: Justin Bieber, One Direction, Taylor Swift, etc. this definitely takes the cake. I've seen hundreds of thousands of followers promote anything BTS related through social media and real life.

I'd really love some feed back on my article, so I can get better, if any one is willing to spend the time reading it. I promise that at the very least it's a different opinion on the styling than you'd expect for this music video.

I KNOW I've seen it before, but I can't seem to find any trace of it... was it all some elaborate fever dream?

It's a video where the guys are eating and Namjoon sticks two pieces of food up his nose. I've searched the Bangtan Index and all the Bombs and I swear *to christ* I must be missing something. Does anyone have ANY idea what vid this is from so I can finish this stupid video?",13,14
