Ok so basically, I ordered the album on kpop mart. However, I when I was ordering it, the only option was NO POSTERS. However, the description says the photo book and poster is included inside the album packaging itself. So, did I order it without the poster? I don't really mind if I did not order it with the poster BUT I MUST HAVE THE PHOTO BOOK HAHA. So help fellow ARMY with this stupid question :(

So ""FIRE"" or ""BURNING UP"" ... ([Here is the link to the audio ver. only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abwVf2kpIag))

New MV was released today...

***Now forget about the MV for a moment and just think about the song and give your honest opinions here...***

**Don't be afraid of giving unpopular opinions...**

*Thanks!*
***

######MY Opinion:

Honestly ... this song ""compared to other songs of this album"" ... was *meh* (In MY humble Opinion...).

This song gave me ... BigBang's BANG BANG BANG vibe... especially in that ending... (Just sayin'!)

But I guess this song will grow up on me slowly ... And I will start jamming after some days!

Just that ... I will not say that this was bad ... this was ACTUALLY good! Just that compared to other songs ... It kinds felt meh to me...

Also ... [remember this? (PINK FLOYD)](http://cadependdesjours.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Wish-you-were-Here-Cover.jpg)

Thanks!

However,  I discovered they'd be coming here June 9th so I had another shot at seeing them, but somehow I can't find any site that sells tickets.  

Does anyone know how to get tickets for their non-NA country locations? Also, if anyone else is from Taipei and wants to go hit me up so we can go together.

**Update:** Thanks to playlisthoarder's helpful replies I compiled a rough translation for anyone interested in going to the Taipei BTS concert.

Anyways, it's obvious a lot of people feel that Save ME ends abruptly and there was even a post where OP had edited a final chorus fading into silence (Which is awesome btw, great work). BTS (as a whole, not just the members) knows what they are doing. I'd say the end is intentional because what you want most for an MV song is replayablility (not a word i know). When the song ends, i'm sure all of us were like ""NOO i wanted another chorus to be 'satisfied' "". It's genius honestly, an effect that absolutely makes you want to replay the song again and again! Just my thoughts! A great song regardless!!! Would love more of the tropical house sound from them! (And they had it a bit in FIRE tbh)",2,26

Hello! I know how much of a pain it is figuring out how music show voting works, so I decided to compile a guide here to detail how to support BTS in getting more music show wins (and so I can see my OTP of [Suga](http://66.media.tumblr.com/112f0ff274da307f6b4bc7c9486be4c1/tumblr_o0n6mrQ2Yl1s8hxm5o3_250.gif) x [trophy](http://33.media.tumblr.com/7a6ff1961076d15ef1c6e23b1ba7de93/tumblr_nnzap9U9JT1tkj9elo4_250.gif) once again). Annoyingly, each music show has it's own rules and ways of determining the winner so I'll detail it all here for this round of promotions. (If I've left anything out please let me know~!)     

##Tuesday: The Show  

##**NOTE: Voting hasn't opened yet.**  

###Voting Breakdown by %  

* Album sales + Digital sales + SNS (Korea) (35%)  
* Tudou music video views + pay vote items (China) (35%)  
* Live voting (for *The Show* Choice nominees only): Total 30% (15% Korea text votes, 15% China Tudou votes)    

###What To Do:  

1. Stream on Tudou as much as you can! [Link here](http://music.tudou.com/theshow/index.html). Click on the orange button next to their name and stream the video! ([Pic](http://imgur.com/A0H1zuw)). Same rules as increasing the view count for the MV on youtube; using incognito works best.    
2. Twitter points. Go to twitter and post tweets that contain @SBS_MTV # #. All three of those have to be included for the tweet to count. You need to have words in between each of the tags and in front as well. For example: ""Hey @SBS_MTV Can't wait for # to win on # ! Go BTS!"" Also don't attach pictures/video to your tweet. Do this as often as you can!  

##Wednesday: Show Champion  

##***NOTE: Voting has closed.***  

###Voting Breakdown by %  

* 45% Digital Sales (Melon)  
* 10% Physical Sales (Hanteo)  
* 15% Ranking from Netizens  
* 15% Ranking from Professionals in Music Industry  
* 15% Points on MBC Music Broadcast  

###What To Do:  

1. Vote for BTS on the Show Champion page. [Here is a tutorial](http://fyeahbangtaned.tumblr.com/post/143756786229/how-to-show-champion-prevoting) for how to do that. You can vote 3 times per day; so make sure to use them all every day! (note: It's changed since last time. You have to use an app now).  
2. Stream ""Fire ()"" on Melon! This is difficult outside of Korea, but [here's a tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDUzz2p79XOkUxtHxduLZLq1etERLwwQGI96wDYuVeY/edit) if you're interested. (NOTE: If you don't pay for a Melon streaming pass ([where to buy here](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/727061076810960896)), your stream won't count. The free preview doesn't help. Also you only need to stream the song once per hour, as it only counts each stream once per hour.)   

##Thursday: M!Countdown  

##***NOTE: Voting is closed.***   

###Voting Breakdown by %  

* Digital Single Sales (50%)  
* Album Sales (15%)

4. Increase MV view count!

##Friday: Music Bank   

###Voting Breakdown By %

##***NOTE: Voting has closed.***   

###Voting Breakdown by %

* Digital Ranking: 60%  
* SNS Points: 35%  
* Viewer Pre-voting: 5%  
* Real-time voting: 10% (Top 3 candidates only)  

###What To Do:  

1. Stream on Melon! (see above)  
2. Inkigayo Pre-voting (need a MelOn account to do this. [Guide](https://bangtanintl.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/tutorial-how-to-make-a-melon-account-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9-%EA%B0%80%EB%8A%A5%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/) for that.) [Tutorial for voting](http://friedeggkingdom.tumblr.com/post/117691513481/how-to-pre-vote-on-melon-for-bts-inkigayo) (Note: need a Korean phone number to vote).  
3. Tweet using # and #!  
4. Increase the MV's view count  

##Other things that help too:

71,2016-5-3,2016,5,3,14,4hlvtf,Fire &amp; Dope are opposite sides of the same coin,smileyman,1462253946,"Something I realized tonight while watching the Fire MV yet again.

Fire is the flip side of the coin to Dope, in both sound and meaning. 

In Dope the message was all about the boys working hard all day &amp; night while the rest of the world was off clubbing and otherwise partying. Because of that hard work they're awesome. Dope is all about swagger.

Some relevant lyrics from Dope:

    I worked all night every day
    When you were out clubbing yeah
    
    We're drenched, drenched, drenched
    In sweat, in our practice room
    All the weak, loser, whiny idiots
    They have nothing on me 'cause I'm full of hope

    We work over half the day
    Even if our youth rots in the studio
    Thanks to that we're closer to success

    I worked all night everyday
    When you were out clubbing, yeah

In Fire the message is basically the opposite. It's about not working too hard and not being too upset with failure. Instead the message is about taking it easy because they're young.

Some relevant lyrics:

    When I wake up in my room I'm just nobody
    After sunset I stumble when I walk
    I'm a wreck because I'm drunk, drunk

    I'm messed up! Like I'm a nut.
    All messed up. Livin' like beep

    Live your life. It's yours anyway
    Don't try too hard. It's okay to be a loser
    
    Make some noise! 
    Burn it up
    Let's burn it all.

    Turn it up 'til the dawn passes by
    We can just ride with the wave 'cause we are young
    What kind of spoon are you, talking to me like that?

I believe that this is why Dope was playing in the background when the MV started, to remind us of both the music and the message.

As far as the music goes, the sound in Fire is a pretty stark contrast to Dope as well. While Dope has elements of trap and EDM in it, they're more subtle. In Fire those elements are turned up to 11. Musically there are some similarities too. The horns in Dope are echoed in Fire by some of the EDM sounds in the chorus. The bass drum sound in the chorus has a very similar beat. The snare drum sound in Dope is imitated in Fire by the trap sounds.

One other thing I noticed. While the dancing in both Fire and Dope is fierce, in Dope it's more tightly synchronized, while in Fire it's much more loose. This is also true of the costumes and outfits. In Dope there's a definite theme (either the job related ones or the white shirts and ties), while in Fire it's very casual, where what you want sort of thing. 

Anyways, just thought it was interesting that the two tracks seemed to be opposites in many ways. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Fire was begun around the same time as Dope. Hell, it might have even been written about the same time and not included on the album because it was too similar in sound. Then not put on HYYH2 because you had tracks like Ma City and Baepsae.

One reason I think Fire was written around the time of HYYH1 is because of the ""what kind of spoon are you?"" line. It's the kind of thing that a songwriter would take and develop into it's own complete idea as in Baepsae. 

Edit:

For fun here's Jungkook and Jimin being inappropriate.

I've been really looking for the differences such as instrumentals, lyrics, etc, and I've seen part switching mentioned, too! Some are obvious and some are subtle, for example, in Love Is Not Over, there's added rap and the reversed vocals near the end was removed. 

Personally, I found the alternative mix differences pretty hard to pick up on, so I'm curious! 

What differences have you all noticed? 

Or is there anything you wish they would have done with it?

Anyway, we need to work together to secure BTS a spot in the HOT 100. If they get even the 100th spot, I would be happy for them. I mean, imagine how excited they would be especially since it was one of their goals. Luckily, they ranked 35th in the Top 100 songs in the iTunes singles chart, but unfortunately, they are dropping. That is normal. The song is not available on Spotify, so it reduces their chances. However, if you have Apple Music, stream on there. I think it counts. What you can do is watch their videos on Youtube since the chart also includes youtube views. 

So all in all, in order to secure BTS a spot on the HOT 100, here is what you can do: 
Buy the single on itunes, Stream the song on Apple Music, Watch the video on Youtube

If there is more, comment in the comment section below.

They stop compiling the info on Thursday so if you can, stream as much as possible and watch as much as possible before Thursday. ",9,22

If so what ones are now out?  For me Run Ballad, Young Forever, and Save me were all 5/5 A+ perfect, so I've done some organizing and here are my current top 10 songs.

**1.  Butterfly**  Still my favorite, has been since part 2 came out.

**2.  Run Ballad**  I have CRAVED this song since they released the part 2 photo shoot.  I knew it would be right at the top of my list as soon as I saw the track list for Young Forever (J-Hope singing lawd)

**3.  Dope**  My introduction to BTS, so it always has a special place in my heart.  Plus it's still my favorite bangtan choreo, I can't not love it.

**4.  What am I to You**  My favorite bangtan rap, hands down.  This song is so relatable to me, like god damn it hits me right in my heart.

**5.  Nevermind**  Suga's best performance.  Also super relatable, another song that you just feel regarless of language (though the lyrics are seriously fantastic).

**6.  I Need U**  Probably my favorite title track.  I really don't have anything negative to say.  Great rapping, great chorus, great choreo, great everything.

**7.  Young Forever**  I think I might just be a sucker for the emotional raps.  I love the rap in this and the slow build.  I love that it's Hobie that brings things to a climax and the soaring vocals are so impressive.  

**8.  Save Me**  This feels so fresh and contemporary.  I love the EDM direction BTS is heading with this song.  I am highly anticipating the MV and choreo, I'm sure it's going to be fantastic.

**9.  Cypher Pt. 3**  By far their most hype song.  I would kill to see this live, I'm sure it's unreal.  

**10.  War of Hormone** My favorite bangtan music video, it was the second one that I watched and really sealed the deal for me haha.  I really like how unabashedly sexual and teenager it is.  

Songs that were bumped from the top 10 are Run, Tomorrow, and Hold me Tight which hurts me to admit haha.  

So did Young Forever do damage to your top 10?  Tell me!

Recently, we have been getting many posts on Pann trashing BTS. If you follow KpopKfans and Pann-Choa, you will see those posts. Anyway, our boys have now been called plagiarism boys due to the many plagiarism posts happening recently. Also, if you search on Naver, the Korean equivalent of Google, Bts plagiarism, Bts Shinee and all types of negative connotations are the first results in the search bar. Not only that, but a hashtag spreading hatred against our boys has trended for several hours in Korean Twitter during the first anniversary of their first win. This might have repercussions on our boys. Let's not forget the Loser controversy that happened last year when BTS got their first win. For the boys' latest concert, antis are planning on trending a hashtag ""Plagiarism boys"" in Korean. Since they got to number one spot recently, it surely shows that this hashtag has a lot of backing behind it. Korean ARMYs have decided to counteract these hashtags by trending the following ones: #SAVE_ME, #YOUNG_FOREVER, #BTS (Burn it all, BTS), # (BTS you've worked hard), # (Fire), #  (BTS we love you). #  is the main hashtag that people are going to use. Last year, BTS were labeled as the Sajaegi boys, and now the plagiarism boys.  Hopefully, we tweet this trend enough that it becomes even bigger than the hate thrown at our boys. ",16,30

I intend on buying a P1 ticket for kcon ny (on whichever day BTS is performing). However, since the combo tickets go on sale 3 days before regular tickets, I'm afraid P1 will sell out during the combo sale. Do you think that is likely to happen, and if so, should I just buy a P1 combo and then sell the ticket to the day I won't be attending? Is that even possible? Thanks for the help!!",3,4

174,2016-5-9,2016,5,9,0,4ieuys,2016 HYYH On Stage: Epilogue in Seoul - Day 1 and 2 Fan Account,macritchies,1462719821,"So I went to the concert because it happened to fall on days I was backpacking in Seoul; how could I not? I did meet up with a few international Armys that'd flown over for the concert and we all hung out.

**DAY 1** 

I bought a ticket for Day 1 online via Interpark and it was in standing area A. But it was pretty shitty, because I was near the front and got squished a lot. And I'd been carrying a paper bag with albums, my wifi router, phone, an Army bomb and a program booklet, but because of the pushing around, the bag broke. I left the area because I couldn't handle it and lost everything except the phone; afterward, I only found my wifi router and everything else had been stolen. (Still lowkey pissed about the program booklet.) 

The pushing was really, really bad; people were fainting and I was a good few inches taller than all the other girls with a good view and I still wasn't okay with taking it. People were shouting in Korean and I was swearing in English, and my friend says J-Hope looked over at what was happening and just sorta... angled his head away uncomfortably. We ended up being lifted over the barrier by a security guard and went to the first aid area for a few songs (House of Cards, Love is Not Over all the way till Save Me). There were already quite a few people there.

We went back in when Save Me started and the angle wasn't good but it was a lot less cramped nearer the back. (People squeeze near the front and also the perimeter of the area? Because of the extended stage.) And everything is kinda a blur until Hip Hop Lover when the boys didn't have to do choreo any more and they just kinda ran around the stadium on the stage. Since everyone kept to the perimeter to follow the boys, there was this sizeable circle around us and me, with my lack of an Army bomb, was just jamming there; Jeongguk came near, likely saw the Giant Hole in Pit, made eye contact and started dancing. So that was fun. 

Don't remember much else from Day 1 except Cypher Pt.3 live is absolutely amazing. A lot of stuff you don't see on the DVDs as well, like how the boys interact with the backup dancers a lot. We left again halfway through their ending ment because the area was too cramped, so I missed the Jeongguk crying part.

**DAY 2**

I really didn't wanna leave on a bad note, so I reached the area at around 9am to try and queue for a ticket at the ticket box. The booth opened at 12pm but there was already a huge line formed in the park area, of all places, and people had set up mats and stools and everything. There were still quite a few tickets left because they didn't release all; not the best tickets, I ended up right in the most corner of corners, but I was in the fourth row and pretty close to the extended stage. [This was my view.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ch6gqecVAAAjFR2.jpg) Ended up queuing for about four to five hours? But I made friends in the line so it was pretty worth it.

Sort of knew what to expect already, but the angle really was bad and I couldn't catch some of the songs, especially those where they stood near the back of the stage e.g. Dead Leaves. Jimin came up really close during House of Cards, though, his mic stand really was just *there*. When the boys ran around they'd wave at us a lot, and like the day before they interacted a lot with the backup dancers. (The backup dancers looked like they were having lots of fun too, just freestyling whenever there wasn't choreo.) 

During Whalien 52, Taehyung started to tear up and he had to sing with his head hanging down. (Jimin teased him after that.) Young Forever was one of my favourites, it was super anthem-like; you could barely hear the boys' voices over all the fans', and it was gorgeous. 

In Miss Right, like the day before, they carried around little woven baskets with plastic balls in them and threw them to fans; some of them (Jin, I think? And Jimin and Taehyung.) kissed the balls before throwing them and holy shit did fans fight over those. On Day 1 we saw a really young girl with red eyes and one shoe and dirty socks sitting outside the corridor, and the guard said something to her and gave her two signed balls; I think she probably fought for them, *hard*. Anyway. On Day 2 I saw Seokjin kiss a bunch and throw them into the standing pit and, I swear, a five-meter radius circle opened up and it was terrifying. 

J-Hope also threw his water bottle into the crowd during Cypher Pt.3. Someone threw a towel into the crowd. Jeongguk and someone else (Seokjin, I think?) threw their caps into the crowd as well. At some point Jimin went down into the crowd to do something?? but not sure what. And I made eye contact with them (or tried to...) whenever they came near so that was fun. 

I Need U during the encore was really nice. They started off with a really short Urban Mix version where they basically did not sing at all; it was just the Armys singing the whole thing and you could see their faces on the giant screens and it was pretty emotional, not gonna lie. Then they ended off with the full, original version of INU. 

During the ending ment, Jimin thanked the members by name and sang a little song and cried, and this made the other members tear up too. And when they were going around the stadium thanking the fans, Yoongi did a deep bow, knees to the ground and head pressed to the floor, and just stayed there sobbing; Jimin went up to comfort him.

I also headed to the back of the gymnasium afterward to catch a glimpse of them and when they came out, most went straight to the car but Taehyung walked in a circle and waved at us for quite a while, and so did Jeongguk. [When the car drove away Jeongguk stuck his head out of the sunroof and Taehyung stuck his out the window.](https://twitter.com/V_kun1230/status/729285974857900032) There were a LOT of people waiting, some even drove their cars up to the barricade and sat on the roof. 

**A few notes**

* My Army bomb for Day 2 (a new one) had no batteries so I was kinda... silently jamming and standing up whenever they got near and dancing, so I probably looked a little out of place amidst all the other steadily bobbing bombs.

* The crowds are crazy, lots of international fans and quite a few fan boys as well. Fan clubs give away lots of free stuff before the concert but be prepared to queue.

* There were guys walking around in hoodies and masks of the boys (printed pictures, laminated, rubber bands around ears and all) and you could take photos with them, and they gave you free stickers too.

* Merchandise didn't run out super fast but program booklets definitely did. (Still pissed I lost mine.)

* They really start everything on the dot. Ticket box, concert, everything.

* A lot of fans are really, really young. Like elementary school young or even smaller. There was a little girl seated behind me with her mother on Day 2 and her mum just sat the entire time, but when she stood up to do the Army bomb thing she was only a couple of inches taller than the chair. 

* The boys look just as good in real life as they do on your computer screen, in photos, in videos etc. They look the same. Yoongi and Jimin look especially small, but all of them are pretty thin/lean. Yes, Jimin's booty and Jeongguk's thighs are just as they look in photos.

* My bias is (probably) Jeongguk so I pretty much kept my eyes glued to him the whole time, but Namjoon looks a lot more charismatic? attractive? in real life than he does in photos, and Yoongi in a white cap is very dangerous.

* I don't know how they do it, but they perform incredibly well. Everyone has great stage presence and their live singing is amazing considering the choreo that they're doing; they were really tired after Fire and Dope, definitely. Save Me looked intense too; that choreo is really, really nice.

* I couldn't understand a lot of the stuff they were saying because it was all in Korean, but it was pretty emotional and lots of people around me started crying, mostly during the ending ment. The boys bowed really deep at the end as well.

* Knowing the fan chants is good, but personally I liked singing the whole song with them, even if my throat was super sore afterward. It's definitely worth it to know what are the chants though, especially those moments where everyone is just singing/chanting together.

* Seating tickets are much better than standing. But if you want to try braving the bloodbath... go for it. I know some people who had a good time. 

* In the VCRs there were new tracks; pretty sure one was some kinda remix of INU, another was the one they used in the Epilogue teaser, and there was one more. They all sound amazing. 

* The boys really like to do the thing where they let the audience sing the lines, especially rap line.

**TL;DR** BTS is super attractive in real life, they can dance and sing and rap really well, great stage presence, amazing concert, potential river of tears, mini-dance party with Jeongguk, eye contact with the rest.   

I think that's it! Most of the stuff that happened has probably been posted on twitter somewhere or on the compilation thread that's right on /r/bangtan, so I'm probably missing a lot, especially since I can't speak Korean very well. Hope this has been thorough enough! Will edit if I suddenly remember something. ",14,36

Now my thought is that they did this on purpose to not date the main MV.  By date I mean that when someone 5 years from now clicks on the Fire MV they aren't going to see the dab and think wow remember that dumb dance from back in the day, kind of like we think of the dougie now.

Not sure if that was their intent, but if it was, I think it was a very intelligent thing to do.

P.S. I think the dab is kind of dumb, but they made it work in the dance ver. so ill accept if for now.",0,1

*Link*: [Yoongi Compliments Bangtan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24vX7i847o)


*Translation:*

**Host**: What does Jin's cooking taste like?

**Kookie**: It's bland

**Yoongi**: Uhh. It's just-

**Jin**: No, Don't talk. Jimin will explain

**Host**: Why won't you let Yoongi talk?

**Jin**: Because it never suits Yoongi's taste..His taste does not match well..

**Namjoon**: Yoongi's always so negative

**Yoongi**: Yeah, that's true

**Jin**: Actually, I've never seen him compliment anyone

**Yoongi**: That's because I-I-I tell people straight up what I think. For example, I'd tell them if something's not that great

**Host**: Are there any compliments you would want to give to your members?

**Hobi**: Oh~ this sounds like fun

**Jimin**: Shall we start with complimenting Jin hyung?

**Taehyung**: I feel like Yoongi hyung will just say things he doesn't really mean

**Yoongi**: Jin hyung is-

**Jimin**: Don't just say he's good-looking

**Yoongi**: Jin hyung is quiet

**Host**: Haha is that really a compliment?

**Jin**: Wow, what a great compliment

**Yoongi**: Yeah it is because I like it when it's quiet

**Host**: Yeah, being quiet can be a good quality


**Yoongi**: Jimin works really hard. He puts a lot of effort in everything he does. I really admire that about him

**Host:** What about Taehyung?

**Yoongi**: He's really energetic..so is Hobi...He gives me energy

**Hobi**: That's right..My role is to be like a battery charger

**Host**: What about Namjoon?

**Yoongi**: He's very responsible/dependable

**Hobi**: Because he's the leader

**Yoongi:** Jungkook is too energetic/hyper..

**Host**: Too energetic?

**Yoongi**: Yeah, I wish he'd be less energetic - But this is a compliment, because I'm never energetic. But, he is too energetic-Sometimes, it gets overboard


**Host**: How about we compliment Yoongi now?

**Jin**: He is really quiet/calm when he sleeps

**Host**: *LOL* How is that a compliment?

**Yoongi**: When I sleep, I wake up exactly in the same position.

**Jin**: He's my roommate, and when he sleeps, he is very quiet

**Hobi**: Jin is really sensitive when sleeping. (His sleep is easily disrupted)

**Host**: Oh, so it's good you guys are roommates. How is Jin when he sleeps?

**Jin**: I'm also very quiet when I sleep

**Yoongi**: When all seven of us slept in one room..it was really- Well, at first, I was a really light sleeper, but this soon changed after having us all sleep in one room.

**Host**: Our Jungkook is the youngest, right?

**Kookie**: Yes

**Host**: Let's hear our maknae compliment Yoongi

**Kookie**: Uhh..

**Host**: Say something other than Yoongi sleeping quietly

**Kookie**: Uhh...


**Host**: He's just ""Uh""?

**Kookie**: Uh..Oh! I have one. I have one I have one-

**Host**: What is it? What is it? What is it? 

**Kookie**: Yoongi writes good songs

**Jin and Audience**: Wow

**Host**: That's really good..but how about something that is related to his personality?

**Kookie**: He's not loud

**Host**: So he's really quiet-

**Hobi**: Yoongi does this thing where he pretends not to care, but he'll secretly take care of us

***Taehyung pretends to be Yoongi giving water with swag haha***

**Hobi**: Even when he gives us water, he doesn't make eye contact ***acts like he's giving a water bottle***

**Host**: Why do you do that? Is that a concept?

**Yoongi**: I'm not really sure why..I think my personality just resembles that of my father...He would always take care of people without saying anything outright..and when I was young, I thought that was really cool/admirable



***Taehyung continues to act like a dork and imitates Yoongi giving out water bottles***

Music Bank has 65% Digital Music Charts as criteria

And tonight we won by just a few hundred points against Twice. It was like 5000 pts versus 1700+ points when it came to Digital Single Sales. That's a whopping 3300 point difference and given that 65% tomorrow is much higher than the 50% Digital part criteria tonight, does this lower our chances of winning greatly? Tomorrow even if we dominate the 35% it's not gonna be enough to cover the 65% unlike the case tonight where we had an equal chance of winning. Or is this Digital Sales Chart a better criteria like does it compute the rank and not the number of sales or something? Can anyone help me out?

So maybe some of you saw that in Prologue, there is a date written on a wall as you can see [here](https://40.media.tumblr.com/d823a71a422986a00afe03aa9eb2bbf1/tumblr_inline_nx3o8huozL1tdpdiy_540.jpg) and [here](https://41.media.tumblr.com/bdc7bd8a66b1773b0e04a098d916aff0/tumblr_inline_nx3o7nV5lU1tdpdiy_540.jpg) right under Taehyung. It says 160516 (May 16th 2016). We know how Big Troll Entertainment likes to drop hints here and there in their music videos and I feel like that could be one of them? We'll see on Monday at 12AM KST.

This got me thinking though, if it's really the release date for the Save Me MV, it must be important to the HYYH storyline. Why wouldn't they have written the release date of Fire and the album (May 2nd) instead? I am hyped. What do you guys think ?",9,15

I wanted to keep tradition since the last post 4 months ago when this subreddit reached [over 1000 subscribers](https://redd.it/3zl0ig) which was an introduction post. We've gained a lot of new people to this subreddit (myself including) so let's get to know each other! 

I'll use my reddit name, I'm Endy, I'm 15 and I'm from the United States. I'm currently attending freshman year in high school which will be ending in a week. (boo final exams) I have one incredibly adorable and derpy dog, but I'm also a cat person.  I've known BTS since early November after watching [Dope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM). I remembered I was adding their music to my playlist on spotify, then one day after November 30th, a new set of songs appeared and I was totally confused, I missed the hype for their new album released The Most Beautiful Moment in Life pt. 2. My bias is BTS is [J-Hope,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xtA27BsH1g) I also have 6 bias wreckers (Jin stay in your laaaaneee). My flair, Car Door Guy is from the astonishing video of [Jin exiting out of a car.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OOWEeZF-E4). I'm also into other groups as well, EXO, Got7, Shinee, Twice, and 2ne1. Well, that's all I have about myself I guess. You can find me on this subreddit mostly, I'm usually trying to think of new discussion post so I can get some interesting threads going. I'm interested to see in what you guys will post.

As the orignal creator of the 1000 subscriber post said, 

&gt; That's about it from my side! Whether you decide to reply in this thread or not: welcome to this sub and I hope you enjoy your stay

 I did purchase the membership for the fanclub but because I am in the US  anyway so I don't think I could get the Tokyo one (and tbh I made the mistake of missing the deadline for linking it to the DAUM cafe and stuff because life was happening).

I tried using Japanconcerttickets.com but they told me that right now it's only up for grabs for members....can anyone help me? I will pay (even if it's too expensive than what I have right now, maybe i can pay half now and half later?), and even bring goodies from the US...thanks!",26,9

319,2016-5-15,2016,5,15,14,4jersc,Youtube / Twitter / Dailymotion / Masterpost Guide,oathbreakerr,1463288520,"Hi guys! Last time I posted one of these it was just for YouTube, and 4 months ago, and since Bangtan is promoting right now I thought I'd put together a little masterpost / mish mash thing of links!

*Where do I start????* Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here. Some of you reading this will be bangtan veterans and will be like 'oh, i haven't subscribed to this channel yet'. This post is for you. If, however, you are new to bangtan and have subscribed to this subreddit to find out more about the boys, this post is also for you!! If you don't know where to start with BTS, here's a checklist:

* [primer post](http://blindmouse.tumblr.com/post/140936170641/a-bts-primer)
* watch the bangtan bombs! these are on the 'bangtantv' youtube channel, but you'll find a list of them subbed in this [masterpost](http://bxngtans.tumblr.com/videos), there's also 'episodes' (basically, long bombs) in the same post!
* watch [american hustle life](http://www.dailymotion.com/ArmyBaseSubs) - it's cringey and sometimes terrible, but think of it as basic training for BTS. (and you get to watch jimin curse a 14 year old)
* YAMAN TV - a personal favourite!! This is in the same masterpost as the bombs, it's super funny and they're basically uncensored.
* Weekly Idol - not hard to find, they've done 3
* just make your way through this master post at your own leisure! i just realised i haven't put any links to rookie king in here... but it's out there.... if you've made your way through it, i applaud you, because i still haven't. 


**Music Shows**

* If you want to live stream them on a music show, follow [@kpop_stream](https://twitter.com/kpop_stream) on twitter! They'll post a link to their website (or alternatively, you could just visit the website) on the day of the music show. For example, Bangtan are performing on [Inkigayo today](http://www.k-popstream.com/2015/11/show-sbs-inkigayo.html), which starts at 3:30 KST
* Use an app like timebuddy to figure out what time that is where you live!


**Twitter**

Twitter is really great if you want to have your finger on the pulse of literally everything that's happening. Not only do all the fansites post everything on there

* The first one isn't a twitter, but I didn't know where to put it and it's important - [bangtan tumblr](https://bangtan.tumblr.com) posts and tags like, almost every photo ever. It also goes back YEARS - so if you want to trip out like I did and see them post stuff like 'we think they're debuting as a six member group!' and 'we have no idea who 'V' is, but we'll accept him either way!' go there. Also, the tagging system is YYMMDD, eg. today would be 160515
* Also not twitter! [bts instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bts.bighitofficial/) sometimes stuff gets posted here?
* [The BTS Twitter](https://twitter.com/bts_twt/) I'm just covering the bases - I'd also suggest you turn on post notifications!
* [BTS Bighit Twitter](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit) honestly like half of the tweets are about the fancafe, but what isn't about the fancafe is quality content
* [BTS_BiTS](https://twitter.com/BTS_BiTS) they post a lot of stuff about music shows etc
* [@_helloflora](https://twitter.com/_helloflora) i'd marry this girl if I could, she posts performances from music shows &amp; literally everything like 2 seconds after the performance finishes! It's all raw and in korean tho, and she posts nct u and infinite stuff every now and then, so if you can't read hangul you might just have to click every link hahaha
* [@JHOPEID](https://twitter.com/JHOPEID) for hobi fans, they literally post e v e r y t h i n g
* [@bangtanitl](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl) just a general account you should follow
* [@rinahopiekookie](https://twitter.com/rinakookie) i follow her bc she goes to tons of fansigns and posts vines!
* [@Bulletproof_SG](https://twitter.com/Bulletproof_SG) they post *a lot*
* [@bangtan_subs](https://twitter.com/BTS_Trans) they translate tweets and sub videos, you can also follow them on [tumblr](http://bts-trans.tumblr.com/) - they have pretty much every tweet starting from may 2013!!!
* [@Love_with_V](https://twitter.com/Love_with_V) Tae fans, she reposts a lot of videos and I usually find out about new subbers from her!
* [@BTS_FACTS](https://twitter.com/BTS_facts) just general info
* [@midteencrisis](https://twitter.com/midteencrisis) the lovely person writing this masterpost who cant resist a good self promo
* [@bts1306trans](https://twitter.com/bts1306trans) they often live tweet translations of v app broadcasts etc
* [@SmurfBTS](https://twitter.com/SmurfBts) posts a lot of original videos
* [@BTS0222](https://twitter.com/BTS0222) this is a personal account too tho
* [@PeachIsSoda](https://twitter.com/peachisoda) she posts a lot of translations, and translates naver articles!

tbh theres a ton of accounts I could list that translate fan accounts, post its, v app stuff etc but they also post personal stuff! People will generally RT stuff onto your timeline and you can just follow them from there!



**YouTube**

yeah boiiii we at the good stuff now - remember, if you want to get notifications for these channels you have to click the gear next to the subscribe box! Also, as a general rule videos don't get copyright infringement or w/e on dailymotion, so that's the go-to place to find blocked interviews (if that makes sense...?)

* Not YouTube specifically, but the [V APP channel](http://www.vlive.tv/channels/FE619) is just something I have to mention~
* I mentioned Hello Flora in the twitter section, I wouldn't say you have to subscribe to her on YouTube, though
* [Army Unnie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-LlxtvNMbdHPMGjeyNMLQ) a new one I found! Her subs are good!
* [Bangtan JPN Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiPNSjTu0sFVUUFfhPCdEsA) I'll skip the bighit and bangtantv channels bc they're self explanatory, but ppl forget to follow their japanese mv channel! The japanese MV's always get posted at weird times - so like, the middle of the day, or two days after the korean mv, with no lead up at all.
* [KimmyYang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUY6rH-6Nt8VW5zkla4WbZw) tbh amazing 10/10 kimmy yang for president, she also speaks chinese!! Also follow [This one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMR5_d5Sn5NXW21gBSAo1GQ) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyzEhJmuuPQlf9yI7x4eGmw) and check out her [dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/KimmyYang) for more stuff 
* BTS0613 - if you search this on youtube there's a billion channels, they post raw videos (usually music show performances) and keep being banned from youtube hahahahaha
* [Peppy Grace](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT4nNCanpHVSq19hp2wxMxg) she posts a lot, what a bae
* [Jungkookie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmb7jXF20LZ40VGxYhf0mQg) and her [second channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgclhIqZY5gKPD0ycvslUaQ/videos) - she posted that horrendous smart cf... oh my god....
* [PeachIsSoda](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkY0i2m9wWSsaFKZfJ_rRTw) - i posted her twitter link above. She posts regularly and good stuff (she subbed an asc episode THE DEDICATION. THE. DEDICATION.) but it's usually in 480p and sometimes her english isn't great.
* [Misxing You](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBIi7lztsp4o4eDGZLSijg) chinese subs
* [Bangtan Subs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5m4L0y_OJIJ2NWPRcayXvg) they don't post as fast as other channels, but like, they will eventually post it? They're pretty reliable, just not fast hahaha, they also post stuff on [dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/bangtansubs2)


List of posters you can subscribe to (I am) but dont post regularly, are on hiatus, etc

* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8z6nUSMH--Xn0TnYenQryg - used to be really active, has a lot of old videos, also check out their old dailymotion http://www.dailymotion.com/minsuga
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKvwispN7MFn6S3UK6qSkGw - they've been silent for like 2 months lmao guys come on what happened we had something here

**OTHER / MASTERPOSTS**

Some gorgeous angels have decided to put together masterposts, god bless their souls. Generally they'll do them and never, ever, ever update them, so links might fail etc - but the thought counts!! most of them still work. This list also includes old dailymotion channels that have a lot of content you might not find in other places &amp; dvd content!

* http://bxngtans.tumblr.com/videos - my go to for radio shows etc
* http://flowerchildofexcellence.tumblr.com/post/122150235475/masterlist-bts-group-variety-shows-episodes - i honestly don't know why they made the text black??? just highlight everything and you'll be able to see it hahahaha
* http://jvnghope.tumblr.com/liveperformances - music show masterlist. useful if you want to watch every war of hormone break or i need you high five (i totally didn't do that what are you talking about)
* http://hellosarang.tumblr.com/links - **AWESOME LINK** she has the entire of the hyyh dvd subbed, the jpn hyyh unsubbed, Now 3, wake up dvd, 2016 seasons greetings (i'm still convinced they were hungover when they filmed this.... i'm not the only one, right? right?) etc HELLO SARANG IS A+++ 
* http://www.dailymotion.com/doro-soro - old dailymotion channel, has a lot of stuff!!
* http://www.dailymotion.com/harlekeinn - subbed now 1 &amp; 2, summer package


**LEARNING HANGUL!!!**

It really shocked me when I found out Korean has an actual alphabet, and isn't like Chinese or Japanese where everything means something different (I have no idea how they work, I'm sorry). Korean only has 24 letters, I think, and I learn how to read it [here](http://ryanestradadotcom.tumblr.com/post/20461267965/learn-to-read-korean-in-15-minutes). I practice reading it by installing the korean keyboard on my phone and writing group member names (try seventeen... oh my god... ), or reading host names at music shows etc.

~ ~ ~ ~

This took me like, 2 hours to make. If you have any suggestions PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put them in the comments!! Really, anything. Random facts about your bias, funny shows I didn't mention, explain the entire amazing thing that is *fansites*. Seriously, go wild.

Anyway, hopefully you guys are not having withdrawals like me so let's talk about the small things the members do that get you to smile 'that' way or fondly! I'll start!

**Rapmon** - He always reads comments (mostly on FC). That's why he's always seen on his phone all the time in Bombs. Whenever I see him in the background reading/looking on his phone (he might be reading fanfics for all we know) but I found myself smiling fondly. Also, when he just lets the members play around with him.

**Jin** - His outburts lol ""Let me talk!"" or ""The camera can't see me!"" I just love him!

**Suga** - Whenever he just went .jpeg and blinks his eyes repeatedly even if he's not the focus of the camera. I find it hilarious lol

**Hobi** - I actually like his puns lol and that embarrassed stare/smile/laugh after that.

**Jimin** - When his lisp actually comes out when he speaks. Half lazy half cute.

**Tae** - Maybe not small but whenever he wears that torn and cut up shirts of his. Really 'my-way' kind of person lol

**Jungkook** - Whenever he stutters when he talks...I find it cute? 

What about you guys?.",67,46

Write anything you feel about this era in the comments!,IamNR,1463598500,"####The HYYH era started with ""The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Part 1"" and was released on April 29^th, 2015.

It dealt with Teenage Insecurities and Problems as its main Theme...

This is the first album where all of the members participated in either the production, composition, or lyric-writing of the songs. Despite the album's name expressing ""the most beautiful moment in life"", the band also wanted to express the anxieties and insecurities youth may face. In response to the studio album length of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1, Rap Monster and Suga explained that the group thinks every album as a full-length album, as the members want ""to tell a lot of good stories"".

The Songs Included:

1. Intro: 
2. I NEED U *[Title Song + MV]*
3. Hold Me Tight
4. Skit: Expectation!
5. Dope *[MV]*
6. Boyz with Fun/Heungtan-Sonyeodan
7. Converse High
8. Moving On
9. Outro: Love Is Not Over

""I NEED U"" and ""Dope"" had their own Music videos with ""I NEED U"" starting the damn theories surrounding HYYH era! 

***

####""The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Part 2"" was released on November 30^th the same year continuing the HYYH era! It was preceded by the PROLOGUE video which featured the songs ""Butterfly"" and ""Ma City"".

It dealt with Keeping yourself strong during those insecure and problem/sadness filled times during one's Youth.

According to the members: ""Part one explained how youth is tiring and difficult, and it also touched on how we feel like were always on edge. Part two will have a more adventurous and daring feel to it. Thats why our title song is 'Run'."" Rap Monster added: ""We didnt want to just blankly say cheer up or be strong. We really wanted to comfort people our way, by producing the music and writing the lyrics ourselves. We poured our heart and soul into this amazing song.""

The Songs were:

1. Intro: Never Mind
2. Run *[Title + MV]*
3. Butterfly *[Main song in Prologue]*
4. Whalien 52
5. Ma City *[Featured in Prologue]*
6. Baepsae / Silver Spoon
7. Skit: One Night in a Strange City
8. Go-yeob / Autumn Leaves
9. Outro: House of Cards

""Run"" had its own music video and continued the story line from ""I NEED U""

***

####""The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever"" was released on May 2^nd, 2016 (the next year). It is their first compilation album and also features extended plays and mixes of various songs released prior to this album.

The NEW songs were:

1. Fire *[Title + MV]*
2. Save Me *[MV]*
3. Epilogue: Young Forever *[MV]*

The MIXED songs were: 

1. Butterfly: Prologue Mix + Alternative Mix
2. I NEED U: Urban Remix + another Remix
3. Run: Ballad Mix + Alternative Mix

The FULL LENGTH EDITION songs were: 

1. House Of Cards
2. Love Is Not Over

The EXISTING songs were: 

1. Intro: 
2. I NEED U
3. Hold Me Tight
4.  Autumn Leaves
5. Run
6. Ma City
7. Baepsae / Silver Spoon
8. Dope
9. Converse High
10. Moving On
11. Whalien 52
12. Butterfly

""Fire"", ""SAVE ME"" and ""Epilogue: Young Forever"" had their own Music videos with ""Young Forever"" finishing this long and amazing era.

***

####In addition to these, BTS also had a lot of LIVE performances. Those LIVE performances also featured a lot of other mixes of their existing songs! Also shout out to those Bombs, Interviews and V-Live videos!

***

####So ... this was their HYYH era which dealt with the topic of ""YOUTH"". It covered 2 years from 2015-2016 and might be the most profound and deep topic or K-pop act ever done. 

Every member contributed something or the other to these songs. The dances were amazing and on-point too. 

This was the era which REALLY DIFFERENTIATED BTS FROM OTHER GROUPS and made them really popular. We ARMYs will never think that BTS is just another Boy Band!

***

##So... Please write your thought in the comments. What did you think of this era? How amazing was it? Where was it lacking? What would you have liked more? ... Anything!

*The excerpt from the interview...*

##... When asked if there is a special reason why the episode features boy group BTS, Lee Hwan Jin answers, BTS also has seven members, and the rewards from the challenges are to be donated for a good cause so we needed people who are youthful and energetic. As their name Bulletproof Boy Scouts suggests, they are very powerful when they perform. Moreover, we felt sorry towards Rap Monster about his first appearance on Running Man.

##He reveals that BTS was very thrilled to be on their first variety show appearance as a complete group. He says, It was cute how their ears turned red. They started with so much energy but theyre frailer than you would think, and that made them even cuter. Rap Monster, V, and Jung Kook were very active....

the lovely /u/amandapearl2 and I were bored, so we decided ranking every BTS song from our most favorite to our least favorite would be a fun weekend project! In all honesty, this ranking means next to nothing, as I legitimately like every single song BTS has ever released. For the purposes of the list, we included all songs on every album, including special albums, that aren't repeats of others. We excluded all solos, Japanese songs that aren't originals (so yes to Wake Up, I Like it Pt. 2, etc, and no to Run in Japanese, for example), and *I* personally included other group covers that had more than 2 people singing, and that were post-debut. So yes to Beautiful, no to Graduation Song (*sniffle* I love that song- for the record, it's one of my very favorites). All intros, outros, interludes, remixes, and extended editions were also included. Let me know if I forgot a song to include! Totally possible- there are way too many.

I've gotta say that it was particularly challenging to figure out where to place my favorite intros and outros. They're so much shorter than full length songs, and I used to think that they shouldn't outrank longer songs, but in the end, I just went for how each song made me feel whenever I listen to it, and I think I did it justice.

So, I ended up with 78 total songs. I would ***LOVE*** if other people took this project on as well- I love seeing how other people rate the same things I care about. Lol, one day I'll figure out why. It's also interesting to note that my taste leans heavily in favor of mellow/moody Bangtan, rather than hype/hard-hitting Bangtan. They are my very favorite when they're smooth af, I suppose.

Without further ado, here's my list!

* 1.	Dead Leaves
* 2.	Save Me
* 3.	Hold Me Tight
* 4.	Where Did You Come From?
* 5.	Just One Day
* 6.	I Like It Pt. 1

I may or may not have opened up this topic to read /u/queenbratinella 's essay about how they perceive Suga and Rapmon's relationship haha, but I'm curious as to what others think about this topic too. 

Also, other than the tension talk, any opinions or discussion about Suga and Rapmon's relationship in general is welcome! I just wanted to open up a discussion where we can overanalyze, underanalyze, agree, and disagree freely.
