0,2016-10-1,2016,10,1,10,55b8pp,Advice on which WING album to buy?,hellopandant,1475286524,"Basically what the title says! I'm having trouble narrowing down which album version to get. All 4 is not an option because of $$$ :(

I was wondering, for the ARMY that are also just getting one, which one are you getting and how did you decide?

There's speculation that some version correspond to focusing on different members. But it is all just so confusing, with some people saying I is Suga+Jimin and others saying I is J-hope+V.

My top 2 bias is Suga and J-hope so which version should I get? Would love to know your reasoning. Maybe this post will help other ARMY's who are not completely sure which one to get too!

And additionally, is there any benefit of ordering now, like in the case of YF which first print editions came with the Dope photo cards? If there really isn't any additional benefit to ordering now then later, maybe it would be wise for me to order after seeing all 4 versions online.

Thanks for any replies!

It definitely lowers the chances of success and fame than if they were to sign to a bigger company, or at least one that had a bit of a reputation with other groups in the past. What benefit would they gain from signing to a small/inexperienced company rather than a bigger/experienced one? I mean, for some of them it might have been that there were no better options, but I remember reading that at least Jungkook had gotten offers from other companies. And as for the other boys, they're all so talented that I can't imagine they couldn't have gotten signed to a ""better"" company. So why did they choose bighit, of all the options out there? (i'm not saying it was a bad choice, i just think that it gave them a big disadvantage at the start, and makes their success so much more impressive now).",46,29

(it's a recently published compilation of Tablo's personal quotes and thoughts).

[RM's Tweet](https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/782048404188766208): ""God  Blo [@blobyblo](https://twitter.com/blobyblo) sent this to me personally #BLONOTE""  

Tablo signed the book with the message written:  

""To Namjoon,  
Hope this will give you even a little bit of strength whenever you are having a difficult time""


I love seeing these kinds of interactions because it shows the boys building great relationships   
with artists outside of their group :')

It's especially heartwarming to see Joonie receiving such a meaningful gift from none other than Tablo,   
who's not only a huge senior artist, but also a member of Epik High, the hiphop group whose music basically inspired Namjoon to learn how to rap and to pursue music.


I think I got especially giddy when I saw this tweet because before discovering BTS,   
Epik High was my favourite group since I first heard their music back in 2005 &gt;.&lt; 

P.S. For those who are curious about the Epik High song that inspired Namjoon, it's called ['Fly'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-BlFYvdcF0).   
The song's great and Epik High's lyrics are always so thought-provoking so hope you guys will check it out",28,87

25,2016-10-2,2016,10,2,22,55i5lh,How do you rank Bangtan as dancers?,madbsy,1475413832,"This question was sparked by seeing so many comments about who the best dancer in Bangtan is on Youtube videos. I've seen so many debates about the dancer line in particular and who is the best. It got me thinking. I personally think that all of them are better than dancers than a lot of people (aka me...). But I love to watch dancers do their thing and have always wished I was a dancer. So here is my ranking and why!

J-Hope: Dances technically and emotionally. He nails EVERY step. I have yet to catch J-Hope slipping (I'm sure he does, no one is perfect, but in dance practices and stage performances, I have yet to see him skip a step.)

Jungkook: To me, he isn't as technical hyper technical as Hobi, but his moves are always so smooth and emotionally connected. He dances like he's breathing. Makes it look easy. He looks so relaxed to me when he dances. It's like there's a metronome inside of him that keeps him right on beat all the time.

Jimin: Chim Chim is super technical. He dances like a person who went to school for dance and has gotten very very good at technique (oh wait... he has :) ) He's soooooo good, but doesn't always seem as connected to his emotions as JH and JK. He's good with charm for sure, and hamming up the acting for us ARMY (thank da lordt), but to me charm and emotion are different. (This feels really critical of the squishy, Chim machine, but I LOVE HIM AND HIS DANCING!!!!! I could never be even a quarter of the dancer he is.)

V: I've said it before, I'll say it again. To me, V dances like a he has some african flavor in him okay. I love it. Exhibit V: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4yUlDtEchY.

Suga: BIAS ALERT. As long as he's not moving his arms too much, he's great! He and I both have long, awkward monkey arms so I understand the struggle. I could watch him pouring himself a glass of water all day honestly.... Did I mention Suga and I are birthday twins? Did I mention he was my bias?

Jin: Jin keeps up so well. He's definitely not perfect, but when you watch Bangtan as a whole ensemble, he NEVER sticks out. He's always in perfect alignment and harmony with the rest of the boys. And he tries so hard. Go mama Jin go.

Rapmon: I love Rapmon, and the reason he's last for me is because he always... skips... steps. All the time lol. You've been caught Namjoon! :)

There's my list!
What's yours and why?

EDIT: J-Hope Slippin': https://youtu.be/V1i_x2_TGE0?t=2m26s I forgot about this... I'm gonna go ahead and say it doesn't count because it wasn't exactly a step, but a transition OKAY :)",32,22

But I am curious how they look, compared to other group,  to the foreigners in general. Just a few weeks ago, when I just started to search about BTS, I read several posts in Korean saying that BTS is relatively weak in looks. At that time, I was still figuring out basic things about BTS, so I just accepted it as an info, but now that I get accustomed to BTS, I find that comment so strange. How come someone miss the beauty of these perfect looks -especially maknae line and SJ. And I saw some K-army call Tae and JK ""Face-genius"", which term refers to their naturally-born beautiful face. 
(Edit: Tae's eyes, eyebrow, nose, is unbelievably beautiful like animation for most Korean eyes, is it same to you or is it Korean standard? I am asking this because I heard somewhere that Koreans tend to like bigger eyes because we have small eyes. then, because foreigners whose natural eye size tends to be bigger, big eyes do not as much stand out as to us?
Likewise, JK's big eyes, high nose, white skin is called Jal-Saeng-BBeum, which means handsome but pretty. Is it also Korean standard or same to you?)
Even compared to the best Idol groups for last decades, I feel like their looks are stunning. --&gt; Is this a proof that I am already too much Army or is it objectively true??? What do you think? Because I feel this Reddit is a quite mature community, I hope to hear a very objective evaluation (if it is possible, you armies.. hehe)",74,27

Since I'm normally not really into boy groups I was quite unaware of BTS until 'Dope'. The first person I noticed was Jin because I really liked his facial expressions during the video!

(side note: a few visuals for that whole video were a bit of a bad first impression for me because I was convinced that Suga was an obnoxious little spoiled brat and V looked like a twelve year old + Rapmonsters hair was not so pretty for him) 

While I still consider Jin a pretty guy, I feel like he doesn't attract my eye as often since he keeps his facial expressions either neutral, flower boy or dramatic puppy in most other MV's. 
Although I think V is the prettiest looking kid now, I prefer Rapmonster's face because it feels the most sincere to me. As in it seems to me that he doesn't really overthink how his face looks when he expresses his emotions. But maybe that's just me ;)

48,2016-10-4,2016,10,4,7,55qfc6,What Happened Over Night in K-charts,btskoreanfan,1475534688,"There is a post about Melon already but I will post this separately because it is a long story. 

Last night, all music charts in Korea saw BTS songs climbing up again, even to 7th place in Melon (the most representative chart). Let me explain what happened, because K-army is calling the night one of the memorable days as army. 

BTS tends to have younger fans. They are even called Cho-tong-ryung, which means biggest star for the elementary students. Popularity among this young population is the key to the biggest idol, but it has drawbacks: K-army seems less organized than other big companies fans that have know-hows and organized fan culture. Even I can tell this because I myself have long been a  fan of a big group, and I know quite much about how they organized people and money to support, for example, an individual member. They way they do this grew very disciplined as time passed, and now the fans of my old UB group are kind of automatic in doing all the supporting work. As far as I saw, BTS fans have a lot more room to learn from them at least about fierce supporting. I guess as army gets older, they will accustomed to more supporting things, and importantly enough, they will have more money to spend for BTS as much as other groups' fans do.

One of the symtoms I saw of this fandom is that they do not stream music. Majority of these young kids really don't care about streaming and some fans have been trying to ""persuade"" them to stream and download songs of BTS. So they have been frustrated to see this so-called superstar group (k-army call them Su-s, referring to their unexpected growth to superstar status) almost falling out of top 100 chart. 

In this situation, Bangtan.com (a relatively new, but a united BTS fan webstite) assigned last night 10 )'clock as a ChongGong. Chong(total, all) Gong (attack) is a word to refer to a specific time asking all fans to collaborate to reach a goal. Last night ChongGong had a goal to check, once the new song is released,  how far we can go up. - it was kind of a fan practice to prepare the new album. It was planned because even fans in official cafe have not been all focused on streaming, so it was kinda to discipline K-army themselves. 

And then, fans were happily surprised to see Fire 30 or so around 1 AM. Then SJ posted thankyou message about the chart on fan cafe. Fans started to feel more motivated and gave up sleeping. They again 26--&gt;16--&gt;9--&gt;7. Not only Fire but also Save me, Run, etc got up on charts. Melon charts gets renew every hour on time, so they were waiting each hour to check and imagine how happy they must have been. 

Members of BTS must have seen it. SJ posted messages on fan cafe twice (I could not see it because I am not a member there yet), and V posted once at dawn. Fans say how warm and boy-friendish SJ sounds, worrying about fans not getting sleep, and Tae is thanking fan. 

So, we feel relieved.. Army can do it! With so many comebacks around 10.10, fans were worried about BTS fans not streaming, but maybe many army saw how their efforts lead to result last night. 
Some even call the day historical 1004 night. I wanted to share the story with you i-fans. :)

What did you think of this Survivor? Are you happy with the results?

As for me, my hopes were already dead because I was originally rooting for Path, which was already long gone, although I'm also satisfied with NMD's win.

This is difficult outside of Korea, but [here's a tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDUzz2p79XOkUxtHxduLZLq1etERLwwQGI96wDYuVeY/edit) for making a Melon account if you're interested.

##Other things that help too:  

* Increasing the view count on the [ibighit channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc)

* Donate to the [WINGS project](https://twitter.com/WINGS_streaming/status/781714082365779968) to help bulk download the title track!  

#Help BTS rank on Billboard!  

###Hot 100 Breakdown by % (though it varies a LOT, read more [here](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work)):  

* Sales: 35-45%
* Airplay: 30-40%
* Streaming: 20-30%

*Note*: All of the following will only work if you are in the USA, or use a VPN to be in the USA. If you do this from outside the USA, it wont count towards Billboard; it will only count towards your own countrys chart.  

To explain, airplay (which means mainstream radio airplay) is basically impossible. No point in putting energy into it; though its very possible to rank on the Hot 100 with zero airplay (you just wont rank near the top, lol. Our goal is only to get on the list tho; ranking is irrelevant).  

10 downloaded tracks = 1 album, and 1,500 plays on Spotify, Rhapsody, Tidal, Rdio, Beats, Google Play, Apple Music, Amazon Prime and others + Youtube, Vevo = 1 album.  

###What to do:   

* Buy a physical copy of WINGS if you havent already.  
* [Buy the album on iTunes digitally](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wings/id1163598716) (if you cant do that, then just buying the title track for $1.29 also helps a lot!)  
* Stream the title track on Apple Music. You can use the 3-month free trial of Apple Music if you havent already, or you can pay $9.99/month to use it. [Here's a comment explaining how to change your iTunes to be set in the USA](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56jsmh/pann_161008_wings_streaming_tutorial_other_things/d8kcays)  
* **STREAM ON SPOTIFY!!!** - Spotify is free to download/listen, youll just have to listen to ads every so often. Its best to focus on streaming just the title track. [Here's a guide](https://twitter.com/armyeonnie_/status/785988717693415425)  
* Increase Youtube views! (This is the only thing you can do from outside the US and still have it count, haha).  
* If youre able to stream (legally) on any other site like Rhapsody, Tidal, Rdio, Beats, Google Play, or Amazon Prime, do that too. Though idk if BTS will actually put their music on any of those places, lol. Lmk if they do~ EDIT: [official links for itunes, spotify, google music, and tidal as tweeted by BTS](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/786107087281614848)   

##Best way to increase views on Youtube  

I mean, you can do whatever things you want, but heres the only things I think really matter if youre going to increase views:  

* Click refresh to rewatch; do NOT click the replay button. Youtube wont count it as a view unless you refresh the whole page.  
* Play the video from start to finish.
* For some reason volume settings effect view count. Always make sure the video is up to 50% volume or above.  
* Doing this on different devices (as in, your phone, tablet, computer, apple watch, your mom's computer, smart TV, any device that can access youtube) will help a LOT! (make sure you aren't logged into the same account on all of them though)  
* Try to clear your cookies/youtube watch history every so often. [Heres how](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?hl=en). Alternatively, you can just close and re-open your incognito browser to do the same thing.

96,2016-10-7,2016,10,7,12,569ep9,Have kpop singers' comebacks been always like this?,btskoreanfan,1475810376,"This is my first time to see bts coming back with a new album. And I see this all hyped atmosphere online as if sth is gonna burst out. I wonder whether this is felt so because I am BTS trash or it really is. 

Obviously it has some objective proofs -
1) Preorder number already paid till yesterday : minimum some 110000 (only from synara)
2) preorder number from shops (not paid, so the number could be considerably reduced if the album ends up not being sold, but this could be a guage of how much shops anticipate the album will be sold): 500,000

If compared to Young Forever album, preorder from fans at that time was some 50000 (now minimum 110000 more than twice), YF first week real sales was 160000 (three times of pre ordered number, so we can guess the first week sales this time). 

The highest sales in the first week in Idol history was from Exo 500,000. (Almost 150,000 of this was from chineses fans. BTs case was only 8000 or so from China last time )
 I dont think Bts can reach there yet but they will possibly secure the second position with this album. (Currently the second record is also from Exo some 300000.)

I have never seen a group rising up as muc as twice everytime they release new album! 
 Bts record is quite amazing.
And i wonder if this strangely hyped atmosphere online is particular for bts or has been so always with other come backs including Bts former albums. If you are an oldbie, how were last times?

BTS has been deviating from their hip hop beginning for a while, but I love both Fire and Save me. For BST, I like it until the ""Mani, Mani, Mani"" came up. Then it just became jarring. And Jin didn't have a line. ): I know he had all the acting in the MV but I don't think it should be mutually exclusive. I haven't had the chance to listen to the rest of the album. I'm not keen on them trying to fit some storyline into the video though I understand that it has been very successful for HYYH. A video focusing on dance will be more suitable.

Now yesterday during my plan I was (re)watching the mess that was the VLive broadcast for the release of Wings and she LOVED their antics (who can resist?) 

She wants to see more today during our plan that is only 45 minutes long. So my question to you: which are the best videos that really showcase the members and their personalities in a short amount of time? She seems to gravitate towards Taehyung right now, but she was dying at all of them

I just want to make sure I'm showing the best BTS content that will make her love them as well!!!

242,2016-10-12,2016,10,12,6,570ep8,Bangtan is what Korea needs for a respectful expansion of Kpop,Baldtan,1476220124,"There is a previous posting about a Swiss news article on Bangtan. The author is obviously confused as to why a Kpop song that does not have funny looking people with quirky/weird/funny dancing can be so popular and managed to get on many music charts, especially the charts in Western countries and the America. He made his references to Psy's previous songs such as Gangnam Style and Gentleman, etc.  The author's view of Kpop as something that can only be popular because it is weird and funny is unfortunately representative of the Western world general opinion on Kpop/Korean Music. In their mind, Kpop is not popular because of the music quality but because it is funny.  There is already an unfortunate and untrue perception of Asian people as weird and dorky and Psy's music videos accidentally confirm their prejudices.  This is the reason why the author was so confused of BTS's popularity worldwide with their album. He even mentioned that people generally only buy the singles that they like and not the full album (so why is BTS's album doing so well?). What I want to point out is that BTS is the first Kpop group that sings in Korean (not English) and is able to be relatively successful in entering the Western music market.  This is what the Korean music industry needs for people to change their opinions and actually respect Kpop for their music quality. The reason why people would buy full albums is due to their trust in the artist's talent and their music quality. People will only buy singles from artists if they think the artist cannot be trusted to create a full album of quality music, that they will not be able to enjoy every song. Therefore, the fact that BTS's album is charting all around the world should be a huge deal to the Kpop industry (I don't get why they have not realize this yet). This may be what they are lacking and why they were not successful in entering the Western market before. I don't consider Kpop songs sung in all English (CL's Lifted) as Kpop, they are basically western songs but are sung by a Korean person (no more, no less). BTS's music model might be the key for Kpop to finally break through the Western music wall!",30,82

+) Just my opinion, but as BTS gets more attention from abroad these days, more K-armys will turn their eyes to foreign articles. I am anticipating that more K-armys might involve in translation and visit foreign sites like here. So, if you guys have a guide posted about taking articles/posts/replies outside this website, it will be helpful. But this is just my opinion.

One of the songs that stood out to me the most is Jin's song Awake, very unusual style from BTS's normal music tone and I really like it. The album is great and I love everything so I was feeling very happy....until I read the lyrics. Guys, my feelings went from 100 to -1000 in 1 minute and now I'm so emo...I have to post this! I don't know if you all read the lyrics of Awake but Jin was talking about himself and how he might never be able to ""fly"" like the other ""6 petals"". The 6 petals he's talking about are the the other members. And that all he can do now is keep walking and that all he wants is to run a little bit more! I don't know if I'm reading too much into this but if he's really feeling this way then that doesn't bode well for them as a whole group! He's feeling self doubt and depression (he didn't mention depression but I inferred from the lyrics, he's saying he couldn't sleep and staying awake) from what he viewed as his failure to match the other BTS's members' talents, popularity, and expectations.  Now I'm feeling really guilty because before listening to Awake I always felt like Jin has the least amount of talent in BTS. Now I realized that this is totally not true and he is very talented with a beautiful voice (his song is the first one I bothered to look up lyrics, so this means a lot). Gosh...I don't know what to say.  I also personally feel relatable to his lyrics because I sometimes feel a lot of self doubt and anger at my own short comings to expectations.  If you guys are making any more of those letter compilation, please make one for Jin too, I would love to send him a personal letter.  :(((

Edit: Holy shit now I'm too traumatized and scared to look up the other songs' lyrics",34,77

271,2016-10-13,2016,10,13,2,5755l1,PSA Re: ARMY Commenting on r/K-Pop,Akpheart,1476291649,"Hi. I have now been policed about my commenting on r/K-Pop twice by fellow ARMYs and I have something to say about it. The first time was when I used the word ""hater"" for only the second time in a comment section, which apparently is a no-no even though what I was saying was a fact. The second time was when I had the audacity to respond to a comment about BTS' music that I disagreed with from someone who did not appear to be a troll. This is the kind of thing one would expect to happen on a forum about music. 

This over-sensitivity about the reputation of ARMY has to stop. Taking others' criticism of the fandom to heart to the extent that you're policing other people's rational comments is taking things too far. We are all individuals who do things differently. Conflict on a forum happens and that's okay. I'm an assertive person and it has nothing to do with my ""identity"" as an ARMY. If I disagree with something that's been said, I will respond to it in certain cases where I warrant it worth doing. I do not start fights and I don't see other ARMYs doing that over there either. Criticism of BTS and their music does not receive tons of defensive responses. I ignore most of the trolling. Responding to comments you don't agree with is not ""behaving like an attack dog."" 

There are a lot of ARMYs so maybe the number of our comments is compounded because of that but it's not my problem. I don't love everyone else's commenting style (or music taste for that matter) on r/K-Pop either but I don't go around correcting them because *it isn't my business.* 

Others can continue to comment the way they see fit, as will I. Thank you for your time.

Edit: By the way, I'm certainly open to discussion on this subject and any and all subjects (which is what gets me into these situations in the first place). My word is not the final one. These are just my personal thoughts.",97,37

1) How was bts record last time and how far do you expect them to rise this time? 
2) Itunes album chart &amp; single chart record of Kpop group- anyone knows?
3) I am so amazed about no1 on album and no30 on single chart, but BigHit is not mediaplaying enough so i wonder why.

FYI]
Bts had private record of Bst (not public) and 21c girl (with fans) this dawn. It was planned at 1am but after rehearsals fans could get in only around 3 o clock. Choreo for 21c girls is so cute and lively, fans say, more than Hormon war and you are sure to be killed by it. 
* Fans have wanted JK have his eyebrows shown and his hairstyle for the stage was like that of Dope era. We got what we wanted. 
* Jm said that he was not paying attention to his bday but hobihyung kept counting time for him like, 3hrs for ur bday, 2hrs for ur bday. . How cute and kind hyung he is. 
* RM suggested making hearts with arms before leaving the stage but Suga kinda sniffed but then he was the one who made the biggest heart. 
* All of the members cared so much about fans bc it was too late. Fans say this recording was the best ever one. Today is the day we are gonna slayed bt choreo right? I cant believe BigHit had bts do this smoking sexy concept as soon as JK became an adult.",17,33

My favorite (in no particular order)

1. MAMA - The beat is just so J-Hope! This is the only solo tracks that don't make me cry as well.

2. BEGIN - Our baby maknae JK expressing his love to his hyungs is the cutest thing ever... He has grown so much I feel so proud of him T___T The hyungs did a good job raising him.

3. LIE - Chimchin killed me with them high notes. I especially love the ""Woo Woo Ah~"" part.

4. Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears - The chorus is so addictive! J-Hope and Yoongi told me to kiss them on the lips, too. Well, if you insist... ()

5. 21st Century Girls - The beat is just so dope! Especially that bass drop near the end. If I had to pick my ultimate favorite, this could be it because in the lyrics:
**Rapmon** told me that I'm worth it, deserve it, I'm perfect and I should just work it ()
**Suga** told me that I'm beautiful and I'm his (**)
**J-hope** told me to tell people who insult me that I'm his lady (`)
**JK** called me bae v(^^*)
**V** told me to live my life
**Jin** shouts out to the 20th Century girls (yay!)
**Jimin** told me to just let it go",70,41

287,2016-10-13,2016,10,13,15,578xhc,Art History 101 -- Bangtan Edition,Sassinak,1476340193,"Mmkay, errybody put on some [nice glasses,](http://imgur.com/a/vk7iI) cause we gonna learn today. So anyone who's seen Blood Sweat &amp; Tears doubtless noticed all the fine art featured throughout the mv -- assuming you weren't too [badly distracted.](http://imgur.com/a/d9egS) I'm far from the first person to do this, but I thought it would be fun to look at some of the works of art and maybe speculate about their significance.

I will try my damndest to stay away from outright theory-making in this post, but I will mention that I feel like there are three main narratives being drawn on -- Hesse's [Demian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demian) of course, as well as the Greek myth of [Icarus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus) and the biblical bookends of the expulsion of humans from Eden in Genesis, and the expulsion of fallen angels from heaven in Revelation. The painting that [captivates Jin](http://imgur.com/a/ilZu2) is Bruegel's Fall of the Rebel Angels, which definitely falls in the third category.

The next set piece has [three noteworthy works:](http://imgur.com/a/DHvOy) the ceiling fresco, the painting on the back wall, and the painting on the right wall. The ceiling is a reproduction of the Sistine Chapel which centers around a scene of biblical judgment. The second painting is Draper's Lament for Icarus, and the third one is another Bruegel work, Landscape with the Fall of Icarus. Sensing a theme? We'll get back to these. 

Next up is the statue seen in the background of [JHope's solo scenes.](http://imgur.com/a/CGQBP) It's a version of Michelangelo's Piet. I think this is a very deliberate choice because of its subject matter, a mother and son. This fits right in with the theme of JHope's short film and solo song, Mama (or [Eva](http://imgur.com/a/w8pSv) in the context of Demian). However, in JHope's version of the statue, the Jesus / son figure is partially made up of some [weird-ass unfinished polygons.](http://imgur.com/a/gHoES) If I had to guess, maybe it symbolizes how, in the context of the maternal relationship, the child is stuck as an innocent blank slate, not able to fully develop into personhood. The theme of innocence being undesirable and a hindrance to actualization is hit pretty heavily in Demian. 

Oh hey look, it's V. And he's, umm ... [under a sheet?](http://imgur.com/a/2vxKT) This imagery, in addition to being simply beautiful, is an homage to a very specific style of sculpture. Works like [Corradini's 'Modesty' and Strazza's 'Veiled Virgin'](http://imgur.com/a/F4u30) are famous for creating the illusion of figures draped in the sheerest of silk, despite being carved from solid marble. The symbolism foreshadows V's eventual [unveiling / reveal.](http://imgur.com/a/rPBni)

What else? Oh yeah, [Jungkook](http://imgur.com/a/GNWnb) OH JESUS can you NOT do that affdssfaf. Ugh. Let's [try this again.](http://imgur.com/a/bf5cI) Oh hey, it's our old friend [Lament for Icarus.](http://imgur.com/a/UWKxS) What is he eating so rudely anyway? It's [candle wax,](http://imgur.com/a/R5phw) which is what held Icarus' wings together and the melting of which led to his downfall. While we're on the topic of JK -- [here](http://imgur.com/a/XHZmo) he is doing his best falling Icarus reenactment (this time courtesy of Jacob Peter Gowy), complete with feathers.  Elsewhere, Jin hosts a [dinner party](http://imgur.com/a/3zHjo) which is giving me some serious [Last Supper](http://imgur.com/a/hwVJO) vibes. 

Upstairs, V [takes a plunge,](http://imgur.com/a/F59D5) as [V is wont to do.](http://imgur.com/a/N3SOw) The background for the jump is a closeup of the second painting seen in the drawing room -- [Landscape with the Fall of Icarus.](http://imgur.com/a/UWjm9) Let's take a minute to talk more about Icarus, with whom V is most strongly associated. At the risk of getting into tinfoil territory, I almost wonder if this myth has been lurking around in the Collective Bangtan Unconscious for quite a while now. First off, the reason why Icarus strapped on some wings in the first place was to escape a labyrinth -- you know, [a maze.](http://imgur.com/a/mKpKY) Also, after the fall, the place he crash-landed was [in the muthafuckin ocean.](http://imgur.com/a/Vq4AF) What if the reason V is constantly jumping off of shit is because [HE USED TO HAVE WINGS?!](http://imgur.com/a/Dlhze) Not that I'm theorizing or anything.

Welp, that's pretty much it! Yep! There's just this one ... little thing ... and, well, it's weird af and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.  So there are [two more statues](http://imgur.com/a/rspoB) which are given places of honor even after the other ones have been cleared away. The lady on the right is [Ops](http://imgur.com/a/A4VdO) (artist unknown), a Roman goddess of earth and wheat and stuff like that. In the context of the mv, she might be another representation of a mother figure / Eva from Demian. Dude on the left (note, the only black-colored statue we see) is Cellini's [Perseus with the Head of Medusa.](http://imgur.com/a/rGuuF) Wow, that's pretty random, right? Well, I noticed something strange while rewatching the short films for the tenth time, full screen and muted at half speed, looking for clues and symbols which is TOTALLY SOMETHING THAT NORMAL PEOPLE DO ALRIGHT? I DO IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO. Let's look at [V's graffiti](http://imgur.com/a/Jhml7) in 'Stigma.' (BTW, he's working on carving some letters - so far, he's got 'ABRA WAS.' I'm betting he was working toward 'ABRAXIS WAS HERE' before he was so rudely interrupted.) It's hard to make out the picture -- maybe a dark-colored person-ish shape with something round raised up in its hand? Luckily, we get another glimpse -- literally -- from [Hobi in 'MAMA.'](http://imgur.com/a/Mbtop) It's a weird dark snake-legged figure inside a frame holding up something circular in one hand and a whip in the other. Alright, I concede, that's pretty much nonsense. Grasping at straws here. If only it weren't for the fact that it's also the exact motif of [Jin's wallpaper.](http://imgur.com/a/XI3Tp) [WTAF.](http://imgur.com/a/DfJGK) Hmm, maybe there's something to this after all. It bears a strong (deliberate) resemblence to the Cellini sculpture, but it's totally Medusa herself, holding the shield whose reflection was the only way Perseus could safely see her in order to defeat her. Why was that necessary? Because Medusa's gaze turns people into stone. Lemme repeat that ... Medusa turns [people into stone.](http://imgur.com/a/vKGGD)

297,2016-10-13,2016,10,13,21,579w5v,I'm sad about Jin's lack of lines ....again,YANN_LIFE,1476360350," i didnt want to confirm this... but now that I've finished watching the Mcountdown show &amp; can confirm the line distribution...sigh.. this brought me down.
i don't know whats happening but he literally does not even have his own line in Am i wrong (it's shared with jungkook) it is such a shame... his lines distribution has always been on the low side in general due to his weak dancing, but this is just sad now. BIGHIT why :(

* he has 2 lines in 21st century girl ( it's not a difficult choreo ) 
* 1 line in Blood Sweat &amp; Tears (he danced so well in mcountdown so i don't understand..)
* 4 lines in 2!3! - better days 
* 2 lines in Interlude : Wings 

the only song that doesn't seem to have a huge distribution issue with Jin is Lost....it's such a shame because he sounds amazing in Awake and it's like they still don't know how to infuse his voice into existing songs... i wished they would just let him get one more line in the chorus at least.

i get that BTS is known mostly for their amazing choreography... but hes improved so much lately i thought the line distribution would too. especially when i consider what Awake is written about....now i'm just sad :(

what are you guys thoughts? ",40,58

I wish they had a season 3 soon and have Namjoon be a guest or permanent cast on it. Would be interesting to see him deduce and infer evidence. Also wouldn't mind a 7 vs 7 on running man! That 300th episode was too short  loved how they paired each member with the running man cast, think it would be hilarious to see them compete against each other.

And it was such a waste that the finals for Idol Cooking Show clashed with BTS schedule, if not Jin would have been able to compete in the finals. 

Any variety shows you like and would like to see BTS join?

Hypothetically, if we wanted to get BST as a *single* to chart here, we would have to get it into the top 100. However, if we want to get it played on Radio 1 for example (and I assume other stations like Capital) we would have to get it into the top 40.

[I done some really quick maths](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuwQNQGWIAA6mn3.jpg) with how many times we would have to have it streamed. This is per person a week and the charts get updated every week. 


Unless we can somehow get say 150 people (idk how big the UK fandom is lol there is more than 150 of us isn't there..) to stream it *literally every second of the day*, it would give a total of 4200 sales. (500 people streaming would give 14k sales....)

As I said in the image, I have no clue how many sales you need to make it into the top 40 but 4200 is a start to push it possibly into the top 100. It is currently at #145 on iTunes and #204 on Google Play.


MAYBE just maybe, we can get it into the top 40 and it can be played on the likes of BBCR1 and Capital.",14,35

It's always fun to see how the boys respond to post-it notes with questions ARMYs ask,  
so I wanted to share some that I found translations for from a recent fansign event.

A couple of days ago, as I was scrolling down the comment section of B,S&amp;T I noticed that there was a kind of competition for the Daesang award going on between BTS and another group. 

As I slowly found out about this incident in my country' kpop pages, I was quite shocked at the controversy surrounding Rapmon's statement that BTS were trying to achieve this award. I mean, I couldn't imagine the sheer intensity of vicious comments and posts downgrading the group that I had just begun following and loved (hope that this would only happen in my country' s kpop communities) just because they courageously stated their dream. The effects afterward were quite horrible: I felt first confused, and then offended (by some comments made by antis) and finally, strangely depressed. I really love BTS, and when witnessing all the ridiculous hate they've received, that somehow makes me want to do everything to make their dream become a reality.

I have searched for info on this award. But somehow, all the posts on our domestic fanpages just confused me. 
Like what are the criteria for this award that we could best improve? 
Which song is International ARMY focusing all efforts in streaming ? Are there some kind of project going on so that I could join in ? 
And finally, what is thel probability for BTS to win this year's award ? 

I know that there are probably one or two other really powerful groups with larger fan base which are competing for this award. But still, I want to keep trying so that I would not regret once looking back at this era. 
Thank you.

394,2016-10-17,2016,10,17,8,57uby8,A friendly reminder about submission guidelines,dorkprincess,1476661068,"Hello all, seeing as how the sub has grown a LOT since the last time we talked about rules ([like....seriously a lot](http://i.imgur.com/XjCwnHF.png)), I just wanted to encourage you all to familiarize yourself with the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) again. I'm going to go over a few of the rules I think need to be emphasized a bit more in this post, but be sure to familiarize yourself with the other rules in there. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/3yof75/rbangtan_rule_update_151229/) is the post with detailed explanations for why we decided to have most of these rules in place :)  

#1. Submission Flairs  

I think some people might not know how to add flair to their submissions, so I'd like to remind you all of the [guide I made for how to flair submissions](http://imgur.com/V59YJry) in the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq).  

Generally for live performances add the ""Live"" flair, and I recently added a ""Netizen"" flair for translated Pann posts from sites like Peachisoda :) If you think there should be a flair here that's missing, let me know below! I've been thinking about adding a ""fancam"" flair recently.    

#2. Submission Titles  

I've noticed that people have been submitting links with titles that don't really describe what the video/picture is. Please read the [submission title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_submitting) to get an idea of what kind of information you should include in the title.  

To give an example, If I wanted to submit [this](http://i.imgur.com/XvIybmx.jpg) adorable picture of Jin, here are the types titles I could give it:  

a. The cutest little bunny  
b. The cutest little bunny @ Mokdong fansign 161016  
c. Bunny Jin at 161016 Mokdong fansign  
d. 161016 Jin @Mokdong fansign  

a. is not an acceptable title. It gives no information about what the link is for/about. b. is slightly better; though still not totally acceptable because it doesn't say which member it's a picture of. Both c. and d are 100% acceptable though :) If you absolutely *cannot* find the date or place the picture was taken, you can leave it out. However it's strongly encouraged that you add it if possible, in case people want to find more pictures from that date, or to see how old it is etc.  

Let's do another example, this time with videos. Let's say I wanted to submit [this](https://vine.co/v/5H1w6JaqL55) video. A+ content, right? Let's make sure we communicate exactly how ***amazing*** this piece of content is to the rest of the sub. Again, here are some titles I could use:   

a. My love, my sun and stars, too precious for this world  
b. 161016 look at this ADORABLE man    

c. 161016 Cute bunny Jin at Mokdong fansign!!    
d. My love, my sun and stars, too precious for this world (161016 Jin@ Mokdong fansign)   

a, while 100% accurate for me, personally, is not a descriptive enough title for this submission. b, again, is better, but including the member the video is about in the title is necessary. c is pefect. d is also acceptable (as all the info needed is included in the title, just at the end). I personally would find that title cringe-y and wouldn't use it, but hey, I wouldn't remove it.   

Now let's do an example with a video that's less fluff, and more like an interview of some sort. [For this video](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4wxx1w_eng-161010-ytn-news21-bts-comeback-sweeping-away-world-music-charts_news) it would be best to just copy/paste the title of the original video ([ENG] 161010 YTN News21 BTS Comeback Sweeping Away World Music Charts) into the title, since all the relevant information is there already. For something like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhHcgbFN_rg&amp;feature=youtu.be), which doesn't contain all the information in the title, putting the date the video was posted (for interviews) or the date it happened (for performances) is the best idea. So for that bomb, I would title it like this: ""[BANGTAN BOMB] 161012 '  ' MV Reaction by BTS"".

#3. Reposts  

I have noticed that people are submitting a lot of links that have already been posted and/or are already a part of a bigger compilation thread. Please use the search function before posting something, and try to make sure no one has posted a compilation thread with that separate video included in it already. Most music shows will have their own compilation thread with all of the cuts included in it, so I'm going to start removing separate submissions of music show performances (this way all the discussion is all kept in one place as well).  

#4. *NEW*- Eng Sub vs Raw  

Some of us mods have been thinking about adding a rule that once a video has English subtitles available, someone can post it in the comments of the raw video rather than giving it its own separate submission. This is because subtitles come out so quickly now, and making separate posts just tends to split discussion and add more clutter to the sub. When someone has added a link to eng subs in the comments, the person who adds the link in the comments should tag either (or both) the OP or the mods so they can change the flair from ""Raw"" to ""Eng Sub available"". We haven't decided definitively either way yet, but I thought it'd be a good idea to ask all of you what you think about this before implementing it.  

#5. Fancafe content  

We don't allow fancafe content here, since part of the rules of the fancafe are that things inside it are not allowed to be posted outside. We do, however, have a provision that if the post has to do with a member's health or some other serious condition/circumstance (for example, when [Yoongi posted his whole explanation after the Kobe concert debacle last year](http://letmesuga.tumblr.com/post/137013603355/160110-bts-fancafe-update)), then that is allowed to be posted.   

#6. Weekly /r/bangtan Room  

If you all didn't see it, we've started a [weekly ""talk about whatever you want"" thread called /r/bangtan room!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/57n94v/weekly_rbangtan_room_%EB%B0%A9%ED%83%84%EB%B0%A9_october_15_2016/)! (The title comes from the members' group chat on KKT called """" (BangtanBang = Bangtan room)). These threads will be posted weekly, a few hours after midnight KST on Sunday (this would be around 2pm Saturday EST if I did the conversion correctly). Because of this, threads about topics that would be better suited there will be removed from now on. By this I mean, threads such as ""OMG have you noticed how handsome Jin is lately?"" (yes I have btw :')), or other generally small observations/fangirl/boying about the members/BTS that wouldn't generate much discussion on its own will also be removed, as they are better suited to be brought up in that weekly thread.   

also, personal preference, pls try not to submit allkpop links, because that site is ... reprehensible at best.

#***~IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO ASK ME BELOW!!~***  

also jsyk I won't penalize any of the posts that broke these guidelines before I posted this, but I will start doing it after this.  

ALSO, please report any posts that break these rules!! When you report the post, be sure to say exactly what rule it broke, it helps me out a lot~ Reports are free to do and are insanely helpful!!

have a good day, and [keep being amazing~](http://67.media.tumblr.com/3857456597352b5cc1a691aa36548587/tumblr_of32rhT1cP1ui4a49o1_540.gif)

I saw a similar idea expressed in another article about BTS's new popularity. Given that BTS is the only group I follow, and that I was not into K-pop when Gangnam Style and PSY's other popular songs were around, am I the only one that feels uneasy with these comparisons? I'm glad that BTS's popularity is getting recognized more and more --- and I know PSY was insanely popular --- but, at least from where I'm from in the US, not many people think of PSY as a serious artist. The trend became huge, but I feel that, like most internet trends, it's because they found it funny or amusing. I guess I don't want people to view Bangtan like that, since I really think that they have matured in this album and displayed their growth as artists (hence the album title). Anyways, I'm probably griping on minor details, but I just hope people can appreciate BTS for their own work and PSY and his major accomplishments. ",20,18

* Yes? Really tho? ^(tsk) Stop lying.

* No? ^(sobs too) That's what I thought.

Anyhooo~~ As some of you may know, a few months back ~~literally like 2 ago~~ we finished [the letter compilation project for our gummy-smile, Kumamon-loving, tsundere boss](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/4yeg59/guidelines_for_letter_compilation_project_we_will/). This was my (and some of the other coordinators too) first-ever Kpop project and I (we) enjoyed the experience and your support very much!! You can read about the closing [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/585nts/letter_compilation_project_we_will_be_in_full/) if you haven't already.

So, since the letter compilation project was finished, I started to think... *hey, this was fun, maybe we can do more projects as a subreddit!!* If you guys would be interested, of course!

Some of the project ideas I had in mind were:

* Sending gifts for the boys on their birthdays. I don't think/expect we should send expensive gifts to the boys...rather something personal or useful. But any ideas are welcomed!! Thanks to u/Baldtan for [the idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/54zf7p/bangtan_birthday_gifts/)

* Sending congratulatory wreaths/gifts for when the boys do individual activities. For example V, this would be his first drama and I think it would be nice to congratulate him/and the others when something new/big happens to them.

* Thanking the coordinators/managers at BH for all their hard work in making our boys literally glow and keep rising to new heights everyday. I honestly think we should send a massage chair to BH, hehe.

So, this is still a very beta idea and I would love to hear from you guys!! Any questions let me know and I'll be happy to answer them!!

Love y'all and [SURVIVE](http://i.imgur.com/WDF4gwA.gif)!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**EDIT WITH MORE INFO:**

So, I guess I should have expected the response, but thank you guys for the positive feedback!! Seeing as you guys would like to do more projects as a subreddit, I guess I should explain my original plan a little bit more.

From your comments I've been given many more good ideas. Many of them are geared towards community service or donations, which is great! Now, the problem would be choosing which event to do for which project. Would you guys mind doing a poll for me to get an idea? u/Lost-In-Kpop-World suggested we do so to decide what you guys would like to do for each event/ptoject and to better organize ourselves. 

* I thought that to make it easier and less burdensome for the future volunteering coordinators, we should have a ""team"" for each member. For some of us juggling work and school is already tough enough, so adding 2^+ more projects would be too much. So as to spread the work out, I was thinking *hey let's make teams!* However, u/euendo pointed out that we might be too few to spread out to individual members...so I'm still debating on whether or not setting up teams/groups to coordinate for one specific member/project. Let me know what you guys think and/or if you would be willing to be one of the coordinators.

* The original time frame I had in mind with regards to doing these projects was in this following year, year and a half, two years maybe. Some of the projects I had in mind are pretty ambitious, to say the least, so they require time to plan thoroughly and organize. Here is a very vague timeline:

**V's drama**

 --&gt; [Airs](http://asianwiki.com/Hwarang:_The_Beginning) December 19 and the last episode would be February 21 ^(granted I did the math correctly)

--&gt; [rice wreath for press conference](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5820a4/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_doing_more/d8wv08w). The date for the press conference is not set yet, but [that will be the day](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5820a4/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_doing_more/d8wygev) we send the rice wreaths.

Yall are probably still recovering from the hit the album was (I sure still do) and nothing makes me happier than reading about the boys newly achieved accomplishments, but I have to break the chain of album related posts: Our little letter compilation already arrived (or soon will) to BigHit! 
We cant thank you all enough for your support and participation in this project. 
We received 32 (!!) letters from all over the world - and I mean this literally, we have letters from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, England, Netherlands, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain and USA.

* About the book: [Heres an unboxing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sg9ZKmxbBY&amp;feature=youtu.be)
The booklet has 56 pages, is 810 in/2126 cm, softcover. 
Because of the name (We will be in full bloom (   )) we decided to go with a lotus flower theme. The lotus flower grows from muddy bottoms to rise above the water and bloom, so we found it quite fitting. (also its one of the prettiest flowers imo haha) 
Theres a lotus flower bud on the front cover and a blooming lotus on the back as you can see [here](http://imgur.com/XRNhiEg). Also, on every right page in the corner theres a small lotus flower which blooms as the book goes, creating a flip book effect. (you can see that in the video around 2:11)
Besides that we went for a more clean look, trying to keep it as simple as possible so the focus is on your letters. 
You can see the preface letter and Yoongi snoo we made [here](http://imgur.com/hIU2Bbd)

* The gift: We decided to order 5 bath bombs from Lush. I think we all agree that the boys deserve some rest and Yoongs mentioned before he likes bath bombs so thats why that. (We even researched which scents he might like the most to make sure hell like our gift haha.)

* Also! As we all enjoyed doing this project, we discussed doing more fan project as a subreddit. u/leonoraMTY made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5820a4/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_doing_more/) about it, so make sure to check it out if youre interested!

We hope yall and Yoongi of course like how the project turned out. Thank you all one more time and an especially big thank you to all of our lovely coordinators, that is:

#vote for the song you like the least.
Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

The competition between *We On* and *Coffee* was fierce - both songs were constantly exchanging places, but in the end, **Coffee** was the eliminated one with 42% of the votes, while *We On* barely survived for another round with 40%. And as always, *  (Attack on Bangtan/The Rise of Bangtan)* and * (Satoori Rap)* are still going strong, although nothing's decided yet... Which song do you think is going out this time?

A couple of days ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/57uby8/a_friendly_reminder_about_submission_guidelines/) (please read if you haven't already), as a refresher on the sub's [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules). I also asked how everyone would feel about adding a rule where subbed videos would be put in the comments of the raw video, rather than having a separate post (the logic behind this rule is explained in the linked post). Everyone who responded to the post was in favor of implementing that rule, and us mods are also all in favor of it. So without further ado, we have added the following rule to the subreddit rules:  

&gt;Please put videos with English subtitles in the comments of the raw (unsubbed) video. Tag either the OP of the thread or a mod (like this: /u/dorkprincess) in your comment so that one of us can update the flair of the post to say ""Eng sub in comments"". If the raw version of that video hasn't been submitted (or it has been more than 24 hours* since the raw video was submitted), the English subtitled video can have its own submission.  

The mods you can tag in your comment to update the post's flair are: 

/u/bananas21, /u/h_yeri, /u/beepingsheep, and /u/dorkprincess (+whoever the OP is). To tag someone, all you have to do is type /u/ and then type their username after it with no spaces, as I did above.  

I also added the ""Eng sub in comments"" flair for you to use when needed :)

[Have a wonderful day~](http://67.media.tumblr.com/136f83a322c5000428338753d134745d/tumblr_of5du2DIwc1twwfjlo3_250.gif)  

\*this *might* be changed to a shorter or longer period of time depending on how things go. Us mods will discuss it more, but for now 24 hours is the guideline.",4,45

I'm still riding high on all of the recent success and recognition that our boys have been receiving and to celebrate I went back to rewatch some of my favorite fanvids with a few of my friends.  They filled me such wonderful, squishy feelings being able to look back at how much BTS has grown, I felt compelled to share and wanted to see if anybody else has any other vid-makers or vine-ers or fan artists that they'd like to support by repping.   (I made sure to re-read the rules and I'm pretty sure this kind of a post is okay -- just as long as nobody starts linking 17+ rated content, I think we should be golden!)

My fave BTS fanvids are by a YT user named MurdererVampire.  A kind of intimidating name, I know, but some of their videos seem to capture just all of the joy and growth and hard work that's gone into the success that BTS is reaping now.  Please check them out and share your own!

494,2016-10-20,2016,10,20,21,58gnb9,(Discussion) I am so proud of BTS.,madbsy,1476967840,"I was really thinking about it today. I have a full time job and things to do, but I find myself adding supporting these 7 guys I've never met to my to-do list for the day. I've started to ask myself why the heck do I care so much? I've never met them, I've only ever seen them perform once at KCON from a distance. They don't my face or my name, but still, I feel so proud of them.

Bangtan kinda came into the KPop industry as the underdogs. They're from a small, almost completely unknown company, they don't all fit into the current Korean standard of attractiveness (well we find them super hot, because they are, anyway),  and their sound/message is so different than most other groups in KPop. They came in around a time where everyone was doing the ""Hip Hop thing"" and were cast aside by most as just another rookie group destined to be the same as all the others.

But all the while, they were building their ARMY. Connecting with us, bringing us into their world. They were unafraid to show the most vulnerable, crazy, dorky sides of themselves. I think it was Jimin that said it best, their charm is their realness with the fans and with each other (was that Jimin who said it?) 

I think we relate to Bangtan because we ARE Bangtan. Some of us are the sometimes awkward but passionate teenager; some are very introverted, with a painful past but have the one passion that makes them get out of bed everyday; some are the one who takes care of their friends; some are extremely weird and okay with it; some are the leader type with a thoughtful/insightful side and a crazy out of this world side; some are the friend that everyone wants around to make them feel better; some have the power positive and sunshiny and make everyone feel the same way even when they don't feel it within themselves. Because we see ourselves in them, we feel connected with them and feel their success with them.

All of the records being smashed to bits and pieces. Everyday a new record. Living in Korea for the past few months, it seems like Bangtan was still not well known here. Suddenly, promptly after the drop of WINGS, Bangtan is EVERYWHERE. Stores blaring they new songs on every corner, bootleg t-shirt and merchandise store stocking up like crazy. A Korean friend of mine who don't take notice of Bangtan until this album dropped said this at dinner last night: ""Oh now I see why people love them so much. I thought it was just because of their looks like every other group, but they are actually so talented. I've never seen anything in Korean Music like them!""

Korea's taking notice, the world is taking notice. Bangtan is SOARING (pun intended). 

Who could have imagined that the ""Hip Hop try hard"" little rookie group from some unknown label would become something this big. I'm a proud ARMY every comeback, but especially this one. Bangtan and ARMYs !!!!",25,131

Make sure you are streaming not only BST but WINGS too on Apple Music and Spotify! Also if you can buying it on iTunes and Google Play.

[I made a post here addressing the project and there are links in the comments to a playlist for streaming BST on both Apple Music and Spotify.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5833sg/btsukchartsstream_project/)



&gt; **Current placements:**


*Blood Sweat &amp; Tears*

*WINGS*

Are there any BTS songs in this album or others that fit this category?


Also, since we're on the topic, are there any songs that you initially fell in love with and now another one has taken over the spot in your heart?

For me, it actually happened during this comeback. I was (don't kill me) meh about Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears on the first listen because of how different it was in feel from the video so I felt like it didn't match well. I actually loved Begin a lot more on the first listen. However, I realized BST is the title song for a reason as I listened to the full album for a week, and now it's the first song I play when I commute to work every morning instead of Begin like it initially was. Not to say I don't still love the rest of the songs on the album of course (Lost is currently my jam)!

However, for a Korean act this is a huge accomplishment. Why is BTS so successful with western/international fans? Korean media has been saying that BTS is popular in the west because their music style is very westernized. I disagree, there are a lot of other Kpop groups that are also producing HipHop/western styled songs. Some examples are iKon, Winner, BAP, Got7 etc. BTS isn't the first to make this style of music either, BigBang has been producing even more westernized sounding music like Bang Bang Bang etc. I have been thinking for a while and couldn't really come up with an answer. What do you all think?

Edit: Thank you all for the serious answers. I really love Bangtan and my love/respect for this group even baffled me because I have been following Kpop since 2008, but was never a fan of any group before BTS. What I am feeling for this group is a whole new experience for me :) ",41,44

Neither WINGS nor Blood Sweat &amp; Tears are in our Official Charts anymore, not under any of the previous albums charts or singles charts unfortunately.


We tried :( but still, getting WINGS into the top 100 album charts and them being the first Korean artist to do so is an amazing achievement!

Quick wrap-up of atmosphere in Korea. 


1) Numerous News Report on Worldwide Success esp. Billboard

From Tuesday when Billboard rank was released until today on, national/major/cable news programs featured BTS for its worldwide success. Because cable news tend to repeat the news whole day, and restaurants tend to take those channels, BTS gets a lot of chances of exposure. This is why I was waiting for billboard success! It does help a lot to let people here recognize more about BTS. 

2) Public Recognition? Better but still Long Way to Go

B/c of news, even my parents know BTS now, and male centered sites talk A LOT about BTS. Their name is a lot more known than before, and those who are exposed to the news recognize them as intl superstar.  But the wing album is more famous for being famous worldwide and for popular among the youth than for its public popularity yet. Some come to like it after listening to it out of curiousity, and I find quite q few people(even male adult) fall for BTS and recognize their dance, song and talent. Their talent is quite recognized, I reckoned. BS &amp;T will not make BTS a household name, though. As some articles already mentioned, BTS still needs viral big hit song, just one. People seem to be ready to accept them as a intl star, but the blow should come from BTS. I am crossing my fingers for their next album.

3) Still happy with what BTS got with this album

Now you hear BS &amp; T a lot on the street. In the gym where I exercised for the last year, I never heard BTS song, but these two weeks they kept playing almost whole album along with other Melon chart songs. Anti's activity is a lot less than last year, about which maybe fandom growth helped, too. A lot of other fandom are impressed with BTS this time, and many are saying 'I am newbie""~.


 4) Don't Know Why They Don't Promote More Aggressively 

I love their music and dance, and I am fine with whatever they do, but I am just curious why they don't go on the TV shows to become familiar with Korean public. They appeared only two radios, and none for TV shows other than music shows. 

Can't think more, I will update if something more pops up in mind. Ask me questions if there is any. ",24,76

550,2016-10-23,2016,10,23,4,58uow2,Rappers like J-Hope in kpop/k hip-hop?,smileyman,1477163714,"Like the title says, are there any other rappers in kpop/hip hop who sound like J Hope? I'm not saying here that J-Hope is the best rapper in kpop (even though he's my ultimate bias that would be just plain stupid), but I do think that his rapping style is very different and very unique and I'd like to listen to more rap that sounds like what he does.

For me, these are the characteristics of J-Hope's style:

1.) Tone of voice. His voice has this piercing quality that just cuts through everything. Most of the time it sounds really sarcastic (I'm thinking in particular of Cypher pt 3), but even when he's not being sarcastic the tone is a bit unusual.

2.) Speed. All rappers vary their speed. I find J-Hope to be unique in that he'll vary speed mid-word and draw out the last half of a word or speed it up. Other rappers do this too, but it's not as common as just changing speed mid sentence or mid verse.

3.) Pitch. Some rappers also change pitch when they rap, though I think this is even rarer. By pitch I mean the way he elevates or lowers the tone of his voice (not just the volume, but the tone). A good example of this is in ""Boy Meets Evil"" at about the 1:10 mark. Here he not only changes the speed of the rap mid word but also the pitch. 

I think that Zico does some of the pitch thing. It's pretty obvious in ""I Am You, You Are Me"", but that song is more sung rap than pure rap. Bewhy does some of tempo thing (I think the way Bewhy does his flow is pretty amazing and far more interesting than someone who just spits hard for 2 1/2 or 3 minutes). 

So, is there anybody else out there who has all the elements of J-Hope's rap style? Or does he just have a unique voice? Or do y'all disagree with me?",12,28

Are you happy with the results? As for me, I'm totally satisfied, Attack on Bangtan is my favourite of this album :)


**Notice about the Skool Luv Affair survivor round:** as you all probably know, SLA has a repackage version with two extra songs, *Miss Right* and * (I Like It) (Slow Jam Remix)*. We previously decided that repeated songs should only be included with the original album they first appeared in, and that remixes and alternative versions of songs shouldn't be included, therefore **the next round will combine the SLA and SLA Repackage albums to include both of their songs** ^\(basically, ^(the original SLA songs plus Miss Right)^\) or else the SLA Repackage survivor would only have one eligible song and that would automatically make it the winner.

562,2016-10-23,2016,10,23,15,58xg89,[DISCUSSION] 'Two! Three! (Still Wishing There Will Be Better Days)' Fan Song Feels,mellocchi,1477204400,"So I was just about to reply to a seoulbeats review on Wings where they said that:
""Its a song meant for ARMYs, so it may not appeal to everyone, not even their own fans. That doesnt make it bad; it just makes it another fan appreciation song. For the record, I still prefer Attack of Bangtan because it brings more hype in concert."" (This [review](http://seoulbeats.com/2016/10/bts-proves-the-sky-isnt-the-limit-with-wings/) has been linked on the sub before)


And I wanted to share what I thought about this song and why I believe it's more meaningful to ARMY and Bangtan than simply fan appreciation:
""For the fan song, it's true that it may not appeal to everyone, even their own fans, but the content and style of the song really hit home for the hearts of many ARMY. It's not really right to say things like 'true ARMY' and whatever people say nowadays when trying to point out the so-called 'fake ARMY' who either sabotage, or show their love in unconventional ways. However, for those who feel affected by the negativity directed towards Bangtan, and have worked hard to defend the image of BTS and ARMY, this song means much more.
Rather than simply a fan appreciation, it's Bangtan comforting ARMY. We all have our hardships, Bangtan-related or just within our own lives. By addressing this, and telling us that they can't fix it, and they can't lie to us, but let's hope it gets better, there's something whimsical and personal. They understand that just saying ""It'll be okay"", doesn't make it better. With lyrics that ask us to to trust in them, ""If you believe in what I say, one two three and forget. Forget all the sad memories, hold my hand and laugh"", there is something that pulls at our emotions. Those who have felt hardships together with Bangtan can feel them holding our hands and comforting us. Let's forget the bad memories together. It doesn't matter what others say about us. As long as we are together, we can get through this, so let's believe in Bangtan, and ""Lets hope that there are many more better days"".
As for how this song would be in concert, it will probably lead to many tears. Maybe it's not the hype that Attack of Bangtan would bring, but the personal connection with the fans would be stronger than ever.""


This song made me cry when I heard it (while reading lyrics), and the feels were further reinforced when watching the [MigoTV reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vLgKYhAnJA) and Migo wrote that ""I think all ARMYs who really love BTS will relate to these lyrics and know their meaning... and understand what BTS is trying to say to us ARMYs..."".

I've been with Bangtan for a year now, just before HYYH Pt 2 came out, and I've been on many social media platforms since. The amount of hate and just... ridiculous things that people say about BTS, often a result of ARMY's behaviour, can really affect those who whole-heartedly support them, and has brought me down many times from exposure to the negativity. This subreddit has been the most interesting and mature, with intriguing discussion that extend further than simple expressions of love for Bangtan, and I'm thankful to have found a safe haven. Even though it was my friends who introduced me to BTS, and I was initially (very) reluctant to call myself ARMY, I'm now proud because no matter what state the fandom is in, I know we all work towards supporting Bangtan in their endeavours, regardless of how we express it. My friends have moved to other groups, but my love stays strong, and their new album, especially the fan song, has moved my heart.

Lets get rid of the stereotypes. Its not all about dance crazes or comedic slapstick music videos. Lets tell the world that K-Pop music encompasses different facets of entertainment and music that appeal to Western sensibilities. Let's get more people to know about BTS. They are one of the many acts in South Korea who touches people through their music based on awareness of socials issues from calling for justice in the education system, speaking about their own personal struggles with mental illnesses, advocating for women empowerment, expressing everyday frustrations that many teens and young adults face, and so on. Therefore, making BST available on the radio will help both shatter those false impressions as well as help our beloved artists receive the right recognition they deserve.*

Though honestly I'd gladly accept a full version of the choreography for Rollin' which they done in the video because it was simply brilliant lol

What does this have to do with BTS? Well, this young man was recently exposed to kpop and mainly BTS by us (his subs and donators). Long story short, he's now a full-fledged ARMY. 

Anyway, I'm telling you this, because today he did something incredibly cool and unexpected. He posted a yt vid asking his subs/followers to help BTS - Dope hit 100 mill views! [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNsuPn15q9w).

I'm new here btw! I just created this acc a few weeks ago but haven't commented much, I'm from Venezuela. I've been a fan of BTS since their debut and they're the only group I stan now (I basically live for them ;;)",418,58

(I've talk this with my fellow friend and he is a volunteer for ANKLA which is an org for protection and welfare sheez of Philippine eagles). Also, Bighit anniv is 4 months away (february 1, 2005) and it would be their 12th year anniv. And since they have only 30 and below staff how about we gave them a plaque. Like we write their plaque of recognition or something.

But if you guys have another suggestion everything is welcome.
Lets have this project for Bighit.",2,30

I can't believe it's been well over a year since becoming their fan (I'm still so jealous of fans who've been with them since debut!), and I feel like every single day I'm engaged in the fandom in some way. There was definitely a time where I listened to their music around the clock, and that was the first few months after I discovered them, but that has certainly slowed down somewhat. And of course I follow them on Twitter and see their near daily selcas and words of appreciation to ARMYs. 


However, there are other ways I'm engaged as well. Like...all of my passwords are now Bangtan-related, including my work passwords, lol. It's the only thing I can remember, don't judge me! The most hilarious one is ILoveNamjoon or ILoveJoonie, because how in the world am I ever going to forget that??? Hahaha. Also there's Bangbangtan and a *very* embarrassing Namjoonswife77, lol. I changed that one, okay?! *still hides in shame*


I'm also in a couple of *ridiculously* active Kakao chats with friends that I've made from kpop facebook groups, and all we do is share a ton of pictures and squeal over the cuteness that is these 7 lovely guys. All of my most treasured gifs come from those chats and I find myself texting non-kpop fans these memes and gifs instead of actual words, and of course they just *love* it, lol.


Anyway, how do you find that Bangtan sneaks up on you in your day-to-day? Let me know!",164,34

I cried about 4 separate times while reading it. The first thing I thought -- after I calmed down enough -- was, *this needs to be shared* immediately followed by *what the hell, reccing fics on r/bangtan? no. NO.**

But I couldn't stop thinking about it all day. So, as silly as the plot may sound, I do believe it's worth reading; it is incredibly emotional and beautifully written. Please give it a chance!

The male and female artist with the highest votes would have their name displayed at the top banner. 

There was one day where the IGOT7s decided to save up their daily roses, and on that day we all gave our roses to GOT7 and it was the best feeling ever, to see us surging over EXO's roses just for one day. (For Best New Artist, the voting was neck and neck with Winner, and they won, but it was fun to support them during that time. )

They have the 'shower' again this year but with stars, and well I am an ARMY now...

Can we organize star shower dates so that ARMYs can see 'BTS' written at the top at least once or twice? Otherwise, EXO will lead every single day. Anyone know if we have a schedule for this? ",6,49

Lack of variety during this comeback? It seems that some i-fans are suspicious whether BTS is blocked? No one knows for sure, but K-fans (as far as I know) seem not worrying about it. Yeah, they were only on music stages whose view rate is normally so low. For more public exposure, we have hoped their appearance on popular shows, but they didn't. We don't know why, but it doesn't seem that there is any blocking or sabotage issue at all. Today's Ingigayo &amp; yesterday's music center, they had two stages, which is special treat. (usually singers can get more than one song only on the comeback week.) Overall, I feel that broadcasting stations are very much aware of BTS popularity. News programs have put BTS on spotlighted so much! 

I don't worry about Weekly Idol, either. It is a cable show, which most people do not watch. If BTS has appeared on them, that would have been great for fan's pleasure, but it hardly affect public. Anyway, BTS has been quite successful without the help of those shows, so we do not worry too much about it. Moreover, I read somewhere that PD Bang doesn't want BTS to be monkeys on air, so he might wait until BTS will be treated with honor?? I guess he wants BTS to be treated about music, not being funny? I don't know..  

( And this round of comeback has affected a lot of male population, I believe. Because Twice and I.O.I came back , many male fans have paid attention about charts and music shows, and they found BTS so popular, got interested, listened to music, saw the dance practices, etc, then, you know what would happen. On the big male-centered website I frequent, there are so many posts about BTS that some grudgingly said, BTS is this site's son.)

Now, K-fans are endlessly talking about votes. BTS fans tend to be young, many of them just became an army, and many are from the west.  Exo fans are a bit more mature (b/c the group debuted earlier), which means more experience in voting system and has more money to spend. And many of them are from CHINA, the land of big population and they are really determined and loyal to their group. (My former bias group had so many fans from China, and I sometimes felt scared and awed at the same time about their loyal and consistent voting). Most of them already know how to make endless accounts to vote from experience, but Army's case, I saw some K-fans teaching young fans step by step and almost crying from endless work. But this is the case when other groups were young, too. So... maybe inevitable?... 

One more trivial but proud thing about BTS. Yesterday they had ""am I wrong"" stage, right? Its timing and its lyrics were absolutely perfect, because these days Korean politics is going on one weirdest point.- the current president was revealed to have been a puppet of a religious woman, and I feel like the whole country is falling into pieces from shock, and then BTS lyric ""am I wrong"" just describe so well about our emotion. I am guessing that is why they had the stage yesterday? Not many Idol groups can make this kind of stages criticizing the current issue!! I am very impressed.",61,86
721,2016-10-30,2016,10,30,16,5a52gh,In-depth translation and meaning of Am I Wrong (includes other BTS songs by Muish),hellowred,1477813195,"[Am I Wrong](https://muish.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/bts-am-i-wrong-english-translation-and-ramblings/) -it's her latest post and it seem's like this song is gaining some buzz on pann/sites because it's kind off related to  the recent scandal (corruption) about the Korean Government

For those who haven't read it yet, you'll also find more of her translations and analysis on her blog and here are some:

[Cypher pt.4](https://muish.wordpress.com/2016/10/15/bts-cypher-4-english-translation-and-ramblings/) -one of her latest posts and a song that came from their latest album

[Ma City](https://muish.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/bts-ma-city-english-translation-ramblings/) -about the members being proud of the provinces and cities they came from, *Korea should use this for their tourism ads lol.* This is the [live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb-H3DdXNUA) also with sub (this is highly recommended for the new ARMYs)

[Spine Breaker](https://muish.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/bts-spine-breaker-english-translation-ramblings/) - they tackle on another social issue which was relevant with (Korean) students, Suga and Rapmon also presented contrasting arguments/perspectives

[Bapsae](https://muish.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/bts-baepsae-english-translation-ramblings/) -talks about social status and generation gap, the translator also associated it with BTS who had started from the bottom and came from a small company

There were also a few songs from RM and Suga's mixtape including J-hope's [1verse](https://muish.wordpress.com/2016/08/01/j-hope-bts-1-verse-english-translation-and-ramblings/) 

For us, foreign fans, a lot of their lyrics which are very relevant often get lost in translation so I appreciate the translator's effort in further explaining the meaning of BTS' songs/lyrics especially that of the rapline's.

----------

Hello again r/bangtan!! 

As some of you know we are planning on doing more projects as a subreddit for the boys from now on. They will be mainly birthdays, anniversaries, and sending congratulations when each of the boys branch out to do individual activities, besides planning something for the Big Hit staff. More information about each project will be released as we get closer to the date of each event, so watch out for surveys or discussion posts related to the projects. Normally, we will try to title project-related posts like this one: *[BTS PROJECT] Name of that project* . 

&amp;nbsp;

But, onto the main purpose of this post! 

As many of you guys know, V's debut drama will air this December. Since it's a big milestone for him, we would like to send rice wreaths to his drama's press conference to congratulate him. As u/queenbratinella (the coordinator with the most experience) suggested, we will be ordering the rice wreaths through [Dreame Korea](https://dreame.co.kr:127/en/). DK will take care of arranging everything necessary to deliver the rice wreaths, so we just need to focus on raising money to buy the wreaths.

The plan is to choose a modest arrangement so more of the money can be put towards buying the rice bags. **The more simple arrangements start at around $110 USD and each bag of rice (10 kg = 22 lbs) is around $25 USD**. Ideally, we would like to raise $200 USD. Now, it may seem like an impossible goal, but if everybody pitches in $2 USD we're good!!

We were blown away by the power of us coming together for the Yoongi project, so we can do this!! You guys can [start donating now](https://paypal.me/foryoongs/2) if you'd like. However, don't feel pressured or in a rush. **We will leave the donations open until the first week of December** so you have ample time. Also, please read [these instructions](http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) before donating through PayPal. 

####**IMPORTANT:** Note that when making the donation, there will be an option to write a note. Please remember to specify your reddit username AND the project you are donating for (e.g. janecitizen; V Rice Wreaths). 

One last thing...for those of you that asked if they could donate more than the minimum, yes. We just set a $2 USD minimum to guarantee everyone could participate.

Also, we would like to point out that **if for whatever reason the project is not able to be carried out we will refund you guys your money**. Fingers crossed everything goes without as much as a hiccup.

We will be posting updates of the project to this post as we go along (so save this post if you want to see the projects progress). Like with the Yoongi project, we will also do a final post summarizing and closing the project...so keep an eye out for that post as well!

We hope a lot of you guys can participate, and thank you guys for wanting to participate in more projects as a subreddit. This is just the beginning of many more to come!!

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely,

The BTS Projects Team &lt;3",23,81
