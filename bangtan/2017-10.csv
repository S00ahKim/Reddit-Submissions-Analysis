I liked DNA when I listened to it. (Hear me out) I didn't love it, it wasn't my favourite but it was good. I loved the beginning, I loved how each member got a good amount of likes, I loved how it played to many of their strengths. 

When I first heard the ad on Spotify I was proud of BTS for getting recognition. Then I heard it again and again. Almost every group of ads included BTS. I understand why BTS is advertising like this of course. They're one of, if not THE most successful Kpop group ever and now they're trying to bring in new people that aren't into Kpop yet. 

But they're doing it wrong. They're forcing it. This isn't appealing to people who aren't into Kpop and honestly it's annoying to me. On two occasions I was listening to Her and was interrupted by *the ad*. When I listen to DNA now, after the chorus I expect to hear Rapmon introduce BTS. I've asked 4 of my friends who aren't into Kpop  about their opinion and all of them said that the ad irritated them a lot.

This isn't to say that this ad ruined the song or album and destroyed any chance of getting more supporters but overall I think it has had a negative impact and the marketing team for BTS needs to rethink their strategy. ",29,3

36,2017-10-2,2017,10,2,18,73rs4h,Interpretation of Outro: Her Lyrics,theBangTan,1506936950,"I was listening to Outro: Her today and reading the lyrics, and they struck me as very interesting, and also very odd. Here are the lyrics: [lyrics](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2017/09/bts-bangtansonyeondan-outro),  [lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yoQ6a1wRvc)   
    
I definitely think this isn't a song to be taken at face value, so I've been trying to understand what the true message of the song is, and I've arrived at two different ideas.   
    
The first is that the song describes the idol-fan relationship. I think this goes along really well with the rest of the album: Pied Piper, as we've previously discussed on the sub, is about the dangers of the idol-fan relationship from the fan's point of view. It's a message of, ""yes, we're addictive, and tbh we need you guys to be addicted to us as well, but at the same time, don't let us take over your lives."" And I think Outro: Her might be again illustrating the dangers of the idol-fan relationship, but this time from the idol's point of view. It makes a lot of sense, especially the lines ""Because your laughter and happiness / Is the scale of my happiness"", ""Do I deserve your love? / I always make an effort to be the best for you / I hope you dont know this part of me"", and ""I cant ever take off this mask / Because Im not the guy you know under this mask."" As idols, they depend extremely heavily on their fans, but it's a very bittersweet relationship. On one hand, they are thankful for all the love they receive from their fans, but on the other hand, they must wonder if their fans love them for who they really are, or simply for the images they put out. These are the sentiments of the hidden Skit: Hesitation and Fear as well, as the boys wonder about how they can never truly be showing their genuine selves, no matter how hard they try... even when they do their iconic socially-conscious songs, they have to wonder whether they're doing them for themselves or if they're doing them because that's what's expected of them.   
   
My other idea for what this outro might mean is that it's showing the other side of the character portrayed in Love Yourself. To be honest, I was very surprised when reading the lyrics to this album for the first time, because I remember Rap Monster saying in an interview that the meaning of Love Yourself is that one cannot truly be able to love someone else until they can first love themselves. I thought that was a really meaningful sentiment, so I was surprised that many of the songs in this album were purely romantic love songs, and none really addressed the issue of loving yourself first and foremost. However, I think that the Outro might be a segue into the concept of the next album, which might dig deeper into the dangers of loving someone else when you can't even love yourself. The outro starts with a guy who has a lot of complexes but is just looking for love, and finds someone who he believes can complete him. He acknowledges that it's a fake version of him, but he doesn't care. He can't ever take the mask off for fear of losing that love, and questions if he even deserves love in the first place. It's not a healthy relationship, but he cannot see that; instead, he is completely consumed by the idea of love and trying to maintain this fake image of himself, for fear of losing his love. If this is the case, perhaps the next album(s) will elaborate on this theme. Maybe this first album was an introduction to show how love, at first, feels serendipitous and perfect, but the next albums will show how if you don't love yourself, then love can quickly become an unhealthy coping mechanism rather than a healthy relationship, since you become completely reliant on another person to complete you. In fact, a relationship can only happen when both people are already complete to begin with.  
   
Of course, both of these are just my random theories. Maybe they're both true, and maybe they're both wrong. It really doesn't matter, since songs are up to the listeners interpretation anyways, but I'm curious to see what you guys think. Do you agree with one of these ideas more than the other? Or do you interpret the song in a completely different way? Also, what do you think the chorus ""I call you her, her / Cause youre my tear, tear"" means?   
    
Thank you so much if you read all that btw, I'm sorry for the long post :) I look forward to reading your interpretations!",14,55

But more so the things bts say, or their actions. I know it's kind of inevitable with the amount of content they put out, but sometimes I feel like fans overstep their boundaries. We don't know them personally, or how they are irl so I really hate all the unnecessary speculation about their personalities. It's especially annoying when fans get offended or sad about things they assumed on their own.

A good example would be, when the translation to the second skit came out (I'm talking about the hidden track on HER) Felt like most people missed the whole point and got unnecessarily fixated on how they were ""faking it"", people trying to figure out which member is fake, which one isn't, people feeling betrayed.

I keep noticing little unique things about all the comeback stages. For example: DNA has a ton of old BTS dance choreo in it, which aside from being a fun thing for ARMY to pick out, also pays homage to their journey over the last four years.

What others stories or hidden meanings did you see in BTS's choreography for DNA, Go Go and Mic Drop? Did you pick up on any fun choreo moves? What were your favorite moments in the choreos?

1) some of the mods here (mods let me know if this is okay)

2) older fans (noonas here's your chance to shine!)

3) fans who identify as male

4) fans who live outside the U.S.

Some notes about these interviews: I would like to do these over some type of chat/Skype where I can hear your voice at the very least. I would also like to record the interviews, so that I can go over them again later on. In addition, I can assure you that I will maintain your privacy when I use the data collected from the interview for my paper. As stated in my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70nxgv/research_for_college_class_on_rbangtan/), this paper is for my college level class and will not be published in any academic setting. However, some of the people here expressed interest in reading this paper, so I will be sharing the final paper here. That being said, I will ensure that if you agree to an interview your personal information will remain anonymous.

If you could comment here so that I can DM you and set up an interview date/time that would be great! Thanks again for helping out with this project. My professor really likes this idea and how I've set it up.

Edit 1: formatting; also if you don't fit these descriptions I would still like to potentially interview you!

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for responding!! I'm overwhelmed by the responses, but I'm determined to incorporate everyone's thoughts! I will keep in touch!",91,20

This is a game to determine which BTS dance/choreo we like best. All you have to do is **vote for the choreography you like the least**. Whichever choreography gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds. A new round ^(usually) gets posted every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

Oh and by the way this isn't really a b-side only survivor, I decided to add the concept trailer and intro performance trailer because they're just too good lol, I hope you all agree with their addition. If you don't then we can take them out next round!

I also had a hard time deciding what is considered a choreo and what isn't... songs like *If I Ruled The World* and *  (Where did you come from?)* are very basic compared to most of their dances but in the end I decided to add them too. If you don't think they fit here either then we can take them out as well.

**/!\** I added the question mark on the title because tbh I'm not sure if I got every choreo, I feel like I forgot some but I'm not sure... **If you find any of their b-side choreos missing please tell me and we'll redo this round!!!!**

However, I'm fairly new to the kpop scene (i've only heard a few kpop songs here and there) and seeing BTS itself + their success makes me wonder what sets them apart from the rest.

For me one of the first videos I watched if I rmbr correctly, was the sunset glow/fantastic baby bangtan bomb where JM and tae were dancing to those songs in the dressing room. And I was just thinking ""wow these guys look really feminin"" because of all the makeup. Especially for me, being a korean canadian growing up I really disliked kpop because I felt like it gave us koreans a bad name, cause let's be honest, some kpop is weeird. But at the same time I thought JM and Tae were good looking, that it disturbed me. (I'm a guy). While I would find it so weird that they looked so ""girly"" (words I used at the time) there was something so addictive about their bangtan bombs that I kept coming back and watching their vids even though their physical appearance and kpop in general threw me off. Especially when I watched ""its tricky"" I would be so conflicted because i'm watching 7 korean guys dance really well, in perfect synchronisation, and no one said a word. But because of the makeup, I experienced this mixture of finding it so weird, yet addictive cause they were so cool and talented.

But after binging many bombs, MVs, interviews and after listening to all their songs, it didn't take me long to stop caring anout the makeup/feminin aspect and just enjoy BTS! And now I can truly say they're my absolute favourite artist and genre of music.

What about you guys? What were your first thoughts, impressions, judgements? Did you not like them at first or not care? If so what eventually won you over?

They are looking into getting the other versions

Changed her name to REP in as I didn't ask her permission to post her name:

REP: For this general album, this will be restocked again but for the other version. we are actually for the manufacturer to send us other versions since the we already have the general album. I understand your point about separating it so we'll take note of your suggestion.
 
Me: ah, okay so they're all L's
 
REP: Yes, as for now.
 
Me: got it thanks!
 
REP: Sure, you're welcome. It seems you like BTS. I like them too actually. I'm gald you have spoken with me. i can actually send a feedback about the request for other version. We just need some information like your email address and your first and last name.
 
Me: Ha I'm glad I got you too! Sorry about the overexplaining, when talking to best buy they were super confused about the whole LOVE situation since it's 1 UPC
 
REP: Yes, I actually understand your situation. I was also glad seeing here in our website that the L version is available and I'm even asking my other support here when would be the other versions will be available but they say we're still waiting for the updates from the sender of this one.
 
REP: Actually, the album was *sold out immediately.* I was really thrilled seeing BTS merchandise here.

151,2017-10-6,2017,10,6,2,74hcct,How buying albums outside of Korea still helps BTS,maplecookie1127,1507223075,"Hi everyone, I would like to open a discussion about this because I think there is a lot of confusion in the fandom about the sales of *Love Yourself: Her* in North America. Does it count on the charts, does it include a poster, and why is it still so darn hard to find?

I want to preface that I am an older fan and I have worked in some areas of the music industry over the years, but I am still not an expert in everything, so that is why I am coming to you, so we can pool our resources and wisdom together! I may have a very different perspective on things and I am more than willing to hear everyone's opinions.

First of all, speaking as a former Walmart employee, no your purchase will *not* include a poster! If Walmart gives bonus gifts with an album, a movie, etc., it means there is an agreement between the label and the store, and it's usually coming from the big guys like Warner and Sony as a promotional thing. I doubt Big Hit would want to jump into something like that, as you can see, the quantities are very limited. Testing the waters, I assume, which is smart.

Two, and I am a solid 80% sure of this, that sales of the album in North America will not count towards Hanteo. This is an educated guess, I do not have this in writing, but an album is being distributed and sold in North America, so it is highly unlikely that Walmart has registered with Hanteo in order to record sales and therefore, chart. According to the Billboard website, Billboard charts deal with Nielsen Soundscan, and Nielsen Soundscan are attached to the major retailers. Who is bigger than Walmart and Target? So I can conclude that buying the album from a North American retailer, online store, or streaming service will result in a Billboard spot, as BTS have done already, as we have been listening to the heck out of this album.

So at the end of the day, buying, shipping, and streaming the album here is good because it shows Big Hit of the growing demand for BTS. Sales = popularity in the eyes of any record label, and if it's selling here, well, it means we have better chances of concerts, interviews, awards shows, TV appearances, etc. They've done so well already without any airplay; they have still sold out arenas in the US. But we all know, we want them to play more cities! If this is not as important to you as their success in their motherland, then you should always be buying directly from Asia. A lot of fans have been indoctrinated to believe this is the only way to support their k-pop groups, and in many cases, it is. I understand the value in this, but BTS has successfully crossed over, so I feel we should keep helping them on this side of the Pacific too, and prove to them they're on the right path. They're not a flash in the pan.

I welcome all of your thoughts about this, and any other resources I can look at about the subject. Thanks for hearing me out.",14,61

We've got a lot of seasoned k-pop fans here for sure, but I definitely recall seeing some older members of the sub reminiscing about being all over the Backstreet Boys, some people repping anime, some Harry Potter, some newcomers to fandom, e.t.c.

So basically, which fanbases did you consider yourself a part of in the past (like what was your fandom trajectory)? How would you compare your previous experiences in fandom to being a part of ARMY?

eg. In my case...uh...if we're going super way back it all started with OHSHC and Fruits Basket in middle school. From there it went Axis Powers Hetalia &gt; Sherlock &gt; Homestuck &gt; Some J-artists I love *very* dearly who barely have overseas fanbases &gt; BTS.

I find that none of my previous fandom experiences quite compare to this, though. (ARMY is just so *massive*. I feel like I'm part of a powerful, exhilarating, and slightly terrifying hivemind.)",81,33

I'm a 17-year-old student from New Zealand and I do some freelance video work and love all things video production. So when I first watched the MV for 'Not Today' I thought it was the film side of things that had me shook. But as I watched more and more I started to love everything. The dancing, the production, the vocals, the rap, the VFX, the clothes and even the members.

Following up to now I'm still listening to them. Now the only difference is I know all of their names and have a bias and everything (V fyi). It's a scary transformation not gonna lie. 

But I'd love to hear from other people similar to me and see why you like BTS. I think this would be a fun little thread and I look forward to hearing from some of you. 

:)

(EDIT: I think I mistitled this post a little bit which I apologize for. It kind of makes it sound like I'm fed up with female fans, gay male fans, and Asian fans which I am absolutely not. Also, whether you're gay/straight/bi doesn't have much to do with it, so I again apologize for bringing that into this for those who were offended. So please feel free to leave a comment even if you're anything other then a straight, non-asian male. I just want to have a fun discussion with everyone! :)",138,99

Yesterday there was a &gt;40k Gap between #1 BTS and #2 EXO. I just checked and it decreased to a bit more than 10k. If it continues like that, we will lose the number one spot and the only chance to nominate 'DNA' for MAMA. 
(Edit: There is almost 100k gap now! But keep going so mass votings by other fandoms won't effect our spot.)


#*Voting period: Oct 1, 2017 - Oct 16, 2017 24:00 (KST)*

Remember to vote everyday, you even get a change to win a MAMA ticket if you need more motivation. In overall, creating one account takes less than 3 minutes if you do it correctly and VOTING will take less than 1-2 minutes if there is little traffic. 

If you have problems, please try to explain it here and look for help because every vote counts. 

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;



There are lots of Twitter accounts that update you regurlarly and people who give you free accounts to vote (you just have to DM and ask them and they will give you e-mail + password), so you don't have to create them yourself.

Also, would appreciates links to videos that are particularly touching (ie. V talking about his grandmother passing away before she could see him on TV).

My name is Marta, I'm **Aeon Dream Studios**' Art Director and Lead Artist for ""**To The Edge of The Sky**"", a BTS inspired Visual Novel. 
I'm a big fan of /r/bangtan for your mature views and commentary on BTS and their endeavors, as well as the love and support you show to fan-made projects, some of which I've posted myself before.

We just released the second demo [(TTEOTS - PHASe II)](https://aeondreamstudios.itch.io/to-the-edge-of-the-sky) of our game as well as the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aeondreamstudios/to-the-edge-of-the-sky-a-fanmade-bts-inspired-visu/description) upon ARMYs request to fund a full release! You can read all of our intentions and the game's features on our KS page :D

The game will be **FREE** for everyone upon release, we're diving into this project with the utmost respect for BTS as well as ARMY, we are serious developers, and as such I would like to ask your honest opinions and feedback, either about the project as whole, or specifics of the game.

It is important for us to release a product everyone can be proud of, and if we could have reddit's support going forth, it would be incredibly uplifting and motivating! :D",18,104

408,2017-10-15,2017,10,15,10,76g4om,What is your favorite BTS intro track? Why?,ayyypokkai,1508030590,"Now we all know how special an intro track is - it's not merely a song, but a song that introduces the whole album and gives the listeners an idea of what to expect of. Thus, the flow and transition of the intro track and the following songs are important. Below are the intro tracks of BTS' albums from latest to earliest:

- [Serendipity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEMaH9Sm3lQ) (Intro to DNA, Love Yourself:Her)
- [Boy Meets Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJJSh-eEdRk) (Intro to Blood, Sweat and Tears, Wings)
- [Never Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u8D5Gwk55w) (Intro to Run, HYYH pt.2)
- [HwaYangYeonHwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nN8v3LJQrg) (Intro to I Need U, HYYH pt.1)
- [What Am I to You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_nfKfAnZ2A) (Intro to Danger, Dark &amp; Wild)
- [Skool Luv Affair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lKeF2CDGbk) (Intro to Boy in Luv, Skool Luv Affair)
- [O!RUL8,2?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8AFmRbvHTk) (Intro to N.O., O!RUL8,2?)
- [2 Cool 4 Skool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DXLor81JlE) (Intro to WAP Pt.2, 2 Cool 4 Skool)

For me, my top 3 favorites (not ranked) are Serendipity, BME, and Never Mind. However if I have to choose the best, I will most definitely hand it to Boy Meets Evil. Even without the performance (and a goddamn good performance, that is), the track just captures the mood of the album so well  dark, gritty, seductive, the instrumentals just lures you in. JKs chorus, J-Hopes faint chanting in the end, followed by Jimins breathy notes in the beginning of BST its such a perfect transition. The flow is well done, and it builds up the tension to BST so nicely. It's a shame I actually listened to BST first when it first came out before listening to BME!

Serendipity and DNAs lyrics are complementary in a cute way  this serendipity, its meant to be, its in our DNA. Serendipity is an amazing song, but I cant help thinking that the music would have a better flow if it was followed by either Pied Piper or dimple, as Serendipity has a very dreamy vibe to it and DNA kinda vaporizes the dreamy feel instead.

Never Mind and HYYH has the best lyrics, props to Suga. The two tracks just screams Agust D. However, both of the intro definitely overpowers the title track *a lot*, especially HYYH and I Need U (the lyrics of which is explicitly about a girls love while the other is about oneself). Strangely enough, both of these intros probably would have sounded better with either the earlier hip-hop albums or Wings. Nevertheless, Never Mind is still one of my hype songs.

Also, I feel like Skool Luv Affair and Dark &amp; Wild should have switched intros (music wise, not lyrically). I mean, What Am I To You literally has a school bell in the background, and Boy in Luv is in a classroom setting. The sleek vibe Skool Luv Affair exhibits matches the vibe of Danger too.

Damn, I've written an essay again. tl;dr: I think Boy Meets Evil is my favorite. How about you guys?

 it's so thorough, thanks for the hard work!- and I was tasked with the *impossible* choice of picking between Blanket Kick and 24/7= Heaven. As I re-listened to 24/7, I just thought about how much this song screams *Hoseok* to me. It's so positive, puts a big grin on my face, seems really optimistic and playful...overall it fills me with so much joy every time I listen to it. It's the perfect encapsulation of everything he is, to his members and to the fandom. I wanted to ask you guys what you think for your own bias :)

So, only choose one member, preferably your bias (only because I'm sure you all will be very passionate about your selections, lol). No solos, including intros. Please feel free to explain why you chose the song for each member!",28,43

I'm especially curious about Jin and Jimin, who are usually (and I guess justifiably? IDK, I'm not an expert, which is why I'm posting this) regarded as the weaker vocalists. I'm pretty certain that, with adequate training, Jungkook and V could be amazing (especially Jungkook, who seems to possess considerable musical aptitude considering how well he sings given the limited training he appears to have received), although I could be wrong about this. I've also seen comments about Jimin has a really high ceiling (this is a comment Yoongi and Jungkook have made as well), but I dunno how much credence to attach to this. What about Jin? Could he become a potent singer as well? I personally hope so, although I might be indulging in a lot of wishful thinking tbh (my co-biases are Jungkook and Jin so...).",49,41

We've just wrapped up Jimin's birthday project! Yay!! 

Before we get to the final closing post, we just want to share with you some of the details of our next projects. These will be Jin and V's birthday projects. The theme for the Jin project is Eat Jin (sharing recipes and food memories, as well as the usual fan art and messages); the theme for the V project is photography, fanart, art and crafts inspired by favorite photographers, artists and other creatives in the theme of Vante (in addition to the usual messages). As usual, you do not have to follow the theme to submit an entry or message, all entries are welcome. We are currently researching charities for the donations for these projects and will update everyone as soon as we can. If you have any ideas for charities, please leave them below or PM us.  

Please also watch out for the Secret Santa coming out veryyy soon! (Edit: [We have posted the guidelines post for participating in the Secret Santa](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/771gjm/rbangtans_2017_secret_santa). Guys, it's happening!!)

We will also be doing another [census project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/) like last year, and more details will come in mid-late November. 

---

&amp;nbsp; 

For the format for Jimin's gift, we created a book as well as donated to a charity to celebrate Jimin! Since Jimin is the one that captures many of the memories for BTS, we decided to create a book for him that captured our memories to share with him. This also included fanart and photography since he's always sharing these things with us! 

The book for Jimin was 8 x 10 in/ 21 x 26 cm and came to 64 pages. We were inspired by Serendipity's lyrics and created a [tiny blue mold cat](https://imgur.com/a/XRcBO). Like with some of the other books we've made, we used a flipbook style artwork in the corner. This one is the little tiny cat being squeezed out of an eyedropper into a petri dish, it's [super cute](https://imgur.com/QNjAgwV)!

For our gift to Jimin, we were able to donate USD$262.00 to CATS (Cats Assistance in Transitional Shelter), Whiskers Ministop! They are a private non-profit cat rehoming &amp; no-kill shelter located in Seoul, as [Jimin](http://pm1.narvii.com/6541/bf4b3cbdf08627dd55700f3b139c37724c986228_hq.jpg) [loves](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CpWaeJjXEAAqw4H.jpg) [cats](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/81/c3/ab81c36f9f62b07092751febd51f4b49.jpg), and to match our cat theme. They posted about our donation on their [FB](https://www.facebook.com/whiskersministop/videos/1063509677085630/) and [IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaWD99pFcrq/)! If you would like to support them in the future, you can contact them for details and they accept PayPal donations.

Since we wish to be 100% transparent, we apologize once again for the delay of the printing and shipping due to various real-life circumstances. We will try to be as timely as possible in the future.

We will update the subreddit with pictures/video of the book soon!

We want to thank everyone that took part for this project; everyone who sent in lovely messages and memories, and in particular the donors for their generosity, and the coordinators for their time. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Thank you once again for supporting our projects, and we look forward to working with you on further projects.

Well, its October. Where has this year gone?!? It feels like just yesterday we were waiting for YNWA to be released, then we were all voting our butts off to get the guys that Billboard win, and now weve made it through their biggest comeback to date (and scored them that Hot100 placing they wanted)!  Now that were just 11 weekends away from Christmas, its time for us to roll out the first ever sub Secret Santa project!!

Weve made a couple of mentions of it before, but in this post, we will explain exactly how it will work and how you can participate. We hope that this will be a fun way for everyone to interact with each other, make new friends, and get some cool Kpop merchandise.

&amp;nbsp;

Heres how this will work:

We are opening a [registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/t3nnm2BSH5hIFVJw2) for you guys to fill out which will be used to match you with a fellow r/bangtan redditor. We will use things such as geographical location (to keep shipping costs down) and budgets to help match. This registration form will **close Oct 31st At 10pm-ish US CST**.

After the matches have been made, emails will be sent to everyone with your matchs info so you can start shopping. I hope to have **everyone matched and notified by Nov. 6th**. Once matched, you will be added to the Secret Santa subreddit that we created so we could keep all updates and information posts in one easy to find place. From there, we will have deadlines for submitting proof that you have purchased your gifts, and again when its time to ship them (possibly, around Dec. 20th - 22nd). Then comes the fun part, seeing all the posts after everyones gifts start arriving!

Now, we ask that you be 100% certain that you can and want to participate before you sign up, because we obviously dont want to leave anyone without a match, and in turn, without a gift. We understand that life happens, but **if you have to drop out after matching** has taken place, you will not be allowed to participate in the program next year. Likewise, **if you fail to provide proof of shipping for your gifts, you will be dropped and not allowed to participate next year**.

We want this to go as smoothly as possible, so we ask that everybody please do their part and adhere to the rules and deadlines. **Please keep in mind, this is the sub's first Secret Santa**, and my first time ever organizing something like this for this many people. There are bound to be hiccups, so **please participate at your own risk**. I do have some measures in place to try and compensate if we should run into a problem or two, but most of the funds for this is coming out of my own pocket and unfortunately theyre not as deep as Id like them to be. Lol

^(**Brief disclaimer:** I, u/Erinzilla83, and the BTS Projects Team, are not affiliated with r/bangtan's mods. The r/bangtan mods were kind enough to allow us to run the sub's first Secret Santa.) 

&amp;nbsp;

We have created a separate subreddit just for this project, so once you are matched, you will be added to it! It will be the place to ask questions, find answers, keep up with deadlines, and for general announcements about the project. There will be an FAQ put up there that will cover things like shipping and proof emails more in depth.

Also, **for those of you who arent able to participate because its just not in your budget this year, keep an eye out ;)** I may have put together a little something. Again, I wont be able to cover everyone because my lottery winnings havent come in yet (I wish!), but I didnt want to just leave out those of you on the broke college kid (or just broke adult) budget. :)

&amp;nbsp;

**Alrighty, let's do a quick recap!!**

**1. Fill out the [Secret Santa registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/t3nnm2BSH5hIFVJw2)** - Please be as thorough as possible so your Secret Santa can have as much info as possible to buy you a fitting gift. **Registration closes OCT. 31st at 10 pm US CST**.

**2. Matching** - We will try to have everyone matched and email you guys your matches ^(Beultoreune. **FAYEEEEER!!**) by Nov 6th. This is a tentative deadline and subject to change after the registration form closes. We will update you guys in this.

**3. Buying and shipping gifts** - Once you receive your assigned subredditor, you can start preparing their gift. **We will have checkpoints to make sure no one is left without a gift**. More info about this will be posted on the Secret Santa sub's FAQ.

**4. Post your gift!** - Once you have received your gift, you can post pictures to share with the rest of the Secret Santa participants if you'd like.

&amp;nbsp;

We hope this post helped clear some questions about the way the Secret Santa will be carried out. If you guys have any more questions, feel free to PM us at u/BTS_SecretSanta.

We look forward to participating and spreading some holiday cheer with you guys!!

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely,

u/Erinzilla83 and the BTS Projects Team

Please forgive me if I posted this wrong - this is my first post despite hovering this sub for a long time and commenting here and there.

Amazon has mistakenly sent me 3 L versions and 1 V version, even though they assured me I would get the whole set - but hey.. mistakes happen.

I am looking for someone who would want to either buy them for what they're worth on Amazon - $21.98 USD, or if anybody had the same luck as me and have too many O or E versions I am up for a trade. 

Shipping would depend on where you're from but preferably this sale/trade can happen in Canada, as I am in Ottawa, ON, or the US wouldn't be so bad. 

I received the versions with the posters so if you want to trade I would prefer to receive the corresponding posters for the O and E versions too. 

The photo cards in the L versions I have are 2 J-Hope and 1 Rap Monster. (fun fact: I have gotten RM in most of my albums, and ZERO of my bias V) 

Please message me if interested! Thanks, ARMY!",5,20

What would it take to get BTS shows on Netflix? I don't know anything about the licensing that would be needed, but if I could finally watch Bon Voyage without feeling guilty it'd be great. Hopefully BTS will be on soon on one of the variety shows on there, ""Chef &amp; My Fridge"" for example, is Please Take Care of My Refrigerator, but I'm not sure when it updates.

My best friend and I have planned a trip to South Korea since early this year and coincidently BTS announces their final concert in Seoul during the dates we are there. So we're really desperate to get tickets because it will make/break the trip right now :(( Our options include:

* 1. Buying from ticketbis/stubhub 
* 2. Using KoreanBuddy's services and buying from TicketBay 
* 3. Paying to use an official ARMY's ID if they're not going (haven't been able to find anyone)

I already know this post regarding the concert by heart btw: [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6pt7j7/2017_bts_live_trilogy_episode_%E2%85%B2_the_wings_tour/)

I would just like to hear about any more experiences and know on which website our chances will be better at securing tickets. Would anyone also have any information on whether we'll be able to purchase tickets seated next to each other? Thanks a lot in advance for any advice! 

TL;DR What is the best way to secure tickets for a BTS concert in Seoul as an international ARMY?",30,24

Please note that these codes are based on what we see in western, primarily American, media. This can apply to other countries but I dont want to make assumptions. There are of course exceptions to every rule but quite a bit of their photoshoots, especially the most recent ones defy traditional western masculine coding. 

So basically, the codes go as follows (this is based on a series of readings and the documentary The Codes of Gender: Identity and Performance in Pop Culture).

Hands and their relationship to reality:
     -	A womans hands are never in control, they rarely carry or 
        strongly grasp rather they trace or hold with the tips of their 
        fingers.
     -	Male Hands are powerful and assertive, they are strong and 
        in control never at the mercy of others.
     -	Womens are posed holding themselves in a delicate, almost 
        protective manner.

Ritualization of Subordination:
     -	Women are often shown laying down (also includes the body 
        and face cants) meaning that they are dependent on the 
        benign of the surround. 
     -	When men are portrayed with the women, men are posed as 
        ready for action and as the dominant body. 

Psychological Relation
      -	Unfocused relation, dreamy. Again, a vulnerable 
        gaze/mentality.
      -	Whenever they are not withdrawn they are overly engaged, 
        big smile or laugh. Essentially an obvious loss of control.
      -	Men are hyper focused, serving as an anchor and protector to 
        the female counterpart.

Codes of Masculinity:
      -	Opposite of what the culture defines as feminine.
      -	Common poses are standing upright hand in pockets or 
        folded over their chest. Body language is usually confident or 
        even an assured relaxed stance. Men are also pictured as 
        actively taking part in the world.

For reference I grabbed a few random pictures from the most recent eras. 

Bangtan rarely has photoshoots were their gazes make a strong connection with the camera, it tends to be much softer and heavy lidded [1](https://imgur.com/yeEfGln), [2](https://imgur.com/4FusUqY), [3](https://imgur.com/l4rKUPB). They also have a lot of shoots where theyre resting on each other, almost asleep [1](https://imgur.com/qHHYR7O), [2](https://imgur.com/exvWuzh),. If you look up shoots of One direction for example, the grand majority have them standing straight looking at the camera and their feet firmly planted on the ground. Group shots where they actually touch each other are usually just a hand on the shoulder or even just a slight brush of the shoulder. In contrast Bangtan heavily recline on each other, they are overly playful almost childish and this is a code generally applied to groups of women in photo-shoots [1](https://imgur.com/XSNGWY9), [2] (https://imgur.com/bR8mVUf), [3](https://imgur.com/uOtkRKr). The exaggerated facial expressions are also found here, a smile or a smirk is common but BTS has pretty over the top facial expressions. You wont really see this on male models when you flick through magazines in the US. 

Bangtan is also posed in very vulnerable positions, laying down, reclining against a wall, sleeping, or standing in a way where they could easily fall over [1](https://imgur.com/rw8oD26). These are poses commonly found in photoshoots coded as feminine.  

When it comes to Bangtans hands they are usually posed delicately, in the pictures they sometimes touch their face, hugging themselves, or grasping things lightly [1](https://imgur.com/6zfleGa), [2](https://imgur.com/yfSltfz). I cant remember the last time I saw a BTS photoshoot where they have a strong grip on something. 

These are only a few examples and can't be universally applied since there are a few that are slightly more traditionally coded masculine but overall they tend to lean more toward poses that break the code. In the western media most instances where male shoots broke the code or where coded as more femenine would either be magazines aimed at a gay audience or they would make up for it by finding a way to assure the viewer that these were still ""real men"" by showcasing obvious muscles or adding a woman to the shoot. 

Let me know if this even made sense or if you have any questions! I'm running on 3/4 hours of sleep.

##Regarding random post removals

Hello, folks!

As some of you might have noticed when making new posts, sometimes they will be randomly removed and there will be no comment from a moderator explaining the reason. We would like to make clear that **the random removal of posts is happening because of something on reddit's end**. If a moderator removes your post, a comment will always be left. If there is no comment, then your post was automatically removed by reddit and taken to our spam filter.

We make an effort to periodically check our spam, but because of the amount of things being removed some might slip by. In case you make a post and it doesn't show in /new and there isn't a comment left by a moderator, you are free to send us modmail inquiring about it.

Also as a reminder, please don't forget to check our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) and [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index)!

[Here's a short video of the actual book](https://youtu.be/1Ml8eRtgYUk), and we'd like to thank the lovely u/AverageAnnie for receiving the book in Korea and sending it on to BigHit.

The book for Jimin was 8 x 10 in (21 x 26 cm) and came to 64 pages. Like with some of the other books we've made, we used a flipbook style artwork in the corner. This one is the little tiny cat being squeezed out of an eyedropper into a petri dish, it's [super cute](https://imgur.com/QNjAgwV)!

DISCLAIMER: For the vocal line I'm just gonna put this out therethe entirety of LY:Her, yall. They're killing it. 

**J-hope** - Whalien 52, his rap / This song just feels so...*J-hope*, and his part really showcases the full gamut of what he can do with his voice. 

**Suga** - Ma City, his rap / UGH. Everything about this is perfect. I love how he sounds like he's running out of breath but he just goes higher and harder and faster until it erupts in a crescendo of ""COME TO MY CITY"". 

**Jimin** - BST, the opening lines / Its so iconic I cant not pick it. (Also likeSerendipitybut that feels like cheating lol)

**Jin** - I NEED U,  around 1:50 / The pleading tone of his voice fits this song so well, it tugs on my heartstrings without fail.

**Jungkook** -  Love is not Over, 2:50 / I dont even know what to say, he just sounds so beautiful

**Taehyung** - Dead Leaves, the bridge (?) / His low tone fits perfectly between the chorus and J-hopes incredibly emotional rap. 

**Rapmon** - Ma City, his rap / Im sorry I just *really* *really* *really* love Ma City. Especially the part at 0:42 after city of mon where the pace of his rapping &amp; the instrumentation change, its so satisfying.

715,2017-10-29,2017,10,29,4,79c6un,Google Drive Jimin folder,chimothypark,1509220344,"Hello everyone!
&amp;nbsp;

So for some time now I've been slowly putting together my **[Jimin folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3Dkzhp0XKZvelNqUEhCaDl3TGM)** which I update daily, and I've uploaded it on Google Drive so anyone can access it anywhere anytime.

I've built this folder within the span of a few months so there's plenty of things that are messy and not as organized as I would like but hey, let's say it's at least mostly organized.


&amp;nbsp;

I like to think that there are a few uses for this folder:

1. Folders like *Pictures*, *Fansigns* and *Airport Photos* get updated whenever they have a new schedule with both previews and HD photos. So let's say they just had a concert, you'll find concert previews and HDs of Jimin probably within the day in their own folder in *Pictures*. Let's say they just had a fansign, you'll find new photos of him in *Fansigns*. Let's say they left for Japan, you'll find new photos of him in *Airport Photos*. I follow every single active Jimin fansite there is so if you save photos daily like me but miss some days you'll be sure to find them there, or if you just casually wanna look at photos without having to go through your twitter feed you can look through my folders. Of course sometimes I stay behind schedule but I save everything as soon as I can.

2. Second use I would give the folder is that of looking at small compilations I have created - There's a folder for his front tooth, one for the way he holds his mic, one for his smiles and laughs, one for his kisses and hearts, one for the way he stands with his feet pointed outwards, one of him with contact lenses on, and so on. And within some of these folders, there might be smaller compilations of things he does (if you search for things like ""thighs"", ""arms"", ""scrunch"", ""pout"" and so on you'll find a bunch of files I have saved up under different folders). 

3. Another use I can give it would be finding photos of him with a certain hair color. I have many photos named under ""brown"", ""pink"", ""silver"" and so on, and while some are also not directly named like that, they are saved under folders that are so they come up in search too. So for example if you search for ""brown"" you can see plenty of photos of him with brown hair. (Small note here, I call his orange hair mozilla and not orange, so.. do what you want with that information).

&amp;nbsp;

Some other big folders you might wanna look at:

1. **Yellow card folder** - for everything adorable

2. **God's blessing folder** - for his natural self

3. **Sin folder** - self explanatory


&amp;nbsp;

**A small note:**
I'm a new fan (I've been listening to them since 2013 but I only really got to know them in 2016) and made this folder in April. I only started creating folders for each of his new appearances around May. For photos before that, I have saved random ones under *Pictures*, and other than that I have created what I call a *Directory of iconic looks* where some of my favourite looks of his from when I still wasn't around got their own particular folders. So, don't expect to see folders of each appearance of his since debut because I only started doing this in May. You get the idea.


&amp;nbsp;

Now, there are folders that are way too big for their own good, and ones that I haven't really updated or added things in. 
But all in all, the folder can work for those who wanna be updated daily, or for those who just wanna look at Jimin. Or both really. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've had this folder for a while but I'm happy I get to share it here. Jimin holds a very special place in my heart and giving others the chance to see all his sides through my eyes always makes me very happy. 

**I hope you enjoy **",69,178

Ok, so, this has been a thing that I couldn't shake off my head for a while no matter how much I tried.

Let's talk about the production standards in bts releases.

A few months ago, I found a fan trying to justify the kpop mass-buying culture and went as far as tying it to their music. Can't remember exact words, but something along the lines of,

'If they don't have enough money, we don't get good music. Their tracks weren't polished well before, and even now people say their sound quality is nowhere near the big three.'

I saw a similar critique in one of the Her r/kpop threads, saying something like how, with all the profits big hit is gaining, they might as well invest in better equipment, because their production values is really lacking. Then he talked about how good the big three do things, talking specifically about YG.

In addition to some other comments in similar regards I can't remember now.

***

So, I think it's a good idea to discuss this, whatever people's opinions are.

* What do you think about the production quality in bts tracks?

* Without bashing or harsh comparisons, do you think it's lacking in respect to big three standards as some people claim? If yes, then how?

* If you're a long time kpop fan, does the quality of their releases feel any different than your average kpop group, and if it does, how does it?

Professional insight is more than welcome.",60,32
736,2017-10-30,2017,10,30,10,79kpen,What are BTS lyrics (mixtapes excluded) wherein you felt the members bared their souls &amp; memories?,daleesai,1509327671,"I was just talking to a K-Army I befriended and she switched to stanning BTS after her bias group disbanded sometime back. One thing she noted was how she sometimes felt uncomfortable, yet also drawn with BTS lyrics because they share so much about their lives in the lyrics of their songs. She always told me [Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBgL81okXtg) was pretty detailed in describing Suga and Namjoon's fights (very physical) that she was taken aback how an idol group who are meant to sell group unity can comfortably talk about their discord in such way and immortalized it in lyrics, even if it happened in the past. 

She was also surprised when Young Forever was released because of how self-aware the boys feel about their popularity and success. She told me idols are meant to dissipate any worry for their fans, but Young Forever talks about what happens when their time is up.

We brought up this discussion because she was really left shook by Sea and Outro: Her (""deep inside we know those truths...but did they really have to make songs about it"" was what she told me) because those lyrics are extremely rare for any idols. She told me the fan in her was flabbergasted by the lyrics but the person in her got more invested in them because it made her feel as if they trusted her enough to share such thoughts. She said there are a lot of self-composing/self-producing idols now but Bangtan lyrics can get too honest about their personal lives. She said she understood mixtapes/solos but she was shocked even the mini albums which had the typical fanservice photocards and photobooks has such lyrics too.

For you, what are BTS songs aside from the mixtapes (which were meant to be personal and soul-baring anyways) where you felt the lyrics were just so raw and anecdotal?",21,69

I know that Bts is a kpop group,  and that means they're going to have fanservice,  but  the way they act just seems so natural to me that its hard to imagine it being entirely calculated. I also wonder whether cultural differences are making me see things that aren't there,  because I know that in Korea its much more socially acceptable for men to be physically affectionate with each other. What do you guys think?  How natural do you think their ""fanservice"" is? And is the way they act typical of Korean male friendships?",97,57

Jin - Snowboarding! Would love to hit the slopes with this goofball and I could teach him English Dad Jokes while riding the chairlift together.

J-hope and Jimin - Dancing lessons - probably an obvious choice. But I try so hard to learn their choreography and to have a couple hours in the studio with them would be a freaking dream. I'd have them teach me BST so I could see their sexy moves up close. _ 

RM - A long walk where we could talk about books and life and have a stimulating intellectual discussion.

V - Shopping! That boy could probably make me look 20 years younger by picking out cool clothes for me lol.

Jungkook - Sit at a table and he could teach me to draw while I help him with his English. I'd probably want to give him the most mom advice too. He's still so young...

Suga - Sitting in his studio and watching him compose music - I'd of course wish I was fluent in Korean so we could also have some deep conversations about life struggles.",47,18
