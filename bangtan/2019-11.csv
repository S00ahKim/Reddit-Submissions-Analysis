You know how the boys always say things like they wish they could watch us and know our faces/lives/how we think etc? The same way that we get to know them through their songs/interviews/V lives etc... What if we did a project where we made our own vlogs for them to watch and created our own kind of channel with a new episode coming out at a certain time? Say each week or so there was a new episode made of 3 new 10 minute vlogs sent in showing a different Army going about their lives and presenting themselves as an individual. Not as reactions or responses to the boys but about us and who we are on a personal level. They could be in any language with subtitles and if we worked on it together we could make it a big worldwide project where we get to know each other and the boys get to know us on a more intimate level. Our fears, our dreams, our routines, our hobbies, our views. Anyone and everyone could be included and it would truly represent the diversity of our little universe which is BTS and ARMY. One single channel on YouTube which Army's run with an email where you send in your own edited vlog and then they get released weekly. It just popped into my head and I've never heard of anything like it but wouldn't that be the best present we could gift them? It was just a thought but I wanted to know what you guys thought about it and if you think it is something I should actually try to make happen and, if you do, what the best ways of spreading the message would be to all types of people so that I could get it going properly??

35,2019-11-2,2019,11,2,4,dq98a9,Thoughts on BTS and K-pop scandals,88sdjj,1572637290,"I guess I just wanted to gather the thoughts that have been on my mind for the past few days and hear yours.

This year has seen quite a lot of scandals within kpop and as a Western fan who has only been part of a kpop fandom (this one) for 2 years, I realized I'm still getting used to the way things are handled and the standards idols are being held to. Especially the latest scandal that led to Wonho leaving Monsta X really struck something with me, even though I'm only a casual Monsta X listener. 

I really started thinking about how even rumors about things that wouldn't matter that much in Western culture could be career damaging or even career ending in Korea. I knew that before, of course, but recent things really had me thinking. If you look at Wonho's situation, it seems it was all started by one person who accused him of something without providing proof and it spiralled into him leaving the group. In his case I would think there's some truth to the stories, since he was very quick to leave and more stories keep coming out, but even then the stories, to me, aren't damaging enough to justify ending his career. I realize that's my Western view on things and that idol culture and Korean culture is very different and I can either accept that or I should step away from kpop altogether, but it has really opened my eyes again to how vulnerable kpop idols really are. Any individual could target an idol and do some real damage by simply spreading rumors or bringing up a thing from the past. They are so much more vulnerable than Western artists who on top of being less vulnerable to these things are also more easily forgiven and given a second chance by the public. 

I know BTS have had their ""scandals"", the biggest (somewhat recent) one that comes to my mind was last year's controversy surrounding the shirt Jimin wore, but I feel in general BTS has a pretty clean image and reputation (correct me if I'm wrong). And I'm actually surprised by that, considering how they've been around for quite some time now and how high profile they are and therefore perhaps an easy ""target"". It actually made me a little anxious to see things unfold with other groups  lately and how things from the past or even simple rumors can catch up with an idol so quickly and suddenly, and have serious consequences.

I guess I've just been thinking a lot these past few days about how at any point some news or rumors could come out about how a member of BTS did something, that from my Western point of view would not be that big of a deal, but could literally damage or even end their career. I'm not saying I'm expecting BTS members to do anything ""wrong"" (whatever that means), but I also realize nobody is perfect. I was just wondering if others have been thinking about this and if others ever ""worry"" (that might be too strong of a word) about the future of BTS in that way and the things that could come their way, since to me (from my Western POV), it feels like they could lose it all in a heartbeat and a lot faster than your average Western artist who can honestly get away with a lot of crap. Just all thoughts on this in general are welcome and appreciated. Thanks for reading!",143,98

I am a huge fan of all the storytelling BTS has on their MVs, the hidden messages, their outfit choices, their stages for the concerts, award performances, their message,... 

I also love how they don't really wear matchy-matchy outfits and that they seem to be pretty ""scriptless"" for their behaviour for awards shows and interviews (chaotic BTS is the best!) - obviously they haven been trained and they have guidelines to follow but they seem a bit more... True to themselves?

Anyway, is all this really different  to what other K-pop groups do? EXO, Blackpink, SuperM, Twice,... You follow me. Is their stage presence really that different? Is their behaviour really that different? How?

I have seen some of other groups MVs and I can see a lack of story or at least, they are different when it comes into engaging with their fans.
I have also read few interviews of other K-pop groups praising BTSs concerts and award show performances.

Not sure if this is because I am being too bias and I am blindsided or if there is truly a difference between our boys and other groups. Thoughts?",141,41

Please do research before buying signed albums, do not ask me questions where I got my albums; they are all from korea and usually signed albums are given away to acquiantances or connections or event then sold later online such as ebay listings (ex of legit signed album seller is mojasajo). I check pen pressure, consistency of members' signs for the era, references to other legit signed albums, presence of not for sale or  (there are legit c1 copies and albums without komca sticker also) etc. I am an avid collector of BTS goods, I own signed albums as well and have other fellow signed album collectors check the albums before I put them up for sale.",1,9

I had come across it on this sub (type Hyunye in the subreddit search bar) nearly 7 months ago.

The original subreddit post made by u/austen1996 : [https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/ba1v79/190406\_artistpainter\_hyunye\_shares\_photos\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/ba1v79/190406_artistpainter_hyunye_shares_photos_of/) 

The Instagram post: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv5xHgqASvf/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv5xHgqASvf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)  (please remember to not spam, bombard or harass the artist)

Reiterating what I said about it in my old comment a few months back:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/cjaq1v/what\_visual\_styleconceptsimagery\_would\_you\_be/evckq3w/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/cjaq1v/what_visual_styleconceptsimagery_would_you_be/evckq3w/?context=3) 

This commissioned piece wasn't in Boy with Luv or any stage appearance of it, neither was it for Lights. In the time that has since passed I haven't seen it used anywhere during the tour including the Seoul finale. Also it wasn't even for theo Chicken Noodle Soup MV.

This makes me think of  the following possibiities:

1) It was designed for use &amp; wear in his **private time** in which case let's all pretend it doesn't exist and go back to minding our own business!!  

2) It's for the **End of Year award stages** (Dionysus specifically)

3) It's for the **rumoured Japanese comeback** this year

***OR***

4)  We might just be staring at a **possible hint** of a direction for the fashion sense/dressing style for the title song/MV for MOTS: Shadow! 

Given how much detail and effort is put into designing every little detail of their MVs from scratch and very very much in advance and that BTS have in the past (as well as today's Crown of Thorns discovery) asked for customised elements such as jewellery for MVs such as Boy with Luv etc.

This is again a very long shot but I thought I should mention it. What do you guys think?",4,21

I'm not a huge fan of BTS, I don't actively listen to their music and I don't actively follow them. However, my SO does and I've learned so much about this fandom from her and have come to appreciate it more than I thought I would. 

At first all I really knew about them was that they make music and a lot of interaction with their fans. Honestly before meeting this girl I found them quite cringy and couldn't stand it all. But when I met this girl she started sending me their songs and showing me the fanbase and she did all that very proudly. 

Recently I've learned so much just about how much some of you care about BTS. Not as a brand but as people. If one of them feel down on one of the livestreams you can find loads of people talking about how they want that person to feel better and give them good wishes. I bet this happens to other musicians too but it still impresses me. 

I honestly don't think I've ever seen such a loving community of fans. Thanks all of you for being amazing!

BTS and I really admired the cameramen who were tasked to film them in the corners of the escape rooms they were at for an hour, just watching it all go down as Bangtan tried to solve the puzzles and riddles haha. Holding up the camera for an hour must be so tiring!

I also felt sympathy for the cameraman assigned to JK when they were doing the Hangul Run! episode haha. 

Another one is the Zombie Run! episode where Hobi screeched because the thought the cameraman was a zombie when he was just trying to catch up with him and Jimin, hahaha.

I don't have a lot of BTS merch and I think one of the main reasons is I'm not sure what I'd do with a lot of it once it arrives or the best way to display it. I recently got the Bring the Soul free photo card gift (which is my first set of photo cards) and while I was really excited to receive it, after opening it they've pretty much sat on my desk because I'm not sure what to do with them now. 

With the Seasons greetings package coming up for preorder soon, I'm tossing up whether or not I should purchase it and if I do, how would I display the different parts of the package. So I thought I'd post here and ask how others display their merch and photo cards. Do you have a shrine? Rotate different items quarterly? etc etc. Please let me know and feel free to share images if you're particularly proud of your set up.",2,2

We asked for your input regarding fanart [in an earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/dka1hd/191019_rbangtan_state_of_the_subreddit_fanart/), and after some great suggestions, [we asked for your input again in a follow-up post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/do3sfd/191027_fanart_rule_update_followup_post_new_mods/). 

Based on this round of community feedback, we have made the following changes to the rules.

#New fanart rules

New rule added under [D. Submission Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_d._submission_rules):


&gt;D1. Fanart: The place to submit fanart is our sister subreddit, /r/heungtan. All fanart submitted on /r/bangtan will be removed and asked to submit to /r/heungtan instead. Make sure to abide by /r/heungtans rules when submitting. You can also submit in the bi-weekly /r/bangtan rooms if you wish.


Section F. Fanart Submission Guidelines has been removed. We will not be making any exceptions to the rules, as it would add too much grey area. You can view the rules page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules).  

*****

As described in the previous post, we will also begin doing **a weekly round-up post**. This post will include the main news, releases and other official BTS content from the past week, but also a section for fan content that is posted on /r/heungtan to bring more visibility for submissions from our sister subreddit. The exact format of the round-up post will most likely be honed over time.


We appreciate your feedback and read all of your comments and suggestions carefully. Thank you to everyone who left a comment in previous community posts! We were really encouraged by all the ideas and suggestions, and think this is a great option to try. If it doesnt turn out like were expecting, or doesnt seem like the best course after all, we can always discuss again after weve given it a fair shake. 

If you have any further questions, please comment below or send us modmail!",47,143

229,2019-11-7,2019,11,7,12,dsrirl,Kid getting picked on for liking BTS. Thoughts?,aymaraymar,1573096625,"Hello, this is my first time ever posting on Reddit. Please forgive me for any mistakes. 

So I want some thoughts from fellow ARMYs on this incident- 

My step daughter (14years old) is a huge BTS fan and so is her father and myself. On Monday, she came home from school saying she had a bad day. So what happened was, apparently some kids in her science class found out about JKs car accident and since she is very loud and proud about being ARMY, they decided to give her a hard time for it. They teased her for him getting into a car accident and then threw in some racist remarks about her liking Japanese boys. 

So I took this as a teaching moment and first let her discuss how she felt about the incident, how she reacted to the other kids while they were picking on her and what she can learn from this. 

I told her that people can judge someone because they are ignorant and not willing to broaden their perspective of the world. We talked about racism in todays society and how to deal with liking something that others might not know about or understand. I also talked to her about the message that BTS has worked so hard to spread, one about speaking yourself or standing up for yourself and about loving yourself no matter what others say or do. We talked about ways to stand up to mean kids and to not let other peoples opinions change how you feel about something, especially feelings about your own self worth. 

Do you guys have anything to add or share? I want to let her know that she isnt the only person who has been through something like this and hear about how others have dealt with a similar situation. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post!",62,251

I am quite new to BTS, I have always kind of liked them but never got too into them as men of my age (early 20s) aren't exactly the target audience haha. 

There's something about K-pop that is extremely enjoyable though, and BTS are the best at it. The catchy pop beats, cool dance moves and smooth vocals - it's no wonder they are currently the biggest band on the planet - it is pure entertainment, and I finally allowed myself to start listening to more of their songs. Thank God I did because now I'm a huge fan! 

Spring Day really stood out to me when I heard it for whatever reason. Sometimes a song just connects with you in a way that you can't really explain, which is what makes music so powerful. 

After having a really tough week at work and feeling quite down, this song has helped me pick myself up again and feel better. So even though BTS will never see this, I am truly thankful as they helped me feel better through a torrid time! 

So yeah, nobody has probably read this waffle. But thanks a lot to you all, I'm glad to be a part of the ARMY now.",1,1

Ive been an ARMY since 2014 and BTS has gotten me through a lot. I was wondering if people could help me jog my memory of some of their thought provoking lyrics. 

To start off, some of my faves are: 

Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest - Tomorrow

331,2019-11-10,2019,11,10,14,du7jin,Creating a BTS-inspired backstory for my D&amp;D character,Rhyethil,1573364524,"So I got myself into my first D&amp;D campaign a few weeks ago and we just had our first session. My character is a tiefling College of Swords bard who's heavily influenced by J-Hope in terms of personality, backstory and flavour during combat. I don't have much of a backstory for Hoshi (the table decided on this as my PC's nickname, also known as The Ho  ) beyond the main premise:

A young man from the faraway continent of Kara-Tur (either from the Shou Lung or Koryo Empire) who was inspired to join a performing arts company, the Eminent Jade Wind Ensemble when he witnessed them perform in his town. Under the guidance of the company and its head, the Sublime Matron (the title is a WIP but I want this character to be based off the League of Legends champion Sona), he learns the art of rhythm and dance and understanding the craft on a personal, almost spiritual level. He's determined to use his skills to evoke awe, hope and joy to all who see him, just like how he felt the first day he laid eyes on the other performers.

Along the way, he befriends six other members and they form a troupe of their own. I've settled on the name ""The Seraphs of Blossoming Youth,"" after the transliteration of HYYH's Chinese characters. They perform really well and love and treat each other like inseparable brothers, but Hoshi decides to run away from the group indefinitely because he feels like he's not good enough to perform with them and has is ashamed to be weighing them down. He travels to the neighboring continent of Faerun to expand his horizons and master his craft before returning to his brothers.

From here, this is where my PC lands himself into Waterdeep and the start of our campaign. So I'm trying to flesh out his universe, including the people, places and the company's structure. I'd like ARMY's thoughts on it. My first order of business is figuring out what kind of races would be best-related to the other real-life members. Here's what I got so far:

1. Kim Namjoon = Bronze Dragonborn (Bronze dragons are his distant cousins you can't convince me otherwise)
2. Kim Seokjin = Eladrin (has been casting Charm Person and Suggestion on others for funsies)
3. Min Yoongi = Tiger Tabaxi (I *could not* pass this up, also ""Was born a tiger, ain't ever gonna live like a dog"")
4. Park Jimin = Drow or Half-Drow (Tiefling was already taken, but I still want this PC to be flirtatious/charismatic)
5. Kim Taehyung = Changeling (inspired by his Singularity masks, loyal to his dog first, then his group second)
6. Jung Jungkook = Human (I'm actually sad to realize that this PC has the shortest lifespan among the troupe )

What do you think? I eventually want to give each character their own appearances, personalities and backstories once I've figured out how the Ensemble operates (I'm using parts of a tree for reference. Members are called blooms, troupes are called fruits. The performers are part of the Crown, the administration is the Trunk, and the labour (heavy lifting, travelling, animal care, trade, etc.) are the Roots). For example, Jimin's character escaped drow society but his secret insecurities remain, or Jin's character pops in and out of the Feywild for days or weeks but somehow never misses a performance. Give me suggestions and I'll try to craft something to hand to my DM.

Should they get their own classes? What's a better title for the ""Sublime Matron""? What are some people/details/ideas that can better flesh out the story? I wanna know your thoughts.",0,1

347,2019-11-11,2019,11,11,12,dumg79,2019 Adopt a Stan Sign Up &amp; FAQ,BTSprojects,1573442834,"Hello r/bangtan[!](https://i.imgur.com/UhkW5zq.jpg)

&amp;nbsp;

It is that holiday time of year to spread lots of Holiday cheer!

&amp;nbsp;

We know the holidays tend to be hard on the wallet and we have been working diligently to plan projects that anyone can participate in  which is why are happy to announce that we are continuing tradition of Adopt a Stan. 

&amp;nbsp;

Adopt a Stan was started by our very own u/Erinzilla83 in order to spread some holiday and Bangtan cheer to those who are on a tight budget and are unable to participate in the other holiday exchanges that are happening. u/Erinzilla83 covers the cost of this project herself and has been buying fun gifts for stans all year!^(if any of you are curious, Erin has spent ~$300 on goodies)

&amp;nbsp;

While we dont want to tell you the exact contents of the items you could receive, we do want you to have an idea so you can skip participating if these items are not something that interests you. Most of the items are small and easy to mail in order to keep shipping as low as possible. Some of the items you could receive include fanart, stickers, PCs, and assortment of other small items. All assortments will be random, but Erin will do her best to tailor the items to your bias. 

&amp;nbsp;

So now that you have some background on what Adopt a Stan (AaS) is  here is how you can participate:

&amp;nbsp;

# To participate in Adopt a Stan:
1. You CANNOT be signed up for the Secret Santa gift exchange or postcard exchange. 
2. You MUST BE located in the US. 
3. If you received an AaS gift last year, we ask that you please give new r/bangtan members a chance to participate. You are on your honor.

&amp;nbsp;

[ADOPT A STAN REGISTRATION FORM](https://forms.gle/c4GChJGDFAVSvP6c7)

&amp;nbsp;
*Adopt A Stan will only be open to the FIRST 20 people who fill out the form*

&amp;nbsp;

# To participate in International Adopt a Stan:
1. You CANNOT be signed up for the Secret Santa gift exchange or postcard exchange. 
2. You must be located OUTSIDE THE US.
3. If you received an AaS gift last year, we ask that you please give new r/bangtan members a chance to participate. You are on your honor.

&amp;nbsp;

[INTERNATIONAL ADOPT A STAN REGISTRATION FORM](https://forms.gle/zjdy9u1CAyYsx1LG7)

&amp;nbsp;
*Adopt A Stan will only be open to the FIRST 10 people who fill out the form*

&amp;nbsp; 

# FAQ

**HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE BEEN SELECTED?**

The form will be open until ALL slots have been filled for both Domestic and International Stans. Once we have hit the slot limit we will close the form and email the individuals that have been selected. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**DONATIONS**

There are two ways to donate. For those of you who may be interested in donating a gift to a stan, make sure to indicate so in the last question of the Secret Santa registration form; it's the very last question in the 4th section (*Before you go, would you like to donate a gift to the Adopt a Stan project?*). If you already filled out the Secret Santa Sign-Up form, but would like to amend your answer to this question, please PM the Projects Team so we can coordinate with you. 

&amp;nbsp;

For those of you who may be interested in donating monetarily to help cover packaging, shipping costs or even the purchase of extra goodies  you can donate to the Erin's PayPal [HERE](https://www.paypal.me/ErinBrown83). If you have any questions about donations feel free to comment below or drop us a message.

349,2019-11-11,2019,11,11,12,dumkj6,r/bangtan Secret Santa 2019!,BTSprojects,1573443405,"Hey everyone!

Its already November, which means its time for **The 3rd Annual r/bangtan Secret Santa!!** The only requirements to participate are [1] be a member of this subreddit, and [2] have some [holiday cheer](https://imgur.com/99RBMEN). We hope you can join us in spreading some BTS love around the globe!

&amp;nbsp;

Like last year, the Projects Team will be hosting TWO Secret Santa exchanges: a Gift Exchange and a Postcard Exchange!

# I. GIFT EXCHANGE

- For subscribers who want to send and receive gift packages
- Sign up to the price-range bracket that best fits your budget
- Secret Santa can be matched internationally or within your own country (your choice)
- Yes, you can join both GIFT EXCHANGE and POSTCARD EXCHANGE

&amp;nbsp;

# II. POSTCARD EXCHANGE

- A low-cost alternative for those who want to join the festivities!
- Secret Santa is matched internationally
- Yes, you can join both GIFT EXCHANGE and POSTCARD EXCHANGE

&amp;nbsp;

# III. How does this work?

We'll be opening two registration forms -- one for the Gift Exchange and one for the Postcard Exchange. If you want to join both exchanges, simply fill out both forms. After the matches have been made, we'll be sending out emails with the details of your match. There will be checkpoints for the gifts and postcards, as well as deadlines for proof of shipping the gifts and mailing the postcards. We will also be using the dedicated Secret Santa subreddit from previous years, along with [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/rbangtan_army/) to send out reminders and updates.

- Note that **if you are below 18 years old, ask permission from your parent or guardian before joining any of the Secret Santa Exchanges.**

&amp;nbsp;

The Projects Team needs you to be 10000% committed to joining this exchange before signing up. We understand that life happens, and that some events are beyond our control; while we will try to be as accommodating as possible, we ask that everybody please do their part and adhere to the rules and deadlines. We do have backup plans in case we encounter a few hiccups, but of course we'd prefer that everything goes smoothly. **That being said, though, please also acknowledge these risks, and keep them in mind when deciding to participate.**

&amp;nbsp;

# IV. How do I join?

### GIFT EXCHANGE: [Sign up here](https://forms.gle/SMXxNca6eChobwsd8)!

### POSTCARD EXCHANGE: [Sign up here](https://forms.gle/H8THknh1nxzMPA3ZA)!

**Deadline for both forms is on November 16, Saturday, 11:59PM US CST.**

&amp;nbsp;

# V. Projected Timeline
- Expect to receive your Secret Santa Match details through email on or before November 23rd.
- December 4 - Send in your Proof of Gift/Postcard to receive your Match's shipping address
- December 15 - Send in your Proof of Shipping

&amp;nbsp;

# VI. Other Announcements

* PCAs
* Soribada
* AAA
* Youtube awards of any variety
* Shorty awards

Any more out there?

Also, I'd really like to thank Western media for making sure some of us never stop with our support for the OG underdogs, BTS even though their achievements should have meant they are no longer underdogs.",84,1

358,2019-11-11,2019,11,11,23,dusri6,do you think bts still have a chance to be taken seriously in the west?,chicken_sandwichh,1573480862,"not sure if this type of post is allowed. but after the pca happened and since the grammys is just around the corner. might as well open the discussions about it.

i get it, bts isa boy band and boy bands aren't generally favored becauseany male musicalact who has an audiencethatis predominantly females isn't reallytaken seriously. not to add that they are ASIAN males which men don't really think are ""men""enough for them to give them a listen even once. also the xenophobia because they sing in korean.

but for making it this far and be able tosell asl much as bts does andfillstadiums around the globe and have the influence bts has despiteof all of the things i listed above should be acknowledged. 

i've seen how hard fans and fanbases had to work for someradios to play bts in 2 in the morning. while it got a tiny bit better in 2018, ijust thought people just need to warm up to the boys and their sales, while impressive need to be at the top in 2019. and they need to do something only top western artists get to do, which is the stadium tour. but here we are...

i know the phrase ""bts paved the way"" gets a bad rep but really, for a group of people who didn't shut the door once they opened it and got inside, they left it wide open for others to follow them but still, theyare treated like they aren't pulling the same numbers as these huge ass western artists.

so frustrating because this is 2016-2017korean industryall over again.",144,1

1. We may have nomination on the group/duo or best pop vocal. Leave the top tier away. 
2. MOS:P is a weaker album compared to last year (review on Pitchforks and other sites).
3. BTS has no label records connection to do the campaign and some loophole for the voting. I thought Columbia is BTS record label but turn out they do not.
In the wake of PCAs, I am think about the scenario when we don't get any nomination and other group get. Consider how Interscope influence strong enough to make PCAs give the award today. What will it happen again for Grammy as they also have a race and gender card? Are we too loud relating to Grammy award while its up to now, still an unknown question!",50,1

I guess what I'm saying is that one of the biggest life lessons I've taken away from being ARMY is that the best revenge is living your best life. 

I hope this makes sense, I had a bad day today so I was blasting Ddaeng on the way home and it got me to thinking how much positive impact and influence the guys have had on not only my life but how I cope when things aren't going right.",1,1

Before I talk about our current campaign, I come bearing results for a few months of campaigns (bit of a lag waiting for some information from the organizations)! 

Firstly, from the Jungkook birthday campaign, over $5300 was raised to provide wellness services for over 40 survivors of trafficking and violence through the Helen Bamber foundation!! That's over 40 people whose are now on the path to recovery and reclaiming a more normal life because of you ARMY!! Full report thread [here](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1186817114277076995)

For Namjoon's birthday campaign, almost $8000 was raised to build a school out of recycled materials in Guatemala for 52 students!! Construction of the classrooms has already begun and soon those children will have educational opportunities that were not available before. Full thread for that campaign [here](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1187741321664045057)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to the current campaign! This month, our campaign is #PAZAPAWithARMY. We are working with PAZAPA, an organization in Haiti that supports the treatment, education, development, and inclusion of children with disabilities there as well as supporting their families. Just about 5% of the children with disabilities in Haiti have access to specialized medical center and inclusive education and PAZAPA is working to change that!

&gt;What made you fall \[in love\] with BTS? What was the exact moment you realized this was so much more for you than just a favorite artist? Does your love for BTS feel different \[from different groups you also like\]? Why?

The piano music playing in the beginning is Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy

# Dope

When the boys are dancing together during the second chorus, there are banners with German writing on the wall behind them. The red one says "" Keine Profite mit der Miete,"" meaning ""no profit with rent,"" and the white one says  Friede den Htten! Krieg den Palsten! meaning ""peace in the huts, war in the palaces. [Here is a link to a German Army's explanation of these phrases.](https://aminoapps.com/c/btsarmy/page/blog/dope-mv-the-story-behind-the-german-slogans/o3RZ_73wSdu7XBw2anVZ45k0j0jLgvj3gkB)

# Fire

\-The scene where Suga shakes hands with a hooded man is a reference to the album cover of Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. [https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0ofUWYXL.\_SY355\_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0ofUWYXL._SY355_.jpg)

\-The scene where Jungkook sits on a trash can and watches a burning bike roll past is a reference to the movie Lost River. You can also see the words Lost River spray painted on the door on the left.

\-This might be a stretch but I think the scene where they iron Jin is a reference to the lyrics of Save Me, ""Thank you... for ironing me who was wrinkled.""

# Spring Day

\-The train is a reference to the movie *Snowpiercer*. RM's rap in the beginning also mentions the Snowpiercer.

\-The motel that is shown is called Omelas. This is a reference to the short story *The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas* by Ursula le Guin. 

# Serendipity

It's not confirmed, but some people think this music video is based on ""The Little Prince"" by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 

# Blood Sweat and Tears

\-The entire music video is based off of the book *Demian* by Herman Hesse. It contains a lot of imagery and themes from the book, and the quote that RM reads during the cut scene is also from *Demian*.

\-The music that plays at the beginning is ""Kyrie,"" from Mass in B Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.

\-The statue with no arms is Venus de Milo, and the black statue is Perseus with the Head of Medusa by Benvenuto Cellini. 

\-The painting that Jin stares at is *Fall of the Rebel Angels* by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

\-When V is sitting on a balcony and appears to jump into a painting, the painting is *Landscape with the Fall of Icarus*, also by Bruegel the Elder. It's very hard to notice, but this painting is also in the blue/purple room with the fallen chandeliers where the whole group is in the beginning. It's hanging on the right wall. (You can see it a bit more clearly when Jungkook is floating in the same room at 3:44).

\-Both Breugel paintings are in the BS&amp;T Japanese's music video too.

\-On the side of the floor when transitioning from RM's room to Jimin and Suga's room (pause the video at 3:13), there is a label that says Chatroom 2,3 . This is a reference to the movie *Chatroom,* but I'm not sure about the 2,3 then up arrow. The room that Suga and Jimin are in, with the glass squares on the floor and a door behind them, is also similar to a scene from *Chatroom.* [*https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzVt82RU5elq\_WnDpw0xlDuCdo3GVz85w0\_vCTAVlTW5lECA2Ny44YOWY6UJ2Ui4mC\_av8kRxjdORWMNGbErS4PZUX0FwfrKMw=w1600-rw*](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzVt82RU5elq_WnDpw0xlDuCdo3GVz85w0_vCTAVlTW5lECA2Ny44YOWY6UJ2Ui4mC_av8kRxjdORWMNGbErS4PZUX0FwfrKMw=w1600-rw)

\-The statue in the background of J-Hope's solo scenes is the Pieta by Michelangelo. 

\-The song that Suga plays on the organ is *Passacaglia in D Minor* by Dietrich Buxtehude. In Demian, there is a character that plays the organ and is specifically mentioned playing Buxtehude.

\-As Jin goes to kiss the statue, on the wall there is mirror and above it the words Man muss noch Chaos in sich haben, um einen tanzenden Stern gebren zu knnen. (You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.) This is a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, who is also mentioned in Demian.

\-The statue that Jin kisses is Abraxos from Demian.

# Unknown Artworks from BS&amp;T

 If anybody could help me with these I'd be very grateful. 

\-All the statues/photos of statues, save Venus and Perseus, in the very beginning ""museum"" scene. 

\-In the next scene, where they sit on the coach, there is a painting on the ceiling (more easily seen at 3:43), a painting behind them (also at 3:43), a painting propped up on the floor next to Jin (more easily seen at 2:17), and a painting of a horse that's slightly visible behind the left curtain. The painting on the ceiling is also in the Japanese music video when J-hope and Jimin are dancing (It's not a Bruegel tho, I checked).

\-In Namjoon's room with the antlers, there are some books on the mantle. Also there's a desk with a painting of what I think is a Madonna and Child, but there are so many Madonna and Childs in the world that I can't tell which. There's more paintings on the walls and two photos statues on the floor as well.",34,1

I just love HIM so much. Whenever they post twitter pictures I want to know where they are, so I will analyze surroundings or small bus stops and signs and find it on google earth and document it. Most of my storage is BTS photos, which I know many ARMY have, but I have OVER 20,000. I have not yet seen another one who had 20,000+ photos of JUST bts. Then, I get so jealous if anybody is near him. I love him so much. I love the other members too, but he is special! I found out which hotels they stay, too. Lately, I've been keeping a journal section on my notes app where I just fantasize and write about him. I wish I was kidding. I am 100% serious, this is not a troll post (I feel like people will see it this way) I've tried taking a break but I can't stop. He is my life. I have terrible grades because I'm always writing, saving pictures, or watching V-LIVE. I always spam their twitter, Weverse, and V-LIVE too. It payed off though, because I've been noticed twice, Once during a V-LIVE, and once at a concert because BigHit's cameraman ran around the venue with a camera and went up to me. Fun memories. But now they're dangerous memories that are slowly killing me. I don't know what to do anymore. My whole life revolves around them and I can't spend a minute not thinking about him.

I'm sorry if this is weird, I don't even know how to socialize anymore hahaha. I can't see a psychologist for personal reasons that I am uncomfortable sharing. Sorry if this post is weird and unfit for here",1,1

The thing is I'm currently extremely busy and all their lyrics would overwhelm me to find a good one.

In this game, I've backmasked 10 BTS songs and set them all at 1.25x speed.   

The parts I've backmasked for each song are the **first chorus** and the **verse after the chorus.**   

So in the audio files, you'll here the post-chorus verse first since it's backmasked (essentially reversed), and then the chorus. If you want to skip directly to the chorus, you can go to the 00:20 mark or thereabouts, usually that's when the chorus starts in the tracks.  :) 

# HOW TO ANSWER:   

Please comment your answers here on this post. Comments have been disabled on the YouTube videos themselves to prevent any confusion as to where to answer.  \^\_\^ 

For the sake of organization and a little fun, we'll put an answer format to avoid any confusion. ^((Just like in the Run! ep. :D ))   

To answer, comment your bias' name (or OT7 if you don't have one), and then state the number of the song as indicated in the video title first, and then the answer. You can choose to answer all 10 songs chronologically, or just some specific tracks.  :) 

**Example answer formats:**

""Kim Namjoon! 

1. Euphoria

2. Trivia: Seesaw

3. Trivia: Love"" and so on. 

***or***

""OT7!   

6. I Know  

9. 4 O'Clock""   

**HINT:** All 10 songs are OT7 songs in their original versions. I did NOT include any solo songs, sub-unit songs, vocal line-only songs, or rap line-only songs. There are NO remixes or Japanese versions of songs.   

This challenge is best done using ear/headphones! Try to listen for the instrumental parts of the song to guess which is which. :) 

**IMPORTANT:** 

Make sure to lower your volume first before playing the song, as it may play loudly even if your settings are set at normal volume. (Something in the Audacity software made the volume louder than usual while editing, I apologize!)

# CLICK THE NUMBERS BELOW TO BE LED TO THE SONG'S YOUTUBE LINKS. :) 

**Again, please set your volume to lower than usual, as the audio file may be a little loud even at your normal settings.**

Guys, she had an astoundingly hard time believing me. She kept shaking her head like ""no, no, must be another group, are you sure, BTS??"".

It just made me realize how far things have come. Nowadays people hear BTS break a world record and the general reaction is ""pft of course"" while NOT EVEN 2 YEARS AGO when they won a DAESANG your average kpop fan was downplaying it.

I love award shows, especially when people/shows I like are nominated, and I always try to watch them as soon as possible to avoid spoilers.

Which brings me to my main question: is there a ""spoiler policy"" at all on this sub during award season or should I stay off it until I can actually watch the shows?

I'm also curious to know if there are actually legal ways to watch the shows outside SK, or if we'll have to *coughcough* find some other ways  Rn I only know that the KBS song festival gets uploaded on YT a couple of days later, but that's not an award show, so I'm at loss,

TIA!",2,1

English isn't my native language but grew up in a Western country and I've consumed enough English media to get general 'impressions' from certain names. Names like Clint, Jim, Jack, John are quite 'masculine' and though sounding names. The kind of names you'd expect any generic male lead to have in an action movie.

Names like Nicolas, Oliver, Johnathan, Marcus etc sound 'posh' or 'rich'. These names might be used for a scholarly or rich person in a movie/tv show

Bernard, Edwin, Julius, Octavius, etc also sound kind of posh but have this old-fashioned undertone that might give them the impression of someone quite snobbish or stuffy.

Similarly Betty and Bruce sound more 'grown up' than Billy and Britney for example.

To me Melody or Mia sounds a bit more 'warm' while Crystal and Tracy sounds a little colder.

Names like Kevin, Michael, Steven, Ashley are very common while Alec, Adelle, Baxter, Casper, Cliff are more uncommon but not to the degree of being considered weird yet. (Once again I'm not an American or native English speaker so I might be off on the commonality of some of these.)

There are of course those names that have specific stereotypes connected to them. Kyle is a POS. Karen is a middle-aged woman who's notoriously difficult. Timmy is a little boy. Herbert is a nerd who doesn't have friends. Harry is a wizard. Mercedes/Candy are strippers. Sarah is basic... etc.

This isn't to say those things are specifically good things or should be encouraged but it is a real phenomenon that different names can subconsciously give us different impressions that is hard to pick up for non-native speakers.

So my question is... does anyone have any insight on some impressions of the boys' names?

From a western perspective, short, clipped names sound more traditionally 'masculine' to me... like Jack, Jim, John, Frank, Bob. Names that end with an O are often perceived as masculine as well while A is usually feminine (this is a very loose rule) like Silvio/Silvia, Leo/Lea, Mario/Maria, Emilio/Emilia, Julio/Julia. While names that end with a Y sound younger/innocent Billy, Timothy , Sammy, Cody, Bobby, Benny, Dany, Robby. Letters like L, N, M, D sound 'softer' than letters like K, R, T, J, Z...

Or anyone just have any impressions on their name? To me Yoongi and Jimin sound a little softer or  cuter. Seokjin and Hoseok sounds sort of firmer/colder. But since I don't speak any Korean this really is just a very shallow interpretations from the sort of sound used in pronouncing the name. I think I read somewhere a long time ago that Jimin is actually a pretty common name(Don't trust this information though because it might be 100 percent wrong). I know that there's a female Park Jimin as well so I'm assuming it's unisex to some degree at least.

I hope this post doesn't break any rules or that people don't take this too seriously.",27,1

I apologize about my English it's not my native language.
I heard that you people like hearing stories about how people fell in love with kpop so here is mine:

I was a hater for a really long time and looked down upon kpop as a whole and especially BTS because for me they were the face of kpop, ergo the embodiment of the thing i hate so i openly laughed at ARMYs. 

It is exactly 10 days since i have decided to give BTS a fair chance and in just 3 days they completely took over my life. 

I started with listening to dna because it had a lot of views so i thought if this is so popular this must be the best they have, and to my (at the time) horror i liked it a lot. I proceeded to listening to every song i came across and found out that i liked every one of them and wanted to slap myself for missing out on all of this just because i was pretentious and decided that kpop was beneath me.

Then i wanted to see who are the people that i enjoy so much? And this was the point of no return. I fell in love with them very quickly, and the more i knew the more i liked them. Soon all of my youtube feed were BTS related videos and i just decided to embrace it fully at this point.

So the moment i gave them a chance they took over my heart and i regret nothing. 

And i am curious, what are your stories?",1,1

That time I want to who are they. Later from UN event, I see they give a speech about ""love yourself"" (right?)  so it made me excited to want to them more! I just go back to YouTube and tried to listen the most viewed BTS music video and listened of all them about 10 songs. It made me want to be a part of fan club. I see on Twitter, they are many tweet that talking about BTS and ARMY. 

So I want to be in Army! But I cannot recognize all member without RM (cuz he speaking English from UN Speech~) I want to know how Redditor be the Army of Them",1,1

However, I just went through the comments section on HKer threads and realise how disgusting these comments are. Instead of asking more people to vote, they tried to put down the group, questions their popularity, racism ,sexism and even judging the fandom. They are literally Hate comments. I know its just voting and how respectful we are to the HK protest, they are putting hate on the band and fandom for no good reason! Fighting for democracy does not mean speeding hate to others!",0,1

644,2019-11-19,2019,11,19,14,dyfy66,How BTS has helped you Mental Health-wise,thehappynoodle,1574140530,"Hi, I'm a baby army. I recently discovered BTS and they have been such a source of joy for me. I wanted to ask how did BTS help you mental-health wise? I read a post from about a year ago about how someone found BTS in the darkest time of their life and how BTS gave them something to look forward to. And it showed them how everyone goes through rough times but it will get better. And it resonated so much with me. I will link that post if it's allowed. That post was more about how BTS affected your life in general, but I want to know more about the mental health perspective. 

So my story is that I have suffered from minor anxiety and depression my whole life, starting from when I was 13. I'm 22 now. But I thought that was normal and it was pretty bearable at the time. I could live life normally to be honest. But I've gone through some rough situations in the past couple years, and a very traumatic ongoing event that left me with PTSD (officially diagnosed by my psychiatrist). And that caused my anxiety and depression to be worse than ever. I was struggling with absolutely nothing bringing me joy and nothing made me feel like my life was worth it. I'm currently in between anti-depressants right now, because the first one I tried did not work for me. And I am going to try another. 

I graduated college recently and have not started to work because my mental health is so poor that some days I can barely get out of bed. And some days I just didn't want to live. But I discovered BTS and I feel like it's slowly bringing back some joy to my life. I have never been into Kpop. I had several friends growing up who were into Big Bang, 2PM, etc. But I was never interested. There is something special about BTS however. 

I went down a rabbit hole, and watched almost all their music videos. I then watched all their interviews and performances on US talk shows, such as Ellen, Stephen Colbert, The Tonight Show, etc. And all the performances and random interviews I could find. Then I started watching all the video compilations on youtube, and holy, there are so many video compilations. I loved how funny they are and how much they truly seem to care for each other, and it seemed genuine instead of fan service. Their videos and compilations always made me laugh and feel happy for a while. 

Also it's surprising how much I connect with them and love them, because men have caused a lot of my trauma, such as in the workplace. And I had a psychotic stalker for over an year. But these boys seem so pure with a happiness for life. 

And even if it seems silly, BTS brought back a tiny bit of joy to my life. It's still a work in progress, but I feel like they have helped me. I love their message and their friendships. I love the music and it brought back some of my love for music. I hadn't listened to music in a long time because I felt like nothing had a point in life. 

Also after I posted my first comment on this sub, another army commented the nicest message back and it meant so much. I would love to hear you guys' stories too if you have one. It doesn't even have to be mental health related, maybe just in general if you haven't had those struggles. Thank you!! 

BTW, I have a 4-way bias if that's a thing. RM and Jin caught my eye first, so of course they are my faves. But I love V and JK now so much. So a 4-way tie. But I do like all 7 of course. And I will link the discussion post I loved if it is allowed!",38,1

Hi everyone! My name is Biju  I am a Brazilian writer, journalist, and ARMY, and have written about BTS before for Noisey ([https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/pa9vjk/bts-concert-review-essay-london](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vjk/bts-concert-review-essay-london)), as well as authoring a column called Into The Kpop World on the same website (the latest piece was looking into how so many emo kids grew up into adults who love Kpop (and BTS)  you can see it here: [https://www.vice.com/en\_in/article/xwneqz/k-pop-emo-fandom-crossover-2019](https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/xwneqz/k-pop-emo-fandom-crossover-2019)). 

I am currently working on an academic article about ARMY and the emotional ways in which we express our fandom beyond borders  looking into the sometimes culturally different but emotionally similar forms in which fans from anywhere in the world show their love for the boys.

Because of that, I am calling for people from all over the world who would be up for being interviewed by me about their experience of being a fan in their country! The interview is not very long and your name can be kept anonymous if you would like.

The final article will be presented at the first Global BTS conference in January, in London.

Please feel free to ask in the comments or PM me if you have any doubts / would like to be interviewed!

Thank you!! ",88,1

Sometimes we get used but its a win-win situation. Like the BBMAS or we trend a show that the boys are performing on. Or mass buy a good magazine cover story. Thats a best case scenario.

Worst case scenarios are. Peoples Choice Awards where they use us for engagement then throw out our votes to hand the award to whoever they want. Or MTV creating a bullshit KPop category so they can get our votes but prevent the boys from competing with the mainstream awards. Or radio stations asking for retweets to play their song but never play it.

Then there is the Grammys. Im on the fence about this one. I mean they clearly wanted to engage the fandom but they cant force Grammy voters to choose BTS. Yet, I still feel used and thrown out somehow.

So how to you think the fandom should handle these situations in the future? I think we should fully acknowledge and OWN our power. But, also, not give it away so easily to people who dont deserve it.

Any ideas? Maybe we could/should take our cues from BTS and Big Hit?

I am posting to see if anyone would be interested in purchasing my **Chimmy BT21 X Kolon official fleece jacket size small.**

So I ordered the jacket and was incredibly excited to get it. But, to my dismay, it was way too big for me.  I only took it out of the packaging put it on for a moment and then immediately wrapped it up and put it back in its packaging. **No tags were removed and its in perfect condition!** 

I wanted to see if anyone here was interested since I really want a fellow ARMY to get it verse someone buying it just to flip it. 

In total I spent **$85.00** (with shipping) on the coat and would at least like to make the majority of that back. So, if you are within the **US shipping will be included** in the $85.00-- if you are outside of the US we will need to discuss shipping fees etc.

So my coworker (who is also my one real-life ARMY friend) and I were talking about how to cope once some of the members have to enlist and made this ridiculous promise to each other that if we're both still at our current jobs by the time Jin enlists, we'll enlist ourselves in the US Army.

And that certain celebrity that Jin reminded me of was Keanu Reeves!

It was from the introverted personality, the public likability, strangely youthful complexion, and altruistic attitude that brought me to this connection. Albeit, Jin is a lot more eccentric and dorky than Keanu, but the commonality between them still stands. A case that strikes me the most between the two is when Keanu gave up his seat for a lady in the subway even though he was there first, and with Jin when he accompanied Hwang Chi-Yeol who was alone and feeling awkward. As a little extra tidbit, the two are great with strangers with Jin befriending a friendly bar owner in Malta whilst Keanu entertained a group of strangers after a flight was canceled.

Now the only person that I could think of is Jin and Keanu, so this leaves the other members seemingly open. Who do you guys think BTS' western equivalents are?",59,1

Right off the bat many K-pop fans were uneasy about this - American media just doesn't have the best track record when it comes to respectfully covering K-pop (let alone anything foreign, really), and people are anticipating that the film will be full of xenophobia, cheap shots taken at Korean culture, and other crude forms of mockery.

Well... an ARMY working in the industry [managed to obtain a copy of the script](https://twitter.com/AnnieLuvsBTS1/status/1197677740779945984), and believe it or not - it is just as bad, if not worse, than people imagined. And yes, there are mentions of real groups in the draft, including BTS.

First of all, the whole thing is permeated with racism of the lowest brow. There are several small-eye jokes about Asian faces, and the film seems especially eager to emasculate Asian men by suggesting that they are effeminate, inherently undesirable, and and 'unable to naturally compete with White guys'. This is a direct quote from the script:

&gt;**""You know a few years ago Asian men were deemed the 'least desirable' on dating apps - not everyone's thirsty for kimchi!""**

and just a few lines later:

&gt;**""Type 'BTS' into YouTube and you'll get the picture.""**

There are ching-chong quips about Korean names and quite a few crass jokes about North Korea sprinkled throughout the script. **Perhaps most horrific of all was a part about a K-pop agency CEO checking to see if his female trainees were still virgins** \- it's clear that while this film might play everything off as ""just joking around"", it's reflective of a desire to frame K-pop as both frivolous and exploitative compared to the Western music industry.

The timing of this film seems calculated just to ride the current Hallyu wave sweeping across the US and milk profit off of it while also desperately insisting that K-pop is nothing more than a ridiculous fad we'd be better off without. I'm so disappointed in how eager the American entertainment industry is to sneer at and belittle Asian people, especially when these Korean boy groups are growing large enough to directly challenge Western artists.",126,1

788,2019-11-23,2019,11,23,3,e05043,Sorting BTS from lawful good to chaotic evil,fjadrargljufur,1574447116,"I was watching some youtube crack videos where kpop groups were sorted using D&amp;D's alignment system (i.e. lawful good to chaotic evil) and it got me thinking. **How would you sort BTS using the alignment chart?**

For those of you unfamiliar with it, it's a 3 x 3 chart (9 categories total) that reflects 2 spectrums: Good vs. Evil and Law vs. Chaos. [Here](http://easydamus.com/alignment.html) is some more information and below is the chart itself.

|Lawful Good|Neutral Good|Chaotic Good|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lawful Neutral|True Neutral|Chaotic Neutral|
|Lawful Evil|Neutral Evil|Chaotic Evil|

This is my loose take on it. I may or may not have had their RUN episodes in mind when doing this...

* **Jin** \- Chaotic Evil
* **Yoongi** \- Neutral Evil
* **Hobi** \- Lawful Good
* **Namjoon** \- Lawful Neutral
* **Jimin** \- Chaotic Neutral
* **Tae** \- True Neutral
* **Jungkook** \- Chaotic Good

I chose not to have any overlap, but you can if you want! Jin/Yoongi were no-brainers for me, but Tae was surprisingly difficultI'm still undecided between True Neutral or Neutral Evil.

Sidenote: This is meant to be for fun. I obviously don't believe any of the members are evil people &lt;\_&lt;. Also, here is a [funny alignment chart of western media interviews with BTS.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DO4RTjgVwAAE2bX.jpg)",39,1

Since the Sao Paulo dvd was announced, I've been wondering what other LY/SY stops might still be in the works. While not confirmed, there's no doubt in my mind that Seoul the Final Day 3 is getting a release. 



Keeping in mind that each dvd release comes with backstage footage, what LY/SY stops do you think deserves a dvd release?



For me personally, while I doubt it would happen, I think it was both amazing (and terrifying) to see BTS dance in the rain on the Chicago speak yourself stops. That's the kind of dedication that I want to re-watch in HD and show my GP friends.  Chicago could also have TXT backstage.  As a second choice, I'd also want a Rose Bowl one with the back cover proclaiming that BTS is the highest grossing artist to play there.",48,1

Just to be clear, there is NO CHANCE of BTS having their comeback stage there. Performance slots are largely reserved for the nominees. The only exceptions being:

1) A collaboration stage with a nominee

2) Join in on a tribute to an older artist 

Other options are to be presenters again.

Do you think its worth going with a comeback looming? Im leaning towards no. I think I rather they focus on preparing for their next comeback.",48,1

SONG 2: Fake Love  
SONG 3: I Need U  
SONG 4: Miss Right   
SONG 5: DNA   
SONG 6: Anpanman  
SONG 7: Spring Day  
SONG 8: Attack on Bangtan  
SONG 9: Mikrokosmos  
SONG 10: 2!3! 

The answers were interesting, because the first one who got it right, u/Cha0sTasTiiC, didn't follow the instructions to indicate a bias/OT7 before the answer (I was going after the same-ish format of the Run! game) XD But it was very impressive that s/he got it so quickly within a few minutes when my post went up!

So technically, the first one to guess everything right within the rules was u/kidah (because s/he said his/her bias before the answers haha!) 

Special mention to these ARMY redditors who participated, thanks for joining the game! It was so fun reading your guesses and answers. :D

I've read a bunch of little facts about the way the BTS members speak, like a few days ago in the post about Eat Jin some people was commenting on how clear his diction is. I also remember reading about how Tae's way of speaking is unusual in the sense that he construct his phrases in not so common ways, and I think I also read somewhere Yoongi can sort of slur a bit when he speaks. Since I don't know Korean and I'm sure there are many fellow Korean Armys in this subreddit, I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the particularities of how the boys speak. I'm not talking about their hometown accent, but things like:

\-Who uses more regular/normal vocabulary? Who has a wider vocabulary when speaking or uses more specific or poetic words? (I'm betting on Namjoon in this one)

\-Does any of them speak in a more old-fashioned way? Or any of them uses a lot of modern slang?

\-Does any of them repeat a certain word or expression a lot?

\-Does the way you speak correlate to your social status in Korea, and does that show in any of the members way of speaking?

\-Is anyone particularly cutesy or uses more aegyo, or on the contrary, more serious or rough? 

\-What about their tone of voice? Does it lean to more gentle? Kind? More dry? Commanding?

As you can see I'm completely ignorant about this, so any particularity or thing you've noticed that you would like to share is very welcomed. Thank you and have a great day!",83,1
929,2019-11-27,2019,11,27,0,e1z57r,A serious disscusion about BTS,Trashy_22,1574780774,"So there's probably a million posts like this out there but I want to have a good productive disscusion over BTS' music from the standpoint of your average viewer (aka not a music expert).

I also like BTS primarily because of their personalities. I'd like them as people even if their music was shit.

Now I see people complaining that BTS's music is ""becoming stale and boring"" and that  ""they've changed"" often citing Wings as their best era, abd wishing that BTS would go back to that concept.

Imo BTS has changed ( not nescesarily in a bad way) and I think there are a few reasons for this.

The first, and why many older fans feel that the songs just aren't bangtan anymore, is because of the changes in production. 

I think that now there are just too many people working on one song. If you look at the credits for BWL there are like seven people who gave lyrics and just as many producers. That's a lot, and makes things feel messy. Another factor might be Suga and J-Hope stepping down from production. A lot of the songs that  feel very BTS (Dope is the prime example and the most 'bts' song to ever exist) were written and produced by the rapline and usually Pdogg, Bang-PD or some other inhouse producer. Their music changed because the people working on it changed too. 

The second is that they are focusing more on the vocal line, with the rap parts in songs decreasing every comeback. I think that's bad because the rap line is stronger than the vocal line. They have one of the best raplines in all of kpop with each member having a different style (Namjoon is best when rapping calmly so he can show his fantastic lyric skills ; think ddeang, Yoongi is best at high energy raps where he can show just how fast he can go ; think Agust D, all the Cyphers, I'm fine, Hoseok has great flow and I love his-not-quite-rapping-not-quite-singing ; think his entire mixtape). I find that the rap parts, especially Sope transitions, are my favorite parts in songs. I also love it when the rapers do their parts more slowly, singing but not really. Namjoon in Not Today is my kink.

I prefer songs produced by the rapline, with Yoongi in particular having worked on some of my favorite songs Dead Leaves, Boyz with Fun, Tomorrow, Let me know, Hold me tight ect. Dionysus, which had J-Hope as one of the main writers, for example, is one of the most well-recieved tracks in MOTS:Persona. 

The third isn't a bad thing. Their image has changed along with their standing in the industry. Bangtan was a group of teens struggling against life and reaching for their dream, Beyond the Scene are a group of adults who've made it and are trying to inspire the new generation with positive messages. They feel unreachable, unreal. Their music is growing with them.

Lastly, I feel like their latest title tracks are almost over-produced and cartoony. In particular DNA and IDOL. The MVs are a mess with too many effects and transitions. I like their simpler MVs like Save Me, Run or Not Today (the color grading here is fantastic). They feel more grounded and touching. Wings era (although not my favorite) had the best visuals period. BST was movie quality. That's just my opionon though.

Regarding every album and era, let's start from the beging. 

- The school trilogy has great title tracks with not that special a concept. Very hip-hop, almost too much. The b-side tracks aren't very memorable. My faves include We are bulletproof pt2, No more dream, N.O. , Tomorrow, Boy in Luv. Attack on Bangtan and Spine breaker are very fun high energy songs.

-Dark &amp; Wild is a bit of an oddball, but it still has some good tracks. I love Danger, Let me Know and Rain (this one is so good and I love the lyrics)

-HYYH pt.1 has some of their best and most memorable songs (rapline produced a lot of these). Dope, Boyz with Fun, Hold me Tight, Converse High and I Need U (an absolute bop)

-HYYH pt.2 I love every single song on this album. They are great lyrically and are all very memorable. They feel very bts. With songs like Baepsae, Dead Leaves, Run, Butterfly, Nevermind, Whalien 52, Ma City and House of Cards, its a given.

-Young Forever adds Fire, Outro : Young Forever and a bunch of remixes. Fire is well fire-y, for sure gets you pumped up, and Young Forever has made me cry too many times to count.

-Wings marks a major change for bts. The album, with lots of classical influence, sounds different than their previous ones. The solos and 2!3! are good, but the rest of the tracks are quite forgetable. Imo this era is overhyped. It was good, but BTS has done better. A big reason for its popularity is 100% the sexy and dark concept.

-You never walk alone adds Spring Day and Not Today, two of my faves, especially the latter.  Spring day is the begining of overproduction I think.

-LY trilogy: The title tracks are worse amd not that impactuful, but they have some of the best B-side tracks. I love I'm Fine as a continuation to Save Me. I think everyone agrees that Pied Piper is a gem and the solos are all great. I like tear the most out of these three, with my faves being Paradise, Airplane pt.2, 134340, The Truth Untold, and Outro : Tear (I loooove this one.) A big reason people see LY as worse is because the tracks all vary so much in quality. You have great songs like the ones mentioned above, okay ones like Fake Love, DNA and Mic Drop, and very forgetable ones like So What, IDOL and Best of Me. Compared to something like HYYH pt.2 where every song was good, people might see it as lackluster.

-MOTS : Persona is alright. BWL is catchy but nothing special, same with Mikrokosmos and Jamais Vu (I like these a bit more) and my fave tracks are the Intro, Home and Dionysus. We'll see how Shadow is. I like that the entire album feels like a giant thank you card, with so many references from their older music.

In conclusion, I think BTS have changed, and their Title Track quality has somewhat drecreased. I think this is beacuse they've been doing so many collabs and so many people are working on the songs that the Title Tracks have become generic and lost their 'soul'. I hope that Shadow is produced inhouse and with a lot of creative input from the members themselves. BTS make the best music when they put their feelings into it and don't rush things.


Okay so that's long af. I'd love it if you could give me your opinions on BTS' music. Which era do you think is best? Did you like MOTS? What are you looking for in them? Do you think their music is worse or better?",4,1

This last Sunday, we had a 'Happy Thanks-JIN-ing' event at a Korean BBQ place in the Twin Cities.  While we had three sections reserved, there were still a ton of open areas for the locals to be eating, and it was obvious a lot of them were confused as we started decorating the open section of wall near us with all the fall/Jin decor we had brought along.

What really gave me the warm fuzzies though was when an older gentleman, graying hair, nicely dressed, probably in his 60's or later, came up to me as I was taping a gorgeous picture of our dearest Seokjinnie to the wall and asked 'What is ThanksJINing?'  The large letter banner we'd edited a J in place of the G was already strung up for all to see.

I was slightly stunned, cause it's Minnesota - the older folks tend to only care much for hunting or sports in general in my experiences - but quickly caught myself and explained that Jin's birthday was coming up.  Pointed to the picture I had just posted for reference and said he was from BTS and that the group I was with were all fans of them.

'What's BTS?'

I'll admit my brain was still slightly in panic mode so I blurted out 'They're a Korean boy band ( still want to go back and change that part of the conversation xD ) that's crazy popular right now, worldwide.'

The man give me an appreciative smile, a curious 'oh', then said thanks and went to go back and sit with his group.

I really want to own a copy of the Muster to watch here at home. I'm hoping it's just not a VLIVE thing because my 2 sons love watching the Love yourself Blu Ray (the only video I own) over and over on the different TV's so Blu Ray works best (and I don't want them on my laptop...they're too little). Also, it looks like there's 2 Musters from this year? I see that one just happened I think. If so are they the same or is one better than the other? 

I appreciate any help you can give me. I'm not ""techy"" and am pretty lost with different apps outside of IG and FB. I do have VLIVE on my phone but it's a free acct and I barely use it unless I'm watching run BTS. I'm old and prefer hard copies of things. Haha.",1,1

so last weekend I got super bored and went through BTS' Twitter account and saved and organised all pictures, and I thought I could share them with everyone. 

The pictures are sorted by member and units. ~~(I might have taken the unit-sorting a bit too serious, but oh well.)~~ The names of the pictures are the dates they were posted on. 

If you find that any pictures have been accidentally put in the wrong folder, please let me know! After about 12 hours my drag-and-drop game might have suffered a little, haha.

I really enjoyed reliving all those pictures - including discovering lots I had not seen before. I hope you can too. :)

I don't remember where we were going, but my sister was like ""so I found this band called exo. I'm going to play it."" (Not exact words, but simplified)

 I was like ""it's okay."" Then went back to looking out of the window. 

The next day we were riding in the car and my sister said ""so I found this band called BTS."" She played 'boy in love.' Instantly my head snapped over, and I was in love. 

I was listening when RM came on. I was like ""who's this?"" 

She replied ""that's rap monster."" It was back before he went by RM. 

If you looked at my face back at that moment you would know instantly that my face said ""I'm gonna search them up.""

I decided a few weeks later that just listening to them wouldn't do. So I looked at pictures of them. Every time I picked out RM as my favorite. I had no idea that he was the one I loved the voice of. 

After I discovered, by my sister, that he was the same person, I decided to look at videos of all of them. Making sure RM was last. (So I wouldn't be bias towards him before I knew everything.) I loved all of them but he made me laugh more than anyone ever has.

 I do notice that everytime I see him or hear him I get a wonderful, happy, loving, trusting feeling. This goes back to the first time I heard his voice. My family is known for our good intuition. When I even hear about someone, I know instantly if I will like them. Usually if I have a horrible feeling about someone I have that feeling everytime I see them. If I have a good feeling about someone I have that feeling one time. But I never had a feeling for a human that was better than that... until... RM. Everytime I hear his name, hear his voice, and especially see him (in videos because I wouldn't be able to see him unless he came to TN) I get a beyond wonderful feeling. I can't even explain what feeling I feel, it's that good. 

That is how he became my bias.",103,1

At present, work has been slow and I've been getting bored. So I randomly started typing the BTS fanchant on a Excel sheet and then I thought ""Hey, why don't I write names of all K-pop idols and other details and analyse the data"" 

So as a joke, I kept adding fields and recording details. Now, I used Ctrl+D to transfer data from names to stage name so I could edit them. After I input j-hope Excel automatically filled up all stage names using a formula.

First letter of family name + Two letters of Name + ""PE"" 
Jimin's stage name as P-JIPE, Taehyung's stage name as K-TAPE and Jungkook as J-JUPE. I can't stop laughing someone help me. Also is there any kind of data you guys have ideas for me to analyse? I'm compiling data of all Kpop idols I know. It's a 120 names till now. I actually planned to group all idols by family name.

Joon: [Taschen book on Eames](https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/49209/facts.eames.htm) design history. I think Eames' clean lines would suit his taste and style preferences, at least from the things we've seen him purchase before and he's clearly interested in the arts and design. 

JK: [Uaena fanclub membership](https://iu-jjang.tumblr.com/fanclub)! I would get him something to do with lifting, but it looks like (from the vlog) that he doesn't do super heavy lifts and wouldn't need anything like wraps or straps, etc. This one's hard!

Hobi: This is a bit of a meme one, but I'd give him a personalized [Supreme collar](https://pekopets.com/products/supreme-collar) for Mickey. 

Jimin: Honestly one of the harder ones to pick, since he seems to like higher-end stuff and doesn't seem to have a singular hobby. Maybe I'd go for a [fancy-dancy airplane pillow](https://www.amazon.com/Cordless-Vertebra-Massage-Electric-Travel/dp/B07Q5YH42N/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=heated+travel+pillow&amp;qid=1575044762&amp;sr=8-9)for his neck - it has good reviews IDK  \\\_()\_/

Tae: One sheet of [Kodak Aerochrome Infrared film](https://www.aerochrome.shop/product-page/aerochrome-120-color-infrared-film). This is a really cool type of film that creates a unique effect and would be really fun to experiment with. I think he'd have fun shooting with this. 

Yoongi: [Taschen book on Le Corbusier](https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/49211/facts.le_corbusier.htm), and tiny bottle of [Glenlivet 1981](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/50772/glenlivet-1981-sample-36-year-old-twe-exclusive). Yoongi's mentioned multiple times that he wanted to be an architect when he was young, and is still interested in architecture - as someone with this background I'd give him this book because Le Corbusier is one of the world's most influential architects and designers of all time. Glenlivet because... y'all know why. 

Jin: I'm not sure if he still collects Mario stuff, but I thought he might like a [Mario acrylic desk lamp](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Night-Light-Acrylic-Lamp-LED-Jumpman-Mario-Home-Deco-Touch-Light-Desk-Toy-Ver-B/174027055049?hash=item2884d21fc9:g:wu8AAOSwcWJb2Aqi). Could be an interesting accessory at the studio, and isn't huge. 

I'd love to see what other stuff you guys come up with! (Links would be great too!)",28,1

Which is why Im also in search of the same case for the iPhone 11. 

Selling the case for $40 shipping not included. Willing to ship anywhere, but within the US would be easier.

This has legitimately never been worn. It's taken out of the individual packaging and been set on a shelf for around 4 years now. Originally bought in around 2015. If needed, I bet I could go through my email and find the confirmation to confirm that it is official merchandise and not a ""fake"" if that's an issue to some people.

I'm looking for around ~$150.00 for it. It was originally around 90USD for me when it was in stock 4 years ago on the store, and it is no longer in stock on their store and is pretty hard to find. 

I'm willing to pay for the shipping and be quite flexible on the price to be honest. I kind of just want it gone out of my closet without losing more money than I paid for it. I'll even add in some photocards that I have multiples of if it is any bit of a bonus.

Please let me know if you are interested and we can talk about the price and everything!",0,1
