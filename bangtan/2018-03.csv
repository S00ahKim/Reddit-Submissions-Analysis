0,2018-3-1,2018,3,1,9,8117c0,Discussion: Bighit provide sub for mv and vlive but not bangtan bombs,92sn,1519864918,"Hi guys, I am sometimes wonder why did bighit not provide sub for bangtan bombs compared to their music videos and vlive. However, I do think that while sometimes its frustrated to wait someone to sub it, but I do think it already create a great impact for army community to work together for the sub. 
What do you guys think about this? Is that good decision by bighit to not provide sub or they should hire someone like from vlive to sub bangtan bombs too?",37,96

What are we expecting from Hoseok today? Something amazing?! Probably!

My thoughts for everyone today are, will we get an ultimate trio mixtape of the a mature RM, Agust D, and JHope? However if this was to happen, it probably wont happen for a few more years. 

And also, if there are any asian men on this sub, since the boys have made it into the western mainstream (almost), have you felt that youre more represented in the entertainment industry now? Has this affected your relationship with women, as in have more women taken interest in you because of this Hallyu wave?

I'm going to the LINE store today to pick up a mug for myself and I'd be happy to pick up a few items to ship to other people as well, up to 10 items (which I believe is the limit). I'm shipping out a whole bunch of BTS merch to people on Friday so might as well add a few more things to the mix, right? :P

I've met my cushion limit, but in case anyone wants a mug or some stationary...let me know!

Please PM me! Pricing would be the *cost of the item + $2.00 (to cover packaging &amp; tax) + whatever shipping turns out to be.* 

I'll edit this post as soon as I've reached the limit.~~

&amp;nbsp;

J-Hope of BTS has presented his first solo work in the form of mixtape. He is the third one to release a mixtape from BTS, following RM and Suga. His mixtape, which he's known to have worked hard on for about a year, has a total of 7 tracks. J-Hope has released all tracks of his mixtape for free. Despite it being a solo album of a member from a boy band that is not only domestically but also internationally popular, commercial intentions are completely excluded.

&amp;nbsp;

*Modesty and authenticity of a musician*

J-Hope debuted as a member of BTS and is consistently making appearances at world's most important stages as a singer in his sixth year since debut. However, this is his first time showing his musical identity, and he shows an attitude that he is a complete rookie as a solo musician. J-Hope's mixtape has the premise that 'it is not a final work yet'. Although he's a member of a world-class boy band that gets on the stage of the BBMAs and the AMAs, it means that he will wait for general public's assessment with modesty. In terms of quality, his mixtape is too good to be called a mixtape. He didn't choose an easy way of utilizing a well-known existing beats and tracks, and the recording and sound are also outstanding.

The free distribution of music that he has worked hard on proves his authentic attitude towards music. A solo album in the form of mixtape goes against the industry practice where a group gains its popularity, plans a solo album based on the name-value and news-making ability of the group, and takes commercial profits. Considering that BTS sell over a million copies of an album, free distribution does not fit into typical business sense. If we add additional commercial benefits coming from a regular solo album such as various merchandise products and a solo concert, it becomes even clearer that they are excluding any commercial intention. One could honestly wonder why they have to go that far, but it really shows their message 'music rather than money.'

&amp;nbsp;

*The value of music that you have to search for*

J-Hope released his mixtape through SoundCould, Google, MediaFire, Dropbox, DatPiff, and so on. These methods of free music distribution make the music less accessible. Ironically, you have to 'search' for the music because it is free. In the era of online music and streaming, the way of music consumption became extremely more passive compared to the past. The recommendation system and chart rankings of each digital music platform became to decide what new music we listen. Standing in line in front of a music store to purchase your favorite musician's album became a rare and symbolic thing. The fact that we can easily access music on mobile devices made us consume music lightly and forget music easily. It is a natural phenomenon due to changes in the device environment, but those who make music take it differently. They still put their heart and soul into music in the same way. However, the attitude of listeners who consume the music and the values of the music perceived by the listeners have dramatically changed. The same goes to the listeners. The meanings of the music that you waited, searched, and found and the music that you heard from somewhere are completely different, not to mention the joy, impression, and memory of music. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Trust of Big Hit*  

To say objectively, an agency has no reason to appreciate its artist making some music that doesn't make money. Especially, the fact a member of BTS, who have insanely packed schedules at home and abroad, is putting his time and effort into his own solo work might be worrying as it could affect team activities. This is true even if he takes a leading role in everything: recording, mixing, and mastering. Of course, if one decides to look at the long-term perspective, it is without a doubt a great investment as the growth of him as an artist will bring greater added values. However, one can never be sure whether his potential will appear at a proper time or whether he will be able to recover the costs at all. It remains as a question whether Big Hit's allowing J-Hope to create his mixtape can be justified as a reasonable investment. 

Nonetheless, Big Hit spares no cost on the mixtape production not only of J-Hope but also of other members. Big Hit produced a music video for the title track 'Daydream', and promoted the release through V App Live. All these are not possible without love and full trust in the singer. The reason is simple. As I mentioned earlier, it is because their goal is to make the artist grow. Even if it doesn't guarantee them any monetary profits right away, it is enough for them if J-Hope can stand up to the world as a solo musician. This is a proof that our pop culture does not work solely based on an algorithm for creating monetary benefits. This shows how a new artist is born.

The main issue I am focusing on is BTS' mental health awareness. I have already gathered a few references, such as their Billboard interview where they discussed the hardships of our youth and mental health. 
&gt; RM from BTS also said he was shocked at the fellow [Kim Jonghyun of SHINee] singers death, especially because of his success in the music world. It's important to remember, however, that no matter how someone's life looks from the outside, they still may have a mental illness. That's why RM said he hopes lawmakers will enact a plan to relieve stress for younger generations who are struggling in any way.

&gt; Every day is stressful for our generation. It's hard to get a job, it's harder to attend college now more than ever... Adults need to create policies that can facilitate that overall social change,"" RM told Billboard


&gt; The issues that RM touched on are backed by science, too. Research released by The American College Health Association showed that 84% of U.S. students feel they can't cope with their mental health, 60% said they feel ""very sad,"" and more than 50% said they experience overwhelming anxiety. The results came from a survey of more than 100,000 college students at 53 campuses across the United States.
&gt; 

&gt;More statistics released by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) show that 20% of people between the ages of 13 to 18 live with a mental illness, and that suicide is the third leading cause of death in youth ages 10 to 24.

I am also planning to discuss how influential and accomplished they became last year, and how they use their position to shed light on important topics like self-worth. They are the perfect ambassadors for our youth, and are very socially conscious.


I felt like I needed help from you guys since I am mostly a casual fan of BTS, and I thought you would definitely know more about this than I do. I had a bit of trouble finding a variety of references (the main thing that showed up was the Billboard interview) of BTS and social/mental health awareness. If any one of you could help me, I would be very grateful.",5,29

98,2018-3-3,2018,3,3,6,81im1y,How much of 'J-hope' was unmasked in Hope World?,aye_zt,1520026788,"I suppose it is time for us to have a bit of a deeper discussion on Hobi's wonderful mixtape! There had been comments earlier that were going in that direction in the first few threads on Hope World but because we were all spazzing in surprise and wonderment (for good reason), they were drowned amongst the many comments, lol.

In this thread, I'll talk about the many thoughts/feelings i had in understanding the 'Hope World' project as a whole. I feel we might need another thread for discussing the art style, directing of the Daydream MV and the many recurring references, motifs that Lumpens added. So I'll leave that for someone else to initiate. 

In waiting for Hobi's mixtape, I inevitably listened to the previous 2 mixtapes RM and Agust D **a lot**. So when Hope World came out, there were many differences I noticed between the 3. In one of the previous threads someone mentioned how there was an expectation amongst us that Hobi might be removing his 'J-hope' mask in this mixtape ^which ^at ^first ^listen ^I ^thought ^he ^didn't ^do. Even so, I still really enjoyed the mixtape because (as many have already reiterated) it is *so* **J-Hope**. His authenticity and personality cannot be forgotten when listening to the tracks. But I also wondered why he did not reveal more of his darker side? That made me question why was I expecting something like that from J-hope in the 1st place? Was it fair of me to expect that from him? 

I think its b/c the previous 2 mixtapes, RM and Agust D, ended up being so much darker than I expected, I thought it would be natural that Hope World would follow suite. But I think that was a wrong expectation on my side. Both Namjoon and Yoongi had left-over sentiments from the underground scene that they needed to express and get out of their system after becoming idols. So the intentions behind their mixtapes were very different from Hobi's, who i think was not harboring such feelings at all, since he was originally a street-dancer and not a rapper. He did not have the need to prove his worth as a rapper like Namjoon and Yoongi did. That is why if I re-analyze the reason why Hobi is releasing this mixtape, like he said in his recent V live Behind, it was purely out of the encouragement by the people around him that he wanted to start this project and make original beats all by himself. I think it was a way to challenge himself, find a way to express his creativity and further develop himself as a musician. As he said, he took his time to study and research different ways to say what he wanted to say. That is why I think his mixtape not being dark is very much in line with his personality. And if his music wasn't as bright as him, there would be something extremely confusing about his public persona then. 

Having said that, one cannot deny that there are some darker elements present on the lyrical side of the mixtape. But I think that's only natural since there are darker elements present in almost everyone. His tracks are upbeat but they mask the 'shadow' side of his personality, as he described it in his V live Behind. Especially 'Daydream'. This is actually not a very bright song if you think about why Hobi is choosing to daydream instead of facing reality. That brings one back to the question *'why does Hobi have such a bright person?'* I think its b/c being bright is what makes him move forward when facing difficulties in life. His sunshiney personality is what helps him during those times. That is why even when he wants to say something sad/dark in his music, he says it in a bright way. These are all speculations from my side...perhaps he doesn't like dwelling on the negative side of things and doesn't want others to dwell on them either when listening to his music? I find it interesting when i compare his lyrics to Suga's alter-ego Agust D. Agust D wanted more fame and more money even when he was afraid his greed might turn him into a monster. In Hobi's case, he says he has desires too, but he doesn't want to fulfill them, he just wants to dream about them before waking up? Its an interesting approach. It really shows the difference in their personalities. Where Agust D was more straightforward with his wish to fulfill his desires. J-Hope doesn't even dwell on the possible reality of his desires, as if its something he cannot even begin to think about being the public figure he has now become. So he satisfies himself by merely daydreaming or creating a fantasy about it all. It could sound sad, it could sound harmless...that's up to each individual to decide...???

At the end, when I think about it, Hobi does unmask aspects of himself in this mixtape. But it is *very* different from the way Namjoon or Yoongi unmasked themselves in their mixtapes. It's because Hobi feels the need to always be bright as that is what defines him as a person and his life approach, just like being reflective about things defines Namjoon or being straightforward about things defines Yoongi. 

I thought there were some basic similarities between P.O.P. (Piece of Peace) Pt. 1, I Believe and So Far Away in terms of having a hopeful message that one could end a mixtape on. So I find it interesting that Hobi did not end on P.O.P. but rather Blue Side (outro). This was another comment I read in one of the threads, someone was asking why end on Blue Side? What do you all think? 

I think Blue Side was a curve ball in this mixtape, it was that one track I was not expecting from Hobi. I wonder if this is the track that Namjoon mentioned in an old V live that reminded him of his first meeting with Hobi? It is laden with the nostalgic heaviness of a past that begs to be expanded on! If I wanted anything more from this mixtape, it was for Hobi to make Blue Side longer...just make it trail on and on with the same words/melody, even if it becomes repetitive. I think repetition has an interesting introspective quality to it that would've suited Blue Side (maybe that's just me, probably most people get bored of repetition). Aside from that, nothing too intricate can be gauged out of Blue Side, it is too short and cryptic. If there's anything that was reaffirmed for me about Hobi from this mixtape, it was that he does not like to indulge too much of his personal self to the public. The unexplored subtleness and depth within Blue Side is probably the most we'll be getting out of him (for now). I really like that he ended on Blue Side tho, it gave me much food for thought and reflection about Hope World as a whole. 

I think I went on for too long! These were my overall thoughts after I listened to Hope World and what I felt I learned about Hobi, in comparing his mixtape with Namjoon's and Yoongi's. I'm pretty sure there's much more that can be said when comparing all 3 of the mixtapes. 

What were your thoughts on Hope World? I didn't talk much about his other tracks, so feel free to talk about them and what you think you learned/discovered through them about Hobi as a person.

103,2018-3-3,2018,3,3,8,81juki,A (long) personal post: Bangtan and my body image,Phoenixfire321,1520033458,"** Please delete this post if its not appropriate for the subreddit. Im just really hoping to have a discussion, about thoughts Ive had a lot recently, with others who might understand from the perspective of a fellow K-pop fan - specifically, an ARMY. Hopefully, I can have a discussion that might help me sort out my own thoughts and unhappiness.

Background info: Im a first generation Asian American female. I love BTS, started really following them when the BST MV was released. Before then, I was also a fan of SHINee around 2013 and EXO around 2015. My taste in K-pop has always been following a single group really intensely With BTS now, I feel like theyre different in significant ways from the other groups Ive followed before and thats a big part of why I love them.

Ive always been a tomboy. My hair was short when I was a child and I was bullied by some for looking like a boy. I never really took care of my appearance, fashion, or style. Even though Ive followed other K-pop groups before, I feel like this new attitude Im having has really intensified in the past several months as Ive been an ARMY specifically. Im much more aware of my appearance now. I find myself wishing I could have a team of stylists like BTS does, admiring so much of their fashion and hairstyle and wishing I could pull off that stuff the same way. 

I understand that they are celebrities and those things are part of their roles and concepts. I understand that a lot of K-pop fans admire their idols looks - but some fans might admire in a way that also makes them feel ugly and insecure in comparison. I think thats what Im doing right now. BTS can pull off incredibly diverse concepts and still look good with different makeup, wardrobes, and hairstyles and hair colors - they just seem perfect. Meanwhile, as I admire that, Im feeling more and more unhappiness about my own appearance. 

I dont follow any girl groups and never have. I never find myself admiring their appearances as much as I do for BTS. Im sure part of it is finding BTS attractive, but between their styles and those of girl groups, Id much rather want to try BTSs styles. Since Im a female in a western society, though, I feel like it would be so hard for me to do that. Maybe that also lends to my dissatisfaction with myself.

I wish that I could have a team of personal stylists who could get me to look that great all the time. It almost feels, by this point, like its something thats missing that would make my life more whole. I know that realistically this would be very unfeasible for me because I am not a celebrity - on the other hand, BTS are managed by a company and they are idol entertainers for whom appearance is micromanaged. They have access to all the best resources. I understand all of that rationally, but the insecurity about my own appearance and wishing I could change it is still tormenting me.

I almost want to move to Korea to find the exact stylists who can help me, but there are so many things that are unhealthy about that kind of thinking. Still, I keep thinking it.

Maybe learning some basic things, like hair styling concepts and fashion styling concepts - and being able to understand and identify what techniques BTS are using for their concepts - would help, but I also have no idea how to seek help that would address my very specific concerns with these issues. How would I explain this to a hair stylist at a salon in real life? Or find someone with great fashion sense who wouldn't think these specific worries are weird and pointless? Theres lots of general fashion and hair advice on the Internet but I dont know what to do with it. I can't follow it well enough to make myself look good.

Whew, that was a long post. If youve read all of it, thank you SO much for taking the time to do so. Ive seen incredibly thoughtful threads in r/bangtan and great community discussions on all kinds of things, and I love ARMY about as much as I love BTS, so I truly hope I can find people to talk about this with - whether thats in real life or virtually.",37,89

Of course, I don't endorse people disclosing private information about them, but I just love hearing the little harmless stories about them, like Jungkook picking up trash after ISAC last year or just how generally kind and fun they are even off camera. I love hearing about them from staff, their friends, and fellow fans because its nice hearing about how they act off camera in a more casual context.

&amp;nbsp;

Ji Seunghoon (Reporter, YTN Stars) and Kei.G (Singer, Planetarium Records) introduce hidden masterpieces in pop music on their new show, 'Sepaktakraw'. 

Ji introduced BTS' 'Love is not over' from their third mini album HYYH Pt. 1 released in 2015. This is the first song produced by Jungkook, the youngest and the main vocalist of the group, which is a ballad song that showcases BTS' vocal line's capability. 'Love is not over' is an outro track that captivates listeners just with minimal composition and calm vocal. It is also a song where Jungkook revealed his piano skill. From the heartbreaking ballad song that talks about pain of love and parting, Ji picked the lyrics 'love is pain after pain' as the killing part. The members sing pain and sorrow of love with their mournful voice, making the listeners emotional. 

&amp;nbsp;

How much time was in between the MV releases and what song on Hope World do you think will get an MV? I'm personally hoping for Hangsang or Airplane. Hangsang is so hype that the choreo would be so lit. Airplane is a good choice since it's about J-hope reflecting on his success and achievements and it would be nice to see the other BTS members cameo since they do some of the back vocals towards the end of the track. Not to mention, the atmospheric feel of the song gives the music director sooo much to work with. It has potential to be a very aesthetically intriguing music video.",19,64

I have a question about BTS studio version of their raps and like rap songs studio version in general. Not live.
Ok so whenever I listen to rap songs such as Manolo, Bartier Cardi, or RapGod (just a few examples that I could come up with), I can never hear the rapper takes a breath before they continue their next rapping line. Its like they dont breathe at all but keeps on rapping. I wonder if there is a special technique to do that or is it edited, like punching in? Because when I listen to BTS songs I can actually hear Yoongi or Namjoon taking a breath before they rap, most specifically Yoongi in First Love or The Last, which I believe to be intentional. However there are also other less emotional songs such as Do You by RM that I can still hear the breathdrawing even tho its less obvious than Sugas Give It To Me. 
I want to know if BTS does it intentionally or its because rapline doesnt have as good a rapping technique to hold their breath as long or bc they choose to not do punch in? I dont know if I explain it well Im not familiar with this topic really  I would love to hear from someone who knows more about this than I do. And if there are other BTS songs that doesnt have rapline taking a breath let me know too.

&amp;nbsp;

*[Translation]*

Hope World, a mixtape released by J-Hope of BTS on the 2nd, is freely downloadable. It is not even registered on Korean digital music chart, and theres no TV appearance. Time, an American weekly magazine, nonetheless conducted an interview with J-Hope on Hope World. His Naver V App live broadcasted right after from his studio the release of Hope World had more than a million viewers at the time of broadcasting. The music video of Daydream shows the present of not only of himself but of BTS. In the video, hes lying on a bed. But as the walls collapse and disappear, he lies in front of the vast nature. He reveals his small life to the big world.

&amp;nbsp;

However, the moment that he is exposed to the world gives a sense of liberation. The space that felt cramped turns into a horizontally widely open space as the walls disappear. This is also his attitude of life he shows through Hope World, the first track of the album: To speak about myself, every day is a D-day / life of appreciation for what is given / a life created by anticipation of life / In my 20s trusting myself and working  (Hope World). He also sees his own face on the Front cover of magazine whenever opening my eyes (HANGSANG), so needs to abstain from large cravings although he wants to party life crazy (Daydream). J-hope, however, tries to live like an optimist just joyfully (Hop World). He delivers his solid self that strives to keep himself as the same during the tremendous success of the team. 

&amp;nbsp;

J-Hope stood in the middle of the stage of DNA and led the most exciting part of the performance. A person in broadcasting industry said that he constantly encourages the energy of the other members when they record a performance. RM, the leader, chose J-Hope as someone who fits the role of leader excluding himself. Hope World completes the image of J-hope, pieces of whom were revealed throughout the activities of BTS. He is energetic, positive, and spread his positive energy to the others. 

&amp;nbsp;

The way Hope World depicts his journey from within himself to the world itself explains himself. He defines himself in Hope World, and wishes that he could be an energy to someone saying that everyone makes mistakes and suffers (`P.O.P (Piece of Peace)). He describes the environment and hardships surrounding him as a net called desire with thirst in life and shows a will that he will for once I want a different picture in my life (Daydream). His swag on the success of BTS and his original intention come after Base Line where his searches for his root from 10 years of Street dance. He finds answers for himself and gradually reveal his attitude towards the world. On the way he reminisces about his excitement from flying to Japan for the first time (Airplane), and about the memories of him walking side by side with ma bro when there was no one on their side (HANGSANG). Hope World is not only a story how J-Hope reached where he is now, but also a story of the members of BTS becoming adults. 

&amp;nbsp;

In that respect, the mixtape of each BTS member is his own story and at the same time a supplementary story that strengthens and deepens the characters and storytelling of the main story called BTS. Another member, Suga, literally confessed his life from debut to the present through his mixtape Agust D. 724148 was no less than a documentary of his pre-debut life. On the other hand, J-Hope shows, now as superstars, what BTS prioritize and what dreams BTS depict. The process of him continuously putting more effort to grow with other members also gives a clue to how this team that started as rebels in the back of the classroom began to aspire to success through their constant practice such as Dope. 

&amp;nbsp;

As they write their stories through mixtape, BTS reflect their present, supplement the past, and capture the growth and change of the team and the members. The same applies to the musical direction of Hope World and P.O.P (Piece of Peace). Both are based on hip-top, but has a composition that can be seen from idol dance music such as the bridge in the second half that hypes up the song. He expresses his identity as a fun and energetic rapper/dancer in the first half of the album. This is also the present of BTS where, after DNA, they dont need to explain themselves through genres. 

&amp;nbsp;

Bangtan Sonyeons mixtapes, including Hope World seem like small and personal projects due to the form of mixtape, its distribution method, and the fact that it is a personal message. However, Hope World shows that both BTS and Big Hit Entertainment acknowledge how the mixtape of this team has an important meaning in proportion to the teams growth. The movements are small, but the meaning accumulates with the teams history, and the ripple effect is growing exponentially. Its worth noting that the full-fledged album staff of BTS participated in producing Hope World. Randy Merrill, whose past works include albums of BTS, Adele, and Taylor Swift, participated in mastering. As a result, Hope World showcases a superior recording that goes well beyond the scope of a typical mixtape. J-Hopes vocal is vivid as if he is narrating In the beginning of Hope World, but in Daydream, it gives a hazy and obscure felling like the title Daydream with subtle echoing although the tone is similar. On the other hand, the sound of the alarm in reality is as vivid as if the alarm sounds right from the side of listeners. Daydream shows the direction of this mixtape: different sounds has different sense of distance, sound effects are giving three-dimensional effects, and there is also some space left for the keyboard to quietly lead the song. Hope World is a mixtape that contains a personal story of J-Hope. Each track, however, was elaborately cut and trimmed like handcrafts.

&amp;nbsp;

In other words, Big Hit Entertainment still acknowledges that mixtape needs to be freely available and that theres no need for TV appearance. However, they also know that the content should be invested in a way that is not like mixtapes. It seems like they know how this small step plays in the big picture of BTS and what are needed. Its not possible to explain the success of BTS in a couple of ways. There may as well be a lot of coincidence and luck in their record-worthy success. What is clear, however, that they are moving towards where coincidence and luck are likely to occur. Hope World will remain as the proof. ",11,166

212,2018-3-6,2018,3,6,8,82a9sy,A little glossary of citations from BTS works was made and would like a bit of criticism to improve,Sub-versi0n,1520291014,"Hello!    
    
So, I made [this](https://behind-the-screen-of-bangtan.tumblr.com/glossary).  
This is a glossary listing some words and citations that appeared in BTS works like for example the [*Demian* citations](https://behind-the-screen-of-bangtan.tumblr.com/glossary#Dem) or some graffiti from [""No More Dream""](https://behind-the-screen-of-bangtan.tumblr.com/glossary#Jnj). Each entry lists the times where the words appeared (with a link to a post about said time, like the Short Films for the *Demian* citations) and if possible, is completed by a little explanation/context/meaning/translation (the presentation of the book *Demian*).    
    
While it means well and aims to be a practical tool, can we all agree it still needs ~~a lot of~~ improvement?  
I'd really appreciate if you could give me criticism/advice, be it about the general presentation, the choice of sections, the fonts, the colors, the content... I want it to be useful and easy to use so I'll take all ideas!  
(On that matter, I know the quick navigation bar isn't the right length on some browsers, my coding ability is rather basic...)    

And don't hesitate if you want to complete things or propose content! The team of highly trained monkeys may actually be only one monkey and said monkey may have a very limited general culture so she'll gladly accept help!    

I'll finish with a practical example to help plead my cause. In the most amazing mixtape of 2018 (also known as *Hope World*), the song [""Hangsang""](https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/5-hangsang-feat-supreme-boi-2?in=bangtan/sets/j-hope-hope-world) has the following line: ""BTS, ROCKBOTTOM, yeah that's my team"". If you check the entry ""Rockbottom"" in the glossary, you'll learn it already appeared in the photobook for *HYYH Pt.2* and is probably a reference to the Korean Hip Hop group ROCKBOTTOM (their [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPU8nV-8un8vl5ob1tELbTg/featured)), which notably includes Supreme Boi and Kim Sunghyun, who's BTS art director!

After watching it, I was reminded quite a lot of [BTS' N.O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmgxPLLLyVo). Am I saying it's plagiarism? Absolutely not; you can't copyright a 'concept' and I think the BTS fandom should be quite aware of how damaging false claims of plagiarism can be \(and why we should never do that \- it'd be hypocritical as hell\).

However, I do definitely think there was some sort of influence from BTS. Is being influenced by BTS a bad thing or does it make Stray Kids ""worse""? Nope, not in the slightest imo. In the same way BTS was influenced by Big Bang, Stray Kids can be influenced by BTS. But it did make me think of an interesting question \- in what ways are we going to start seeing future groups become influenced by BTS? I think it'll be interesting to see what other companies/CEOs think the ""BTS formula"" is and what parts of it they will start to incorporate. Or is there even a formula that's actually possible to replicate? edit: besides social media lol, we all know that and it's a boring answer that we all know isnt the only thing that made BTS successful

Further than that \- if companies start to see ""authenticity"" as a key part of the ""BTS formula"" \(and tbh it's definitely one of the biggest parts of their success imo \- both in presentation of personality and in music\), then what is ""formulaic authenticity"" going to start looking like in future groups? Or will they *actually* become more ""authentic""? \(this is the more interesting question imo\)

I was also trying to learn lyrics so I could sing along - and for me at least it is easier to memorize something when I know the meaning. So, I made this worksheet/booklet thing. It's a bit weird, but I put directions in it so hopefully, you can figure it out. I'll try to make more for the other LY:Her songs, though they are all longer so it might be a bit cramped. 

It's two pages, and it should work out ok if you print on letter size paper, front and back, landscape, fit (not actual size), flip on the long side (so it is right side up on both sides). I don't think you'll need to trim anything to make it fold right, but maybe. Please let me know if you see anything incorrect because I really don't speak Korean - just trying to learn and this was the tool I needed!

I have loved our boys since 2014, and indeed what piqued my interest in them are the Bangtan Bombs that they habitually released at the time. These days, I realize that a lot of the content that could have been released as Bombs are now commercialized, such as some of the stuff in Vlive. Well, I'm not against it; maybe it was the plan all along. 

But tonight I logged into Twitter the source of most evil and found out that V+ or CH+(?) will be airing behind-the-scenes episodes of their Wings Tour. Nothing new... except it is being marketed as dramatic reality TV. I'm not very comfortable with the idea of having their arguments and other personal issues, such Jungkook fainting, aired and monetized. The boys are entitled to their own selves, of course. I just feel like a mom who's trying to prevent her child from joining a horrid reality show.

What are your thoughts on this? I might just be overthinking it but it really does bother me... ",77,51

Or, stuff they've already done in Run that you'd like to see again.

Mine are:

1) Something involving kids and them having to look after kids. That would KILL ME. I'd love to see how they'd all be with kids, it'd be so cute.

2) We've had cooking so I want to see some baking now, or cake decorating or something along those lines.

3) Something involve art and crafts like painting or sculpting. They're all creative so it'd be cool to see what they could create, and probably funny as well. For a challenge it could be like painting eachother or something, idk.

I have some more but I'll leave it at that. What about you guys? ",75,94

There was a thread I saw on twitter (that I can't find, so if you saw it maybe you could link it) that compared various articles on BTS from around the world and how the media is pushing them in the respective country. Around the time that Hope World dropped, I remember seeing [a reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/81dnl2/entertalk_i_didnt_know_that_jhopes_individual/dv2r9wo/?context=1) in a thread that said that in China, apparently stan culture there is a lot more solo oriented, vs. how hardcore OT7 most international Army (and from what I've heard, Korean Army too) tend to be.

I know that there are so many Army from all over the world on here, so please share what you think.

This is basically number 100-125 on the Hot 100. Now, we usually see DNA as BTS' first entry into the charts, but if we consider the bubbling under, it's Spring Day. Charting at #15 on the bubbling under. Can this just be even more proof that Spring Day is amazing? I just made this post because it seems a lot of people don't realise this at all. Even Not Today, which did better on YT, didn't chart on bubbling under. 

That's part one of the post. Part two - BST.

BST barely got knocked off the bubbling under. After looking at streaming data, radio airplay (none), youtube streams (back when they were more relevant), and a couple of other things, I'll spare you the maths (Billboard used one weird formula back in late 2016), but basically, BST got #142 on the Hot 100, essentially #42 on the bubbling under. It got knocked off by 17 spots. Dang. Again, just wanted to let you guys know :)",1,53

&amp;nbsp;

Suga of BTS did special good deeds on his own birthday. Suga is getting birthday messages from many ARMYs all over the world for his 26th birthday on March 9th. In the middle of this, there were posts on online communities that Suga sent to multiple orphanages 10kg of 1++ Hanwoo (highest quality Korean native beef) with inspection certificate as well as signed CD of BTS. 

Big Hit Entertainment confirmed ""we know that Suga donated Hanwoo to 39 orphanages on March 9, his birthday, in the name of ARMY, the name of BTS' fans"". 

The story dates back to four years ago. Suga talked with fans in 2014 at a fan sign event celebrating their album release and told them he would buy them meat if he became to make a lot of money. Suga, who had never forgotten his promise to his fans, decided to make a meaningful donation with their fans on his 26th birthday. 

Big Hit also added ""It's hard for him to have a meat party with fans, so instead he donated not in his name but in the name of ARMY to express his gratitude for the fans.""

&amp;nbsp;

[Translation by /u/grk637 from here]

In recent years, members of BTS have been setting good examples by steadily doing good deeds. Previously, on Feb. 20th, Jimin sent personally signed albums to his juniors at Busans Hoedong Elementary School, following the schools very last graduation (school closed). Additionally, he gifted the schools graduates, entering junior high, with school uniforms. Founded in 1982, Hoedong Elementary school ended its 36 year history and closed their doors on this day. It has been revealed that on this day, Jimins father attended the graduation to relay the gifts and give a congratulatory speech.
 
At the time, BTSs representatives explained, (Jimins) Father expressed sadness about Hwaedong Elementary Schools closing before distributing [Jimins] gifts.
 
Good deeds, by the whole group, are continuous as well. Prior to the release of WINGS: YNWA, last January, it was revealed that they donated 100M Won to 416 Sewol Families (founded by the families of the victims and survivors of the Sewol tragedy). Each of the 7 members contributed 10M Won, with Big Hit contributing 30M Won, making up the 100M Won. The members personally made the decision and proceeded to donate quietly to 416 Sewol Families, with their contribution belatedly revealed through media coverage.
 
There is also long-term donations happening, together with their music. BTS and Big Hit Entertainment partnered with Unicef Korea for two years, starting last November, supporting Unicefs campaign to raise awareness of violence against children and youths worldwide (#ENDviolence). The new campaign combines their own social change campaign (LOVE MYSELF), prepared by BTS themselves with Unicefs #ENDviolence campaign.
 
BTS and Big Hit Entertainment established a Love Myself fund, donating 500M Won to Unicef Korea. They will continue to raise funds towards the ENDviolence campaign by contributing 3% of album sales of LOVE YOURSELF series over the course of 2 years, the total net profits from official campaign merchandise and general donations from the public. As of January 17 of last year, the accumulated funds exceeded 600M Won. In addition, 3% of the proceeds from album sales and the proceeds from official campaign merchandise since last December, will also be donated.
 
BTSs mini album LOVE YOURSELF: HER, released 9/18 of last year, stayed on the Billboard main album chart Billboard 200 for 18 weeks, as of Feb. 14 (local time). As of March 8th, according to Korean authorized music chart Gaon Chart, cumulative sales are recorded as 1,613,924 copies, the highest amount recorded on Gaon Chart, BTS making a new record.
 
On Feb 28th, at the 15th Korean Music Awards held in Seoul Guro Art Valley Theater, BTS received the award for Musicians of the Year. They are currently focused on working on a new album and comeback preparations.

But for your information, many kpop youtubers got copyright strikes and there are also already taken down. Mostly because they reacted to content by CJ&amp;EM mainly live performances like from mnet.

As Bang PD said in KBS good insight, kpop got a lot of exposure through youtube reactions. So, as like BTS is famous with live performances, I know that a lot of youtubers got suggested to react to BTS live performances. However, with the recent copyright strikes it may impact to BTS and kpop as a whole negatively and make youtuber who still new to kpop afraid to make any reaction to BTS and kpop as a whole. 

My suggestion is asking for bighit and other artists companies for buying copyright for live performances and post it at their own youtube channel so that no one get copyright strikes and still give more exposure for their artists. 

What do you guys think about it?",36,69

I was unsure as to whether or not this would be taken down for being repetitive, but I think I should give it a shot regardless. This is what I posted:

&gt; So I've listened to BTS' music since 2013, but never got the chance to enter the fandom/heavily invest in the boys till last September when LY:H just released. I regret having slept on them. I wish I could've been with them earlier and I still feel rather unworthy to call myself ARMY with the little things I've done (voting, streaming, clearing misconceptions about the group IRL and online, helping my other interested friends enlist), but I'm just as thankful to surround myself with my group of real life ARMY friends and the intellectuals on this page who care about all seven of them just as much as I do.

&gt; We've talked about BTS' future success with their influence on the world, them breaking records, Hope World releasing, being trendsetters and doing societal good, near relentlessly and with much vigour. But there's another side to their story. With old Twitter posts from them resurfacing, Bangtan Sub re-releasing their Debut Day episode (I can't bring myself to see Jin cry again ;-;) and ARMY going on a recent trip down memory lane, I'm curious to know the experiences of my more senior ARMY here...

&gt; What was it like to not be an *ARMY*, but to be a *Bangstan*?

&gt; By this, I'm talking about a time before Love Yourself, before Wings and HYYH. Before they had songs like DNA, Spring Day, BST, Dope and I Need U. Before they smashed charts, sold out concerts and took the world as their stage. What was it like to have stanned them since their debut/fetus/2 Cool 4 Skool era? When Rookie King or AHL was their latest show? When not a lot of people knew or had faith in them?

&gt; One thing I ask is that we don't start bringing up any needed drama. After all, this is about the ""past."" Those events have already concluded and I know that BTS and ARMY are in a much, much better place now! I've read news articles and old threads so I know *of* the kinds of experiences both they and you all had to go through but I'd still love to hear a your firsthand experiences, having seen it all through a different perspective.

&gt; How was it like following their journey early on? To listen to their old music back when it was their only music at the time? When they began to be nominated/win awards? Seeing the boys today, in what ways do you think they've grown? And how do you feel right now as you look back on the eras you shared with them? I would be honored if you could enlighten me ",44,98

394,2018-3-10,2018,3,10,17,83dwsg,"Which type of intelligence do you think each member exhibits most, which do you value, and which do you possess?",ABlackUnicorn,1520669149,"Hey everyone, 

I was pondering this just now and I thought it would be a fun discussion! I truly believe every single person is capable of displaying a certain type of intelligence, as I know that classic ""book smarts"" is not the only way to discern someone's intellect. 

[Here](https://blog.adioma.com/9-types-of-intelligence-infographic/) is a great blog that explains what many believe are the 9 different types of intelligence. Please take a look at it for a greater understanding of each type! Listed with the short descriptors, they are: 

1) **Naturalist** (understanding living things and reading nature)

2) **Musical** (discerning sounds, their pitch, tone, rhythm, and timbre)

3) **Logical-Mathematical** (quantifying things, making hypotheses, and proving them)

4) **Existential** (tackling the questions of why we live, and why we die)

5) **Interpersonal** (sensing people's feelings and motives)

6) **Bodily-Kinesthetic** (coordinating your mind with your body)

7) **Linguistic** (finding the right words to express what you mean)

8) **Intra-personal** (understanding yourself, what you feel, and what you want)

9) **Spatial** (visualizing the world in 3D)

I was thinking a lot about each member's type of intelligence, as I do often. Here's what I think each member exhibits:

***JIMIN***: I fell for Jimin initially and he was my ultimate bias for awhile because I believe he exhibits Interpersonal intelligence the most strongly. He always seems to be in tune with the members and what they need emotionally- they have often stated that everyone talks to him when they need a listening ear. Upon realizing this about him, it felt natural to me to stan him, lol. Personally, I've always valued emotional/interpersonal intelligence most- I think people who are gifted with the ability to empathize greatly and to articulate emotions are so powerful. 

***TAEHYUNG***: This is one of a couple that took me awhile to parse out, but I feel that Tae also displays a keen Interpersonal intelligence that looks different from Jimin's brand. I don't speak Korean, so I don't know if the way Taehyung speaks is what comforts others. I think it goes deeper than that, and it's his mere presence that is of great comfort to the people he cares about. I have to imagine that only people with great Interpersonal intelligence can connect so immediately and wholesomely with every single child that comes their way! Furthermore, he is *the* social butterfuly and also seems quite sensitive to the moods of others. 

***JIN***: Jin is so interesting to me, because while I don't think he spends time trying to answer life's big questions (I think he's more of a ""live your life in each moment"" kind of person), I do think he's *super* savvy and clever. I believe he displays an acute Intrapersonal intelligence. The link above describes it: ""Intra-personal intelligence is the capacity to understand oneself and ones thoughts and feelings, and to use such knowledge in planning and directing ones life. Intra-personal intelligence involves not only an appreciation of the self, but also of the human condition."" Jin seems like that one friend we all have who has his shit together at all times. He seems extremely self-motivated, ambitious, and makes it look easy- it's apparent he knows exactly what he's good at and what he's got to offer the world because he knows himself very, very well. 

***YOONGI***: I think that it's fairly easy to conclude that Yoongi displays Musical intelligence. I think it's fair to say that he seems to have a very fine-tuned ""ear"", perhaps more so than anyone else. His passion for music seems second to none in his life, and it's kind of hard to imagine that he could have been anything other than the genius musician/composer/producer that he is.

***JUNGKOOK***: I think this one is also pretty straightforward for me. I think Jungkook displays Kinesthetic/Bodily intelligence for sure. Yes, he is athletic, and doesn't like to sit still, and loves to ""do"" all the things. But I think it goes deeper than that. I think Jungkook has such a deep understanding of and connection to his body, and that is what enables his ability to be skilled in nearly everything he ever seems to try. He knows just when to push and pull his body. It's honestly fascinating and beautiful to watch in action. 

***HOBI***:  You guys...I have no clue. I literally have no idea what to think. I can't make up my mind at all! I want to know all of your opinions on every member anyway, but y'all are gonna have to help me out especially with Hobi because ***he is an enigma***. 

***NAMJOON***: I think Namjoon displays very classic type(s) of intellect, that people recognize immediately and give credence to. I think he possesses both Verbal/Linguistic and Existential intelligence. This is the same guy who in 5th grade wrote a *beautiful* poem about the hopeful reunification of Korea. The person that everyone says speaks ""prettily"". The kind who, in response to being teased for not having dance skills during Ggul FM said ""People in heaven should think about should think about what it's like to be in hell"". ***Dude***, lol. But that's just who he naturally is! And it's really fascinating to see him use this gift. I love my bias :)
________

Okay, so that's the end of my long ass post! I really want to know all of your opinions on each member, of course! ***And please don't forget to mention which intelligence you value and which you think you possess!*** Using [this test](http://www.literacynet.org/mi/assessment/findyourstrengths.html), I scored highest for Intrapersonal intelligence, which was a surprise to me! Verbal/Linguistic, Musical, and Interpersonal were all tied for 2nd highest, and honestly that makes a lot of sense to me, what with my highkey obsession with music and background in playing classical guitar, love of writing and all manners of communicating ideas, and general love of connecting with others in an emotionally compelling manner. I'd like to know about you all as well :)",20,108

How are the fandoms different/similar?,Bex917,1520730846,"I think there's been a lot of discussion about how Bts is different/similar to other kpop groups, but now that Bts have expanded into a global act I wanted to ask how people think they compare to their international rivals.

To preface, I don't have anything against Western boy bands or their fans. The fact that Bts are more technically impressive  than their Western counterparts is obvious, but that doesn't mean that the fame of a group like One Direction or a more nontraditional boy band like Brockhampton is illegitimate or undeserved, and I don't  think that Bts is inherently better or more mature than any of these groups either.

That said, I've never been a fan of a Western boy band or pop act before, so I don't have the information to compare Bts to them. I know that a lot of Armys are former fans of Western groups and artists, so I wanted to ask a couple of questions.

* How does Bts compare? How are they similar/different compared to Western acts?
* What is it about Bts that's so attractive to  fans of Western artists? 
* How do you think the fandoms compare? Both in demographic and structure, I'm curious to know the differences 
   between a Western fandom and a kpop fandom (specifically Armys in this case) because kpop and Western acts 
    promote so differently.
* Why do you think Armys are so much more engaged and organized compared to most Western fandoms?

432,2018-3-12,2018,3,12,9,83r0ow,A Review of Various BTS Collaboration Products,penguinsderp,1520814990,"As I'm sitting in bed browsing reddit with a BT21 cushion under each arm and a Mediheal mask on my face, I've decided it's probably time to take stock of just *how* many BTS collaboration-related things I've ended up acquiring and do a review of sorts on them ~~and reflect~~. My hope is that someone who reads this can find takeaways and possibly be less impulsive with their money than I have been as a result.

[](#v_ded)

##[MEDIHEAL X BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHlWeeJjPc)

I use sheet masks a fair amount since living in Korea, but I've only ever stuck with Innisfree's (mostly because they often sold a 10 for $10 type deal). I was pretty curious to try other ones, especially to see if these would feel any different and be worth their price tag.

The Mediheal and BTS mask packs come in four packages geared towards four different skin concerns: hydrating, brightening, moisture barrier, and soothing the skin. I bought one in a store on impulse (thinking I wouldn't see it elsewhere) before realizing they were available on Amazon, so the two I ended up getting were moisture barrier and skin soothing. ~~I might get the other two packs later on.~~ These two suit my skin needs at the moment because there's been a lot of wind that dries out my face recently.

Together, these two packages contain the [tea tree, AC dressing ampoule, and proatin masks](https://i.imgur.com/1hCv3y5.jpg). Each mask was put in the fridge beforehand and applied in the late evening for 20 minutes.

In general, my experience with Mediheal and these masks has been great! If youre really concerned with skincare, I think this is worth giving a shot. And I think of all the BTS collab stuff thats meant to provide some additional cosmetic benefit, this is the most worth your money.

###Tea Tree Care Solution Essential Mask

The usual mask I use is Innisfree's green tea and tea tree masks, so I gravitated to this mask first. It's meant to ""relax glossy, sensitive skin, take care of wide pores, and moisturize"". It contains tea tree oil, chamomile, and centella Asiatica extract.

One of the first things I noticed is that it had a really nice fresh, almost spearmint herbal scent. It feels really cool and light, and is really refreshing on the skin. I have in my notes that the mask tingled a bit with drier skin, but I have it on now after having moisturized and washed up and I didn't experience the same thing.

There's definitely a lot more liquid in the masks than what I'm used to using, which is good! The mask itself didn't feel immediately dry after using it for the longest recommended amount, and there's still enough for the face to absorb once the mask has been removed. These feel like a very general-use mask, so I can see why theyre in each of the four packages.

###D:NA Proatin Mask

This mask advertises that it will prevent moisture loss with skin-barrier protein for soft and dewy skin, and is made with DNA along with sodium hyaluronate, Aquaxyl, and sodium PCA.

I was a little wary about this one because its a really thick, viscous liquid and I have historically equated that with inevitable breakouts. I also associate that with will smell gross, so I was happy to be proven wrong by this one. Kind of smells like shampoo, almost? Theres a flap on this mask that covers the top lip for added moisture. It definitely feels like a much thicker emulsion rather than how most masks feel like a thin/light essence, so if you dont like that feeling on your face, this may not be one to get.

But I am happy to report with this one that not only was the dryness of my skin lessened the next morning, but also no breakouts!

###P.D.F AC Dressing Ampoule Mask

This mask says that it will relax tired and sensitive skin and manages healthy and moisturized skin condition. It contains Centella Asiatica extract, Trehalose, and Allantoin to achieve this.

Thismight be my new favorite. It smells a bit medicinal herb-like (which probably some people wont like), but it feels like it continually stays cool and feels the most refreshing as you wear it. Like the tea tree mask, theres still a lot of essence after the 20 minute mark and that refreshing feeling stays after youve taken the mask off. It actually feels like it warms up a bit after youve taken the mask off and let it sit. Overall, I really like this one a lot and will probably be buying these ones again.

##[VT X BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7lwogdDv8c)

I'm going to go ahead and give the warning that this section has many photos of my face. Whether this is a warning for you or for me, I'm still not sure. But let's go!

For reference: I have combination skin, with an oily T-zone and recently some dry patches on my cheeks, jawline, and around my mouth due to the wind. Some of my go-to foundation shades that match me at varying points in the year are MAC NC25, Make Up For Ever 125, and Too Faced Light Beige ([comparison swatches here](https://i.imgur.com/S6afITT.jpg)). I also took a bunch of pictures over the past few weeks since getting this, but it seems the majority of the best quality/well-lit photos are mostly from the one ""stress test"" day where I wore it for 16 hours. The shirts usually a good giveaway if it's not.

Before BTS, the thing I obsessed over was makeup, so I was really excited for this. I got the white pact, which is meant for Moisturizing / Shining / Natural Makeup with collagen and red berry essence.

First, some good things. I like the packaging and the way the makeup looks. [Packaging is well-constructed](https://i.imgur.com/lnhtuC8.jpg) and I dont feel like its going to break on me before the makeup runs out (*Laneige*). The stickers make for some [real cute customization](https://i.imgur.com/Si7Hx44.jpg). I also really like that of all the shade 23s available in Korean cosmetics, this seems to be the one that has matched me the best. And I tried close to all of them during my time in Korea soI appreciate that.

[](#jin_wut)

I also like the way it initially looks. [You can see](https://i.imgur.com/1dxdhJ0.jpg) that although this ones lighter coverage, it still evens out the skin and covers anything really small. I can imagine the black pact will have even more coverage. Im a fan of dewy looks too, so I thought this looked really nice.

If only it stayed that way: Ive been reading a lot of reviews on Amazon that mostly highlight the positives of how it looks upon application, but not much after. I think the best way to describe my experience is that the formula of the cushion is very slippery and doesnt really adhere well to itself, which isodd for a cushion thats meant to be reapplied. You could make the argument that cushion makeup is not meant to be long-wearing because of this, but Ive found that both the foundation routine (skincare, primer, powder, setting spray) and the cushion routine (skincare, cushion, occasional touch-ups throughout the day) yielded similar results anyway. I also do know that I personally have more difficulty with the cake-like compacts versus the more liquid compacts, but there were some issues with this that I didnt experience with other cake-like compacts Ive tried.

This slippery formula causes a few issues. Close to any light contact with my face causes some of it to inevitably come off, whether thats from tapping an itch on my face, eating, or strands of hair caught by the wind (and good luck with rain). Theres also the fact that over time, it emphasizes texture and drier patches on my face ([here, its along my jawline](https://i.imgur.com/KFdz2FU.jpg)). Finally, anywhere your face muscles move and the lines coming from that will experience a lot of creasing ([probably super visible here around my nose and lips](https://i.imgur.com/OVfqsQm.jpg)). Granted, that photos from hour 11 of wearing it, but even a lower-quality front-facing camera can pick up those same lines despite touch-ups from earlier than [hour 5](https://i.imgur.com/JDSUaRe.jpg).

I do wear glasses so Im not going to fault the lines from my glasses making contact with my nose and cheeks because those will happen no matter what. But anywhere else where glasses dont make contact, Id rather the makeup stay where it is.

And reapplying doesnt really seem to help too much either: even with blotting off excess oil beforehand, it just seems like the makeup already on your face will have broken down/dissolved to the point of accelerating the fading of future applications, or at least reacting poorly to it. I really dont put on a lot when I do touch-ups, but you can see in that hour 11 photo that reapplication can pill and collect in a weird way on the face. This isnt a problem Ive had with other cushions either.

So dry skin gets emphasized, oily skin breaks it down, differing priming and setting methods dont really change this, and touching up exacerbates things. All things considered, I probably will keep using it just because it still looks okay if youre not hyper-zoomed in like I have been for this review ([hour 16 including two plane flights and rain ~~and hangover skin troubles~~](https://i.imgur.com/aeVIeuk.jpg)) and dont need super flawless makeup for a ridiculously long time. Creasing isnt the biggest deal in the world for me eitherespecially with cushion makeup, since foundations more suitable if you want set in place makeup anyway. But, I do know now that Ill have to work with this a little harder when I do wear it. If longevity is an important aspect of face makeup to you, keep these things in mind because $40+ aint cheap.

[Oh, the posters nice, too.](https://i.imgur.com/p1oX5rm.jpg)

##[PUMA X BTS COURTSTAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74iN7Sil2DA)

I got the [shoelace hoodie](https://i.imgur.com/JgPls5w.jpg) since I wanted to get something *relatively* inexpensive from the collection (though considering the cold where I am, perhaps a thicker coat would have been a better option). The shoelace hoodie is kind of thin, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something to keep you warm. That being said, [I find that it does fit pretty well](https://i.imgur.com/nm324T0.jpg) and it looks nice. It also isn't awkwardly tight around anywhere in an unflattering way...with one exception. The neck is sewn incredibly tight and doesn't have a lot of give, so it's even difficult to pull the hoodie on over your head.

My dad kind of made fun of me for being one of those fans that buys something with bad quality just because of the face, and he was probably right in this specific case. Knowing all that, I probably wouldn't get *this* item again. There's hoodies that have a similar style while also keeping you warmer and fitting over your head better. I kind of just wear this as a stylized shirt at this point.

##[LINE X BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg66VaZTyOI)

These are less things with utility and more things you get because theyre cute and collectible so I wont really go too in-depth here. Just some observations:

- They have the sizing measurements on Amazon, but I can also attest that the shirt sizes are pretty equivalent to US unisex shirts (if not a bit roomier).
- The smaller cushions are the ones you want if you want to hug and cuddle them (I have RJ and Van). The larger size cushions are really big and can probably act more like full-size pillows.
- The plush keychains are really *really* cute. Holy crap, Ive been taking RJ with me everywhere.
- From what Ive read and seen (dont actually have one), some of the standing dolls dont really stand well on their own despite the name, or have a difficult time doing so.
- The LAMY pen set comes with both cartridges and a manual inkwell mechanism, which is really nice since I do use fountain pens and have ink already. It comes with the Safari pen, which has a small nib and writes really well for everyday use (good, because thats its intention). Im really glad it came with that one and not one of the more calligraphy-focused pens since Ive noticed fibers tend to get stuck more frequently with the wider LAMY nibs (especially if youre stressed and write with a lot of pressure like I kind of do). I feel like this deal is a better set for those who are already into fountain pens and regularly use them rather than someone trying to get into it for the first time.

Finally: I really have bought a lot of stuff, and a lot more stuff than I really need. I want to emphasize that I do make enough money to allow myself these things, and **I would not be buying these things if I did not**. And I think thats important to be grounded in that fact when all these advertisements and collabs are being shoved into your face and tempting you to collect everything. I do want to show that even with BTSs face on products, people are all different and not all collab products are going to be universally perfect or life-changing. Theres definitely things here that I would not have bought if I knew what it would be like, and theres definitely collabs that Im just not as interested in.

Always be responsible with the money you have and know your limits. I think we all knew that, but the reminder never hurts.

Anyway, I hope some of you found this at least a little interesting! I have a tendency to write a *lot*, so if you made it all the way through this, props.",11,168

Soooooooo I noticed that they only say ""BTS"" is coming whereas for JiHope's other Japanese appearances, they stated that ""J-Hope and Jimin of BTS"" (or ""J-Hope, Jimin and V of BTS"") were coming. 

My paranoid ARMY mind is vacillating between these 3 options:

* This is just early announcements &amp; soon they'll clarify that it's JiHope(Tae?) again.

* All 7 members managed to sneak away to Japan &amp; they prerecorded this interview.

* All members are going to Japan 1.5 weeks before Face Yourself is released.

(PS: It's my first post; please be gentle.)

COMEBACK GOALS TIME.

Yeah, I just made that up.  Anyway, we need to set some goals for this next comeback. We should take into consideration YouTube views, Korea/American Chart performance, Spotify, Radio play, a bunch of things. Since DNA got up to 300M views so far, I'm going to say that their title track is going to hit 400M just as fast. That's a goal that I want to complete.

Any ideas?",71,93

&amp;nbsp;

*[Translation]*

CONTINUE, a social enterprise, recently had an amazing experience. It started off a fundraising campaign on Naver Happy Bean with a somewhat unfamiliar title, a company that tailors hope with leather from disused car. The company ended up raising 14 times original funding goal.

The reason was simple. The bag was in the pictures posted by RM of BTS when he traveled Europe at the end of last year. RM took pictures at European attractions such as Interlaken and Florence, and in the train while wearing or holding the bag. Of course, it was not intended. It was just a bag that RM carried around during his trip.

Whenever RM posted his picture on Twitter, the fans looked closely at every single photo and then paid attention to the bag RM was wearing. They then learned that there was a social enterprise that upcycles materials such as leather seat, seat belt, and air bag (that are usually discarded without being recycled) to produce bags or wallets. In addition to purchasing bags, they naturally continued to support the social enterprise. 

According to SK Innovation on the 11th, CONTINUE was introduced on Naver Happy Bean as a company that tailors hope with leather from disused car on January 25th. The original funding goal was 3M Won, but in just two days it raised 30M Won (1000% of the original goal). By the end of fundraising period, the company had raised 43.42M Won in 40 days (1447% of the original goal). 

Meanwhile, about half of the employees of CONTINUE are comprised of vulnerable groups such as women with career breaks and North Korean defectors. The company contributes to reducing 4M tons of landfill wastes and saving 1,642 liters of water per bag. SK Innovation, LG, and Kia Motors are sponsoring CONTINUE.

I reached out a couple weeks ago looking for volunteers to be on a podcast about what it means to love BTS and the subculture of the fandom. I was blown away by your kindness and helpfulness. 

Per your recommendation, we spoke with BTS Translations (Twitter: @bts_trans) to learn about all the hard work fans put into translating. 

I still have so many questions so I might be following up with those of you who volunteered originally. 

Not trying to self-promote but a few of you asked for the episode to be posted, so here it goes. Hope you enjoy! I gave you a shoutout- if you couldnt tell, I loooove this Reddit group!

&amp;nbsp;

**Have you found yourself becoming more open to trying out new music?**

&amp;nbsp;

**Has your playlist changed since BTS?**

&amp;nbsp;

For me, I initially didn't like BTS songs like Fire or the Cyphers (yeah I was terrible..... TT). But I liked BTS, so I wanted to give all of their songs / rest of the album a chance. I listened to the albums several times over and now I love Fire / the Cyphers. I did this with the rest of their albums. I still don't love all their songs but I like/love most of them.

&amp;nbsp;

I had the same experience with Love Yourself: Her. I initially only liked a few songs but listened to the entire album several times and like the other songs a lot more now than I did before.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm still in the process of listening to more non-BTS songs, but whenever BTS does a cover or I see a recommendation pop up, I'm more inclined to at least try it out even if I haven't heard of the artist before. I don't spend the same amount of time/effort re-listening to songs I don't initially like, but I'm finding that I generally listen to the entire song or even a few times compared to before when I listened to the first 10 seconds or so.",79,71

You can see what I have available [here](https://imgur.com/a/XLy73). Payment would be through Paypal. I'm thinking $10 per photocard and $8 for the group postcard. I can't say what the shipping cost would be since it depends on your location. If you don't want to pay for shipping I can wrap the card up in a bit of paper or plastic, put the wrapped photocard in a thank you card and send the thank you card through the mail in a regular letter envelope. In my opinion this will probably be sufficient but it's up to you. If you're willing to pay the shipping fee I would of course package your card in a bubble mailer with some cardboard so it doesn't get bent and plenty of bubble wrap.

As you all may know, there is an upcoming collaboration between BTS and YouTube Red concerning the release of their new docuseries, ""Burn The Stage."" Following its announcement, ARMY began losing their collective shit (as we always do) and are currently in the state of purchasing a YouTube Red subscription- Unless you're like me, who is weeping silently in a country that doesn't have YouTube Red. However, I remember how in the beginning, everyone hated the idea of YouTube Red. The premise of a subscription service to access premium content, with the subcription-based content market already swarmed by players like Netflix, Spotify, etc., angered viewers who didn't want to spend any more money on monthly subscriptions. Those people (and there were *a lot* of them) openly voiced their concerns and have vowed not to buy into the service. Now in 2018, look at them now. So the fact of the matter got me thinking...

The Midas Touch is a well-known parable in Ovis' *Metamorphoses*. King Midas, a vain and troublesome ruler of the kingdom of Phrygia, lived a life of luxury and pleasure within the palace walls. After nursing a drunk satyr who turns out to be a disciple of Dionysus (Greek god of wine, theatre and unrestrained ecstasy), the god offered Midas one wish. Unsatisfied with his current wealth, he asked for the ability to turn anything he touched into gold. He went into a frenzy and turned his entire palace into gold, every pillar, instrument and furnishing. However, he could not eat nor sleep for his food, water and bed turned to solid gold as well. His daughter came to console him, but she turned to gold, too. Regretting what he had done, Midas asked Dionysus to undo the wish. After washing his hands in the River Pactolus, his power faded and everything went back to normal.

Despite how broke we say we are, as a collective, ARMY has *considerable* buying power; if a product or service is in some way, shape or form related to the boys, our purchasing decisions are immediately influenced towards it. Who here hasn't once thought about buying a pair of Timberland's 6-Inch Premium Waterproof Boots, Issue 5 of the Billboard Magazine or Nivea Fruity Shine Peach-flavoured Lip Balm? These aren't even being advertised by them. On the other side, anyone or anything that BTS is associated with now gets a lot of (good or bad) notoriety and following overnight. Line Friends, PUMA, MEDIHEAL, the Love Myself campaign, Tinashe, Roy Kim, John Cena, Wale, the countless artists, cover singers, musicians and YouTube reactors... I know there are even more associations than this. At this point in time, it doesn't matter if BTS reached out to them or they reached out to BTS. Even if they don't know you exist, an indirect link with the group is enough to result in more hits, more followers and more popularity (or infamy).

Just as how King Midas turned everything he touched into an object of insurmountable wealth, the Bangtan Touch is the growing phenomenon where, intentionally or unintentionally, anything BTS involves themselves with quickly becomes sought after despite prior sentiments towards it, and anyone who chooses to associate themselves with BTS quickly finds themselves in high volumes of traffic and an audience from not just the ARMY, but by various mainstream and social media outlets in South Korea and internationally. Through a rather quick analysis, the two main factors I believe that is causing this event include BTS' sphere of influence expanding exponentially after winning the Top Social Artist Award at the BBMAs (arguable even earlier than that) and ARMY's rather reverent and intense brand loyalty towards the boys.

Now this raises certain ethical questions for fans. The reason why the Bangtan Touch exists ultimately ends up on our hands as consumers and major influencers. What do we do with this power, moving forward? How do we deal with groups or individuals who are are associating themselves with BTS solely to become more popular? Can we even detect this type of deception? How do we sustain the potency of the Bangtan Touch to further support the group? What boundaries will we set ourselves so that we draw a personal line between supporting our boys and frivolous and impulsive spending habits?

Just because I'm a marketing student doesn't mean I'm business-savvy, I'm inquisitive but only know the basics lol. I've been planning to write up a full SWOT analysis on BTS' success, and BigHit's to an extent as soon as the college semester is over and posting it up here for review. I'd love to know your insights, concerns and any other formal/informal associations with BTS I may have missed.",54,184

Hi! I wanted to post about an event that's going to happen on twitter next week on March 24th - BTS ARMY Culture Day. It's a project aimed to show and celebrate diversity in the fandom as recently there's been tension due to these reasons. I'd love to hear what everyone on here thinks (and also participate if you're on twitter) about this initiative. 

I'll share below the text that's on the official poster for this project, but if you'd like to check out the account for this you can find them @armyxculture. 

***
ARMY x Culture Day 

Hello ARMYs all over the world, it's time to rise and shine! We're preparing this project to show and celebrate diversity among the fandom. It's beyond race, skin colour, gender, or beliefs. It's about cultural diversity and individuality across countries and continents. The concept of this project is to showcase the beauty of vast diversity across the world and how wonderful it is. 

Let's get past the pointless misunderstandings and miscommunication due to cultural differences and barriers. We believe we should celebrate cultural diversity instead of making it a boundary. 

You can participate in the CULTURE DAY celebration in any way you want. Be it traditional clothes or fashion, food, landscape, landmarks, neighbourhoods, historical events, traditions, festivals, arts, music, literature, cultural or religious beliefs, stereotypes, misconceptions, a glimpse of your everyday life - we trust ARMYs creativity, imagination, and judgement to create wonderful posts! 

To those who are multicultural or feel like they don't belong to any culture, remember it's about individuality. You're free to celebrate however you want to. 

Also, it doesn't necessarily have to be visual, you can just talk about it if you don't feel like posting pictures. 

The motive is to share and learn from each other. Let's appreciate each other more. Let's break away from ignorance, prejudice, and hate. 

ARMY is an unbelievably diverse fandom. We hope that we can unite more through this project. Let's be better. Let's do better.

#BTSARMYCultureDay

I know the english i-fandom isn't very familiar with c-armys but I was lurking on baidu bar today and I wanted to share some of the nicknames. first, here are the full, proper Chinese names. Usually theyre the same as the hanja, but some are different for some reason.

**RM:  (jin nnjn)**

**Jin:  (jin xizheng)**

- that's the name I get when I google his hanja name but I see more c-armys use  (jin shuzhen)

**Suga:  (min yunji)**

- I see it more as  (min yunq)

**J-hope:  (zhng hoxi)**

**Jimin:  (pio zhmin)**

**V:  (jin tiheng)**

**JK:  (tin zhenggo)**




Ok, now a lot of the nicknames come from puns because Chinese is a language with many homophones or near-homophones. ~~I sadly cant type in the tone markings so the near-homophones will look the same~~ I can type in some tone markings lol (just not 1st or 3rd tones..)

**RM:  (jin nnjn)**

-  (jnjn): basically repeating a word makes a name cute hehe

-  (lamng): it comes from rapmon with a Chinese accent. sorry RM, but rapmon aint dying anytime soon

-  (jin duzhang): kim leader



**Jin:  (jin shuzhen)**

-  (dge): eldest hyung

-  (jia mngne): fake maknae

- I cant find any pun-related nicknames for him? which is a pity considering hes the pun master



**Suga:  (min yunq)**

-  (tngtang): sugar x2 (so sweet and cute)

-  (tng y): lord sugar

-  (min y): lord min



**j-hope:  (zhelng haxi)**

-  (hobi)

- I dont know??? ~~why cant I think of more Im upset~~



**jimin:  (pio zhmin)**

-  (jimi): literally means chicken rice

-  (minmin)

- *insert any type of cute squishy dessert*



**v:  (jin taheng)**

-  (tata)

- there are more but I can't remember

- yeontan also goes by  (heitn  black coal..~~I think thats what yeontan means too?~~) and  (tnerthe er is added to the end of nouns to make them sound cute)

- kind of random but taekook is sometimes  (zhngta) which is a term that means pretty/handsome little boy



**jk:  (tin zhenggo)**

-  (zhengguo): it means steam pot lol (the kind you use to make steamed buns and such)

-  (guoguo): lit. fruit

-  (tzi guo): bunny kookie

-  (guo y): lord guo/kookie/fruit

-  (hungjin mngne): golden maknae

- sugakookie is  (tng guo) which means candy

- ~~gosh everyone dotes on the maknae and calls him cute things~~



also some extra trivia:

- bangtan is sometimes called  (pngdn) which means fat egg (should be  fngdn)

- bighit is  (d hei) which means big black but the black (hei) is supposed to sound like hit

this is super messy because halfway through, I realized that I'm not going to finish my work today but I still continued writing this lol",63,287

BTS do well on the music charts but they have never gotten an PAK or been able to be #1 for a long period of time. I thought Spring Day would be their song to get them that PAK.

What kind of song would it take for BTS to get their gee, cheer up or growl? I think their songs are perfect and it frustrates me when me that they cant get one lol

Are idols from big companies like ikon and girl groups the only ones that can get them?

The first member I started being interested was Jin, but I always wasnt sure who he was in music videos! Later I found out that the person I had been staring at the whole time in Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears; that I thought was Jin, turned out to actually be Jungkook! 
So. 
1. Were there any members you often confused between when you first joined the fandom? 
2. Are there any members you sometimes are unsure of/mistake for another person? 
Sometimes I find myself double-guessing silhouettes or far away photos of the boys; seem to be able to see Suga, Jhope and V in the same person! (Goodness knows why, they each look so different).

Ive seen the series twice now with a lot of skips in the second time. I didnt hate it but was not my favorite. I appreciate that we got to see BTS in moments where they had to deal with real stuff in work, music, and artistry. I think it showed their good character pass the idol image. ",152,97

My name is Ashleigh and during my spring break, next week, I will be in NYC for two days. During these two days I will be stopping off at LINE to grab some BT21 items

What can I order?
You can order as much stuff with as many characters. I will be periodically going to the store through out my day. Hopefully by doing this I can get more items and more items of the same character. However, since BT21 is in high demand (as we all probably know) I may not be able to get all of your items. If this is the case I will give you a full refund

How much is shipping?
I will not know until I have the orders back at my house and take weight and measurements. I will say if your order is big in size or heavy it will be more expensive. The price can also go up depending how far away you live from Pennsylvania. However, this should not be very expensive.

How do I get updates?
I will be giving updates on items and payments on my Twitter @1yuriharu1 so I do suggest if you order with me to follow my Twitter. This is so you can stay up on all updates of this order

When will this close?
This closes on March 26 (Monday) this is the day before I will go to NYC.

I you still have any questions you can leave them in the comments, dm me on Twitter (@1yuriharu1), pm me on here or email me at asnow7893@gmail.com.

I hope we can all get our goods and support BTS I a lol of their endeavors!~

Have a nice day!~~ :)

My name is Ashleigh and I will be hosting a group order for the 2018 May Japanese magazines. The payment deadlines for some magazines will vary and so will prices. I am from the USA, but willing to ship internationally.

The magazines are Jelly, ViVi, CanCam, EXILE, S-Cawaii!, and More magazine. Some of these do not have payment deadlines as I do not know how long they will be on sale.

If you have never joined a group order I will explain it to you. 
There are 3 payments. Goods, shipping and domestic.
- The goods is what we youre ordering. In this case the magazine.
- The second payment is shipping. This is the shipping from my seller in Japan to me. The cost of this will be split evenly amping the buyers. 
- The third and final payment is domestic. This payment is from me to you. 

One thing to note is I do not know the cost of the shipping or domestic payment. This is because I have no idea how heavy the magazines are. For domestic I will say I most likely will use the flat rate shipping for USPS. 

For international buyers it will be more expensive. The heavier the goods and farther you are from the USA means the cost will go up. Again I will not know the amount until I have the magazine on hand with me and mail them out.

If you do order with me I suggest you follow my Twitter @/1yuriharu1. This is because I will post updates on the orders and payments on Twitter. 

If you have any questions you can always ask me here on reddit, my Twitter @/1yuriharu1 or my email asnow7893@gmail.com

Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you if you join my order. I hope we can all support both ARMYs and BTS in the future!~

A family friend's daughter (she's only 4) knows that I love BTS but she always calls them ""PJS"" and tbh I love the new name.

My best friend's mom was listening as I was gushing about K-pop but she somehow thinks it's called ""B-Bop"" and I mentioned that the idols are sometimes too busy to see their parents/family and so she was scandalized thinking that the B-Bop idols were banned from seeing their parents hahah.

My mom knows about BTS but for awhile she called them TBS with the tone as if it was a news show acronym and she claimed that she couldn't tell them apart (but somehow always pointed out Jin as her favorite visual) 

Anyways, I hope this is allowed and I look forward to hearing some cute little stories :) ",119,117

732,2018-3-21,2018,3,21,4,85vq41,180321 Interview with a venture capitalist who made an early stage investment in Big Hit,diminie,1521575196,"Original title: An interview with Kim Joongdong of SV Investment who earned 108 Billion Won after investing 4 Billon Won in the agency of BTS

Source: http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=001&amp;oid=025&amp;aid=0002806478

&amp;nbsp;

SV Investment made an independent investment of 3B Won in 2011, and made an additional investment of 1B Won later, inviting three other investment companies to invest 1B Won each. The total estimated repayment (calculated at the end of last year) is 108B Won, and he believes the actual realized profits will be greater. 

&amp;nbsp;

This article is in the economy section, and the focus is of course not on BTS. I only translated two Q&amp;As where he talks about how he decided to make the initial investment. 

--------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

Q. Wasn't it that Bang PD requested you first for the investment?

A. No, I came to him first. They were a small, newborn company. Before I joined SV Investment, I used to work for Loen as the head of strategic planning. The name 'Bang Si-hyuk' was well-known in the industry. I'm not sure whether I can talk about this, but he was well-known for his ability to repay thanks to his top-notch producing skills. Investment in entertainment industry can be understood as a support for producing costs. Although it's a sort of debt, there were a lot of cases where people demand more funding without paying back the debt. So when I decided to make an investment in this industry, he was the first person that came to my mind. Of course, I had not even seen him for once. I only knew his name.

&amp;nbsp;

Q. So you based your investment decision on people.

A. It was before BTS debuted, so the current members were trainees. When we made the decision, we thoroughly examined their reputation. They were well-known even among trainees. I asked about them to people who worked with Bang PD, distributors, and trainees in other companies. I personally have had a respect for producers and people in the industry and I have enjoyed interacting with the. So I asked them if I could meet their son or talked to their daughter on the phone to ask them about the trainees that Bang PD was raising. In addition, Big Hit's system of raising choreographers and composers was different. It was not like a real estate agency, so to say, where they bring in a famous figure and operate a project. They would bring in people with great potential and grow with them. I thought that's where the competitive power of this company arises.

&amp;nbsp;

We've successfully finished the [birthday projects](https://imgur.com/a37gEuG), as well as the 2017 subreddit census. The books have been sent to BigHit last March 14th. We've opted for a hardcover census book this year, since it's our last physical book for the boys.^:c

### **[Here's a video of the finished books](https://youtu.be/HaUlx_uLsKM)!** (J-Hope's, Suga's, and the Census)

#BIRTHDAY PROJECTS

Our birthday messages &amp; art have been compiled into softcover photo books. **J-Hope's book** (44 pages) had a *sunshine* theme, where we shared things that cheered us up, while **Suga's book** (52 pages) had a *dreams* theme, where we shared things that inspired us.

As our gift to SOPE, the subreddit has raised **$168.50 USD** for the [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), BTS' joint project with UNICEF. Thank you to everyone who participated and donated!

&amp;nbsp;

#2017 CENSUS UPDATE

Last December 2017, we conducted the annual r/bangtan census. **Although the finished book has already been sent to BigHit, the Projects Team is still finalizing the digital copy and the full results of the census.** We appreciate your patience and ask that you kindly wait a little bit more for the complete output.

**We'd also like to know if you would be interested in purchasing a copy of the census!** 100% of the proceeds will go to the 5th anniversary donation for the #LoveMyself campaign. [Here's an interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaSuJ0YWGbjSjz562FOts_XhLoKvewpmIz3sYfK9nBrDf3ag/viewform?usp=sf_link) with the estimated costs and shipping fees. We ask that you answer only if you're genuinely interested in purchasing a copy. We'll be releasing the digital version soon, so you can also wait for that to browse and see if you'd like to get a physical copy.

#UPCOMING PROJECTS

**5th ANNIVERSARY PROJECT &amp; ARMY MUSTSERVE** | Since BTS announced that they will no longer be accepting gifts, we're planning on a different kind of philanthropic initiative. You guys know how BTS holds annual gatherings for ARMY called 'Muster'? For 2018, we'll be launching a new initiative geared towards acts of charity and community service called ARMY MustServe. In a nutshell, we're encouraging ARMY to support charities and/or participate in community service in BTS' name and share their experiences. We're still fleshing out the details, so if you have any ideas or suggestions, we'd love to hear about them!

&amp;nbsp;

---

Again, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who participated in the J-Hope, Suga, and Census projects, especially to those who made their donations. A special shoutout to the lovely u/AverageAnnie for receiving the books in Korea and sending them on to Big Hit. 

### We apologize for the delay in sending the books, and we thank you all *so so much* for your patience.

**Recap:** [Finished Books Video](https://youtu.be/HaUlx_uLsKM) | [Census Physical Copy Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaSuJ0YWGbjSjz562FOts_XhLoKvewpmIz3sYfK9nBrDf3ag/viewform?usp=sf_link) | Digital copy of census coming soon!

Focusing further I actually wanted to use the Agust D mixtape as a case study since he really successfully blends both Korean samples and Western samples (A Man's World!), as well as discusses taboo concepts in Korea like mental health, and then likens himself to a foreign character, Tony Montana. I really need help with sourcing as much info as possible to do this justice so if anyone has any links to academic sources or discussions that could aid with this I would be soooooooo grateful!!!! Also feel free to just add discussion points below, anything that discusses the ways hip-hop is being represented in new K Hip-hop formats would be great, and if this ties in with how it was explored within Agust D, that would be even better!

Personal Lives: Please respect BTS's privacy. No speculating on their personal/private lives (romantic shipping, dating, emotional/mental state etc.)."" Perfectly happy for mods to remove post if inapropriate or gets out of hand. This is about YOUR feelings. 

I, as probably many of you, have feelings attached to the members that are more than just ""celebrities we support"". Those feelings could be either strongly desiring &amp; fantasizing them as friends or more than friends. And as much as I would love to have a chance with my bias (or any of them, really), the reality is that I probably have a better chance of winning the lottery.

1. If you struggle with your feelings for BTS, how do you deal with that reality? Or maybe how are you not dealing with it (in denial)? If it were up to you, would you like them to be single forever?

For me knowing that, I personally would like to them to eventually find someone special to accompany them in life, have a family etc etc. Yes, I know not everyone desires a partner or children, and we can be perfectly content and happy in singlehood. But I am assuming here Bangtan is like most of the population who do have similar dreams like that. 
BTS is the only K-Pop group that I have gotten into, so I do not have much knowledge of other groups. But it seems to me that the more veteran idol groups like Shinhwa, Super Junior, Big Bang...out of the many members they have, only 1 or 2 members have settled down? So...

  2: Do you worry that BTS might never be able to find love/someone because of fame? Or perhaps you are not worried, for reasons such as e.g. they would have considered that outcome when choosing to become idols/just confidant they will find somebody/would rather them single etc 

I look forward to reading your replies ;)

EDIT: Oh and 3. Those of you who are married or have partners, do you struggle with feelings between BTS and your partner? Do your S.Os ever get jealous?",77,61

&amp;nbsp;

Excuse my typos in advance and be ready to smile the entire time reading this :)

&amp;nbsp;

**From Dot Jungkook to Jeon Seagull**

/17. Jungkook, debuted at an early age, was in charge of adolescence in the team. Except when he was on stage, he was extremely shy of strangers. When interviewed, he would hide himself behind his hyungs and stick only his head out. When standing on the red carpet, he would appear smaller because he stood a step behind. Also he gained a nickname Dot Jungkook because he firmly put period (.) in every post. In fact, Bang PD said Jungkook used to be even shier when he was a trainee. He struggled when he was singing in front of other people, so I used to be worried about how he would be an idol.

Hyungs poured their love to Jungkook who only quietly nodded his head to a question you dont have a friend, right? during a lie detector game. In fact, it is known that Jungkook doesnt know how to grill meat since the hyungs raised him by grilling and feeding him meat. During a Run, BTS episode, he clumsily put the grilling pan on his thigh, making the fans laugh. 

Hyungs dumped on Jungkook with mics for Jungkook who would not talk because of his shyness. They would make a space for him (who was standing behind) in the front row, look at him adorably to support him when he was talking, and secure an interview when he legally became an adult. Thanks to the six Jungkook moms who volunteered to help him, Jungkook has grown into someone who can reveal his Jeon Seagull (his nickname describing when he is excited) side even in front of cameras

&amp;nbsp;

**Madnae, Jungkook mom Jin**

Jin, whos ma:d-ee (the oldest sibling) according to age but has a personality of ma:knae (the youngest sibling), bickers with Jungkook. On Show Champion Behind, an entertainment program (MBC Music), Jungkook said to Jin Ive been raising you since I was 15, to which Jin responded Its me who raised you. I cant even count the number of meal that I bought you. He argued for a while, and it ended with something that cant be understood: what is 56 by 27? Fans happily enjoyed their conversation where the 5 years of age gap didnt show at all. 

Jin said the word he heard the most from Jungkook was Hyung, move your body like this, and added that he hates Jungkook the most when Jungkook teaches him dancing. But hes also the one who said I can only see Jungkook during Jungkooks graduation. In addition, in many group photos, we can see that Jungkook is sitting on Jins lap, which proves the love of Jin who volunteered to be Jungkooks sitting cushion. Jins sweet Jungkook mom side was also naturally revealed when he gave Jungkook his card while playing Hali Gali game, giving his back to Jungkook so that Jungkook can hide from the sunlight, giving a hot pack to Jungkooks frozen ears during an outdoor shooting.

Perhaps because of such relationship, Jungkook said whenever I write a melody, it suits Jin hyung the best, and the intro of Autumn Leaves, which Jungkook wrote the melody for, was sang by Jin.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Lamb skewer mate, Jungkook mom Suga**

Suga is Jungkooks lamb skewer mate who set fire on Jungkooks lamb skewer love. Jungkook revealed his Jeonayfly side, proving that he doesnt get intimidated at all by the chic hyung. Jeonafly is a combination of Jeon Jungkook and mayfly (a bug that lives only about a day and thus is not afraid of doing something wild/rude/dangerous because itll die soon anyway), and its Jungkooks nickname when he makes fun of his hyungs showing his beagle beauty. When he imitates Sugas crying after winning an award or Sugas voice who got removed from Fire due to his distinct voice could be an example of Jeonayfly. 

Suga, whos known for his lethargy, has the hardest time playing with Jungkook, but he cares the most about Jungkooks interview. In BTS 100 questions &amp; 100 answers, he said Its cute that Junkook is becoming an adult. When he was doing interviews for the first time, it seemed like he couldnt collect his thoughts, but now he answers firmly. It feels weird looking him like that. Recently, after hearing Jungkooks Daesang acceptance speech, he looked at Jungkook proudly saying You are now an adult. Im very happy. Why are you so good at talking? Suga is serving his role as Jungkook mom, seeing Jungkook from when Jungkook was shorter than him to when Jungkook outgrown him. 

Jungkook showed his gratitude to Suga. Jungkook created a birthday letter video by himself on Sugas birthday. He started with I dont have much to say but went on to express his love Youre so cool on stage and in studio. You are a hyung who has so much to learn from. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The worlds sweetest, Jungkook mom J-Hope**

To Jungkook saying I want to hug with friends like that, Jungkook mom J-Hope gave a sweet response Do you want to hug with friends? Will you hug with hyung? J-Hope is known to be the member who takes the jokes and pranks of the younger members the best. He said Jungkook really wants to improve himself at dancing and music. He also has a cute side. This tall guy would throw himself into my arms, and its physically challenging (to play with him). So I can sleep well at night.

J-Hope is a fool for his dongsaeng, Jungkook, who doesnt blame Jungkook for bugging him or hitting him by mistake while blowing a flute trumpet and who says This wasnt fair. You cant do this next time even when Jungkook jokingly eliminates J-Hope while playing a game. Although J-Hope is in charge of dancing, he would give Jungkook the spotlight by saying Jungkook does this well.

Jungkook also said Just being in one room with Hobi hyung makes me happy. Because of that, there are a lot of photos where Jungkook and J-Hope are sticking to each other. In J-Hopes mixtape music video shooting scene recently released, J-Hope naturally gave a hug to Jungkook. Fans said it was heartwarming.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Legend 31, Jungkook mom RM**

RM says like a habit Jungkook is so cute and hes so hansome. But the legend episode of Jungkook mom RM was the 31 game. During a fan sign, they were playing BaskinRobbins 31 and he could say 30, making Jungkook lose the game. But for Jungkook who wanted to win for sure, RM said 30, 31 and eliminated himself from the game. After a moment of silence, fans made aww sound, and Jungkook smiled saying this is our teams leader. In addition, RM would recommend songs that suit Jungkooks voice, just smile at it even it Jungkook put his clothes on the bed so that they block the sunlight, and take photos of sleeping Jungkook.

Jungkook also has a strong love for RM. In fact, RM was the reason that he decided to sign a contract with Big Hit even though he was casted by big agencies. He saw RM practicing while touring Big Hit, and he decided to stay because he thought RM was cool. Then he debuted as BTS.

In Baepsae, the directing guide of the part Jungkook rapped Saying that its my fault, youre joking, right? Saying that its fair, oh are you crazy was do it like RM. Fans were surprised to find out that the part that they believed to be RMs was in fact rapped by Jungkook. Jungkook also moved his seat at an awards ceremony following RM who was sitting away from the group because of the lack of space. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Overcoming Jungkooks adolescence, Jungkook mom Jimin**

Jungkook grew his love for dancing after his training in the US and thought hed give up the path as a singer and go under Son Sungdeuk director. Jimin is the one who persuaded Jungkook to change his mind and debut as BTS. Jimin himself had a lot of episodes before debuting, so fans say Jimin cared about Jungkook sincerely. 

Jimin is the one who first gained the nickname Jungkook mom. It was shown several times in Bangtan Bomb where Jimin said I dont want to film you to J-Hope, whos called Jimin mom, and followed Jungkook. In a photo thats well known for adolescent Jungkook, Jimin doesnt get embarrassed after repeated rejections by Jungkook and keeps joking around. Even in these days, Jimin keeps being Jungkook mom saying Jungkook, give me a kiss Jungkook, why do I like you this much, and Ill go on a date with Jungkook. 

Of course, there were occasions where Jimin said Im 2 years older than you! Ive had 2,130 more bowls of rice than you have!, but they are rare. Jungkook had a Run, BTS mission where he had to make Jimin say please dont do this. Jungkook pulled Jimins hair and sprayed water, but Jimin did not say dont do this until Jungkook himself got tired. Indeed, Jungkook once said Jimin hyung likes me more than my actual brother does.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Soul twin, Jungkook mom V**

If Jimin is a stereotypical Jungkook mom, V has raised Jungkook like a friend. Jungkook and V, who have their own way of greeting thats been updated several times, are called the soul twins. They indeed share the same hobbies. The scenery photo taken by V made an issue because it looked perfect like a desktop display photo. Jungkook is also releasing photos and videos under Golden Closet Film. Also fans have increased their expectation seeing Jungkook carrying around his camera with microphone. Also V said that Jungkook taught him Overwatch and they play the game together.

Thanks to the skits that only they themselves enjoy, they have once dominated their official Twitter account and YouTube channel. Jungkook would abruptly start lip-syncing and V would do guitar hand-syncing. Jungkook would suddenly pretend hes a hunter with rifle, and V would pretend to be a rabbit. Fans say that thanks to V who are always energetic and excited, Jungkook could reveal his Jeon Seagull side. Jungkook actually defined V as his life friend, saying I used to be so afraid of strangers that I hid myself to change clothes. But after hyung came, I changed. I became to act more freely.

Thanks to this friends-like relationship, even after Jungkook scolds V Why do we do a rehearsal, V would respond Im sorry, hehe, ending the conflict.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Begin, Jungkook**

Begin is the song that contains Jungkooks love for hyungs. Jungkook explained that Begin describes himself that grew up with hyungs and said hed like to thank RM who wrote the lyrics based on his story. 

Its already well-known among fans that all 7 of them cried after Jungkook said The only thing thats difficult for me is to see hyungs going through difficulties. On Star Show 360, an entertainment program (MBC Everyone), Jungkook said I started as a trainee when I was 15. Hyungs practically raised me. It was so hard to see hyungs, who I had gone through good and bad times together, mentally suffer. That might be why I shed tears. 

Maybe a week has 7 days so that we could love each member of BTS on each day.

Also, we're all kind of expecting a round of US promos from them after the BBMAs, so what kind of Western ""variety show"" would you like to seem them do?

**The heroes who made Hallyu myth into reality**

*Bang Si Hyuk and Bangtan Sonyeondans BIG HIT*

&amp;nbsp;

Seven youths of South Korea have made a big hit. They are showing tremendous influence as, in fact, a global power celebrity. Like Seo Taiji and Boys, who appeared like a comet in the 1990s, or even more so, they overturned the pop culture industry. The strategy of differentiation by Big Hit Entertainment, a small management agency led by CEO Bang Si Hyuk, literally made a big hit. 

&amp;nbsp;

When BTS got to LAX, it's like the Beatles were here, said Ellen DeGeneres when BTS were invited to her show on NBC in November, last year. She compared BTS to the Beatles invasion of America in 1964, which created the term Beatlemania. There appeared a term BTS mania, a 21st Century version of Beatlemania. In the same month, around 1,000 fans came to ABCs Jimmy Kimmel Show. Fans were screaming, cheering, fanchanting and singing along the entire time.

Last year, BTS wrote a historical record in the US. In the year-end chart released by Billboard, BTS took the 10th spot on the 2017 Top Artist, for the first time as a Korean act. In June, they were selected by Time as one of the 25 most influential people on the Internet. They performed at the AMAs, one of the three major American music awards ceremonies, showing their global status. These are the accomplishment that they made in about five years since their debut in June, 2013.

The power of their enthusiastic fans, called ARMY, played a big role. ARMY means army that protects BTS. Foreign fans of BTS are so active that CEO Bang Si Hyuk (T/N: Bang PD hereafter) mentioned that it felt like re-importation.
Joongang Sunday also specially featured BTS on January 7. This was because an idol group is causing a great change in the class who creates culture, consumption culture, and the content of Hallyu itself. The star was BTS, a group comprised of even members: Rap Monster (23), Suga (24), Jin (25), J-Hope (23), Jimin (22), V (22), and Jungkook (20).

For BTS to reach where they are now, the number one contributor is Band PD (46). Bang PD used to be already well-known as a hit-song composer, coming from JYP as a head composer, but it was his first attempt as a CEO to debut BTS. He made the concept Lets make a hero whose shoulder people can lean on. I contemplated over what the hero is that the contemporary youth wants. I wanted to make BTS as a friend who can be next to someone even without saying anything, not someone who preaches from above.

Bang PD used to be Billboard kid when young. He liked Duran Duran, a British pop band. During an interview, he said It was impressive and satisfying that the band who does music that I like are also handsome. Maybe I was fated to do idol producing, laughing.

People who work with Bang PD say his obsession about perfection is unrivaled. Bang PD himself doesnt really deny it. Im obsessed with creating contents very well, contents that can resonate within listeners. The thing we agonized over and carried out is also lets create every element as perfect as possible. When we prepare something, we have a mindset that anything can be sacrificed to reach that perfection. 
BTS success doesnt only comes from music. It also results from a breakaway from mysticism through the utilization of social media. K-pop is known as a full package including visual, music, son, dance, and social media, and BTS has a strength in social media. They are called the king of social media, and actually have a higher status online. Their official Twitter account was the most tweeted-about account globally, and they also set the Guinness record for most retweeted tweet. 

Each of the seven members occasionally turn on online broadcasting V Live app. Its a video where individual member posts and talks, getting much closer to fans. Under the videos, comments are continuously posted. When BTS upload a video where they talk about their daily life as they would do to their friends, viewers are provided with subtitles in 11 different languages such as French, Russian, Portuguese, Vietnamese, and Arabic. There are 2,000 likes/hearts per second. This is indeed a moment where the language barrier is destroyed.
After their performance at the AMAs last November, they took V app to say hello to and thank their fans, saying We were never this nervous since debut. But thanks to your cheering, we didnt get intimidated and were proud. The video, starting with 300 viewers, ended up with 2 million viewers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Leading the culture of identity empathy with contents they write and created by themselves**

BTS freely uploads content that they themselves unofficially made, in addition to official music videos and broadcast performance videos. This continues even during the period of inactivity. They post their own songs, covers, and songs with switched parts, and Bangtan Bombs where they share their daily life. RM (real name: Kim Namjoon), the leader of BTS, also told Joongang during his interview in 2016 Fans are precious people. We know their efforts and support for us, and it doesnt make sense if we didnt pay them back, emphasizing their communication on social media.

Their differentiated messaged contained in music also resonated. They are in line with Bang PDs philosophy that the lyrics must be the inner story of BTS themselves. Bang PD said that he doesnt forcefully manage their practice time or life. He gave freedom to members for most of the activities and let members participate on their own discretion. The training as a singer-songwriter included in the pre-debut preparation made BTS grow explosively.

Bang PD also looked back and said The identity of BTS also begun to be formed by the lyrics they themselves wrote.
The fact that their earlier songs mostly talked about school was because most of them were students. There were criticisms that the students rebellious story is an outdated concept, but Bang PD believed that its important to tell ones own story. And it worked. Fans started to grow, and overseas fans also said that they relate to BTS stories a lot. 

*Why are you talking about spoon, Im a human / So what / Just live your own way, its yours anyways / Just stop trying, its okay to lose.* (Fire)

*Sampo Generation Opo Generation / I like beef jerky so YookPo Generation / The media and the adults say we dont have a will / Selling us out and talking bad of us / Why do they kill us before we even try* (Dope)

*The thought hits me that if I get successful with music in Daegu, at best Ill end up owning some music school /  / I used to practice at night and do part-time job at dawn / then drag my tired body to school and fall asleep / and now I became 20 years old My graduation ceremony scene is quite shitty* (724148)

The lyrics of BTS carried the words that are commonly used in Korean society such as dirt spoon and sampo generation, inducing the empathy of the youth. The members, coming from various regions (Ilsan, Gwacheon, Daegu, Gwangju, Busan, Geochang, and Busan), expressed their own stories. They based their lyrics on reality, containing the raw worries of reality as they are. Band PD said the fan culture arises from universal contemporaneity that is valid globally.

Their music videos have also sublimated into a genre of art that give a lot of room for interpretation. In a nutshell, they have created another culture among the fans for them to infer and learn the meaning. An example is how their second regular album, Wings, was inspired by Demian of Hermann Hesse.  
Experts analyze that they have a classical aspect that embraces world classical literature and movies. Last May, Jin posted a photo on Twitter of himself holding flowers with a caption Smeraldo. Fans, through various steps of inference, revealed that it meant BTS comeback. Rolling Stones commented that BTS build mythologies with albums.

It was also worthy to make themselves viewed as artists by doing various activities outside of music writing. They shared scenery and still photos, introduced other musicians music, and did a Mukbang show EAT Jin, utilizing each members personality. They even collaborated with Naver Line Friends to create characters, creating a new consumer content.

&amp;nbsp;

**Positive influence in the connected world**

However, there was also a crisis. In the beginning of 2016, there was a controversy of misogynous lyrics spread around Korean fancafe. Woman is the best gift and Yes, youre the best woman, overusing your power were criticized for encouraging misogyny. Big Hit Entertainment immediately acknowledged, and BTS immediately accepted the criticism and changed the lyrics when performing. This was not the end. Before their 2017 comeback, they visited a professor of womens studies and asked for proofreading of the lyrics. BTS took the controversy as an opportunity to improve themselves and regained their popularity. 

Bang PD emphasizes the global trend of hyper-connected society. This means that music has a strength as one of the contents that travel over language barriers. The perfectly synchronized performance of BTS can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their nationality and language. It is universal. Thus, K-pop is a very visual music that is suitable for flexible communication.

Even now, Bang PD believes that idol should not be a false idol, but a content of positive influence. Their social change campaign LOVE MYSELF is a representative example. BTS and Big Hit made an initial donation of 500 million KRW, and fledged to donate 3% of album sales profits. The fund will be go towards #ENDviolence campaign by UNICEF. Each of their content with global impact has a clear intention of giving positive influence.

He also emphasizes positive influence in his speech. I wanted idols to be artists that can closely communicate with their fans person to person, exchanging positive influence, and have a horizontal, not vertical, leadership. Fans these days actively and independently act and express, creating a new form of fans.
Bang PD pledges to continue his role as an assistant to the members. I believe my role going forward is to keep help them continue their growth story. Like many senior artists and teams paved a way for BTS, I hope BTS can play a role in opening up a new path.

&amp;nbsp;

**BTS Spoken by Experts**

""The members of BTS did not dance well like they all do now. In the performance of BTS, dance is a very critical element. Their choreography is so intense and difficult that they would become exhausted after only a couple of rounds. Other singers do hard, of course, but the members of BTS have overcame their ability with a tremendous amount of practice."" - Son Sungdeuk / BTS performance director - 

""It is hard for foreign fans to understand the meaning of the songs no matter how much English is mixed. For them to most easily understand K-pop is to listen to the songs through dance and to reproduce the music as dance."" -Kim Jungwon / Ph.D. Candidate in Ethnomusicology, UC Riverside-

""Pdogg and Bang PD are not satisfied with anything that is not the best. They work extremely hard until they get the outcome. Other people would say 'that's enough', but they work hard with the mindset 'we have to do it again until it's right', 'until it's perfect'."" -Erik Reichers / The Echo Bar Recording Studios-

""When a new album is released, what people get exposed to first is the music video. Along with the music, it contains the direction that the singer is taking, the concept of the album, and the message that the singer wants to deliver."" -Lumpens / Visual artist, art director-

""Bangtan is formed within the idol system, but they are autonomous. They learn by themselves not by external forces, so they are 'self-study type' idol, so to say."" -Hong Seok Kyeong / Professor of Communication, SNU-

""Psy became famous by being mentioned by famous figures, so it was a sort of top-down mechanism. On the other hand, it's bottom-up for BTS; the fans continuously create content of BTS. There is usually a difference between how Korean fans and foreign fans act, but the difference is getting narrowed for the fans of BTS."" -Kim Suk-Young / Professor of Theater, Film, and Television, UCLA-

""Exposure is the most important and the most basic thing that expand and strengthen the support. When you get exposed to someone, you develop a sense of closeness, and when you feel close to that someone, it is likely that you will keep liking that person."" -Lee Jae Kook / Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, SKKU- 

""BTS is engraved to people's mind as 'friends that are connected with me via social media', not idol stars inside television. Their success is perceived as the growth and success of one's friend, oppa, hyung, dongsaeng, or nephew, making one cry and laugh with BTS."" -Kim Sungchul / Writer of ""This is Bangtan DNA""-

997,2018-3-29,2018,3,29,2,87u17g,180328 Subreddit Updates,llaverna,1522259906,"Hi, /r/bangtan! [](#v_cute)

This announcement is to inform you of some updates we have made on the subreddit.

Firstly, we have changed the wording of a few of the rules for clarity and consistency (e.g. the ""B 9. Simple Questions"" rule). Their function and enforcement has stayed the same, they should just be easier to read and understand now. Low-effort edits, wallpapers and quick doodles have been added in the ""B 8. Low-effort content"" section.

Onwards to more specific issues:

#Articles

BTS have gotten big, y'all. Awesome! However, this means that every single time they are featured as a sidenote in any random article is not noteworthy anymore. We have modified the clickbait rule to reflect this:

&gt;**Content-void articles:** Blatant clickbait articles are not allowed. If an article lacks substance (e.g. brief mentions, playlists, news that has already been posted about etc.) and **is not from a noteworthy outlet**, it should be shared in the weekly /r/bangtan Room instead.

So if an article is not exactly clickbait, but is still void of meaningful content, and the outlet reporting about BTS is itself not a remarkable piece of news, please head to the weekly thread.

#Fanart

Fanart has perhaps the strongest [love-hate division](https://i.imgur.com/gLUwwv9.gif) in the /r/bangtan community: we receive an increased amount of complaints whenever fanart submissions are spiking. Our experiments with a weekly fanart thread in the past have proven to be unsuccessful, and banning that type of content altogether is not something we are willing to do.

We wish to compromise and still allow fanworks on the subreddit, but we must **ask the fanartists to respect the subreddit as well**. If you receive a request from us to not post that many submissions within a short time period, or instructions to use a relevant megathread instead, the above reason is why. We are not interested in depriving you of your exposure - these are just our tools to keep the amount of fanart at a manageable level on the subreddit, and we ask for your understanding when we use them.

For users frustrated with fanart or any other one type of content flooding the subreddit, we'd like to remind you that it is possible to **hide submissions by the flair** using [the Reddit Enhancement Suite extension](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) (in the settings console -&gt; Subreddits -&gt; filteReddit -&gt; Flair).

On a somewhat related note...

#BT21 Flair

BT21 has its own flair now!

#Bots

We have banned disruptive bots as we see them, but there are a few that provide potentially useful functions. They still get reported as spammy, so we'd like to ask your opinion on the usefulness of the following bots:

* /u/tweettranscriberbot and /u/TweetMirrorBot - transcribe tweets and link to mirrored images for when Twitter is unaccessible
* /u/FatFingerHelperBot - reposts links with longer text for ease of tapping on mobile
* /u/_youtubot_ and /u/Mentioned_Videos - create tables of linked YouTube videos with some essential information listed

Let us know if these are bots you use regularly. Feel free to also report other bots that are spammy or disruptive, and we can get rid of them.

#Drama

There has been an uptick in some non-constructive drama on the subreddit. We're all restless before the comeback, but **drama is still against the rules**. Linking to dramatic posts elsewhere, bringing some hate or gossip in the comments, inflammatory rants and other behavior that does not help generate mature discussion is still prohibited. [Please don't do it.](https://i.imgur.com/ou4paLB.gif) Please **do report it when you see it happen**, so moderators can get to it quickly.

#Other business

**Compilations**: Please remember to compile tweetstorms and other similar content in a single self post for ease of navigating and to avoid cluttering the subreddit. If you have already posted a link and can't edit a text post, compiling the rest of the links in a reply of the existing submission is also an option, [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/81rqmp/180304_dispatch_korea_instagram_dicon_jhope/dv4n239/). Compiling similar type of content (or content with close logical relation, e.g. the members bickering at each other on Twitter) into one post is almost always a better option!

**Using header formatting in comments**: This means bigass letters like the ""Other business"" title right up there. Please don't use them in comments as a boosted up caps lock, it is awfully massive on some mobile apps and you might get reported for being spammy/obnoxious.

**Post flairs**: Please remember to use them! You can see all the flairs and their functions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/flairs). Writing a flair manually (like so: [DISCUSSION]) does nothing but make the title messier, so use our existing flair system instead!

And once more:

#Report suspicious stuff.

Reports are anonymous and cost nothing. Even if you're not sure if a post or a comment breaks the rules, you can still report it so we can take a look. The subreddit is getting big, yet the mod team has stayed the same size (which is a problem we will remedy Soon), and we can't always see everything as soon as it happens. Reports help us a lot, and we have much [love and appreciation](https://i.imgur.com/O0n0s0n.gif) for everyone who takes the time to do it.

That's it! Thank you for your help in keeping /r/bangtan awesome. If you have any questions/comments, let us know.",41,180
