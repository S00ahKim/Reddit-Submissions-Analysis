Hello Reveluvs! Welcome to the first round of the ***Ice Cream Cake*** Survivor series and Discussion!
For those of you who are new to Survivor  each day, well be voting off a song to be eliminated from the game until were left with just one song, which will be considered the winner!

After the success of the [previous survivor for Summer Magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/red_velvet/comments/977jhz/red_velvet_survivor_summer_magic_round_one/) I thought it was about time that we kicked off survivor's for older albums/mini's. So without further ado lets kick off the survivor for the debut Mini, Ice Cream Cake!

**RULES:**

* Threads will be posted between 12-5pm GMT (Generally)

* Voting will last approximately 48 hours per poll (I'll be posting them every other day due to my schedule).

* You are voting for a track to be ***eliminated***. Do not vote for your favorite.

* In the event of a tie, **both** songs will be eliminated.

* Lobbying for a track is encouraged, downvoting or trolling because someone disagrees is not.

* You can ONLY vote through the Google Form  votes via the comments will not count!

Hello Reveluvs! Welcome to the third round of the ***Ice Cream Cake*** Survivor series and Discussion!
For those of you who are new to Survivor  each day, well be voting off a song to be eliminated from the game until were left with just one song, which will be considered the winner!

The song unfortunately eliminated in [Round Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/red_velvet/comments/9exz8c/red_velvet_survivor_ice_cream_cake_round_two/) was **Take It Slow** with 51.3% of the votes. Again this song was overwhelmingly chosen to be eliminated, showing that most voters have similar opinions of the album thus far.

**RULES:**

* Threads will be posted between 12-5pm GMT (Generally)

* Voting will last approximately 48 hours per poll (I'll be posting them every other day due to my schedule).

* You are voting for a track to be ***eliminated***. Do not vote for your favorite.

* In the event of a tie, **both** songs will be eliminated.

* Lobbying for a track is encouraged, downvoting or trolling because someone disagrees is not.

* You can ONLY vote through the Google Form  votes via the comments will not count!

Hello Reveluvs! Welcome to the fourth round of the ***Ice Cream Cake*** Survivor series and Discussion!
For those of you who are new to Survivor  each day, well be voting off a song to be eliminated from the game until were left with just one song, which will be considered the winner!

Apologies for the delay in releasing this round, over the weekend it was my birthday and I've been very busy, the regular release schedule should be followed from now!

The song unfortunately eliminated in [Round Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/red_velvet/comments/9fhsfj/red_velvet_survivor_ice_cream_cake_round_three/) was **Candy** with 49.1% of the votes. This song was chosen by just under half of the voters, this seems to be the theme of the album - probably because it's an old mini which peoples opinions have settled for.

**RULES:**

* Threads will be posted between 12-5pm GMT (Generally)

* Voting will last approximately 48 hours per poll (I'll be posting them every other day due to my schedule).

* You are voting for a track to be ***eliminated***. Do not vote for your favorite.

* In the event of a tie, **both** songs will be eliminated.

* Lobbying for a track is encouraged, downvoting or trolling because someone disagrees is not.

* You can ONLY vote through the Google Form  votes via the comments will not count!
