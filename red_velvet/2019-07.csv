**Warning/Disclaimer: The difference in votes for lots of the categories is pretty extreme, and there is low representation for some members. If you're easily upset with this kind of stuff, there is no harm to me or the sub if you'd like to move on. Please be aware when reviewing these results that this is just a sample size of less than 150 people from Reddit and is not the true telling of all opinions. Be respectful in the comments and do not attack people because they voted differently. This same survey on this same subreddit 2 months from now could be have very different results. Similarly, do not use this as a way to brag about your bias ""clearly being the best"".**

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BXk4pVFDy73VXAGXxWCxZRxasGPT9pujsPEO1NBZZOE/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BXk4pVFDy73VXAGXxWCxZRxasGPT9pujsPEO1NBZZOE/viewanalytics) 

&amp;#x200B;

The link above will send a pie chart of all of the data and votes for each category. If you want to see the full excel sheet of each individual survey, let me know and I can get you a link for that.

Something I found a bit interesting; Wendy had the most bias votes (31%), but only won 3 categories. My takeaway from this is that people didn't vote on who their favorite in the group was, but more-so took an actual look at the category and each member that fit it. So, with different categories, things may have gone differently. Similarly, this same survey done in 2 months with the same 145 people would yield different results. This was done for fun, please don't take it too seriously.",3,19

But things came up last minute and some friends invited me out so I didn't get an episode prepared. Im also finalizing my move into my new place today so I wouldn't have much time to edit.

So as the title says, does anyone here have or maybe are thinking about getting a Red Velvet tattoo? I gotta say, this has been on my mind since Redmare. I've been giving a lot of thought into getting a RV tattoo more and more each day. I've been trying to look ahead a year and ask myself if it's something I will regret. I honestly can't see myself ever regretting this. As cheesy as it might sound the amount of impact RV has had on my life and especially after the concert has been insane. I remember reading the post Redmare thread and seeing a lot of people comment on how much RV has influenced them to chase their dreams and improve their daily lives (myself included). Since the show way back in February, I'm eating much healthier, going to the gym regularly and as someone who usually gives up super easily, I've still been chasing what I want to do in life. I've always wanted a tattoo as well and it just seems like the perfect opportunity to get something RV related. I know a lot of K-pop related tattoos usually don't sit well with other people but if it has a special meaning to you, who cares if other people don't like it. I didn't mean to ramble on this much but I'm genuinely curious to see if anyone else has given the thought into getting a RV tattoo or already has one.",18,18

Hey all, sorry for the delayed upload. I genuinely went all day yesterday thinking I needed to do something and couldn't remember what it was until I went to bed and remembered that I hadn't edited yet. So I got up today and did it as quick and efficiently as I could so I could upload it today instead of waiting. So here you go! Sorry again and I can't wait to see you all for next weeks episode! :)",2,29

So what do I mean when I say live vocal performances? Videos of their live singing includes radio shows, tv/music shows, vlives, concerts, recordings, etc where they sing the entire song live with little to no choreography.. Some choreo is fine as long as it doesn't take their focus away from singing too much. I even included some music show win encores where I think they sang adequately instead of messing around which idols tend to do instead in encores. So without further ado, this is what i've got so far. Please do help me fill in the blanks if possible

https://i.redd.it/jt00m9zwvxb31.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""

**Q. ""Hi, Seulgi."" I've always wanted to greet you like this but I couldn't.**

**Seulgi**: If you did, I would've applauded you and said, ""Oh, you know what it means."" You immediately knew what I was talking about. 

**Q. Of course. So how did it happen? You were able to open your own instagram page.**

**Seulgi**: Up until now, Red Velvet' s official page was the only one available. Being able to communicate as a whole is good but I thought being able to make my own space and using that to communicate would be great as well. However I was worried because I don't use social media that often and it worried me because I don't know how to use it to make it look good. 

**Q. I noticed that you do uploaded at least twice a day so I think you're doing fine?**

**Seulgi**: I've been uploading pictures to inform fans of what I'm doing, what kind of styling (hair and makeup) I'm getting and what I am doing to prepare myself for a performance.

**Q. Making your own social media site doesn't seem like a big deal but it is. You've created a space for not Red Velvet but Kang Seulgi to have her own solo activities.** 

That's why I can't leave behind comments that much. It's embarrassing. For example, when I was using Red Velvet's official one, we would leave behind comments like, ""Thank you"" after winning first place. You knew exactly what the message meant. But I feel cautious on my own social media. Even after uploading something, I have so many thoughts in my head. I can't say that it's entirely my own space.

**Q. Even I feel like that when I only have 3 digits in my follower count but for you, you have 7 digits in your follower count.** 

But I think I'm leaving behind a lot of memories after starting instagram. For example, I leave behind memories of myself when I look really dressed up but I'm also leaving behind results of my hair stylist, makeup artist and stylist. It feels like a photo album. 

**Q. But still, isn't it a bit too much to be only following 4 accounts? You follow Joy, Yeri, Red Velvet's official account and SM Town's official account.** 

It's because I'm still a beginner (laughs).

**Q. If there was someone you want to follow next who is it? Exclude Beyonce.**

Exclude Beyonce?

**Q. I thought you would've chosen her first because I read many interviews about how you said you were a Beyonce fan. Then Billie Eilish.**

Billie Eilish? She's very popular at the moment. (She showed us the MV on her phone). She also really young. I think she's in high school but she makes her own music. When I first saw her music video, I was very surprised and thought ""Who is this person?"" 

**So she has her own color.**

 She does and even her voice color is really nice so it's really fun to watch her perform. She has that feeling like it would nice for her to follow me if I followed her.

 **Even for a 6th year Kpop Idol, following each other is still a fluttering thought.**

 It'd be really nice. 

**I heard it'll be Red Velvet's 5th year anniversary on August 1st.**

 Already...? After becoming a singer, it seems as though time moves a lot faster. You release 3 albums then perform at the end of the year ceremonies and then you realize a year has already passed. This year on New Years, all the members gathered at MBC's we talked about how a year has already passed. We were surprised by it. I even wonder how time has passed by so quickly. 

**5 years have passed for Red Velvet but also you \[Seulgi\] was 21 and now you're 26.** 

On New Years, the members and I were talking and said, ""How old are you now? I'm 26. Wait, I'm already 26?"" and we were surprised by it. I'm always surprised but it. The only time I can tell is when my physically tired but other than that I can't really tell. 

**Already...?**

 Really. There are times when I hear popping noises from my knees. (laughs). Recently, the members have been really interested in healthy foods. We take the vitamins our fans give us. For me, my aunt said I need to take care of my body so she had Korean herbal medicine made for me. I've been drinking energy drinks before I go up to perform so I can get strength.

 **You talk like this but I was really surprised by you. I purposely chose the first performance of to watch. You were exactly the same. There was no change from before. I thought you were very stable when you sang and danced. You can edit a music video but you can't do that for a live performance. Is this the results of practice or because you're used to it?** 

I also watch past performances and think 'I really look like a baby. I look so young and fresh."" (laughs). But if there is something I've gotten better at is being more mature and experienced... Before just entering the broadcasting station made me nervous. Just the idea of being there made me feel awkward but now it's comfortable like a home. Of course, it is nerve wracking showing off new material but it's a good nervous feeling. In the past, I was really scared but now I think, 'I need to show this off. Today's the day that I show it off'.

**So you've matured. In past interviews, the members have also mentioned that you \[Seulgi\] was very calm. People can say that your 'mentality is strong because of your calm tendencies. I also think it's because you try to change your nervous energy to try to feel more stable. Being stable can make you look calm.**

 I think so too. When I was younger I used to think, 'I'm really mentally strong' but I really don't think that's what it was. Of course, there are times when I'm swamped with emotions and it gets hard. However, I overcome it because I want to beat it. 

**Were you born with this personality?** 

It's one of my personalities but I also work at it really hard. I know. I know if I fall into it, my mentality can break down. Things that can become good can easily turn into bad so I try to immediately stop it. I learned to stop it. 

**From who?** 

From myself. I've experienced it all. There was a time when my emotions hit rock bottom and I couldn't stop bawling. But the results never turn out good. I realized that if you don't try to purposely bring out your emotions, and instead try to talk more positively then you'll be able to come out of it. 

**When was it when your emotions hit rock bottom?**

 The first time was when I was a trainee. After I went through that I realized I could overcome anything. But after that time... recently? (laughs) 

**Recently? Why?**

 I think those emotions just come once in a while. This happened when I was a trainee. I would suddenly think, Am I doing well?'. These thoughts would pop into my head once or twice and even after I debuted. Sometimes I wonder, 'Am I really doing well? What do I need to work?'

 **What do you do in those times?** 

I think it's good to learn something. 

**So you mean to be able to focus on something.** 

There are times when I feel my passion has burned down. There are times when I do something fun and then suddenly I don't feel anything about it. To be able to bring back that passion, you need to be relaxed but also I think it's important to learn something. I think what is something good to learn. So I want to learn this and also wanna learn that. 

**I read your past interviews and thought I shouldn't ask about your trainee life in this interview. I thought what's the point of talking about something you've endured for 7 years but I possibly can't not talk about it. To learn about Seulgi now, we need to talk about it. Yes, that's right.Talking about mentality and being able to overcome it, you learned all this during that time.**

 That's correct. I think for a person to overcome something, they need to go through it. That's why you can't always be in a comfortable state. Because it's gonna be hard to overcome when something occurs. 

**You don't sound like someone who's 26... Are you sure you're not 36?**

 I haven't really overcome anything big. (laughs) 

**I don't think that matters. The important part is to be able to know what you've learned from that experience.** 

Yes. I think that I've become a bit more steady.

 **So what do you wanna learn nowadays?** 

I haven't thought of anything yet but I am thinking about researching. Recently, I bought a used film camera. I don't know if it's because I suck, films weird, or because the camera is old but the quality is not that great. I'm thinking if I need to buy another camera or if I need to change the film. (takes out her phone to show the photos from the film camera). I tried it out on my members. I know I didn't do a good job at it....

 **It's pretty!**

 Is the quality supposed to be like this?

 **It's because it's a film camera photo. Isn't this good quality despite being a film camera?**

 (shows off another photo) This photo is from a different film camera. 

**I understand what you mean. There's a difference in the exposure index.** 

Right? It's different right? I need to try it out and do more research on it. I enjoy taking photos of scenery. That's why I wanna take photos of different countries scenery. 

**Where do you wanna go?** 

Cuba. Yesterday, I was eating subjebi with Juhyun unnie and we were watching a rerun of JTBC's Traveler. It was so beautiful. I heard they even dance when they hear the sound of a coin. I really wanna go visit.
