""Although theres a big burden that I have to be as good as my unnies (t/n: what a younger girl calls an older girl, formal language), Im just happy that I can be on stage.""
There are rookie girl groups spilling out everyday. Most of these groups went with a sexy concept, but the four member girl group, Red Velvet, that debuted last month was different. There wasnt a member that was wearing a low cut shirt nor a too short skirt. Seulgi, Irene, Wendy, Joy managed to catch the eyes of people at once with their different hair colors as well as peoples ears with a song that didnt have to do with love nor separation but rather Happiness.


** Debuting after a long training period**

SM Entertainment, commonly called the Idol Academy, released their first girl group in five years, Red Velvet, who debuted with their debut single Happiness on the August 1st broadcast of KBS2 Music Bank.
SM, starting off with their first generation idols H.O.T and S.E.S, is known for having many idol stars that were only able to debut after a long and harsh training period. Seulgi, who debuted after 7 years of training, stated, I was happy to debut.
Although she was very happy, she was also worried about having to do as well as S.E.S, Girls Generation, and f(x) while being in the midst of so many rookie girl groups.
""Because Ive been waiting so long to stand on stage, everything after I debuted is happiness. Although there are some unpredictable occurrences, I think schedules are fun. To be honest, I thought I would be nervous on my debut stage, but many fans came to cheer us on so I was able to enjoy it."" (Irene)
""A month managed to pass by when I spent day by day concentrating on singing and dancing and like that two years passed, and I was debuting. The happiest thing is that the four of us were able to do it together. Even during our training period, the four of us worked well together."" (Wendy)

** Happy Days**

Red Velvets oldest is Irene at 24 while the youngest is Joy at 19. In between are same aged friends, Wendy and Seulgi at 21. They shared that they were like sisters back during their trainee times as well.
""Seulgi unnie is very strong internally. When Im upset it can show up on my face, but Seulgi unnie is never like that. During practice she would always do her best so I thought she was a really cool sunbae. Shes skilled in singing and dancing, and theres so much I can learn from her. However, I liked her even more because she would treat me like I was her younger sister."" (Joy)
As Joy complimented Seulgi, oldest Irene jumped aboard the compliment relay.
""Joy is the youngest in Red Velvet, but shes the dependable oldest child in her family. She has two younger sisters. I think thats why she thinks in a very mature manner. Sometimes she feels like a friend and sometimes a younger sister, but when she listens to my concerns, she seems like an older sister."" (Irene)
Blue haired Wendy let off a laugh as refreshing as her hair color. The idea for having different hair dyes was decided through the company after several meetings. Thanks to it, however, I think people could memorize our names faster.

** Drawing their colorful future**

Their debut song Happiness was a Europop song with a strong synthesizer sound as well as a beat that gives off an African feel, and it shared a positive message about feeling happiness through the small things in life and learning to love yourself. In this industry, it says that a singer follows the title of its songs. Does Red Velvet live while feeling happiness in the smallest things in life?
""We just debuted, but I was surprised at the fact that we have fans. When I first went to a music broadcast recording, I didnt think they were our fans. I was really happy when they filled up all the seats."" (Irene)
""These days, Im into learning guitar. About the time Red Velvets third full album comes out, I hope to include a self composed song."" (Seulgi)
""I want to show various images of me. If I get the chance, I want to participate in a food program. Im really confident in an mukbang (t/n: eating broadcast.)."" (Wendy)
""After debuting, its at a point where I dont know how time goes by anymore. Im busy from school to schedules, but Im happy."" (Joy)

123,2014-9-25,2014,9,25,13,2hegb3,140923 Red Velvet Articles,thenerdal,1411618743,"###**RED VELVETS DEBUT DIARY**

Although they all had different colored hair, the twinkle in their eyes were all shining the same. Red Velvet, the four girls who are sweet as cake showed up in the entertainment industry. SM Entertainments first rookie girl group in five years had everyones expectations on them from the star.
Was it because it was their first for everything? The newly debuted girls were so drenched in happiness that it was impossible to find all the burden that was on their weak shoulders. However, they did not look immature. While they would smile shyly because they were awkward with interviews, they talked their hearts out when talking about their dreams.
Seulgi, who trained the longest out of the members, was happy after every moment since their debut.
""Even schedules are fun. For me, working is a new experience. Its cool and fun."" (Seulgi)
The youngest, 19 year old Joy, was happy fulfilling her dream of a singer as well. 24 year old leader and oldest, Irene, gets power from her fans.
""Im happy that I can stand on the stage that Ive been dreaming for a long time."" (Joy)
""I can feel that people like us so it gives me more energy."" (Irene)
If they were regular students, they would be enjoying their college lives or getting ready for their entrance exams, but from a young age, these girls decided to walk the road of a singer.
Wendy, who went to school in Canada, received influence from her music loving parents. Joy went on stage for the first time at a field trip and managed to find her dream.
""I started playing instruments as a hobby. I liked R&amp;B and soul music because I lived in Canada. My parents also loved music. My parents listened to a lot of emotional music such as Park Hyoshin sunbae-bim or Kim Bumsoo sunbae-nim, and I received a lot of influence from them. I want to return what Ive received to many others. I wish people could get comforted when they are sad or feel happier through my music."" (Wendy)
""I went on stage and sang for the first time on a second year of junior high (t/n: eighth grade) field trip. Even my friends who didnt like me cheered me on, and I felt electricity flowing through me. I liked standing on stage and continued on small stages until my friends suggested I auditioned which is why I went to audition at SM Entertainment in my first year of high school (t/n: sophomore year of high school), and I managed to pass."" (Joy)

There were harder times after miraculously passing the audition. 7 year trainee Seulgi, and 2 year trainee Joy were no exceptions.
""During my 4-5th year of training, I got into a slump. I felt like I was at a standstill where I wouldnt improve anymore so I grew tired. However, when I look back at it, I think that slump made me get to where I am today. If I didnt go through that, I feel like I would have been mentally week."" (Seulg)
""It was difficult when my singing and dancing would not get better. I had a hard time as I doubted whether I could do this, but it all paid off."" (Joy)
Practicing became a lot more enjoyable when their debut team was official, and the four of them were together.
""The most fun was when the four of us put on a performance or went around on trips. Theres a lot of fun memories after becoming a team."" (Seulgi)
""I have a lot of memories of the four of us. I remember that once because we had to diet, we would turn on exciting music and just run around in heavy raincoats. It was fun then, and now I look back to it, I realize I was really happy."" (Joy)
While they were recording their debut song, Happiness, the girls goofiness was unstoppable.
""If you listen to the song, there are parts where we say, Happiness, I want it, Lets Dream. We all went into the recording studio together and in order to give off the feel it should, we all screamed at the top of our lungs. Everybody was surprised because they probably thought we would be very girl."" (Wendy)
""That was the first time the four of us recorded together."" (Seulgi)

Minus Seulgi, everybody in Red Velvet uses a stage name. When asked if there was a special reason they were given such foreign names, they gave very straightforward and simple answers.
""I just use the name I used back in Canada."" (Wendy)
""Joy means joy in English. The trainer unnie that basically raised us thought it would be a good idea to give a positive name, she gave the name to me. Lee Sooman teacher thought it was a good name as well."" (Joy)
Irene seemed embarrassed to share her reason with her own mouth as she laughed silently and started talking quieter and quieter.
""The trainer unnie gave me my name as well, and it means. Goddess of Peace."" (Irene)
Right away, evidence was thrown out about how the leader Irene was in charge of peace within the group. Although she appears small and weak, to her dongsaengs (t/n: younger siblings, people; formal language), she exists as the trustworthy pillar. 
""Irene unnie is in charge of peace within the group. I go to her for a lot of advice. She gives us roles in the dorm to make sure we dont get into arguments."" (Seulgi)
""She helps the members communicate with each other. The kind of person who supports you silently from the back."" (Wendy.)

Irene, who was always watching from one step behind, had a lot to say when it came to her members. Seulgi, whom shes watched for five years, is a dongsaeng that she always wants to take care of.
""The Seulgi I saw for five years never changed. However, I can see the little changes inside her. Although it may look like Seulgi is doing everything well on her own, I can see it. As an unnie I want to hear her stories, I want to tell her stories, and I just want to take care of her. She can be a little clumsy."" (Irene)
The always bright and refreshing Wendy is sensitive, and Joy may be young, but shes a thoughtful dongsaeng.
""Although she takes care of others well, it worries me. When others see Wendy, they only see the bright sides of her, but as a person who sees her everyday and talks to her, I see the parts of her that are broken and hurt. Wendy can have a weak heart at times."" (Irene)
""Joy is the youngest within Red Velvet, but shes the oldest child at home. She thinks about her two younger sisters a lot, and shes not simply just young; she has a mature side to her. It must have been hard to go from the oldest to the youngest, but she does well as the youngest in our group as shes cute. She sometimes does aegyo (t/n: acting cute) as well."" (Irene)
What is the dorm life for these four tight girls? Pink, green, blue, orange. Due to their different hair colors, there was a lot of happenings at the dorm.
""When cleaning up after a shower, you can tell whose hair is whos on the ground. For now because of our schedules, we have a rule of cleaning up our own hair as well as individual responsibilities. Cleaning your own dishes and cleaning up after yourself after eating."" (Seulgi)
Itd be a lie if these girls said they didnt feel pressured about being a SM idol group.
""I cant say I dont feel a burden. Being the first girl group from SM in five years, we have to show a good image, and fans are expecting a lot So we prepared more and thought a lot about how to show various images of ourselves, so Im confident."" (Seulgi)

However, they have the luck of meeting their sunbaes who have reached the top. Especially Super Junior who is Red Velvets successful mentor.
Whenever the girls talked about Super Juniors Mamacita performances that oozed 10 year experience, the girls could not hide their admiration.
 We were there at the pre-recording for Mamacita, and they would talk to their fans like they were close friends and acted as if they were their blood related oppas. However, as soon as the stage started, they showed a professional image. (Joy)
""I could sense that they were working hard. Although they arent rookies anymore, they still work hard like rookies, and it made me think that I should never lose my roots and act like them. I was also nervous because they were good at finding the cameras."" (Wendy)
""I thought I was at a concert. It was cool how they were so relaxed on stage."" (Seulgi)
As a group who just stepped into the entertainment industry, there were dreams they wanted to fulfill as a lot of wishes.
""I think we should show off more variety. I hope you guys expect a lot."" (Seulg)
""I want to try out different things. Instead of staying consistent, I plan on showing this image, and that image.""
""I want to deliver Red Velvets Happiness to our fans. There are many people who dont know us because we are rookies, but I want to get ourselves known where people can tell us apart even with the same hair color. I heard that people thought we looked the same in pictures, and I wonder how it would have been if we didnt all dye our hair. ""(Wendy)

What is happiness to the four girls who scream about happiness. Red Velvet was more serious than ever when asked the last question.
""Having people next to you where you can share good things. Thats happiness."" (Joy)
""Im the same as Joy. I like feeling the same things with good people around me. I listen to music depending on the weather and whenever I do that I record why I listened to this song and how I felt while listening to it. I want to share this information with people later. If someone comes up to me and tell me that they feel a certain way, the fact that I could answer to them I listened to this when I felt that way, I like that."" (Irene)
""Working is happiness. Having trained for so long, I practiced in one location from one set time to another so going around to places in the car seems like a vacation itself."" (Seulgi)
""I think Im happy that I can do what I want. Just like Joy and Irene unnie, sharing happiness is a good thing, but one has to be happy themselves in order to share it. Wouldnt it be happiness if I showed off myself being happy doing what I love?"" (Wendy)
