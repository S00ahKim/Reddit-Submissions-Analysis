I got permission from our sub mods to post, so hopefully this is alright with you guys that I share this with you! 


I designed three items for the tour:

[A 18cm PVC Handfan](https://i.imgur.com/AUycOAs.jpg)

[A Lenticular Hard Plastic Group Postcard](https://i.imgur.com/7vONEPD.jpg)

[Individual Member Acrylic Keychains with a Group Photo on the Back](https://i.imgur.com/BBbUHm4.jpg)


I created a Google Forms document with detailed information on ordering, shipping and product rundowns on it. You can find it here:

[Order Form](https://twitter.com/TucaManMel/status/1080237698277879809?s=19)


I will be attending the Dallas stop and will also have these items available for pickup and for limited purchase then! Everything is $5USD and under! Everything is currently in production and some items are limited in quantity as I had to get the goods ordered in time to arrive to me before the start of the tour, and so that I could ship to you before your concert(s)!


If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me a PM here, through my SNS accounts linked in the form or through email!


Thank you so much for your time! ",12,1

I've been so impressed by it that I have been looking for more clothing, like a sweatshirt/hoodie or beanie/skull cap for the cold weather. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't really find anything interesting.

There's a cap and sweatshirt on the SM Town shop that seems perpetually sold out. Most of the shirts I've seen online just seem like they've taken a square picture and stamped it on a shirt, which I'm not really into.

146,2019-1-25,2019,1,25,0,ajda4d,rkpop awards best gg,JokerDurden,1548342371,""".I think the stickies did had an effect. RV had higher votes per day for five of the first seven days. The first sticky was on the 13th and RV barely had higher votes for that day and the 14th. But not all users will read the thread on the precise days and so for the next seven days Twice had higher votes per day for six of the last seven days. It's too much of a coincidence that they suddenly had a higher per day votes after the sticky was done. The second sticky on January 20th clearly showed the advantage of having them done for a group as Twice had a forty votes lead on that day and a thirty votes lead on the 21st which had never happened before. The highest advantage they had previously was eleven votes. Just because it did not had as much effect on GFriend or Sunmi (also considering they're not as big internationally as RV or Twice) does not mean that the sticky effect could be set aside just like that.

Ok so I did it day by day and I got these results:

RV -Twice -Date

198 187 1/8/2019

78 68 1/9/2019

46 49 1/10/2019

41 39 1/11/2019

20 22 1/19/2019

62 103 1/20/2019

55 86 1/21/2019""

This was my reply to a mod. To be fair to him/her I don't think the stickies had any ill intent. Is my assessment wrong? I feel so disappointed with the award considering RV lost by about 80 votes and without the increase in Twice votes because of the stickies thise could have been the deciding votes. I know the award don't mean anything but since I've pretty much accepted that Twice is the (Korea) Nation's GG I just wanted to get a best GG award for RV. I would have been happy OK if Twice or other GG won but the stickies just make me lose confidence with the votes. ",0,1
