26,2018-6-3,2018,6,3,16,8o6xko,Looking for people to join a KPOP DANCE TEAM!,JLynn7,1528009235,"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review this ad. 

We are looking for people to join a brand new Kpop Dance Cover group. We are looking for dependable, positive like minded people who want to be part of something huge. 
ALL LEVELS ARE WELCOME!

What will the Dance team be doing?
The dance team will be doing public dance covers, dance tutorials for youtube, dancing at events and take part in whatever other potential opportunities arise. We will be dancing in public areas such as Santa Monica Pier, Koreatown, Burbank and any other areas we can go. If the opportunity arises we will dance at events like Ktown Night Markets and any other Korean related festivals or events. 

****Please note we may also learn Jpop and Cpop routines at times to perform at related events. 

What kind of songs will we be covering?
We will be covering songs from all Kpop groups including BTS, UNB, Infinite, Gfriend, Blackpink, MonstaX, AOA, APINK, Big Bang, Shinee, Super Junior, Kard, Ukiss, Vixx, Twice, Cosmic Girls and many many other groups. 

Where and when will we be practicing? 
We will be practicing twice a week at a studio in North Hollywood. Practice will be every Friday at 6pm-8:30pm. Eventually it will move to twice a week once we have enough people. (Most likely Wednesdays same time)

Why should you join?
Why shouldnt you? Honestly there are so many opportunities in a group like this. Here are some of the perks of joining!
Being surrounded by people who love what you do. 
You get to make new friends. We will be your second family!
Are you interested in auditioning for a company? Or maybe you want to get more exposure as a dancer, singer, entertainer? Well this is literally going to be free promotion for you! You will get pictures done, dance in public, and be on youtube. This is a great way to start getting people to notice you! Plus if we get people who can sing, maybe we can sing the songs and dance!
You get to learn KPOP dance routines for FREE!

Requirements. 
Age 18 and up!
Must be dependable and able to consistently attend practice! (It is insanely rude to the other dancers as well as us if you are consistently late or skip practice. It slows down everyone and makes learning a routine much harder.)
Responsible. You will be expected to practice what you learn even outside of practice. This will help to learn routines effectively.
GOOD ATTITUDE and SUPPORTIVE of your teammates. If you are going to get mad when one of your team members has trouble learning a move or have an attitude when we try to teach you then this isnt for you. We want people who will support their teammates and stay positive even when a routine looks impossible. We can do it!



Please feel free to ask any questions.If you are interested in attending please let me know as I will need to rent out a larger room depending on the amount of people who are coming. For this coming Friday (The 8th) I rented out a room for 5 people so I can take 2 more people. (Choreographer, myself and one other is already booked in.) However for future fridays, I can always book larger rooms. 

Hope to hear from you!

Cause like Chungha is really good at freestyle dance as I watched it on Produce 101.Then Lisa and Momo was known to be a good dancer since they debuted.

42,2018-6-6,2018,6,6,18,8oz881,Is 1st and 2nd generation idols irrelevant?,G00Setsuna,1528277259,"Today, internet has changed our world whether good or bad. That does include K-Pop. Once idols were recognised through hardwork and efforts. Now, only fame and popularity concern.
No fighting here, just opinions. 

Nowadays we heard a lot of K-POP from around the world. Either only heard the music to hardcore fans. K-pop has grown big and wide that there's a convention at another country besides Korea. Throughout K-pop history, there was amazing recognition to terrible news. We stand as we all watch and grown to our own favourite group/solo artist. Therefore here we are the K-pop community.

Throughout the old days of K-pop, the genre itself is hard to be recognised by the Korea citizens. The idols need to work hard to be recognised by the community. Their hardships are unknown to us until they speak it up. Some goes up and some goes down. Some even went to certain degree of scandal for the purpose of surviving the entertainment industry.

I've grown in 2nd generation of K-pop. I've seen alot of good and bad things in K-pop world. Those were the days where the K-pop were rising. 
Now days, only fame and recognition were matter. Days and nights is like a battlefield to see who has the most views, likes, followers, trophies and etc. The saddest thing is how the 2nd and 1st generation idols were discarded from current generation as 'Grandfather' or 'Grandmother'. 

How broken my heart as I hear those words. How could you say those who raised your idols to this very day. It saddens me but make me realize that the world is changing in increasing rate.

What about your opinion? Is it ok for the way it is?",4,1

71,2018-6-10,2018,6,10,21,8q0iex,Music Group From The Internet,CrimsonMarvel,1528634108,"Heya,
So straight to the point: I want to make an Asian music group. Now not because I have something against people of other races or anything, I just want to make a music group that represents all (or at least most) of Asia. Now, what do I mean by that? There are so many groups (like Idol groups for example) that are more based in 1 country, but I want to make a group with members from different countries. A couple of inspirations for me to start all this are:

Groups:
Brockhampton (American hip-hop boyband that met on the internet), A huge number of Asian idol groups and 88rising (although that's more of a company)
Solo artists (that personally inspire the music I want to make):
Bruno Mars, Zico (specifically his song ""Artist"") and Rude-

What kind of genre music? Any kind! I think we could be held back if we only stick to 1 genre and sound, and definitely at the beginning we should experiment a lot. 
I'm not incredibly musically gifted but I'm currently learning to produce and I can write songs and I'm practicing rap (still finding my ""rap voice"").
I'm decent at graphic design, film, editing and animation(mostly after effects stuff).
I'm half Indonesian and half European, I can speak Dutch, English and learning Indonesian.

With the music I think we can include both English and other languages in 1 song for example: a song with English/Chinese/Korean or something like that, I don't know a lot of groups that do that and I think we could be unique in that.
I have a lot of Ideas on how the group could work. Personally I would like it to be a more rougher version of an Idol group (Mix between for example BTS and Brockhampton).

What kind of people do we need? Vocalists, Rappers, Producers, Other things music related (people that play instruments, songwriters or maybe a manager), Dancers (preferably also interested in being a vocalist or rapper) and graphic design.
When it comes to visuals it's not really that important to me, but if you think you qualify as a visual and are interested in making music you're welcome!
Don't want to be limited to being just a boy or girl group, both are invited.

For the people that aren't Asian. I'm also thinking about maybe splitting the group into ""west"" and ""east"" groups, so you're still welcome to come and hang out and talk about music.

I created a Discord server for people that are interested:

Please feel free to correct me, add more features, or locations similar to SM as I did limited research beforehand.

  
On that note, I think it would be really cool to implement:

* old music video sets being replicated (such as the clothing shop in SNSD's Gee) where people can walk around and takes pictures in 
* interactive props used in MVs (such as the black car in SHINee's Ring Ding Dong and Red Velvet's Automatic \+ the red curtains in Boyfriend's Witch) 
* MORE iconic outfits (such as Oh My Girl's Windy Day, 4minute's Crazy, and Red Velvet's Bad Boy)
* k\-pop jukeboxes 
* a gallery featuring notable concepts (\*coughs\* VIXX)
* workshops on replicating makeup looks
* LIGHTSTICKS interactive display 
* photocard gallery w/ front and back display by group
* rainbow gallery consisting of albums 

Although it is unrealistic to implement all of ideas listed above, I definitely believe that other companies can pursue their own ""museum"" like SM did to some degree or at least compile some their items (signed albums, old stage/MV outfits, and merchandise) for public display. Ideally I would like to have a true k\-pop museum consisting of items from the entire k\-pop industry but I understand that acquiring everything and keeping up with maintenance costs is difficult.

I asked the community of which track from 2018 I should give a remix,

and many asked for Love Scenario by iKON.

Super  awesome track, I felt in love with it immediately and started working  on it. The track reminded me of a track i made back in 2002. Thats why I  combined the melody from the track with this.

Thank you all for being so kind and suggest tracks, I hope More will suggest some ideas and tracks to remix!

This is the first time for us to go America , so it's really hard to find the information about the clubs or any stage where we can try to get a chance.

If anyone can give any information about this, seriously i need your help!

(we're looking forward to your comments or opinion!)

**Here are 3 songs of our new stuffs.**

I was planning on making my own cards like you would get in albums. But there are so many great photos that I would have too many of them. I felt it would be easier to just put them all in a book that I could rearrange myself. Thought I'd share a few pages if anyone wants to take a look.

https://imgur.com/a/gYzKFMA

This 1st book is only using photos from 2016, since my page limit was only 110. I tried to rearrange all the photos by date but with so many resources, the original dates of some were probably off a little. I was able to cover their profiles, some pre-debut photos, photos of their music videos, some of their photoshoots for magazines, and as many selfies of them I could find. I do plan on making my own book(s) again for 2017 all the way to their mini album release.",1,1
