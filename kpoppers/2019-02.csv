14,2019-2-3,2019,2,3,8,amjqi7,A Musicians Evaluation of No by CLC (),cberm725,1549149817,"DISCLAIMER: CLC is a great group and I wish them all the best. By no means am I trying to demean or lift up anyone by any comparisons or relations. It is simply a review/analysis/evaluation of the song itself.  
 

First things first, I dont like this song. I had mixed feelings about it and I absolutely love parts of it but the parts I didnt like outweigh that to a point that it just killed the song for me. In fact, I deleted it from my Spotify while proofreading this. Now that Ive put my opinions and biases out there and given my two cents on the song Ill be putting that aside and looking at the song objectively.  
 

The song radiates a girl crush concept. Something CLCs transitioned to starting back with Hobgoblin on Crystyle two years ago. The Free\*SM mini-album was a bit of a departure from that but kept a more feminist concept imo (I havent seen the video so I cant say for sure). The song starts with Seungyeon talk-singing Red Lip? NO etc. I dont like talk-singing but here its acceptable and actually I would prefer it as it sets up the mood of the song. If you compare to their last comeback Black Dress, they did the same thing. The song starts with samples of the members saying black before the beat comes in. The same thing happens with No which is sort of disappointing as its not very creative production wise. While the beat is lighter and uses a heavier thumping bass, it doesnt take away from the fact that it feels a bit bland for the first 45 seconds or so. You only have the bass, and the girls vocals. You do have a more trap beat that comes in with Yeeun that adds good substance along with Eunbin before leading into the pre-chorus That Elkie and Seunghee absolutely SLAY that part. The biggest problem I have is the chorus being an improvement on the opening beat with samples of the Red Lip? NO part from the beginning spread throughout the beat. Its not as powerful as the pre-chorus and feels very jarring to a point where it breaks the immersion. The sort of EDM-like beat and vocally suppressed chorus seems to be a theme with some groups lately. Black Dress was the same way. La Vie En Rose by IZ\*ONE and Solo by Jennie jump out to me in recent memory. This style is by no means new but its more prominent recently. LATATA by (G)I-DLE even had a bit of it towards the end of its chorus. It feels very underwhelming and sort of deflates the great buildup to the chorus. Unless Im wrong and Elkie and Seunghee are singing the chorus and the drop, for lack of a better term, is a post-chorus. Either way it has the same effect. It almost seems like the composers/producers were going for an effect that feels like a major departure from the main song but fits well. They only hit one of those points perfectly. The other not so much. A song that does this perfectly is Bboom Bboom by Momoland. Back to No, the beat in the beginning is called back in the chorus with minimal vocals. The only part that I cant draw similarities between No and Black Dress to is the bridge. Black Dress has a much more vocally focused and instrumentally light bridge before calling back some backing vocals and the chorus for a sort of anthem-like ending. The Bridge in No seems like the dance break at the end of Solo. Fast-paced and instrumentally heavy. They do add vocals on top of it but its basically what was said in the beginning. The items they list off are translated as Heels, perfume, Handbag (literally in the beginning), and makeup. The next set is personality traits of Innocent, sexy, and aegyo (no real literal translation). Its pretty uncreative just putting that over it.  
 

Theres not a lot musically to say about this. Im having a hard time determining what key its in but from what Im hearing mainly in the pre-chorus, it seems to be in D Major. It starts on the minor iii with F#m, then goes to the diminished vii C# resolves to the I. The vi Bm is in there somewhere but I cant see why. Other than that. The bass and trap beat pretty much stays with F#m and C# sometimes throwing AM into the mix.   
 

To conclude, it has a lot of similarities to Black Dress which is pretty disappointing after them having almost and entire year between comebacks (343 days to be exact). Then again, its CUBE, and after 2018 my expectations for their artists activities are pretty low. I see where people like this song. I see the appeal of it but I personally dont find it very enticing or creative. The song does have a very proud, feminist message that goes well with the rising feminism movement in Korea at the moment. ",0,1
15,2019-2-3,2019,2,3,8,amjt2d,Ultimate Group Chooser mobile game,Pemtech,1549150283,"Hello kpoppers,

I'm a novice android developer who absolutely loves kpop. I've been a huge fan of kpop for about 4 years now and ever since then I've read, watched and played almost everything kpop related. Finally I got the idea for an app that I think other people would enjoy as much as I do.

&amp;#x200B;

'Kpop Ultimate Group Chooser' is an easy time killing game where you get presented with two images of two different groups and you need to choose between the two. The one you choose stays on the screen while the other group changes into another. You need to keep choosing between your favourite groups until you find out your ultimate group. You might have to make hard decisions but it's all part of the fun!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you'll try my game and give me feedback about it. Also if you have any game or app ideas, I'll be happy to hear them and try to make your ideas a reality if I have the skill required!

&amp;#x200B;

I made a short and crappy demo of this about 2-3 months ago, but I finished the project last month and never followed up here. I've been a big Kpop fan for over a decade, but Bad Boy is one of my favorite tracks of all time. Between the Genius video on the Making Of Bad Boy and trying to get into synth/DAWs myself, I took recreating this song as a challenge and method of learning more.   


I have the exact drum loop (courtesy of the Julez Jadon kits), the exact timing / sylenth1 presets for the lead (via LeLotusBleu) and the chords (via Arksun sound). The original bass uses Trillian, which costs as much as my DAW, synth, presets, and drum loops combined and then some -- so I modified a typical Kpop bass synth to the closest sounding option I could. The snaps aren't quite as nice as the ones used in the original, either. The main thing it's missing, aside from intentionally removing the vocals, are a bunch of small things in the chorus -- there's the police sirens, heys, and some reverse drums. These work well in the original song for sure, but also there's a wall of nearly half a dozen vocal harmonies, and I think it sounds a bit strange if you're some guy or girl singing this alone for fun. 

  
Lastly, I made some minor changes. There's these amazing chords that start with the prechorus that compliment the lead so well... and they're a little unnoticed in the original, so I turned them up a couple decibels to my version to clarify it. The final version of Bad Boy uses a slightly different syncopation for these chords, and I preferred how they sounded in the demo -- so I kept the original timing used in the demo.  I also changed the bass part very slightly in the bridge because the original puts the sweeps on the off-beats, and I changed them slightly to line up with the standard placement for a 4/4 beat (think it'd be easier to sing along with, as well.)   


Vocaroo/YT really lower the sound quality, including some static and popping noises that simply don't exist in my MP3 versions. If anyone is interested in having the song as a back-up for karaoke or vocal cover, feel free to mention it here or send me a PM. I'll happily email you the higher quality MP3, and I can tailor the mix to retaining sound quality or boosting volume for you easily. I'm happy to make any other alterations you may specifically want too (I have .wavs for the chorus sound bytes (siren, heys, etc) for example -- though at this point you might as well just download the original.) Or maybe you want to know what it sounds like with completely different synths, idk. Just let me know.  


Thanks so much for your time!

I recently made a post here about my [kpop game](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/comments/amjt2d/ultimate_group_chooser_mobile_game/) and now I'm back with another app that had been unfinished for a while but now I've finished it! It's called ""K-pop Ultimate Wallpapers"". It has awesome phone wallpapers from over 40 groups, so you can find wallpapers from your favourite groups!

""wouldn't it be great if someone covered Love Scenario? Only, they used a 10$ microphone, replaced the memorable piano with a cheap tropical house synth, changed the synth bass to Cyclone (and bonus points if they don't know how to use this wobble-bass machine), butchered the pronunciation because they're not Korean, chose to rap over themselves instead of buying a decent chorus effect, and didn't even recreate all the instrumentals because they're using a cheap DAW that has a 16 track limit?""  


If so, you're in just ***incredible*** luck! Look no further: [https://vocaroo.com/i/s1dXiban0N5v](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1dXiban0N5v)  


I did my by-the-books cover of Bad Boy a while back, and I thought I'd do a cover of Love Scenario... only, as an experiment to try out my newest effects, presets, and synths I bought with part of my tax refund. It's mostly for myself, but maybe a die-hard fan of iKon or Love Scenario will be able to appreciate the effort, or hear a fan cover of their beloved song sounds like with the instrumentation changed.  


If you have questions (what sample did you use? how'd you get this sound? why do you sound so bad?) I'm happy to answer. In all seriousness, I did try my best, so thanks for the visit. ",0,1

I used to dream about working the K-ent industry, not as idol but as an intern/manager something like that. I know I was crazy back then and I told everyone in my family about this dream of mine. I applied to the companies that were more established in the US, that bridged kpop the most globally MNET, CJE&amp;M but I also applied to actual Kpop companies. I didnt speak Korean very well. I was still taking classes, so I had someone help me compose an email basically asking if there were any internship opportunities for foreigners. I believe Mnet had something like that waaay back, but nothing else was available. Of course no one replied to my cold emails, except one. It was bighit. I dont remember the exact wording but it translated to Thank you for your interest. As of now, there arent any openings but I can confirm with out HR department. Please send your resume if youd like. Thank expressing your interest in our company This was around 2016-2017. I remember jumping up and down from excitement. I know it didnt mean anything but the fact that they replied made me feel really touched. I was a nobody and they entertained a foreigner with a silly inquiry like mine. I didnt follow through or anything with the email. I gave up on that dream. Idk you become more realistic as you get older, but I did make a promise to support BTS because of this. They werent my main group in the past....Dont get me wrong, I love their music! But I made it a point to support them because of their great work ethic, personalities and talent. Also, they have such an awesome team behind them. Idk any other company who is as nice and accommodating to people outside the company/fans. I thought Id share this random story because I came across the other day of an article that mentioned how Bighit had the lowest employee turnover rate,highest employee satisfaction   and how much the company has doubled its employees.

186,2019-2-20,2019,2,20,6,asfxh6,[Repost] What happened with CL's US career? Here is my analasys/opinion. (Spoiler: It is not all YG's fault),OriginalPromise,1550613161,"So CL, the ""ex-YG Princess"", and my first and ultimate bias, announced her US debut on 2014. There were tons of articles flooding out announcing her big US debut, with her colab with Diplo, and her signing with Scooter Braun. On paper, she had everything. She had fat financial support from YG, big name collaberations with Diplo and connections in the US with will.i.am, and top-grade management from Scooter Braun. But why are we still waiting for a damned album 4 (now almost 5) years later? With recent news that BOM is coming back (yay!) and me revisiting 2NE1 due to the news, lets talk about this. Before we get there, here is what I think.

**\*These are my opinions and you are free to disagree and debate. Some of the info here are also my educated specualtion from actual sources\***

1.Scooter Braun didn't do shit.

I believe that he never actively supported CL. He was too busy jerking off Ariana Grande and Bieber and other money makers within his arsenal . For example, SB never promoted her US tour, didn't support her make-up endorsements, didn't say a word for the *My Little Pony* OST, didn't have a clue about CL's big Olympic performance, etc. If you actually think about it, most of the US activities were set up by YG, starting from *Hello Bitches* to *Lifted*. If you go on iTunes and look up the publisher for *Lifted*, it's not ""Schoolboy Records"", SB's label. It's actually YG, and soley YG. Who paid for Paris Goebel and her crew? YG did. Who paid for the Lifted video and studio time, and promotions? YG did. Who paid for all the studio times for the crap ton of songs that she recorded, and music videos that she shot that never got released to the public? YG did. Am I saying that SB had nothing to do with CL and didn't do anything for her? No. I can still see his name and affiliation listed in the credits, and can see the ties between her work and his connections (ex. Paris Goebel's crew was also in JB's Sorry video). But did he do EVERYTHING that he can? Hell no. Compared to the amount of effort and time that went into JB's album, or Ariana's ventures, CL got nothing.

1.1. Scooter said that it was YG's fault and that YG was too controlling but I think it's a big fat lie

SB never mentioned anything about CL on his twitter. If he did, it was because of CL's dedicated fans spamming him to get his attention. But when the news broke out that CL is no longer working with SB, SB decides to ""conveniently"" talk with a fan and have him [leak the convo](https://www.kpopmap.com/conversation-between-cl-and-scooter-braun-suggests-she-is-being-held-back/). Bullshit. He never talked about her activites or cared about them while actively promoting Grande and Bieber, and when her contract is up and getting heat from fans, he decides to talk to one fan and have him convinently ""leak"" the convo. He makes all this press about how she's signed under him and is going to do wonders for her career, then when the apple finally hits the ground, he tells starved fans that YG was too controlling when you already published some of her work under your label? He actively states that she was signed then tells the fan that she never got her papers togehter. It doesn't make sense legally, logically, emotionally, or financially that SB started to work on CL BEFORE all the paperwork was intact. I think this was genius on his part because he kept fans starved about anything related to CL, and finally ended up throwing a bone to crazy fans to cover his ass after taking all the money from YG while doing nothing for CL. CL and Scooter also ""agreed"" that it was all YG's fault, but I think that was CL just putting blind faith in SB and kissing ass that he is going to do something for her one day, when he never will; like he never did with PSY's career, or The Wanted and drove that group into the ground; angering YG and drowning his name in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2.  YG doesn't think CL is able to recoup investment costs

This is pretty self explanitory. YG poured a crap ton of resources into CL's debut. But once *Lifted* launched, it performed badly. It wasn't recieved well in the US with ""only"" 29 million views at the time of writing. So put yourself in YG's shoes. We  can all agree that he's a greedy money hoe, but you invest all this money, time, and effort into CL's debut, but fail to see money coming in. Why would you want to pour more time and effort into what already turned out to be a poor performer? Look at BTS or Blackpink. Did Big Hit and YG push BTS and BP the same way that they did with CL? No, yet they are recieving better reactions and ticket sales. (They didn't even formally ""debut"" yet)  YG saw CL's debut to be a failure and didn't see it getting better, so he stepped out; which I think is totally reasonable.There was a song called *All In* that she leaked\*,\* and also a *Hello Bitches* music video that never got released. He deems CL to be too risky of an investment, thus discontinuing his support for her US activities, which explains CL getting frustrated with YG and the drama caused within.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. CL is too keen on wanting a career in the US, despite a strong fanbase in Asia, costing 2NE1 in the process indirectly

So CL grew up in the US, and I think that the following life experience pressures her to persue a US debut. Korea was always a foregin country to her, and I think she wants to be regcognized at where she can call home. Despite having a strong career in Asia, she decided to persue a US career in 2014, before BTS's success and when Korean artists finding success in the US market was basically unheard of, except for PSY being the outlier. This decision indirectly costed 2NE1 their livelihood, and put their activities on hold. Now Bom's scandal is the main catalyst that forced 2NE1's long hitatus, but I believe CL's debut plans also caused some delays and eventually contributed to the cancelation of 2NE1's comeback, after Minzy left. I also think she decided that her success and fame in asia is not enough for her. Why else would she leave a market where she is already respected and immensely successful in, to a market that no other Korean artist was able to penetrate? She mentioned in an [interview](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/11/cl-sheds-tears-while-talking-about-her-advancement-in-america) that she would never quit until she eventually breaks into the American market. In that interview, Taeyang also urges CL to come back to the Korean market, but she stubbornly tells him that she is determined to have a career in the US. Her personal want for a US debut disallowed her to think logically and  face reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My Opinion: I can personally get behind her dreams and aspirations and it is understandable where it comes from, but I think she needs to be realistic. Statistically, the odds were never in her favor, and now that she has bad blood with YG, I don't see any of the music and projects that she did with YG being released any time soon, and I also think that YG is the only company that could've and was willing to support CL to this caliber. What other company is going to able to back CL? SM, after they failed with BoA? JYP after they failed with Wonder Girls? Smaller companies that lacks resources to even promote idols in the same caliber as the big 3?

I rediscovered CL when I heard of BOM's comeback. 2NE1 was the group that ultimately brought me into K-pop, and also the only group that had a killer stage presence that I think modern groups lack. (Not saying that modern releases suck) And the more I re-read the tweets, her comments in interviews, and think about the situation logically, I personally don't see a one-size-fits-all answer for CL. Many people tend to just scapegoat YG, including CL and SB, but I really don't think that's the case. I think CL landed here in the shitty situation she is in because of all three parties involved, including her.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love CL, but I think she kinda dug her own grave. SB dug it with an excavator, while CL walked in. Shit started piling up within the last 4 years, and YG put the final nail on the coffin when he decided the CL wasn't profitable. I think it's a shame that such a one of a kind talent was burried like this, but wheter CL can dig herself out this year remains to be the question. I guess she can be like SNSD Tiffany and move into another label like Transparent Arts and continue her US ventures, but only time can tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is an **opinion**. Feel free to disagree and reflect on it, and I did specualte to fill in the missing pieces. Not everything may be factual and this is my **opinion**. Please be respectful in the comments as I know this is a sensitive issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for coming to my long ass ted talk.
