but to be honest, I was let down by the song, just the song. The styling, makeup, hair, the GIRLS were so on point and they saved the song. 
The actual song wasn't too exciting....i mean, i was expecting a lot since it involved Teddy and R.Tee but dang I was pretty let down. 
ofc i gave the song may listens but it is still really hard to get into. the song is lacking a lot of bass and there is not a lot of dynamic plus the chorus wasn't too catchy for me. 

What do you guys think about the SONG?

Their debut song is really good, the members are really cool, and they're amazingly stable in their live stages. Not saying that you should stan but you should stan. They're super entertaining too.

Things aside, thoughts of BC have been bugging me these days. I found information on him way before his 1team days and it turns out that he got some hate due to his leading in Boys24 (no wonder Rubin is leader) and bullying incident. It makes me wonder if he isn't as good natured as I think he is. I know he already apologised but I'm still kind of wary.

Don't get me wrong, he's talented and I love all of them but it just bugs me out... I know he probably reflected and changed, if not why would Liveworks want to risk debuting someone with past scandals right? I still have some reservations on being a complete stan yet, although he seems pretty chill and nice... any thoughts?",4,5

I'm a 16 (almost 17) years old boy living in Germany. I'm listening to kpop since the end of 2015. I thought it could be quiet interesting for some how it is to be a fanboy, since the kpop community has a huge female fanbase.
So you can ask me some questions I'll try to answer honestly. I also would have one or two stories I could tell about problems as a male kpop fan caused by our society (maybe more the society in Germany, because I think this whole thing is more ""appreciated"" in the US).
So don't mind asking (if anyone does see this post xD).

I thought I'd try creating a Kpop challenge. I only did four songs because this takes a while, but I'd be happy to do more if people enjoy them.   


*A QUICK FOREWORD:*  
Unfortunately, there's 5-6 short localized moments of squeaking that came along with this: 4-5 on SONG 2 @ the end of ROUND 2 and throughout ROUND 3, and 1 on SONG 4 ROUND 3. Sorry, I have cheap recording software. :\\ But please **do not** listen at max volume or feel free to skip ahead to avoid hearing this (times listed at end.)   


LINK FOR THE CHALLENGE:  [https://vimeo.com/330442540](https://vimeo.com/330442540)   


The idea is in each round for this challenge, a new part of each song is added until there's 6 main parts that create the majority of the main melody/rhythm for a popular kpop song. Round 1 will be nearly impossible to recognize, and each round adds progressively recognizable elements until round 6. If you still can't figure it out after round 6, the acapella vocals will appear shortly after so you can hear everything together.  


I hope someone enjoys this! Feel free to leave comments, like what round you recognized each song (or not), differences in difficulty, etc -- or criticisms. Thanks!   


ROUND 1 0:00 -- 1:41  
ROUND 2 1:41 --  3:22 (SKIP 2:08-2:19 TO AVOID BLIPS)   
ROUND 3 3:22 -- 4:31  
ROUND 4 4:31 -- 5:38 (BLIP @ 4:44 FOR SKIPPING)",0,1
