2,2019-8-1,2019,8,1,14,ckjwat,Anybody Kind of Miss Old-Skool K-Pop?,Lamorosii,1564636144," Obviously, this is dependent on what you consider old school, but I started around 1998 when Shinhwa, 1TYM and SES were the bread and butter of K-Pop. I've been hit and miss with K-Pop that entire span, taking sometimes a few year breaks in-between and I DO like a goodly number of newer groups/releases. However, as a past-time after work, I've decided to go back and listen to as many groups/songs from yesteryear as I can. I've found that I...kinda...like it better? Nothing wrong with the newer stuff, I just feel like new gen is all about the flash, colors and pzazz. There is something just...simple and clean about older stuff. Cheesy? Most definitely, but in a refreshing way. Maybe even awkward. As reference, I've been watching live videos of Deux and been quite entertained. They are literally dancing all over the place and tend to almost run into each other every couple seconds. Am I alone in this? Who do you remember watching and/or miss? Any memories? Recommendations? Again, I've been around awhile and trying to re-introduce myself to the past.",1,7

105,2019-8-11,2019,8,11,1,cokdo2,Z-Pop Dream Project gives K-pop a global spin: Members of Z-Girls and Z-Boys hail from across Asia but are based in Korea,Blackhand82,1565455494," Although their style and choreography scream K-pop - think glittery makeup, colorful hair and synchronized dance moves - theres something remarkably different about groups Z-Girls and Z-Boys. They are based in Seoul, but the groups are made up entirely of non-Koreans and only sing songs in English.   


Collectively called the Z-Pop Dream Project, the two groups are the brainchild of entertainment producers from Korea and across the region hoping to create the next superstars of Asia.   


Ive gone overseas to hold K-pop concerts countless times over the years, but I found that there were aspects about K-pop that my global partners were tired of, said Z-Pop Dream Project co-founder Jun Kang at a press showcase also attended by Z-Girls and Z-Boys held in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Thursday. Kang serves as CEO of Zenith Media Contents, an entertainment company, and claims to be an industry veteran with experience at SM Entertainment, Koreas largest management agency.   


We worked with professionals in the K-pop industry and discovered stars all across Asia. Our goal was to create a K-pop project based on cultural exchanges with many countries, said Kang.  


Z-Boys and Z-Girls each include seven members hailing from different regions: the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Taiwan and Japan. All of them were born in or after 1995, making them part of Generation Z, the demographic the project is targeting.   


The two groups officially debuted this February when they held their first concert Z-POP Dream Live at Jamsil Stadium in southern Seoul, upon releasing their first joint single Z-POP DREAM.  

 Since their debut, the groups have amassed a considerable fan base through multiple TV and press appearances throughout Asia. Ahead of their Seoul showcase, the groups met up with fans and reporters in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines and performed during the semifinal round of The Voice Indonesia. The YouTube video of that performance has garnered over 1 million views, and the official music videos of their tracks Holla Holla and Streets of Gold, released last week, have 1.7 million and 2.4 million views, respectively.  


Creating a completely multicultural K-pop group wasnt easy, Kang admitted.   


There are many aspects that we lack compared to \[other\] K-pop \[acts\], and we faced a lot of language barriers in training and creating the group.   


Although many of the members speak considerable Korean - Z-Girls Taiwanese member Joanne and Indian member Priyanka answered reporters questions in near-fluent Korean - the challenges continue. Ironically, its Korea where the group faces some of its biggest barriers.   


We really want to appear on Korean TV music programs, but the barriers for entry are too high, Kang lamented. Ive been working in the industry for 30 years and have many connections, but music shows tell us that they want K-pop and Korean songs and that our groups dont fit in.   


I disagree with what they say, Kang continued. If in other countries, television shows broadcast people of diverse cultures, why must we sing only Korean songs here?   


If the members felt stressed about the challenges they face, they certainly didnt show it during the showcase on Thursday, their first for Korean press. On Thursday, both Z-Girls and Z-Boys were all smiles, enthusiastically performing tracks from their new single and talking about their favorite K-pop stars like U-Know Yunho from TVXQ and Taeyeon from Girls Generation.   


The producers have even greater ambitions for the future. They are already planning to form multicultural boy and girl groups every year, expanding the range of regions the members represent. Also, they plan to use an Ethereum-based digital coin to facilitate purchases like concert tickets and merchandise.  


Z-pop started with the goal of giving hope and dreams to young audiences, Kang said. We tell the members in our groups that they are representatives of their country and that they can return to their homes and teach younger generations the techniques they learned from Korea.",0,1

Compared to somi, I really love chungha. I absolutely adore her. She has everything - the vocals, the dance skills, the stage presence. All of her songs so far have been absolute bops and they are so powerful and they match her image. Not to mention that all her outfits are amazing too.

Based on many resources there from the cosmos. 
Here comes the heroes - DAVID . 

Plot: 
A dark force lingers in the sci-fi and mythical world of K-Pop, as chosen guardians are anointed the powers of nature to save the earth and the future of Kpop from  a  dark smoked being from the cosmos. This villain is also rumored to be a Marvel Villain. 


With the success of A L E X  , there will be a full team of heroic guardians. They will each have solos then meet up and each music video is presented as a film. 

After Alex is Baekho. 

Meet DAVID or alternative name the power of DAVID. Alex Kinchen a rookie K-pop singer who havent debut since his predebut in 2009-10. Will debut with his first mini album ; BROKEN PROMISES also known as Fire and Heart  As we learned Alexs fandom is called Roosters and Cranes and Davids is Stars. 

David from DKDKTV.news mentioned a
Similar Concept for Super M, very ironic how that is so when this plot was secretly and public released weeks or month ago. 


Hopefully Alex dose the disappoint.

While browsing Reddit and YouTube, and having heard about all of the toxicity on Twitter and probably Instagram and Snapchat and all over Social Media in general it has become a common misconception that K-Pop fans are crazy, overly obsessive, rude, toxic, and downright insufferable by society, inside AND outside of social media. While this may be due to the overall rise in popularity it has been receiving as it spreads more and more and non-fans are just starting to take notice of it once again or are being introduced to it for the very first time, I think it is our responsibility to represent the K-Pop fandom as a whole in order to help it's rise in popularity become something that's internationally ACCEPTED and not DISGRACED or hated upon simply because of the fandom it possesses.",1,2

Would any of you find it strange to see an adult fan have their room decorated in kpop related merch? Growing up, I was moving in with so many different people so fast that I was never able to have my own bedroom that I could personalize, so now as an adult, its so important to have a bedroom that really makes me feel happy, comfortable and safe. I guess my biggest worry is having someone come over and see my bedroom, and thinking Im child-like for having kpop. Right now I only have my albums and a couple posters hidden behind a sliding closet door (so I can open the closet and have the posters covered if needed) but Im moving out soon and Im really worried about this. Also, any ideas to maybe add subtle flares of kpop are also welcomed",6,3
