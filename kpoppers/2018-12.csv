In my case, I have only one: Min Yoongi. I consider him my ultimate because I admire him not only as a musician but as a person. His voice and his simple presence make me feel something, not sure what but it's heartwarming. Of course I find him extremely attractive, but I don't think that's the main reason I have such a strong ""connection"" with him, clearly. I genuinely care about him; everyday I hope he's doing well.

In the other hand, soloist rapper Giriboy makes me feel quite the same way BUT I don't consider him an Ultimate bias, mostly because he's a soloist.

I'm curious about the criteria, specifically, of what people consider an Ult.",0,1

About a year ago I started traveling for work, and I have pretty manageable anxiety; but flying REALLY gets to me. I LOVE to travel and Ill get on a plane and be okay, but when I experience turbulence, internally I freak out. I tried downloading shows on Netflix to my iPad, watching the in flight movies, playing my Switch, etc. while these could entertain me, nothing took away my anxiety; Until, YouTube Music. On YT Music you can download music videos for offline viewing later. The amount of calmness and okay I feel when flying and watching Kpop is honestly something Ive NEVER experienced before. I dont freak out in intense turbulence anymore and it has really made me okay with traveling. I just wanted to share that with you guys and maybe help someone if they have some anxiety as well. I cant speak for everyone, but KPOP has definitely helped my anxiety and thats a beautiful effect that no other form of music has ever had on me. ",3,1

most of my argument goes for bts. i know that bts isnt the whole kpop community/fanbase, but im specifically keeping bts in mind. 

im a korean boy who generally loves all types of music. my mother grew up in korea and she agrees with me that its great that korea, a small place is getting hugely recognized. however, theres a problem. there are people out there who are oversexualizing these people, shipping them together and making very disgusting indepth fan fictions about them. i personally dont have anything against korean music, i do not listen to it though because of fanbase giving them a bad rep. the fact that we also have a huge beauty standard for the women in kpop is also disgusting, but i guess thats been normalized over the years. 

anyways, if you want to add onto my argument or rebuttal against me, feel free to do so. im using my freedom of speech. . thank you. 

TLDR; kpop fans are bad because they oversexualize my culture. ",12,1

&amp;#x200B;

2018 was a good year for Kpop. These are all my opinion and I welcome yours as well. I mainly only listen to GG so i'm biased there. Also I love many more songs that came out this year, but these came into my mind first.

1. **Hwasa - Be calm**: Beautiful, personal, intimate and Hwasa has a beautiful voice. This was perfect and one of my few 10s this year.
2. **Taeyeon - Circus**: Beautiful singing in this one. The background singing part may take a bit to get used to, but it's a special track. Also a very interesting meaning. It was popular enough that an official English lyric video was released. I can't wait for more of her music.
3. **Red Velvet - Bad Boy**: One of those songs that I couldn't stop listening to. Had a very good beat, choreography, and the singing was excellent. Everything just flowed well vocally, as well the underlying beat.
4. **BLACKPINK - (DDU-DU DDU-DU)**: One of the catchiest songs of the year. I love this group and this song was pretty strong in all its drops and mixing and all. Excellent rapping, singing and choreography. Forever Young comes pretty close but that was more top 20-30 material for me.
5. **Sunmi - Siren**: Such a strong song. Sunmi is such an amazing singer too. I loved the old school sound of the backing track. It reminded me of when I started listening to kpop around late 2008 or so. Also has quite a good meaning in the song.
6. **Apink - I'm So Sick**: This song was such a departure from their usual cute style. I found it to be excellent though. I'm really hoping their January comeback is more this style. I listened to it nonstop for quite a while. Plus whoever did the backing track with the singing on it is a genius.
7. **Mamamoo - Wind Flower**: Grew on me very quickly with a catchy beat, excellent vocals, and a strong message. Also some of the funnest choreography I saw this year.
8. **(G)i-dle - Hann**: After a very successful debut song the group floored me with this one. It really showed an excellent shift in their sound after what some may say was a safe debut song. So much good singing here and there is an excellent flow to the rhythm and sound. A group to look forward to in the future.
9. **fromis\_9 - Love Bomb**: This is actually one of the catchiest songs of the year. A cute message and honestly some relatively complicated singing. This one was stuck in my head so much after it came out I knew it was special. Another group i'm expecting bigger things from.
10. **Oh My Girl - Secret Garden**: A very pretty song. I love the meaning of it and I can just listen to it because it flows so well. Also the ladies this year had very improved vocals.

Just Missed: Twice - What is Love, EXID - I Love You, Twice - Yes or Yes, So many Mamamoo songs....

Bonus: A non kpop song that is a 10 from me is **Mitski - Nobody**. It resonated with me to an extreme degree and her whole CD is easily album of year material.",14,1

179,2018-12-21,2018,12,21,17,a87w05,A Musicians Evaluation of The Best Thing I Ever Did By TWICE ,cberm725,1545379898," DISCLAIMER: I am NOT bashing on Twice or being intentionally harsh in this evaluation/critique. Twice is my favorite group of all-time and I love the group to death. I am a proud ONCE and do not have intentions of demeaning any of the girls nor any of the JYP staff and whomever they may have hired in the process of making this song. It is simply a review and evaluation of the song in of itself.  
 

To start, I will say that personally, I dont like ballads at all. I see the appeal of them but my personal taste is more upbeat and something I can jam to. Opinions and biases aside, I will be reviewing/critiquing/evaluating/whateveryouwanttocallit-ing The Best Thing I Ever Did.  
 

The Best Thing I Ever Did is a very sweet and heartfelt ballad that suits Twices youthful and cute concept and also meshing nicely with the holidays. The song isnt emotionally driven and isnt a very powerful ballad. Rather it goes for a more laid back, relaxed feel that most ballads go for in their more mature, powerful and vocal focus. Twice doesnt suit the traditional ballad style which is what makes this song stand out. The more mature style of a traditional ballad would make it feel pretty awkward as a Twice song. I honestly cant think of a song of Twices that fits a more traditional ballad style. Be as ONE, Someone Like Me,  Turtle,   Jaljayo Good Night,  Ice Cream, One in a Million, Say Yes, and Like a Fool are their more ballidical songs. They all have a very poppy element to them. And while that is a solid number of tracks, the only one that I can see really fitting a ballad style is Be as ONE with its very heavy ballad style. The opening piano, soft harmonical vocals, drawn out chorus, the whole shebang makes it feel very much like a traditional ballad, it lacks the bit hit in each chorus and only has one about 70% of the way through the song. And the buildup and end to it are quite poor in my opinion. Think Ailee How Could You Do This to Me for an example. She always hits with super strong vocals and the chorus is clearly the big part of the song and she shows the hurt that is explained in the song. Now I dont know the meaning of Be as ONE but it doesnt have that hitting element of a traditional ballad. I know I got off topic so I digress.  
 

Back to the original topic, Best Thing as Im going to dub it for now, doesnt fit that style at all and is more of a pop ballad. Pop ballads tend to have lighter instrumentals and have a deeper underlying meaning to the song, at least from what Ive heard. Best Thing has a very unique, minimalistic instrumental with the piano, bells, literal sleigh bells, a soft drum set, and theres even shaker and tambourine if Im hearing it correctly. The song seems to start in F Major with a progression of I-iii-vi-IV (F-Am-Dm-Bb) with a V (C) chord sprinkled in at the beginning. The Bb chords 3rd is lowered from an E to and Eb making the chord Bb minor which isnt conventional, but isnt exactly unheard of either. Its a very subtle change and maybe Im not hearing it correctly. I dont have my keyboard nearby as Im out-of-town visiting family. Although they have a piano, its been at LEAST 20 years since its been tuned, and its kept in the hottest (or coldest depending on the time of day) part of the house. The Bridge changes to C minor with the same I-iii-vi-IV (C-Eb-Bb-F) progression which allows it to flow nicely back to the original key. Overall, I really like the instrumental and how well it flows. JYP never ceases to produce great songs and have a solid musical foundation to them.   
 

As for the vocals, theyre also very soft and well played out. Sana and Momo were the members that really stood out to me in this track. They seem to be more in their range compared to other songs where they seem to be in the higher register of their voice which causes strain on their vocal chords. Its specifically noticeable in Momos voice as she sounds a bit raspy and nasally more often than not. In this song her voice is super clear and crisp. Sanas vocal range in this song just sounds more natural. It seems as if shes always singing in almost a falsetto range in most of their title tracks and trying too hard to sound cute. The range of the vocals as a whole isnt that wide but it does modulate very nicely and fit the girls well. I wasnt blown away by the vocals but not necessarily impressed either. They seemed to be on par for what I expected. Nothing in the vocals stood out and had that WOW factor.  
 

Overall, the song is good. Great even. Giving my personal two cents, I like it and its one of my favorite pop-ballads. Im not a huge ballad fan, but I LOVE this song as it is. Its lighthearted, fun, and gives you that warm feeling that you might feel when cozying up with a nice book on a cold winter night next to the crackling fireplace. I know thats specific but thats what I envision. What really gets me in this song is the instrumental. It drives the song by not having super drawn out piano or bells. Its always moving and thats what I love. It moves the song around and doesnt lull me to sleep like a lot of ballads.  
 

Ok. Im done. Im sure I would have more thoughts about the song if I had actually taken more time to go over the song and given it more time to develop but I wanted to get this out there while its still relevant. If you have any comments or suggestions, Id love to hear it and discuss further. Ill take any (constructive) criticism that you may have. Again, Im not trying to demean anyone, just doing a bit of a deeper dive into a song. I dont see much content like this and I thought it might be fun to experiment with the idea. Please let me know if youd like to see more content like this. Thanks! !
