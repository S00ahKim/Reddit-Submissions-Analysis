26,2018-8-4,2018,8,4,8,94ejs1,My Opinions (from my tumblr + extra),kpop_dont_stop,1533339102,"\*Zico and Jooheon could easily outrap half out my bias groups rappers (and yours too)

\*Umji and Kyla are queens

\*JYP needs to give 25% of Nayeons lines to Jeongyeon

\*Momo should sing with her original voice

\*Being underrated and underappreciated are two different things, people call groups underrated too much

\*If BlackPink did have a leader it would most definitely be Jennie

\*Companies need to stop debuting idols at the age of 13 and 14

\*While I do fuck with NCT heavy I feel like SM ifs gonna fuck them over with the infinite members thing.

\*Out of all of the groups in kpop somebody has gotta be gay

\*85% of people that react to kpop songs only do it to make money (all shade) and dont give a rats ass about the kpop community or genre

\*SEVENTEENs softer concept was a smart move, but my china line boys still need lines (not just adlibs)

\*WJSNs line distribution is one of the worst in kpop

\*Most people only appreciate Wonhos body, not his talent

\*CLC is underappreciated af and Liar is a bop

\*Smut about animals/hybrids is weird as hell....

\*Kpop fans arent as problematic as people say, people say ignorant shit and try to play victim

\*People who write/read smut of minors shall burn in hell

\*When people said that Nayeon was TWICEs fake maknae I saw surprised because Chaeyoung seems more like shed be the fake maknae

\*I prefer TWICE's sidetracks better than their title tracks (woohoo, eyes eyes eyes, next page, ect)

\*TWICE needs more rap parts than just 10 seconds that gets split up for two rappers

\*Idols shouldnt be allowed to perform in the rain (one day someones gonna get an extreme injury)

\*Ahin of Momoland needs more lines

\*Out of the big 3 JYP is the best and SM is the worst

\*If Hani were to ever leave EXID shed be an amazing mc

\*SEVENTEEN is top 3 when it comes to variety (with DK, Seungkwan, and Hoshi)

\*Crack videos arent that funny to me

\*Signal was not trash

\*Companies need to stop giving groups sexy concepts if theres still minors in the group

\*Weekly Idol&gt;&gt;&gt;Idol Room

\*Seeing an idol doing aegyo is cringy asf especially if they do it for no reason",1,0

I entered a competition that my work, Starbucks created with Spotify. Starbucks partners have to come up with the best summer playlist. The two most followed playlists by August 11 win the top prizes which is having their playlist played in 8000+ Starbucks stores! I really really want this. K-pop is my love. I want to show it off to the world, especially on the job, lol. I spent hours curating a really fun summer playlist, one that will appeal to non listeners of K-pop. Theyll never know whats coming to them! Theyll get hooked! I have Western pop and EDM songs for variety. I would really appreciate if you followed my playlist. I really only hear K-pop at boba shops and at Korean restaurants and I just think it would be wonderful if K-pop was more public. Imagine we would be seeing K-pop in more places.  Probably K-pop stores would start opening up. Its just a start. Im in desperate need of more followers, so please follow and share! Thank you!

They as well according to multiple websites have been getting death threats. So to stop this petition it would be really nice if people who have twitter to tweet or any social media about the situation and show your support with the following hashtags:
#HereforPentagon
#EdawnandHyunaGotMySupport

It would be really nice as both of these wonderful people actually are staying true to fans and have admitted about the relationship. Hyuna has found someone she has generally liked and both love each other.

What would you say are rules and standards that kpop group subreddits should always follow? Which ones would be good to have but aren't absolutely necessary? What would you say are the cardinal sins that should be avoided? Does the answer to any of these questions change depending on the size of the subreddit?

Do you love kpop? 

Do you want to put them together? 


Join our team today! We're looking for writers to help us compile a basic card deck for Cards Against Humanity - Kpop Edition! As long as you can crack jokes and put them down on paper, we'd love to have you! Every fandom is welcome - after all, no group is exempt from the (probably) roasting. If you're interested, pop us (either /u/Sowon_Impersonator or I) a message and we'll get crackin!

In case you don't now what CAH is, here's a little spiel written by /u/Sowon_Impersonator \^^:

CAH is a game played by 3+ people. Each person has a hand of white cards, and can draw one every round. Every round, one person picks a black card with a question or fill in the blank statement on it, and the other people must present a white card from their hand that answers the question or fills in the blank. Whoever drew the black card gets to pick the funniest answer, and the person with the funniest answer gets a point. This continues until a point limit is reached, which you can set yourself.

A few examples just so folks get the gist of some black prompt cards and white answer cards:

&gt;[BREAKING] SM's new girl's group concept rumored to be __.

&gt;Monkeys allergic to bananas getting around their allergy by drinking milk

&gt;Heechul in a wig doing girl group dances

&gt;Cheesu Kimbap

&gt;[AMAZING] This year's ISAC will feature the new sport of __.

&gt;Idols dating other idols

&gt;Running through an airport with sasaeng fans chasing you

&gt;Telling yourself ""Krystal's hair in Nu Abo wasn't thaaat bad"" out of pure desperation""",4,21

A group of people who sing and dance, doesn't have to be in Korean, as long as they perform while singing and dancing at the same time, because I'm curious as to how that'd turn out.

I was just thinking about this since I was thinking of making a Kpop company. ",13,5

So music, concert ticket sales, merch, awards... gone.  Overnight. And they can't release anything new. She also makes it so that nobody can become a trainee at these companies and forces every single existing trainee to leave. The remaining artists keep promoting. That's the way it is for three years until someone defeats the witch and everything goes back, the groups that disappeared have their status reinstated and things go back to the way they were. If the company's still there, of course.
My question is: how fucked is your bias group's company? Does your bias group still exist? What consequences do you think this would bring?
