54,2019-10-5,2019,10,5,20,ddm5c5,"I am a black 14 year old girl and my mother is on board with me working to become a trainee, what do I do next?",SkylorRose,1570275756,"Let me start this post with a couple of clarifications:

1. I am aware that the likeliness of me being accepted as a trainee is extremely low and the chances of me debuting are even lower, however, I might as well try.
2. I am currently learning Korean.
3. I do realize and understand the risks of being a trainee and idol.

Now that that is out of the way, I can start. After I got into Kpop, it wasn't long before I started learning some choreographies and of course, they're difficult but not too much so as I used to be a dancer a couple of years ago. However, as I started getting more invested in Kpop and South Korean culture in general, as well as starting to learn the language, I realized that I was becoming more interested in having a profession that involved Kpop. Ultimately, I've decided that I want to become an idol. Now, I know what you're thinking by now, the whole ""Oh, it's just a phase"" or ""There are plenty of children your age who dream of what you're dreaming of,"" and to that I say, fair enough. It is true that there are plenty of kids my age who want to do the same thingI'm trying to do, and that's why I want to do it. I want to show them that it's possible albeit difficult. I want children and teens to see me one day and know that it's possible, and I'm willing to try and fail as many times as I need to. For example, Alexandra Reid. Of course, we know how that turned out and she was treated more as a token than anything else, but she showed me that it's possible to get up there, and if the right company with good intentions takes a chance on you, it could turn out well.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I told my mother that I wanted to become a Kpop idol and she told me that she supports it, and this weekend we'll look into what we can do. I've already begun to learn choreographies, change my diet and run. What should I be doing in the meantime? What next?

Thank you for reading this post, I will take your comments into consideration and give updates when I can :)",3,10

I hope I can post this here. 

I wrote a k-pop-inspired novel called, **Reminiscing**. I'll post a synopsis below. I'm not a self-published author, I have a publisher, but I'm trying to get my book out there because **I know** a lot of people will like it!

On top of that, I am hosting a K-pop giveaway to go along with it. You can find contest rules [HERE](https://tierrawritesromance.com/reminiscing-giveaway/).

**Synopsis:** 

https://i.redd.it/pm68tsj18yq31.jpg

 KyuBeom Yoon is known as the ice prince of the renowned K-pop group, C4. All he wanted was to get away from it allthe lights, the cameras, and the fame that comes with being an idol. And all he wants is Maya Campoy. With Maya, he gets the chance to feel normal, to be loved, to be happyand so much more. Unfortunately, things dont always go as planned. Years later, he finds himself on a radio show reliving a tale of love and heartbreak, wondering if, at the end of it all, shell give him another chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked pretty hard on this novel, and it's relatable and funny. It has 4/5 stars on Amazon and Goodreads so far!

#1:song releases
Blackpink seem like they drop an EP every now and then with pretty good songs but it's like starving yourself for a week and then proceeding to eat an average size meal at a fairly expensive restaurant yes the food was good but you're left wanting more but guess what? You have to wait an entire week more to eat again look all I'm saying is they need to be allowed to release music on a consistent basis and I'm not asking for an album every 1-2 months but at least 3-4 months would do quite well

#2:Solos
YG...YG YG YG...where the hell are the other 3 girls solo songs? Is it under the table along with all the other scand...you know what nevermind almost got carried away anyways look all we want is the solo songs cause the way things looking right now they're never coming out and that concerns me cause this goes back to the whole thing I was saying about the fancy restaurant what if they're good songs but dont be worth the wait  man

#3:potential 
Blackpink by how diverse all 4 members are have so much collab potential they could honestly record a song with asap rocky then turn around and record one with ariana grande but their label holds them back immensely,trust me they know it we all know its true

Maybe when their YG contract is up they'll decide to become independent artist cause that's the best route I think they can take considering just how talented they are cause in the end true genius knows no restraint

I have always found that Spotify is unfair with their 'This is XXX' playlists of TWICE and Red Velvet ('This is BLACKPINK' is fairly decent). So, I made this playlist with each of theirs top ten tracks sorted by popularity and slightly shuffled to give a fair chance for every track. This playlist automatically updates itself ten times every day. Hope this is useful for people who want to get into Kpop and long time listeners alike.

I am a director of a project called Orbital, which is a non-profit project focused on making a website for Orbits, by Orbits, or anyone interested in LOONA in general. Our goal is to create an environment that provides everything that fans want in one place! This includes articles, news, entertainment, events, information on voting, introductions to LOONA members, theories, and much more. We hope to continue to grow and improve upon these features by listening to the fandom and our trusted team.

The reason we are contacting Reddit is that, too develop the project further, we are looking for more volunteers who are interested in and willing to dedicate themselves to the project. Currently, we have the most need for members of the Tech department. We need those who have knowledge of React, Angular, and/or Vue.js. If you have other applicable knowledge, or think that you would be able to quickly and accurately learn any of these programs, please also consider helping out. 

If youre interested in working with Orbital please dont hesitate to fill out our [application form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6WbZKTnnCqZCJiQ9Ik1Xx_DhwuptyuqTLpS4pKdSGIHowMA/viewform) If you have any questions or doubts please feel free to contact us on our Twitter account ([@orbitalwebsite](https://twitter.com/OrbitalWebsite)) or feel free to DM me directly or comment down below. If youre not interested in working with Orbital but would like to follow the site and its progression please follow our Twitter!

I realize that not all of you are Orbits, which is completely fine! As long as you don't have a vetted interest in bashing LOONA that's all I ask. There are incredibly talented individuals across all kpop fandoms, and, honestly, I want to access as big as a pool of potential applicants as possible. 

I would like to thank the mods here for allowing me to do this bit of promotion, and thank you to all of you for your time!",2,16

I will not take sides. No, I will not try and convince you to change your mind on anything. I just want to know about you, and why you're an anti.

You can decide whether or not you would like me to share the interview anywhere online - and your name will be censored.

This is a long shot but if you are reading this &amp; you do go out of your way to post negativity against celebs, do consider reaching out to me via private message. I'll keep the interview mature &amp; on track so long as you do me the same favour.

Thanks for your time on reading this &amp; I hope you consider.",8,10

i've been into this shit for around 8 years. two of the most exciting years in kpop for me musically were the years 2012 and 2015, so i decided to waste my work shift curating a playlist for both of these years.

i should note that the 2012 playlist is missing 'I don't need a man' by Miss A and 'Stop Girl' by U-KISS. (the latter is one of my favorites from this year UGHH)

i'm also considering doing 2011 since that was also an exciting year (and the year i got into kpop!)

if you're a long time kpop fan like myself i hope you derive great pleasure from these playlists!

also i partly used the wikipedia page to pick these out so if i'm missing anything PLEASE let me know and i'll add it right away!!

Because of his love for K-pop, this was the theme he wants us to produce.

Our batch produced covers for #EXO, #TWICE, and #IOI. Links below 

Hope you guys enjoy~

For the IOI fans: One group in our batch produced a music video cover for ""Whatta Man""! This is the group that I participated in. Hehe~

For the ONCE out there: Another group produced a music video cover for ""What is Love?"" by TWICE! There's a big twist here: our precious nine girls are played by guys and it's really hard not to laugh for their acting.
