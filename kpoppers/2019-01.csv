though the jennie/kai news hasnt been confirmed yet, i thought it was a out of the blue, especially since i wouldnt have put them together as a couple (but best of luck to them). i was just wondering which idols you guys think would make great couples.

im not talking about which idol pairings are shipped together because they wear the same sweater or made eye contact at an award show, im talking about which idols you think would make great couples in terms of matching personalities, hobbies or even mannerisms. it doesnt have to be romantic pairings either, id love to know what friend pairings you think would work!

ill start: i think hani and chanyeol would be a pretty awesome couple! they both seem super goofy and very spontaneous and i feel like they have a similar sense of humor. let me know what you guys think!!",1,1

As I was thinking about them today, I was trying to come up with a list of my Variety All-Stars. Id be interested in hearing who your funniest idols are!

My list (for now):

Hong JinYoung - because shes freaking hilarious and adorable 

SooYoung (SNSD) - the several appearances I have seen for her on Running Man, she has shown quick wit and a great sense for comedic timing - would love to see her in a more permanent variety show

Yoon BoMi (APink) - Bomi kills it every time. Her stunts as co-host in Weekly Idol especially.

Who you got? :)

*I want to stop competing*  
*Competition at school, competition at work. When does it stop?*

I am a K-pop survival program enthusiast. I love the story of participants battling one another and overcoming fierce competition. A series of survival programs in South Korea, the start of which was Super Star K, has produced a number of prominent artists who are acknowledged on the global stage. They are positively affecting the brand image of Korea and contributing to the national economy. Some people are enthusiastic about this phenomenon, while others say that survival programs encourage excessive competition.

I also tend to focus on listening to singles rather than albums and I think Im missing out on some great music

Things I mostly think these days are how kpop became different from kpop about 10\~5years ago.

Girls generation, T-ara, Secret, Miss A and whole lot of girl groups was at that era.

And I think hundreds of songs came out then was much varies and has its own color.

But bands these days, i think its really 'equalized'. I mean, I cant find any difference between them.

For example, in case of Girls' Generation' s &lt;Gee&gt;, can you even imagine secret or T-ara sings that? I cant.

But, in my case, i cant feel any discomfort if i imagine that red velvet sings twice's &lt;TT&gt;.

Girl groups today are mostly concepted with common image, and same sense of beats.

I think there're also effect of current music trend of TRAP music and retirement of original producers make beats feel common.

And I think thats the reason why many middle-size entertainment's bands are not really powerful compared to the past.

I hope girls groups going to debut after days have more various concepts and styles.

I really miss that era of kpop",11,1

Bit of backstory, whilst I had an extensive list of groups I adored you couldnt beat BTS for me (its so weird seeing them in mainstream media now though) and I swore down that Id never love someone as much as Kim Taehyung. I got my first year college roommate obsessed with them as well (Luckily she was a Jungkook kinda gal) and we had artwork and stickers posted EVERYWHERE in our house. It was great. 

Fast forward and now Im 21, living with my partner, talking about the prospect of marriage, finishing my degree in popular music and left that life behind. Im writing an essay about authenticity and Ive chosen to use Kpop as a subject as to why we dont need authenticity in our lives. I watched Save Me to write some notes about the sampling technique. Started writing, finished it crying my eyes out like the baby I secretly am and I know this means yet again, Im back. For fuck sake ",1,1

I was given the rare opportunity to do an assignment in my university course about kpop and the significance it has made globally. The assignment is focused more on culture and about youth/adolescents, but I appreciate any responses. I'm desiring to get a general understanding about why people follow kpop and how they find they are perceived by people around them.

Thank you so much for taking a few minutes and filling this out!

Instead of giving out awards for the ""best of K-Pop"", these awards will be for the strangest, funniest, and downright worst of K-Pop in 2018.

**How to nominate and vote**

Categories for the Razzies can be anything your hearts can imagine.  So the first step is to post whatever category you want in the comments below.  Then other users (or even you) can add nominees to that category.  Be sure to include pictures and links when appropriate.  Everyone else upvotes the nominees they want to win.  Check out [last year's Razzie Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/comments/7p1edy/1st_annual_rkpoppers_razzie_awards_2017/) if you need ideas or feel free to re-use your favorites.  At the end of the voting period, we'll take the top 25 most upvoted categories and announce the winners on r/kpop (for real this time).

**The voting period will end on February 5th at around 11:59 est.**

Remember to have fun and don't be too mean.  We will definitely be poking fun at idols and groups in this thread, but it's not open season to completely trash them or their fans.  Comments that cross the line will be removed.",267,1
