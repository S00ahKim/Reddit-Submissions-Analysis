My friend is new to reddit so I'm helping her out. She's a huge fan of kpop and kdramas but she lives in central Florida where there's not much support/fandom. She created a Youtube channel so she can connect with more fans and I'd like to share her stuff so she can get more exposure. 

If you live in the Orlando area, please let us know if there are groups/clubs she can get involved with so she can meet more fans! And it would be super cool if you could check out her videos and maybe like/subscribe to them if you're interested. 

[Here's her video discussing how she got into kpop and wants to know how you got into it too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVX9BzI3cW4)

[This video is how she got into kdramas, which lead to her love for kpop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWpCa7xRqw4)

I should mention she is a HUGE fan of BTS. 

Her username on reddit is [InfatuKated](u/InfatuKated).

Between r/bangtan and r/kpop, I feel like I've seen a decent amount of self-admissions of some degree of mental illness. This makes me feel two things: 1) yay solidarity!!!! 2) awww lots of people aren't feeling so good. It was World Mental Health Day 2017 on Tuesday, so this has been on my mind.


I figured we could share resources to help each other out. I'm sure there will be days when you're too ""tired""/tired and/or have too too few [spoons](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) to add a rung to that ladder, so maybe the posts that accumulate here can be an easy rung :). Please offer up one non-kpop thing and one kpop thing.


I'll start: For kpop, I usually watch a Bangtan Bomb, this one of [Jimin trying to make Jungkook laugh](https://youtu.be/kAnTcz1cCAQ) is especially helpful. For non-kpop, if I can manage it, I go to a park. If not, I watch cooking videos on YouTube since I really like cooking so it's kind of like I'm doing it???


Take care of yourselves, r/kpoppers!",6,10

I don't really listen to K-pop myself, but I figure this is a good place to ask this question:
Has anyone else noticed the amount of misandry within the k-pop community, specifically coming from many teen girls?
Like almost everytime I see some misandrist post on Instagram, Twitter or anything, like ""men are trash"", ""i hate men""  I go onto their profiles and almost every time they have some member of a k-pop band as their profile pic or in their posts. They don't seem to hate the k-pop guys they post about, considering the ""JASKDLASDA I LOVE HIM SO MUCH""  yet they say ""i hate men"" and ""men are trash"" 
I can't be the only one who's noticed, this, so, anyone?

**2.)**  Get LIVE Role
    Go to #bias_picker and add LIVE role. We will ping you shortly before the show starts.

**3.)** Watch on Rabbit
    On Sat. 9:15 PM KST, go to https://www.rabb.it/sekl to watch the show and chat with everyone.
     If the room is full, we will ask a volunteer to open a second room.

**4.)** Read Live-subs in Discord
    In our discord server, go to #live_translations to read live subs.
    Our awesome Translators team will try to do as best as they can, but remember it is still 100% by volunteer by other members.
    Don't forget to thank them afterwards!

**5.)** Live Party Voice Channel
    If your wifi can still handle, we also have a Live Viewing Party VC for those interested.


Week 1 will be an experiment for all of us, so feedback in #suggestions afterwards would be appreciated.
That's all! Get HYPED, and enjoy! 

**Feel free to stay for:** 

-Live Chatrooms / Fast Updates / Fun Facts / News about about the show

-Channels with content for each individual participant / group

-Watch the show together and chat with other kpop fans &amp; More!

Come join the hype in anticipation for EPISODE 1!!
