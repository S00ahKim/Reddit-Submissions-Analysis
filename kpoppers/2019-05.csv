Now yes, this is just for fun, some rambling from a random fanboy of BTS  and K-Pop and also theyre tv shows  but that doesnt mean I cant cast out a little spicy net just for fun. 

PREDICTION #1 

East Meets West: The Queen of Pop w/ The Golden Boy from Busan 

Now Ill be honest with you, this is FARFETCHED  Nah, more like a Fanfiction  but Ill be honest, these two looked cute with each other, then again when two beautiful representatives collide with each other, its really more of a force of nature rather than cute couple. If you dont know what Im talking about, its Jeon Jung-Kook and Ariana Grandes #Flawless photo-op that was bestowed by the Instagram gods on my feed. Why do I think this? In simple terms, they would be a FIRE couple, like JayZ and Beyonc FIRE. In my terms, its just a gut feeling, itd be comparable to the royal couple of Meghan Merkle and that British prince (Harry?) 

PREDICTION #2 

Daegu boy snaps with a full fledged solo album 

I just need a big hit labeled solo album by Suga pls 

PREDICTION #3 

Mochi also goes Solo

No indication this will be true, but Jimin going solo as well. If I could get an album with the same vibes as Serendipity and Promise Ill be forever indebted to you Jimin-nim.

[What can Crypto learn from K-Pop and Justin Sun?](https://i.redd.it/hdukk3m6o1y21.jpg)

K-Pop band [BTS](https://bts.ibighit.com/eng/profile/index.php) were No 1 in the UK and US music charts in April 2019. Justin Sun's [TRON](https://tron.network/about?lng=en) was ranked No 11 in blockchain at the time. So, what can Crypto learn from Korea's most successful K-Pop export and from blockchain's most brazen self-publicist?

Which artists do you like that deserve *so* much more? And why?



I'll start:


Speed: probably the most underrated bg in the history of Kpop 

Their songs? Total bops

Their choreos? Iconic and insanely good

Their concept? Speed circus was iconic ngl

Their vocals? That high note in what u speaks lengths

Their stage presence and live performances? Damn

Thank u mbk for being a shitty company and disbanding them after not promoting them",16,9

So a friend of mine went to a Stray Kids concert last night in Houston and says she has post-concert depression. Idk if it means anything or its just slang but Im gonna rant about it. Why the hell do fans get depressed after a once in a lifetime Stray Kids concert?? Or ANY concert for that matter. Stays who did go, I hope you had a great time and are happy that you went. Post-concert depression is nothing compared to real depression (which Im diagnosed with sooo I guess dat is why I posted dis). Stray Kids want you to be happy that you went and not depressed that its over. Dont be sad bc its over, be happy that it happened.",4,2

Some friends and I are looking to put together a dance group to learn the choreography to Butterfly by LOONA: https://youtu.be/ADJorSdTRCI

There are 12 people in this dance and 3 of us already. We are looking for at least 5 more members to dance along with us,  at the most 9 more people so we can have everyone in LOONA. 

Our goal is to learn the dance and participate in a dance competition at Holiday Matsuri, an anime convention that takes place in December. So we have plenty of time. We are located in the Orlando area so please be close by! You DO NOT have to be a kpop or loona fan to join us as I myself only really like Loona lmao. The dance just looks really fun and we're very interested in putting it together. 

Please join us!!! It can be so much fun! Please DM if you have any questions at all, 

Thanks!",0,4

I've been practicing alot...but...I dont think it's good enough. Please rate me out of 10 and itll be helpful to tell me what are the bad or good parts of my singing. As for the high notes, I've done scales and manyvocal exercises but I just cant strengthen my head voice. My voice also tends to he very unstable. I dont know how I can fix that.
