1,2018-09-01,2018,9,1,13,9c0bg5,Serendipity (Full Length Edition) by BTS (Jimin) REVIEW,JTMedia_Official,1535775662,"Alright, so I am not going to lie, I am not a huge ARMY. Like the only songs that I listen to from BTS are their main, title tracks, like DNA, Fake Love, Blood Sweat and Tears, etc. But I actually died when I heard this song. Who knew how good Jimin's vocals were? Like WTF. Anyways, slight spoiler, but this song earned like the third ever perfect rating from me, and the other two were from Blackpink which I absolutely love. Anyways, if you could check out the review, that'd be AWESOME. This subreddit has been super supportive and the content you guys make is incredible.

Check out my thoughts here: [https://justintalksmedia.blogspot.com/2018/08/kpop-83118-serendipity-full-length-by.html](https://justintalksmedia.blogspot.com/2018/08/kpop-83118-serendipity-full-length-by.html)

Also, because I can only self-promote once a week (but I post like 3-4 times a week), it'd be awesome if you gave me a quick follow on twitter here: [https://twitter.com/justintalkmedia](https://twitter.com/justintalkmedia) . It only takes like five seconds and you can stay updated on my posts, and it would mean a TON to me. My user is @justintalkmedia if you just wanna search me up.

My initial reaction was: ""Oh cool, they modified black on black and used it for this!"". Then I noticed that there were less than 18 people on the stage, and that EXO was singing a rock version of MAMA, a song released in 2012.

After checking the date on the video, which is December of 2016, I realized that before releasing Black on Black, NCT must have been practicing it for at least a year and a half!

Today I was watching [Classical Musicians React to Stellar and Kevin explained the last chorus perfectly](https://youtu.be/yUXOWGHaTB8?t=4m53s): they changed a minor 3rd to a major 3rd! The world makes sense now!

My name Khoi, I'm a College student looking for other people's opinions on how K-Pop came to be 
I'm doing this for an assignment that I have, so any help or ideas will be greatly appreciated.

My 3 thesis statement are: 1.How K-Pop transform from a traditional Korean music to what we know today, 2.How did K-Pop gain it's popularity (i.e: Gangnam style,...etc), 3.How it's gaining more popularity as of now and in the future

But yeah, If you would kindly write down how you guys know about K-Pop, How did your friends came to known it, or just input on what you have that related to those 3 statement I would really adore you.

Btw I know I could've just google it but I would still like what people on here think how it came to be.

Do you think that we can market groups enough so that the fans can be obsessed like Korean fans/fandoms are? I'm really interested in music business and also the way Kpop fans/fandoms are. I really like how Kpop is (business wise in this sense) and really want to know if the USA or any western counties can emulate what the Kpop companies are doing without necessarily totally copying it?

He opens Reddit, his primary source of News, and sees the post. Reading through the Comments he realizes that it is not fake and that they have actually been kicked. Him being a 200 IQ Genius he realizes that this will cause Cube to go Bankrupt, which would be devastating for all of his Friends. His fellow Pentagon members, [G]-Idle and CLC, their carriers would all be ruined. He cant let that happen. He reads the time of the post on Reddit, ""5 hours ago"". There isn't much time. But it isn't too late yet. He grabs his Resignation Papers which he had already prepared weeks ago, knowing this moment would come sooner or later. He gets dressed and takes a cab to Cube Entertainment headquarters. He arrives at the front door entrance. As time is of highest importance he doesn't bother going around to the Employee entrance at the back, and just rushes in the front door. Him being Hui the security let him through to the Elevator without any questions. He Presses the top Butten in the Elevator, Floor 25. This is Park Choon-Min's Office floor. The Elevator arrives at the top. Hui rushes out and bursts open the Bosses door without knocking. Park Choon-Min is sitting at his desk with a live graph of the Cube Ent. Stock on a screen in front of him. Its pointing down. Hui slams the resignation Papers on his desk. ""Bring them back or I leave!"" Hui screams, ""You know that if I leave your Company is doomed to go Bankrupt! You have no choice!"" Park Choon-Min stands up from his desk and walks over to Hui. ""Hui, you can't do this to us! We practically raised you!"" Park Choon-Min says with a loud but scared voice. ""NO, you don't do this to us. We carried you! We brought this company to where it is now!"" Park Choon-Min sits back down at his desk. Looks at the Graph of Cube Ent. and whispers: ""Okay god dam it, Ill bring them back."" Hui turns around. ""There we go! Enjoy floor 25 while it's still yours."" Hui says with a calm voice. He walks back to the Elevator with a smirk on his face. Because he knows, who the real boss of Cube is.",0,0

Hi everyone!

Recently two of my fellow Ahgase friends &amp; I made a GOT7 Discord server for fans to meet, chat, and chill out. We are currently small but very friendly, and we welcome everyone! [**Click here**](https://discord.gg/Gr37D3t) **if you would like to join.** Lets chat about the comeback (dropping in less than 2 days)!

In case youre not familiar with Discord, its an app for text and voice chatting. It allows ppl to easily share photos, videos, gifs, etc.

In our server we have:

* a bot that notifies us whenever GOT7s VLive, YouTube, and Insta accounts update
* a music bot
* self-assignable bias roles
* individual member channels
* a memes channel

P.S. Credits for the art go to [@marbledcoffee](https://twitter.com/marbledcoffee) on Twitter (One of my friends that started the server with me)",0,5

The Characters are mbased on fandom names, colours, and interactions ets. With a little sprinkle of lyrics from some group songs. This is very limited (only 5 fandoms) but i think it would be really cool if others made similar puzzles about other fandoms .

Here goes:


..........A......... is a tall, lean, blond boy with shoulder length hair that's normally in a ponytail. Has a thing for soft pastel colours which is obvious in his choice of clothes. He's rather gentle, soft and uwu at times. Really easygoing with only few enemies. His girlfriend is A smol goth-rocker chick called - ........B......... 

This Pink-haired girl and .......A....... have known each other for a long time (they were born in the same hospital, in the same month), but only recently started dating during the summer. Sometimes she's misunderstood by others but ........A........ has almost always been there to explain and clear things up. 

They're both sophomores now and not many people know of their relationship yet. 


They have a third friend called ........C........ She's got green eyes and is a bold and nice older friend to the two of them. 

But the thing is, somethings up with ..........A......... Recently, a Freshmen has caught his eye. 

........D.......... another smol girl who always smells like cherries and limes. She's can also be a crazy little bomb at times. ..........A.......... periodically finds his eyes straying towards her. Does he think of cheating? No. 
But she has his attention and he feels very supportive towards her. Her older brother ........E....... was very nice to him before graduating last year.

But then again, he's a nice guy, who sometimes makes others peoblems his own, and this worries .......C....... Sometimes. Because due to this niceness, .......B....... is showing some signs of Jealousy. She doesn't want him talking to other people. 


Someone has a crush on .......D....... Nobody knows. But she's like a flower to him. And he feels like a loser around her.

It just struck me that most Maknaes seem to find it hard to socialise in school and that just makes me sad for some reason. 

These babies never have friends within their peer groups.  Ever. And it seems the younger the debut age the worse it is. Worse still is when the maknae is the only one in his/her age line in their group. 

Then again, I'm sure they do make good friends within the group eventually. But during the initial years, there might still be a bit of formality and loneliness. 

Or am I wrong and do I only know of those having/that had problems socializing? 

Edit: It's just that I undeestand how awkward it can be sometimes and they dont really have a chance to get past that quickly due to their busy schedule and status.

ALSO REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT TASTE IN ARTISTS.\***

**""Distance"" by CLC** 

I have to admit that at the first listen of the Black Dress album I loved the title song just a bit more than this B side track. However I probably played ""Black Dress a bit too much, and my interest for the song just wasn't there anymore. Since that happened this song has become my favorite song on the album. To be honest I never thought that the song would ever get a music video, but it did and it's really well produced. The whole mature concept for this song is something I would like to see more within the industry, and it seems to suit the girls really well. Another thing to add is that this song reminds me of their previous song ""Where are You ?"".

**""Secret Garden"" by Oh My Girl**

Oh My Girl is one of my new absolute favorite girl groups out there right now because their vocals just know how to make me feel calm. When I saw that this song was among the few that were released early this year I knew that this year was going to be great for Kpop as a whole. It's has been over 5 months ago since the song came out, and I still love playing it over and over again. I think the reason why this is their best title track yet is the fact that there is not a rap anywhere to be found in the song. A song doesn't necessarily need a rap for it to be good and this is great example of that statement.

**""Paint Me"" by Mamamoo**

In my personal opinion I always believed that these girls were always great from the start of their carrer, but of course not everyone sees them that way. For those whose are concerned about the controversy they are known for I'm fully aware of it. I don't condone them for what they did but I still enjoy their music along with fully knowing that they are capable of learning their lesson. Anyways back to mentioning the song, I like what they are doing with their image. For the lonest time most of the songs they did had a retro vibe to it and I loved that they had made that apart of their whole concept. However, I respect their choice to change their image and branch out to other concepts and genres. This song is a great start for a new beginning for the group and I fully believe that their carrer will continue to be successful.

**""Good Evening"" &amp; ""I Want You"" by SHINee**

I have been a fan of several groups over the last 6 years, but my love for SHINee has always been consistent. Every single song that they ever produced was outstanding in my eyes making me believe that these men could never do anything wrong. When Jonghyun committed suicide last year a part of me was feeling that they would go on a long hiatus in order to recover from the tragic loss of their fellow group member. Despite losing an angel, they probably felt the best way to honor their friend was to keep on singing even though he was no longer with them physically. When I heard that SHINee was going to have a comeback in late May I was super excited. The music video finally released and I was pleased once again with their amazing vocals. At first I thought that was the only song they were going to come out with but then they dropped their second mini album for the year only a few weeks later. However that is not the end of it because they are going to release part 3 really soon. Both main title tracks from part 1 &amp; 2 are complete jams and I cant get enough of either song. Of course these guys really know how to adapt to the current sound because both songs suit them so well and doesn't make it seem like they are trying hard. 

**""Only One You Need"" by Jonghyun**

The fact that SM Entertainment still released Jonghyun's last album is really touching. Jonghyun meant a lot to so many people especially to his fellow group members. Among all of the members he surely did have a unique voice which lead him to have a successful solo carrer separate to his carrer with SHINee. It was sad to hear that he left us but this entire album was like a big thank you for all the fans supporting his work. I picked this song in particular because of the lyrics ""I wanna be the only one you need"". Songs like ""Shinin"" and ""Before Our Spring"" of course are dedicated Shawols in general but this song is more dedicated to Shawols individually. 

**""Lazy"" by EXO-CBX** 

To be completely honest I am not the biggest fan of EXO as a whole but for some reason I am a big fan of the sub unit EXO-CBX. The main reason why I love the sub unit so much is that my bias from the group, Xiumin, has more opportunities to shine and show off his voice. EXO is an amazing in their own right but I am so glad that SM decided to create the subunit. With their new mini album I think it's unique how each of the songs are themed around each day of the week. This song in particular is mentioning about a Lazy Sunday and how being ""simple is sexy baby woah"". In general this song is so relaxing and peaceful and I have to say this is the best song on the album.

**""One Shot Two Shot"" by BoA** 

People seem to be always contemplating who the real Queen(s) of Kpop is/are. Some people say that is Twice, 2NE1, IU, or Ailee, but in my opinion I believe the real queen of the genre is BoA. She has been in the industry for over 15 years and officially started her carrer in 2001. Now I like the other artists that I mentioned however she just has a special place in my heart as a solo artist. I always found her music to be so upbeat that it makes me wanna dance to it. This song was no exception because the background music is so much fun to listen to, and when I watched the music video it made me want to learn the choreography.

**""Go Away"" by Jun Hyung Yong**

Highlight is another group that I don't really stan but I don't mind their music every once in a while. Despite the fact I actually don't mind some of the members individually like Junhyung or Yoseob. This song truly introduced me to his voice and made me recognize how unique his voice is on his own. Overall the song is relatable and the lyrics portray the scenario about two people falling out of love accurately. Unfortunately this kind of situation happens sometimes, and it's good to have a songs to represent that. I think that having it be a upbeat kind of song helps give it a more positive outlook in general. 

**""Selfish"" by Moonbyul &amp; Seulgi**

When I heard that a couple of the members of Mamamoo were going to branch off and kickstart their solo careers I was completely ecstatic. Honestly I didn't expect Moonbyul to get a solo mini album because most people seem to talk about the other three girls more. Another thing I was excited to hear was that Seulgi from Red Velvet was going to be featured in the title track. I think this choice was pretty outstanding not only because she is really popular with in the fandom but also have a general interest with each other's music. Not to mention the music video is super cute and funny and it really shows how close they are as friends.

**""No More"" by UNI.T**

Where do I begin with this song? The way I found out about the song was on one of Kville Entertainment's videos. I honestly did not think I was going to like this song as much as I do. At first it sounds just like another average sexy concept song but after a couple of listens my opinion changed very quickly. Now every time I hear this song I automatically put it on repeat and can't get enough of it because of the killer vocals. Not every debut is unique and super special but I have to say this is an outstanding debut song for an underrated group. It's a shame that these girls have not been brought up in conversation within the Kpop community a whole lot because they are really talented with the potential to go big. 

**""Lost in the Dream"" by Monsta X** 

As much as I love title songs it often seems that a majority of the B side tracks are better. When Monsta X released this album I wasn't automatically sold on it because I didnt really like Jealousy. But of course I never like to judge an album just solely on the main song they decide to produce a music video for. This song stands out the most on the album because it sounds darker than a lot of other songs they recorded. I mean the intensity of the music alone really helps sets the feeling for this song but when it's paired the passionate vocals of the members it just becomes 10 times better. 

**""Jenga"" by Heize**

For the longest time I never really payed attention to Heize because her music never really suited my taste. Somehow I just watched the music video and I instantly liked it because the concept was really cool. The song sounds like something you would hear in an old timey jazz club which I think is such an underrated concept. Also in general this is one of those songs that you can listen too when you are trying to relax because her vocals are soft and peaceful. Now I am not 100% certain if I am going to stan her but if she makes more songs like this it's very likely that I will.

**""Love4eva"" by LOONA**

A lot of people of think that I only listen to Kpop but I still listen to Western artists, and one of those artists is Grimes. Her style of music is so eclectic and unique which is the main why I love her so much. Then the announcement came out that she was going to collaborate with Loona and I was suddenly overwhelmed. I couldn't have asked for anything better because this song is so outstanding and everything works so well. Honestly the techno music suits this specific sub unit of Loona and if one of the other two did the same thing it probably wouldn't work in my opinion.

**""Alone"" by Black6ix** 

Ever since I saw the music video for the song ""Like a Flower"" I just was hooked on this group's music. They just debuted last year and they have 3 absolutely catchy title songs which need more appreciation. I've still yet to know all of their names but I can definitely tell there is a great amount of talent present. This song is a little different than the other two songs they are known for but it still a pure joy to listen to. Even though it is not really an official ballad it's a nice change to have a softer song in their collection. However there is only one thing that didn't really suit this comeback and that was the music video itself. It wasn't terrible but the production could have a lot better. Anyways if you going to give this song a chance listen to the song without the mv.

**""Scentist"" by VIXX**

My list wouldnt be complete without adding a song from the Concept Kings themselves. I always look forward to seeing what their next comeback will bring because I know I won't be disappointed with any concept they choose to do. This comeback along with last year's might have not been necessarily dark or edgy but it's because of their versatility that they earned their current title. What I like most about this concept is that they are portraying themselves as Aromachologists (googled this term) in order to recreate the beautiful scent that they experienced while meeting a lovely lady. 

**""Baby"" by The Rose**

K-Rock is a genre that I don't dwell upon that often because for the longest time I just had no interest in it. That all changed when I discovered CNBLUE and my curiosity peaked for the genre. However they were the real K band that I cared about for a while until I discovered the boys from The Rose. Something about them reminded me about CNBLUE and I decided to see where they would go with their carrer. I am not fully apart of the fandom yet but if they keep impressing me like with this song I know I will become a loyal fan. One random part of the song that a lot of people seem to like that I also enjoy is where one of the members sings the lyrics ""Clouds are shrouding us into the dark"". Those lyrics are sung so beautifully that is what sold it for me. 

**""Broken"" by TVXQ**

I really can't help but mention the two gentlemen that make up this group because they are legendary. Since they both had been out of the military for some time I had really been looking forward for them to have a comeback and they definitely killed it. This non title track stood out to me because it's one of many songs that talk about the harsh reality of love. Love is not an easy thing to experience and songs like this need to exist because it's necessary to recognize both the good and bad. Even though the lyrics are really sad the melody is still really beautiful. Something ironic to note about this song is its placement after the track ""The Chance of Love"" which is an upbeat positive song.

**""You &amp; I"" by Dreancatcher**

Since I have been giving K-rock more of a chance these last few years I always wondered about a girl group who could be considered apart of the genre. Then Dreamcatcher debuted with their killer vocals and outstanding eerie concept. Unlike most K-bands these girls actually dance, and there is nothing wrong with that. To me this is their best song yet and is the song that introduced me to them. The way this song plays into their eerie concept is that the other girls are trying to rescue their fellow member from an evil spirit. Once the spirit has been released all of the girls are being chased by said spirit and are trying so hard to escape its presence. I personally love these darker story for music videos because it is a good change.

**""The Reason"" by Got7**

With Got7 being one of my of ultimate bias groups they hardly ever let me down when it comes down to their music. Despite this fact, I am going to say the truth by saying that this last album was not their strongest album. I still enjoy listening to it though because there are a few songs that make it worth listening to. This is the 3rd track on the album and being completely honest it's the best song. I love how you can tell each individual's passion when they're singing along with the emotional lyrics. Even though there is a little rap within the song it does not take away from the meaning the song portrays. ",3,22
