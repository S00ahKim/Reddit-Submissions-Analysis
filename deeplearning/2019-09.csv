If you're willing to understand how neural networks work behind the scene and debug the back-propagation algorithm step by step by yourself, these slides should be a good starting point.   


We will cover deep learning popular applications, the concept of the artificial neuron and how it relates to the biological one, the perceptron and the multi-layer one. We'll also dive in activation functions, loss functions and **formalize the training of a neural net via the back-propagation algorithm.**   


In the last part, you'll learn how to code a fully functioning trainable neural network from scratch. In pure python code only, with no frameworks involved.

It has enabled researchers to train and test object detection quickly and efficiently in their respective works. However, I found that few of the beginners still feel hesitant to train YOLO on their own dataset due to limited knowledge of data annotation in proper format.

Thus, I have open-sourced my data annotation toolbox for YOLO so that the researchers and students can use it to build innovative projects without any limitations. This toolbox, named Yolo Annotation Tool (YAT), can be used to annotate data directly into the format required by YOLO. All you need is to create a label file containing all the class names to be trained.

Dear colleagues, how are you?

I'm an inorganic chemist doing my PhD using metalorganic molecules. In such molecules we have exotic geometries around the metallic centers and the organic ligands. As I can see, representation of organic molecules is very advanced at this point even with the use of one-line notations like SMILES to simplify how the molecule is represented. The problem with such notations is that they are unable to preserve any geometric information.

In my work, I'm looking exactly at the importance of geometry on some chemical properties, So I have created (and I'm still feeding) a large pandas dataframe with detailed geometric description of the molecules but, so far, I have noticed that none of the representations I tried is able to do MOLECULE &lt;==&gt; REPRESENTATION (I never get my exact molecule back after vectorization).

Are you aware of any method that can preserve the molecular geometry after vectorization?

Thanks in advance for any comments or suggestions.",9,12

&gt; These are simple Google searches, or I dont know if theres a particular book Id point out. Just to learn about deep learning. Learning about neural networks.

&gt;  
&gt;Another thing I wanted to say about if someone actually wants to get into it, its actually remarkably easy to learn. When I said its weird labor market, arbitrage is, I dont think it takes more than six to eight months to become a real domain expert in this.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you dont have to be spectacularly good at computer science before. The background is just so different from normal computer science that, arguably, a new entrant has a great opportunity to just learn how these things are trained. And forget about normal computer science.

Figured I'd come to the (Reddit) source for this. Given the vague context at this point in the interview, does any particular resource / starting place come to mind? General thoughts on what he was getting at? For example, his quote about beginner salaries of half million dollars sounds high, but he may have had something very specific in mind.

I'm making a gradual career change, and ideally I'd be able to at least start bringing in a little income sooner than later.

**So I am stuck between 2 ideas for a science fair, and I need a second opinion**

**Idea 1:**   I wanted to use a Reinforcement Learning Model in order to simulate traffic situations. The agent would learn how to control a network of cars stuck in deep traffic in order to increase efficiency, and reduce the amount of harmful gas released into the air. After making this model, I wanted to make an app, or an extension of google maps, that would be controlled by the agent in real traffic situations. The agent would advise the network of drivers to go at a certain speed and time to increase efficiency, and potentially reduce the amount of accidents made in traffic situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Idea 2:**  I wanted to use a CNN, or other types of networks to determine what type of skin disease, or abnormality a person could have. Using the trained model, I wanted to make an app to make this technology easily accessible to all people. Many people cannot discern between different skin conditions, making early response in the medical field hard. People do not know when to approach a doctor or when to buy an ointment without a doctors discretion. Early response is critical for skin cancer patients.

If anyone could offer advice on which idea I should go with, and additional advice on different methods I could approach these issues, that would be a huge help. I also want to know how I would go about the first idea, as it doesn't seem as feasible to make as the second idea. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.**",2,0

* if the simplicity of a model trained from scratch only to classify person/not person (relative to a full ImageNet pre-trained model) would give a high enough inference time performance yield to warrant the additional training cost
* what are peoples' experiences adapting various pre-trained networks to become single class (specifically people) classifiers
* what are people's experiences running conv net inferences on a Raspberry Pi 3 and/or 4 

In the past I have trained a YOLO model using a VGG-16 conv net pre-trained on ImageNet data to predict bounding boxes and classes for 10 different types of classes... 

This model was, at inference time, able to run at about 3-5 FPS on a Nvidia Jetson TX 2 processing 1080p video.

I'm about to undergo an endeavor which, to be brief, is simply a person detector...if I can achieve 3-5 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, that would be excellent.

My plan is to either train a conv net from scratch or adapt an ImageNet pre-trained model for my purpose and then use this conv net in the YOLO architecture to predict bounding boxes for people.

I understand that there will be a difference in development/training time and cost but my expectation is that it won't be _too_ much of a difference considering the resources I have.

My expectation is that:

* a conv net built just to detect people could be much leaner than a pre-trained ImageNet classifier
* perhaps retraining a large pre-trained net would be approximately the same amount of training cost as compared to a from-scratch conv net which has a likely much simpler architecture
* inference on a leaner model will be considerably faster
* classification accuracy will be higher on properly trained from-scratch model built specifically for people classifying versus a bulky pre-trained model built to classify 1000 classes

My fear is that:

* I'll get sub-satisfactory performance from initial attempts
* by the time I get good performance, I'll have iterated multiple times and spent ultimately a lot more time
* and, by the end, I'll have an architecture not too dissimilar from a fully-fledged ImageNet trained model (i.e. inference gains will not be apparent)

Does anyone here have experience comparing performance of trained-from-scratch single class conv net image classifier and repurposed pre-trained models to do the same task?

Does anyone have experience comparing different pre-trained models when repurposed to classify just people?

&gt; We present Poly-GAN, a novel conditional GAN architecture that is motivated by Fashion Synthesis, an application where garments are automatically placed on images of human models at an arbitrary pose. Poly-GAN allows conditioning on multiple inputs and is suitable for many tasks, including image alignment, image stitching, and inpainting. Existing methods have a similar pipeline where three different networks are used to first align garments with the human pose, then perform stitching of the aligned garment and finally refine the results. Poly-GAN is the first instance where a common architecture is used to perform all three tasks. Our novel architecture enforces the conditions at all layers of the encoder and utilizes skip connections from the coarse layers of the encoder to the respective layers of the decoder. Poly-GAN is able to perform a spatial transformation of the garment based on the RGB skeleton of the model at an arbitrary pose. Additionally, Poly-GAN can perform image stitching, regardless of the garment orientation, and inpainting on the garment mask when it contains irregular holes. Our system achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on Structural Similarity Index metric and Inception Score metric using the DeepFashion dataset.

# Introduction

I recently discovered the Mithril.js JavaScript library and wanted a project to build up my skills with it! I ended up going with a simple web app for visualising and editing network models which I've named [netbrix.ml](https://netbrix.ml). I've wanted to build something like this for a while since it seemed like a really good project to improve my web development skills and my understanding of the process of building deep learning models. After reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/coifgi/the_modularity_of_deep_learning/) on /r/deeplearning where the writer gives insight into the modular nature of deep learning and gives the analogy of a deep learning 'lego set' it gave me the motivation to start work on this with that sort of vision in mind and I've now got a decent working web app! 

I'm sure there are existing tools similar to this in existence, so I wanted to keep it as simple as possible and not try to over-engineer it. It's meant to be easy and simple to use!

# Importing Models

It has some cool features at the moment, like the ability to parse `Sequential()` model definitions in Keras e.g.

    test_model = Sequential()
    
    test_model.add(Conv2D(64,(5,5), activation='relu'))
    test_model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))
    test_model.add(Dropout(0.25))

(Alternatively you can paste in Keras JSON definitions from for example `test_model.to_json()`)

Once that simple model definition is imported it will be parsed by the app to create the following neat visualisation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/imns28k5cll31.png

# Editing Models

From here, you can make all the typical changes you would want to make to a model, including changing/adding layer parameters, adding new layers, changing the order of layers and removing layers, all without having to rely on Google to find the names of layers or their attributes. It can then be easily exported (or copied to the clipboard) with one click as either Python Keras code or a JSON spec which can be imported into Keras. 

# Building Models

It also has some nice features for building models from scratch, like the ability to add blocks of layers that come up in models frequently. Often it's easy to forget the exact optimal order of layers for say a Convolutional block e.g. should pooling come before dropout or vice versa, and what about BatchNorm? Having preconfigured blocks of layers to choose from when building a model helps with this.

On top of that, just having an easily indexable list of layers is useful in itself. 

# Browsing Models

There is also a host of existing model architectures for a variety of machine learning tasks/datasets to explore and this is one of the most helpful features for me personally. Having an easy and centralised way to access a bunch of existing standard model architectures to take inspiration from is really useful! Rather than creating a model from scratch, you can find an existing model on the site, change say the input shape and a few of the hyperparameters and export it as working Keras code in just a few clicks. It's also great for learning about the different architectures commonly used in building models.

# Planned Features

* Integration with TensorFlow.js to have some kind of in-browser training/prototyping
* The ability to share your own model architectures
* Support for variables. Currently you can specify meta tags for a model like 'name' and 'source'. It would be cool to be able to specify variables in this same key/value fashion to allow even easier tuning.
* Better mobile support. The site is relatively responsive at the moment, but not perfect. Hopefully you're not building Keras models on your phone to begin with, but it will work if that's something you wish to do 

So, I'd love to get some feedback on this project! Is it useful? Do you like the design? I'm open to criticism, this is primarily for me to learn

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is the questions:

1. I don't have enough data, since both machine learning and deeplearning needs a lot of data, how should I do? I know something called data augmentation. But since these data is not similiar compared with the real scenario that data augmentation used for, I'm not sure how to augment these data. 
2. I know there is a traditional way to detect, but it is slow and low accuracy. Since there is distortion and background color. Is it deep learning suitable for this? If so, how? If not, why and what is the best way to do such thing?

Many thanks!

I hope you're all doing good. I have a couple of questions concerning Deep Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and video analytics.

I am very new to Deep Learning and any advice or detailed explanation is highly appreciated.

The first task I have is to build an ASR for my own language. I did my research and found the following tools on github:

Deep Speech, Wave2letter, Automatic Speech Recognition (by zzw922cn) and Kaldi.

What I really want is to train my own language model (Say We are talking about spoken arabic, or any other language). How to get started ? What is a robust tool I can build ? Should I build my own RNN-CNN-LSTM (which I have no idea how to build) using Tensorflow or it is better to use an out of the box one of the open source tools ? 

The requirement is that I need to deliver this as fast as I can.

The second task is to have a tool to perform video analytics. Meaning I need to detect anomalies in videos. Let's say I want to automate detection of people, strange and anomalous event (Like a car accident, a robbery, ...). What is the best way to go about this given my humble background ? An in depth step by step solution to this problem with hints on how to build my own models using Tensorflow or any library is highly appreciated.

The final question is that do I really need to understand how CNN, RNN and LSTM work if I need to build my own Tensorflow models ? What is a reasonable timeline to perform these two tasks (Just as a simple proof of concept, nothing very fancy).

I also have a keras model that works fine on a single machine but I want to train it in a distributed mode because I want to test it with a huge dataset and with a bigger number of layers. There is quite a lot of pages discussing the distribution strategy in tf.distribute, but at the same time there are a lot other pages showing how to do it with encapsulating keras model with an estimator, setting up the TF\_CONFIG parameter and then call tf.estimator.train\_and\_evaluate. I used the second approach personally as it was more straightforward and am struggling to tune and debug it. It works anyway, but I am very confused what is the point in all of strategy-related stuff as I don't see any use them in the second approach, and the documentation is not helping to clear it.

I also have some doubt if my file setting environment is correct: My understanding is that the PS server is going to hold the model parameters and the chief server is going to administer the whole training process, partitioning and distributing data, and saving summaries and checkpoints. So I assume that:

1- The main code for PS, Chief, and Worker machines should be exactly the same, except in TF\_CONFIG definition that defines the task and index for that specific machine.

2- I should have one shared copy of data in a folder available to all chief and workers.

3- I should have one shared log directory accessible by all machines as defined in tf.estimator.RunConfig.

4- Having this setting then a piece of code such as below will do the job (assuming the model has been defined elsewhere and the read\_datasets function returns features and labels for running the model):

    runConfig = tf.estimator.RunConfig(session_config=config, 
                                    model_dir=log_dir,
                                    save_summary_steps=1,
                                    save_checkpoints_steps=train_steps)
    estimator = tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(model, model_dir=log_dir, config=runConfig) 
    train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(input_fn=lambda: read_datasets(...), max_steps=epochs*train_steps)
    eval_spec = tf.estimator.EvalSpec(input_fn=lambda: read_datasets(...), start_delay_secs=1, throttle_secs=1)
    tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator, train_spec, eval_spec)

Although the above approach seems to work fine, I have still some difficulties understanding how the chief is partitioning the dataset among the workers and how to set the train\_step and batch\_size in this approach. Also I don't know how can I report accuracy and other metrics such as precision/recall/F1 in addition to loss when running the tf.estimator.evaluate  without writing a custom model\_fn for my encapsulated keras estimator.

Any help is greatly appreciated.",0,1

# What is [torchdata](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchdata)

I would like to present you a new open source PyTorch based project ([__torchdata__](https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchdata/)) which extends capabilities of `torch.utils.data.Dataset` by bringing `map`, `cache` and other operations known from `tensorflow.data.Dataset` (and actually a little more than that).

### All that with a single line of code: `super().__init__()`

For more, check [documentation](https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchdata/) or [github repository](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchdata).

# Functionalities Overview

* Use `map`, `apply`, `reduce` or `filter`
* `cache` data in RAM or on disk (even partial caching, say first `20%` RAM and the rest on disk)
* Full PyTorch's [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) and [`IterableDataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset&gt;) support (including [`torchvision`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html))
* General `torchdata.maps` like `Flatten` or `Select`
* Concrete `torchdata.datasets` designed for file reading and other general tasks

# Example

- Create image reading dataset 

        import torchdata
        import torchvision


        class Images(torchdata.Dataset): # Different inheritance
             def __init__(self, path: str):
                super().__init__() # This is the only change
            self.files = [file for file in pathlib.Path(path).glob(""*"")]

        def __getitem__(self, index):
            return Image.open(self.files[index])

        def __len__(self):
            return len(self.files)

- `map` each element to `torch.Tensor` and `cache()` everything in memory:

        images = Images(""./data"").map(torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()).cache()

- concatenate with labels (another `torchdata.Dataset` instance) and iterate over:

        for data, label in images | labels:
            # Do whatever you want with your data

# Installation 

`pip` is the easiest of course:

        pip install torchdata

You can also use `nightly` releases (`torchdata-nightly`) or GPU/CPU Docker based images (check documentation). Hopefully `conda` will be released soon as well, stay tuned

BTW. You can also checkout [__torchfunc__](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchfunc), I plan to make a separate post about that in a week or so.

Thanks for reading and checking out the project",8,24

Let me be simple and clear: I have model created under keras, have setup the TF\_CONFIG to have a chief, a worker, a ps, and an evaluator server, and I assume that the below code should do the job:

    runConfig = tf.estimator.RunConfig(
    		session_config=config,
    		model_dir=log_dir,
    		save_summary_steps=1,
    		save_checkpoints_steps=train_steps
    		)
    estimator = tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(model, model_dir=log_dir, config=runConfig)
    train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(input_fn=lambda: read_datasets(...), max_steps=epochs*train_steps)
    eval_spec = tf.estimator.EvalSpec(input_fn=lambda: read_datasets(...), steps=None)
    tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator, train_spec, eval_spec)
    

And then I can see the performance graphs and values on Tensorboard. I assume that the code for all servers are exactly the same except the TF\_CONFIG part, and just one copy of training data is needed to be placed in a shared folder, and one shared directory is set to save model parameters and checkpoints, and the chief is going to synchronize everything on splitting the data between workers and saving the model and summaries. 

There is something here that I am not clear about it: I want to evaluate the trained model on a test data, and I assume that I can just execute the below command to get the evaluated loss and accuracy in a dictionary objecT:

    eval_dic = estimator.evaluate(input_fn=lambda: read_datasets(...), steps=test_steps)

But this code is run by all services (worker, chief, and evaluator), which I don't think should be. Also the result that I get is just null.

In addition, I see pages about distribution strategy and its implications on keras and estimators, which make me so much confused. Do I really need all of these strategy stuff, or just above code is sufficient? What about the input\_fn? I assumed that the chief is taking care of data split but in the tensorflow documentation ([https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distribute\_strategy](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distribute_strategy)) it says different things for keras and estimator implementation, and my application is a keras model encapsulated in an estimator!

Code is developed on Tensorflow/Keras and I am trying models with 3 to 7 layers, each having 16 to 64 LSTM cells. Due to huge data size (around 13.5M sample sequences), I am interested to do my model training in distributed mode by data parallelization over multiple GPUs or multiple PCs.  However, my tries by now have not resulted in any improvement over single system version and I am thinking if it is feasible at all or not.

My understanding from data parallelism under Tensorflow/Keras is that there are different workers, a chief, and a parameter server (ps). Model parameters are stored in ps and communicated with workers and chief, and each worker works on a partition of the whole data. Each worker should get the model parameters from ps at the start of each data batch processing, do all the forward and backward propagation and calculate the weight updates and send them back to ps, where the updated model parameters are calculated by chief and stored. Therefore, each worker should read the model parameters before each batch processing.

My simulation batch size is 1024, therefore there are about 13K batches in one epoch of data. Training of a model with 87,000 parameters took 412 seconds in my one-gpu system, which means about 30 ms per batch. A more complex model with 1M parameters took 1900 seconds to process one epoch, which means about 146 ms per batch.

Now that I look at the numbers, I am in doubt if data parallelism is helpful. If two GPUs or CPUs want to communicate 100K or 1M parameters, can it be so fast to be done in a few milliseconds to be negligible? My experiments on a two-GPU system (which doesn't require data transmission over network) resulted in batch processing time of twice single-GPU. Can it be attributed to the small batch processing time? If it is, does it mean that my model is not as complex as necessary for distribution?",0,0

**The goal**

I want to implement a custom loss in keras which is an integral on the outputs.Using the notations of keras, custom loss functions are of the form

    def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):

Where y\_true are the labels and y\_pred are the models' predictions. I also have the inputs X at hand (using a wrapper function around the custom\_loss). This input is of the same shape as the labels / predictions.Using these notations, the loss I wish to impose looks something along the lines of:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/n21u38cpnro31.png

Where f(x) is some function that's irrelevant to this discussion. Note that y\_true are irrelevant to the loss function (and that's ok. I have multiple loss functions, don't worry ;) )

Now x and y\_pred are simply arrays of 1XL for some length L.

For those familiar with scipy.integrate, this integral very easily calculated using the trapz function:

    trapz(y_pred*f(X), X)

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem /technical difficulty**

I'll describe the attempts I've made thus far, and the errors I faced in their implementation:

1. Used tensorflow.py\_function to wrap scipy.integrate.trapzThis returned an error where keras did not know how to calculate the derivative. I'm guessing keras precompiles derivative functions to use in the SGD optimizer?
2. Copied a function I found that implements trapz using keras / tf functions:

&amp;#x200B;

    def trapezoidal_integral_approx(t, y):
        return math_ops.reduce_sum(
                math_ops.multiply(t[1:] - t[:-1],
                                  (y[1:] + y[:-1]) / 2.), 
                name='trapezoidal_integral_approx')

This returned some weird error that I didn't understand:

&gt;tensorflow.python.framework.errors\_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Can not squeeze dim\[0\], expected a dimension of 1, got 1401  
&gt;  
&gt;\[\[{{node loss\_3/encoder\_output\_loss/weighted\_loss/Squeeze}}\]\]

&amp;#x200B;

3. Using tf.contrib.integrate.odeint: [https://www.tensorflow.org/api\_docs/python/tf/contrib/integrate/odeint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/integrate/odeint)This function just seems unintuitive and not suited for my needs (not trapz). I did not fully try to implement this method, and if someone suggests it, I can give it a try, but it does not accept two arrays as I need it to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottom line**

I'd appreciate help in my particular problem,  or a link to some code / example that attempts something similar (loss function that is comprised of an integral on y\_true or y\_pred or something along those lines).

Of late I have been trying various deep-learning models for Kaggle competitions. I primarily use PyTorch with Numpy,  Pandas and Scikit-learn for data-munging and building pipelines. The problem that I often run into during training is some syntactical / semantic mistake which, after rectification, requires restarting of the entire training scheme. As the training process is quite time-consuming, this further compounds the problem. I believe this wouldn't have happened in a compiled language e.g. C++ where these errors would have been caught during the compilation phase itself.

Personally, I have been a huge fan of python as a language, and have favored PyTorch over other deep-learning frameworks / libraries because I feel PyTorch is more 'pythonic'. However, for my current purposes, as the code volume increases, I feel increasing difficulty in avoiding the mistakes as I have mentioned above.

However, with compiled langues e.g. C++, I am not sure if there is adequate support for data pre-processing apart from that from various deep learning frameworks / libraries.

I welcome any suggestions in this regard, or any tips / tools in how to avoid them.",3,3

Encouraged by warm welcoming of my previous project last week ([torchdata](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchdata), thanks a lot) I'd like to share another PyTorch related project some of you might find helpful and interesting. [Here](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchfunc) is GitHub repository and [here](https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchfunc/) is documentation.

Also, if you have any suggestions/improvements/questions I will be glad to help.

Now, description (taken from project's readme with minor adjustments):

# What is it?

[**torchfunc**](https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchfunc/) is library revolving around [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) with a goal to help you with:


* Improving and analysing performance of your neural network (e.g. Tensor Cores compatibility)
* Record/analyse internal state of `torch.nn.Module` as data passes through it
* Do the above based on external conditions (using single `Callable` to specify it)
* Day-to-day neural network related duties (model size, seeding, performance measurements etc.)
* Get information about your host operating system, CUDA devices and others

# Quick examples

### Get instant performance tips about your module. All problems described by comments will be shown by `torchfunc.performance.tips`:

    class Model(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.convolution = torch.nn.Sequential(
                torch.nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3),
                torch.nn.ReLU(inplace=True),  # Inplace may harm kernel fusion
                torch.nn.Conv2d(32, 128, 3, groups=32),  # Depthwise is slower in PyTorch
                torch.nn.ReLU(inplace=True),  # Same as before
                torch.nn.Conv2d(128, 250, 3),  # Wrong output size for TensorCores
            )

            self.classifier = torch.nn.Sequential(
                torch.nn.Linear(250, 64),  # Wrong input size for TensorCores
                torch.nn.ReLU(),  # Fine, no info about this layer
                torch.nn.Linear(64, 10),  # Wrong output size for TensorCores
            )

        def forward(self, inputs):
            convolved = torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)(self.convolution(inputs)).flatten()
            return self.classifier(convolved)

    # All you have to do
    print(torchfunc.performance.tips(Model()))

### Seed globaly (including `numpy` and `cuda`), freeze weights, check inference time and model size:

    # Inb4 MNIST, you can use any module with those functions
    model = torch.nn.Linear(784, 10)
    torchfunc.seed(0)
    frozen = torchfunc.module.freeze(model, bias=False)

    with torchfunc.Timer() as timer:
      frozen(torch.randn(32, 784)
      print(timer.checkpoint()) # Time since the beginning
      frozen(torch.randn(128, 784)
      print(timer.checkpoint()) # Since last checkpoint
      
    print(f""Overall time {timer}; Model size: {torchfunc.sizeof(frozen)}"")


### Record and sum per-layer and per-neuron activation statistics as data passes through network:

    # Still MNIST but any module can be put in it's place
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(
        torch.nn.Linear(784, 100),
        torch.nn.ReLU(),
        torch.nn.Linear(100, 50),
        torch.nn.ReLU(),
        torch.nn.Linear(50, 10),
    )
    # Recorder which sums all inputs to layers
    recorder = torchfunc.hooks.recorders.ForwardPre(reduction=lambda x, y: x+y)
    # Record only for torch.nn.Linear
    recorder.children(model, types=(torch.nn.Linear,))
    # Train your network normally (or pass data through it)
    ...
    # Activations of all neurons of first layer! 
    print(recorder[1]) # You can also post-process this data easily with apply

# Installation

## [pip](&lt;https://pypi.org/project/torchfunc/&gt;)

### Latest release:

```
pip install --user torchfunc
```

### Nightly:

```
pip install --user torchfunc-nightly
```

### One could also check the project out with Docker, see more info in README as this post is getting long I guess",0,7

We expect that the hypergradient based learning rate update could be more accurate and aim to exploit the gains much better by boosting the learning rate updates with momentum and adaptive gradients, experimenting with

1. Hypergradient descent with momentum, and
2. Adam with Hypergradient,

alongside the model optimizers SGD, SGD with Nesterov(SGDN) and Adam.

The new optimizers are compared with their resepective hypergradient-descent baselines and provide advantages such as better generalization and faster convergence for the loss function. The code and the results of our experiments are available at [https://github.com/harshalmittal4/Hypergradient\_variants](https://github.com/harshalmittal4/Hypergradient_variants).",0,3

I think for most people it's much effort to get them running (installing libraries or even understand tensorflow). **I thought about spinning up a more low-level API hub.** So not wondering if you need python 2 or 3, or downloading Gigabytes of models on your harddrive.

To make an example, e.g., I want to make a cool video I could use a GAN to create images and then use another GAN to apply a style to them, and maybe a third AI to morph between the images to create video frames. The basic concept is something like Zapier for machine learning.

1st) If anybody is interested, reply, or PM me. I'm looking for useful models which can be ""apified"" or people who are struggling in using existing models and who would like to try it out. If you want to earn something on your model that could be achieved with API-rates but I intend to keep al APIs free for personal/non-commercial use.

2nd) I'm myself very new to ML, so I'm wondering how doable this is. E.g., models expect input shapes, I mean most of the work is preparing the dataset, but this is still something the user might be capable of doing on his own.

3rd) I'm grateful for any great models which exist out there. I found some here: [https://github.com/tensorflow/models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) and on the hub [https://www.tensorflow.org/hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) and these (more general ones): [https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models](https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models)",0,0
