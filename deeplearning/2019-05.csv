I recently came across how CNNs have been used recently for image segmentation

I'm currently working on a project in which I have a set of very noisy images (around 50 images total) and I want to locate the objects in the image and separate them from the noise/background. So far, I've only used classical image denoising and edge detection methods. It has been difficult to implement this because the images are very noisy and while the larger objects are difficult to detect, there are some small, faint objects that are very difficult to detect unless I use very specific parameters in the classical computer vision methods that I use

If I understand this correctly, I could use CNNs for this problem by augmenting my original set of images (by applying rotations, transformations, etc?) to get a larger training size that is necessary for CNNs, right? Or could I use transfer learning? The images I'm dealing with are proprietary so I can't discuss them in detail here. But the objects in them are not people, dogs, cats, airplanes, or other common objects in the CNN examples I've read about. Also, because I want to detect the objects with better accuracy than just a bounding box, semantic segmentation is what I should look into for this project, right?

I just recently came across GANs, DL Semantic Segmentation (UNets, Mask RCNNs, DeepLab, etc), etc. Which of these should I start with assuming I have only basic knowledge of CNNs and Deep Learning?",6,10

Hey there

I'm working my way into the chatbot topic right now. I already did some projects with rasa nlu and chatterbot.

Now I want to take the next step and want to create one with word2vec or seq2vec. Building my own corpus and train it with either a Reddit or Wikipedia corpus.

Unfortunately, I don't find good readings, tutorials on the internet. My goal is to create my own corpus (FAQ corpus and General information about my university).

Does anyone have some good readings on this topic? And more important, what's the best way to built the corpus?

\- Can I simply put all my answers in a csv?

\- do I need to do question (column A) - answer (column B) in the csv

\- can I put all the information as continuous text in a text file?

\- Is is better to do it the same way as with rasa nlu? with integer and then possible answers?

Thanks a lot for all your answers

At a loss regarding AMD VS Intel CPUs,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/bk9swp/building_first_pc_for_deep_learning_at_a_loss/,Atralb,1556897576,"Hi, so I'm building a DL rig for \~2k. I was a complete hardware virgin 3 weeks ago. Since then I read A LOT. Anything I can find on the internet, articles, Reddit (any related subs \^\^), pcpartpicker, specifications and manuals of dozens of Mobos and cpus. I read all I could find on PCIe lanes, CPU usage in DL, storage needs, ram needs, etc....  


I saw a lot of people recommending to have x16 PCIe lanes per GPU and I saw all the benchmarks I could find on this ([Tim Detters](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/), [Puget Systems (gaming perfs)](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Impact-of-PCI-E-Speed-on-Gaming-Performance-518/), people on reddit) which tell about 5-10% difference in perfs on average.  


Since I want to be able to at least run 2 GPUs at full working load, and a lot of people recommend the Threadripper for its 64 PCIe lanes (e.g. [Jeff Chen](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-build-the-perfect-deep-learning-computer-and-save-thousands-of-dollars-9ec3b2eb4ce2)) I thought it was a good idea even if I only want 2 (which would be 2x16+4 for NVMe SSD = 36 PCIe lanes) cause Ryzen CPUs only got 24 lanes usable and Intel CPU with more than 16 PCIe lanes are far more expensive afaik except for old generations ones (but I'll be glad to be proven wrong on that, I don't know much about intel cpus since there so many...).  


However I just saw this post yesterday on r/nvidia : [deep\_learning\_2080ti\_slower\_than\_2080](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/bccbsz/deep_learning_2080ti_slower_than_2080/) where a guy has two rigs, one with 2080 and i7 8700 and on the other 2080Ti with Threadripper 1920X. And people were saying that performance was better in the first rig cause ""8700 is significantly faster in single thread, and most gpu acceleration is single thread"".   


So now I'm completely lost as to if my choice of Threadripper is maybe actually overkill if I can only afford 2 GPUs and maybe an Intel even with 8x PCIe on each would give better performances. Can you help me ? And if you go for Intel could you give me some insight among the legion of CPUs they offer.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf)

Abstract:

Recent  methods generalize convolutional layers from Euclidean domains to   graph-structured data by approximating the eigenbasis of the graph   Laplacian. The computationally-efficient and broadly-used Graph ConvNet   of Kipf &amp; Welling, over-simplifies the approximation, effectively   rendering graph convolution as a neighborhood-averaging operator. This   simplification restricts the model from learning delta operators, the   very premise of the graph Laplacian.  In this work, we propose a new   Graph Convolutional layer which mixes multiple powers of the adjacency   matrix, allowing it to learn delta operators. Our layer exhibits the   same memory footprint and computational complexity as a GCN. We   illustrate the strength of our proposed layer on both synthetic graph   datasets, and on several real-world citation graphs, setting the record   state-of-the-art on Pubmed.",0,1

We are highly focused and streamlined, yet loose and flexible (effortless effort being the motto). Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can propel us to 5th dimension and beyond while still connected to Earth but ultimately undergoing physical transfiguration, also fueled by the bowels of the earth likewise (as above so below)- which constructs a beastly cyclotron that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.

&amp;#x200B;

""As soon as humanity unites on this planet, it will qualify to establish contact with other more advanced civilizations, such as the Agarthans and those from the GF. In fact the Agarthans and some ascended masters such as St. Germain will already help us run the cities of light and the numerous healing centres which will manifest very soon all over the globe. The next step will be visiting other civilizations, but this could only happen after the incarnated human personality has completed the LBP and has ascended at least to 5D by transfiguring from a carbon-based body into crystalline light body.""

The three cities of light will be open portals to the multiverse and to numerous advanced humanoid, and later on, other civilisations, such as the dragons. Alone this fact will make the existence of national states and nations obsolete as all the people will recognize their multidimensional nature and will strive to ascend too and be able to live in these cities of light and enjoy the advantages of a higher dimensional life. In the first place, they will enjoy the healing possibilities there which will help all humans advance rapidly in their LBP and also ascend.

""You see, nothing is ever just about one thing. We are not just sharing information with you. We are also preparing you for contact. Now, all of the other beings from the other star systems that are connecting with you all through the various channels that you have there on Earth are doing the same thing. And certainly those who channel faeries are readying you for more interactions with the fae.""

""We are excited to witness the coming together of humanity and the Arcturian beings that you will be meeting in the flesh. Now, of course, some have already established connections with physical Arcturian beings.  A full and open contact with the fourth and fifth dimensional beings who are from our little star system.""

I am interested in building a desktop to conduct Deep Learning over multiple GPUs. 

Some background: I currently use Keras with a TensorFlow backend and emphasize convolutional neural networks. I know that PyTorch uses MKL for numpy acceleration, so Intel CPUs are sometimes preferred  for that reason when using PyTorch. Because I am using TensorFlow, I am leaning toward AMD's threadripper line due to high thread count and number of PCIe lanes. 

I have a tentative parts list created, but wanted to get your thoughts:
[Part list (Final Build will have 2 additional GPUs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/nKKG9J)

Here are the main points, and my reasoning. Please let me know if there are any choices you support, and please correct me if I misunderstand pros/cons, or you have a strong preference on an aspect. I just here to try to learn from your experience.

* Processor: [AMD - Threadripper 2990WX 3 GHz 32-Core Processor](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_threadripper/2990wx) (Offers 60 PCIe lanes, Enough for 4 GPUs at 8x and for PCIe Storage; Emphasis on high thread count for better parallel CPU-based preprocessing, despite worse single thread performance compared to i9s)
* [Motherboard: ASRock - X399 Taichi ATX](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X399%20Taichi/index.asp): PCIe slot spacing should allow for 4 dual slot cards with support for up to 128 GB of RAM (8 slots). Also has 3 M.2 slots
* GPUs: [4 EVGA 1080tis](https://www.evga.com/products/specs/gpu.aspx?pn=1190fbf7-7f11-465d-b303-cab0e50fbdc6) (I hear that blower style is preferred for multi GPU systems, but I also hear that large cases can mitigate the issue with non-blower cards)
* Memory: G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3000 Memory (32 GB to start, but can increase the amount up to 128GB
* Storage: Samsung - 970 Evo 1 TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive (For the primary drive. M.2 for increased speeds vs. SATA)
* Secondary Storage: Seagate  4 TB 3.5"" 5400RPM Internal Hard Drive (For additional space to keep data when not being trained
* Power Supply: [EVGA - SuperNOVA G2 1600 W](https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=120-G2-1600-X1) (4 1080ti max power = 1000W + AMD threadripper at 250W)
* Cooling: [Noctua CPU Cooler](https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12s-tr4-sp3)

Are these reasonable specifications?",11,11

I want to get involved with whichever task of classification (sentiment analysis, hate speech, etc.) regarding text data, by using deep learning for my bachelor thesis.

I am confused about what should be the aim of the dissertation. I mean, I am not capable to come with something ground breaking or fancy (eg. A new complicated architecture). Beyond building some architectures from papers and testing data on them, what can I do in order to make the thesis more interesting?

Something I have thought of, is to create a pipeline that will retrieve tweets from the Twitter API from different locations and then pass them to a trained model in order to perform some kind of classification and then create a visualization of the world map regarding the topic (eg. brexit-preferences of each country). However, this doesn't make a lot of sense since that procedure could be done more naively by counting specific hashtags on a geographical location. Also, how the dataset could be created and labeled?

Can you help me reconstruct my idea or guide me to a better direction?",6,5

Abstract:  We propose a new paradigm of the detection task that is anchor-box free and NMS free. Although the current state-of-the-art model that based on region proposed method has been well-acknowledged for years, however as the basis of RPN, NMS cannot solve the problem of low recall in complicated occlusion situation. This situation is particularly critical when it faces up to complex occlusion. We proposed to use weak-supervised segmentation multimodal annotations to achieve a highly robust object detection performance without NMS. In such cases, we utilize poor annotated Bounding Box annotations to perform a robust object detection performance in the difficult circumstance. We have avoided all hyperparameters related to anchor boxes and NMS. Our proposed model has outperformed previous anchor-based one-stage and multi-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler. We have reached a state-of-the-art performance in both accuracies, recall rate",0,5

Hey guys!

How to play the piano for kids by PianoCourse101 is based on the Bastien Piano Basic Series for children. The Bastien Piano Basic Series consists of four levels. There are the ""Primer Level"", ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" and ""Level 3"". I will eventually be uploading all of the courses on youtube. The first few lessons of the ""Primer Level"" are free and available on youtube while the rest of the lessons will be available on my website, which will be announced pretty soon. Lesson 1, Lesson 2 and Lesson 3 are paid courses. I believe that PianoCourse101 offers piano lessons that is not only well structured by engaging for children. Utilising a white board with rhythm exercises, explaining terms in a visually presentable manner is one unique method in making learning fun for kids.

Researchers have developed an efficient strategy for accelerating adversarial training for neural networks. We recast the adversarial training for neural networks as a differential game and derive a Pontryagins Maximal Principle for it. Based on the maximal principle, we discover that the adversary is only coupled with the weights of the first layer. This helps us to split the adversary updating from the backpropagation gradient calculation.

What I have so far is a two-output autoencoder, with one end being standard reconstruction, the other being a cluster prediction vector. The loss function combines reconstruction loss, KL divergence between the prediction distribution and a student-T distribution, and a mean squared error between total predictions and a uniform distribution. 

The above problem doesn't seem awful to solve, but I do have one more constraint that I can't figure out how to build into the network. I have connectivity constraints on my data as it's originally from a graph, so I can only have two points in the same cluster if a path exists between them in the underlying graph. I've seen there's a lot of research on must-link and cannot-link constraints but that's not quite what I need.

Abstract:  Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention in machine learning, but the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. We demonstrate that adversarial examples can be directly attributed to the presence of non-robust features: features derived from patterns in the data distribution that are highly predictive, yet brittle and incomprehensible to humans. After capturing these features within a theoretical framework, we establish their widespread existence in standard datasets. Finally, we present a simple setting where we can rigorously tie the phenomena we observe in practice to a misalignment between the (human-specified) notion of robustness and the inherent geometry of the data.",0,1

They are way too big to combine since I run out of RAM even trying to merge them. I managed combine 10 of them but my RAM runs out when I load it so they cannot be merged.

I would like to train my CNN on 2-20 and then test it with 1. However my approach seems to reset the net each time I use a new set.

I pasted the output here: https://justpaste.it/28tk0

But to summarize, even after 9 hours of training, the test set is still at between 10% and 20% accuracy (btw there are 23 classes in total). The problem is it doesn't improve at all. However the most important part is, for some reason, after file 14, the test accuracy is always around 40%. For file 3, it's literally always as 13%.

From these results I conclude that I have failed to train the CNN on multiple sets and instead it always resets when I use a new set.

**Abstract:** Semi-supervised learning has proven to be a powerful paradigm for leveraging unlabeled data to mitigate the reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we unify the current dominant approaches for semi-supervised learning to produce a new algorithm, MixMatch, that works by guessing low-entropy labels for data-augmented unlabeled examples and mixing labeled and unlabeled data using MixUp. We show that MixMatch obtains state-of-the-art results by a large margin across many datasets and labeled data amounts. For example, on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels, we reduce error rate by a factor of 4 (from 38% to 11%) and by a factor of 2 on STL-10. We also demonstrate how MixMatch can help achieve a dramatically better accuracy-privacy trade-off for differential privacy. Finally, we perform an ablation study to tease apart which components of MixMatch are most important for its success.",0,5

1. Augmented vision that draws boxes, labels around the object recognised- also easier for general public to understand and on display on the box.
2. Visualizer that has vector representation which sums up input from all sensors and has no pictures- basically shows the car's view of the world in vector space.

Is Tesla cars doing something completely different (like summing vector representation from all sensors should match for car navigation) than only road segmentation, lane detection, vehicle detection, object detection etc for car navigation.

**Abstract:**  Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In computer vision, well-crafted perturbations to images can cause neural networks to make mistakes such as confusing a cat with a computer. Previous adversarial attacks have been designed to degrade performance of models or cause machine learning models to produce specific outputs chosen ahead of time by the attacker. We introduce attacks that instead reprogram the target model to perform a task chosen by the attackerwithout the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack finds a single adversarial perturbation, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversaryeven if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can thus be considered a program for the new task. We demonstrate adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing these models to perform a counting task, as well as classification tasks: classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented as inputs to the ImageNet model.",2,7

I understand how text generation works but I was wondering if there is a way to train a model that can generate text based on our desires. For example, I have some context and I would like it to generate more poetic , more philosophical or let's say a mix between the two of them with more accent on philosophy.

I am not sure how that would be achieved. I know that OpenAI GPT of BERT can generate quite good texts but I am not sure even with fine-tuning on those topic if there is a way to achieve that.

Maybe a way to do that is with adjusting the temperature of the LSTM but I am not really sure.

In YOLO, there is a loss about 'there is object in predicted bbox' as confidence score

Well, PyTorch is a joy to work with! It is easy to learn and experiment with, often faster than Tensorflow and as far as popularity is concerned, Google trends show it is gaining momentum.

In our latest article, we describe how to do image classification in PyTorch using transfer learning.  
This post serves as an initial post to a series of upcoming posts, where we apply transfer learning to classify images in different domains such as medical images, art images etc.

Abstract:  This paper describes the exploration and learnings during the process of developing a self-driving algorithm in simulation, followed by deployment on a real car. We specifically concentrate on the Formula Student Driverless competition. In such competitions, a formula race car, designed and built by students, is challenged to drive through previously unseen tracks that are marked by traffic cones. We explore and highlight the challenges associated with training a deep neural network that uses a single camera as input for inferring car steering angles in real-time. The paper explores in-depth creation of simulation, usage of simulations to train and validate the software stack and then finally the engineering challenges associated with the deployment of the system in real-world.",0,4

I'm second year student (double major in computer science and pure math). I've been on the internship in Microsoft last year (worked on HoloLens) and I'll be doing it again this summer. I'm primarily interested in machine learning and computer vision in general, but I'd like to be very precise with these terms. I'm not planning to pursue any kind of research or academia positions, but software engineering role. CV would be field of interest, but from engineering point of view. Since I have strong mathematical background and solid development skills my ultimate goal would be to combine those two ""with ML on top of it"".

My question is: is it actually possible and reasonable to pursue such a career?",1,5

**Abstract:**  Several recent works have shown how highly realistic human head images can be obtained by training convolutional neural networks to generate them. In order to create a personalized talking head model, these works require training on a large dataset of images of a single person. However, in many practical scenarios, such personalized talking head models need to be learned from a few image views of a person, potentially even a single image. Here, we present a system with such few-shot capability. It performs lengthy meta-learning on a large dataset of videos, and after that is able to frame few- and one-shot learning of neural talking head models of previously unseen people as adversarial training problems with high capacity generators and discriminators. Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that training can be based on just a few images and done quickly, despite the need to tune tens of millions of parameters. We show that such an approach is able to learn highly realistic and personalized talking head models of new people and even portrait paintings",1,12

Inside of each split it  has another split: train/test or train/val/test.

The way to work with those datasets is to train on split-1 and test on split-1?
the train on split-2 and test on split-2...?
so on..

 Any experience with those datasets for someone?

Abstract:  Point cloud data from 3D LiDAR sensors are one of the most crucial sensor modalities for versatile safety-critical applications such as self-driving vehicles. Since the annotations of point cloud data is an expensive and time-consuming process, therefore recently the utilization of simulated environments and 3D LiDAR sensors for this task started to get some popularity. With simulated sensors and environments, the process for obtaining an annotated synthetic point cloud data became much easier. However, the generated synthetic point cloud data are still missing the artifacts usually exist in point cloud data from real 3D LiDAR sensors. As a result, the performance of the trained models on this data for perception tasks when tested on real point cloud data is degraded due to the domain shift between simulated and real environments. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a domain adaptation framework for bridging this gap between synthetic and real point cloud data. Our proposed framework is based on the deep cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) architecture. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed framework on the task of vehicle detection from a birds eye view (BEV) point cloud images coming from real 3D LiDAR sensors. The framework has shown competitive results with an improvement of more than 7% in average precision score over other baseline approaches when tested on real BEV point cloud images.",0,1
