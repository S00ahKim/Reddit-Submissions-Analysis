I thought one would just have to feed them the audiobooks and the equivalent text files, to teach the algorhythm how words sound. There is literally 10s of thousands of hours of perfectly intonated and pronounced audio material and each of those is perfectly written down.
Anybody got some intel on that thought?",2,2
