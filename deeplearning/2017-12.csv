Conv1D: (batch, length, channels)
LSTM: (batch, timeSteps, features)

The output of the Conv1D is = (length - (kernel_size - 1)/strides), and therefore doesn't match the LSTM shape anymore, even without using MaxPooling1D and Dropout.

To be more specific, my training set X has n samples with 1000 time steps and one channel (n_samples, 1000, 1), and I used LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder so y has n samples, 1000 time steps and 5 one hot encoded classes (n_samples, 1000, 5).Since one class is much more prevalent than the others (is actually the absence of signal), I am using loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', sample_weight_mode=""temporal"" and sample_weight to give a higher weight to time steps containing meaningful classes.
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv1D(128, 3, strides=1, input_shape = (1000, 1), activation = 'relu'))
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)))
    model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(5, activation='softmax')))
    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['categorical_accuracy'], sample_weight_mode=""temporal"")
    print(model.summary())
When I try to fit the model I get this error message: 
**Error when checking target: expected time_distributed_1 to have shape (None, 998, 1) but got array with shape (100, 1000, 5).**

 Is there ant way to make such neural net work?",2,1

&amp;nbsp;

His example is a linear regression problem but let's say I have a classification problem and I give a NN algorithm images of some sceneries. Will the hidden layers represent the types of objects in that image (e.g. tree, rock, sky) or is it just something visually meaningless?

I want to focus my area of research on computer vision and deep learning. 

There is so much hue and cry as to which framework is the winner. I want to ask a simple question. 

Which should I go with? PyTorch or Tensorflow? 

PyTorch seems more python like. But tensorflow has huge community and lota and lots of tutorials. Mkrwover whenever any new paper comes out, the tensorflow community is fast enough to produce multiple implementations of the paper. Whereas in PyTorch a handful of them comes out that too a bit later. 

I am confused which to invest my time on.

""Another perspective on deep learning is that depthenables the computer to learn a multistep computer program. Each layer of the representation can be thought of as the state of the computers memory after executing another set of instructions in parallel. Networks with greater depth can execute more instructions in sequence. Sequential instructions oer great power because later instructions can refer back to the results of earlier instructions. According to this view of deep learning, **not all the information in a layers activations** necessarily encodes factors of variation that explain the input.""

It is unclear to me how the link between the first convolutional layer (ReLU Conv1) and the primary capsules layer (PrimaryCaps) is designed. In implementations I have come across on the web, it seems that we apply convolution again to ReLU Conv1, get 256 feature maps and then resize them to 32 vector maps. So, we would employ convolution to get PrimaryCaps. This seems to contradict information given in the paper [Section 4]:

""Each primary capsule output sees the outputs of all 256  81 Conv1 units whose receptive fields overlap with the location of the center of the capsule.""

The paper suggests that either 1) each element of each local capsule vector is fully-connected to each local unit in ReLU Conv1 or 2) the first element of a capsule vector is connected to units 1:32 of ReLU Conv1, the second element of the capsule is connected to untis 33:64 and so on. It is unclear to me which is the case. In particular, option 1) looks very much like a fully-connected layer.

So which one is it? 1)? 2)? Or am I missing something and the implementation I described earlier is correct? I would appreciate any comments.",2,1

1. In my keras learning, when I used cross-entropy loss function, loss became negative (I suspect it is due to overflow since it cannot be negative mathematically, although I did not check thoroughly). But when I changed loss function to KL divergence, this no longer happened.

2. Intuitively, it divides and subtracts, so less likely to overflow.

Is there any paper on this? I could not find any.

as an update equation for mathematical optimization. It was the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of an equation. I thought this method mostly applies for minimization in machine learning as cost is always defined as a positive real valued function. But it was pointed out to me that the update equation of newton-raphson method, which is x = x - y / dy_dx, is unstable at local minimas (where dy_dx = 0) since it makes the update burst to infinity.

I kept playing with this equation more since it gave me the smoothest curve for what I had been trying to do -&gt; https://github.com/akanimax/my-deity/blob/master/Scripts/IDEA_2/RANIK%20optimizer.ipynb and, I was firm on the idea that the update equation must include the cost term (the Einstein's space-time analogy: The dimension of cost is connected with all the parameter dimensions).

Eventually, I landed on this update equation, x = x - ((y * dy_dx) / (y + dy_dx2)); dy_dx = derivative of y wrt. x link to code -&gt; https://github.com/akanimax/my-deity/blob/master/Scripts/IDEA_2/RANIK%20optimizer%202.0.ipynb found in last section: ""Equation 2: modified from newton-raphson method"".

To relate this update equation with the title: if we consider the update portion of the equation -&gt; g(x, y) = (y * x) / (y + x2) ; y &gt;= 0 It is quite similar to adam since there is a square gradient term in the denominator and the gradient term in the numerator. This equation doesn't use momentum (running averages) and, the learning_rate is replaced by cost (y).

Now, in Adam, the alpha is initially manually set and is utilised as per the decay equation -&gt; lr_t &lt;- learning_rate * sqrt(1 - beta2t) / (1 - beta1t). WIth the equation that I have mentioned, the hypothesis is that this decay is kind of estimating the cost term itself.

Link to the 3d curve of the g(x, y) function -&gt; https://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/?expression=(x*y)%2F(x%2B(y*y))&amp;xRange=0%2C+200&amp;yRange=-100%2C+100&amp;resolution=25

Please let me know what you think about this hypothesis and what it's implications are. I would be thankful and highly grateful if you could point me to some more relevant research so that I can move forward with this. Thank you!",0,1

Weather systems are chaotic an are not deterministic so would a neural net work with any success?
What if I gave it a range of temperature and humidity to predict to , instead of a single absolute value would the success rate be higher in making feasible weather predictions?",11,1

Nvidia donated two Titan XP. Therefore, I am trying to get everything to assemble the computer. Our budget is a bit flexible, ~3K. This computer is going to be used mainly for process 3D medical image analysis (CT, MRI), we prefer it to be stable. We will use windows for this computer. For deep learning, we are going to use either tenserflow or Matlab. 

After reading many posts, I have generated a list: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/jBBqYr

We do have several must have preferences:
1. since we already have two Titan XP, we need to house both of them
2. This is mainly for research, we will not overclock. Also we prefer Intel core
3. Currently, we will use 2-way SLI, and prefer to have potentials to extend to 4-way SLI

We will need your advice on
1. since we have two titan xp, do we need to build other cooling system other than the CPU cooling?
2. is there anything we need to tweak to avoid any bottleneck in the computer
3. if we purchase everything online, how hard will it be to build from scratch by ourselves? I knew the local Fry's store can do it for us, but not quite sure if they will have every hardware we want. Since we are not expert, we hate to bring the final list to store and then switch things here and there.

Thank you in advance for any helpful comments.

As far as I've seen, it can mean 2 things:

- 5 models were trained, then predicted the probabilities for each example in the test set and they were summed together. Accuracy was calculated for this final sum.

- 5 models were trained. Accuracy was calculated for each one. The median of that results was calculated after that.

If the first one is the correct, then how is the standard deviation calculated?

Which of this option is the correct?",1,1
