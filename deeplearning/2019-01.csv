Johnson got the image outputs three times faster than Gatys. So of course the paper said the group used a residual network (versus Gatys who used a VGG?), stochastic gradient descent, and it appears like Johnson et al also back-prop after the forward pass, unlike Gatys. But there is one part of the paper that I didn't understand: 

&gt;   The key insight of these methods is that convolutional neural networks pretrained for image classification have already learned to encode the perceptual and semantic information we would like to measure in our loss functions. We therefore make use of a network  pretrained for image classification as a fixed loss network in order to define our loss functions. Our deep convolutional transformation network is thus trained using loss functions that are also deep convolutional networks. 

Does the CNN that is pre-trained trained on the style picture provided? What does fixed mean, like loss that is cached somewhere that will always be the same for all pictures?

I'm tinkering on a project to measure the speed of either fishes or insects filmed from above. Perhaps I'm just a noob, but how do I create my training-data automatically and efficient? The camera delivers a h.264 stream, I dumped it with youtub-dl and used ffmpeg to convert it to single JPEG-frames at 1280x720 pixels. 

&amp;#x200B;

In all the tutorials for object detection and NeuralNetworking I read about small (like 10x10 pixel?) images as datasets. But eg. the fishes are barely 10x10pixel in size one those frames. Best I can do is like 50x50 without scaling.

And of course, I need to train with a dataset of images showing fishes, and a dataset of the same size showing empty water... right? I wonder if there is a way to do this faster than just cropping images by hand? I already feel exhausted after like 50 frames...! XD",3,1

However, something I've never found out how to do is keep progress, integrate into a game or website, and running it. Let me explain in short and long.

TL;DR:  
How do I save progress after training?  
How do I integrate into a UE4 game or a website?  
How do I prepare the code for testing, when there's training code in there?

Longer version:  
After making a new network, I run it with the training data. Great! So now, the weights have updated permanently, right? WRONG! If I run it again, I get pretty much the exact same results, 0 improvement. So here's the first problem: how do I keep my progress after training? So, let's say I've saved progress, my network has improved! Now, let's deploy it to one of my games. But... how? How do I put Python code into, say, C++ code for a UE4 game, and how do I integrate it into say a bot. My CNN/Q-Learning hybrid trains on visuals from other games to predict the best next move. But if I were to somehow insert it into my code and run it, it still has the training code with the training datasets. Do I have to redo the code for testing? Wouldn't that again lose all my progress? My current QLCNN is made for a person to monitor it, since it outputs loss and charts and other sorts of data. Is the main code similar to a header file in C++ or Java where I have to make another file that actually runs it? 

Thanks a lot! Sorry these questions, especially the first, seem stupid, but I've watched billions of videos and lectures and never have had someone explain DL after training.",2,1

I apologize if this post is inappropriate but I'm hoping it's within sub rules.

We are starting a tech company in the Northern California region and are searching for a possible CTO/cofounder.

What we are trying to do is to bring a smart management system for retail businesses. Our system will ""replace"" (or augment) owners/managers by creating smart and dynamic task lists for employees. The task lists are generated using ML vision processing algorithm (i.e. that detects there's a spill or a misplaced item) and IOT sensors that are linked up to provide data such as when an item goes out of stock. When retail businesses are run efficiently and effectively by owners/managers  through clear and concse direction for hourly front end employees on what to do on an ongoing basis the businesses are much more profitable. And we are simply trying to duplicate this increase to their bottom line using our software.

If what I wrote above sounds intimidating then don't be alarmed. What we are trying to do doesn't require that deep of a DL/ML knowledge. In fact someone who has done the Coursera ML class from Stanford and who can code very likely is qualified enough.

So in summary, bounding boxes proposed my MultiboxPrior function of  Gloun would generate bounding boxes that mimics a line (horizontal  rectangle). This rectangle would have size as described above.

But when I train the network and use MultiboxTarget function and  visualize the bounding boxes, I do not get any bounding boxes that are  or horizontal orientation or square. I get all bounding boxes that are  of vertical orientation.

So the question is how is this possible. Because my anchor size and  ratio allows for bounding box to be either horizontal rectangle or a  perfect square. Am I missing something? Does SSD work differently?",0,1

I've been playing around with LSTM to understand how they work. I've a basic question regarding the inputs. So, can we use the features as well as ALL labels from the past to predict the label today?

For example -- Suppose I have the daily Open, High, Low, Close for an oil company and the oil Price. I collect the data for first 7 days. Now standing at the 7th day, there are two possibilities for the features -- 

1) I can either use the Open, High, Low, Close data for all 7 days to predict the oil price on day 7

2) Shift all the oil prices down (shift all the labels down -- oil price for day 1 goes to day 2). So, for day 7, use day2-day7 O,H,L,C and all the lagged oil prices (day2 - day7).

Which one seems correct? I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question. This is my first experience with LSTM. Really appreciate any help.",3,1

My data has 2 features - a previous score and a previous choice. At training ,each cell should get the Xt (which , as said - has 2 features) and predict y\_hat and at the end of the sequence I expect the loss to be the categorical loss between the y\_hats and y\_truths .

Thing is , I want the test to be as follows : option 1: the t th cell should get the previous score (Xt's first feature) and the previous choice(Xt's second feature) - and this t cell should produce y\_hat that will be given to t+1 cell , along with Xt+1 first feature (meaning that the previous choice is now yt\_hat).

option 2: same as 1, only with outputting prediction only at the end of the sequence.

Can it even be done in keras , or should I go to a more low-level approach such as tensorflow ?",0,1

That made me wonder if the conv layers on NN's also used separable convolutions. I didn't find as much info as I was thinking I'd get, but it seemed there's a different type of layer (SeparableConv2D) that does use separable convolutions, whilst the Conv2D doesn't. I also heard it's not ideal to use SeparableConv2D early in the models.

&amp;#x200B;

If both product of matrices produce the same result and separable is so much faster than a normal convolution window, why does conv2D not use this technique? Why is it dangerous?

* What is the proper name for this type of technique? It's not quite the same as neural style transfer so maybe it's called something specific?
* If anyone could recommend any reading material/tutorials etc that would be great
* Compared to building a smile detector from scratch (assuming I'm using an existing face detector), how much harder is this?

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the flavors create a latent mean &amp; deviation, then sample from that distribution using noise to build the final latent representation. So, my guess is that you use the latent parametrization instead of the final representation, unless you deliberately want noisy features.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone with expertise comment or point me towards any good paper discussing this?",2,1

My NumPy implementation is 100% deterministic in that I get the EXACT same output every time I run my code -- nothing is random.

My Keras implementation is also deterministic. I'd like to get the EXACT same output as my NumPy implementation using my Keras implementation -- I am mainly trying to get the learned weights to be the same, but also the loss during training. Currently, my Keras implementation's loss starts out lower and ends up lower than my NumPy implementations.

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got an Applied Scientist offer in computer vision from a FAANG company. Currently I've been working as a software development engineer (mostly infrastructure, can get boring) in the same company for around 6 months. I have a master's degree in CS (no publications) and am interested in the applied science work but have a few concerns regarding future growth. Since the field is mostly populated by PhDs, would my career growth be impacted as I'll be competing with other PhDs. Also, will it be hard to find jobs in other companies later? I've been looking at the job postings and most companies require a PhD or top tier conference papers and I have none of these. In terms of long term vision, I am interested in going towards the management track(Planning to move in 6-7 years). Would the lack of a PhD/papers be a hindrance in this? My interests lie in computer vision and deep learning probably because of their heavy linear algebra dependence but not in the traditional ML side of things which depend heavily on statistics and probability.  I have to spend a lot of time understanding them. I have concerns because computer vision is a very niche field and I do not want to be in a position where I have to take a step back in the later stages of my career. I would really appreciate any advice on this. Also, it'd be great if anyone can shed light on  how much you have to study in your personal time to keep yourself updated with the ongoing research.

1) Why do we need to use a sequence of 20 per sample? Why cant it just be kept as data from 10 sensors at each time stamp (2D format)? This 3 dimensional format makes it much harder to work with the data.

2) I was told that to predict x seconds in the future you need to be able to see x seconds into the past and thats why the data is formatted into sequences of 20 (they correspond to 2 seconds of data). Why is this rule true? And why cant we just use normal 2D data without any sequences and then have the network learn patterns so it can predict 2 seconds into the future?",5,1

I'm training on a dataset that allows me to generate new data every iteration. I take advantage of this; therefore, I don't have to worry about overfitting to the dataset. In this case, should I still add regularization to my model? The space of the data is very large, so I cannot just memorize every possible example.

If they are vectors of a different length than the watch-features, then you cannot do simple element-wise multiplication.  If they are scalars that are simply summed together then how does the network learn anything about the relationships between the context features?

1. Note Type (On/Off) Boolean
2. Note (Int 1-127)
3. Time (Int 0-480) 

I tried only training the LSTM on notes (Num 2), by doing a one-hot encoding and training. This was done using a softmax activation and getting the value using np.argmax(). This seems to work (work in the sense that the model was able to reduce loss on training and generate some notes), but without time and note type is not so useful by itself. But now how do I incorporate note type and time? 

I was thinking of two different ideas here:

1. Use sigmoid activation and one-hot encode each of the three and make a combined list for predictions.
2. Keep them as integers and train perhaps using a linear activaiton.

This is more like asking for your opinion because my knowledge about NLP is pretty limited and I believe my problem might be related to it.

I work on a marketing project. I have three years of data. Each customer has 12 months and 36 features. I was planning to treat it as sequence labelling but would like to solve to problem with an algorithm using Convolutional Neural Network (I completed the part using LSTM, pretty straightforward). I have millions of customers each year and I plan to treat `years` as channels (say, of image). Rows are months and columns are feature and depth is 3 years (basically, we can say input is 3d array). However, the problem is that each row is a sequence and it has a corresponding response variable. For sure, using pure CNN seems out of options. Is there any other methods that I can apply on such datasets? I also really would like to hear other alternatives that you can work on? ",0,1

they base their architecture one the following formula

where H are the layers, thetas are the parameters to optimize, A is the adjacency matrix of the input graph, and D is the normalized degree matrix of the input graph.

&amp;#x200B;

hence, to my understanding (and it is also stated clearly in the papers), a single datapoint for those kind of problems is a single graph (represented by its corresponding A and D matrices). so it may seem like this kind of arch is good for, say, learning if a graph has a certain property or not.

However, every project/library (including those of the original papers) that i found implement a network where the \*whole\* dataset is a single matrix (CORA/KARATE for example).

I came up with a deep learning project idea. It involves images as well as regular attributes and classifies (height, weight, name). The problem I came across is how do I combine this two different universes together in a meaningful way. I did some research and I found this idea of multimodal learning. Modalities refer to the different dimensions of perception. For humans it would be smell vision and so on. In all the research done so far the best approach I could find was building 2 NN's to do separate tasks and then combine them with another smaller NN that would adjust its weighted contribution. There are problems in this approach. 
     It fails to account for nuance between modalities and only looks at the bigger picture instead of going into detail. What I mean by that is that my non image data could work in different combinations with different aspects of the image. For example if the weight is this then the face shape does this and so on. In other words the approach above does not synthesize the different modalities but instead comes up with two conclusions and then kinda decides what to do. 
     Do you know any resources or ideas on this problem. 

Thank you.",1,1

Hello,

In a  dataset, the data are the average of vehicles speed in the points  (cells) of a map. I am trying to build a prediction model.

While  the inputs are the average of vehicles speed of all points in recent 40  min and the outputs are the next 10 min of all points.

If  there were 320 points on the map, the input shape = (320,20) and the  output shape =(320,5). The averages of vehicles speed are collected each  2 min in all points.

There are several such samples (n samples, x=(n,320,20), y=(n,320,5)).

If we visualize the average of the vehicles of a day in a plot, then a .gif file as below indicates the input and the output as *x* and *y*.

https://i.redd.it/2upenjlfwyc21.gif

Then we build a CNN model with 1 channel to considering the spatial-temporal features.

The codes of the final architecture of my model:

    model = models.Sequential() 
    model.add(Conv2D(256,(3, 3),
              activation='relu',
              input_shape=(320,20,1), 
              padding='same')) 
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))  
    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) 
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))  
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) 
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))  
    model.add(Flatten()) 
    model.add(Dense(1600))  
    model.summary()

The input\_shape=(320,20,1). I reshaped the output to 1600 (320\*5) which the final Dense layer expects.

While the output is 2d (320 cells and 5 times). Does it make the model bad learning?

Thank you

I had a floating thought in head. I'm not from deep learning or steganography domain so please feel free to correct my flying ideas.

Stegnalysis using deep learning :
Use a CNN to determine whether given random image is carrying any hidden information or not. To achieve this, train a CNN using datasets of different steganography methods. We currently want to accommodate 2-3 algorithms only. So we wish to train CNN first
 using a primitive steganography method like LSB(using a dataset created using LSB algorithm only). Then we train it using some different algorithm like Hugo (2nd dataset purely using algorithm Hugo). Then another different algorithm like s or j uniward.

At the end of this hardship, what we wish to achieve is : suppose we give a random image that may have been steganographed using the 3 algorithms we trainied(exclusively). Then the CNN should be able to tell if image is stego or not. And if stego, should try &amp; extract the hidden payload.

I explicitly state that I am a noob in both domains. And would work in the direction of suggestions provided as answers to this question. 

Notes : 
Only images are hidden in cover images.

I am about to develop a Deep Learning tool/framework in Python that ultimately will be run inside Jupyter lab. I need to choose a DL framework to be the backend of this tool.

&amp;#x200B;

I am familiar with both PyTorch and Keras/TensorFlow but I am still not sure which one should I use for this project.

&amp;#x200B;

My first idea is to use PyTorch as it works well with Python and it seems it would make a perfect combination with Jupyter environment. I also think it will be easier for me to develop some features with PyTorch.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the way PyTorch is executed makes it a better choice for Jupyter? However soon TF 2.0 will brings more eager execution, so I am also not sure about this.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that makes me doubt is that it is very easy to design/save/load networks with Keras API while with PyTorch it is sometimes not straightforward. For instance for CNNs you always need to manage the input size manually (or with extra functions) while with Keras you don't have to bother. Same for loading/saving models, it seems a bit easier with Keras.

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I still think that Keras API might be easier for users to design their own networks.

With so many frameworks out there, and fast changes in these frameworks, it is not easy to choose.

What would be your advice?

282,2019-1-31,2019,1,31,23,alpw8e,So I created my first DL model and I have questions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/alpw8e/so_i_created_my_first_dl_model_and_i_have/,Akainu18448,1548944463,"**1) How do you decide based on a data set what layers and hyperparameters to use?** 

The model that I created, I followed the steps that another guy was doing just so I could get my hands dirty and see something myself. He had a huge data set, but just by looking at the data set, I have no idea how to select the hyperparameters! Moreover, since the guy made a batch gradient descent model, it took a lot of time to train (I have a CPU sadly), which means I can't play around with all permutations of Conv2D, MaxPooling2D and other functions. Is there a clear cut way to at least have an idea just from the data set?

**2) How are competitions (say, on Kaggle) worth anything if everyone is basically just importing everything from DL libraries?**

Whether one guy wins or the other guy does seems to be only a matter of what functions he used. Conv2D + MaxPool + MaxPool + Conv2D could be the runner up while Conv2D+MaxPool+Conv2D+maxPool could be the winner. I'm not talking competition with the retards who'd use very low level functions here, but at the top, I can't see how the winner will have to rely solely on his knowledge to be more accurate - it's more of a chance, unlike programming.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) I'm still a beginner, but if all the work has already been done for me in the DL Libraries, what makes this difficult?** 

Seems like all that a company needs to be good at AI, is to get someone who can devote his time playing around with permutations of one-liner codes to finally score good on the metric and voila! What skills do I need to possess here that would give me an edge when sitting for the hiring process?

&amp;#x200B;

*----------------Note, I'm still a beginner here. My views are primarily based on the assignments I have done on Coursera, followed by this one model I made using the libraries. I suddenly seem to be losing that excitement, but I'm sure I'm missing something big here. Please go easy on me.----------------*",4,1
