Although there's plenty of research about an 'optimum price', no one really knows what it is for a given company.  


My approach is the following: Given a normalized stock price, amount of trade, and bid-ask spread, can deep learning predict in theory how likely a company is to vote for a stock split in an ordinary shareholders meeting?

  
I have over 20 years of data from my bachelor's thesis, however I only have \~500 splits in it, so the labels are very unbalanced. Is this a problem?  


I plan on using the window slicing method for data augmentation based on this work [https://aaltd16.irisa.fr/files/2016/08/AALTD16\_paper\_9.pdf](https://aaltd16.irisa.fr/files/2016/08/AALTD16_paper_9.pdf)

In a dataset, the data are the average of vehicles speed in the points (cells) of a map. I am trying to build a prediction model.

While the inputs are the average of vehicles speed of all points in recent 40 min and the outputs are the next 10 min of all points.

If there were 320 points on the map, the input shape = (320,20) and the output shape =(320,5). The averages of vehicles speed are collected each 2 min in all points.

There are several such samples (n samples, x=(n,320,20), y=(n,320,5)).

The codes of the final architecture of my model:

    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(256,(3, 3),
             activation='relu',
             input_shape=(320,20,1), padding='same'))

I have a friend who runs an online store. Normally, he runs into competitors who use a similar /exact product name to out-price him so we want to monitor/price beat the competitors if possible

I'm trying to see if we can automate this and we do not want to rely entirely on the product name / but instead, the images are what we want to use to ensure the competitors are selling our exact products

Then I know how to train the weights for a single layer, so is it possible to train the GRU layer by layer?

In a sense that, find the derivatives wrt the 2nd layer's inputs, thus find *L**X*2*t*,for all *t*, which is identical to *L**h*1*t*,  (thus, the derivatives wrt the 2nd layer's GRU inputs are to be used as  the derivatives wrt to the 1st layer's GRU's output) then train the 2nd  layer's GRU, then using the derivatives wrt to the 2nd layer's inputs,  use the same method that I used to train the 2nd layer, into training  the 1st layer's GRU?

I'm working on a personal project where I need to classify an image as belonging to one of two categories - for the sake of privacy, let's consider them to be problematic and non-problematic.

The data I have is in the longitudinal form, i.e., each entity has multiple images associated with it. The distribution for this mapping is highly skewed. For e.g., one entity has only ~30 images associated with itself, while another has ~800.

Since considering these images as IID made no sense to me, I decided to split the images into the regular train-val-test folds by ensuring that ALL images associated an entity should be in the same fold. I am also ensuring that the class distribution remain same while splitting the data.

The result is very weird - in about 15 epochs, my model overfits the data pretty easily (The train loss decreases almost linearly per epoch, but the validation loss keeps fluctuating around the same value, sometimes even increasing.)

However, the model gives an amazing prediction on the test set.

This is, in my opinion, some sort of sampling bias. The model seems to have found features that generalize well for the train and test set, but not on the validation set.

Any recommendations on how I could avoid this (possible) sampling bias? I've tried building a ""mixture-of-experts"" model (Hinton's course) with the appropriate loss, but even that doesn't seem to be working out well for me.

If I split the data of EACH entity equally (3 parts) and place each slice in each fold, that would be a very bad idea, right? I would essentially be bleeding information.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Okay, so what I understand here is - you have a training set and a development set. If the machine wrongly classifies an object as a cat, it has a bias error in it. Because this is something that repeated examples of supervised learning won't solve - it's inherent in the machine.

Variance depends on how different the examples are. Suppose you give it 10 different pictures of cats in various resolutions, angles and stuff like that. If it doesn't perform well in that but performs well in the supervised learning examples, it is not something inherent in the machine (since it does well in supervised learning cases). So if you give it time and more examples, it will eventually get it correct. This is the variance error, not the bias error.",2,1

&amp;#x200B;

Real-time object detection and classification with DeepLearning on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+

without connecting to any external web/cloud services

Our approach:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Object detection

HoughCircle Detection (OpenCV)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Object classification

A specially optimized deep learning network is used, which is also performant on computers with limited resources without GPU and can nevertheless achieve relatively high accuracies. Only a small training and test data set are available for the eight different euro coins: 1281 photos for training, 707 for testing. Since the training data set is minimal, so-called transfer learning is used. A pre-trained deep learning network is used, which was trained on the ImageNet training dataset (approx. 1.2 million images from 1000 categories). To make the classification more robust against rotations, brightness, contrast etc., the training images were additionally rotated randomly, and brightness and contrast were changed (data augmentation).

&amp;#x200B;

Achieved validation accuracy: 93.3%\*

&amp;#x200B;

Test accuracy achieved: 93.4%\*

&amp;#x200B;

Runtime for classification: 50ms

[Detection of wheat grains in Kasha](https://i.redd.it/drs03hpuiv321.gif)

This project was submitted to the TensorFlow Lite mailing list yesterday:  


**Inspiration:** *Having been diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I have to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. Long story short: buckwheat (also know as ""kasha"" in the U.S.) is gluten-free. The problem is that sometimes buckwheat groats are contaminated with wheat grains (which contain gluten) due to transportation and packagecircumstances. So I have to sort out such grains before cooking. That is how the idea of this project was born.*  
The project might just be object detection - but I really like the practical use case! Especially as someone who has a family member with Celiac.

I want to use a feed forward NN where the input is a vector of different types of time series. Here are the three types of time series I'm using:

1) I know the actual distribution of this input and it has a known trend overtime. This means that I can use a Z-normalization or a min-max normalization to be between \[0,1\]. 

2) The distribution is unknown and unbounded. I tried to use a running-average Z-normalization (compute the mean and std of that variable up until that time). 

3) A discrete set of values {h,2h,...,Nh} where h and N are known. Their values are much smaller than the other categories (h = 1/252 and N is a small known positive integer). For example: {1/252,2/252,...,15/252} and they are equally possible to be observed.

My questions are:

A) Should I try to use the same normalization for each input or should I try different normalization for each of the input categories?

B) Following on question A), is the goal of normalizing the features is to have similar domains for each feature? For example, a Z-normalization would be possible for the categories 1-2. Should I also use a Z-normalization for the third category? The third category is not at not Gaussian at all, it's a discrete uniform. 

My overall comprehension of normalizing the features is that they should be in the same domain since when you take a gradient step, you use a common learning rate for each feature. Having the same domain for each feature should help the learning overtime. Is this correct?

I have spent countless hours trying to install old versions of stuff, with no success. In other cases, the code is set up to run on standard datasets, but I struggle (and fail) to get it to work with images I select or any resolution other than the default.

When my input shape is (x, y) with z number of filters in all types of convolutional layers (1D, casual), the output is of shape (x, z). I'd like my output to be of shape (x, 1), and so I changed the number of filters for the very last Conv1D layer to be 1 and got my desired output shape.

I separated the dataset to 2 part, with one containing 0-4 and another containing 5-9. I used the former dataset to train a CNN, which is consisted of  a dimension reduction net (from 28\*28-d to 3-d) and a classifier (from 3-d to 5 classes). After training, the CNN can reach 99% accuracy.

Then, I discarded the classifier in the CNN and only kept the dimension reduction net. I tested the dimension reduction net with the latter dataset, which contains 5-9, and found it really cool, as you can see in the 3-d scatter plot with each color representing a number from 5 to 9.

Here it would seem that the network (fully convolutional encoder) doen't have to trow away any information. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need your help, for this is somewhat confusing.

*Note: with default-ish parameters, the input is 128x128x3 while the latent space is 32x32x256*

I have implemented a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network:

    # layer 1
    input_layer = keras.engine.input_layer.Input(shape=(8192, 4))
    lstm1 = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, 4), units=32)(input_layer)
    lstm2 = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, 4), units=32, go_backwards=True)(input_layer)
    merge1 = concatenate([lstm1, lstm2])
    
    output_layer = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, 32), units=1)(merge1)

I have also implemented an LSTM-based (denoising) auto-encoder:

    input_layer = keras.engine.input_layer.Input(shape=(8192, 4))
    
    # encoder
    encoder = LSTM(input_shape=(8192, 4), units=32, go_backwards=True)(input_layer)

    # decoder
    decoder = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, 32), units=1, go_backwards=True)(rep_vec)

Turns out, the Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network learns pretty well on my dataset, while the LSTM-based (denoising) auto-encoder does not. 

I subsequently tried to make my denoising auto-encoder's encoder and decoder out of Bidirectional LSTM-based layers:

    input_layer = keras.engine.input_layer.Input(shape=(8192, 4))
    
    # encoder
    lstm1 = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, 4), units=num_units)(input_layer)
    lstm2 = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, 4), units=num_units, go_backwards=True)(input_layer)
    merge1 = concatenate([lstm1, lstm2])
    
    rep_vec = RepeatVector(8192)(merge1)
    
    # layer 2
    lstm3 = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, num_units), units=num_units)(rep_vec)
    lstm4 = LSTM(return_sequences=True, input_shape=(8192, num_units), units=1, go_backwards=True)(rep_vec)

&amp;#x200B;

However, I usually update the theta associated with the bias and sometimes those theta's change in such a way while doing gradient descent, that it's as if it's just another x(input unit) that has a theta associated with it, with the only difference being that the bias unit never changes.  


In that case, is it really shifting the curve? I don't think so. Perhaps, if the curve needed to be shifted for the ideal model, and because I remembered to include the bias unit, the Neural net found the correct weights(thetas), then yes I'd say the bias did shift it, but aren't those cases really rare? I mean, if we are doing gradient descent with some small learning rate alpha, I still believe that the bias's weights will change to just play a part in finding the right curve, and not really the placement of the curve, and thereby just acting as another input unit like the rest.
