I know this is a pretty dead subreddit from the looks of it, but I just wanted to introduce myself! I'm a pretty new listener to kpop, but not to the korean entertainment industry (long time lover of kdramas, but I recently branched into variety shows where I met Jackson on Roommate) and after being instilled so many GOT7 introductions on that show, I decided to check them out, and I just have to say WOW.

For a rookie group, I'm really enjoying their songs. Definitely has a really fun vibe to it and I'm LOVING them! Even as a guy, I can have my guy biases and that has to be JB and Jackson. So talented, and I can't wait to hear more of their stuff!",2,2

- Group shots of the whole group, ideally those without too much going on in the background;  
- Individual shots, preferably head-and-shoulders (portrait) pics, of each member 

The more recent the better, but anything works really. Higher quality and the bigger the better (since I can always make them smaller but not reliably make them bigger). They don't need to be official pics either, though those are more likely to be clearer. 

Please &amp; thank you! And I promise to share the results once I've got the project done, though that may take some time.

The product had eaten off my muscle, and my skin peeled like an onion. But she was too embarrassed to talk to a doctor, even though her ass was rotting off. It looked pretty good, especially considering that only a few years ago her haunches had mutated into a distorted heap of poisoned flesh and immense pain. These procedures can trigger a strong autoimmune response as the body attempts to expel the foreign substance, resulting in inflammatory reactions such as polyps, boils, skin discoloration, and even necrosis. She wouldn t tell me who had administered the procedure, but did admit that her clients recommended a certain spa in the area. Due to the challenge of reversing such a botched and unsanctioned operation and the resulting potential for legal liability, many doctors will not help a patient like Oscarina. The horror that befell Oscarina Busse s backside began in July 2009. The cheeks of her ass drooped down, loaded with a stew of poisonous goop that collected around her lower buttocks. Unable to bear the discomfort caused by her rapidly worsening deformity, she told me that she opened up to a client at her salon. After going to consultations with doctors, their reactions made me think I was going to die Oscarina said. Minutes later, under hot fluorescent lights, Oscarina pulled up her dress. She wore a form fitting pantssuit, high heels that cackled against the salon s linoleum floor, and a citrusy perfume that permeated the room as she paced back and forth from the shampoo bowls to her styling chair. For Oscarina, on the other hand, it was more about the shorter recovery time for injections than their lower cost. What had once stood high and felt supple to the touch had become hot and hard and stinging. In October, I met Oscarina at the beauty salon she owns in Coral Gables, Florida, to better understand why someone would inject their butt with toxic chemicals. Constantino Mendieta leans on his McLaren sports carone of his many automobilesin front of his massive Pinecrest, Florida, home. She described to me the feeling of a syringe piercing deep into her butt and excreting as much as 600cc of industrial silicone simply as filling as if her butt were a water balloon stretched over the nozzle of a garden hose. Hence it has been illegal to inject fluids like silicone into the body for cosmetic purposes since the late 60s, so these butt pumping procedures are typically performed by back alley quacksrogue nut jobs with suitcases full of dirty needles and flasks full of muck. According to a comprehensive history of silicone injections in the US edited by Harvard Law professor Peter Barton Hutt, 555cc of silicone can break apart into 30 billion small globules once inside the body, and each of those 30 billion pieces has the potential to cause an infectious reaction. However, many women choose the black market procedure to save money. Fat transfer and butt implants require weeks of recuperation, and the final results don t settle in for months. It s important to point out that there are legal butt enhancing procedures. She abruptly stopped doing the client s hair and asked the woman to come look at her bare ass in the back room. The 35 year old Floridian felt a dull but persistent itch deep in the meat of her buttocks, one that was impossible to scratch. When it breaks down, which can happen in a matter of hours or over the course of several years, it becomes almost impossible to completely identify or locate. The crude inflation procedure consists of shooting a liquid substance such as silicone or mineral oil directly into a client s butt cheeks and hips through a syringe. It wasn t until she decided to undergo another pumping procedure performed by a different spa in 2009 that everything went, quite literally, to shit. There is no substance that is safe to inject into your body to create more volume, not even medical grade silicone, but these black market butt doctors have, according to victims, allegedly used harsh substances like concrete and the industrial silicone sold at hardware stores in their procedures. It wasn t because I didn t have it. Her flesh started to crust and painfully peel off until, a few months later, the whole mess collapsed like a badly baked cake. I got the shots she told me as she ran a tail comb through the frizzy hair of a teenage girl, and six months later my butt turned purple. No one here is ever happy with their body the beautician said to me sheepishly. Legal implants and fat transfers can cost up to 10,000 more than their illicit counterparts. So that s exactly what Oscarina did, ordering her first set of injections at the beginning of the summer in 2002 for about 3,000. These hookups happen through word of mouth, as well as via forums and social media sites. After the injections, the exterior flesh wounds are sometimes closed with Super Glue to prevent the toxic slop from leaking out. It was at that moment that she knew she had to swallow her pride and seek real help. But the number is definitely growing; due to the proliferation of reported disfiguring cases like Oscarina s and even deaths, law enforcement officials and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons view black market butt injections as a burgeoning epidemic in the US. These substances have also been known to migrate through the body and fuse themselves to organs, or enter into the bloodstream, spreading infection throughout the body and causing septic shockwhich can lead to the amputation of infected body parts or, in the worst cases, death. When I saw her face, I knew it was terrible Oscarina said to me, staring off into the direction of the private room. Injections result in a new rear end almost instantaneously, as if you d put your backside in a butt microwave. She s one of the few women who, after realizing something was very wrong with her new ass, managed to find a doctor who was willing to surgically remove the substances from her body and rebuild her butt, possibly saving her life in the process. It s impossible to know what the problem might have been the second time aroundit could have been the reaction between the new shots and the first round, or perhaps the new shots featured a lower grade of silicone that infected Oscarina s ass. Like thousands of women across the globe and increasingly in the US, Oscarina was suffering from the side effects of a black market butt injection. In Miami, America s epicenter for clandestine butt surgery, it s as easy as walking into a beauty spa where, among the massages, aromatherapy, and saunas, customers can allegedly order a bevy of illegal silicone butt shots off a secret menu. It wasn t until the winter that Oscarina finally shared her plight with anyone. The FDA deems both implants and fat transferwhere fat is liposuctioned from areas like the patient s stomach and transferred to his or her fannyto be safe when conducted by a board certified plastic surgeon. Banks, a dancer at the King of Diamonds strip club, showing off her massive, illegally injected ass in a backstage dressing room. She told me that the whole ordeal is something she feels gravely foolish about now, considering she was blessed with a shapely Dominican figure. Although it s illegal to cram someone s can full of mysterious substances, finding a butt doctor in the United States is like buying drugs; you just have to know a guy who knows a guy. ",0,1

Thirteen needs the Stranger s help to make sure he isn t next in line, which he believes is too little a reason for him to get involved. He takes the call, and within moments assumes his more familiar look to return the call in person: True to his word, the Haunted Highwayman returns, ready to kill Dr. After a rocky first issue or two, the team of Didio and Anderson found a nice groove that was distinct from a lot of the other New 52 books, one that I thought fit the character quite well while also doing something new with him. Included in the second issue of CCC was the cover to Dynamic Classics #3, done by none other than Jim Aparo. There s also more humor than has been seen previously, which works well as a nice contrast to the ever serious Stranger. He speaks of a third sinner still walking the Earth, and of an equally mysterious box that Pandora has. Whatever this magazine paid for it, they got a good deal. And that he and his team have to clean up the mess. Using his powers, he returns home, to find: The Stranger then sends out a mystic net, searching for his family, and he finds nothing they could be alive, dead, or hidden in some hidden pocket of existence. The art of Brent Anderson and Philip Tan is really coming together, with the Stranger doing a lot of the cool fading in and out of the mist stuff that he did in his heyday. When they are alone, the man and the Stranger talk about heady subjects, like faith and fate. Back outside, Madame Xanadu tries to use her powers to find Zee and Tim, to no avail. Send us an e mail at: Also, you can leave a comment on our sites: THE AQUAMAN SHRINE. If this blog isn t enough for all you Phantom Stranger fans and how could it be? Original Jim Aparo art does it get any better? I have not read Justice Lea gue Dark before, so I really have no idea what s going on in this book. THE LANTERNCAST Subscribe via iTunes: Intro theme, That Time is Now. Pandora by Geoff Johns and Carlos D Anda. The Stranger returns to the other reality, to find his wife gone. So I m thrilled that he s come on board, and I look forward to seeing what JMD can do with the Stranger now that he s more than a guest star in someone else s book. The Stranger asks for the coin, but Constantine refuses, disappearing into the darkness. But she does suggest that first on the list of suspects who might know is: I m happy to say that, IMO, this new Phantom Stranger series is getting better issue by issue. The short story opens on a man, lying dead in the street as onlookers wonder what happened. He asks the Stranger to help keep an eye on his family in his absence. IATPS suggests you visit the, a page created by a fellow Fantom Stranger. This is a great piece, full of typical Aparo movement and dynamics. They get bored and go inside big mistake. HH doesn t care, but is perplexed as to why his flaming noose hasn t burned it s way through the Stranger s neck yet. Meanwhile, Amethyst, Frankenstein, and Black Orchid are hanging out on the steps of the House of Mystery, waiting for the others to show up. After all, this book is littered with former Phantom Stranger guest stars like Deadman, Black Orchid, and Frankenstein. Though I suggest turning down the volume on your computer first Abduction by Dan Didio, J.M. The Stranger reaches out to her, only to be met by two mystical guns that Pandora fires at the Stranger s head. Frankenstein and then Deadman try to stop him, much to their chagrin. But when you re talking about ghosts, demons, and the like, are any of them ever gone for good? THE FIRE AND WATER PODCAST : Episode 36. This issue of The Phantom Stranger opens with one of the most monumental decisions the man has ever had to make: The Stranger, known in this existence as Philip, is out shopping with his wife. When he gets close, he is repelled by the Stranger s cloak, which possesses some sort of power the Highwayman cannot comprehend. After checking in on them, his wife shoves Philip into a dressing room, where what awaits him is more than just trying on some clothes: John Constantine, an old associate if not friend, exactly of the Stranger s, asks him to consider joining Justice League Dark, which is a pretty impressive. This was my favorite issue of the series so far. Enter The House of Mystery by Jeff Lemire, Graham Nolan, and Victor Drujiniu. Thirteen explains where all this began: in the 1800s, with an ancestor of the doctor s who was also in the business of ghost hunting. Later, another neighbor gets a call on his cell, but it s for the Stranger. Shag takes the week off and I welcome Special Guest Co Host Chad Bokelman The Lanterncast to discuss the history of one of our favorite DC Comics characters, The Phantom Stranger. With his wife, he attends a neighborhood party, which is a send off to one of them, a husband and father who is going overseas for six months for work. He frets over his two children, even though they are currently being babysat by a teenager named Chris. Thirteen tries to beg for the Stranger s life, saying it was he who drew the Stranger there. I can t tell you how happy that makes me. The Stranger holds him off, but the Highwayman insists he will overpower them both. DeMatteis, Brent Anderson, Phillip Tan, and Rob Hunter. With dawn approaching, the Highwayman must depart, but he promises he will return the next night and end this once and for all : With the Stranger recovering, Dr. ",0,1

0,2016-1-2,2016,1,2,4,3z1mug,[Discussion] Which was your favorite year-end performance by GOT7?,Infinitize-It,1451675243,"GOT7 and JYPE worked hard this year to come up with a different performance of If You Do at each year-end Gayo and MAMA this year. Which was your favorite one? Whether it be for the remix, the dance changes, tricks, or any other reason.

For reference: [MAMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWzj7_W_eYY) | [SBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S2CbVnW-7o) | [KBS broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IeN3WKad1M)/[KBS wide shot fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbQAPtb7cEs)/[KBS close-up fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ4zoxFOwDM) | [MBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnIgHWZtDGI)

My favorite was the KBS performance. There was some really great martial arts tricking in the intro (it's a shame it wasn't all captured) and I really liked the remix starting from the bridge. Special shoutout though to Jackson's trust fall from the box at MBC.

BONUS: GOT7 did extra duty, having a special colaboration stage at each festival. Which was your favorite among these?

[MAMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijIAsl0OM8) | [SBS](https://youtu.be/kOFPkoU7AA0?t=106) | [KBS broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ixRP5KB3hg)/[KBS GOT7 dance fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HN5ndQ-QoM)/[KBS group dance fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZD6g1Vdgw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=66) | [MBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwFu9UCsQv0)

This is a hard choice for me, but again, I have to give it to KBS. There was lots of martial arts tricking, and some that we haven't seen from GOT7 before, like BamBam's swing. Plus the group dance at the end was really well done, incorporating point dances from all 3 groups.",2,8

I'm not sure if it's necessarily helpful to be getting feedback from people that are already fans, as opposed to feedback from non-fans to see what it would take to make them fans, but I think it's really cool how JYPE is open to feedback. Maybe it's because I've never been so deep into any other fandom before, but this is the first time I'm seeing something like this, and it kind of makes you feel valued as a fan.

The deadline to complete the survey is January 31 (KST). Take a look and fill it out to get your opinions in. Also, be constructive in your responses! Try not to just give short answers that JYPE won't be able to do anything with.",3,2

The episodes are divided into segments following different groups of people, so the links go straight to the beginning of the segment in which Jackson appears. 

* [Episode 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC83VyI_xuM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=983) making kimchi with Soomi and Park Myungsoo.

* [Epsiode 24](https://youtu.be/1Us2xl2WDXo?t=2797) marks the beginning of his appearance with Twice's Tzuyu for Lunar New Year, where Kyungkyu and Youngnam ""teach"" them about Korean culture.

* [Epsiode 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiUbwKHwDbs) has Jackson, Tzuyu, Kyungkyu, and Youngnam hiking up a mountain, trying weird Korean food, and visiting a Korean spa (for Jackson's like 5th time on TV).

* [Episode 26 part 1](https://youtu.be/srSeym6F2ZQ?t=778) has Jackson and Tzuyu visiting Chinatown. [Part 2](https://youtu.be/srSeym6F2ZQ?t=2352) is the start of his guesting with Twice's Nayeon as part of a panel talking about the concerns of people of different age groups.

* [Episode 27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvHd0Xtwq-E) is the conclusion of the panel, with Jackson and the others playing the ""Of Course"" game from X-man.

* [Episode 28](https://youtu.be/5PojZeJ4XNs?t=1539) is the start of Jackson's regular appearances with g.o.d's Joonhyung, including Jackson picking up Joon from the airport and having an MT with the rest of the cast.

Upcoming episodes will have Joon visiting GOT7's dorm to lay down some rules (filmed before Yugyeom's graduation) and Jackson and Joon getting Korean lessons from 2PM's Wooyoung.",0,2

Day 1

There will probably be more complete fancams tomorrow (if fans can sneak their phones out to record without security finding out) but here are what I see as some highlights that I've seen from the concert.

* JB and Youngjae's Duet [""1:31AM""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm_2EVEF9xk&amp;feature=youtu.be) (written by JB). I think most fans can agree that this was one of the most heartbreaking moments of the night. With JB's vocal recording, close-ups of the chair for when he is supposed to sing, and Youngjae standing there on stage by himself, choking up at the end. I made the mistake of reading about this stage while on the bus to work, and I was in tears, so I had to stop myself from reading anything else about the concert until I got home from work.

* Mark and Junior singing a song Junior composed, ""Higher"". I haven't seen any fancams of this yet, but I hope there will be one. Apparently [Mark was in a pink suit and Junior was in a blue one.](https://twitter.com/flawlesswang/status/726017237845315587)

* Jackson, BamBam, and Yugyeom singing Jackson's song ""YOLO."" Finally we get to hear the song Jackson has been waiting to show everyone. [Short fancam](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726018503245860868) (of course there's dabbing) and [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3RUCdJbl1U).

* Girl group dances. But first, an introductory VCR which includes [BamBam nearly killing JB trying to be sexy.](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726021647963066368) Mark, Junior, and Youngjae covered [GFriend's Me Gustas Tu](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726021477770780672) and (JB), Jackson, BamBam, and Yugyeom did [Red Velvet's Dumbx3.](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726022639353892864)

* And of course, [JB's surprise appearance at the end.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_W4f7vMQI8) I haven't watched it through yet, but somewhere in that video, there is [this moment](https://twitter.com/GOT7jjai/status/726091221416992769) where Jackson tries to stop JB from bowing too deeply, but JB brushes his hand away and bows normally. You can really tell how much the other members care about and missed him. They never let the fans forget that he was missing, and even had the crowd [chanting JB](https://twitter.com/GOT_7_CHAI/status/726030435067662336) at the start of Just Right.

Feel free to spazz in the comments or share other things you think were highlights!

EDIT:

Day 2

* 1:31 AM was actually co-composed and co-written by JB and Youngjae. And now there's a [full fancam!](http://www.weibo.com/p/230444328b4d4fcffcb11a485959b35724ffd7) Here's also a [rough translation](https://twitter.com/tuanique/status/726388302425661440) and God, I don't know how Youngjae was able to keep it together for the whole song considering everything that happened in the days leading up to the concert.

* [Full Audio](https://soundcloud.com/marknior-markjin/higher) of Higher, and the [VCR](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726318492744478720) leding up to it!

* Jackson's song is actually called ""WOLO"" (We Only Live Once). A clearer [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wJBjcQjZH8) and the [VCR](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726319646194814977) leading up to it.

* [Day6](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726338281953054720) dancing to Home Run on the dance cam.

* [Jackson](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726346365916184576) being worried about JB's back again.

* There was a surprise event today where GOT7's family wrote messages for their sons and to Ahgases. [All of their parents were there,](https://twitter.com/linbea945/status/726429728400240640) except for Jackson's because of his mom's health (which made me realize that this must make him extra sensitive about JB's back). [Thread of translations](https://twitter.com/shmesm/status/726358500289306626) for some, [Mark's mom's](https://twitter.com/GOT7jjai/status/726354342555602944), [Mark's sister's](https://twitter.com/jinxpil/status/726359213505536000), and [JB's mom's](https://twitter.com/fuckboytuan/status/726408719207014401). JB also sang a little bit of [Forever Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ4zgN_4Jaw&amp;feature=youtu.be) during this montage.

Bonus! [Papa Tuan](https://twitter.com/linbea945/status/726381535025319937) wearing BamBam's shoes.

The songs they pick are originally by singers from that country and seem to have all been slow ballads.

Shanghai and Guangzhou [ (I Love You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqr_h2SNRM)

Bangkok [ (Love You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq-mg91yajE)

Singapore [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHZXv7YgnE)

So any guesses or wishes for their US concerts? I would say Justin Bieber's Love Yourself because they've been singing that a lot recently but 1) he's Canadian and 2) it isn't really a love song. Maybe something by Chris Brown? Yugyeom and I think JB have said they've been inspired by him. With You would fit, but that might just be my inner Inspirit talking. Maybe John Legend's All of Me for something more recent? I feel like people would die if they did that.

Edit: Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud is also a possibility if they just go for a pop song and not necessarily an American singer.",7,5

Important Notice for those who plan on attending the #FLYinDALLAS show tonight.

It comes with great disappointment that due to GOT7s Youngjae falling ill, he will be unable to perform for the Dallas show tonight being held at the Verizon Theatre. Although this is the last thing we all would have wanted, it was ultimately decided that his health comes first, and giving him the rest that he needs at this time is most important.

We strongly encourage those who planned on attending the Dallas show to still come out and show support for GOT7, as this will be the groups first full concert in the US. However, if you no longer wish to attend the show due to Youngjaes inability to perform tonight, then we will issue you a full refund. Please understand that if you do choose to receive a refund for this show, then you are forfeiting your ticket, along with any benefits it might come with. In other words, you cannot attend the show and request a refund as well.

Please also note that this refund offer is only valid for customers who purchased their tickets through AXS or StubHub, as these are the official ticketing and partner sites for this show.

More information on how and when you can request a refund will be posted shortly.

Once again, we are extremely saddened by these unforeseen circumstances, and we at SubKulture Entertainment wish a swift recovery for Youngjae.

As of now, the other cities are not affected. If there are any changes, we will update everyone.
Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this notice, please send an email to info@subkultureent.com.",0,10

The only other kpop concert she (or I) had been to was Epic High in Atl last year.  

___

We went to the mall across the street first, about two hours before the show, to enjoy some icecream and relax. No sooner did we sit down in the food court did my daughter start seeing Got7 shirts everywhere. We saw three girls with High Touch wrist bands. My daughter was scolding me about staring at them because she was kind of nervous. I called them over anyway to talk about how they managed to get their P2 tickets, when I tried so hard but only managed meager tickets because of web browser issues.  

Soon enough my daughter and the girls were in full Got7 and kpop conversational bliss. My daughter has little to no opportunity to engage in kpop conversation with anyone living on the South side of ATL.  

The three girls were from Ashville, and there with one their moms. Out of nowhere the girls start freaking out. JRE, a popular Youtuber, had just walked into the courtyard and sat down just 20 feet from us. One of the girls wanted a picture with him, but was too nervous and freaked out to go over there. They didn't want to go over there for fears of annoying him, to which I responded that it was his job and responsibility as a celebrity personality to expect this behavior from fans. If he was with his family, sure it would be rude, but this was a full-on celebrity moment and he should expect it.  My daughter asked if she really wanted a picture and that she would go over there with her and get one. So they all went over to JRE's table and got selfies with him. They were so excited when they returned from his table. I was so proud of my daughter for stepping up and pushing through the fear!  

Afterwards the three girls went and got food and actually came over and sat with my daughter. My daughter was so excited to encounter such nice people, and this wouldn't disappoint her the rest of the evening.  

It was time to go get into parking. Instagrams and Twitters were exchanged and off we went to the venue. Parking was a breeze with the prebought parking ticket. We walked up the stairs to the front of the venue and BAM the massive crowd was assembling. Throughout the sea of iGOT7's were all varieties of Got7 merch you could ever imagine. My daughter knew them all and was in awe. The highlight of this time was when JRE arrived and the crowd went nuts and rushed over to meet him.  

The doors finally opened and in we all went in the most orderly of manners. I'm from a heavy metal background and show entree crowds are not always the most pleasant. I instinctively went into positional guard mode. I was on alert looking for anyone attempting to cut in line and take our precious spots. Soon I realized this was not necessary. I was very happy and surprised to see the calm stream of the crowd into the venue. No pushing, no shoving, no cutting in line...a thing of beauty really!  

Upon entering the venue we got in the long line for the meager merch selection. WHY ON EARTH they didn't have a wider variety of merch is beyond me. Do they not understand that we are a kpop merch starved people over here in the USA? We would have bought everything and anything with Got7 on it.  

I saw a few people cut in the merch line. Understand that i'm 6'3"" and about 290 LBS. I towered above ever single person in this place. I resign myself to just giving dirty looks though. ""This isn't Slayer"", I kept telling myself.  

After gather my daughter's merch we head up to our seats. Once there, and with full confidence that everyone there was the same as her, my daughter instantly made friends with everyone around her. I just sat in my chair recovering from the massive ammount of stairs I just climbed, and gazing over the massive sellout crowd and sea of green light sticks (well more like a pond than a sea I guess).  

---

SHOW TIME!!!  

Let me preface this with just saying i'm not your ordinary kpop fan dad.  
Read my story here: [How I got into KPOP](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/4lgay0/us_folks_how_did_you_fall_into_the_pitfall_of_kpop/)  

The show was absolutely amazing to me. Frankly, I LOVE ""Moriagatte Yo"" because of its hard hitting. Most other Got7 is a little soft for me. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Got7, I'm just a huge fan of heavier stuff. I still have Got7 in my playlist and enjoy them greatly.  

I also created an MP3 playlist of Fly Seoul setlist, and have listened to this leading up to the show. So I knew every single song they play (that I could hear over the screaming).  

They played the Seoul setlist almost exactly with a few exceptions. They danced awesomely. Their singing was great LIVE! So many of the videos of MAMA awards and such have so much lipsyncing that I was worried I would have to deal with this, but was pleasantly surprised they were really singing! I loved their interactions with the audience. I ever really loved their VCR videos they played. They were definitely high energy all the way through.  

My favorite song was the combination VCR/Live performance of Confession Song. At first, with the video getting the audience to sing, it felt like we were all singing ""I Love You"" to them, and then when they came out, they sang it to US! Very moving and the crowd loved it too! The dance competition was also awesome. Great job those of you that got chosen to dance on camera!  

BIG shout out to the girl that did the beat boxing! Good job!  

Of course my daughter's bias is Bam Bam. Although I could easily recognize him, I was reminded it was him singing/rapping by this massive pain in my left ear from her screaming at break glass levels.

As far as expectations go I give this show a 11/10 really. And I don't give credit lightly. I've seen some of the all-time great performances in rock and roll and classical music. They seriously brung it big time. KUDOS Got7!  

OH...and I have it recorded...they PROMISED they would return to ATL. I'm holding them to their word. ATL is so often overlooked for kpop concerts it's not even funny.  

Funny addition...  

While leaving and walking down the stairs inside the venue some girl behind us is just calling out in desperation, ""Does anyone have a battery charger?"" I turned and just casually said, ""um...I have one."" We move off to the side and plugged her up to my battery. Again my daughter went into full kpop conversation mode and the two just chattered on like long lost friends. The girl was from Miami and traveled to ATL to see Got7. She informed us that Monsta X ans Seventeen were coming to Miami in Nov....hmmm *wink* lol. Once her phone was charged enough to turn on she messaged her friend that was over in High Touch land. All of a sudden the girl squealed, ""Remember when one of the members grabbed the phone from the crowd and sang to it? That was MY FRIEND'S phone!!!"" Again her and my daughter exchanged social media and off we went for the ride home.  

On the way home we stopped at Waffle House for an after concert meal, as was always tradition in my rock concert days.  

Thus ended an AWESOME evening with my precious daughter, an awesome crowd of people, and a most awesome kpop group!

This morning I wake up to news that Jackson was in a car accident with sasaengs. Apparently the day before staff chased away fans before they could see Jackson. So what do the obsessive sasaengs do? They hire a van to chase after Jackson's. While Jackson was in the back asleep in his van, the sasaengs are speeding following behind. Jackson's van ends up having to slam on the breaks causing the saseangs van to slam into them from behind. Thankfully no one was seriously injured but Jackson has pain on his waist. Staff say he may have pulled it. Here is why I say we don't deserve this Angel...he went to the ""Fans"" in the van and asked THEM were they alright. He didn't get mad like anyone else would but he was worried about them. I truly hope those girls learn their lesson and I hope nothing like this happens again. ",4,19

So I thought I would compile a list of group orders for various countries that will offer to open albums and try to give everyone their preferred version(s) given the haul that they get. It might be a little more expensive than other places and there's no guarantee that you will definitely get your choices, but IMO it's worth it to not get completely random albums, especially if you're buying multiple ones.

If you know of a trustworthy group order for your country, comment with it and I will add it to the list. Or if you don't see your country on the list, comment and I will keep an eye out for one. Let's try and get GOT7 some more music show wins!

I am certain I have the majority of shows they have been on, on the spreadsheet already. However I know I am missing a few shows. It'd be awesome if any of you could tell me what I'm missing and I'll be sure to add it.

There is also a 'Special/Cuts' tab for other fun little things(Concert/fanmeet VCRs, small variety cuts). Just give me suggestions what to put there and I'll add it!

I've listed their shows according to their release dates ~~(apart from GOT2DAY S1 and GOT7 Now, as they were originally released on FB and I can't be bothered scrolling back to the 'If You Do' and 'Just Right'eras for accurate release dates).~~

-------
**NOTE:** I have not added every single show each individual member has been on, hence the Jackson masterlist someone had already made off to the side, as I feel like that'd be a bit much. However, if people think it's a good idea to add to the spreadsheet, I will.

Additionally, I have not added their radio shows they've featured on, apart from radio game show cuts in the Special/Cuts tab, due to me not keeping track of all their radio appearances.

 However, if someone does have a list of all the radio shows they've been on, I'd be happy to add it to the spreadsheet.

Albums are 26 USD including shipping worldwide. Albums are opened and you can request a certain member photobook. There are no guarantees though, because she is limited by what she was randomly given, and what people have already claimed. You can also order a copy of the just-released [Urbanlike magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lUrGhHZ2I) featuring JB and Jinyoung for an extra cost (you can contact her for exact details once you make your order).

She is also offering various extras for free, including ""GOT7's It's Skin masks, NBA bromides and posters, and various other GOT7 merch based on the number of albums ordered."" And lastly, she is collecting **messages/letters for the members** to give to them during the fansign. She can only offer each person 1 page because she has to pay for printing, but you can write messages to as many members as you want as long as it fits on that page (i.e., you can do a whole page for 1 member, or write messages for 2-7 members and she will cut each message out and put it in an envelope with everyone else's messages).

The album ordering and extras will go on until she runs out, but if you want to send a message to the members, **she must receive your order, payment, and letter by October 13th, 12pm KST.**

**Korean Releases**

* Got It? - I Like You and Like Oh (I really tried to pick only one, but I just couldn't)
* Got Love - Forever Young
* Identify - Magnetic
* Just Right - Nice
* Mad+Mad Winter Edition - If You Do
* Flight Log: Departure - Can't
* Flight Log: Turbulence - Who's That

**Japanese Releases**

* Yo Moriagatteyo - So Lucky, Jibberish (Again, I couldn't pick just one)
* Hey Yah - Let Me Know

Honorable mentions: A, Moonlight, Gimme, See the Light, and Mayday

I combined the Mad and Mad repackage and I also combined all of the Japanese singles into Yo Moriagatteyo because there were only 3 new songs in the repackage and 2 songs in each Japanese single, but if you would like to separate them, go ahead! There are no strict rules (I definitely cheated by choosing 2 songs for some albums), so just have fun with it and hopefully you'll rediscover some old favorites like I did with Like Oh!

JACKSON DIDN'T LOOK AT ME :( hi-touch tips.,Steffy_love,1485383498,"Let me just say waiting out in the cold for eight hours was worth it. Besides the rude staff, the fan meet was absolutely amazing. Just seeing the boys in the flesh was such a great experience. They were lively and energetic, and we could all tell they were having a good time. After the fan meeting comes time for p1 photos and p2 hi-touch. Myself and my friend had p2 tickets, and we waited for p1 to go first. We wanted to be last in line for the hi-touch, but so many other fans had that idea in mind. The staff was starting to get rude and telling us to go. We just said screw it and went ahead instead of being last. First in line was Jinyoung. OMFG! He looks so majestic in real life. He literally looks like royalty, so I see where the nickname Prince Jinyoung came about. His smile was so big and bright. He had the softest hands that I've ever felt. Next was Youngjae, he is so precious. JB is so handsome in person! Then came Yugyeom! He stared into my soul during hi-touch. Such a bias wrecker. Next came Jackson. I told him to stay healthy and he didn't even look at me :( I wonder why, sigh. Oh well. Maybe next time. Next was Mark and he is so sweet and handsome. Bambam was distracted at the end because someone was talking to him. Some tips for hi-touch would be to try and go as slow as you can even though staff will rush you. Try to be the last fan if you can. I will try to get a photo op next time! ",9,11

Most of the time, I tend to like just a few singles from artists. I rarely ever find myself diving into a K-Pop artist/group's entire discography. The only groups I've loved entire albums from have been 2ne1 and Wonder Girls (imagine my dismay that they both disbanded recently).

I first came across Got7 about 4-5 months ago. Since then I've watched all of their videos on repeat, quite a few live performances, and some other random videos. It wasn't until very recently that I decided to buy one or two of their releases. I started with Got It? and Got Love. Excellent. Then I moved on.

Today, I've finally listened to every Got7 album, EP, and single that I am aware of, including the Japanese releases. Throughout the whole experience, there was never a dull track (okay, I'm not a huge fan of the song Hey Yah). I kept being entirely surprised by just how good all of these songs were. The guys are incredibly talented, and their music has shown a real sense of growth. 

I hope Got7 stays around for a very, very long time.

Just had to gush a bit. I'm now obsessed.",15,11

Are they worth it or not? Also do the vvip tickets give you priority privileges? Oh and one last question ;w; does GOT7's concerts even have vvip tickets?

Those of you who were here last year might have seen the spreadsheet I linked here listing all (at least all I could remember) the shows GOT7 had been part of since debut. However I excluded a lot of shows the boys may have done solo.

With their 'Never Ever' comeback I thought I would post it here again because I'm sure we have new IGOT7s who might want to see what they can watch that the boys have been on.

I stopped updating around November of 2016 because I got busy/lazy but I've hopefully added everything between then and now. If I haven't, it'd be super helpful if you could tell me what I'm missing.

Additionally, there are other tabs on the spreadsheet which explains the colour key and a 'Specials/Cuts' tab which is just extra clips I didn't feel like would fit in the 'Shows' portion but are still fun to watch. This is stuff like VCRs, special variety show clips, etc.

Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XfqnsQSLqjV5U_pRU3wQrdZ3atfAJ4QrF8n9XJEiEzY/edit?usp=sharing

If any links are broken, please DM me either on twitter, discord or reddit! Thank you!

I know for a while this subreddit has gone without an active mod but there are now new ones in place (you can check on the sidebar who the new mods are).

Hopefully we'll be able to clean up the subreddit if things that shouldn't be here (sorry Game of Thrones fans) are posted. It helps if you guys report posts too so it's immediately brought to our attention.

Hopefully we can get this subreddit looking nice and becoming active!

If you have any suggestions or questions, please don't hesitate to comment them or message us.

As a Twice fan, does Got7 have any tv shows that give us a behind the scenes look of their lives as celebrities or shows that show them traveling? 
Twice has a wiki for this stuff https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/wiki/index and it gives us a list of the shows that have been made on twice. Is there anything like that for Got7? 

Any help appreciated.

Last week I started putting GOT7's schedule for the week on the sidebar for anyone who wanted to keep up with all of the teaser releases for JJ Project's Verse 2. (Not sure how many people noticed though, since I just did it on a whim.) I planned to update it every Sunday (EST/EDT) with the coming week's activities, but I realized when updating it this week that it might be good to archive each week. Unfortunately I already lost last week's, but from now on, I was thinking I would make it a stickied post each Sunday with the next week's schedule. This way, not only is it more visible, but also people can talk about it and also let me know if I miss anything.

Let me know what you guys think about this, and if you have any problems or suggestions for improvement. I'll leave the schedules in the sidebar too for anyone who wants a quick reference.

Without further ado, here is GOT7's schedule for next week.

Let's liven this place up with multiple banners like /r/Kpop ! I'm thinking of having a total of 9 banners, 1 for the whole team, 7 for each individual, and 1 for JJProject. But don't be limited by my suggestion and feel free to post less than 9 banners, or other styles of banners that you like. 

The pictures should be

- High-def

- Width should be at least 1366 px or bigger

- For the height.. around 300 px, I'll let you guys decide, but it must be the same for all of your banners.

- Specify which banner is the main banner that would be shown to first time guests/non-redditors.

The winner will be the one with the most upvotes, so have fun!

I became a GOT7 fan during Fly era, and although I was (and am) excited about the fandom and sales growing with each release after that, I also started getting back into other groups and following k-pop in general more closely. That meant being exposed to all the opinions non-fans have about GOT7's music. 

**Sometimes I question my own musical taste:** given that I love or grew to like most of GOT7's title tracks. In some of their songs, there are parts that I find could have been rapped better, sung better or needed better lyric flow, but nothing that makes me think they are terrible. And yet, if you go look at any discussion being held by people who aren't ahgase, there's people who hate it, people who think it's ok, and rarely people who really liked the songs...

I often feel very frustrated as a fan because people already have a negative view on them and no matter how good the song is they will keep being negative. Even non-fans who like the song, they'll spend 1 minute praising the new song and 20 talking about how the previous albums were so bad. This makes me **discouraged to speak freely about what I really thought of the songs**, because I don't want to add to the negativity.

And I guess finally, **it makes me scared** for their future, I keep being afraid we have reached our fandom peak, of not having anyone else interested in giving GOT7 a try because they just assume they aren't talented....

I really love them and want them to succeed, but sometimes I feel really stressed about not being able to help them grow (which is why I'm now trying to liven up this community)

So, anyone else feels the same?

I live in Canada so if it's online they will need to ship here. Also, I am flying to Hong Kong and will also be in Japan in the next couple weeks, if that helps. Not sure if they're sold in physical stores at all.

This schedule was compiled based on a combination of GOT7's official schedule, the calendar documented by AHGAWINGS, and my own tracking from official sources. If I've made a mistake, missed anything, or if anything comes up during the week, let me know and I'll make updates!",0,3

28,2018-1-16,2018,1,16,9,7qo7ou,Happy GOT7 4th Anniversary + New Theme!,valvietd,1516060804,"##Hello fellow Ahgases :)

Happy 4th Anniversary! Today in Korea it is again the same day where 4 years ago, these 7 guys we adore were introduced officially to the world and debuted as GOT7. 

Last year I decided that I wanted to do something for the community and, as an ahgase who happens to be a graphic designer (or a graphic designer who happens to be an ahgase most of the time :P), I couldnt think of a better way than doing something that puts my own abilities to use. 

And now I bring to you the result of a couple of months of hard work: a new customized theme, especially for this subreddit and for GOT7! With this theme, I hope to *bring in more fans to engage* with the community, and also *inspire everyone to collaborate* so that this place can become an **active and resourceful place for all Ahgases**.

#NEW FEATURES

##HEADER    
* The header is a living thing now! On the top right you can find links to Official GOT7 accounts in some of the most used SNS platforms. On the top left you can play around with the logos and see what happens ; )

##USER FLAIRS    
* The other mods and I agreed that GOToons would make adorable user flairs! And so, on the side bar you can now pick one of the seven members or the got7 logo, and write your own text: it will appear when the mouse hovers over the flair. We might include more in the future and make polls to decide what you want to see, but it should be adorableness enough for now :D

## MENU BAR    
* Now we have a Menu that is on top of every page, you can find useful links there and more things will come in the future!

&amp;nbsp;    

# WHAT IS COMING IN THE FUTURE

## COMMUNITY RULES AND UPDATES    
* We want the sub to be better organized, more active and to be an useful place for future reference and search. For this reason, the other mods and I are working on re-writing the rules, title formatting and flair system. 

## SEARCH BY FLAIR
* In the future, youll have easy access to searches that automatically filter everything under a flair, so all youll need to worry about is picking the keywords :)

&amp;nbsp;    

These changes and the things coming in the future are just our own ideas and work, but this community wouldn't exist without the readers and subscribers. **If you have any ideas about how we can improve, or even if you want to help somehow.** Maybe you like to write and want to help with wiki pages, or maybe you already have a list of JJ Project book recommendations and arent sure how to post? Maybe you're not sure if you should post anything at all?! Feel always free to message the mod team and well help you out (or maybe youll help us!)

&amp;nbsp;    

I don't want this to be too long, so that's everything for now!     
Thank you for being here! And hope you'll have a great week :)

We welcome this new comeback with a new theme! :) I won't make this too long because in a few minutes we're gonna be terribly busy listening to the new album! A few announcements:

# RULES PAGE

The rules page has been updated accordingly to the guidelines we mods have been following when posting and (very rarely) deleting comments. We hope everyone will read and follow those as well, and that posting will be less confusing for those who wish to contribute now! In the future we'll also be adding a Flair guideline wiki, but since flairs can be changed, don't feel too pressured about it!

# SEARCH BY FLAIR

The new theme has a quick search filter feature to help you find stuff faster! On the menu bar you can find some quick links under ""search by flair"", they'll redirect you to a search page that already filters things by date and flair. All you need to do is add any words you would like to search for, or browse the results! If it doesn't work properly, just delete any '+' from the search input field or open it on a new tab.

That's it! Happy Comeback Week everyone!",3,7

So I picked up some nice blank shirts from Uniqlo today and I've been thinking about putting some subtle Got7 meme references on them. But I can't decide on [which to do](https://imgur.com/a/YoCMR6E). These would be for personal use but I'd love to hear input/suggestions!

Right now I have   

- ""Dandelonie"" as fake Supreme shirt.  

- ""Chu Chu Chu Chuuuuuuu"" in Black on white  

- ""Chu Chu Chu Chuuuuuuu"" in white on white (I really love doing monochrome designs, the materials I use have a slight shine against matte t-shirts that looks luxe)  

- The last one is lyrics from Thank You, one of my current fav Got7 songs. I will for sure do this one but in black on black. The back will have the continuation of the line ""So I'm so sorry"" but offset.

  
So yeah, dandelonie or chu chu chuuu? Or is there another great Got7 moment I should design for? What's your favorite meme?",2,4

The hi touch blew me away because I did not have any preparation, it was so sudden. The order was Mark, Jinyoung, JB, Youngjae, Jackson, Bambam, Yugyeom. The most memorable ones for me were Jackson who grabbed my hand ahshdhdh, JB who said the cutest hellooo~ ever and Yugyeom who gave me the cutest smile ever. I am so happy I can remember the moment I had with all!!

Now, for the organization, we had to get a wristband at noon to get a number. Then we had to comeback at 3 to get in line for the hi touch. We were dying in the heat for 2 hours before we got into the venue. After the hi touch we had to sit at our spots in the pit to create space, everyone was pushing regardless though. I dont think it was a good decision to not have a barrier between VIP and A :( It was so crowded that a lot of people fainted.

However, I went with it and screamed my lungs out every song. During Paradise I got Jackson to notice me again, we made eye contact and I blew him a kiss!! They put up an amazing show even though it was so hot. Cant wait till they are back!!",9,20

My SO and I were lucky enough to get tickets for GOT7s LA show and were wondering whether or not we needed to arrive at the venue earlier to grab any merch before they run out. We know that doors open for specific sections at certain times, but do they have a line/area for merch that opens before people are allowed in?

To anyone who was lucky enough to get the tickets to their Toronto show or to anyone who knows how they run the merch tables, any and all help/info is much appreciated!

One of my friends who is obsessed with Got7 invited me to go to their concert in Barclays on July 11.  (Keep in mind, she told me four days before the actual concert and only invited me because her ahgase friend couldn't make it). I am also into k-pop boy groups and I am familiar with many of Got7's title songs and the members as well but I still feel that I'm not really prepared because this is my *first* k-pop concert. The seats are not that spectacular but I'm not worried about that. I don't know any fan-chants and I haven't heard most of their songs nor do I have a light stick. I want to go to support her and Got7 and not to waste an opportunity like this since I know that they may be rare. 

Should I still go and if so, what else should I know so that I can kind of ""fit"" in?

Please help me by offering what you would do in my shoes.

Thank you

(p.s. i'm sorry if i sound a bit selfish but please understand the circumstances)",8,12

Do you think theyll run out? *HOW MUCH DO THEY COST?* Do they sell the batteries as well/Are they included? They ARE official RIGHT? 

2 - Are go-pros allowed?

3 - Are you allowed to bring digital cameras (professional looking ones?)

4 - Is it true that some songs on their concert soundtrack dont have a fan-chant? (ie. paradise, skyway, out etc.) 

^ extended: currently trying to cram fan-chants into my brain because Im nervous about this concert I was invited to, dont really know got7 but Ive been doing my best to learn as much as I can before I go! The track list is 25 songs, but it seems like some of them dont have fan-chants?

Since GOT7's 3rd (full) album is coming soon, I really want to help them top the charts for this come back. As the charts are a combination of online streaming and offline sales, I'm willing to help us overseas ahgase who have trouble to getting a melon account for streaming. My idea is to collect funds and buy as much as possible melon accounts, then distribute them to whoever have time to stream (there are plenty tutorials about how to stream); however it might not be the best idea since there are many issues that come along. 

Also I know that all the Chinese fan sites have opened the link to collect funds for ''non-return albums'', as you will only receive the photo cards instead of the album. It's the solution for topping the sales while you don't get an overload of the same album and have no storage place. But I haven't seen something similar overseas. 

What do you guys think? ( I don't know if it's appropriate to post like this. If not, please let me know) And comment below and let me know what do you think:) &lt;3 love&amp;peace",3,10

I'm kinda a new fan (substantiated by the fact that I don't know the fan name lol) to Got7 and I was wondering if there are any reality type shows to get to know them better. I remember when I first got into k-pop a couple years ago (snsd was my first group), I would watch the episodes of reality shows that they were on like running man and hello baby (can't think of anymore examples off the top of my head but there were like a few more that I have seen I'm pretty sure. And to add on, I've also watched stuff like (I'm sorry I don't know the names of it... but also brackets inside of brackets damn I'm a mess lol) where some groups went on like vacations or whatever like seventeen and gfriend).

 Anyways I was just wondering if there was anything like that I could watch or like any other reccomendations or whatever. Sorry for my super incoherent paragraphs and also if this post is like kinda weird or something. I'm like in that phase where I'm weirdly obsessed with them I want to watch something with them in it. I've seen like edits of clips and stuff on youtube but like I'm not sure where to start really. Any help would be great, thankss. ",12,14

Recently two of my fellow Ahgase friends and I made a GOT7 Discord server for fans to meet, chat and chill out. We are currently small but very friendly, and we welcome everyone! \*\*Click here if you would like to join: [https://discord.gg/Gr37D3t](https://discord.gg/Gr37D3t).\*\* Lets chat about the comeback (dropping in less than 2 days ahhh)!!

In case youre not familiar with Discord, its an app for text and voice chatting. It allows ppl to easily share photos, videos, gifs, etc.

In our server we have:

* a bot that notifies us whenever GOT7s vlive, youtube, and insta accounts update
* a music bot
* self-assignable bias roles
* individual member channels
* a memes channel

P.S. If you're wondering who drew the fanart here, it was one of my friends who started the server with me!

It's that time again, with this comeback there might be a few people wanting to get into GOT7 or maybe you're already a fan who just wants a list of stuff GOT7 has been on!

I've compiled a masterlist of GOT7s appearances! I do believe I'm missing some but I continually work and update the list to make sure it's up to date and fill in missing appearances!

If you ever do find something wrong or something I'm missing in the list I'd really appreciate you messaging me about it!

This masterlist can also be found on the top bar of this subreddit under, 'Variety Shows'.

Here's the masterlist link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XfqnsQSLqjV5U_pRU3wQrdZ3atfAJ4QrF8n9XJEiEzY/edit?usp=sharing

I know they have a lot of fame internationally but I was reading some old NetizenBuzz translations under the GOT7 tag and looking at things dated back to their earlier eras, it seems like they were heavily neglected by JYPE, who knows if it's because of funding or mismanagement..

Their musicality seems to be improving drastically, although EOY as an album was a bit of a lull for me in their post FL trilogy, and to be honest, their older titles are really great too. GOT7 work really hard all the time but I think their promotion cycle is really focused on international circuits, even with the rumors of 2019 world tour, Japan promos, etc and it reminds me of 2PM post their peak as an idol group where they were in Japan more than they were in Korea. The problem with this is that GOT7 haven't hit their peak in Korea yet. I don't know, I really wish they had time to focus on promoting in Korea but I guess the company does not want to miss out on this wave of international success. 

They really, really have a lot of talent. I wonder what and when they will get that final push and what exactly is missing.

listening to lullaby with good headphones is honestly an experience. there are so many sounds you dont hear the first, second, or even fifteenth time around like me. the bass that you can hear in the beginning really sets a dreamy mood that you can feel even if you didn't watch the mv. i cant really explain the sort of out of world feeling you get when listening, like nothing in the world exists except you and got7.

the next track that really stood out to me was I Am Me. honestly my favorite non title track by them and i really love the choreography too. it is so detailed and you can really tell they didnt cheap out or get lazy on the non title tracks. you can feel the raw emotion that each member is trying to convey and the mood that the producers set. 

fine by yuggie is the last one i will review because im short on time and i hate writing lol. it continues to be the best solo on the album (shoutout to jb tho, sunrise was a hit) and also has the best mv. yugyeom really showed his dancing ability with his self made choreography and lyrics. ill be honest, i really wasnt expecting much because we dont often get to see his artistic side, but man he fucking blew me away. the beat drop is amazing and can get me out of any mood, the tone he uses throughout the song exerts the frustrated feeling he gets when talking to the girl (read the lyrics) and the swaying beat (only way i can explain it) just makes you feel uneasy. fuck, that song is so good.

anyway thats my review bye ",6,1

Two of my fellow Ahgase friends &amp; I made a GOT7 Discord server for fans to meet, chat, and chill. Were very friendly, and we welcome everyone. [Click here](http://discord.gg/Gr37D3t) **if you want to join.**Lets chat (or scream) about the MV and album that just dropped (OMG)!

This M/V made me cry. Beautiful song and lyrics. I think the little girl had a terminal disease and that was the reason why she can't go outside. GOT7 were her guardian angels (the reason why we, including the girl, can't see them at first but she saw them in the end when she reached the top) helping her soul go to heaven. At least, that's what I got from the ending scene. If we want to think positive, it would be just a little girl sleeping and I hope that's what happened instead of my theory. It gave me little match girl vibes though.

My question is, what types of things should I learn about them? What are the members known for? What shows have they been on? What are the inside jokes? Any information about the group is appreciated, no matter how general or specific it is!",9,1

73,2018-12-19,2018,12,19,23,a7n033,Anyone wanna buy GOT7 arrival and turbulence albums from me? (Never and ever versions both available),bluekatt24,1545230678,"When got7 released there Arrival album I bought both the Never + Ever versions I got both posters (rolled) but I never took the posters out or used the album's at all I did open them to look inside and fangirl over the photos but I'm not the type that likes to put things on display so everything has been sitting in the boxes as if I never opened it. And to be honest I have no use for them. They're just sitting there uselessly in my book shelf and tight now I need the money so I thought why not sell them? 

For the Arrival Album:

I saw that on Amazon the ""Ever"" version was being sold for $39.90 (without poster) apparently the Never version is sold out or no one is selling it? Either way I was thinking of selling each album (with their poster) between $30-$35 because I did open them.  

For the Turbulence Album:
 Found it at Amazon for about $35 and on Barnes and noble for about $25 (not sure). I also own this along with its poster (rolled not folded). It has been opened, stickers have been used. Because of the fact it's been opened and the stickers have been used, I am willing to sell from between $13-$20.

I will try to ship from cheapest package delivery so I would also appreciate delivery fee (I will do a bit of research for fees and discuss that with you) 

If interested please DM me. I do have photos of everything if you would like proof that it's all in good condition.

I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Japan for my birthday! It just so happens that Got7 is also holding a concert at Kobe World Hall nearby. I am thinking of purchasing my tickets either from viagogo or stubhub. The tickets on both website say reserved which I am assuming is just a seat.

Which would be a safer choice?

Also how long before the concert should I line up?

Are there any other tips and advice you can give me?

What kind of things should I bring?

Thank you so much in advance! ",4,1

The paper was for Business Communication (I study Communication in Italy), and it follows the stakeholder relationship management methodology.

I'd love to have any feedback really! If you see mistakes in english it's because it's not my first language and I've never really studied how to write in academic english, tbh this was my first paper ever!

Hi! Here is a new discord server for Korean learners. It was designed to communicate, share information, and provide lectures among Korean learners.

There are currently a total of 764 members on this server. Five of them are native Korean speakers and can help you learn Korean.

 We provide lectures to help basic Korean learners (listening, grammar, and speaking, words.. etc)

Even if you are not a Korean learner, if you are interested in Korea(K-culture) or like to chat, please come and have a chat.

To be honest, the K-pop channel in our server is dying. I would appreciate it if you could come to our server and actively save KPOP server.

Tyrion: ""Consider yourself lucky at least your balls aren't freezing off"". Really two of the most intelligent counsels are going to Witerfell and they are talking about balls. No planning how to convince the houses of Winterfell to join them or no discussion of the fucking night king and his army who is coming for them. No counseling Daenerys or Jon what to say when the lords say fuck themself. (which they did). Just balls.

Gathering in the Castle Black. The moment where clever Tyrion, wise Varys, silver-tongued Davos should show all their diplomatic skills to show the houses of Winterfell that they have only one option. The moment for a speach that makes the lords shit themselves. Persuade them that Deanerys was their only option against the night king, his zombe dragon and millions of walkers. 

Deanerys and Jon fly the dragens and the first thing they do is reconiassance of the night king, Deanerys sees her died child from far distance. John examines the magnitude of the zombe army and its location.  Nooo. They go to a beautiful waterfall and make out like in a fucking indian movie.

So I really want to go to one of the concert for this world tour and the closest one for me is Australia (I live in NZ). However, I also want to take my lil sister with me, but she lives in Indonesia. 
So I kind of thinking of taking the risk to wait, in case they decide to add Singapore or Malaysia or Thailand, or even Jakarta for this world tour and just go there since it's most likely gonna be cheaper. Also, I feel like the probability of them not going to Thailand (at least) is pretty low. 
What do you guys think? We could both go to Australia, its not a problem, but if we could minimise the expense, then why not.

It'd be a shame to have an empty seat on the floor. The seat is pretty close to the extended stage!  
Unfortunately, because its a VIP ticket, its will call. You'd have to meet us before the show to grab the ticket and VIP package that comes with it. If you'd like more proof about us or the ticket, don't hesitate to ask.

126,2019-6-30,2019,6,30,1,c70y2a,GOT7 Newark Concert Tips and Experience!,sailor-wallflower,1561824856,"Hi everyone!

So I went to the GOT7 concert in Newark and it was AMAZING!!! The boys were so incredible live! Their setlist was so good and I love how they took time to talk with us and have fun with us! But I've seen a lot of people asking about things about the concert so I thought I would tell you guys about my experience with merch and the venue.

1. The Merch

So yeah, the merch variety was really limited and the shirt designs were kinda meh. But they had PLENTY of shirts in all sizes, so don't worry about them selling out! I got there at 5:00pm (doors opened at 6:30pm) and the merch line wasn't long at all, I waited like 7-10 minutes in line. We thought for a second that they sold out of lightsticks but this awesome staff member brought two more boxes full of lightsticks, so don't worry about them selling out since they seem to have a lot of them in stock! Also side note, they didn't sell the button set. I heard from a staff member that the shipment of button sets never arrived so beware that they may not sell the button set at your concert!

2. The Venue

At the Newark venue (Prudential Center) they had a lot of rules. Of course, rules vary from each venue but Prudential Center really sucked at telling us the rules. These things may not apply to your concert venue but I just want to warn you guys if your venue doesn't clearly tell you the rules like Prudential Center. First, it took a LONG time to get through security. We only had about 15 people in front of us and it took us 35 minutes to get through security (just walking though the metal detector and having someone check out bags.) Speaking of bags, I highly suggest taking a small bag. I called Pru Center ahead of time asking if they had a bag policy and they said no. However, once we got there, they checked our bag size and we could only have a certain size. I feel so bad for the people with larger bags, they had to leave the line and figure out what to do. The security was really rude, I made my friend and I fans with large popsicle sticks to hold them and they said it wasn't allowed (even though I never saw it anywhere online.) We had to break the sticks and just kept the fan part which doesn't make sense since it was more dangerous now since the sticks didn't break evenly so we had a fan with a sharp ending lol. Also, no signs of any size were allowed (even though online it said signs were allowed) so the fans with signs had to leave them in a big pile outside. Just want to warn you guys in advance to throughly read your venue's rules and maybe call ahead of time if you have any questions at all!

&amp;#x200B;

3. The Concert

One word: AMAZING!!! GOT7 are just such a talented and awesome group! I think the most important thing is to have fun and don't worry about what other people think. My friend is a huge Yugyeom fan and every time he sang, we screamed and cheered for him. The people in front of us kept looking back at us and rolling their eyes. My friend was a little embarrassed at first, but I told them not to worry about it and to have fun and we did! If you have a problem with people cheering for their favorite boy, maybe you shouldn't go to their concert lol. Also, be aware if you're taking an Uber/Lyft to leave the concert, it's going to be expensive. Me and my friend walked about 5 minutes away from the venue to get an Uber and it was a lot cheaper so if you can, I recommend leaving the crowded venue to a less crowded area if you can! 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically just be aware of your venue's rules, they're pretty strict about things! And don't worry about them running out of merch, just get their a bit early if you can! And make sure to have fun no matter what other's may think! I hope this helped and I hope that every IGOT7 that goes to see them has a wonderful and fun time like we did! \^\^",32,55

Their performance was incredible, their stage prescience, their moves, their everything was perfect. I don't want to talk too much about details in case you want to have some surprises.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things:

\-the was a booth open before the concert that was selling merch and lightsticks. Kinda felt silly buying a VIP ticket with ""exclusive shopping access"" when there was already a place to buy stuff, but it was nice getting in early.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Goody bad is nice. You get a bag, the album book, two photocards, the poster, and a set of photos with signatures. Not a crazy awesome vip experience but I guess I was really paying for the seat.

&amp;#x200B;

\-This is probably somewhere else, but I wanted to bring it to peoples attention again if they are also going to concerts. The ver. 2 lightstick wont stay on. you either have to repeatedly push the button and switch between flashing modes or do self-mode for it to stay on. Kind of a pain, since they are so expensive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, an awesome experience and I can't wait for next year (which they brought up so they better come back :P)",9,14

Ive been looking forward to seeing GOT7 for a whole year now. But it seems like ever since the tour dates were FINALLY released (a day Ive been nervous about and stressing over for MONTHS), I just see so many news bad news about GOT7 and so many people trying to make GOT7 look bad. I know GOT7 always seemed to be butt of the joke to a lot of people for some reason... but it seemed that the negativity has quite literally quadrupled ever since the start of this era. 

And its so upsetting to see when were all already struggling with other piling issues we have with this current era.... kpop stan twt likes to push us further in to the ground. Its like everyones against us in our happiness. 

Trust me, I usually dont get stupid petty stuff like Twitter or rumors get to me.... but after today (which I will NOT elaborate on because it turned out to be the stupidest fake news Ive ever seen on that bird app), it showed how scary false rumors can EASILY destroy the image of the group ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE HELP OF THEIR OWN COMPANY. And thats kind of where my patience was tipped over the edge. 

They truly see GOT7 and us Ahgases as jokes. And some would say to just delete twitter if you dont wanna see drama, but unfortunately, as much as I hate twitter, that is the place where I get my concert updates and just updates in general about GOT7. And regardless of who I follow, mention of drama always tend to slide into my news feed for some reason and its irritating. Like, Im really in Middle school again where Im just trying to enjoy being an Ahgase, but people that have nothing to do with me keep trying to take that happiness away. LIKE DAMN, why cant yall just leave us alone? Were already irritated with JYP and are just trying to enjoy this questionably promoted concert. 

But anyways, Im really not trying to start anything negative here (seriously), but Im sure a lot of us on here are feeling the same way. I just feel like Im so out of control with everything bad that happens to GOT7. And I just want to have my 3 hours with my boys to be a good one later tonight at the concert. 

This was kind of all over the place, but basically; Im tired of little kids with access to Twitter thinking theyre accomplishing something by posting a stupid fancam along with a hateful comment about GOT7. I wish I was a naive Ahgase again where I wasnt caught up with any scandals and just solely watched funmy videos on YouTube. NOPE, apparently, I have to be pulled into this middle school drama mess like, ew. Grow up, please?

Anyways, Ill try to keep my spirits high for this Dallas concert. Because Ive wanted this for so long, Im not gonna let 13 year olds on some stupid app try to ruin that moment for me. Thanks for reading... if anyone even did. I will delete this later if many of you feel that I should.",16,60

I'm looking for some advice on which tickets I should aim for to have the best view and experience there.

Background: An idiot that's never bought tickets online before

* If you're buying tickets online and the system kicks you out - DON'T PANIC. Servers are probably flooded with people logging on 
* Only have ONE TAB of the website open. Pretty sure they track your IP address or something. Keep it open and don't refresh!
   *  If you want to increase your chances, have a friend log on in your separate homes
   * PRO-TIP if you have a phone with data, that's another entry!
* When you finally do get through, you will have a set time to make the purchase (mine was about 10 minutes)
   * PRO-TIP Every time you put your credit card in, it extends the time!! (I kept doing this because I was on phone with my bank to... see next point)
* **CHECK WITH YOUR BANK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WON'T BLOCK FOREIGN PURCHASES**
   * My purchase got blocked 3 times. I was so annoyed I was on the verge of tears. One quick phone call explaining the situation, confirming the amounts in foreign currency and my local currency, and we were good to go. In hindsight, I really should have done this before. 
* This whole ordeal took me 1.5 hours. So, yeah. A good time last night.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is just specific to the HK ticketing website, but I hope it helps others out! I am stoked I am getting to go to GOT7! :))",2,29

Enjoyed all their content, watched all the videos, etc. Kept it up for a while but my interest in kpop started winding down and GOT7 ended up being one of the first groups I dropped, the last thing I remember kinda enjoying was 'Just Right' because by the time 'If you do' came out I was completely disinterested.

I never truly dropped kpop 100% but pretty much haven't been part of a fandom in 3 years. But about a month ago one of GOT7's recent American interviews came up on my youtube recommended, I watched it and felt nostalgic so I dug up a few more videos. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA because now im hardcore slipping back into being a fan again after essentially 4 years of ignorance...regrets

So I'm looking to see if anyone can help me with like, a GOT7 sparknotes version. They have so much content and I feel overwhelmed just looking at their vlive page, I've already watched both hard carry series and the jeju miniseries but have no idea what to watch next. Are there any core moments/varieties that I should watch? Anything I should know as a (sort-of) new fan? Memes? Lol

My bias is and has always been Jinyoung (weird to call him that now bc he's still Jr. to me in my head lmao) but now also Jackson, surprisingly, as I didn't like him much before. But I still like all other members too, any help is gratefully appreciated ;;",2,10

The song that will 200% make me cry whenever I hear it is 'I Am Me' (I am not even joking, the waterworks start almost immediately), mainly because it was released at a particular juncture in my life where I am was going through some exciting but scary life changes. I listen to it every time to remind myself to be brave and live the life I've always wanted to live. Special thanks to Jinyoung for those fantastic lyrics. 

Coming in a close second is 'Miracle', there is something about Yugyeom's high note that punches me in the gut every time! And also because it is generally a warm and fuzzy song.

Im pretty sure Marks family is from Taiwan but Mark himself is from LA. Jackson is obviously from China (Hong Kong) but they speak Cantonese in HK so does his Mandarin have a Cantonese accent? Jackson says he is only alright but I feel hes just being humble (because he is!) His Cantonese is obviously perfect and my mom can confirm because she is Cantonese and shes seen of Jacksons HK interviews. Thanks guys!  ,3,22

I'm planning on going to the London concert on the 11th of October, however, I'd be flying from Hungary and I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands because of that. WizzAir is offering really cheap flight prices to London right now, and I don't know how long those offers are going to last, but I'm afraid that they will get much more expensive by next Wednesday, when ticket sales are on. Normally I would wait until I have my concert tickets to book a flight, but I couldn't afford to spend double on flight tickets, as the concert tickets themselves already turned out to be more expensive than I anticipated (I'm still a student and only work part-time). Also, I have used AXS before and I absolutely hated it, and I'm scared that I might not get tickets after all, so even getting the cheap flight would be money thrown out the window.

What would you do in my place? Should I book the flight regardless? Do you think I can definitely get tickets? I mean, I could even get BTS tickets this year (to Paris, though), but I'm still undecisive. I don't know how big the GOT7 London fanbase is, plus as far as I know this will be their first time in London. I'm sorry if this is a stupid post, but I really don't know who to ask :(",8,10

TAKE A BOW fansite had a cute cup sleeve event for Jinyoungs birthday this weekend! The whole cafe was decked out in photos of Jinyoung taken by TAB, and it was such a cute little gallery style mini exhibition. 

On all the drinks, you had the option to pick a photo of Jinyoung that they printed directly on the foam top of the drink!! I chose the one of him with the puppy :) They also had printed macarons with art from @abimabima and those were sooo cute as well! 

In a small room inside the cafe, TAB had a whole set up of their past photobooks of Jinyoung for fans to flip through, as well as cute little merch items theyve made in the past! Theres a screen in the room and they were playing a really sweet video they made; part of it was a really cute song over some clips of Jinyoung smiling and waving at fans, and then the rest was a really lovely compilation of fancams of their performances from every single era in order starting at JJ Project (my heart!! ) all the way up to the Hey Guys fansign that was last weekend.

It was such a cute experience and there are a lot of cute gifts the fansite prepared like a beautiful handfan, photo cards, stickers, and a pamphlet!! 

Thats all! In case anyone biases Jinyoung but couldnt be here, I wanted to post some photos and the experience for you all to read ^^

I really hope it's ok for me to post this here - please tell me to go away if not! 

I am doing an MA in Arts &amp; Cultural Enterprise as part of my course, I have to create a prototype for a product or service that I would like to create IRL. I am a massive K-pop fan, and have been working on a social network specifically for bringing K-pop fans together across the UK, so they can find friends to go to shows with :)

I wish I had the budget to make it real, but alas I do not! But for the sake of this project, I have created a Discord server to demonstrate to my tutor how it could potentially work. There is a different channel for each upcoming K-pop show in the UK, and the idea is that people could join the server and get to know fellow concert attendees in the appropriate channel.

If this is of interest to you, you can access the Discord here: [https://discord.gg/UGUnwdv](https://discord.gg/UGUnwdv)

You will see a channel set up for the Day6 London show. It's pretty empty at the moment, but it would be wonderful if even just a couple of peeps joined so I can show my tutor how this idea would work!

Thank you so much for your time, and have a wonderful day!",0,1

73,2019-11-9,2019,11,9,6,dtm68v,GOT7 Comeback Unpopular Opinions!,lobstermoon,1573248637,"- I think we are actually doing really well with the title track this time round with the 'general public'. Here are my unreliable anecdotal evidence: 
1. I personally know of two non-fans who were willing to give it a 2nd listen after I shoved the song in their faces. Never happened before and I have been consistently doing that for each comeback since Look lol. 
2. There are quite a few GOT7 related posts in the Unpopular Kpop Opinions reddit which I frequent. Those may not be positive opinions BUT it shows that people are talking about GOT7 right now and again, never happens during comeback season. 
3. I have read comments like, 'this is my favourite song after If You Do/Just Right' and that is a big compliment from the general public (I don't get the immense love for both songs by non-fans BUT it means this title track hit the spot for them and that is so important to gain public attention.)

-It just shows that the best marketing that JYP can do for GOT7 is to just give them a solid public friendly track rather than the media appearances that fans constantly ask for? Idk... 

- Did they change the stylist this comeback because honestly, the outfits for all the stages look bad. Who's missing the beautiful Miracle and Lullaby era outfits because those were soooo good.",23,1
