I purchased a ticket to see GOT7 in Toronto tonight, but I am unable to go. It's a P2 floor ticket. Attached is a screenshot of said ticket information. 

I don't want it to go to waste, so hopefully there is an Ahgase who can go with such short notice. If anyone is interested, I will send a screenshot of the QR code to your inbox. &lt;3 No exchange of personal info necessary.

My friend and I want to travel to Korea sometime for a Got7 fanmeet or concert, so it'd be ideal for us to have the gold fanclub membership to be able to access tickets for those events. I know people who are in Korea who would be willing to help me get it (friends who are there for the summer and would bring it back to the US for me). Does anyone know if this would be possible? I feel like maybe there's something in place to prevent this from working, but I don't know enough about it to know for sure. Thanks!",3,11

My SO and I were lucky enough to get tickets for GOT7s LA show and were wondering whether or not we needed to arrive at the venue earlier to grab any merch before they run out. We know that doors open for specific sections at certain times, but do they have a line/area for merch that opens before people are allowed in?

To anyone who was lucky enough to get the tickets to their Toronto show or to anyone who knows how they run the merch tables, any and all help/info is much appreciated!

One of my friends who is obsessed with Got7 invited me to go to their concert in Barclays on July 11.  (Keep in mind, she told me four days before the actual concert and only invited me because her ahgase friend couldn't make it). I am also into k-pop boy groups and I am familiar with many of Got7's title songs and the members as well but I still feel that I'm not really prepared because this is my *first* k-pop concert. The seats are not that spectacular but I'm not worried about that. I don't know any fan-chants and I haven't heard most of their songs nor do I have a light stick. I want to go to support her and Got7 and not to waste an opportunity like this since I know that they may be rare. 

Should I still go and if so, what else should I know so that I can kind of ""fit"" in?

Please help me by offering what you would do in my shoes.

Thank you

(p.s. i'm sorry if i sound a bit selfish but please understand the circumstances)",8,12
21,2018-7-10,2018,7,10,4,8xewol,Questions I have pertaining to the GOT7 concert on the 11th.,Byunggon,1531162896,"1 - Will light sticks be selling there? 
Do you think theyll run out? *HOW MUCH DO THEY COST?* Do they sell the batteries as well/Are they included? They ARE official RIGHT? 

2 - Are go-pros allowed?

3 - Are you allowed to bring digital cameras (professional looking ones?)

4 - Is it true that some songs on their concert soundtrack dont have a fan-chant? (ie. paradise, skyway, out etc.) 

^ extended: currently trying to cram fan-chants into my brain because Im nervous about this concert I was invited to, dont really know got7 but Ive been doing my best to learn as much as I can before I go! The track list is 25 songs, but it seems like some of them dont have fan-chants?
