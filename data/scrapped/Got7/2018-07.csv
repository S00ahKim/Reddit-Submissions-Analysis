One of my friends who is obsessed with Got7 invited me to go to their concert in Barclays on July 11.  (Keep in mind, she told me four days before the actual concert and only invited me because her ahgase friend couldn't make it). I am also into k-pop boy groups and I am familiar with many of Got7's title songs and the members as well but I still feel that I'm not really prepared because this is my *first* k-pop concert. The seats are not that spectacular but I'm not worried about that. I don't know any fan-chants and I haven't heard most of their songs nor do I have a light stick. I want to go to support her and Got7 and not to waste an opportunity like this since I know that they may be rare. 

Should I still go and if so, what else should I know so that I can kind of ""fit"" in?

Please help me by offering what you would do in my shoes.

Thank you

4 - Is it true that some songs on their concert soundtrack dont have a fan-chant? (ie. paradise, skyway, out etc.)
