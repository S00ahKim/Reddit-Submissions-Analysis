I hope it will become useful. I'll do my best to keep it as up-to-date as possible.

I am certain I have the majority of shows they have been on, on the spreadsheet already. However I know I am missing a few shows. It'd be awesome if any of you could tell me what I'm missing and I'll be sure to add it.

There is also a 'Special/Cuts' tab for other fun little things(Concert/fanmeet VCRs, small variety cuts). Just give me suggestions what to put there and I'll add it!

I've listed their shows according to their release dates ~~(apart from GOT2DAY S1 and GOT7 Now, as they were originally released on FB and I can't be bothered scrolling back to the 'If You Do' and 'Just Right'eras for accurate release dates).~~

-------
**NOTE:** I have not added every single show each individual member has been on, hence the Jackson masterlist someone had already made off to the side, as I feel like that'd be a bit much. However, if people think it's a good idea to add to the spreadsheet, I will.

Additionally, I have not added their radio shows they've featured on, apart from radio game show cuts in the Special/Cuts tab, due to me not keeping track of all their radio appearances.

 However, if someone does have a list of all the radio shows they've been on, I'd be happy to add it to the spreadsheet.

Albums are 26 USD including shipping worldwide. Albums are opened and you can request a certain member photobook. There are no guarantees though, because she is limited by what she was randomly given, and what people have already claimed. You can also order a copy of the just-released [Urbanlike magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lUrGhHZ2I) featuring JB and Jinyoung for an extra cost (you can contact her for exact details once you make your order).

She is also offering various extras for free, including ""GOT7's It's Skin masks, NBA bromides and posters, and various other GOT7 merch based on the number of albums ordered."" And lastly, she is collecting **messages/letters for the members** to give to them during the fansign. She can only offer each person 1 page because she has to pay for printing, but you can write messages to as many members as you want as long as it fits on that page (i.e., you can do a whole page for 1 member, or write messages for 2-7 members and she will cut each message out and put it in an envelope with everyone else's messages).

The album ordering and extras will go on until she runs out, but if you want to send a message to the members, **she must receive your order, payment, and letter by October 13th, 12pm KST.**
