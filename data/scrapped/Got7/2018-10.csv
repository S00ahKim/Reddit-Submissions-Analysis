I know they have a lot of fame internationally but I was reading some old NetizenBuzz translations under the GOT7 tag and looking at things dated back to their earlier eras, it seems like they were heavily neglected by JYPE, who knows if it's because of funding or mismanagement..

Their musicality seems to be improving drastically, although EOY as an album was a bit of a lull for me in their post FL trilogy, and to be honest, their older titles are really great too. GOT7 work really hard all the time but I think their promotion cycle is really focused on international circuits, even with the rumors of 2019 world tour, Japan promos, etc and it reminds me of 2PM post their peak as an idol group where they were in Japan more than they were in Korea. The problem with this is that GOT7 haven't hit their peak in Korea yet. I don't know, I really wish they had time to focus on promoting in Korea but I guess the company does not want to miss out on this wave of international success. 

They really, really have a lot of talent. I wonder what and when they will get that final push and what exactly is missing.
