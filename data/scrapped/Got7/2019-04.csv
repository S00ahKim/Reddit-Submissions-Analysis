Hi! Here is a new discord server for Korean learners. It was designed to communicate, share information, and provide lectures among Korean learners.

There are currently a total of 764 members on this server. Five of them are native Korean speakers and can help you learn Korean.

 We provide lectures to help basic Korean learners (listening, grammar, and speaking, words.. etc)

Even if you are not a Korean learner, if you are interested in Korea(K-culture) or like to chat, please come and have a chat.

To be honest, the K-pop channel in our server is dying. I would appreciate it if you could come to our server and actively save KPOP server.

It felt very short, and very repetitive, not much variety in the track. But I can definitely see Jackson growing, and will be patient for a track of his that completely blows me away.

Tyrion: ""Consider yourself lucky at least your balls aren't freezing off"". Really two of the most intelligent counsels are going to Witerfell and they are talking about balls. No planning how to convince the houses of Winterfell to join them or no discussion of the fucking night king and his army who is coming for them. No counseling Daenerys or Jon what to say when the lords say fuck themself. (which they did). Just balls.

Gathering in the Castle Black. The moment where clever Tyrion, wise Varys, silver-tongued Davos should show all their diplomatic skills to show the houses of Winterfell that they have only one option. The moment for a speach that makes the lords shit themselves. Persuade them that Deanerys was their only option against the night king, his zombe dragon and millions of walkers. 

Deanerys and Jon fly the dragens and the first thing they do is reconiassance of the night king, Deanerys sees her died child from far distance. John examines the magnitude of the zombe army and its location.  Nooo. They go to a beautiful waterfall and make out like in a fucking indian movie.

PS. 
I absolutely don't have high hope for the rest of the show.",0,1

Let Me is probably one of my favorite songs and it was stuck in my head the other day but my brain kept singing Destiny's Child's Girl. It was like a weird mashup and thats when I realized they sound hella similar! Does anyone else hear it?

&amp;#x200B;

The parts I found are similar is (I think) the melody?
