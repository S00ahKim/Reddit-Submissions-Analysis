3,2019-7-1,2019,7,1,13,c7o7gz,GOT7 in Toronto tips and experience,CoralQuark,1561956033,"First of all: wow. This will easily be one of the best nights of my life. Their performance was incredible, their stage prescience, their moves, their everything was perfect. I don't want to talk too much about details in case you want to have some surprises.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things:

\-the was a booth open before the concert that was selling merch and lightsticks. Kinda felt silly buying a VIP ticket with ""exclusive shopping access"" when there was already a place to buy stuff, but it was nice getting in early.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Goody bad is nice. You get a bag, the album book, two photocards, the poster, and a set of photos with signatures. Not a crazy awesome vip experience but I guess I was really paying for the seat.

&amp;#x200B;

\-This is probably somewhere else, but I wanted to bring it to peoples attention again if they are also going to concerts. The ver. 2 lightstick wont stay on. you either have to repeatedly push the button and switch between flashing modes or do self-mode for it to stay on. Kind of a pain, since they are so expensive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, an awesome experience and I can't wait for next year (which they brought up so they better come back :P)",9,14

Ive been looking forward to seeing GOT7 for a whole year now. But it seems like ever since the tour dates were FINALLY released (a day Ive been nervous about and stressing over for MONTHS), I just see so many news bad news about GOT7 and so many people trying to make GOT7 look bad. I know GOT7 always seemed to be butt of the joke to a lot of people for some reason... but it seemed that the negativity has quite literally quadrupled ever since the start of this era. 

And its so upsetting to see when were all already struggling with other piling issues we have with this current era.... kpop stan twt likes to push us further in to the ground. Its like everyones against us in our happiness. 

Trust me, I usually dont get stupid petty stuff like Twitter or rumors get to me.... but after today (which I will NOT elaborate on because it turned out to be the stupidest fake news Ive ever seen on that bird app), it showed how scary false rumors can EASILY destroy the image of the group ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE HELP OF THEIR OWN COMPANY. And thats kind of where my patience was tipped over the edge. 

They truly see GOT7 and us Ahgases as jokes. And some would say to just delete twitter if you dont wanna see drama, but unfortunately, as much as I hate twitter, that is the place where I get my concert updates and just updates in general about GOT7. And regardless of who I follow, mention of drama always tend to slide into my news feed for some reason and its irritating. Like, Im really in Middle school again where Im just trying to enjoy being an Ahgase, but people that have nothing to do with me keep trying to take that happiness away. LIKE DAMN, why cant yall just leave us alone? Were already irritated with JYP and are just trying to enjoy this questionably promoted concert. 

But anyways, Im really not trying to start anything negative here (seriously), but Im sure a lot of us on here are feeling the same way. I just feel like Im so out of control with everything bad that happens to GOT7. And I just want to have my 3 hours with my boys to be a good one later tonight at the concert. 

This was kind of all over the place, but basically; Im tired of little kids with access to Twitter thinking theyre accomplishing something by posting a stupid fancam along with a hateful comment about GOT7. I wish I was a naive Ahgase again where I wasnt caught up with any scandals and just solely watched funmy videos on YouTube. NOPE, apparently, I have to be pulled into this middle school drama mess like, ew. Grow up, please?

Anyways, Ill try to keep my spirits high for this Dallas concert. Because Ive wanted this for so long, Im not gonna let 13 year olds on some stupid app try to ruin that moment for me. Thanks for reading... if anyone even did. I will delete this later if many of you feel that I should.",16,60

I am planning to go to Got7's HK dates. I am over the moon. I really didn't expect to see them at all - or ever. I have never gone to a concert before. I know the tickets aren't on sale until Jul 15 - but thought I'd come to the group for advice!

* Do you guys prepare with fan chants?
* Is it super necessary to buy light sticks?

Background: An idiot that's never bought tickets online before

* If you're buying tickets online and the system kicks you out - DON'T PANIC. Servers are probably flooded with people logging on 
* Only have ONE TAB of the website open. Pretty sure they track your IP address or something. Keep it open and don't refresh!
   *  If you want to increase your chances, have a friend log on in your separate homes
   * PRO-TIP if you have a phone with data, that's another entry!
* When you finally do get through, you will have a set time to make the purchase (mine was about 10 minutes)
   * PRO-TIP Every time you put your credit card in, it extends the time!! (I kept doing this because I was on phone with my bank to... see next point)
* **CHECK WITH YOUR BANK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WON'T BLOCK FOREIGN PURCHASES**
   * My purchase got blocked 3 times. I was so annoyed I was on the verge of tears. One quick phone call explaining the situation, confirming the amounts in foreign currency and my local currency, and we were good to go. In hindsight, I really should have done this before. 
* This whole ordeal took me 1.5 hours. So, yeah. A good time last night.

Were going to Japan this weekend and it just so happens that GOT7 will also be having their concerts in Japan during that time. Im a recent ahgase, and Ive never been to any of their concerts (plus they didnt have a Manila stop for EOY) and I was thinking maybe I should go and watch their con in Kobe? But I still only know a few of their japanese songs, and I dont know the language that well and Im worried I might not enjoy as much as I want to because of the language barrier. So do the boys perform some of their korean title tracks/songs for their japanese cons? I mean, Id understand if they didnt since Jackson wouldnt be there to cover his parts :(",5,13
