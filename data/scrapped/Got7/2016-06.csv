I haven't watched any yet, but I figured I would let everyone know about it because I have no idea when I'm actually going to get around to watching it myself. (I still haven't even seen all of the V apps from Fly promotions yet. RIP me.) I won't post the rest of these episodes, so whoever is interested can just check KShowOnline periodically.",4,5

16,2016-6-25,2016,6,25,13,4pqyd0,[Discussion] Any guesses on what special song GOT7 will sing for their USA tour stops?,Infinitize-It,1466828102,"Outside of Korea and Japan, GOT7 have prepared a special song cover for every country. The songs they pick are originally by singers from that country and seem to have all been slow ballads.

Shanghai and Guangzhou [ (I Love You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqr_h2SNRM)

Bangkok [ (Love You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq-mg91yajE)

Singapore [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHZXv7YgnE)

So any guesses or wishes for their US concerts? I would say Justin Bieber's Love Yourself because they've been singing that a lot recently but 1) he's Canadian and 2) it isn't really a love song. Maybe something by Chris Brown? Yugyeom and I think JB have said they've been inspired by him. With You would fit, but that might just be my inner Inspirit talking. Maybe John Legend's All of Me for something more recent? I feel like people would die if they did that.

Edit: Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud is also a possibility if they just go for a pop song and not necessarily an American singer.",7,5
