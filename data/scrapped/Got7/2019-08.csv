Keep Spinning in Melbourne will be my first Got7 and k-pop concert i've ever attended, and i will be going alone since none of my friends were able to come.

If there's anyone out there who want to travel with me (i'm coming to Rod Laver from the north side) or be friends in the queue or something please DM me!! I'd love to make some new friends because nothing hurts more than screaming the lullaby fanchant alone!!

For background info: I'm a friendly 19yo female and I go to uni in the city :) Jaebeom is my bias but ofc everyone else is a biaswrecker hahaha

Enjoyed all their content, watched all the videos, etc. Kept it up for a while but my interest in kpop started winding down and GOT7 ended up being one of the first groups I dropped, the last thing I remember kinda enjoying was 'Just Right' because by the time 'If you do' came out I was completely disinterested.

I never truly dropped kpop 100% but pretty much haven't been part of a fandom in 3 years. But about a month ago one of GOT7's recent American interviews came up on my youtube recommended, I watched it and felt nostalgic so I dug up a few more videos. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA because now im hardcore slipping back into being a fan again after essentially 4 years of ignorance...regrets

So I'm looking to see if anyone can help me with like, a GOT7 sparknotes version. They have so much content and I feel overwhelmed just looking at their vlive page, I've already watched both hard carry series and the jeju miniseries but have no idea what to watch next. Are there any core moments/varieties that I should watch? Anything I should know as a (sort-of) new fan? Memes? Lol

My bias is and has always been Jinyoung (weird to call him that now bc he's still Jr. to me in my head lmao) but now also Jackson, surprisingly, as I didn't like him much before. But I still like all other members too, any help is gratefully appreciated ;;",2,10,False,self,,,,,

The song that will 200% make me cry whenever I hear it is 'I Am Me' (I am not even joking, the waterworks start almost immediately), mainly because it was released at a particular juncture in my life where I am was going through some exciting but scary life changes. I listen to it every time to remind myself to be brave and live the life I've always wanted to live. Special thanks to Jinyoung for those fantastic lyrics. 

Coming in a close second is 'Miracle', there is something about Yugyeom's high note that punches me in the gut every time! And also because it is generally a warm and fuzzy song.
