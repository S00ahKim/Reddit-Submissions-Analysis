So I really want to go to one of the concert for this world tour and the closest one for me is Australia (I live in NZ). However, I also want to take my lil sister with me, but she lives in Indonesia. 
So I kind of thinking of taking the risk to wait, in case they decide to add Singapore or Malaysia or Thailand, or even Jakarta for this world tour and just go there since it's most likely gonna be cheaper. Also, I feel like the probability of them not going to Thailand (at least) is pretty low. 
What do you guys think? We could both go to Australia, its not a problem, but if we could minimise the expense, then why not.
