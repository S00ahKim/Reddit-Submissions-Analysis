I wanted to tell my sister who also likes k-pop but doesn't stan them that i thought it looked like jackson but then i was like no, she'll probably say it looks nothing like him. So i carried on walking but then i realised that right next next to his face it said jackson wang. I shouted my oh my gosh it's jackson and my mum and sister were like who? and i was like from got7!

I'm planning on going to the London concert on the 11th of October, however, I'd be flying from Hungary and I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands because of that. WizzAir is offering really cheap flight prices to London right now, and I don't know how long those offers are going to last, but I'm afraid that they will get much more expensive by next Wednesday, when ticket sales are on. Normally I would wait until I have my concert tickets to book a flight, but I couldn't afford to spend double on flight tickets, as the concert tickets themselves already turned out to be more expensive than I anticipated (I'm still a student and only work part-time). Also, I have used AXS before and I absolutely hated it, and I'm scared that I might not get tickets after all, so even getting the cheap flight would be money thrown out the window.

What would you do in my place? Should I book the flight regardless? Do you think I can definitely get tickets? I mean, I could even get BTS tickets this year (to Paris, though), but I'm still undecisive. I don't know how big the GOT7 London fanbase is, plus as far as I know this will be their first time in London.

TAKE A BOW fansite had a cute cup sleeve event for Jinyoungs birthday this weekend! The whole cafe was decked out in photos of Jinyoung taken by TAB, and it was such a cute little gallery style mini exhibition. 

On all the drinks, you had the option to pick a photo of Jinyoung that they printed directly on the foam top of the drink!! I chose the one of him with the puppy :) They also had printed macarons with art from @abimabima and those were sooo cute as well! 

In a small room inside the cafe, TAB had a whole set up of their past photobooks of Jinyoung for fans to flip through, as well as cute little merch items theyve made in the past! Theres a screen in the room and they were playing a really sweet video they made; part of it was a really cute song over some clips of Jinyoung smiling and waving at fans, and then the rest was a really lovely compilation of fancams of their performances from every single era in order starting at JJ Project (my heart!! ) all the way up to the Hey Guys fansign that was last weekend.

It was such a cute experience and there are a lot of cute gifts the fansite prepared like a beautiful handfan, photo cards, stickers, and a pamphlet!! 

Thats all! In case anyone biases Jinyoung but couldnt be here, I wanted to post some photos and the experience for you all to read ^^
