0,Got7,t5_2zrs4,2016-1-2,2016,1,2,4,3z1mug,self.Got7,[Discussion] Which was your favorite year-end performance by GOT7?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Got7/comments/3z1mug/discussion_which_was_your_favorite_yearend/,Infinitize-It,1451675243,"GOT7 and JYPE worked hard this year to come up with a different performance of If You Do at each year-end Gayo and MAMA this year. Which was your favorite one? Whether it be for the remix, the dance changes, tricks, or any other reason.

For reference: [MAMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWzj7_W_eYY) | [SBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S2CbVnW-7o) | [KBS broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IeN3WKad1M)/[KBS wide shot fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbQAPtb7cEs)/[KBS close-up fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ4zoxFOwDM) | [MBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnIgHWZtDGI)

My favorite was the KBS performance. There was some really great martial arts tricking in the intro (it's a shame it wasn't all captured) and I really liked the remix starting from the bridge. Special shoutout though to Jackson's trust fall from the box at MBC.

BONUS: GOT7 did extra duty, having a special colaboration stage at each festival. Which was your favorite among these?

[MAMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijIAsl0OM8) | [SBS](https://youtu.be/kOFPkoU7AA0?t=106) | [KBS broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ixRP5KB3hg)/[KBS GOT7 dance fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HN5ndQ-QoM)/[KBS group dance fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZD6g1Vdgw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=66) | [MBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwFu9UCsQv0)

This is a hard choice for me, but again, I have to give it to KBS. There was lots of martial arts tricking, and some that we haven't seen from GOT7 before, like BamBam's swing. Plus the group dance at the end was really well done, incorporating point dances from all 3 groups.",2,8,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure if that survey was then officially released to the public for feedback, or if someone just memorized the questions, but regardless, [we now have the survey](https://twitter.com/got7co/status/689932154613067776) (in multiple languages too) and the results will be compiled and sent to JYPE for review.

I'm not sure if it's necessarily helpful to be getting feedback from people that are already fans, as opposed to feedback from non-fans to see what it would take to make them fans, but I think it's really cool how JYPE is open to feedback. Maybe it's because I've never been so deep into any other fandom before, but this is the first time I'm seeing something like this, and it kind of makes you feel valued as a fan.

The deadline to complete the survey is January 31 (KST). Take a look and fill it out to get your opinions in. Also, be constructive in your responses! Try not to just give short answers that JYPE won't be able to do anything with.",3,2,False,self,,,,,
