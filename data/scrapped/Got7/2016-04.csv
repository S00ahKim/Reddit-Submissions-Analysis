Day 1

There will probably be more complete fancams tomorrow (if fans can sneak their phones out to record without security finding out) but here are what I see as some highlights that I've seen from the concert.

* JB and Youngjae's Duet [""1:31AM""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm_2EVEF9xk&amp;feature=youtu.be) (written by JB). I think most fans can agree that this was one of the most heartbreaking moments of the night. With JB's vocal recording, close-ups of the chair for when he is supposed to sing, and Youngjae standing there on stage by himself, choking up at the end. I made the mistake of reading about this stage while on the bus to work, and I was in tears, so I had to stop myself from reading anything else about the concert until I got home from work.

* Mark and Junior singing a song Junior composed, ""Higher"". I haven't seen any fancams of this yet, but I hope there will be one. Apparently [Mark was in a pink suit and Junior was in a blue one.](https://twitter.com/flawlesswang/status/726017237845315587)

* Jackson, BamBam, and Yugyeom singing Jackson's song ""YOLO."" Finally we get to hear the song Jackson has been waiting to show everyone. [Short fancam](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726018503245860868) (of course there's dabbing) and [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3RUCdJbl1U).

* Girl group dances. But first, an introductory VCR which includes [BamBam nearly killing JB trying to be sexy.](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726021647963066368) Mark, Junior, and Youngjae covered [GFriend's Me Gustas Tu](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726021477770780672) and (JB), Jackson, BamBam, and Yugyeom did [Red Velvet's Dumbx3.](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726022639353892864)

* And of course, [JB's surprise appearance at the end.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_W4f7vMQI8) I haven't watched it through yet, but somewhere in that video, there is [this moment](https://twitter.com/GOT7jjai/status/726091221416992769) where Jackson tries to stop JB from bowing too deeply, but JB brushes his hand away and bows normally. You can really tell how much the other members care about and missed him. They never let the fans forget that he was missing, and even had the crowd [chanting JB](https://twitter.com/GOT_7_CHAI/status/726030435067662336) at the start of Just Right.

Feel free to spazz in the comments or share other things you think were highlights!

EDIT:

Day 2

* 1:31 AM was actually co-composed and co-written by JB and Youngjae. And now there's a [full fancam!](http://www.weibo.com/p/230444328b4d4fcffcb11a485959b35724ffd7) Here's also a [rough translation](https://twitter.com/tuanique/status/726388302425661440) and God, I don't know how Youngjae was able to keep it together for the whole song considering everything that happened in the days leading up to the concert.

* [Full Audio](https://soundcloud.com/marknior-markjin/higher) of Higher, and the [VCR](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726318492744478720) leding up to it!

* [Day6](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726338281953054720) dancing to Home Run on the dance cam.

* [Jackson](https://twitter.com/Jackson__Boy/status/726346365916184576) being worried about JB's back again.

* There was a surprise event today where GOT7's family wrote messages for their sons and to Ahgases. [All of their parents were there,](https://twitter.com/linbea945/status/726429728400240640) except for Jackson's because of his mom's health (which made me realize that this must make him extra sensitive about JB's back). [Thread of translations](https://twitter.com/shmesm/status/726358500289306626) for some, [Mark's mom's](https://twitter.com/GOT7jjai/status/726354342555602944), [Mark's sister's](https://twitter.com/jinxpil/status/726359213505536000), and [JB's mom's](https://twitter.com/fuckboytuan/status/726408719207014401). JB also sang a little bit of [Forever Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ4zgN_4Jaw&amp;feature=youtu.be) during this montage.
