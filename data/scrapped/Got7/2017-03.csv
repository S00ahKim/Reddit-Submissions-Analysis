The thing is it would my first concert and thinking about it is making me kinda nervous. I have a few questions like, what are vvip tickets and what's the price range for them? Are they worth it or not? Also do the vvip tickets give you priority privileges? Oh and one last question ;w; does GOT7's concerts even have vvip tickets? I'll be happy to accept any other tips besides vvip! Thanks for the help if you do answer! :)",4,5

Those of you who were here last year might have seen the spreadsheet I linked here listing all (at least all I could remember) the shows GOT7 had been part of since debut. However I excluded a lot of shows the boys may have done solo.

With their 'Never Ever' comeback I thought I would post it here again because I'm sure we have new IGOT7s who might want to see what they can watch that the boys have been on.

I stopped updating around November of 2016 because I got busy/lazy but I've hopefully added everything between then and now. If I haven't, it'd be super helpful if you could tell me what I'm missing.

Additionally, there are other tabs on the spreadsheet which explains the colour key and a 'Specials/Cuts' tab which is just extra clips I didn't feel like would fit in the 'Shows' portion but are still fun to watch. This is stuff like VCRs, special variety show clips, etc.

Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XfqnsQSLqjV5U_pRU3wQrdZ3atfAJ4QrF8n9XJEiEzY/edit?usp=sharing

If any links are broken, please DM me either on twitter, discord or reddit! Thank you!
