My fiancee has recently become rather obsessed with k-pop, specifically Got7. I'm looking for something sweet to get her for Christmas,  though I have absolutely no idea where to look, or what to get.

She's bought a bunch of albums, so I'd hesitate to buy those incase I get her something she already has. If it's relevant, her favourite band member is Jaebum. 

Any help would be super helpful. Cheers.",3,8

46,2017-11-30,2017,11,30,5,7ggfx7,Does the negativity around GOT7's music affect your fan experience?,valvietd,1511987664,"I'm not sure if I'll get any answers since the community is not very active, but it doesn't hurt to try and start a discussion anyway :P

I became a GOT7 fan during Fly era, and although I was (and am) excited about the fandom and sales growing with each release after that, I also started getting back into other groups and following k-pop in general more closely. That meant being exposed to all the opinions non-fans have about GOT7's music. 

**Sometimes I question my own musical taste:** given that I love or grew to like most of GOT7's title tracks. In some of their songs, there are parts that I find could have been rapped better, sung better or needed better lyric flow, but nothing that makes me think they are terrible. And yet, if you go look at any discussion being held by people who aren't ahgase, there's people who hate it, people who think it's ok, and rarely people who really liked the songs...

I often feel very frustrated as a fan because people already have a negative view on them and no matter how good the song is they will keep being negative. Even non-fans who like the song, they'll spend 1 minute praising the new song and 20 talking about how the previous albums were so bad. This makes me **discouraged to speak freely about what I really thought of the songs**, because I don't want to add to the negativity.

And I guess finally, **it makes me scared** for their future, I keep being afraid we have reached our fandom peak, of not having anyone else interested in giving GOT7 a try because they just assume they aren't talented....

I really love them and want them to succeed, but sometimes I feel really stressed about not being able to help them grow (which is why I'm now trying to liven up this community)

So, anyone else feels the same?
