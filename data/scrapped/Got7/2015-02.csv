I know this is a pretty dead subreddit from the looks of it, but I just wanted to introduce myself! I'm a pretty new listener to kpop, but not to the korean entertainment industry (long time lover of kdramas, but I recently branched into variety shows where I met Jackson on Roommate) and after being instilled so many GOT7 introductions on that show, I decided to check them out, and I just have to say WOW.

For a rookie group, I'm really enjoying their songs. Definitely has a really fun vibe to it and I'm LOVING them! Even as a guy, I can have my guy biases and that has to be JB and Jackson. So talented, and I can't wait to hear more of their stuff!",2,2,False,self,,,,,
