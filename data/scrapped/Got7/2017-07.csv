I know for a while this subreddit has gone without an active mod but there are now new ones in place (you can check on the sidebar who the new mods are).

Hopefully we'll be able to clean up the subreddit if things that shouldn't be here (sorry Game of Thrones fans) are posted. It helps if you guys report posts too so it's immediately brought to our attention.

Hopefully we can get this subreddit looking nice and becoming active!

If you have any suggestions or questions, please don't hesitate to comment them or message us.

Recently checked out some of Got7s songs and am looking forward to checking out their others

As a Twice fan, does Got7 have any tv shows that give us a behind the scenes look of their lives as celebrities or shows that show them traveling? 
Twice has a wiki for this stuff https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/wiki/index and it gives us a list of the shows that have been made on twice. Is there anything like that for Got7? 

Any help appreciated.

I'm one of this subreddit's new mods. Last week I started putting GOT7's schedule for the week on the sidebar for anyone who wanted to keep up with all of the teaser releases for JJ Project's Verse 2. (Not sure how many people noticed though, since I just did it on a whim.) I planned to update it every Sunday (EST/EDT) with the coming week's activities, but I realized when updating it this week that it might be good to archive each week. Unfortunately I already lost last week's, but from now on, I was thinking I would make it a stickied post each Sunday with the next week's schedule. This way, not only is it more visible, but also people can talk about it and also let me know if I miss anything.

Let me know what you guys think about this, and if you have any problems or suggestions for improvement. I'll leave the schedules in the sidebar too for anyone who wants a quick reference.

Without further ado, here is GOT7's schedule for next week.

Let's liven this place up with multiple banners like /r/Kpop ! I'm thinking of having a total of 9 banners, 1 for the whole team, 7 for each individual, and 1 for JJProject. But don't be limited by my suggestion and feel free to post less than 9 banners, or other styles of banners that you like. 

The pictures should be

- High-def

- Width should be at least 1366 px or bigger

- For the height.. around 300 px, I'll let you guys decide, but it must be the same for all of your banners.

- Specify which banner is the main banner that would be shown to first time guests/non-redditors.

The winner will be the one with the most upvotes, so have fun!
