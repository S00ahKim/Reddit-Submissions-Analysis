This is my first kpop concert and will be my first time in Newark/New York. I have so many questions and I can't seem to find a good place to ask, so I'm hoping some of you can answer any. Any help you give is much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

1. I just read that they won't be selling official merch at the venue? How can this be? 
2. How early should I expect to get there? If fans are selling merch, then at what time should I get there before they sell out? I'm hoping to not have to get there at 10am but I also want to make sure I get some merch before they are sold out.
3. Will anyone be selling merch after the show?
4. How long is the show?
5. Anything else I should know?

My sister and I are trying to sell this last ticket because some one backed out last minute :(  
It'd be a shame to have an empty seat on the floor. The seat is pretty close to the extended stage!  
Unfortunately, because its a VIP ticket, its will call. You'd have to meet us before the show to grab the ticket and VIP package that comes with it. If you'd like more proof about us or the ticket, don't hesitate to ask.

126,2019-6-30,2019,6,30,1,c70y2a,GOT7 Newark Concert Tips and Experience!,sailor-wallflower,1561824856,"Hi everyone!

So I went to the GOT7 concert in Newark and it was AMAZING!!! The boys were so incredible live! Their setlist was so good and I love how they took time to talk with us and have fun with us! But I've seen a lot of people asking about things about the concert so I thought I would tell you guys about my experience with merch and the venue.

1. The Merch

So yeah, the merch variety was really limited and the shirt designs were kinda meh. But they had PLENTY of shirts in all sizes, so don't worry about them selling out! I got there at 5:00pm (doors opened at 6:30pm) and the merch line wasn't long at all, I waited like 7-10 minutes in line. We thought for a second that they sold out of lightsticks but this awesome staff member brought two more boxes full of lightsticks, so don't worry about them selling out since they seem to have a lot of them in stock! Also side note, they didn't sell the button set. I heard from a staff member that the shipment of button sets never arrived so beware that they may not sell the button set at your concert!

2. The Venue

At the Newark venue (Prudential Center) they had a lot of rules. Of course, rules vary from each venue but Prudential Center really sucked at telling us the rules. These things may not apply to your concert venue but I just want to warn you guys if your venue doesn't clearly tell you the rules like Prudential Center. First, it took a LONG time to get through security. We only had about 15 people in front of us and it took us 35 minutes to get through security (just walking though the metal detector and having someone check out bags.) Speaking of bags, I highly suggest taking a small bag. I called Pru Center ahead of time asking if they had a bag policy and they said no. However, once we got there, they checked our bag size and we could only have a certain size. I feel so bad for the people with larger bags, they had to leave the line and figure out what to do. The security was really rude, I made my friend and I fans with large popsicle sticks to hold them and they said it wasn't allowed (even though I never saw it anywhere online.) We had to break the sticks and just kept the fan part which doesn't make sense since it was more dangerous now since the sticks didn't break evenly so we had a fan with a sharp ending lol. Also, no signs of any size were allowed (even though online it said signs were allowed) so the fans with signs had to leave them in a big pile outside. Just want to warn you guys in advance to throughly read your venue's rules and maybe call ahead of time if you have any questions at all!

&amp;#x200B;

3. The Concert

One word: AMAZING!!! GOT7 are just such a talented and awesome group! I think the most important thing is to have fun and don't worry about what other people think. My friend is a huge Yugyeom fan and every time he sang, we screamed and cheered for him. The people in front of us kept looking back at us and rolling their eyes. My friend was a little embarrassed at first, but I told them not to worry about it and to have fun and we did! If you have a problem with people cheering for their favorite boy, maybe you shouldn't go to their concert lol. Also, be aware if you're taking an Uber/Lyft to leave the concert, it's going to be expensive. Me and my friend walked about 5 minutes away from the venue to get an Uber and it was a lot cheaper so if you can, I recommend leaving the crowded venue to a less crowded area if you can! 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically just be aware of your venue's rules, they're pretty strict about things! And don't worry about them running out of merch, just get their a bit early if you can! And make sure to have fun no matter what other's may think! I hope this helped and I hope that every IGOT7 that goes to see them has a wonderful and fun time like we did! \^\^",32,55
