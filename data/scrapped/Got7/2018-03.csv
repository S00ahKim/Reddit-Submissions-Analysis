We welcome this new comeback with a new theme! :) I won't make this too long because in a few minutes we're gonna be terribly busy listening to the new album! A few announcements:

# RULES PAGE

The rules page has been updated accordingly to the guidelines we mods have been following when posting and (very rarely) deleting comments. We hope everyone will read and follow those as well, and that posting will be less confusing for those who wish to contribute now! In the future we'll also be adding a Flair guideline wiki, but since flairs can be changed, don't feel too pressured about it!

# SEARCH BY FLAIR

The new theme has a quick search filter feature to help you find stuff faster! On the menu bar you can find some quick links under ""search by flair"", they'll redirect you to a search page that already filters things by date and flair. All you need to do is add any words you would like to search for, or browse the results! If it doesn't work properly, just delete any '+' from the search input field or open it on a new tab.

That's it! Happy Comeback Week everyone!",3,7
