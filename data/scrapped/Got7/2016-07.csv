Link is [here.](https://www.facebook.com/subkultureent/)

Important Notice for those who plan on attending the #FLYinDALLAS show tonight.

It comes with great disappointment that due to GOT7s Youngjae falling ill, he will be unable to perform for the Dallas show tonight being held at the Verizon Theatre. Although this is the last thing we all would have wanted, it was ultimately decided that his health comes first, and giving him the rest that he needs at this time is most important.

We strongly encourage those who planned on attending the Dallas show to still come out and show support for GOT7, as this will be the groups first full concert in the US. However, if you no longer wish to attend the show due to Youngjaes inability to perform tonight, then we will issue you a full refund. Please understand that if you do choose to receive a refund for this show, then you are forfeiting your ticket, along with any benefits it might come with. In other words, you cannot attend the show and request a refund as well.

Please also note that this refund offer is only valid for customers who purchased their tickets through AXS or StubHub, as these are the official ticketing and partner sites for this show.

More information on how and when you can request a refund will be posted shortly.

Once again, we are extremely saddened by these unforeseen circumstances, and we at SubKulture Entertainment wish a swift recovery for Youngjae.

As of now, the other cities are not affected. If there are any changes, we will update everyone.
Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this notice, please send an email to info@subkultureent.com.",0,10,False,self,,,,,

Hey guys, I don't know many of you were streaming Fly in Dallas, but the setlist was kinda different in that they didn't do the whole girl group/cross-dressing section :/ So, it seems they're not doing Me Gustas Tu, Dumb dumb dumb and Hooked for the tour. Unless they made this decision because Youngjae didn't perform but I'm not too sure since they still did these performances when JB was out. Thoughts? Also, they didn't do a special song like we thought they might've lol",5,6,False,self,,,,,

The only other kpop concert she (or I) had been to was Epic High in Atl last year.  

___

We went to the mall across the street first, about two hours before the show, to enjoy some icecream and relax. No sooner did we sit down in the food court did my daughter start seeing Got7 shirts everywhere. We saw three girls with High Touch wrist bands. My daughter was scolding me about staring at them because she was kind of nervous. I called them over anyway to talk about how they managed to get their P2 tickets, when I tried so hard but only managed meager tickets because of web browser issues.  

Soon enough my daughter and the girls were in full Got7 and kpop conversational bliss. My daughter has little to no opportunity to engage in kpop conversation with anyone living on the South side of ATL.  

The three girls were from Ashville, and there with one their moms. Out of nowhere the girls start freaking out. JRE, a popular Youtuber, had just walked into the courtyard and sat down just 20 feet from us. One of the girls wanted a picture with him, but was too nervous and freaked out to go over there. They didn't want to go over there for fears of annoying him, to which I responded that it was his job and responsibility as a celebrity personality to expect this behavior from fans. If he was with his family, sure it would be rude, but this was a full-on celebrity moment and he should expect it.  My daughter asked if she really wanted a picture and that she would go over there with her and get one. So they all went over to JRE's table and got selfies with him. They were so excited when they returned from his table. I was so proud of my daughter for stepping up and pushing through the fear!  

Afterwards the three girls went and got food and actually came over and sat with my daughter. My daughter was so excited to encounter such nice people, and this wouldn't disappoint her the rest of the evening.  

It was time to go get into parking. Instagrams and Twitters were exchanged and off we went to the venue. Parking was a breeze with the prebought parking ticket. We walked up the stairs to the front of the venue and BAM the massive crowd was assembling. Throughout the sea of iGOT7's were all varieties of Got7 merch you could ever imagine. My daughter knew them all and was in awe. The highlight of this time was when JRE arrived and the crowd went nuts and rushed over to meet him.  

The doors finally opened and in we all went in the most orderly of manners. I'm from a heavy metal background and show entree crowds are not always the most pleasant. I instinctively went into positional guard mode. I was on alert looking for anyone attempting to cut in line and take our precious spots. Soon I realized this was not necessary. I was very happy and surprised to see the calm stream of the crowd into the venue. No pushing, no shoving, no cutting in line...a thing of beauty really!  

Upon entering the venue we got in the long line for the meager merch selection. WHY ON EARTH they didn't have a wider variety of merch is beyond me. Do they not understand that we are a kpop merch starved people over here in the USA? We would have bought everything and anything with Got7 on it.  

I saw a few people cut in the merch line. Understand that i'm 6'3"" and about 290 LBS. I towered above ever single person in this place. I resign myself to just giving dirty looks though. ""This isn't Slayer"", I kept telling myself.  

After gather my daughter's merch we head up to our seats. Once there, and with full confidence that everyone there was the same as her, my daughter instantly made friends with everyone around her. I just sat in my chair recovering from the massive ammount of stairs I just climbed, and gazing over the massive sellout crowd and sea of green light sticks (well more like a pond than a sea I guess).  

---

SHOW TIME!!!  

Let me preface this with just saying i'm not your ordinary kpop fan dad.  
Read my story here: [How I got into KPOP](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/4lgay0/us_folks_how_did_you_fall_into_the_pitfall_of_kpop/)  

The show was absolutely amazing to me. Frankly, I LOVE ""Moriagatte Yo"" because of its hard hitting. Most other Got7 is a little soft for me. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Got7, I'm just a huge fan of heavier stuff. I still have Got7 in my playlist and enjoy them greatly.  

I also created an MP3 playlist of Fly Seoul setlist, and have listened to this leading up to the show. So I knew every single song they play (that I could hear over the screaming).  

They played the Seoul setlist almost exactly with a few exceptions. They danced awesomely. Their singing was great LIVE! So many of the videos of MAMA awards and such have so much lipsyncing that I was worried I would have to deal with this, but was pleasantly surprised they were really singing! I loved their interactions with the audience. I ever really loved their VCR videos they played. They were definitely high energy all the way through.  

My favorite song was the combination VCR/Live performance of Confession Song. At first, with the video getting the audience to sing, it felt like we were all singing ""I Love You"" to them, and then when they came out, they sang it to US! Very moving and the crowd loved it too! The dance competition was also awesome. Great job those of you that got chosen to dance on camera!  

BIG shout out to the girl that did the beat boxing! Good job!  

Of course my daughter's bias is Bam Bam. Although I could easily recognize him, I was reminded it was him singing/rapping by this massive pain in my left ear from her screaming at break glass levels.

As far as expectations go I give this show a 11/10 really. And I don't give credit lightly. I've seen some of the all-time great performances in rock and roll and classical music. They seriously brung it big time. KUDOS Got7!  

OH...and I have it recorded...they PROMISED they would return to ATL. I'm holding them to their word. ATL is so often overlooked for kpop concerts it's not even funny.  

Funny addition...  

While leaving and walking down the stairs inside the venue some girl behind us is just calling out in desperation, ""Does anyone have a battery charger?"" I turned and just casually said, ""um...I have one."" We move off to the side and plugged her up to my battery. Again my daughter went into full kpop conversation mode and the two just chattered on like long lost friends. The girl was from Miami and traveled to ATL to see Got7. She informed us that Monsta X ans Seventeen were coming to Miami in Nov....hmmm *wink* lol. Once her phone was charged enough to turn on she messaged her friend that was over in High Touch land. All of a sudden the girl squealed, ""Remember when one of the members grabbed the phone from the crowd and sang to it? That was MY FRIEND'S phone!!!"" Again her and my daughter exchanged social media and off we went for the ride home.  

On the way home we stopped at Waffle House for an after concert meal, as was always tradition in my rock concert days.  

Thus ended an AWESOME evening with my precious daughter, an awesome crowd of people, and a most awesome kpop group!
