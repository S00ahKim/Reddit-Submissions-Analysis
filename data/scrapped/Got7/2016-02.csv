The episodes are divided into segments following different groups of people, so the links go straight to the beginning of the segment in which Jackson appears. 

* [Episode 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC83VyI_xuM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=983) making kimchi with Soomi and Park Myungsoo.

* [Epsiode 24](https://youtu.be/1Us2xl2WDXo?t=2797) marks the beginning of his appearance with Twice's Tzuyu for Lunar New Year, where Kyungkyu and Youngnam ""teach"" them about Korean culture.

* [Epsiode 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiUbwKHwDbs) has Jackson, Tzuyu, Kyungkyu, and Youngnam hiking up a mountain, trying weird Korean food, and visiting a Korean spa (for Jackson's like 5th time on TV).

* [Episode 26 part 1](https://youtu.be/srSeym6F2ZQ?t=778) has Jackson and Tzuyu visiting Chinatown. [Part 2](https://youtu.be/srSeym6F2ZQ?t=2352) is the start of his guesting with Twice's Nayeon as part of a panel talking about the concerns of people of different age groups.

* [Episode 27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvHd0Xtwq-E) is the conclusion of the panel, with Jackson and the others playing the ""Of Course"" game from X-man.

* [Episode 28](https://youtu.be/5PojZeJ4XNs?t=1539) is the start of Jackson's regular appearances with g.o.d's Joonhyung, including Jackson picking up Joon from the airport and having an MT with the rest of the cast.

Upcoming episodes will have Joon visiting GOT7's dorm to lay down some rules (filmed before Yugyeom's graduation) and Jackson and Joon getting Korean lessons from 2PM's Wooyoung.",0,2
