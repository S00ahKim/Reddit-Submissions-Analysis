I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Japan for my birthday! It just so happens that Got7 is also holding a concert at Kobe World Hall nearby. I am thinking of purchasing my tickets either from viagogo or stubhub. The tickets on both website say reserved which I am assuming is just a seat.

Which would be a safer choice?

Also how long before the concert should I line up?

Are there any other tips and advice you can give me?

What kind of things should I bring?
