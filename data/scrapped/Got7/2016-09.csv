This morning I wake up to news that Jackson was in a car accident with sasaengs. Apparently the day before staff chased away fans before they could see Jackson. So what do the obsessive sasaengs do? They hire a van to chase after Jackson's. While Jackson was in the back asleep in his van, the sasaengs are speeding following behind. Jackson's van ends up having to slam on the breaks causing the saseangs van to slam into them from behind. Thankfully no one was seriously injured but Jackson has pain on his waist. Staff say he may have pulled it. Here is why I say we don't deserve this Angel...he went to the ""Fans"" in the van and asked THEM were they alright. He didn't get mad like anyone else would but he was worried about them. I truly hope those girls learn their lesson and I hope nothing like this happens again. ",4,19

The [Vancouver fan meet](https://www.facebook.com/events/1807026999532511/) is on November 11th. The [Toronto fan meet](https://www.facebook.com/events/951400975006365/) will be on November 13th.

Tickets range from $95-300.

18,2016-9-21,2016,9,21,15,53ruoc,Group Order Compilation for Flight Log: Turbulence,Infinitize-It,1474438680,"Since it seems like Flight Log:Turbulence will be random among 8 different versions, I don't want that to deter people from buying an album to support GOT7. So I thought I would compile a list of group orders for various countries that will offer to open albums and try to give everyone their preferred version(s) given the haul that they get. It might be a little more expensive than other places and there's no guarantee that you will definitely get your choices, but IMO it's worth it to not get completely random albums, especially if you're buying multiple ones.

If you know of a trustworthy group order for your country, comment with it and I will add it to the list. Or if you don't see your country on the list, comment and I will keep an eye out for one. Let's try and get GOT7 some more music show wins!

It was enough for me to pause the video to double check, and yep, its Toronto subway stops, but in the wrong order.

Any reason why this would be here?!

P.S. sorry for making you watch this video if you haven't seen it before. It's unfortunate in a lot of ways lol
