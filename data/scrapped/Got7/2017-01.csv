Besides the rude staff, the fan meet was absolutely amazing. Just seeing the boys in the flesh was such a great experience. They were lively and energetic, and we could all tell they were having a good time. After the fan meeting comes time for p1 photos and p2 hi-touch. Myself and my friend had p2 tickets, and we waited for p1 to go first. We wanted to be last in line for the hi-touch, but so many other fans had that idea in mind. The staff was starting to get rude and telling us to go. We just said screw it and went ahead instead of being last. First in line was Jinyoung. OMFG! He looks so majestic in real life. He literally looks like royalty, so I see where the nickname Prince Jinyoung came about. His smile was so big and bright. He had the softest hands that I've ever felt. Next was Youngjae, he is so precious. JB is so handsome in person! Then came Yugyeom! He stared into my soul during hi-touch. Such a bias wrecker. Next came Jackson. I told him to stay healthy and he didn't even look at me :( I wonder why, sigh. Oh well. Maybe next time. Next was Mark and he is so sweet and handsome. Bambam was distracted at the end because someone was talking to him. Some tips for hi-touch would be to try and go as slow as you can even though staff will rush you. Try to be the last fan if you can. I will try to get a photo op next time! ",9,11,False,self,,,,,
