I only started watching this series in October and absolutely loved it, as I always knew I would. I am a big fan of ROME. I'm watching it through for the second time right now, almost at the end of Season 2. While I've been watching I've been noticing several things I missed the first time around and I've got a few questions about some minor details.

Some of these might just be plot mistakes. Or they might be missing details that did not make it from the book to tv. Either way, I very much appreciate any answers. I'd check the wiki but I'm afraid I'll spoil things for myself. I've only seen the first two seasons so if things are explained in S3 then I'd be thankful if you didn't say anything.

First of all, in an early episode when Jorah finds out Daenerys is pregnant he says he must ride for Qohor. Next episode he is by her side without a word. What is that about? Is this him reporting to Robert?

In a recent episode Tywin says to Arya ""They are calling it the war of five kings."" Joffrey, Renly, Stannis, Robb. Who is the fifth king here? Is it Daenerys? How does he even know she is alive?

When Ser... Onion Knight is speaking to Stannis and telling him ""the hard truth"" Stannis reveals he plans to put him at the head of the fleet. He then says ""Hard Truths cut both ways."" Is he sending him there to because the chances of him dying are high much like Tyrion being placed in the vanguard?

Why is securing The Twins important to Robb at all? Looking at the wap they pass from east to west. They seem utterly pointless in his advance. The road doesn't even go across the bridge. Is this just conflicting story and map details or is there something I'm missing here?

What happened to Ser Alliser (not sure on spelling here). Ser Mormont sent him away from Castle Black to request more troops but later we see Cersei reading a letter sent from Ser Mormont requesting more troops.

Who is the Nights Watch member who has suddenly started hanging around with Sam, Jon and their friend? What happened to Pyp?

What happened to Greatjon (Humber?)? He just vanished and has now been replaced with Lord Bolton.

When Daenerys first approachs Qarth she is greeted outside. At one point she says ""Quarth"" and is immediately interrupted with ""Qarth."" Aside from the fact she had already said Qarth in Season 1, she asks Jorah about it when it is first suggested, in turn suggesting she knows nothing about the city. If the Dothraki don't use money, are they likely to use written language? If someone said Qarth to me vocally, I don't think I would have spelled it with a Q. And so if she hasn't ""read"" Qarth, why would she pronounce it with the common ""qu"" noise? Just a small thing I noticed.

Lastly, how much time has passed over the course of the two series? Is this all happening within the space of a few weeks or have years passed?

Thank you so much if you read all of that. I'd talk for hours about how much I love the series if I thought anyone would listen. Looking forward to joining the community once I get my hands on Season 3 come February, if only for a few weeks before S4 comes along and I have to wait another year before I catch up.",37,46,False,self,,,,,

I'm working on a project where I make a version of Ticket to Ride using the map of Westeros. It's very early stages. Just trying to figure out how to make everything still.

Just a question to all of you on something I'm struggling with. Game concept. I want to have a reason the game exists if that makes sense, in Ticket to Ride it's train routes, but what would they be claiming in the Westeros version? In the rules for the actual game there's a great story as to what's happening. And I really just need some inspiration in that department, any help is appreciated.

To anyone who cares, I can post the finished project, it's likely to involve a lot of handmade components, so I'm not sure what I provide will be reproducible, but I will definitely be able to give a file for the board. I've already started working on that digitally.

Since I had seen the shows (season 1-2) I started listening at season 3.  Finished two a half books and realized I wasn't absorbing half of what I should have been because I didn't have the background from the first two books.

Rather than finish, I just started over and listened to them all from the beginning.  It was spectacular.  So - if you're thinking of starting the books, do it!  But start from the beginning.  

P.S.  I listened while commuting on my bike, doing yard/house work, etc.   Audible for the win!

Whenever I talk to my friends about Game of Thrones I ask them who they want to win in the end and 9/10 times they say Dany. 

I'm pretty sure Dany would make the absolute worst ruler out of all the people currently trying to win the Iron Throne...

Problem 1 with Dany) She can't have any more kids so she would be without an heir, and when rulers die without an heir they live a gaping void that normally lead to civil wars.

Problem 2) She is a product of generations of inbreeding and while it's not certain that she will fall to madness like her father and brother(?) 

Problem 3) I get that she absolutely hates slavery. I can understand that hatred, however what gives her the right to move into ancient cities and fuck with thousands of years of status quo? She has no claim to power in the east...

These are the three main problems I have with Dany, she does whatever she wants (Much like her father) she is heir-less.

What redeeming quality does she have? ",122,23,False,default,,,,,

Of Course Spoilers Throughout so You've been warned. 

Here is my best guess for right now. 

* [S4E1:](#b ""Reestablish where we left off last season. Episode 1 big reveal might be Coldhands?"")
* [S4E2:](#b ""Ygritte's group attacks Castle Black"")
* [S4E3:](#b ""Purple Wedding"")
* [S4E4:](#b ""Tyrions trial pt 1"")
* [S4E5:](#b ""Tyrions trial pt 2"")
* [S4E6:](#b ""Tyrions trial by combat"")
* [S4E7:](#b ""Stannis arrives at the wall/Battle of Castle Black"")
* [S4E8:](#b ""Filler?"")
* [S4E9:](#b ""Lysa and the Moon Door and/or Tyrion's flight?"")
* [S4E10:](#b ""Jon announced as Lord Commander, Arya finds her ship to Bravos, Meet Lady Stoneheart"")

This is all just my own speculation I'm interested to see what everyone else thinks will happen. I have to say I'm at a bit of a loss as to what they'll do with Bran and Dany since their ASOS storylines kind of wrapped last season. 

It also looks like we'll get a primer on the greyjoys story and the events at the dreadfort/winterfell before we reach season 5. 

What's your speculation?

There are many religions in the show and in the books, and I believe that the question of which gods exist is one of the most interesting, relevant, and open to interpretation.  

In my opinion, there is only one true god in the books, well really two:  R'Hollor God of Light and his opposire, The Other.  The Other is currently contained to North of the Wall, and for the most part that is where his power remains and grows, ever since the White Walkers were awakened.  R'Hollor is the only god who has ever answered the prayers of characters:  When Melisandre birthed the shadow that killed Stannis, and when Thoros of Myr revived Beric Dondarrion (multiple times).  There are more events which could be attributed to the Red God, but those are the most clear-cut.

I believe that the many-faced god of the faceless men of Braavos holds no power.  The skills of the Faceless Men seem to be acquired through practice, as shown by Aryas experience, and we have yet to see proof of the power of this god.  However, in future books this god could prove to be powerful indeed, only Aryas future experiences will tell.  Another possible theory is this god is the same as the one true god, as Ja'qen Hagar refers to him as the red god at times.

The Seven hold absolutely no power.  They have never answered prayers to anyone, and basically get shit on by the other gods.  

The old gods of the North are not in fact gods at all.  They do hold power, but essentially they are just the power of the forest.  Bran is able to tap into this power.  In the end I believe he will be able to do more than just witness events.  He will be able to tap into the network  of living organisms to actually witness events.  The power here comes from a magical network that exists between living organisms and is based somehow on the weirwoods.  This is why the Starks that remain in the North are relatively unharmed, while most of those that went South (Catelyn, Ned, and Robb) did not fair as well.  However, this is a power that is weakening with time, possibly due to the aging overseer of the network.  Hopefully Bran will provide new life for this network, my personal favorite religion.  It could be argued that those controlling this network are in fact gods, though they draw their power not from within themselves, but from organisms.

The Drowned god also has no power.  His chief follower the Damphair, is essentially overmatched by his religions antichrist, Euron Greyjoy.  No god that would allow this to occur could have any real power.  

I think I have addressed most religions in the novels, but did I miss any? What do you think?",13,7,False,self,,,,,

That being said, I have serious questions about the implementation of Stannis' plot in season 4, and I'm curious what y'all think.

My problem is that, if I remember correctly at least, in the books there is no POV chapter for Davos, or for that matter any account of Stannis and his army's trip to the wall.  We essentially go from Davos with a letter, to all of a sudden the shock and surprise that Stannis has come to help the wall at the battle at the wall.

But the problem I foresee is that the battle at the wall, according to information out there on the internet, doesn't happen until the ninth episode.

So where does that leave Stannis, Davos, and Mellisandre, and how doe they implement any kind of plot for them without ruining the surprise of ""wait, who's blowing those trumpets?  Why are there knights in cold steel with flying banners?  Who? What?  OH SHIT IT'S STANNIS!""",41,21,False,self,,,,,

So my question is, how did this theory come about? Simply from this dream from the Tower of Joy?

I halfheartedly wrote a joking story about the Fellowship vs 9 characters from GoT. Got a few PM's from people really liking it, so I decided to elaborate more and write a slightly more detailed story with a few changes. 

As Gimli sobs over the tomb of Balin, the rest of the fellowship watches solemnly. Suddenly, the room begins to hum with a mysterious energy. Gandalf's eyes widen as nine figures materialize on the other side of the room. ""What magic is this?"" whispers Legolas. ""The work of Sauron, no doubt."" Gandalf replies. 

On the opposite side of the room, Melisandre of Asshai, Eddard Stark,  Jaime Lannister, the Clegane brothers, Barristan Selmy, Khal Drogo, Jon Snow and his direwolf, Ghost appear. They all look at each other, with stunned looks on their faces. Jon rushes towards his father and embraces him. 

""I...I thought you were dead!"" exclaims Jon. ""I was. I don't understand what manner of sorcery is at work here"" his voice trails off as he scans his companions. Jaime feels at his regrown hand, and pulls his sword with his rightful hand, immediately overcome by a wave of bliss. He locks eyes with Eddard and feels his hand go cold immediately. 

Sandor and Gregor Clegane pull their swords on one another, when Melisandre speaks up.  ""Let us not fight amongst ourselves. The lord of light has brought us all back for the final battle. Our enemies are in this very room."" her voice echoes throughout the room, gaining in volume as she speaks. ""Let us put the quarrels of our houses behind us, as R'hllor wills it. You should all feel honored to be chosen as his champions."" 

And as simple as that, the men of Westeros turn their blades towards the Fellowship. ""Half their company is full of dwarves. Perhaps R'hllor would have been better taking my brother."" quips Jaime. ""It is not uncommon for the Other to employ such monsters in his army. Do not take them lightly. The night is dark and full of terrors."" 

Both sides stared each other down intensely, waiting for the other to make the first move. ""Bugger this waiting, let's get this over with so we can go back to killing each other"" spat the Hound. Khal Drogo was the first to move, he unsheathed his Arakh, let out a Dothraki battle cry, and charged across the room, quickly followed by the others.

 Legolas releases his arrow, striking Gregor Clegane in the shoulder. The mountain shrugs it off and charges at the group of hobbits. Merry manages to dodge the Clegane's greatsword, but Pippin was not as lucky. Sam screams as he watches Clegane cleave Pippin clean in two. ""That was my friend!"" yells Merry, rebounding off a rock and jumping at Gregor, only to be caught by the throat. Merry kicked futilely at the giant's stomach, but there was little he could do. Clegane's grip tightened around the hobbit's throat, and the last thing Merry ever heard was a sinister laugh coming from underneath the black helmet of Gregor Clegane. The last thing Gregor heard was the *whish* of the arrow as it passed through his steel helm as smoothly as a knife through water. 

Sandor's eyes grew wide with anger as his brother fell. He charged towards the elf ""No one kills my brother but me!"" he yelled, tackling Legolas to the ground. The elf deftly slipped from under him, and leapt onto the tomb. Before he could notch another arrow, Clegane was upon him once more. 

Barristan Selmy and Boromir circled each other, swords pointed, each adamantly studying the other. Barristan struck first, but Boromir parried it effortlessly. He swung a few more times; overhead, underneath, stab, all parried. *This one is skilled* he thought to himself. 

Gimli swung his axe at Jon Snow, who leapt back just in the nick of time. He retaliated with a flurry of blows with Longclaw. The dwarf deflected the first few swings with his axe, but the fourth one tangled up under the muzzle of the axe. The bastard kicked Gimli in the face, knocking his axe out of his hands and him to the ground. Jon raised Longclaw to deliver the killing blow, but before he could swing, his head fell to the ground courtesy of Andril. ""Ghost..."" he squeaked with his final breath. 

Ghost let out a howl that reverberated off the walls of the tomb and leapt upon Gimli's body, tearing the dwarfs throat out in one vicious movement. He looked up, his muzzle dripping with blood. He spotted a pair of dwarves attempting to find a way out of the room and charged them, only to be obliterated by a bolt of lightning. All that remained of the Direwolf was a pile of fur and blood. 

Ed Stark let out a ferocious roar, he hadn't been returned from the dead only to die again. He swung Ice at Gandalf's back, only to be met by Andril. The two greatswords locked into each other, the clash of Elven steel and Valyrian steel echoing off the walls. 

Boromir and Barristan Selmy continued their battle, although Boromir's youth was apparent. The old man grew tired, weak, and sloppy. One missed parry was all it took, and Barristans arm was lopped off, sword and all. He fell to his knees silently and looked up at Boromir. ""Go on then..."" he spat blood on the ground. ""Finish it."" Boromir obliged him.

Legolas continued to toy with The Hound. He hadn't the time or the space to reload his bow, but he had the agility down. If he could only get to one of the swords from one of the fallen. He leapt over the side of the tomb, quickly followed by Sandor Clegane. Sandor jumped over the tomb and looked around. Legolas has disappeared. He turned around and found himself staring at the point of an arrow. Before he could even groan, Legolas released the arrow. Legolas then saw Longclaw lying on the ground and made a leap for it. Right into Khal Drago's curved Arakh. The Dothraki eviscerated the elf violently. Legolas fell to the ground, clutching his entrails. 

""For the shire!"" came a shrill yell, and before Khal Drogo could react, Sting pierced him through the midsection. He let out a scream and fell on top of the elf's body, left to bleed out. 

Melisandre rushed over to Gregor Clegane's body and whispered a prayer. ""Oh Lord of light, this one is needed once more! Grant me the strength to bring him back from the dead!"" Gregor Clegane opened his eyes once more, and without a word of thanks rejoined the fray. 

Ice and Andril continued to clash, the two who should be king of their respective realms met each other blow for blow. Finally, Andril shattered against the Valyrian steel of Ice. Aragorn stepped back, shocked. As Ned Stark prepared to deliver the killing blow, Jaime Lannister snuck up behind Aragorn and opened his throat. The King of Gondor fell to the ground, blood pouring from his throat like a river. On this day, the Kingslayer unknowingly doubled up on his nickname. 

Gregor Clegane attacked the two remaining hobbits. Frodo ran, but was backed into a corner. As Gregor went to bring his greatsword down, the hobbit simply vanished as he slipped on the ring. He let out a confused grunt and turned around, looking for his prey. Frodo wasn't there, but Sam was. The Mountain slashed at the hobbit, sending his head flying across the room. 

Frodo screamed and slashed at the giant's ankles, cutting both of his achille's tendons with one swing. The Mountain fell to his knees, utterly bewildered by the events that have transpired in the past hour. Frodo plunged Sting into the back of Clegane and killed him a second time. 

Ned Stark and Boromir circled each other, both stuck with the unnerving feeling that they knew each other from somewhere. ""Winterfell!"" yelled Stark, ""Gondor!"" yelled Boromir, and they met in single combat. 

Jaime looked around at the remaining combatants. The battle was dwindling down. *What type of god sends five dwarves and a greybeard against the mightiest fighters of Westeros* he chuckled. All that remained of the enemy force was a dwarf and the greybeard. The only able fighter remaining was locked into f combat with Ned Stark. *Even from beyond the grave, Stark continues to claim all the glory* he grimaced *Very well then, someone has to do the rest of the work* Jaime walked over to Gandalf. ""If you lay down, I'll make it painless."" he scoffed. Gandalf turned around and pointed his staff at the Kingslayer. ""For Aragorn!"" he yelled. A massive bolt of lightning shot out at Jaime Lannister, and the Kingslayer was no more.

Meanwhile, Boromir fell to Ned Stark. It was not without a price though. Eddard clutched his chest, one of his lungs had been pierced. Melisandre rushed to his aid, cradling him in his arms as Gandalf approached. She could not match the power of this wizard, but she still had one thing. There were surely no Stone Dragons in this realm, but the power of Kingsblood had power wherever you went. 

Melisandre pulled out the jar of Wildfire. She had been saving it for when she was stuck in the depth of the night, and here she was. She shattered the jar of Wildfire on Ed Stark's dying body and took a step back. 

The entire tomb began to rumble and shake violently. Gandalf's eyes went wide with fear as a a massive beast of fire burst through the wall. Melisandre stared in awe as she dropped to one knee. ""Oh R'hllor! You have graced me with your presence. Your humble servant is yours to command!"" The Balrog advanced towards Gandalf, crushing the Red Witch beneath it's monstrous foot. 

Frodo escaped through the hole in the wall, clutching the ring tightly as the mines began to collapse. He ran back out the way they had entered only hours ago. Then there were 9, and now he was one. But they had won, at what cost though? 

**Winner: The Fellowship of the Ring** ^^Or ^^are ^^they? 

Frodo makes his way out of the mines as all of Khazad-Dum collapses into a massive pit of flame. He looks down remorsefully, having lost everyone. He turns around and finds himself face to face with a man his own height, albeit much more grotesque as if someone had taken a normal human and compressed it down. There was naught but a scar where his nose should have been. And he was holding a crossbow. Frodo felt the bolt pierce his chest and fell to the ground lifeless. 

Tyrion Lannister stepped over the body of the hobbit and searched him. He caught the glimmer of the golden ring around Frodo's neck. ""Well, I'm sure I could make use of this."" he yanked the ring off its chain and placed it snugly in his pocket.

I knew that Game of Thrones shot some scenes in Iceland, but it didn't really interest me at the time, so I didn't think much about set locations and the like. Until tonight, when I randomly wondered if I was ever close to any of the GoT sets. Turns out I was closer than I ever could have imagined. 

http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/ygrittes-rock-a-report-from-iceland/

I randomly stumbled upon this article about ""Ygritte's Rock"" and the photo's of the set share more than a few similarities to some of my own. 

Here are some of my photos:

As a new fan of the show, it's astounding to think that I randomly wandered onto the exact location of filming without any prior knowledge or indicators that GoT shot scenes there. The weirdest thing is that Svnafellsjkull was not an easy find, but about three miles down a random gravel road that happened bisect the road we were on. We went there because we saw the glaciers from the road and wanted to get a closer look. An amazing coincidence built upon a amazing adventure. Hope you all enjoyed this as much as I did. It's also crazy re-watching the show and recognizing the very landmarks I stood upon ignorantly, now adorning my television screen lol.",2,22,False,self,,,,,

I'd love to hear what everyone thinks. I'm doing a research report for university and I decided i'll do it on my favourite series, Game of Thrones of course!

The interview is 7 questions. You can be as detailed as you want to, ideally 4-5 sentences are okay. Thanks for taking a look!

Questions:

**Do you think women and men are equally and accurately represented? Why/why not?**

**Is there any flexibility in gender roles? How are gender role rebels such as the eunuch Varys, Arya Stark, and Samwell Tarly treated?**

**How are women represented in Game of Thrones compared to other shows? Are women more empowered or misrepresented?**

**What kind of qualities and traits does society expect from men, and from women?**

**Do you think sexuality is an issue in Game of Thrones? In what ways?**

**Do you think theres a balance in how gender roles are portrayed? How so?**

**Lastly, if you had to summarise 3 positive OR 3 negative aspects of men and women in Game of Thrones , what would they be?**

Feel free to include any general comments that might not fit into the questions. I extremely appreciate all of your help and answers. *REMEMBER* there are NO right or wrong answers! It's your perspective I want. Thank you!

In Harrenhal, Arya Stark is promised help by the mysterious Jaqen Hghar, one of the three caged prisoners during her trip to the Wall. After Renly's sudden death at the hands of Melisandre's shadowy assassin, Catelyn and Brienne are forced to flee from Renly's camp. Theon sails from Pyke prepared to prove that he is a true Ironborn, with plans to overtake Winterfell while Robb is out fighting the war. The Night's Watch arrive at an ancient fortress called the Fist of the First Men, where they intend to make a stand.|

461,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2013-12-10,2013,12,10,4,1shdqe,self.gameofthrones,"[Season 2 spoilers] I Just re-watched ""Valar Morghulis""(Ep2.10) and noticed a couple of discrepancies.. Am I Crazy??? Can Someone put this right for me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1shdqe/season_2_spoilers_i_just_rewatched_valar/,keithfuckingrichards,1386616397,"I had some time to kill last night, so I figured I'd re-watch one of my favorite episodes, ""Blackwater."" And after such a jolt of nostalgic awesomeness, I obviously couldn't NOT wrap things up and watch ""Valar Morghulis"" too. Both episodes were just as awesome as I had remembered and I was left feeling completely satisfied. Well uh.. *Almost* completely satisfied. 

For context, I became a fan of GoT just before the 3rd season aired, and binge-watched the first two seasons in probably ten days or so. Needless to say, as all the boobs and dwarves and tears whizzed by at warp speed, I had more than a few moments of confusion about the plot and characters, and r/gameofthrones was absolutley a *godsend* in such moments. 

Anyway, I like to think I'm a fairly sharp guy and that I have a pretty firm grasp on the themes and plotlines so far (TV-Wise anyway, I have yet to read the books), which has given me an immense appreciation for the great strength, subtlety and range we see in the storytelling and worldbuilding (from the showrunners as well as GRRM himself.) Most shows, even the ones we really, really like will have *some* sort of continuity stumbles or minor contradictions or whatever; It's not a big deal, we can gloss over and suspend disbelief for a few seconds because we love the show. So having seen three seasons of GoT so far I was (and continue to be) wowed by the lack of even the smallest such errors.

**BUT** after re-watching Valar Morghulis, I found that the final minutes of an otherwise magnificent season finale had left me scratching my head over two things that I'd managed to gloss over the first time around. Almost equally puzzling was the fact that I hadn't yet seen either of them mentioned in this subreddit. SO. Here they are:

**1. The Iron Islander's surrender/Burning of Winterfell**

Seems pretty straightforward right? Let's see..

* We are told that the 20 reluctant Ironborn soldiers in Winterfell are SURROUNDED by an ARMY of Northmen, presumably loyal to House Stark (Or at the very least House Bolton [Roose says his bastard is there], which for all intents and purposes means the same thing, assuming most men of the North, even those shady Bolton guys, like the Starks more than they like foreigners invading their land, regardless of where they may fall on the true and tested *we-luv-the-starks/Ned-is-literally-adolf-hitler's-dad* political spectrum)

* We are then told that the *ursupers*, the *rebellious*, *treasonous*, ***stinky*** Iron Islanders will be given safe passage from Winterfell back home, all they have to do is hand over Theon, that derpy, misfit of a rich kid who they don't really have any interest in dying for. Duh! No brainer right?! Iron Islanders go home safely, Robb gets the traitor, The Greyjoy rebellion and siege of Winterfell is over before it even begins! Huzzah! Everyone wins!!!!11!!!1!! *Incredible!* Can you believe it? EVERYONE!! *huh ^what's ^that ^^Theon? ^^I ^^^can't ^^^hear ^^^^you...*

* Wow I can't believe this worked out so well for everyone! Things around here never run this smoo**WAIT WINERFELL IS ON FIRE WHY IS WINTERFELL ON FIRE**

So here I am with a million questions and I'm grasping and grasping aaaaannd I can't think of any logical explainations.

The big one is: **WHO set Winterfell on fire????** We know that the tradeoff with Theon went down; We don't actually *see* it happen, but we do see him get knocked out, and then later [S3](#s ""wake up with Mr. Hornblower himself""), so i think we can safely assume the drop went smoothly. Also [S3](#s ""I kind of vaguely remember sometime in season 3 we see his ex-posse back in Pyke and his sister gets mad/disappionted/disgusted/has some sort of reaction at them for deserting him. Did that happen or am I just misremembering?"") Anyway, I digress..

If the Ironborn gave up Theon and the Northerners let them go (remember they're **SURROUNDED**), at what point does Winterfell go up in Flames? 

I feel like it is *kinda* (maybe) implied that in the scene when they knock out Theon their collective attitude is more or less ""Alrighty boys, fuck it let's get outta this dump and go home"", a sentiment that is nicely illustrated shortly thereafter by killing Luwin just 'cuz. 

I guess the first time I saw the scene I processed it as ""Ok these big mean manly sailor guys are in control of the city and in kill/rape/pillage viking mode so duh they burned Winterfell, why wouldn't they?"" But when I actually thought about the logistics of the situation... how would that happen? There's an ARMY of guys who have the bad guys surrounded and want to kill them, and the *only* thing preventing that from happening is the word of the king saying to let them go once they have the desired hostage. 

So did the Ironborn burn the city and then walk out of the gates, columns of smoke going up behind them, sheepishly grinning at the army of guys who could easily and happily kill them (especially now that they have Theon and *especially* given that it's not like Robb was ever gonna have his secretary check in with the Salty Seadog Beaurau over in Pyke to make sure those guys got home safely), then give them Theon and walk off scott free, patting themselves on the back? 

Did they give up Theon first to make sure they were safe, then go back inside and burn it and *then* come back out and strut past the army and off into the sunset? 

Also... I dunno about the books, but in the show, we are never really presented (that I remember) with a wide shot or bird's-eye view of Winterfell that gives us a good sense of its size and scale the way we are with King's Landing, Harrenhall, etc.. but assuming that since it is a capital city (Albeit one in the North, which probably has lower population density), there must be at least a few thousand people living there, so how does a group of 20 guys burn down an entire city? In such a timely manner? *When 99% of the buildings are made of STONE*? 

And the PEOPLE! Where are they during all of this? It seems completely deserted. I get that you should stay indoors and stuff and not risk getting killed if your city is being occupied, but hey! You are the 99 percent! \#occupythenorth ! It's 20 unspectacular, unmotivated dudes vs a whole city! I know all the toughest guys are off with Robb but c'mon.. ^it's.. ^like ^^20 ^^dudes.. even if the 5-year-olds outnumber them 25-1, I like those odds! I thought this was the *North*! I thought the folks were cut from a different cloth up here! Those Southerners might not know much about winter but I bet they wouldn't let just *any* 20 shmucks take, hold *and* sack King's Landing! And why didn't they try to put out the fires or at least prevent the spread? Where did they all go??? Is Winterfell just an abandoned ruin now?

So. If the Ironborn were indeed the perpatrators.. *why* would the army let them get away with doing such a thing? Did.. did the army burn down their *OWN* Capital City? Did Maester Luwin's corpse spontaneously combust? Was Rickon using the stove again without ~~parental~~ ~~adult~~ Hodor supervision? NONE OF THESE SCENARIOS MAKE SENSE TO ME GIVEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEAD TO BELIEVE THUSFAR IN THE STORY, NEVERMIND WHAT COMMON SENSE AND RATIONALITY MIGHT DICTATE

WHAT HAPPENED HERE??

**2. Sam vs Iggy Popsicle** ^((and friends)^)

This one doesn't get me *as* worked up... but come on.. can someone please give me a reasonable explanation of [S3](#s ""how the hell he got out of there alive?"")

It was a great cliffhanger.. the ominous music, the shapes slowly materializing from the swirling snow and then oh shit! There are thousands upon fucking *thousands* of wights all around him!

Now had it been this *alone*, I may have been able to suspend disbelief. It hasn't been discussed much on the show, so it's a kind of a grey area, but the wights seem to be similar to 'The Walking Dead' type zombies: used to be humans, no longer self aware, kinda clumsy, followers not leaders. Just slightly more organized, dangerous and generally less silly on this show (they can march in the same direction and have weapons and stuff). 

Plus, he is somewhat hidden, and they are all behind him (as opposed to surrounding him). Things are actually not so bad! The White Walkers are the only ones you really have to worry about.. They want nothing more than to exterminate the human race in its entirety, and cause as much pain and suffering as they can manage on their little quest for world domination. But *these guys* are just your run-of-the-mill wights, dumb sumbitches just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and now they're forever undead. No biggie. All's he needs is a couple basic anti-zombie evasive manuevers and he's right back with his best buds, scoopin' poop for that pellet stove they have back at camp. Just stop, drop and roll, a light jog (although since he literally *just* demonstrated that he'd probably lose to ***Bran*** in a footrace, that might be out the window), don't make too much noise, and you're in the clear baby!

Nice! Fuck yeah Sa-**Oh**

Oh *Fuck.*

*There's a white walker.* Guys. Guys there's..there's a white walker right next to him

Welllll he's made it this far, with any luck it probably won't even notice h***SHIT***

*It looked right at him. And then it screamed.* welp... that's it folks. Pack it up. RIP in peace

BUT THEN [S3](#s ""HE LIVES!"") HOW?

Assuming he stays put, (since none of the freaky shit he's seen to this point gets him to run, it'll probably take nothing short of 100 horse-sized turduckens for him to budge) how can he have any possible hope of survival? It's been reiterated over and over again that White Walkers are the worst of the worst of the worst.. like.. Voldemort meets Katie Couric levels of bad. Why would [S3](#s ""they intentionally ignore him?"") And at least *one* of [S3](#s ""those wights is going to notice/smell/hear him if they all walk past.. I don't care how dumb they are."") C'MON!

Someone please explain these things to me!! Perhaps these are both cases where they are better expanded upon and clarified to some logical degree in the books? Did I miss some glaringly obvious detail in the show? I've picked through the original post-episode discussion thread *and* the re-watch thread. I've been subbed here for like a year and have never seen any substantial discussion here on either of these discrepancies. 

AM I JUST TAKING CRAZY PILLS OVER HERE???? *What happened??* Help me out people!!!

I believe that Daenerys Targaryen will save Westeros for some reasons. Now my facts could be off but...

1. The Dragonglass was used by Samwell Tarly to kill a White Walker
2. Dragonglass is made by dragons
3. Daenerys Targaryen has 3 dragons
4. Daenerys Targaryen is on her way to Westeros
_____
5. She could arrive in time to defend Westeros from the White Walkers with her dragons
6. She will become Queen of Westeros.

I've been thinking about Jon Connington, and I've got three in my head.

[Kevin Mckidd](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571727/) is a popular choice, and I think he'd be great. He's high profile, and there were those comments regarding not working with HBO due to the cancellation of *Rome*, but it was supposedly just jesting. 

[Damian Lewis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507073/)is one I haven't really seen thrown around at all on forums. Probably because he's obviously extremely involved in Homeland, but I loved him in Band of Brothers and from what I've seen of Homeland as well, so he'd be a fun choice. 

[Liam Neeson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/) lacks Griff's red hair, but who wouldn't want to see Liam Neeson in the show? His bad-ass factor means I'd accept him in pretty much any damn role (Penny the dwarf, anyone?)

It seems like some of the storylines trailed behind, while some of them rocketed way too far ahead.

Arya- She only has two chapters they didn't cover yet- one where nothing really happens (more traveling with the Hound), and another where they can probably make 2/3 episodes out of- the inn where the Hound is injured, her escape, and her finding the ship.

Bran- They've already finished up his ASOS story... I have no idea what they're planning for him in S4.

Stannis- In ASOS, after Stannis receives the letter, the next time he shows up is at the Wall, and that episode has been confirmed for ep9. Will we get no Stannis for 8 episodes?

Daenerys- I feel like they could get 10 episodes out of the Meereen business, but it might be disappointing. She gets the city pretty slyly, not much action, and then sits there for one chapter.",29,11,False,default,,,,,

The article suggests, however, that ""the Martells abandon[ed] many of their older Andal customs in favor of those of the Rhoynar. Specifically, they began to call their rulers 'princes' instead of kings, and their lands and title passed down to the eldest child regardless of gender.""

It has been confirmed that S4E9 will be called ""castle Black"". This obviously means that this episode will feature the Battle at the Wall, and probably end with a close out of ""Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!""

S4E10 will probably include Tyrion's escape and Tywin's death, as well as ""Only Cat"" and perhaps close out with Stoneheart, just like in the books.

This is some of my speculation, but what do you think? Particularly:

When will the Purple Wedding happen?

When will Arya make it to braavos?

When/If will bran will meet the Greenseer?

When will the Viper vs Mountain happen?

Alright, so is it pretty commonly accepted that Pate in the prologue to AFFC is killed by a faceless man (Probably Jaqen given the facial description matches exactly to what was given of earlier)? I remember being unsure what happened to him after his meeting with the alchemist when he just collapses in the street. But I'm pretty sure that is cleared up in ADWD when Arya assassinates the insurance salesman. From what I can gather both Pate and the salesman are killed by poisoned coins. 

Relevant text below: 

AFFC Pate: **""Pate grabbed it from his hand. The gold felt warm against his palm. He brought it to his mouth and bit down on it the way hed seen men do. If truth be told, he wasnt sure what gold should taste like, but he did not want to look a fool.""**

ADWD Old Insurance Guy: **""The old man would count it out carefully, sorting the coins and stacking them up neatly, like with like. He never looked at the coins. Instead he bit them, always on the left side of his mouth, where he still had all his teeth""**

ADWD Old Insurance Guy: **""And with that coin and the others in his purse, he paid a certain man. Soon after that man's heart gave out. Is that the way of it? Very sad.""**

I had to read back and make sure Pate had bitten down on his dragon to make sure the connection I had made was correct the first time. 

Any theories on why a faceless man wanted the key that Pate stole? I have a feeling that it has something to do with a book I think Sam or someone had mentioned earlier about dragons. Or maybe it was Tyrion? Can't really remember but I have heard that Euron may have offed Balon via Faceless man as well receiving a Dragon's egg as payment. So maybe the Faceless men are attempting to hatch a dragon? Idk in truth... so let the theories fly if you have one... I want to hear it!

Does anyone have a better copy of that wallpaper? I would love to finish the collection so I can configure Windows to cycle through them every x minutes.

It was disgusting, full of gore, indignifying but good, not because a character that i hated died in a disgusting way but because it showed me how death should never be satisfying, it should never what you should ask for..

It was as if GRRM slapped me and told me that i won't and shouldn't like everything that i ask for and what i really hope is that the show doesn't make Purple wedding a joke or some sort of revenge-fantasy getting resolved or just pure entertainment.. (Same thing with Tyrion, just staring at dying Joff and doing nothing, trying nothing and having no shred of sympathy for Joff, yet is still not enjoying it since Joff is just a kid after all)

That character development for Tyrion shouldn't be leftout or changed too much since it kind of made Tyrion's actions make more sense, in a way..

I'm currently a fashion student aspiring to be a film/tv costume designer. I have the tendency to pick up personal projects aside from my school work and thought to myself ""what would be a good project to do?"". And then it hit me!

Designing and making my own takes on Game of Thrones costumes! Sewing and Game of Thrones, I think it's a great combo!

So I decided to share with this awesome community! I'll be taking inspiration from both the show and the books. I was thinking you guys could make suggestions as to which character I should design for first (and which outfit/setting). I want to keep it to the lady characters first since mens' wear is tricky.

So any suggestions as to who should get costumed first? Also I want to make several designs for each character and maybe have you guys vote on which one you like the best!

I personally think they're going to save Ygritte's death for the battle at the wall with Stannis- maybe to add some grief to what is mostly an uncharacteristically triumphant event for the ""good guys""
Also, given the casting of Tycho Nestoris I definitely see them writing in some scenes between him and Stannis
Other Predictions:
Jorah tries to kill Daario out of jealousy which eventually leads to him inadvertently revealing his earlier betrayal
Arya's abandonment of the Hound will be much more sympathetic than that in the books, maybe he encourages her to leave him to find safety from attackers?

There is quite a bit of discussion about it here: http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/57070-population-of-westeros/

In the above discussion it mentions that Elio Garcia, who is co-writing a book on the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, has postulated that the population of Westeros is about 40 million. There is some further information at http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Westeros

&gt; The population of the Seven Kingdoms has never been measured. The populations of the major cities have been estimated:
&gt; 
&gt; * King's Landing: 500,000.
&gt; * Oldtown: 500,000.
&gt; * Lannisport: 300,000.
&gt; * Gulltown &amp; White Harbor: several tens of thousands.

While trying to figure out the individual city sizes I have used the following template:

    Massive		400,000 - 600,000
    Huge		200,000 - 400,000
    Large		50,000  - 100,000
    Medium		10,000  - 50,000
    Small		1,000   - 10,000
    Tiny		&lt;1,000
    None		0

But the above is just a guess and I'm happy to hear suggestions about how it could be altered. I took the above and ran it through some code along with the different cities/towns/holdfasts in Westeros. I made many, *many* guesses about the size/population of each city/town/holdfast, and that's what I need help with. This might require a ridiculously encyclopaedic knowledge of the books, which I don't have, but I hope there are some people here who can help. Oh, and I accept that the actual size is going to be elastic and not set in stone. It's not possible to get the populations of the individual cities/towns/holdfasts to equal the 40 million suggestion, so I'll take it to mean that there are other areas not yet explored in the books or that much of the population lives in rural areas.

Princess Myrcella is sent away from King's Landing. Theon Greyjoy's plans to take Winterfell succeed as he continues to try to prove his Ironborn status. Robb reunites with the healer Talisa. At the Fist of the First Men, the ranger Qhorin Halfhand gives Jon Snow the opportunity to prove his worth. While out on patrol, Jon takes prisoner a Wildling named Ygritte. Joffrey incites a riot at King's Landing. At Qarth, Daenerys tries to procure a ship to take her people to Westeros. Taken in by Tywin Lannister, Arya attempts to hide that she is Ned Stark's daughter, as Jaqen H'ghar helps her conceal her identity. Robb receives news of Theon's plans and sends men to retake Winterfell, while inside the city there are plans to get Bran and Rickon out. Daenerys' dragons are stolen.|

In about 72 hours, I go in for knee surgery and will be off my feet for all of break. I'm going to have a lot of time on my hands. Presumably I finish ASOS very soon. I have been told by friends that AFFC and ADWD happen concurrently just for different characters. Is it worth it to take the two books together at the same time and just read them piecemeal (say 4 chapters of each at a time)?? Or is it suggested that I just read AFFC then ADWD afterwards.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the advice!

**Angry Young Man**

- Refusing to bend, refusing to crawl

- Surviving is a noble fight

- Our honor is pure, and our courage as well 

- Fair and true

- Proud of our scars and battles lost

**I Go To Extremes**

- Clear as crystal, sharp as a knife

- All or nothing at all

- Out of the darkness, into the light

- Eager to please, ready to fight

**The Stranger**

- Satin and steel

- Silk and leather

- The face of the stranger

- We disregard the danger

- The stranger never seen

- Never afraid to try again

- You will never quench our fire

**River of Dreams**

- From the mountains of faith

- Through the valley of fear

- Through the desert of truth

- Only seen by the blind eye

- We all end in the ocean

(Need Help, Thanks)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1t6ycj/all_spoilers_lots_of_general_questions_about/,sansabaelish,1387398835,"1. Did Stannis mean for Renly to be killed by the red priestess or did he think she would do something less... lethal? The reason I ask is I thought the show made it seem like he didn't know, then he shows sort of regret for what happened.

2. Why didn't tyrion just use all of the thousands of wildfire pots across the sea so the rest wouldn't just be sitting under King's Landing? If this would have caused huge environmental damage, still, why not place them somewhere else more safe to the kingdom rather than just keep the unused pots in their original location, dangerously close where some accident could happen to the kingdom?

3. How did Dany know she killed the correct Warlock illusion in the House of the Undying? Couldn't he just be faking? Was that just a child warlock in season 3 that tried to assassinate her or was it a disguise or apprentice of some sort of the original warlock in the previous season?

4. Why would that Quarth guy that tried to marry Dany go through the trouble to build a sealed vault with nothing in it just to lure Dany to marry him and get her dragons? Did he just want to get her dragons then kill her once she agreed to marry him? Did he already take the riches from the vault and hang that lock around his neck as a ruse? Didn't he have it on his neck even before Dany came to Quarth? If so who was he trying to trick then? Or did he not know there was anything in it and was just ignorant towards it all along? If so why didn't he use it to check beforehand?

5. What happened to the Illyrio guy in Season 3 I don't remember seeing him? Also, when Varys says he's ""doing what he thinks is good for the realm"" in the Chaos speech to Peter, is he simply saying vaguely that he is helping Dany come to Westeros? I guess what I mean is, is Peter playing the game for himself and Varys playing the game for the Targaryens?

6. Stupid unrelated GOT question and general anatomy question but knowing GRRM, does he ever explain how Eunuch's urinate at all? I doubt the sorcerer that cut Varys did so with surgical precision that allowed everything to work great down there.

7. Maybe I was sleeping at this part but where did Arya's direwolf go?

8. When the night's watch talk about white walkers are they talking about the guys with ice weapons that look like the leaders (along with the wight zombie guys) or just the ice weapon leader looking guys? I guess what I mean is are they considered two seperate entities or all just white walkers? Sorry for my horrible nomenclature, I am a simple newb at the show.

9. When Roose tells Walder that Robb ignored his advice at every turn, is this the reason he betrays him, or did he intend on betraying him before he started even fighting for him? If Robb listened to him would Roose still be fighting for Robb?

10. Where did Lancel go in Season 3? I know he was hurt at blackwater but was he simply not doing anything in the book at this time or was his story not even relevant right now?

11. Maybe I am completely forgetting something but wasn't Dany having a difficult time finding ONE ship for her and the remaining Dothraki? How the heck is she going to find all those ships for the Unsullied and the other army members that she'll probably get from the slaves she frees?

12. Was the Dagger from season 1 really Littlefinger's and was he in cahoots with Cersei or was this purely Cersei and Jaime's idea to send the assassin? What was the reason Littlefinger implicated Tyrion in the crime? What did he stand to gain from implicating him instead of another lannister of higher standing?

13. Did the show makers state the purpose of the show not utilizing flashbacks at all so the show watcher's understand how important people like Prince Rhaegar and Howland Reed and Jon Arryn were? I remember completely forgetting some of the people when re-watching the show and having to look them up or look up what they exactly did. Wouldn't it be wise to actually show Robert killing Rhaegar or the Tower of Joy scene?

14. How many different ""religious institutions"" are there? I hear stuff about old gods, new gods, drowned god, lord of light, etc. When did old gods become old and new god worshipers split from old gods worshipers? Also how the heck do the people like the hound and Arya or even the Mountain who had to kill Beric not lose their minds and automatically bow down to the lord of light when they see someone like Beric survive mortal wounds like he did?

I guess that's it for now, thanks!",16,7,False,self,,,,,

I've decided, ""Why don't I start making/selling cyvasse boards?"", so I am asking the fans of the series if there would be a viable market for this game. I would hand make the boards and pieces (or get someone to help me) out of wood or, if specifically asked, stone. But once again, is it worth it?

Epic. Sweet! Mysha! Crowdsurfing! Happy happy times had by all in Yunkai!

Scene fades to black. Silence for a second. We hear trickling water, scene slowly fades in to show a wide, powerful, yet peaceful river flowing. Looks familiar, not sure though. Whatevs. This is pretty.

We see some broken arrows float by, pieces of wood, debris here and there. That's odd. Then a body floats by face down. Camera cuts away to some trees rustling near the shore of the river. It's a pack of rabid dogs. But...one of them is *gigantic*! Tafuc?? Why is that one so big?! Is that...is that a....?

The direwolf runs to the shore as the body is floating by. Sad puppy whimpers, direwolf is pacing frantically, waiting for the body to near. It jumps into the water and snags it with it's teeth, dragging it back to shore. The other wolves are standing back, clearly the direwolf is the head of their pack, and is distraught. The wolf rolls the body over so it's laying on it's back and is licking it's face, pushing the body with it's nose, begging it to wake up, to live. We can't see who it is yet...

Camera cuts to a band of scraggly men walking merrily down the road, singing and shooting the shit and such. The homeless looking drunkard at the head of the group stops them and motions for silence. They can hear the wolves nearby. O hai Brotherhood Without Banners.

They look through the trees and see the wolves, who growl and bare their teeth until Beric Dondarrion gives them a ""are you fucking kidding me?"" look, and they scamper away. The direwolf is still standing over the corpse, and catches Beric's eye (singular, of course). They share a glance, epic sadness in the direwolfs eyes. No fear in Beri's eye. The direwolf scampers away.

Beric approaches the body slowly, kneels down over it and looks back to the rest of the Brotherhood.  It's lifeless, cold, wet, hair is half gone and stringy and gray. It's female...dressed in nice garb, almost as if prepared for a fancy occassion. A feast maybe? Or a wedding? Thoros of Myr approaches and has a look at the body.

The womans throat is slit wide open, her wound cleaned out by the river, exposing a gaping slash. Her face is gashed around her eyes, her skin limp and soggy from floating in the river. Wrinkles all over. Super pruny...gahross. Mostly unrecognizable...mostly.

Beric and Thoros realize who they're looking at, their eyes grow wide with fear and sorrow. Beric looks frantically over her body one last time, then stands up and nods at Thoros. They exchange a close embrace. Beric kneels down over the body again and holds her head in his lap. He begins mumbling in high Valyrian and looking in to the sky. What's happening?! He looks down at the body once more, moving his face close to the corpses. He takes in a deep inhale and lightly kisses her lips.

*(lightly in the background) buh buh buh da daa duhhh da da daa duhh*

Lifeless, Beric slouches over and falls backwards on to the ground. The womans head slides off of his lap on the ground. Camera affixes on just the womans eyes.

*(a little louder now) buh da daa duhh buh da daa duhh*

Catelyn Stark's eyes shoot open instantly and she pulls in a frightening gasp, sickly sounding and raspy from the gash in her throat. 

*(music still building louder, faster) buh da daa dahh duh da duhh duhh*

Her eyes are awash in fear for an instant as she stares into the camera...then we see rage take over as her eyes narrow and the camera slowly pans out.

*(music moar loud, end of the theme song now) buh da duhh duh buh duh*

Camera cuts to black. Credits.

It's hard for me to imagine waiting between episodes or seasons when every episode left me wanting to know what happened next (especially endings with Daenerys). However, I feel like I missed out on a bonding experience with fellow fans; nevertheless, I'm now officially subscribed to this subreddit. I must now join you in waiting for new material, too.

Rory: ""Yeah..... You were gonna play... the... you were gonna play... my brother?""

The similarities being fairly obvious:

- Aristocratic families that are competing to stay a top the mountain.

- Both born premature, sickly, and handicapped 

- Both took to history and books very early and have deep love of reading.

- Each is a praised orator who is capable of making quality arguments. 

- Jaime is Germanicus, a skilled, handsome warrior who has a soft spot for his younger brother. 

- Cersei is Livilla, a cruel, beautiful woman who is not afraid of manipulating others and despises her younger brother. Also they each have prophetic events that say they will die early.

- Both are forced to marry hilariously taller woman for political purposes after losing their true loves.

- My favorite, Joffrey is Caligula, an insane King who dislikes his uncle and takes any chance to humiliate him.

Im sure there are more similarities I haven't mentioned and even some subtler ones a keener eye would pick up, do you know any?

With this being said, I would not be surprised if Tyrion some how inherited more power than anyone thought he ever would :)

If any?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1tha2q/spoilers_all_what_will_season_4_draw_from_books/,GRVrush2112,1387744557,"As we all know season 3 covered most of ""A Storm of Swords"" and while there is still plenty to cover of that book in season 4, but we will get to that point, especially late in the season were for a few of the characters the show will have to jump into their AFFC and ADWD storylines, so what characters do you think that will happen to and how far into those stories do you think they will go? 


Let's get the safe characters out of the way.....  I think Jon/Sam, Tyrion (as well as all other Kings Landing characters), Sansa, Arya, and Davos/ Stannis will not go beyond their ASOS arcs, and all will have enough story to not have to break into books 4/5. But other than those characters we will have to dip into the other characters lost ASOS stories slightly..


So, let's get the biggest offender out of the way first.  That being Bran....  Sadly for him, and because he had only 4 chapters in all of ASOS and he has reached the point where he is at by the end of ASOS already.  Add to the fact that ..[Season 4 casting spoilers](#s ""Leaf and Bloodraven/TEC have been cast"") .. means we will delve far into his story for ADWD in season 4.  This is gonna create further problems going into later seasons as Bran has even fewer chapters in ADWD..


Next on the list is an odd one... The Greyjoys.   I don't think we will actually get any Kingsmoot material, and as far as I'm aware none of the new AFFC characters have been cast for season 4.  But it seems from the end of season 3 that a completely fabricated ""rescue Theon"" plot line is going to be added for season 4, which will allow the producers to avoid getting to the AFFC material too quickly.  So I'm cool with that, and it keeps those characters relevant.  This could keep Theon/reek occupied as well without having to jump into his ADWD chapters yet either.


Brienne is next.  I think the writers can keep her in Kings Landing for a while, as she has to be at least until Sansa goes missing after the PW, but she has to leave shortly after that and get into her AFFC material.  I think during the early season you could get some ""good conflict with Loras"" material... But eventually her and Pod will need to hit the road, before the end of Season 4.


Last is Danerys.... I think we will get a small bit of her ADWD material, but not much... Most of her season I predict will deal with a buildup to Jorah's eventual dismissal and being discovered he was a spy for Robert.  I think she will arrive and take Mereen by episode 7/8, dismiss Jorah and decide to stay in episode 8/9.  And that's where Dany ends her book 3 story.  I however think with this bittersweet takeover in Mereen that it would be perfect to cap her season off with her first ADWD chapter and have her first session of court end that Drogon killed a child.  A good counter balance to her happy end to season 3.



Those are my thoughts, and a good way to start touching into book 4/5 material without getting too far.  Let me know what your thoughts are... Thanks for reading. ",40,33,False,self,,,,,

Theon tries to track Bran and Rickon with hounds. After an assassination attempt, Tywin Lannister begins searching Harrenhal for his potential murderer. Ygritte continues her attempts to seduce Jon and, after a momentary lapse in Jon's concentration, she escapes and leads him into a trap. Still shaken from the riot, Sansa is horrified when she awakens to find that she has had her first period, and can thus bear Joffrey's children. In Robb's camp, a failed escape attempt by Jaime leaves a guard dead, and Catelyn worries about the camp's desire for retribution. In Qarth, the warlock Pyat Pree reveals to Daenerys that he stole her dragons, but gives her the opportunity to reunite with them before slaughtering the Council of Thirteen and establishing Xaro Xhoan Daxos as king of Qarth.|

Largely even the end of these novels seem lacking in events that make for exciting television viewing. I liked both books though dont get me wrong.

Doran's and Manderly's reveal? The death at the wall? the dragon pit? What do you suppose is gonna be the way they take? If both books were just one season i could see this working. If they are both split roughly in half and the full storyline made into 2 seasons however, what do you suppose will be saved for the amazing episode 9 of season 5?",52,7,False,self,,,,,

I just took into account major events:

Episode 1: Introduction of Martells at KL, Sansa meets ser dontos, plans escape, balon is killed

Episode 2: Purple Wedding, Sansa escapes, tyrion arrested

Episode 3: Dany arrives at mereen, brienne and pod go after sansa

Episode 4: first battle at wall, ygritte killed, kingsguard tower scene with jaime

Episode 5: encounter at the inn, champion duel at mereen

Episode 6: Sansa arrives at eyrie, arya passes by eyrie at the same time

Episode 7: oberyn volunteers, bran meets 3 eyed crow and leaf

Episode 8: oberyn v mountain, tyrion escapes, tywin and shae killed

Episode 9: i think this will be a blackwater type episode where the whole thing is set at the battle at the wall, stannis arrives (i personally think it would be cool if they dont show stannis all season until this point, but that probably wont happen)

Episode 10: dany holds court for first time and learns drogon killed a child, jon snow becomes lord commander, arya leaves for braavos, sam and gilly and baby leave for citadel, only cat, lady stoneheart reveal

There will obviously be parts of tyrion's trial sprinkled throughout the season, as well as bran's adventures north of the wall. i'm definitely forgetting some things as i just came up with this off the top of my head

Feel free to comment with things you'd move around. I want to try and get a version as accurate as possible before the season starts. ",7,1,False,self,,,,,

But I feel like Westeros gets all the attention :( 

In rest of the books does the content on Essos start to balance out with the amount of Westeros content?

My method of consumption has been read a book, then watch the season. 

Unfortunately, things are starting to diverge. The book is ahead of the show in some places and vice-versa. Also, it would seem to be very exciting to be able to watch season 4 with my friends not knowing what is going to happen. 

**So I am turning to reddit with a great question. Do I:**

A) Plow forward and read the rest of book 3 + book 4, and then watch season 4

or 

B) Finish book 3 and wait for season 4

or

C) Something else

Here's where I am:

Show: Through Season 3, episode 4

Book: 800 pages into A Storm of Swords (book 3)

Do you think that at the end Season 4 when Tyrion kills Tywin, we'll see him shit himself like in the books? The reason I ask is because, while Tywin shitting himself isn't *entirely* necessary, the end of that chapter in the book was so well written that I'd hate to see it get cut.

""But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was just another lie.

Lord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold.""

They're ofcourse in my native language (swedish) right now and i feel like i'm so used to all the names, places, descriptions etc. to be in english from the TV show that i'm having trouble getting into it, not to mention i myself think alot of swedish words and expressions just sound silly. I'm pretty good at english so i don't think i'd have any issues with it but with the amount of places and characters to remember it might make it to much.

There is also the fact that there was a typo on the first page which for me is an instant red flag on the quality of the translation, will there be more of this? Will it bug me?

So basically, Redditors who read the books, should i stick with my own language to make sure i can follow or should i switch to english for a fully immersive experience?",13,6,False,self,,,,,

Now to the subject at hand. I've never been an avid reader and I'll confess that before the show I had never even heard of the ASOIAF series. I'm now on AFFC part 1, I would just like to acknowledge the difference I found in major turns of events in the book where everything's kooshty in one sentence and in the next there's itty bitty pieces of skull in the back of the car, apologies if this is just tediously obvious, but it really is amazingly written and delivers the shock tactic it intends with force... but I knew every spoiler coming until ASOS part 2, so I never really felt the effect of it. That is, until Oberyn Motherfucking Red Viper Martell was JUST ABOUT to move Mountains and what does he Fucking do!? Something I wouldn't fucking do and I've been in one fight in my life which was near a Tesco outside school which I lost! I'm still fucking pissed, For his short appearance I grew more attached to him than I did poor old dead Ned. I had to vent somewhere. He should have finished him off guys. He shouldn't have fucked around. You don't get up close and personal with a guy who makes you look like a fucking awesome, light armoured, light skinned version Gary Coleman. H-hold me...

Good thing I've got the books. 

I read on Wikipedia that the third season ends somewhere in the middle of the book and the fourth season starts somewhere in the middle of the book.

My question now is: Where would I start reading? Or would you recommend reading it from the beginning again? I mean, the dialogues are pretty much the same in the books and the tv show...

The exchange that takes place between Varys and Olenna revealed a ploy to betroth Sansa to Loras(Willas in the books I believe), in which Varys' motives being to stifle Littlefinger's ambitions, while Olenna's motives were what was led to be the same but in all probability were to secure the North under Tyrell banners. 

So here's what puzzles me. In the book, Littlefinger reveals to Sansa that *he* conspired with Olenna to have Joffrey poisoned. So either they have dramatically veered from the books on this, or Olenna is not the awesome, benevolent servant of the realm that I want her to be, and she's just another ruthless player in the game of thrones. I mean sure Joffrey is an evil cunt, but it certainly reveals her capacity to kill. Or I should just shut up and read the books.

1490,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2013-12-29,2013,12,29,7,1twkje,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers] Theory - The Spider and Littlefinger are the main characters of the story. (a breakdown of Ice and Fire),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1twkje/all_spoilers_theory_the_spider_and_littlefinger/,[deleted],1388271522,"so basically, the whole story boils down to the battle between ice and fire, right? theres the whole coming battle between the lord of light and the great other, and it seems like the armies are assembling. on the ice/darkness side, we have the ""good"" guys like Bran the Broken, Arya Ninja-Assassin, and Davos the Honorable Smuggler. on the fire/light side, we have ""bad"" guys like Lady Burns-People-Alive, Catelyn the Murder Machine, and Stannis Kills-His-Family.

and then we have varys and baelish, two guys who are involved in almost everything, yet arent pov characters. why? because they know EVERYTHING, and would ruin the surprise for everyone if we could see their thoughts. why do they know everything? because they are RESPONSIBLE for the whole shebang. which sides do they fall on?

my theory, varys is the big player on the ice side, and littlefinger is the big player on the fire side. we have fire, which is kind of like destruction, chaos, and rebirth. and we have ice, which is kind of like structure, preservation, and stasis.

varys, who has been labelled as an enemy of the realm, has been working in the shadows the whole time for the stability and preservation of the realm, and to protect it from destruction. hes been plotting to restore the targaryens, since people like Aegon and Dany would be better (and rightful) monarchs. hes been trying to facilitate compromises and deals to prevent and end conflicts. and he was helping the only person in kings landing who was trying to protect the people, tryion. to further the idea that varys is a figure of ice, he is the spymaster, ""seeing"" everything that happens throughout the world through the eyes of his spies, like the children see through the eyes of the heart trees.

also, he hates the fire god for burning his man parts.

on the other hand, we have littlefinger. while, on the surface, he appears to be working for the crown, hes secretly plotting to destroy the whole realm so he can claim the throne in the aftermath. its been said that he wants to watch the kingdom burn so he can rule over the ashes. unlike varys, who sits back, gathers information, and acts passively with behind the scenes schemes and stuff, littlefinger acts more like the red priestess, actively pursuing an agenda in the open, and asking for recognition and rewards for his successes.

the whole war is really a battle between these two for control over the destiny of the seven kingdoms. littlefinger started the war by having arryn killed and accusing the lannisters. varys tried to get the starks and lannisters to get along, while littlefinger fanned the flames until ned lost his head. varys has been working to end the war, while littlefinger has been trying to prolong it.

**tl;dr** the spider is on the side of ice (ice spiders, anyone?) littlefinger on the side of fire, and everyone else in the story is a chess piece that these two have been moving in a battle with each other.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

In the same scene, Rhaegar title drops the entire series, saying that the song of the Prince that was Promised is the Song of Ice and Fire. Maester Aemon Targaryen later proclaims that the gender of the Prince that was Promised is not defined by prophecy, naming Dany one of the heads and lamenting that he is unable to be one at his age.

My best guess at the three heads, the three Targaryen descendents related to or containing the Prince that Was Promised, before TWOW comes out anyway:

* **Daenerys Targaryen:** Confirmed Targaryen decedent, actually has dragons, and is one of the major POV characters in the series. Very much on the 'side' of Fire. 

* **The Last Greenseer/Bloodraven/Brynden Rivers the Great Bastard:** Another confirmed Targaryen. Melisandre sees representations of him and of Bran in a vision of her enemy. As Melisandre is a fire priestess, Bloodraven is placed on the side of Ice. This fits with his location north of the Wall. He is likely to pass his mantle on to Bran, fitting with GRRM's comment that the three heads need not ""be a Targaryen."" The head doesn't have to *be* a Targaryen, but the head *was* a Targaryen before the role was transferred on to another. Bran is another major POV character.

* **Jon Snow:** Heavily implied to be the son of Rheagar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Why would three of the Kingsguard be hanging around at The Tower of Joy while their king and prince were killed if not to protect the royal line? Lyanna was described as lying on a 'bloody bed', the same phrase that Mirri Maz Durr uses to describe childbirth. Jon is in a position as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch to be sandwiched between the North, winter, night, the Others, and his half brother Bran, and the South, summer, day, dragons, and his aunt Dany. Caught between other heads of the dragon that clearly owe allegiance to Ice or Fire, would his song be the Song of Ice and Fire?

This also fits if you take House Stark to be Winter/Ice and Targaryen to be Fire/Summer - Dany is fully Targaryen, Bran is fully Stark, and Jon Snow is half Stark and half Targaryen.

Robb Stark learns that his mother Catelyn has secretly freed Jaime Lannister, now escorted by Brienne of Tarth, in order to ransom her daughters Sansa and Arya; he also enters into a romantic relationship with Talisa. Yara Greyjoy arrives at Winterfell to bring Theon back to Pyke, after his botched attempt to recapture the Stark boys. Tywin Lannister leaves Harrenhal to attack Robb, which leads Arya Stark, Gendry and Hot Pie to attempt an escape with Jaqen H'ghar's help. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister attempts to blackmail Tyrion by abducting the prostitute, Ros, whom Cersei believes to be his secret lover. The capital prepares for assault by Stannis, who, underway to King's Landing, promises to make Davos Seaworth his Hand of the King. Beyond the Wall, the Wildling leader ""Rattleshirt"" leads the captured Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand to his king, Mance Rayder. In Qarth, Jorah Mormont agrees to accompany Daenerys into the House of the Undying to retrieve her dragons. |
