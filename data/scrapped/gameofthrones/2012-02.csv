I have played through many hours of survival mode, and built till I have grown sore of it.  What I want to do now is invest in a rather large project that will most likely take alot of time and effort. I am and avid Game of Thrones fan, and have decided to use this project to more or less create the world of Westeros.

What I am talking about is actually creating the geography of the world, and building the cities as accurately as I can. Now, this would not be a n exact one to one ratio world, as I do not want to make that many calculations. But, I will make the distances relatively alike to the book.

For an example, I think I am going to start out with Kings landing first. Once that is done to an accurate representation, I will move down the kingsroad, creating the structers and cities along it as I go.

What I really want to know is, would reddit appreciate this? I definitely want to show off my work as I go. A new installment would be put up every time I finish a major city or castle.
Another thing is, would it be better to start out in a flat world, and build all the mountains and lakes and geography, or should I use a randomly generated one and delete and edit geography as needed. Which would be fastest?

And help concerning images of cities and layouts would be appreciated.  The less time I have to spend researching these things, the more time I could spend actually building.

Like I said, I am going to start with kings landing, as it seems like a good central place in the world.

Now, good people of reddit, gemme your thoughts.",9,14,False,self,,,,,

It's my understanding that if the Kingsguard requires a lifelong oath, protecting the king for life, how on earth was Jaime allowed to be a commander in his father's civil under-war against the Starks? It seems like it would pose problems for the Kingsguard if their members went running off to battle every time their family's house became embroiled in a squabble.

Granted, Jaime had a not insignificant personal role in the instigation of the conflict after he attacked Ned, but it seems like the Lord Commander should have reprimanded him, reminded him of his sworn duty, and stuck him back in his spot. Or, if he just took off and fled to help Tywin before that was possible, wouldn't that pretty much be oathbreaking?",8,2,False,self,,,,,

Personally I think Arya getting kidnapped by the Hound would be a better place to end. That leaves a nice cliff hanger to be picked up in season 4.

[Here's the link](http://www.jeffrubinjeffrubin.com/post/17217755762/dothrakiinterview).

There are no Game of Thrones spoilers and, in fact, I think even someone who was completely unfamiliar with the franchise could enjoy it.

I appreciate some people are just never going to listen to a 60 minute podcast, so here's some fun tidbits to chew on...

* David got the gig by winning an intense competition. Several others submitted prototype Dothraki languages.
* There's no Dothraki word for book because the Dothraki don't have writing. They also don't have a word for throne, which is why Khal Drogo refers to it as 'the iron chair' in [this amazing scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6_WRDROdM) from episode 7 of the show.
* [Land of the Lost was the first TV show with a constructed language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Land_of_the_Lost_characters_and_species#Pakuni) (Klingon wasn't created until the Star Trek movies).
* The word 'Lost' is Dothraki for disappointment ([really, look it up in the dictionary](http://docs.dothraki.org/Dothraki.pdf)). There are a few other easter eggs.

If each book is a season (ignoring the idea that ASoS might be across 2 seasons) would AFFC be season 4 and ADWD season 5? Or would they mix parts of each book into each season, as their time lines overlap? 

To me it make sense to have parts of each book in season 4 and parts in season 5, so it all chronological, rather than as the books were written. Otherwise you will have a whole season with no Tyrion, no Dani and extreme little Jon.

Sansa is going to marry (whether forced or willfully) Little Finger, who in turn is going to continue to win at everything always.

I read the FAQ, but the answers to my questions were not in it. So if maybe someone could help me with this , I'd appreciate it.

(I just finished episode 3)


1) Please tell me that Tyrion doesnt turn into a huge asshole like the queen and her son. I like him too much for that to happen.


2) Why is Ned's 'bastard' so hated? Is the hatred just part of the time, and bastards were generally disregarded etc, or am I missing some major reason why Ned's wife would hate him that much?


3) Why is Viserys so stupid to actually believe he'll be the king one day? The savages dont respect him at all, and why would they ever make him their king?


4) Does Viserys' sister actually develop feelings for the savage king, or is this all some part of a plan?


Thanks a lot :)

He looks pale and skinny, too skinny.  He has some kind of green crust around the corners of his mouth and he has a haunted look in his eyes.

That got me thinking wouldn't it be cool if there was a super high resolution Westeros Map that people could print-off like a poster or a surface for that game. 

So here's the plan. 

This is the best Westeros map I've seen: 
http://gameofthrones.net/images/Westeros_Maps/map_of_westeros.jpg

The creator, Tear, seems to be pretty cool about other people using his work as long as it's not-for-profit purposes.

To print his awesome map at 40""x20"" 300DPI (movie poster size) it needs to be about 3X higher in resolution. I have some experience doing this kinda work. The results are good, but fairly slow. If anyone with Photoshop experience is willing to help, it would go by much quicker. I could break things down into a few tasks and we could be done in a few days. 

No matter what, when I'm all finished I have every intent of uploading a beefy PSD for people to have and share.

Ursa Major.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/pmdwq/lets_have_some_good_oldfashioned_speculation/,dahorn07,1329077326,"I just finished DWD last night. I've been thinking about it all day at work and I just wanna have some good conversation about it. Honestly the end of Jon's last chapter had me just as bummed as the red wedding. I don't think that's all for him though, I mean rhollor's priests have brought back the dead before. Of course everytime I've expected something GRRM goes ""well an extra 'fuck you' to you sir.""

I wanna talk about more, but my break is almost done. Until then, please let's discuss! I haven't had a good fanboy nerd out session for a while.

EDIT: Ok. Done with work. I never would have figured Jon to be Azor Ahai. Only reason being because I so closely associate him with the Old Gods. 

Honestly, I feel like Ramsey's letter is a taunt and that there's more lies than truth in it. GRRM just sort of left that story after Asha and Theon reunited. This book didn't exactly feel like his other books to me. Mainly in that this one left a lot of loose ends (duh.) But he when he usually leaves loose ends it's usually that he wrapped something else up. Each book had it's own sort of beginning and end. This one ended in a way that felt as  though DWD is going to bleed right into Winds of Winter. I just expected there to be more ""umph"" to how the Tyrion and Victarion story lines were going.

I'm totally rambling right now. This one might be one of my favorites so far. I love that he's not titling the chapters with just character names anymore, and that he's following so many characters in his later books. ""I'm gonna talk through Jamie now! But only once."" It adds so much to the chaos.

thats 200 for books 1-5, and i bought them all for 25 (33) from amazon! the downside? i have to read them in english, but ive been doing fine so far, im at the middle of the first one (page 389 atm) and so far only had to go check the diccionary about 10 times.

so heres the warning for those thinking about getting these books from their own country: you might wanna check out the english versions that are way cheaper if you can handle the english, it might look strange at first but after 5min im not even thinking in english anymore im just so into the story it feels like my mother tongue.

It's modified to look at what we're seeing in modern times with the government with their military and militarized police force, private corporations with their own security force and religious organizations with their matyrs and soldiers of god:

------------------
There are three men sitting down in a room. The first is the president of the country. The second is the pope of god almighty. The third is a billionaire with money, control of corporations and lands. A fourth man is stood there with a gun in his hand.

The president says, ""Kill the other two! As the law, I command you to carry out justice. Do so and the country will know your patriotism is pure.""

The pope says, ""Kill the other two! As a man of god, only by protecting me can you remain pure in the eyes of our lord god. Save your soul and obey me.""

The billionaire says, ""Kill the other two! As the world's wealthiest man, all of my money and property shall become yours. You will never work another day.""

The riddle is simply, ""Who survives?""

Or, burned idols forbid, you're too lazy to pick up one of the books and rely on HBO. 

Well, I thought we could have a nice little get-together where everyone suggests things akin to GoT/ASoIaF that we can read or watch as placebo until the second season starts in April. Keep 'em sharp and lively.

Mine, off the top of my head, are:

- Pillars of the Earth [Book] [TV] *politics + period*
- Rome [TV - HBO] *politics + characterization + epic + style*
- Wheel of Time series [Book] 
- [from /lit/, a guide to the fantasy genre](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100530215310/4chanlit/images/9/96/1270033573758.jpg) [Book]
- Berserk [Book - manga] [TV - anime] *cred to idiomikey, link at bottom of this post*
- and for fuck's sakes just read the damn ASoIaF books if you haven't

---

**Cautionary Tales** 

Pillars of the Earth has a more stock morality and less complex characters. I have a feeling someone will list Tudors and Borgias but I've seen both. I say they're OK, but not worth it.

I'll go out on a limb and also suggest *Carnivale* [HBO] and *The Wire*. These appeal more to the mentality of ASoIaF readers / GoT readers than to the actual content. Good if you're actually looking for a break from the genre but not from the quality.

Does anyone else like this one, or have any other favorites?


Ooooooh, I am the last of the giants,

my people are gone from the earth.

The last of the great mountain giants,

who ruled all the world at my birth.


Oh the smallfolk have stolen my forests,

theyve stolen my rivers and hills.

And theve built a great wall through my valleys,

and fished all the fish from my rills.


In stone halls they burn their great fires,

in stone halls they forge their sharp spears.

Whilst I walk alone in the mountains, 

with no true companion but tears.


They hunt me with dogs in the daylight, 

they hunt me with torches by night.

For these men who are small can never stand tall

whilst giants still walk in the light.


Ooooooh I am the LAST of the giants, 

so learn well the words of my song.

For when I am gone the singing will fade,

and the silence shall last long and long.


P.S. This is my first post on reddit, sorry if there's any etiquette I'm not observing.

I have read through the first book and am nearly finished with the second, and I have seen the first season of the show, as well as talked extensively with my friends who are both further along in the series and a tad behind myself.

   So, here it goes. [Speculation](/g ""I believe Jon Snow is Lyanna Starks child with Rhaegar Targaryen. "")

   I'd love to get some other opinions and just talk about it in general. This is my first online related talk on the subject.

My reasons are follows - Warning: These may be mild spoilers.

[Speculation](/g ""In the book/episode scene where Ned Stark and the king head for Kings landing, and Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister ect are heading for the wall, Jon asks Ned about his mother. Ned's response is that Jon may not have his name, but he does have his blood. I found this to be the first piece of evidence chronologically to support this theory.  "")

[Speculation](/g ""Next, on the kingsroad, Ned stark refused to discuss Jon Snow's mother to his supposed best friend, Robert Baratheon, who, hated Rhaegar so much he went to war to kill him. Robert Baratheon also hates all of the Targaryen's, and if he ever found Jon Snow to have Targaryen blood, he would most certainly have him killed, especially if he was the child of his worst enemy."")

[Speculation](/g ""Ned stark, though I cannot remember if it was in the book, or show or both, mentions making a promise to his sister as she was on her deathbed. and that when he remembers finding her, she smelled of blood and roses though she supposedly dies of fever, where blood would be unlikely. I believe she died in child birth and she made Ned promise not to reveal who the child's father was for fear of his life. Ned took the promise on his honor, even if it meant lying to his wife, his best friend and the rest of the world."")

[Speculation](/g ""Ned Stark is honor bound. Every single action he does in the series is guided by what is right and what is the honorable thing to do. He doesn't take the iron throne when he has the chance, he doesn't betray Stannis from the throne by accepting Renly's offer, and he fights Cersei for control when he knows he is doomed. To the point where why would he betray his honor to father a bastard while at war? it goes against everything else he does from the reader/veiwers point of veiw."")

WARNING! next speculation contains mild spoiler

[Speculation](/g ""When Jon snow grabs the lantern in the scene to burn the walker, he mentions in the book about how it initially didn't hurt him, but it did burn his skin and flesh. This would also make sense if he had half Targaryen blood in him, as full blooded Targaryen's can have the ablility to withstand fire and heat, as Daenerys demonstrated multiple times in the series thus far."")

[Speculation](/g ""When Daenerys meets with the undying in the second book, they mention that she is the queen of fire, and that together she will fulfill a prophecy of a song of fire and ice. There are mentions that the prophecy MUST be fulfilled, and that one of the three heads of the Targaryen dragon is Daenerys, and one of them is Rhaegar's son. and the third a mystery at this point. Rhaegar believed his son Aegon would fulfill the prophecy, but with him having been killed, It is likely that Jon Snow could have been the prophesied son. Also, as Daenerys being the queen of fire, and the song being a song of fire and ice, Jon's last name, the wall, or simply being in the northern part of Westeros, could be symbolic of the Ice mentioned."")

Thanks for reading and I would love feedback on ideas, either proving or disproving any of these, as well as just discussion on the subject.

My question is: **Are they going to cut off Tyrions nose in the HBO series? Is there any official confirmation one way or another?**

Those who have done all the reading will know about how important Tyrion becomes, and how often his knowledge of being made even uglier comes up. But, from the series point of view, do they really want one of the central characters to be walking around with some gruesome makeup for the next seven years? Will they tone it down to just a scar perhaps?

Obviously this has to have already been decided up to a point, if they stick to Tyrion going unconscious at the turn of the tide during the blackwater.

it... [spoilers]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/pzzxq/just_finished_a_clash_of_kings_and_i_need_to_talk/,Ruleroftheblind,1329864920,"So I've now listened to the first two audiobooks (So, keep in mind that I'll be spelling character/place names phonetically as I have not ever read their names).  First of all, Roy Dotrice does the narration for these books and he's absolutely amazing.  According to the GoT wikia, he was cast to play Maester Pycell but had to withdraw just before production due to health problems.  However, he will be playing Hallyne in the upcoming season.  

Anyway, **what follows is a breakdown of my feelings of the book based on characters.  At the end are a few questions I have that are making things very confusing, maybe you can help clear them up.**

Now, onto the book.  HOLY FUCKING SHIT.  I didn't know what to expect going into the book, but it sure as hell wasn't what I got.  

**Sansa.** I even enjoyed Sansa's bullshit.  Personally, I kind of really hate Sansa (except for one scene during the siege of King's Landing when Cersci leaves the banquet hall and Sansa FOR ONCE takes charge and calms everyone down) but she's an integral part of the book in that she's a set of eyes inside the court that doesn't belong to the Lannisters.  Having her perspective, naive as it may be, in contrast to Tyrion's is a very well used way to show us what's happening in King's Landing.

**Arya.**  Seriously, Arya is tied with Mara Jade (from the Star Wars novels) for my favorite fantasy female character of all time.  The fact that an 8 year old is as awesome as a fucking jedi spy/assassin/badass is really impressive.  I remember seeing posts on this subreddit that were simply a list of names and I didn't get it until this book.  I fucking love her list.  And more importantly, I fucking love Jayken Haggar.  The moment she met him chained to a wagon with Biter and the noseless guy whose name escapes me currently, I knew this dude was gonna be a badass and a big part of her story.  I love how Arya is always... like... becoming things.  Like, how she ""becomes"" the Ghost of Harrenhall, or when she uses Sirio Forell's advice and ""becomes"" quiet as a shadow and whatnot.  And I believe in her last chapter of the book, she decides that she will finally ""become"" The Wolf.  I seriously want her to grow up and destroy everyone she hates.  I don't want her to have a list anymore.  I want each name crossed off.  I will watch her do this and whistle the theme from Kill Bill as she does so.

**Danerys.**  I don't really like Danerys and it's hard for me to identify why.  She's a very cool character, but for me at least, she's very unrelatable, I guess.  I feel like she's got A LOT of character development to go through before I finally get on her side.  During GoT, I started to come over to her side during the whole ""stallion who mounts the world"" bit.  But without Khal Drogo, she's a lot less likeable.  I suppose though, if she shows up in Westeros with a small army and a few dragons, it'll be hard for me not to like her.  I really enjoy when someone just shows up out of nowhere and starts fucking shit up.

**Catelyn.**  Catelyn's a badass.  Her words are Family, Duty, Honor... but all I can think is Family, Badass, Badass.  I know some people might disagree because she doesn't actually DO a whole lot.  But compared to the other high-born ladies of the realm (excluding Cersei), she is a total fucking badass.  But since she doesn't do a whole lot in this book, there's not much more I can say about her at this time.

**Jon.**  I've been loving Jon's story.  I was so excited to find out we'd be going north of the Wall, especially after all the reports of Wildlings in the south.  Getting to follow him as he explores the North and begins the dream-type bonding with Ghost has been one of my favorite parts of the book.  Honestly, he reminds me the most of Eddard.  Jon, despite his ""unhappy"" ancestry (that is to say his bastardship), lives like Ned to be honorable.  He cannot bring himself to kill a yielding opponent even though he believes she would not show the same kindness to him.  He befriends the people who hate or resent him.  He believes in his oath to the Night's Watch just as much as he loves his family (and even though he's only partially part of the family, he still loves them as if he were a full-blooded member of the family).  Now that he's joined the wildlings, I can only see a bunch of badass-ery coming from him.  I think he's going to learn a lot more about the strangeness of the north while also building a strong relationship between the wildlings and himself, and therefore the Night's Watch and/or the Starks.  If I had to guess, I'd say that if Dany attacks Westeros, Jon will come down with an army of wildlings to defend the land.

**Davos.**  Davos played a very minor role and really only seemed to exist so that we could see into Stannis's camp.  Nevertheless, much like Catelyn, total badass.  He doesn't get much of a story arc, there's really not a lot of obstacles he has to personally overcome, but in everything he does, he comes out far more successful than most characters seem to.  As far as I can remember, we don't actually see him die during the battle in the river, but I can't really see how he might survive.  I just hope he does.

**Theon.**  Fucking Theon.  Stupid little bitch with his stupid little plans and his stupid little dick.  Fuck Theon.  I've been making my own Arya-type list and his name is very near the top.  I was so happy when the chick he was hitting on turned out to be his sister.  Best fucking scene ever.  Fuck Theon.  Fucking coward, iron-fucking, witless bastard.  Fuck Theon.  I swear, when we were given the impression that Theon had killed Bran and Rickon, I was driving in my car listening to the book and had approximately this reaction:  [He's lying](http://i.imgur.com/mLgBK.gif)... they're not dead... [FUCK YOU, GAYJOY!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ)

**Bran.**  You broken son of a bitch, all I want is for you to be the lord of Winterfell.  I love Bran like a brother.  I honestly feel like he's my little brother and I want to help him be the best man he can be.  Not that he needs my help... I mean the boy's the son of Boromir, he is psychically connected to a goddamn dire wolf, instead of legs he has a half-giant, and his best friends are frog-spearing, green-seeing creepy kids and a goddamn wildling.  Bran has everything he needs to become a major force in the land of Westeros.  Now, about Rickon.  That little fucker scares me.  The boy is as wild as his wolf.  I recall someone posting a map of each character's journey a month or so ago and one of the comments on the post was something along the lines of ""If only it could show us where the hell Rickon is"".  At the end of CoK, Rickon is heading off with Usher while Bran, Hodor, and the creepy kids go off in a different direction.  I believe Rickon is going to somehow end up growing up in a widling fashion (I mean, he's pretty fucking wild as it is and now he's going to be raised by a widling woman).  He's either going to end up dead, or he's going to come across Jon Snow at some point and either one of them is going to kill the other, or they're gonna team the fuck up and bring some wildling pain down on Westeros.

**Tyrion.**  Ah, Tyrion.  The most awesome character of all.  In GoT, he starts out pretty cool.  By then end, he's awesome.  In CoK, he starts of awesome.  By the end, he's FUCKING AWESOME.  Seriously, when he shows up in King's Landing as the Hand... I mean, he wastes NO time before getting all up in everyone's business and just fucking with it.  It didn't take him half the time it took ANYONE else before he was blackmailing members of the court, slapping Joffrey, and just busting out justice like a midget version of the Terminator.  And then, when King's Landing is attacked, we see the fruition of his meddlings.  The holks filled with wildfire.  The chain.  Brilliant little fucker!  And if that's not enough... he basically flips off The Hound, hops on a horse, and leads a charge against the enemy.  Not like he's sitting in the back yelling for his men to go and fight.  No, he's at the head of a cavalry wedge.  FUCK!  And before he charges out he rallies the troops by basically saying, ""I'm a half a man and I'm brave enough to do this... if you don't come with me, what does that make you?""  I want the future to give me Tyrion in charge of the South, Bran in charge of the Winterfell lands, and Jon in charge of the North.  Un-fucking-stoppable.

Now, a few questions.  Maybe I heard it wrong... but did Renly suddenly stop being dead?  I keep getting the Baratheon brothers confused.  As far as I'm aware, Stannis is the brutish Robert-like brother with the red bitch and the fire/light god who ends up attacking King's Landing.  Renly is the ""fair"" brother who gets his throat slit by a shadow.  But after the siege of King's Landing, the once-knight now-fool guy that meets with Sansa says something about Renly showing up to fight off Stannis, along with Tywin.  Did I miss something?  Is Renly dead or not?

What's going on in Harrenhall?  Tywin was there, but he left to go to King's Landing and so the bloody mummers folks were in charge for a bit, I think.  Then arya frees the northmen but the place gets taken over by the Frays I think?  Or the Bolton bastard?  The Flayed Man belongs to the Boltons, right?  But aren't they part of the north?  One of the Starks' bannermen?

My take on the moral of the books so far:  No one gets what they want, no matter what, stop trying, you're going to die.

Edit:  About Arya.  She'd better get reunited with Nymeria.  I'll find GRRM's house, knock on his door, and when he answers I'll be all like, ""Hey!  You're a jerk!"" and then maybe kick a lawn ornament or something, just so he knows I'm not fucking around.",87,38,False,self,,,,,

There seems to be a bit of debate about the release of the last two books: It's common nature to assume that since HBO has taken on the series, the books will have to be served up promptly in order to let the show's seasons progress without hiatus and presumably honor whatever contractual agreement HBO has with George R. R. Martin.

However:

- HBO's signed on to do seasons three and four, but they're pretty notorious for cutting series off if they're too expensive;
- The fictional universe keeps expanding, increasing the cost and complication of production; and
- It seems to me (again, I've only read a book and a half so far) that the conflict that develops later in the series grows to become more cosmic in nature rather than the mano-a-mano politics and brute force  that the earlier books engage, and that HBO has relied on for many of its past successes. How much would they really be interested in taking this to the end in that case? (Though, I guess, True Blood got pretty wacky...)



So I'd like to know:


Do you think that GRRM will at all bend the way he's writing the end of the series with the show in mind? 

If the show catches up to the books, would HBO stake a hiatus, simply cancel the show? What would that depend on? 

And, if HBO decides to cut things short at any point (we're talking end of ASoS so far), do you think they'd alter the content for a conclusion, or just truncate? How?",24,11,False,self,,,,,

(spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/q3og9/just_finished_acok_for_the_first_time_thoughts_if/,[deleted],1330060557,"So, first let me just thank my neighbor for getting me into the show and then a lovely man convincing me/guiding me through getting into the books. I feel like I've invested a lot of myself into these characters!

I started the series in December... juggling school and work, it's hard to really invest as much time as I'd like to in the series but I figure there's no real rush considering the wait for the 6th book may be a bit of a long time. I watched the show and was instantly interested and got a set of the series shortly after finishing all of the episodes. The first book I feel took forever, probably since nothing really NEW was happening, but I was still very impressed by the entire existence of this realm. This is also the first Fantasy series I've read since Harry Potter... harhar.

So.. ACoK. I'll run through my thoughts on the characters. Tyrion was my favorite from the first time seeing the show even. Even when he's kind of a dick, he's totally awesome and I can't picture a point where I'd dislike him. I just feel like he's a really straightforward guy, no time for fucking around except I guess he's a little hedonistic sometimes. I relate to that... he just reminds me of a lot of people I know. I know if I were ever in a sticky situation, he'd be the one I trust most (well maybe Jon would tie for that position too).

The other Lannisters... Cersei's batshit insane, I feel at this point. Just the way she talks to Sansa sometimes, about being a woman and a mother and a queen. She totally freaks me out and reminds me of my own mother. Terrifying. I don't hate her but I don't like her at all. I'm just hoping she makes some good decisions sometime soon... I feel like she's honestly terrified of the current situation and she better get some good sense in her quick. As for Jamie, a friend told me he possibly redeems himself, so I'll have faith in that and won't get too invested in hating him just yet. He just better get his act together too. 

The Hound and Sansa. I have a soft spot for The Hound and not so much for Sansa just yet. I'm hoping that all this shit will teach her to man up. She has a lot of potential, could be a really smart girl and can really become a very important character if she acts right. The Hound is just, in all his jerkiness, a totally real dude and a badass. I want him to kick some ass and put some people in their place.

I want to see more of Davos. I feel like I haven't really gotten much of a feel for his character yet and I sincerely hope that changes. I don't know exactly what to expect for him at all yet. Stannis. I think Stannis is a good guy at heart but really messed up with that magic shit and just so much ANGST. C'mon dude just chill out. I wouldn't put him on the Iron Throne though. One thing that really turned me off from him is his whole grudge against Ned Stark from early on in ACoK. Honestly, if I were Stannis and Robb Stark I'd seriously try to work something out because the Baratheons and the Starks are some hearty people and I think they'd work well as a team. Robb's a nice boy... that's all I have to say about him so far! I hope he doesn't get messed up in any crud and lose his head though...

Theon and Asha and everything about the Iron Islands freaks me out. I think I had nightmares about Theon and Balon Greyjoy taking over everything. They just give me chills, more so than the Others, Wildlings, Dragons, anything. Theon disgusts me right now, but I think he is a very very lost boy, not really fitting the mold of the Greyjoys but not wanting to be like the Starks. I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

ARYA ARYA ARYA! Maybe I lied before, I think I liked Arya before I liked Tyrion. But anways, love Arya! Part of me wants all the Starks to reunite and be an awesome superpower team and crush everyone, but I feel like there's gotta be really great things for Arya to accomplish on her own. She's just so special and just doesn't give a F. I hope her and Jon reunite though because they're just the loveliest people. Respect.

Other Starks! There's Rickon.. that's that. Bran, love bran, how could you not? I really wish great things for him. When I thought he was dead, I knew it was impossible. Ain't happenin'! I feel like I don't have much to say about the characters because I am just waiting to see what happens next. I haven't really liked Catelyn at all during the series actually. Don't know what it is that irks me. There's just always something I don't like about extremely motherly characters.

Jon Snow. Everything that's happening beyond the wall is so terrifying and amazing. Seriously the most vivid moments of my reading experience during these books. I just read the prologue of ASoS and now I'm just itching to find out just about the wall/wildlings and all that greatness. Jon Snow is seriously wonderful and I can sense great things coming up for him... And the ending of the book, man! I just have no words, only tears in my eyes.

And... who else. Oh, Daenerys. I'm not really liking her right now. I liked her in the TV series until I read the books. The vibes I'm getting from her right now is just ""Give me this because I'm entitled to it"" since she's mother of the dragons and all... I mean I hope she evolves into something greater, she still is so young I feel, and has a lot to learn. 

Varys and Littlefinger. Varys is so challenging to deal with. Gosh, I want so badly to think good things of him but he talks about serving the realm and the realm and the realm and I just don't see it, but maybe that's just me being biased. I don't really see what he's done for the greatness of the realm just yet, maybe I'm missing something, maybe something's yet to come. In the TV series I liked Littlefinger for some sick, twisted reason. I'll decide what I think of him when I find out more about what he's up to.

Renly's death... man that was depressing. I was so charmed by him, I feel as anyone would be, what a pleasant character, and then he's dead! But then I think about if he wasn't, what an unnecessary amount of kings.

Other things. I'm really interested to see where this whole wolf-dream thing takes us. Also, WINTERFELL?!!??!@!@*(^# The fuh. Who even were those people....

At this point, who do I want to have the Iron Throne, no matter what? I can't even choose one. Part of me thinks Tyrion would be the best king, he's just got the greatest mind. I don't know if there even should be an Iron Throne anymore... Let there be a king of the north, the south, yada yada. But I also don't even know anything yet so who am I to decide!? Anyway. I've enjoyed this series so much so far and thank goodness for this subreddit.

The hen, in a snobby voice, says 'will you guys shut up' to which I reply 'THIS IS NOT YOUR COURTYARD!! YOU ARE NOT THE LORD OF WINTERFELL!!' and a few of the women squeal and run over as they are big fans of the show.

One of them, a particually hot brunette, decides to stay and chat with me whilst her mates go inside, and we have flirty game of thrones times... She kept on demanding I told her what happened in ASOS as she was reading ACOK but I was pretty smooth, just said 'arya becomes a badass, sansa ends up at the eyrie' to which she replied 'with her aunt?' 'yes. with her aunt'. She kept begging for more (eh lads ? eh ?) but I refused...

It was rad, spoke to her few times through the night getting some good vibes and when it came to leave i gave her a hug and shit and she was like 'i've got a husband. but add me on facebook and you can be my GOT buddy'.... then once more she goes 'pleeease tell me what happens' and I just say 'Tyrion kills Tywin'. There is look of elation in her eyes; I turn my back and leave.

**TLDR got flirty with hot older woman due to me being a huge nerd.**

Now, this made me a very, very happy man - not the whole OH GOD SHE TALKED TO ME thing, cause i'm not THAT bad .... But, like, I shouted a total nerd reference for the enjoyment of my fellow stoner teens and ended up chatting up a fine older woman, when normally I am AWFUL and initating conversation. Ther main thing that I was enthuastic about is im a 21 year old, short kinda grungy looking music nerd, and she was at least 28 and typically 'fit'.

My point is that his makes me happy as it really shows how things that ten years ago would have been considered nerdy and uncool by ladies such as themselves (they were typical hoop earring'd, dyed hair, WKD type of british women) whilst now the general public are starting to accept that fiction (and other shit!) involving swords and horses CAN be really cool and awesome, and how it's not just for bedroom lockaways. 

Who knows, maybe in ten years time i'l be able to openly talk about my own personal modificiation of the 3.5 ruleset with full weapon randomisation tables ala borderlands.

**TLDR Nerdy things are not longer just being seen as something for spoddy teens, and it's rad.**",4,13,False,self,,,,,

So GOT S1 came out April 2011, and ADWD book came out July 2011. If his 4-6 year waits persist between ADWD, TWOW, and ADOS, the tv show will have to have a hiatus, even with ASOS broken up into 2 seasons and not done in a spring/fall release (2 seasons same year), but 2 seasons 2 years, EVEN if he gets the next two done with just 4 years apart, that STILL puts the TV show production to a halt for a few years, meaning fairly young characters will be in their mid to late 20s by the time the last book is filmed...

* GOT S1 4/2011 | ADWD 7/2011
* GOT S2 (ACOK) 4/2012 | ~
* GOT S3.1 (ASOS) 4/2013 | ~
* GOT S3.2 (ASOS) 4/2014| ~
* GOT S4 (AFFC) 4/2015| TWOW ? 2015
* GOT S5 (ADWD) 4/2016 | ~
* GOT S6 (TWOW) 4/2017 | ~
* HIATUS 2018
* HIATUS 2019 | ADOS ? 2019
* GOT S7 (ADOS)- 2020.

Holy fuck, that might be the most depressing thing I've ever typed out. While this is speculation, it makes sense. anyone have anything that might deflate this depressing thought/theory of mine? One that came to mind would be them making AFFC, ADWD, and TWOW all 2 seasons each like ASOS, but again, that was only based on the 4 year wait...and the last two books have been 5 &amp; 6 years, I'm only being generous here. And the likelihood that the show goes from 8 seasons to 11+ is extremely low, because thats a huge cost increase. Sigh.
