Everything she does is purely out of faith and the desire to aid in saving humanity. People don't like her for some of the things she did... and they were really bad things. **BUT** me being a huge history buff.. lemme just turn to history.

George Washington - owned slaves

Multiple Conquistadors/explorers and colonizers of the new world - murdered immense amounts of natives

Francis Drake (one of my favorite historical figures btw) - was, after all, a pirate so basically a murderer thief rapist three in one package

Vlad Dracula - became infamous for impaling people, earning the nickname ""Vlad the impaler."" And eventually being the inspiration for dracula.

Da Vinci, Michaelangelo, and many other famous painters and sculptors - experimented with human bodies (also possibly living ones) to learn more about the body

Jack Sparrow - Said ""ra'e"" instead of ""rape"" since ""Black Pearl"" was a ""family movie."" (THE WORST!)

All of these people and many more made profound contributions to society and are widely respected today (some more than others... some aren't given the respect they deserve... sadly) but they all had their ""crazies."" After all, we're all people... And good ol'e Mel is justified more than these others because she did everything out of a selfless devotion to her cause. Not selfish desires.",105,27,False,self,,,,,

Check that out. Joffery demands Tyrion fill the cup, the camera IMMEDIATELY pans over to Tywin, who until now, has been as stonefaced and expressionless as can be.

This is Game of Thrones. The acting and subtle facial expressions are superb. Part of what makes it interesting is seeing how one character may have a terrible pokerface while another is hard for even the audience to read. If you watch the full scene, you can also see the various facial expressions of everyone present. Margery does a decent job of masking her discomfort, Sansa has her usual blank expression she's learned to wear at all times, Cersei cannot help but smirk and enjoy the moment, Tommen is noticeably uncomfortable when Joffery and Tyrion start with their back-and-forth, and the whole time, Tywin is absolutely stone-faced with a typical expression of his that means disapproval to the audience, but masks his feelings well enough from the other players in the Game of Thrones. The one scene here is the only exception to the rule.

I believe a good writer/director/produce/what-have-you includes everything with purpose. That's a basic theory behind understanding what exactly a writer is trying to tell you. I don't see the order of these scenes as being coincidence. Tywin reacts immediately after a command is given that will ultimately doom Joffery. There's two possibilities: Tywin doesn't know about the assassination attempt and this scene of Tywin changing his expression is there purely by coincidence and a rather nonsensical little snippet to include, or Tywin does know and this specific little cut to his expression is supposed to convey it. The latter sounds more likely to me.

It's also worth noting that if you keep an eye on Tywin throughout the rest of the scene, he again seems out of place. When Margery calls attention to the pie, Tywin is the last to react, as if he was concentrating on the situation at hand, so deep in thought that it made him take longer to process what was going on. It's also worth noting that as Tyrion picks up the wine glass off the table as the pie is served, the camera angle takes special care to include Olenna and the wine cup in the same shot; this serves as evidence that yes, such tiny subtleties can hold a lot of meaning. Also worth mentioning, I feel, is that we've seen Tywin come close to an assassin before. In season 3 (2?) when evidence of an assassin was close to Tywin, he IMMEDIATELY called for the guards. Loudly, urgently. Here? He never actually does it, and we know he expends little effort thereafter into actually finding the killers. Perhaps because he knew who the killer was and that charging the killer would put his house in jeoprody, thus he silently allows everything to unfold. In the wedding itself, he can be seen going to who...? Tommen. The moment Joffery is dying, Tywin isn't calling for guards, he isn't examining Joffery, he's ensuring that the next heir-to-be isn't in danger.

This next little scene is less damning and I think it is something someone could consider coincidence, but here: https://youtu.be/7uu9XfhekGo?t=3m29s

Olenna just got done talking to Sansa, and as we later discover, that very scene is pivotal for the assassination. The scene as Olenna walks away shows Tywin in the bottom left corner looking directly towards their table. Again, this isn't the most convincing ""evidence,"" I'm only mentioning it too for the sake of being thorough.

If Tywin were to know about the assassinations, it had quite a few implications. For one, it says he's willing to off Joffery. That's not the biggest surprise really. Yes he cares about the Lannisters, but I'm sure he also considers Joffery to shame the family name. Let's say Tywin knew who was behind the assassination; this would again suggest he considers the Lannister-Tyrell alliance more important than Joffery, which again isn't too hard to believe.

...But what about Tyrion? Unfortunately, this raises as many questions as it answers, because all we have to go off of is one facial expression. I personally feel like the expression show displays a sense of reluctance or disapproval, though it's by no means obvious, so someone could just as easily argue the expression shows a sense of satisfaction with what's about to unfold, or perhaps that the expression itself is occuring solely in response to Joffery's impending doom, completely independent of the risks to Tyrion that will transpire.

Personally? Personally I see this as proof he somehow knew what was going to happen, and that perhaps he accepted Tyrion as the scapegoat only reluctantly. I've long questioned why Tywin did what he did, as it seems rather stupid, foolish and hateful to just accept Tyrion as a scapegoat for no reason. Yes Tywin isn't overly fond of Tyrion, but I also take him for his word: he respected Tyrion and considered his contributions to the Lannister family valuable. I do not believe Tywin would ever orchestrate a plot to be rid of Tyrion on his own; hell, he had that chance when Tyrion was born.

But if he knows what's going on...? Suddenly it makes a bit more sense. Tywin is actually protecting Olenna, because he knows the alternative would see the Lannisters and the Tyrells going to war, which he simply cannot allow. Likewise, the target was Joffery, who Tywin doesn't seem at all fond of. If anything, that deal is somewhat of a win for Tywin, as he gets to replace a shameful Lannister heir with a more easily influenced one that can do the name proud. Tyrion, unfortunately, gets caught up in the middle as a scapegoat, and I believe Tywin begrudgingly accepts this with the full intent of sending Tyrion to the wall. It's something he does reluctantly because although Tyrion is by no means his favorite and a scapegoat is neccesary for the safety of their family, he's still losing a valuable advisor. And Tywin being Tywin, he remains pragmatic and tries to exploit the situation to his favor, namely to try and get Jaime to abandon the King's Guard.

Thoughts?

Wild speculation on my part? Certainly plausible? Let's hear it.

We generally agree that blood magic is the most powerful magic in this fictional world, right?

Picture this: Part of the pact between the Others and men was to keep a Stark at Winterfell. This they monitored through the weirwood network. The last ""invasion"" by the Others was resolved with a marriage which introduced ice blood to the Stark bloodline. By always keeping a Stark at Winterfell, the Others were keeping Other blood there as well. What implications this could have beyond satisfying the peace treaty I don't know. But I wager the Others do not approve of mixing their blood with fire blood. This and the northern encroachment seem like logical motivations for their current ""invasion.""

I thought the issue of his parentage not being accurate (Honorable Ned Stark + a tavern wench) was obviously not true, based on the repeated claim, over and over, that he was a bastard. Writers like GRRM don't make that point obvious, unless there's something to it, that surprises down the line. But....R + L = J doesn't actually change that status. Jon (assuming he's resurrected with the help of his trusty direwolf Ghost and Melisandre, with an assist by Ser Davos), is still a bastard, an illegitimate child between Rhaegar Targeryan and Lyanna Stark. So it would seem, that in order for that plot hole to be fixed, that there should be some proof that they married, quietly and secretly. (Somewhat similar to Rob Stark, or even like William Wallace in the movie Braveheart) If so, who could have witnessed or performed the ceremony? Did it have to be someone connected with the 7 gods, or even a Maester?

I noticed something that to me seemed important in the TV episode Hardhome, and possible future episodes,  but I did not see discussed, or analyzed anywhere else.   Its more that the Night's King and the other White Walkers, appeared to use actual military strategy in their battle.   To wit:


 The timing of the attack.    They waited until after Jon Snow  had convinced some of the Free Folk wildlings to come with them on their boats.    If someone with the White Walkers was keeping eyes on Hardhome, they would recognize the ships. and perhaps they would wait to see if anyone was doing anything. after all, these are basically conscripts that are living at Hardhome, that they plan to ""involuntarily draft"" into the Wight army.

But when the wildlings began leaving, they would have no choice but to attack otherwise, it was possible, that all their new involuntary recruits would go with Jon Snow out of reach.   This takes a little bit of time to organize, but makes practical sense, as to why they attacked then. It was time sensitive.


2.  The location of the attack.   They didnt start right at the shore.   Remember that snow kicking up miles away with  the dogs barking to add to the level of tension?   Thats weird, right?   Except, I think they pulled the same thing later, with the undead jumping off the cliff (without snow).   The snow may be an indication of something weird, but not a definite indication that Hardhome and the wildinga were being attacked.    So they start the attack, by surprise far away, and with the wights basically rolling down the mountain, kicking up a bunch of snow, which is what we saw. thinking that not only would they be able to kill a lot of the people outside the gates, but able to get within the gates before anyone could stop them, and thereby having 100% success in getting new involuntary recruits.   It was a good plan, except for the F'ing Thann being suspicious enough to close the gates at the first sign of problems. that gave the rest a fighting chance.
Only when it was no longer a surprise, did the rest of the undead, jump over the cliff..


All and all, seems that the Night King, was deliberate, perhaps not to the level of Sun Tzu, but with a plan of action that was not in keeping with mindless zombies, but a real goal orientated design, and adjusting on the field of battle.   I didn't see any of the many commentators on Game of Thrones, seem to appreciate this.  (though the episode itself was well lauded, so it's easy to overlook I suppose).",6,0,False,self,,,,,

(Gendry, half-Baratheon has been busy rowing for 2 years straight, so is unlikely to play a major role this season)

This brings up the question, that we have to face, and probably already discussed by the showrunners...who shall replace the Baratheon Stag?    Presumably, the 4th strongest house remaining, after Targaryen/Dragon, Stark/Direwolf, and Lannister/Lion.

I would say the main possibilities ( which could change as the season progresses) are;

1. Greyjoy (Squid)--ignored last 2 seasons except Theon, but they're prominent this year, and only remaining king left from war of 5 kings.

2. Baelish/Littlefinger (Mockingbird) .   He's still working hard  between the scenes, but he's becoming more powerful, and always a threat, even if most don't recognize it.

3.  Tyrell (Rose).   The Tyrells should be active as Queen Margery, and her brother and Lady Tyrell are quite cunning.    A Rose doesn't have the impact as a sigil as a direwolf, but part of the basis for GoT historically was the war of the Roses in England....so could be part of GRRM's grand design, with a nod to history.

4.  Last but least, (except they are), are the Boltons /(Flayed Man) sigil.   I don't like to think about it, but they have become a powerful force in Westeros.   Could be that their defeat of Stannis, means that they claim the Baratheon opening.


My opinion, though it may take a few episodes, would oddly enough be the Greyjoys.",11,3,False,self,,,,,

At the end, Davos can't remember who the owner of the sword ""Lightbringer"" is, to which the host hints ""remember who you are working for"". Lightbringer in the books is the sword of Azor Ahai, who is meant to be reborn and destroy the white walker army. Many people believe that Jon Snow is going to be resurrected as Azor Ahai, and since we've already seen Davos guarding Jon's body in the trailers I think it's very likely that the beliefs are true.
I do think that we can be certain of Jon's return by now, but I found it interesting that they probably hinted it even in a video like this.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

When Jon is being resurrected, Davos says ""I'm sorry for what you are about to see..."" And cuts the head off of Ghost. ""Look, nights watch I'm on your side! Murder that red witch!""

Melisandre dies on the cold, icy ground.

The wildlings attack the Boltons but get curb stomped by 20 good men. Ramsay then recaptures Reek and Sansa. Btw, Reek was in on it the whole time. He decides they are both boring and chooses to transform Sansa into Reek and Reek into Sansa via torture. Roose proclaims Ramsay a true Bolton and gets his throat slit the very next night. 

Cersei demands a trial by combat and chooses the Undead Mountain. The clergy chooses a gravedigger. Surprise he's the Hound! Both are about to fight, but the Hound proclaims he is now a pacifist in the name of the Seven. He dies in two seconds.

Arya continues to stay blind. No story progression whatsoever.

The Spider and the Imp get attacked by more masked men. Grey worm and one of them dies in the attack.

Khaleesi is now a trapped prisoner, who cannot be freed because of the ""crimes"" she committed earlier to the DothRaki and cannot be killed because her big ass dragon would wipe out the remaining DothRaki.

Olly becomes steward of Thorne, the new commander of the Night's Watch. Davos is free to go anywhere he chooses. He returns to the death site of Shireen and commits sepuku.

The season ends with the Night's Watch all laughing and drinking beer. Then a horn sounds. Thorne, still drunk, looks over the wall. The White Walker Army is here at last. Olly is given the role of messenger, so he leaves for King's Landing while everyone else on the wall dies.

If we count it out, if the show takes no breaks and runs for 10 straight weeks, the show will have its season finale on June 26th, the latest finale we've had so far.  However, this has the potential to be even later than that because of memorial day (a USA national Holiday).  Last year the show didn't take a break for memorial day and the show has its lowest ratings on that day in a long time.  So I wouldn't be surprised if there is no new episode on the Sunday before memorial day this year because of the predictably low ratings that will happen on that day.  Soooo that means the show would wrap up on July 3 instead, if not for USA independence day on July 4.  This leads to the same situation as memorial day.  The ratings on that Sunday would be low so it wouldn't be a good idea to air an episode that day.  So the new finale date would be July 10.

surprised that no-one has picked up on the fact that during the battle of
the bastards shots the Umber sigil is seen along the Bolton's on multiple shots.

This has made me quite fearful for Rickon Stark this season as he is supposedly hiding 
out with the Umbers at last Hearth since season 3.

The only theory that makes sense to me so far is this, since Jon let the wildlings 
through the wall and onto the gift, which borders the Umber lands, the Umbers are extremely pissed, 
seeing as they hate the wildlings as much, if not more that the nights watch, and as such, they make
a deal with the Bolton's to wipe the wildlings out, the Bolton's do this is in exchange for Rickon crispy
on a cross.

Please don't let this be so...

As someone who was introduced to the series by reading all the books after watching a few episodes of Season 1. For years I've known about 90% of what's going to happen far in advance. 

I remember reading the episode titles with so much foreknowledge. There isn't a single book reader who didn't know what 'The Rains of Castamere' or 'The Viper and the Mountain' was going to be about. But now we're embarking into unknown territory. We know parts of past books are going to resurface, such as the Iron Islands and potentially Lord Manderly, but we don't know where they fit into the overarching story as it charges ahead. We have absolutely zero clue what's going to happen to Daenerys or to Meereen under the care of Tyrion. And we really just don't know what else might pop up that we haven't heard about yet. 

Each episode is a mystery. Even if those elements from the books do resurface we have no idea what direction they'll actually go in. Theon and ~~Jeyne~~ Sansa, for example, are running around without Stannis to capture them. When we watch the show with non-book reading friends, we can't sit there and act smug as major characters are killed or maimed, we'll be just as shocked as they are. Which will actually make it kind of more fun. ",14,41,False,self,,,,,

What if Tywin planted her there?  Foreigner with an unknown/untraceable name that is just smoking hot? That's hard to resist. Tywin knows Robb is just a boy.

Not much, if she went unnoticed by Robb then Tywin had someone to help injured Lannister men.

After she dispatches them to a town called pain, we have a slow pan to the ground. Stannis isn't dead after all. Brienne's initial swipe was to an approaching enemy. The action that followed gave her pause for thought and just then, she hears screams and panic...it's Sansa and Theon running for their lives. Her duty. It's right there.

Ramsay is on the approach on horseback with Hounds in toe. Sansa is frantic, Theon splits it and Brienne stands her ground. In battle with Ramsay, Brienne is about to be beaten back, but in-steps Pod at the last minute to save her, when he is suddenly horrifically wounded (but still living). Both Pod and Ramsay are out for a short time.

After a short discussion about where the safest place to go is, Brienne convinces Sansa to go with her. Pod is laying helpless, but Brienne knows nothing can be done. Her duty is to Sansa. She leaves Stannis and Pod for dead, but still both very much alive.

It is my belief that Stannis and Pod will be the ones gettin' crispy once Ramsay ~~awakens~~ gets his shit together. He burns them as a warning to those who may wish to side with Sansa and rebel with the North against the Boltons.

Jaqen talks to Arya about being a faceless man and asks her to come to Braavos with him, but Arya refuses. 

What I found weird was Jaqen says to Arya that if she were to become a faceless man, she could offer names on her list to the red god, Tywin, Cersei etc.
I thought that the point of becoming a faceless man is to become 'No-one' and forget everything and everyone related to your past identity.

In S5, E10, Arya is even punished for killing Meryn Trant.

So why does Jaqen say this to Arya in S2?#

White Rat lays down with a woman who hums him a song and caresses him, only for a Son of the Harpy to slit his throat while she looks on calmly. Later in season 5, something similar happens with a prostitute when the Sons of the Harpy revolt. Why?

The simplest answer is money, but I don't think that works. These women cooly, almost hatefully, watch as the men are slaughtered. Sure, the Sons of the Harpy probably paid them. But damn, I would definitely run screaming if the guy I had just been caressing was murdered basically on top of me, even if I knew it was coming.

These women were probably slaves, and they still have their jobs, so why are they so against Daenerys and the other freed slaves? Why do they seem to hate everyone but the masters? If I was on Daenerys's side, no amount of money would make me be an accomplice in an Unsullied's murder, and I especially wouldn't just stand there next to the murderer.

Like I said, the easiest answer is ""They were paid"" but I really just don't think that makes sense.

In [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv_S5iabJcI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2520) where Jaime is leaving for KL and Brienne is being left with Locke, Brienne says goodbye to Jaime and Jaime says nothing as he leaves.

And in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv_S5iabJcI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3361) when Brienne is leaving on her quest to find the Stark girls, Jaime says goodbye and Brienne doesn't say anything in much the same way.

I don't know if this is supposed to be some subtle thing between them like that is their way of saying they will meet again, or maybe their way of communicating their feelings for each other, since it is obvious there are strong emotions between them.  Don't even know if it this way in the books or not but I liked the way it plays out where the person who is staying behind says goodbye and the person who is leaving appears too emotional to be able to say it back like they don't want to leave the other.

George RR Martin tries to avoid the clich fantasy tropes in his writing, and it seems too clich that the good guy is betrayed by his brothers, and is revived discovering his true identity and to be the overall hero. It also seems way too obvious for a show like Game of Thrones. Also, I don't think Jon is the key character in the show or books, but I think the key character, the person who will lead humanity against the White Walkers, is Jorah Mormont.
You may have seen this in a Film Theories video ( http://youtu.be/tBvOQPD_cD8 ), and this is where I get much of this from, but in that video they miss out one major point. They say that Jorah may kill Dany to forge Lightbringer with the blood of the dragon, but he already has the blood of the dragon, technically. When Dany walks onto Drogo's funeral pyre and the dragons hatch, when Jorah finds her in the morning, he says ""Blood of my blood"", which, albeit not literally, means he now has the blood of the dragon.  Not to mention that Longclaw is (kind of) Jorah's sword. This does seem like something GRRM would do, and it is not literal or anywhere near as obvious as Jon or Dany being Azor Ahai.

A flaw in this however would be that Jorah does not say such a thing in the books, but still, a man can dream.

This has probably been suggested already but I just thought that I'd post it in case it wasn't.

EDIT: even if Jon does come back, the second half of my post still stands, that it would be too obvious for him to be Azor Ahai, and the same with Dany, since GRRM tries to go for unpredictability, and Jon or Dany being AA is far too obvious.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

But my options are:

* begin where I left off, and have only a vague memory of the plot so far and probably lose interest because I don't know what's going on

* begin at S01E01 and sink 30-odd hours into watching the first two series again, and probably being bored for a lot of it because I know bits of what happens, and risking losing interest because I know too much of what's going on

So I'd like it if someone could point me toward a resource which gives an overview/tl;dr of what happens in series 1&amp;2 without spoiling anything which happens in series 3+, so I can resume the series and enjoy it properly. Just the major/relevant plot points for the series. I don't know exact;y which episodes I watched, but I saw up to the [section of plot](#s ""Red Wedding"")

---

To avoid spoilers, as I've somehow managed to do for the past few years, my strategy for this thread will be to not look at it until a few days time. If I'm continually checking it, I risk some troll spoiling the rest of the plot, whereas if I check back at a random time over the next week or so, I'd hope any troll spoilers have been reported/removed/at least downvoted by that time.

It seems like he is getting as much press time as he can, while he can. 

He has been a strong supporting character since Season 1. He is not new to this. He may have been promoted a little bit this season, but he isn't a main character(Starks/Dany/Lannisters). He is not even Littlefinger/Briene/Varys/Tyrell level. He doesn't have his own story line, he just tags-along. 

Based on this recent influx of interviews, I have a feeling that he dies in one of the first 2 episodes.

So, in the trailer, we see what looks like the Kingsmoot, Euron dramatically lifting his hood on a bridge, some possibly Greyjoy ships in the middle of a sea during a storm and Yara/Asha making out with a woman who looks like she is from Essos. To piece these things together we have a lot of information provided to us via Mr. Martin. Euron returns to the Iron Islands and is elected King (after the death of Balon) on the promise he will conquer Westeros. This is what will most likely happen at the Kingsmoot. He then sends his brother, Victarion, to Essos w/ the Iron Fleet to find Dany so Euron can marry her and capture her dragons (using Dragonbinder, a horn). ""When the kraken weds the dragon, brother, let all the world beware"" Euron is quoted saying. Victarion will not be in the show so I am going to assume Euron takes this role since the show does this with a catalogue of the characters we see.

Okay, so, Dragonbinder. This is a horn that Euron found and when blown it will bring dragons to the horn's owner. However, whoever blows the horn is killed which means Euron would probably just get one of his companions to blow the horn. This would obviously be a huge part of the story but could end up in the wrong hands, be destroyed by Dany or someone close to her etc. and almost end the Euron's promise of ruling Westeros. Whatever makes the viewers go :O.

Now, it seems very likely that the woman Yara/Asha is kissing is a whore from Essos and the ships riding in the sea are the Iron Fleet. Furthermore, we know Euron isn't a character to be taken lightly by the way he is described and by his actions. Yara/Asha says he is ""mad"" and ""dangerous"" in ADWD, Baelor Blacktyde states he ""is the maddest of them all"" when talking about him and his brothers. He was initially expelled from the Iron Islands for raping Victarion's 3rd wife but since Victarion isn't in the series they'll probably make some crap up. One of the most interesting things about Euron is that he supposedly sails with wizards and warlocks, using magic to make him sail faster. Again, something that could be but could just as easily not be implemented in the show. He has a big interest in magic and dragons. He has sailed far and sailed a lot and is arguably the best captain in the world. We can safely say he will be a major player in the game.

I believe he will have a genuinely strong and hopeful plot, making us consider him to possibly be the eventual King of Westeros for a time, much like with Stannis. If he intends to marry Dany, she will probably have to accept him if she wants to maintain a strong enough army to ""break the wheel"" instead of risk having her army halved at war. If Dragonbinder is played, and Euron has a form of control over her dragons, she will have little choice. We all know Dany will not die since they need her dragons to kill White Walkers and Jon will eventually sit on the Throne, right? Therefore, Euron will have to be dispatched of sometime and I think this will be once winter has come (basically killed by White Walkers in a dramatic scene). 

As for Theon, he will probably catch up with Jon's story after he defeats the Boltons and stay close to him. I actually think he will develop greatly as a character we start to love and then end up dying as part of George RR Martin's ""bittersweet"" ending (but this could mean Tyrion dies).

""I have seen the storm, and its name is Euron Crow's Eye"".

first of all lets start at the end of s6 trailer we can see bran with a white walker, does it mean anything? probably not but stay with me.  
lets say bran is part of the ""cold"" team which is the white walkers unlike his brother, Jon Snow,which is probably on the side of the ""fire"" team since he will come back by the red priest melisandre (maybe not who knows).  
so my point is what if jon and bran will fight eachother? Cold against Fire, evil vs good.

2) When Tyrion gets Joffrey prostitutes in an attempt to make him behave less monstrously (""backed up from balls to brain"") he doesn't have sex with the girls, he tortures them by having them abuse each other.

3) He kills Ros in his bedroom with a crossbow and it is revealed that he is fully clothed.

Not referring to Jon Snow, but Arya.

So from Arya refusing to get rid of Needle, I believe that she refuses to fully 'become no one' and fully take on the philosophies of the Faceless Men. Instead, as is the consensus of the subreddit n general, she is using the Faceless Men as training for her own mission of revenge against the people who have destroyed her family.

Assuming, then, that she does not actually begin to accept the teachings of the Faceless Men and still plans to exit, how do you think she would do that? I'm pretty sure the FM would be pissed, or would they guess at her actions and wait it out with a grand plan in the works?

One of the possibilities I was playing with was the idea that the FM would know that the training forever changes you, and Arya leaving to murder a bunch of people would make her realize only the FM truly understand her and her bloodlust, and she would then return to the FM at the end of the series, to stay there forever, a sort of twisted version of a young girl joining a convent.

But how do you think she plans to escape with her life?

* What is the billing period?  Is a month long subscription 30 days, or is it where you sign up on the 23^rd, the month lasts until the next time the 23^rd rolls around?
  
* Does anyone know if it is possible to subscribe for say, two months, cancel your subscription, and then subscribe again?  I don't watch any other HBO shows besides Game of Thrones, so I don't know if having HBO NOW year round would be worth while for me.  

* Can you stream the show from your computer if you have an account, or does it have to be from a mobile device?

What are some storylines or plot twists that you think would be super interesting to follow and would absolutely increase the quality of the season for you, were they to happen? Please try and focus on naming things you'd enjoy seeing rather than based on how likely you expect those events to be.

For me, I have three:

1) Roose betrays Ramsay or in some way proves himself more competent than expected. To me Ramsay is a rather dull character in the grand scale of things. He just acts as an antagonist and that's that. I would personally like a Bolton scenario where Ramsay begins to fade out of the series, but perhaps Roose stays as a more stable-yet-still-menacing factor in the game. Roose's presence presents an antagonist that can remain calm and be peaceful for the most part, but is not above acting as a wild card when the situation allows for it. My #1 point with this plot is that I simply want to see *something* expected arise from the Boltons, and I struggle to imagine this from Ramsay alone.

2) Dany at least begins making her journey towards Westeros by the end of the series. I don't even like Dany, but it's obvious her plot armor is thicker than Fat Walda. If she must exist, then for the love of god, get on with it. Let's see her making preparations for Westeros AT LEAST by the season finale.

3) Davos either rises in ""power"" or importance, or meets his end. Davos is one of my favorite characters, and as far as things stand, I think this season either needs to solidify that he is infact important to ""the grand scheme of things"" within the overarching story of the series, OR he needs to die, which I actually don't fear because even though I like Davos, he's the only character I can name where I cannot possibly picture him dying with regrets. He seems like someone that if and when he does die, he's going to die on terms he's satisfied with. I think it's make it or break it time for Davos, and I'll be happy to see it either way. If he remained this obscure secondary character somehow without in some way being pivotal, dying heroically/honorably or becoming advisor to a new great power, I'd be rather disappointed.",51,17,False,self,,,,,

I was thinking that it would be an incredible twist for S6, if by the time Jon is back and fighting in the battle for Winterfell, that The Wall would also come down about this time. Just as the battle continues, we see the Hordes and cold coming for everyone and everything in its path. Winterfell is still some distance from The Wall though, but Jon manages to band the remaining people together, knowing that Winterfell is in a key position.

I'm thinking that once Ramsay sees the true scale of another WW massacre, he has no option but to talk with Jon, after Jon convinces him that it's a fight for the living. Here, much to Sansa's frustration and disgust, they are all held up in Winterfell together in an attempt to gather more time and a real plan. Perhaps the Wildlings have joined them too. Perhaps this is where they also realise Winterfell is holding a cache of Nukes. Okay, so maybe not them....but *something*. I'm thinking the old Kings in the Crypts have a part to play in this.

What do you think?

PS - On a side note, I do think that Wun Wun will be bashing in the gates of Winterfell for sure regardless. A bit of foreshadowing was in the part of the books where Sansa is building her Snow Castle and Robin knocks it down with his toy doll pretending to be a giant.",13,3,False,self,,,,,

Jon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4dohxy/all_spoilersas_a_reader_from_initial_release_i/,ZshadeZ,1459986668,"After plowing through Jordan's A Crown of Swords I went searching for Wheel of Time/Jordan discussion online on our old shitty bbs.  I was 13 and on summer break so I had time and dug through every theory and Jordan interview and bit of trivia I could. I found mention that Jordan endorsed Game of Thrones on the cover, and that it had just been released. The endorsement of my favorite author was enough for me, so I picked it up. I'd read dark fantasy at the time, but as we all found out at one point or another this was on a different level. I was hooked. I had already spent years constantly waiting for the next WoT release, was two years in to waiting for Sword of Truth novels, and ASoIaF joined the list.

Sword of Truth got old quickest. I still love the first novels, but the increase of preaching, entire novel from a new and nonessential PoV, and author's insistence that he wasn't a Fantasy author... eh. Still, I was excited when the series got picked up to be televised. And then Legend of the Seeker was released, and... fuck. Game of Thrones can be brutal, but it's hard to compete with how much that show butchered the series. I think it was directed by Ramsey Bolton.

I'd always wanted to see WoT turned in to a show, but at this point I changed my mind. When the Game of Thrones series was announced, I was nervous. Hell, I think a lot of us were. Then, it started. I wasn't 100% set on the casting in episode 1, but it was already worlds above LotS. I was very quickly hooked. The casting is phenomenal compared to any book to movie/show I've seen before. There have been changes from the novels, but it's really hard for me to fault the series in major ways, because it's ended up so far beyond any expectations.

The book release delays have been awful, as has the yearly wait for the next season of the series, but I grew up waiting for the next novel... and this is the last childhood series I have left. The show passing the novels where it has is actually perfect timing, because we're very likely to finally find out something awesome that's been hinted for decades, and much as I love reading instead of reading and imagining it we'll get to *see* it first and then get the extra details from PoV later. 

[Jon Snow](#g ""I guessed at a Jon's mother almost 20 years ago in the first few chapters of the first novel. The conversations we get in the first few chapters made it seem a bit obvious, something like [Chekov's Gun.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun). Bastard, bastard, bastard... Ned won't ever talk of his mother... Lyanna died around the time Jon was born... it just lined up. That and her story made the guess at his father pretty easy. There is a reason so many people have come to the same conclusion. The first episode of the show affirmed this belief. Since then nothing has come up on it other than more hints and teases. It's been an insane wait, and we're finally at a point where something pretty much *has* to happen this season."")

[paragraphs](#g ""My personal favorite is the idea that Jon revives on his own. Several mentions in the books about Targaryen rebirth through fire. We've seen Jon burned,  Targs killed by heat or burned after death, a lot of things that make it seem unlikely. But I don't believe that Dragons were living at the time or that the dead were burned along with Valyrian steel. The combination of the return of living dragons strengthening magic, a pyre, Longclaw, and his blood is something we haven't seen but I believe could be the root of the legends."")

[are good](#g ""More seemingly hinted at but not my favorite idea is Red Priest resurrection. I'm not discounting the possibility, I just don't see how it would progress the story as much as the first idea would. It could lead there, but it wouldn't be as much of a jump forward, and the series (books and show) really needs that jump. The Red Priest path would leave us pretty much where we are with Jon maybe gaining a little reverence from it but ending up tied to the Fuckwitch, whereas self/blood resurrection would finally give us a real focal point for resistance against the hordes of undead who are literally at the gate."")

Regardless of how it ends up, I can honestly say I've never been as invested in and excited for a show to start as I am for Season 6, and I'm actually excited that we'll be seeing this reveal instead of imagining it.",18,25,False,self,,,,,

My questions are:

1) I've heard a lot of people saying this is Sansa's season, i think Sophie even said that in an interview. **How do you think will she make it to the top?** 

I've seen some theories like she holding Winterfell after Jon takes it back and goes back to the Wall the fight the WW but tbh even if he goes back there how long will it last? He will probably get there, see the WW possibly breaking the Wall and go back running because he isn't going to win that fight since the man at the Wall will probably be Wights already. I don't think this would make Sansa great again.

I've also read she becomes LSH but i think that is pretty unlikely too although pretty awesome.

What i could see happening is maybe a Fookin Legend, Random woman and Jon type of scene where Ramsay is about to kill Jon and Sansa stabs him or something but seems too heroic for this show. (And i like it because heroes are predictable!)

2) **What can Bran do to become relevant? What will he do to become a real player?**

This topic really confuses me, probably even more because i haven't read the books.

So, we know he is powerful, no doubt on that but how will he take part in the history? So far all we know of him is that he can enter minds of even complex beings like Hodor and will probably tell Jon about his true parentage but then what? What will he do after that? This might be his role for the season but i doubt it since he will also be meeting the Night's King. Will Jon know he is alive by the vision or doesn't he get to know who sent it?

3) **Do you expect shit to go down between Ramsay and his father?** As the season goes on i think the tension in Winterfell will start to grow since Sansa is gone, Theon is gone and the Northern houses are gathering to help Jon. I think all this tension might end up in Ramsay pulling a stupidity similar to Theon's when he burned those kids and made it look like it was the Stark children which will result in family murdering.

I personally i'm a huge fan of the idea of Roose pulling a reverse and killing Ramsay when he tries to kill him. 

Yes, i would rather seeing Jon slaying Ramsay himself but that seems too obvious and this show is everything but obvious and in the end of things Jon will mainly look to avenge his brother's death and the Stark legacy rather than the hell his sister went through (although he will be pretty pissed and that could very well be motive enough if he finds out) and Roose was the one who started it in the first place.

**TL:DR** Do you think this will be Sansa's season? Why? **||** How will Bran affect the multiple wars in the 7 kingdoms + beyond the wall? **||**Do you think we will see murdering between Ramsay and Roose?

Thank you for reading and answering and have an awesome day!",18,12,False,self,,,,,

Yesterday I finally picked up a copy of GoT and started reading and holy shit, she's way worse in the book.  Not only is she even meaner to Snow and more prone to jumping to conclusions, but she simpers more.  But what's worse is the way she has completely fallen apart over Bran.

Perhaps I am biased because I also had a parent who would fall apart in a crisis forcing me or my sister to be the adult, so I'm really feeling for Robb who, in the book, is 14, not 17 like he is in the show.

A lot of them. I tried to use the spoiler-hiding formatting but they don't really work with a wall of text as big as this one.

They are just acting as links (as well as ignoring bold and italic font which is quite handy in these big chunks of text) when used with big partions of text as the paragraphs below. Also you just read this so you are quite obviously spoiler hungry."")

**I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE SPOILERS WERE DECLARED, DISCLOSED AND DESCRIBED IN A SUFFICIENT, CLEAR AND ABUNDANT MANNER. IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING SPOILED FOR YOU DO NOT CARRY ON READING**


With **Tywin Lannister dead**, Westeros has no longer a **single strong military leader** armies would rally behind. Tommen will probably die soon **making all of ""Robert's"" heirs dead**, ultimately ending the dynasty which will result in **Cersei or Margaery being the last ones with claim** (and a legitimate one) on the throne. *We will probably see the Vale scenes from books redone for Cersei/Margaery - tons of bachelors trying to get the crown through a betrothal. Or another war for the crown (lesser Baratheons trying to get claim of the crown etc)*, **weakening Westeros** even more.

This will be however a strong **foothold for Daenerys to reclaim the Iron Throne**. She is another person that has **legitimate claim** for the throne (and from everyone mentioned she has **the strongest one**). 

So either **Varys will organise the assassination of Tommen** to remove Cersei's power *(maybe Arya will carry it out which would bring her back to Westeros - after all she would be the perfect candidate as she knows the Red Keep well and speaks in Westerosi accent)* following with **Littlefinger doing the same to Margaery** to help Cersei *(or maybe killing Cersei to help out Margaery, after all Littlefinger is not taking chances so he will pick according to the situation, like with Ned Stark)*, or **the Sparrows will start an uprising**, which will be at first brutally suppressed only to **strike back stronger** as the Sparrows are **loved** by common people *(so basically Viva la Revolucion moment of GoT)* and **making Westeros** basically **a theocracy** *(with King's Landing having pretty much the same role as Vatican did during the crusades)*. 

Either way the leadership of Westeros will be **in shambles** with another winter at the door. And a long one. **Just paving the way for both White Walkers and Daenerys**. 

So yeah, **Tommen will** *most likely* **die**. **He is Cersei's puppet** and Cersei has **more enemies than friends**. *Well... come to think of it, she has only enemies apart from Jamie and maybe Pycelle and/or Qyburn*. **Cersei hates Margaery**. And there are **a lot of people who would prosper from her death**. Without her kids, Cersei is nothing, but still closer to the throne than others in the line, meaning that she is a widow after Robert Baratheon. **But with Margaery in play... she has no claim**. 

This is why I believe **Myrcella had to die**, because that would put a strong **claim into Dornish hands** and **Dornish** were the ones *(IIRC)* who **didn't kneel to Targaryens the longest**. **Margaery and Tyrells in general would be terrible Royal family** and Margaery would be **just another puppet to Lady Olenna**. Tyrells are **good schemers** but **terrible rulers** I believe.

I can also see **Littlefinger trying to get his way to get the Iron Throne in all the chaos**. So he can climb **the ladder** even higher. 

*Any thoughts or holes you find in this theory? Please share them with me, and correct me where I was wrong.*

*Also don't only Dornish accept females as heirs? So Cersei or Margaery would be Queen Regent but... there is no heir for the regency to withstand. Will Cersei try to push through Dornish laws in order to keep her claim? Wouldn't be the first time she would try something of the sort. Tommen's death would spur a lot of chaos which is what a lot of people are waiting for. Littlefinger especially.*",3,0,False,self,,,,,

In the season two premiere, we see Sansa save Ser Dontos' life. He is about to die; choking on wine, but Sansa comes to the rescue. This made me think. 

1. In season one, Mirri Maz Duur says that only death can pay for life. The parallels between the different storylines in this world are undeniable, this one, we may not have seen.
2. Sansa saves a man before he dies from WINE.
3. The Hound states ""What a man sows on his name-day, he reaps all year."" 

So, since Sansa spares this man's life, death must have it's due. Joffery Baratheon's life is taken in Ser Dontos' stead. 

Evidence

1. Wine is the reason Joffery dies, and the reason Ser Dontos comes close to it.
2. Sansa plays a part in both of their fates. Sansa is the one who saves Dontos, and also wears the necklace containing the poison used to kill Joffery.
3. Ser Dontos is the one who gives Sansa the poisoned necklace!

Joffery's death payed for Ser Dontos' life.

641,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-4-8,2016,4,8,15,4dv747,self.gameofthrones,[Mod Raven] Major Update to the Spoiler Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4dv747/mod_raven_major_update_to_the_spoiler_policy/,kjhatch,1460096068,"[The Spoiler Policy for /r/gameofthrones](/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide) has now changed.  The 2-tag system we have been using became too unwieldy, and after Season 5 the convergence of many book and show plot points has prompted a need for revision.  The title warnings need to be simpler and easier to follow, and we've worked the past few months to develop a new title spoiler warning policy to address all of the issues that have been coming up.  Here is a rundown of what has changed:

### Changed Post Scopes

* **The 2-tag system for post title scope warnings is back to only 1 tag.**  The [main tag][extended tag] pairing was meant to give maximum freedom to post anything while maintaining a very clear, specific spoiler scope.  Unfortunately too many people didn't get it, and it was common to see contradicting combinations of tags and posts with 3 or more tags. 

* **Title tag options are more restricted.**  The free-for-all options in the past has meant a lot of vague and unclear warning scopes.  The most common and simple form of each of the scope options has been chosen as the 'official tag' for each, and other variants are no longer allowed.  For example, a season/episode tag is done like this: [S5] or [S5E4].  Don't use [Season 5], [S5.04], [S05][E04], [S5/EP4], or any other combination other than [S#] or [S#E#]

* **[D&amp;E] and [GAME] no longer need to be paired with book/show tags.**  The 2-tag system is gone, so these tags should be posted by themselves now.

* **[LORE] has been replaced with specific tags for the other published books.**  Instead use [P&amp;Q] for The Princess and the Queen novella, [TRP] for The Rogue Prince novella, and [TWOIAF] for The World of Ice and Fire.  Just like [D&amp;E] and [GAME], these scopes no longer need to be paired with book/show tags and should be posted on their own.

### Retired Post Scopes

* **[THEORY] has been retired.** Most of the time when people want to talk about theories they openly discuss events from both the show and books.  The [EVERYTHING] tag includes [all theories](/r/gameofthrones/w/theories), and it's very clear that it means EVERYTHING.  So with the new structure there's no benefit to having a standalone [THEORY] tag anymore.  When posting about theories, the [EVERYTHING] tag should be used.

* **[ALL SPOILERS] has been retired.** It was perhaps the most common tag, but sometimes people would confuse the meaning of ""all.""  Theories and spoilers from the novellas were often posted.  While we were working on the /r/gameofthrones policy revision, the mods of /r/asoiaf came up with the idea to drop ""All"" and replace it with ""Main"" for a clearer label.  That worked very well, and /r/gameofthrones has adopted the same terminology.

* **[SHOW ONLY] has been retired.**  It was needed back when the show was still a long way from catching up to the books, but non-readers don't need the extra level of protection anymore.  Most of the main timelines have caught up, and there are plenty of divergent events anyway.  

### New Post Scopes
  
* **There is a new major tag: [MAIN SPOILERS]**. It includes spoiler events from the published ASOIAF books and aired GOT episodes.  Unlike [ALL SPOILERS], the Main scope does not include pre-release chapters, upcoming season trailers, interviews, or game spoilers.  It is only the published and aired events from the main storyline.  It works exactly the same way as (Spoilers Main) on /r/asoiaf.  **[MAIN SPOILERS] does NOT cover Season 6 information because it has not aired yet.  To post about Season 6, use [TV] or [S6] or [EVERYTHING].**


### What Has Not Changed

Everything else is the same.  Most of the posts here already use the common tags that remain in the options list, and comment tagging has not changed at all.  This update keeps what has been working great and cuts out the parts that aren't needed anymore.  For a more detailed list of the changes, you can check out [the wiki documentation](/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide/changes).

Season 5 - Still great TV, but some plots felt a bit rushed, such as the battle scene with Stannis and the Boltons. Also, the Sansa rape scene was unnecessary and not enjoyable in any way to watch, as well as the scene where Shireen was burned alive. These both occurred for little to no reason. But this season did have Hardhome, which was amazing.

Season 3 - Everything after season 5 is quite close, but I had to put season 3 here. Yes, the Red Wedding occurred, but to be honest, not a lot happened throughout the rest of the season. Still quite a bit better than season 5. Also this season has some amazing scenes and storylines in it.

Season 2 - This season had some great storylines within it, such as Arya's and Tyrion's. It also had Blackwater, which is arguably one of the best episodes. All in all, a good season, but it had a lack of shock and death, which are some of the factors that make GOT so great.

Season 1 - This season started it all, introducing all the characters thoroughly. It also had Ned's death scene, which was shocking and completely unexpected. One of the best season's overall, but not as good as the best.

Season 4 - The best season in my opinion. Great characters, great storyline, and great effects. Oberyn was a great addition and his death scene, although brutal, was really unexpected and well put out. All the characters had amazing storylines, except maybe Dany, who still has a good storyline. Some of the best scenes involved the deaths of Joffrey and Tywin.

He also sends The Mountain to kill Elia Martell and her children.  Why? 

The obvious answer is that they'd be a threat later on to Robert's rule if they lived, but Robert wasn't actually interested in the throne and also they'd make far more valuable hostages.  As it was, Dorne refused to bend the knee to Robert.  Tywin is a very intelligent man, surely he could see that it was far better to keep them alive as hostages than to murder them.  He could have taken over raising them, groomed the boy and married the girl to one of his family, securing more power for himself than just by owning Robert, who was a terrible king of a fractured kingdom held together by his marriage to Cercei (one of my favorite scenes is them laughing about this later)

What is stopping these dudes from Qarth from going around and taking down armies single handedly and conquering Essos?

Hey all!

With the offseason coming to an end, I figured i'd make this post i've been meaning to do. I'm in a band and wrote this last year when season 5 was ending and I was finishing up book 4 at the same time. I hang out in this sub pretty regularly sporting a Davos flair.

The song is about a citizen of Westeros who's living in the Riverlands at the time of Gregor Clegane and Nymeria's wolfpack's terrorizing of the Riverlands, but it also includes a piece of Arya viewing the Riverlands through Nymeria. The nameless citizen in my imagined story encounters The Brotherhood Without Banners and becomes a worshiper of The Lord of Light, as he sees no other way to cope with the terror.

&gt;Princes and Queens and terrible dreams

&gt;Keep hearing the howls and i know what they mean.

&gt;There's something i found i swear it's keeping me well.

&gt;Open your eyes. The dark recoils when it shines.

The Chorus is vaguely relatable but it isn't really specific to the story.

&gt;What if you wanted to stay What're gonna do if i just go go go go away

Our citizen begins to recruit followers as the destruction worsens.

&gt;Billows of smoke and i'm the only that knows.

&gt;So just keep holding me close i shiver less when we hold.

&gt;Somewhere they are the pieces are there.

&gt;Someway they know and the threads never tear.

The bridge relates to Arya dreaming of the Riverlands and alludes to her eventual blindness.

&gt;Thought riots come in the night

&gt;They shorten my life a minute at most.

&gt;Dead quiet builds in my eyes,

&gt;envelops my mind, and grins when they close.

That pretty much sums it up! Not overly involved but i was really happy when was able to make something that drew inspiration from the series.

I will edit in any charcters I remember and I am open to people convincing me I am wrong and a fucking twat. I am not doing this to not be yelled at anyway, this will get downvoted to oblivion.

1. Cat. Alright, so her hatred for Jon is a VERY good reason to hate her, considering how little he deserves it. In the books she has got no reason for this and that is something I very much don't like about her (also bear in mind I haven't read the last two books but I didn't know how to tag this for the entire show and 3 books while also doing theories since I am expecting people to do them so if you could not spoil anything from AFFC and ADWD that'be great). But in the show the scene with the dreamchatcher and the ""all because I couldn't love a motherless child"" gives her a little bit of likeness from me, just enough for me to sorta understand her. But the rest of reasons for why everyone hates her I just don't agree with. People hate her for imprisoning Tyrion but she didn't mean to in the first place, and she was fairly certain he tried to kill her son based on the evidence. And the other things are just her being a stereotypical mother. I can't remember everything that gets her hate so if you think I'm wrong on something please post in the comments.Anyway I don't really hate her and I never have.

2. Theon. Yeah I give up on the whole alphabetical order thing. Anyway, he is hated for betraying Rob. I can't say I liked it, but I understood him. In the show he is more welcome in the Stark family than in the books and he appropriately takes more time to think about it in the show. But he was stuck between two families, his own one and one he lived with. He wants to prove himself to not be a weakling and GOD he is so misunderstood by everyone in the show, in the books, IRL and GOD DAMN IT I just get him and don't think he deserves the hate. His regret in the show is also another thumbs up for him from me.

3. Sansa. I don't know, I always cared what happened to her, I don't get the people who didn't give a shit. She ain't the best but she's alright.

4. Olly. The real one. The whole reason why this post will get downvotes. And that is: I never went Fuck Olly. I, again, understand him and think it's Jons fault he didn't inform him, or anyone for that matter. I mean, for fucks sake Jon, how hard is it to say ""if we don't let them in they'll come anyway but as freaking white walkers"" and to everyone on the wall? Sure, some people would still be mad but they wouldn't all gather to make swiss cheese out of Jon. And wildlings killed his family! I mean, if somebody killed my family, ""peace, love and having fun"" would be a much worse arguments than ""look mate, if we don't do this, a big ass horde of freaking zombies will be even more big ass because they will kill these fuckers and be bigger than yur mum"".

- Later in the [House of Black and White Theme] (https://youtu.be/p18hNVMDQwY?t=106) you can hear a version of the theme that played during [Jaqen's scenes at Harrenhal](https://youtu.be/4l4bgX3qY9g?t=61). 

- When [Yoren confronts the city watch officer](https://youtu.be/Ml9OTVjIie0?t=82) the Night's Watch theme plays, which is also only 3 notes long. I'm not musical but it also seems like [Jon and Ygritte's theme](https://youtu.be/pyAUFtFL1pk?t=153) uses the same note pattern..?

- [Littlefinger's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0bp32opLxI) originally most people thought to be a Lannister theme because it was played during the Season 1 scenes related to the investigation of Jon Arryn's assassination. As the audience came to associate it with Cersei because we suspected her to be behind the plot. But eventually it started to be played when Littlefinger was onscreen, which is appropriate because he is the actual culprit. 
- Dany has 3 different themes, [the Dothraki one from early on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AMGJmpqfHA), [the triumphant theme that stated playing in season 2](https://youtu.be/Z01N1V4quTw?t=89), and now the rising 2-note theme that started playing more often in season 5, for example [Blood of the Dragon] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcLPCTEUHeg) and [Dance of Dragons] (https://youtu.be/S9e_INLnJts?t=94). It seems like the current theme is inspired by the first 2 notes of the early theme, from what I can decipher from [this earlier post by /u/NLevyMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1e0t7d/seasons_1_2_a_game_of_themes_all_of_the_musical/).

How the actor portrayed the character, how the character was rewritten for the series, disappointments pertaining to book characters being left out (at least to this point and possibly completely left out), and everything else. 



*Tywin* - I think Charles Dance was born to play this role. He gave life to a character I didn't care about in the book. If I met him in person I'd forget I wasn't speaking to Tywin Lannister. Some of the most flawless acting I've ever seen, even with his limited appearances.



*Loras* - This one kills me. I don't know if I was misinterpreting his character or what, but in the book he seemed like one of the most honorable, skilled, devoted men in the realm. In the series he's just a slutty stereotype. What's worse is that Finn Jones seems to be a really talented actor playing a character that was ruined in transition from book to series. 



*Tyrion* - This major change actually pleased me a lot. They basically turned him from a deformed goblin into a handsome, intelligent, charming dwarf. Again, really good acting helps make this change even better.



What does everyone else think?

At worst, they're just odd writing choices or characters not being competent, but I don't even think it's that. I think there are perfectly simple explanations for these two issues. *If I am flat wrong about any details I mention please correct me*


**Issue 1) The Unsullied appearing to be too weak when confronted by the Sons of the Harpy.**

The Unsullied are possibly the best battlefield fighters in the world. That doesn't make them invincible. They are being used as a police force in Meereen. This isn't something they are conditioned much for, and it especially doesn't help that it gets so routine for them that they aren't as battle-sharp or prepared for sudden attacks, especially in closed-spaces. The Sons of the Harpy use guerrilla tactics to get the advantage on them. Even the best militaries of our world's history have suffered from these tactics. You might remember the American Revolution, or even think modern day - The United States has the most powerful military in the world. That doesn't mean a roadside bomb or a random mass shooter couldn't take out some Marines who are at a diner, or even soldiers at a military base
It doesn't matter that most of the Sons of the Harpy don't have combat experience. A 13 year old with a knife could sneak up on and kill a trained combat veteran if the veteran wasn't expecting to have to face combat in that moment.

**Issue 2) Jon Snow and the Wildlings coming back to Castle Black from Hardhome instead of Eastwatch.**

By the time the battle at the wall took place, the NW had about 100 men left. After the battle, about 50. That's 50 men to 19 castles along the 300-500 mile wall. (My understanding is only Castle Black and two others were manned, which were the ones furthest to the east and west) except I believe this changed after the battle at the wall, as there simply weren't enough men to run the place afterwards, so it was worth abandoning the other two stations to have a better-run Castle Black. This would mean that Jon Snow would know that there was no one at EastWatch to open the gate to them, and even if there was, could this single man (or like three men) prepare food and build enough chamber pots etc to handle all those wildlings that Jon was bringing back? Is Eastwatch even large enough?
To me, it makes perfect sense why Jon would have taken the wildlings to Castle Black instead of Eastwatch.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Don't mind me if you saw it before I just joined Reddit. 
So, in both books and show Syrio Forel says to Arya ""There is only one God, and his name is Death"". And later, in S02 Jaqen, out of all people in the camp, calls Arya to help him. Is it because he knew her before? And later, in S05, Jaqen tells Arya sentence similar to first: ""There is only one God, and the girl knows his name"", maybe reffering to Syrio Forel's quote. If we look better at this, this is very possible as Jaqen can transform to everyone, and both Jaqen and Syrio are from one of 9 free cities + Jaqen and Arya are acompanied again in Braavos, Syrio's home city. And at the end, George RR Martin gave a document of a very ending of ASOIAF to screenwriters of the show, maybe with something about Jaqen being Syrio, and maybe that is the reason why both actors, Miltos Yermelou (Syrio) and Tom Wlachila (Jaqen) are Europeans (Militos - Greek and Tom - German) with similar speach :)",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Since Arya is part of the Faceless Men, and here's a quote describing the limitation regarding her becoming an assassin of the cult from the Wiki: ""...they only assassinate targets they have been hired to kill and may not choose who is worthy of the 'gift' by themselves."" Now I know that Arya is one stubborn little girl and she has every possibility to kill, though for a price, well what if some antagonist pays her to kill a significant someone she has a connection to, or a protagonist, like Jon Snow or whomever it may be that could really effect her and the story dramatically, and if she does not obey (and she never will), she'll only dig a deeper whole into suffering (maybe mute or deaf, though I know it was for a different reason that she goes blind in the book). Overall, what I'm trying to say is, she cannot kill whom she pleases to, only those who others has requested, so basically she can literally kill anyone ranging from Daenerys to Cersei to Jon and between but it is up to someone else to decide, I think that she's completely been manipulated from vengeance to join the Faceless Men and unfortunately now she has screwed herself over. What do you think may happen to Arya in the next season of the show, would she be a recurring character or more than a force to be reckon with, or that she must kill her loved ones?

Let's have a look:


Extinct Houses:

1. House Baratheon: Robert, Renly and Stannis are all dead. Robert has no real heritage with Cersei. Shireen was burned to death. House Baratheon has completely disappeared. Only possibility of a rebirth would be if the king at the end of the series legitimizes Gendry, wherever he is.

2. House Clegane: Sandor and Gregor have both died. Gregor has returned but as a mindless zombie with a different name (Robert Strong), whereas Sandor is probably returning as a faceless champion of the Faith. House Clegane is lost.


Houses in danger of Extinction:

1. House Arryn: Robin will die, c'mon, we all know it. House Arryn will die with him.

2. House Targaryen: Daenerys is the last Targaryen, but she is a woman, so the house dies with her. Unless Jon is somehow legitimized by some king as a Targ (if R+L=J is true), the Targaryen are gone forever. Or maybe Aegon will appear this season?

3. House Tully: Edmure and Brynden are the only Tullys left. One is a hostage and the other is under siege. House Tully is in danger right now.

4. House Tyrell: I think it's very likely that Loras will die, and the Tyrell name will effectively fade with Margaery, since there are not more male heirs in the family.

5. House Bolton: The North Remembers, and I'm sure this season Ramsay will manage to kill off the son of Roose Bolton and Walda, then he will probably perish in the Battle of Winterfell  (with Jon Stark, Rickon or Sansa leading). House Bolton will surely disappear.

6. House Lannister: Tommen has to die, Cersei will follow him but not before killing Lancel. Jaime can't have heirs. We also have that event of ADWD (Super Spoilers here: Kevan will be killed). Tyrion is the only hope of House Lannister.

7. House Mormont: Jorah, the only male Mormont left, is doomed to die of greyscale. Only alternative from him: somehow marry Daenerys and make a son with her. 


Houses that will make a comeback:

1. HOUSE STARK: Because ""THE FUCKING WOLVES WILL COME AGAIN"".

So I was thinking about the Azor Ahai thing and a lot of it would potentially make sense for Jon Snow:

* The Bleeding Star: For this point, I'm thinking about the last shot of season 5, when there's a 30 seconds zoom on the corpse, blood goes up in a linear manner as if it was a  flying star. I don't think D&amp;D would unintentionally waste 30 seconds on a corpse just to show us that there is actually blood.

* Reborn amidst smoke and salt: Here I'm thinking Melisandre being the smoke (Lord of light and fire), and Davos being the salt (he used to be a pirate).

* Darkness gathering around: The night watch betraying him and gathering around him.

* Also he's supposed to be a prince: if R+L=J is true, that makes him a prince.

* Has a song of ice and fire: Again if R+L=J is true, then he's a Stark (ice) and a Targaryan (fire).

In books 2 and 3 while war is raging in the Riverlands, a lot of the smallfolk were expressing how this would never have happened under ""good king aerys' rule"" and it did seem that his reign was marked by peace and prosperity for the common people...most of his insanity was a result of his interactions with nobles (tywin's work as hand of the king+defiance a duskendale+Varys wispering in his ears) and in turn his wrath was mainly aimed towards other nobles, he was known to burn lords that displeased him but not peasants, he was paranoid that Rhaegar wanted him dead..etc He became a cruel and sadistic person towards the end but he wasnt a bad king as far as the 99% was concerned, and furthermore his actions can be seen as a continuation of Aegon V efforts to bring the nobility down to the advantage of the smallfolk (in a twisted, cruel but ultimatelly necessary kind of way)...well yeah he did try to burn KL but at that point he was basically a puppet in the hands of the Alchemists and Varys and Pycelle and had gone batshyt crazy, but independently from that, I feel like he had been conditionned and manipulated (sometimes on purpose sometimes not) to become who he was and in a lot of cases he was right to be paranoid, the main noble houses of the continent were slowly uniting thru marriage exluding the dragons and rhaegar DID want to depose him..any thoughts?",3,3,False,self,,,,,

based on [Alt Shift X's 'Who is Azor Ahai' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3o2LqFZcGU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=121), we get a list of requirements. The first three are born under a bleeding star amidst salt and smoke. Davos was basically dead after the Blackwater but was saved by men serving Stannis. This occurred during Clash of Kings when the Red Comet was visible (it might have been seen disappearing by Bran in the last chapter). This could be called a rebirth with the salt from the sea and the smoke from the wildfire while under the bleeding star.

Next is Lightbringer, which could be any Valyrian sword, like Longclaw [which Davos draws in the season 6 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuH3tJPiP-U&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=86). The possible sacrifice required for the sword to be Lightbringer could be his four oldest sons (only son in tv series) killed by the wildfire in service to Stannis [from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos_Seaworth).

Azor Ahai is supposed to wake dragons from stone. Stannis has Targaryen blood and resides on Dragonstone until Davos convinces him to sail north to The Wall.

Finally, Azor Ahai must have Targaryen blood. We don't know about Davos' lineage except he is the founder of his house. 

This is from page 227 TWOIAF-

"" Orys Baratheon, known now as Orys One-hand (Wyl of Wyl cuts off his sword hand) rode forth from storm's end one last time to smash the Dornish beneath the walls of Stonehelm. When Walter Wyl was delivered into his hand, wounded but alive, Lord Orys said, ""Your father took my hand. I claim yours as repayment."" So saying, he hacked off Lord Walter's sword hand. Then he took his other hand, and both feet as well calling them his ""usury"". Strange to say, Lord Baratheon died on the march back to Storm's End of the wounds he himself had taken in battle, but his son Davos always said he died content, smiling at the rotting hands and feet that dangled in his tent like a string of onions. ""

a Davos Baratheon with a mention of onions and son of Orys One-Hand, founder of house Baratheon and rumoured bastard of Targaryen blood [source](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Orys_Baratheon). Could Davos Seaworth have been related in some way to this Davos like the passage above hints at?

If we are adding in three heads of the dragon, then he could be joined by Jon and Dany. Assuming Jon has Targaryen blood, this would be three heads. Dany provides dragons, Jon gives Lightbringer (Longclaw) and Davos has shown he would make a good ruler. Dany has struggled with being a ruler while Jon doesn't seem to want to rule so it could work out better for everyone this way. ",54,50,False,self,,,,,

Rule?  If the north remembers plot to overthrow the boltons happens this season, then the umbers would name rickon Lord of winterfell.  But is he old enough to rule?  Much like Tommen, I think he would have someone rule in his stead (I'm referring to book Tommen that is, who is much more content to play with his cats than rule westeros, not that I blame him).  

Now judging by Sophie Turner's recent comments that sansa will be a ""boss ass bitch"" this season, do you guys think she might rule in his stead?  I'm aware that she has said similar things like this in the past that amounted to her character getting shit on yet again, but I'm very hopeful this season that that will not be the case.  What do you guys think about sansa possibly being lady of winterfell?",22,12,False,self,,,,,

After watching the new trailer released today I noticed something which I havent seen anyone else pick up on so I thought Id share my theory. At 1:18 Ser Davos is talking about the pending White Walker invasion to someone in a hall with an unknown sigil that looks like a rampant bear on a gold field (a similar design to the Baratheon sigil) This made me think he could be on Bear Island talking to Lady Lyanna Mormont.
I believe Ser Davos travels to Bear Island in S6 and is asking for assistance from the Lyanna, because;

1. He knows whats coming and needs all the help he can get
2. Bear Island is halfway between Castle Black and Winterfell
3. He is seen protecting the body of Jon Snow; which shows loyalty to Jon, and If the Lady Melisandre resurrects Jon (which we all hope) he could become a Stark as his death has freed his vow to the Night's Watch. Davos may still have the legitimization that Stannis offered Jon and as hes the next oldest ""Stark"" alive after Robb's death, Jon is now the new King in the North.
4. Also back in S5 10 year old Lyanna Mormont sent a Raven to Stannis saying she wouldn't assist him as she and her house are only faithful to the ""King in the North whos name is Stark"" and now Stannis is dead and IF Jon is resurrected AND becomes the new King in the North, Davos could be there to call the banner men.
5. at 1:41 I see the same sigil on two seperate banners and I recall Ygritte saying that Wildlings don't use sigils so I belive the Mormonts have rallied to the King in the North's call for help and joined the Wildlings at the Battle at Winterfell against the Boltons

first things first: I just watched a few DiCaprio Films and I wanted to try something ""new"".
So I decided 5 Minutes ago to watch an hopefully awesome Series! But before going on IMDB and sites too look up how good a Series like GOT really is or what it is about in the first place, I'm rather going here first. I live in Germany and heard the Series Name ""Game of Thrones"" pretty often so it just came to my mind to finally start it.
(btw. I'm sorry for my terrible English skills since I'm 20 years old and a German Idiot heh)
So, what should I expect, what is this series even about ? ( I heard about some Vikings or.. urr pls don't kill me If I'm completely wrong here) and should I know something before I start to watch?

1) We now know that the Umbers are fighting with the Boltons. It looks like the Mormont's are going to be the loyal house that rallies to the Stark's side of the fight. Rickon and Osha are at the Last Hearth in the books. 

2) It makes the most sense in terms of the battle context. If you are fighting an army of Stark Loyalists and Wildlings, who better to put on a cross then a Stark and a Wildling.

3) We now know that it won't be Tormund, Davos, Brienne, Pod, Umbers, Stannis. Not many choices remain.

4) I know some people think it will be Roose and Fat Walda, but that doesn't make as much sense. As sick as Ramsey is he is also strategic, why would he piss of some of the remaining members or the Bolton army who liked Roose. Also - why would the Starks or Wildlings care if Roose was flayed, they'd love that?

5) Game of Thrones Episode 9's are always bittersweet. It seems far too upbeat if the army of noble Northerns and Jon defeat the Boltons. They are going to pull the rug out on the audience somehow, and this show is not above burning children in public places.

This show was a nice little escape that I needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4ecefz/everything_new_to_this_sub_i_watched_all_five/,sailsouth_,1460403894,"I think the catalyst for me finally getting on board with the show, was the season six finale of The Walking Dead. In several threads, people kept mentioning the Red Wedding. I think it was brought up because of the way a big event from the books was properly handled in the tv show, whereas a big even from TWD comic was not properly handled in it's tv show. Anyways, that finally pushed me to watch this show.

I enjoyed it a lot. But it did take a few seasons for me to actually get into. I think I was skeptical at first because I'm not really a big fan of fantasy. I was when I was younger. I think I can give the fantasy genre another try, right? 

I'm a big fan of House of Cards, so this show sorta reminds of that. HoC is by far my favorite show, ever. Embarrassingly, I feel really attached to it. I suffer from depression, so I tend to use that show to escape. That's weird, I know, but it sorta helps. It really inspires me and keeps me motivated to work harder. Since it's now in the off season and because I have no control, I binged all the episodes in about two days. I've been feeling pretty down, since then. I felt like I have nothing to look forward to. This is scary because sometimes I feel like if I have nothing to look forward to, then I'll end my life. Please don't think of me as selfish. I really can't help these thoughts. 

I guess I'm lucky I read so many negative reviews about the season six finale of The Walking Dead. It led me to a very interesting show. As soon I finished the last episode of season five, I immediately looked up the trailer for season six and read the comments on this subreddit. I feel excited again; inspired and motivated. It's a nice feeling. 

What a like about this show pretty much sums up what I like about House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire( another HBO show with cursing, violence and nudity &gt;:)) is that he characters are very real people. From the best kinds to the worst kinds(looking at you, Boltons ...). I cannot believe how true Ben Wyatt from Parks and Rec was when he said ""...It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts. They're telling human stories in a fantasy world."" This is very on the nose, that it's scary, haha :P 

After each episode I watch, I read the corresponding discussion thread. Oh man, so many comments that I wanted to upvote, but couldn't :( This sub has some funny folks. Also, I'm kinda glad the show is now ahead of the books. There were so many comments about the books that made absolutely no sense to me. It's was pretty confusing, especially considering this was my first time watching the show and I'm trying to get used to all of the characters. This might come off as harsh, but I'm glad I won't have to see any mentions of the books in future episode discussion threads. But I can understand the enthusiasm by the book readers :)

I look forward to experiencing season six you good folks. Thanks for reading and take care!

P.S when I said that I was new to this sub, I mean that I actually subscribed after I finished catching up, despite the fact that I read episode discussions. I hope that still counts... please don't flay me :0",10,6,False,self,,,,,

I hope that they will follow the book and make it so that we see this beloved character and the choice itself. Other option is that they will cut her (like they cut another fan favorite..

After watching the new S6 trailer it's obvious that the lords of the North and the Wildlings are making a run at overthrowing the Boltons and restoring House Stark.

After watching the trailer a 3rd or 4th time an idea popped into my head: What if Sansa is the queen that takes everything from Cersei? It's entirely possible that she could be made Queen in the North if the Boltons are [hopefully] crushed. And certainly Sansa is out to avenge her family and could do so with the help of Baelish, which would involve taking vengeance on the Lannisters.

It seems to me that the end of season 3 signified a change in direction from the producers. Largely with the number of recurring minor characters.

Thoros, Anguy, Beric Dondarrion, Gendry, Rickon, Osha, Balon, Blackfish, Edmure, Walder Frey, and perhaps a few others from the series all disappeared near the end of season 3 and have yet to return.

I know some characters like Rickon and Walder will return in season 6, but we've never quite seen such a substantial non-death departure in relevant characters. 

I simply wonder: is there perhaps a reason for this? Did season 4 begin D&amp;D's true separation from the book's path, and their first step is to change their plot focus? ",5,6,False,self,,,,,

I know most of his heroism was seen by only a few haters, but their was a point where whole city chanted ""half man, half man"", surely this most have become some sort of story told by the commoners after a seige? The eye witnesses saw the king bail, saw Tyrion step up (who's dwarfism makes him very recognizable, even from the last row) and go out to battle.

And the wildfire?? That was genius, changed everything. Thousands of men, gone before they hit shore. After the damage mostly archers left to fight the ground war they never trained for. I think it could be argued that without Tyrion, the Lannisters would not be able to hold Kings Landing for his fathers reinforcements. On top of all that he gets his face sliced so obv he was in combat if there were still doubters. 

Then season 3 starts and now the consensus seems to be that Joffrey was the battle hero? Tyrion is being treated like crap by the fam, probably crappier than ever.

So I think I'm missing something... Does everyone hate Tyrion and get mad at any success he has because he's a dwarf? Or is it something deeper/something I'm not getting? 

Why is Tyrion not a respected war hero?!

It looks to me like Melisandre knew well ahead of time that Shireen's sacrifice would be required and she told Selyse about it and possibly got her on board.

Could this mean that this also happens in the books and is therefore pretty important to the story? And given that the Lord of Light looks to be one of few deities who is real and has power(going off of Melisandre's chapter in ADWD, her repeating Ygritte's line to Jon, and in a non Mel example reviving Beric Dondarrion) could the sacrifice ultimately not be in vain?

Almost all of us; with a few exceptions that is i'm sure, think it would be melisandre bringing Jon Snow back to life. Yet once i saw the episode title, i knew that wouldn't be the case. Considering Mels convenient arrival at the wall just before Jon's stabbing, plus the fact we know that red priests/priestesses can revive the dead... it just seems too obvious for me.

My alternate solution being not that Mel that brings Jon back, perhaps she'll attempt a resurrection but ultimately fail due to her lack of current faith or misuse of R'hollers power. Making her undeserving of Beric's ability.
Which leaves only one other magical option for Jon's revival.

Bloodraven and Bran.

In the new season 6 trailer 2, there looks to be a scene where the weirwoods restrain Bran as he experiences a vision. This makes me wonder if the he's being restrained to try and stop bloodraven from doing what he knows he must: 

Sacrifice himself for Jon Snow.

We all know only death can pay for life(So far that is). With his new apprentice Bran a whole season of training in and the children of the forest to teach him more, i don't think bloodraven is necessarily needed anymore. Not to mention the great bastard already knows hes dying, so i believe a targ loyalist such as himself would gladly give his life to ensure the male targ line(R+L=J) continues.

TL;DR: Mel doesn't resurrect jon with the words beric uses on thoros, or the magic from shireens burning(which i actually think will be the way it happens in the books) Instead; Bloodraven, knowing his death is inevitable and his apprentice capable, chooses to sacrifice himself to bring back the last of the male Targ lineage. 

Lemme know what ya guys think, Im a tad drunk and i know there's definitely tin foil here for sure, but I haven't seen a theory on here in a while, mostly just news of the show. Figured id post one out of good fun since the show premieres in a few weeks.",19,0,False,self,,,,,

Jon is now dead and we've all basically agreed that he's coming back. We also know that Starks have magical abilities. We see it in Bran in the show, but in the books its clear that Jon has similar abilities to Bran though he's much less powerful. I think that while Jon is dead he's going to experience dreaming similar to Bran and will ""meet"" Ned in these dreams and will learn his true parentage.

I was answering some hypothetical questions about Gendry in another thread.  Someone was asking if Gendry came back, would Davos be able to prove he has Baratheon blood.  

&amp;nbsp;

Looking back at Gendry's show-only role, the ""proof"" I could find of his lineage was:

* John Arryn's interest in him and paying for his apprenticeship

* Ned, and later Stannis, confirm that Gendry looks like Robert

* The City Watch tries to arrest Gendry in the Great Bastard Purge of season 2

* Melisandre and Stannis are *apparently* able to use Gendry's kingsblood to bring about the deaths of Joffrey and Robb (and presumably Balon in season 6).  

&amp;nbsp;

My question is how did Melisandre know Gendry was Robert's bastard?  The Brotherhood could have told her after she arrived if they knew about the City Watch coming after him.  But if that's the case, she would not have been coming specifically for Gendry.  How did she know where to find one of Robert's bastards?

I originally thought Ned could have mentioned Gendry in his letter to Stannis, but [this seems to dispute that](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8262/8605178428_009b44c5e4_b.jpg), plus it wouldn't lead to his location with the BwoB in season 3.

Edit: I'm referring purely to Gendry's role in the show",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Will Sansa be Queenindanorf or will Jon be Kingindanorf when the North gets its shit together and unites to kick the Boltons out of Winterfell?

Sansa as Queenindanorf is problematic: so long as Rickon is alive, he's the next indanorf (Warden, Lord Paramount, King, whatever).  Of course, he's a wee lad, so someone will have to be his Regent, so I guess Sansa could play that role.  And she has the ""vengeance for Ned and Cat"" thing, so that should help her politically.

Jon as Kingindanorf is problematic; currently he's dead (.....for now..... /shifty eyes),  but if he finds his way back to the living, he's still a bastard, or if Howland Reed shows up, he's a nephew to Ned, not a son, plus he's also a Targ by name.  Would the North unite around him?  He's obviously got leadership qualities, and gingers are no match for his charms, so there's that.

Finally, how will Sansa and Jon feel about one another assuming they are reunited, anyway?  They seemed to be the most distant of all of the older children in the Stark household - even with their backstories since the beginning of the show, they may still not be natural allies.

So, I'm a single dad, and my son (5 and a half years) always requests that I tell him a bedtime story before he goes to sleep each night. Problem is, I'm a really bad bedtime storyteller. I know ""The Three Little Pigs,"" but that's about it (and it bores me to tears). I'm also not good and ""making up"" stories on the spot. So, a little while back, I decided to tell him the story of how the Starks happened upon their direwolves (one of the first scenes in both the books and the show). 

My son was instantly hooked. He asked questions about the characters, the setting, and so forth; he even begged me to tell him more stories from within the same universe. And so, ever since then, I've been telling him two or three stories a night, trying to touch on key plot points while still keeping the details of each story rated PG. 

Of course, this felt weird at first, given how ""adult"" ASOIAF/GOT can be. But at the end of the day, ASOIAF/GOT depicts a rich and vibrant universe full of interesting characters and compelling narratives. While it can be rather dark at times, there are issues it raises that even a Kindergartener can understand and think critically about (bastards/wildlings/women being treated as second-class citizens, the injustice of slavery, the meaning of honor, whether pure evil exists, what true power is, etc.), and certainly some stories that a child can relate to (many of the major characters are children or teenagers). While I wouldn't want some of the more ""adult"" content to be censored, I figured I could come up with a ""tame"" version of the story that would still allow kids to enjoy a lot of it.

And my son DOES enjoy it-- and not just for the  knights, castles, dragons, and so forth. We just made it through everything that's been released so far (mostly following the show storylines, since they're a bit simpler), and now he's made me start over from the beginning because he loves it so much. It's amazing how much he can remember (characters like Jeor/Jorah Mormont, Syrio Forel, Roose Bolton, Lysa Arryn, Gendry, Balon Greyjoy, etc.). He even had a Kindergarten assignment the other day where he was instructed to tell someone a story from memory, and he chose to tell me the same story about the direwolves that I first shared with him (he got ALMOST everything right, save for the part where ""they all lived happily ever after""):  https://youtu.be/si9eSP9uapc

But now I'm wondering... how can I make this better? He enjoys seeing photos of characters (or carefully pre-screened video clips), but I wondered if there would be a good way to compile a sequence of stories/supplementary material more geared toward children. Is there anything out there that could help? Right now, I have to read through plot synopses online to make sure I get the details/order of events correct, while also filtering out things that would be inappropriate for his age (incest, rape, gratuitous violence, etc.). I'd love it if it were all in one place. 

Has anyone else ever tried sharing ASOIAF/GOT with their kids? How did it go and what was your approach? What resources have you found?",12,6,False,self,,,,,

One topic that came up was Sansa and The Virgin Queen (Elizabeth I). I thought that there were some great similarities between how Elizabeth conducted herself as a queen and carefully crafted her image, and the direction that Sansa's arc could be taking her.

The two main points are:

1) The 'Virgin' title - Elizabeth I was known as the Virgin Queen because she took no husband, and boldly claimed to be married to the realm. She is remembered as one of the most powerful and accomplished queens in English history because she never had to share the throne with a man. I know that Sansa is not a virgin, but I can see her taking on a role like 'Virgin Queen' if she becomes Queen of the North. Certainly, her interactions with Joffrey and Ramsey would make her very sceptical of marrying again, and allowing herself to be a weak prisoner of a man.

2) Clothing and Image - In the commissioned paintings done of Elizabeth I, she has carefully crafted the clothing she wears to be impressive and formidable, to remind others of her power and might. She also manages to blend feminine clothing with masculine touches in order to create a balance of both King and Queen in her image. So far, we have seen Sansa begin to start using her own clothing to create a stronger and more striking image. There was that scene where she is sewing in the Eeryie and then appears wearing that badass outfit with feathers &amp; the spiky necklace to begin her journey with Littlefinger. In the newest trailer, she is shown wearing an outfit embroidered with the Stark sigil, and it looks very much like armour even if it is just a dress (I'm not sure which it actually is).

What do you guys think? Is GrrM taking inspiration from Elizabeth? Or is my love of history just making me look for similarities lol? I keep seeing lots of people theorize that she might take on the role of LSH, but I think this seems more plausible from how the show has been progressing so far. ",18,8,False,self,,,,,

Here's how I think it is going to go down:

Sansa and Theon have escaped Winterfell by jumping from the walls into a snowbank. I think that Brienne, remembering her duty to Sansa after executing Stannis on the battlefield, will start trudging back towards Winterfell and run into Sansa. Brienne and Pod will somehow manage to spirit her and Theon away into temporary safety, probably a village inn somewhere nearby. 

In safety, Brienne will explain that during Sansa's time in King's Landing, that she came into her mother Catelyn's service and promised to find her daughters and reunite them with her family. Brienne, knowing how brutally Sansa was tortured by the Lannisters (and is technically, together with Tyrion, still *Westeros' Most Wanted* for kingslaying) will not be exactly forthcoming with the fact that she was also tasked by a seemingly redemptive Jamie Lannister to find her and keep her safe.

So where is Brienne, Pod, Sansa, and Theon off to? I think they are headed straight for Riverrun. Brienne can't take Sansa back to Winterfell without an army, and nowhere else seems to make much sense - at least she has family in Riverrun, even if they are currently deposed by the Lannisters and the Freys. 

I think that Brienne is naive enough (and in love enough) to believe that Jamie has her and Sansa's best interests at heart. Brienne will return to Riverrun assured that Jamie will ensure Sansa's safety. I think that Sansa, desperate and with nowhere else to turn, will allow Brienne to talk her into becoming a protected ward in Riverrun so she can be reunited with the Tullys, at least. What else does she have? It is probably her only real chance at this point. 

However, I think that Sansa will eventually find Oathkeeper, the Lannister reforging of her father's sword Ice, on Brienne or in her belongings. Sansa will assume the entire rescue attempt was a charade to get her back to King's Landing for execution by Cersei and panic. Sansa is somehow reunited with the Blackfish, who upon hearing that Sansa has returned to Riverrun, spirits her away to the Brotherhood Without Banners stronghold. BWB will make Sansa their famous, beautiful, and vengeful figurehead - just like Lady Stoneheart. 

And now that Sansa has her army behind her, is back in the Riverlands, and is feeling betrayed by anyone she has ever put the smallest amount of faith in, she will take up LSH's mantle and start hanging Freys for the Red Wedding and terrorizing Lannisters in the region. 

Sansa, backed by the BWB, will eventually locate and secure Brienne and Pod and have them both executed for treason. I think Jamie is going to be torn about returning to King's Landing or blazing out to find Brienne before she is hanged by Sansa, but will be too late. Oathkeeper, and ultimately Brienne's keen sense of loyalty, will be what gets her killed in an ultimate twist of irony. 

This could be the way that Sansa finally gets her agency; she controls a mercenary army and is finally able to take revenge on everyone that has ever wronged her. Instead of Sansa triumphing with a pure spirit, I think that we're going to see Sansa go all Boudica warrior-queen on everyone and take back the North by force. ",6,1,False,self,,,,,

On to the question. I'm rewatching the show in preparation for the upcoming season, and I noticed something somewhat strange. Earlier in the show there is a bounty place on Daenerys. (This was around the time that Ned and Robert were arguing about killing Dany) If I am not mistaken, since Varys had ""birds"" across the Narrow Sea he was the one who told them that they wanted Daenerys dead, correct? Well fast forward to season 5 and now he and Tyrion are on their way to her, and apparently he supports her right to the iron throne. I understand he does support her, but why exactly did he place a bounty on her? Furthermore, perhaps I'm mistaken, but didn't he tell Jorah they place a bounty on her? If that's the case, did Varys know Jorah had actually sided with her and stopped spying? 

Maybe I have my story line all mixed up. Please correct me if I do. Thanks! ",5,1,False,self,,,,,

So i have watched the trailers tons of times and it is well know that Brienne is in the riveralands based on the trailer. Now obviously her plot is by far the greatest change to book character so hard to say, but we know her values and identity in that sense hasn't changed. So I think that Brienne would never go to the Riverlands without fulfilling her oath to find Sansa. Since she is hot on Sansa trail and wouldn't got to a completely different region without saving her. I say this, there is a chance that Brienne spares Stannis and goes to the rescue of Sansa and returns her to Jon with Stannis, thus fulfilling her oath and can move on to saving her love Jamie. Brienne wouldn't leave the North without saving Sansa so she had to if she went that far south, only other possible reason is when Jon requested Davos to ask Northern Lords for help he told Brienne to do the same which is very unlikely. 

Otherwise i do think there is a chance that they showed the Frey in the trailer because LSH first intro scene will be killing abunch of Frey at once. Cause let's face it the show doesn't have the subtlety and slow build up the book has, far more big battles in the show and bigger reveals. So they could have it be LSH tells her to go to the riverlands, but once again why would LSH go so far North when all of her enemies are in the south. Unless she could be the one that kills Roose but who knows.

The usual thought is the most logical option is the best option, and that being Brienne saved a Stark and thus she was able to go after her personal agenda at this point, which is Jamie. I would also like to add, could be a Brotherhood member that kidnaps pod, and then who knows what happens after that, cause the books sure dont say.",5,2,False,self,,,,,

From that vantage point, I offer a crazy theory that probably will not come to pass, but consequentially precisely may. The major death of Season 5 was Jon Snow, but through various leaks it's all but confirmed that two plot points will come to pass in Season 6. The first is the resurrection of Jon Snow, a decision that on the surface seems to be a cop out that would invalidate the permance of death in this world, but upon further understanding is actually crucial, because only through death can Jon Snow be released of his vows to the night's watch and be able to become Jon Stark.

Which leads me to the next plot point  through various set photo leaks, it's become known that Jon will attempt to reclaim Winterfell from the Boltons. And this is where my theory comes into play. Everyone expects he'll prove successful in his efforts, the Boltons will get their comeuppance, and the Starks will once again rule Winterfell. But when has this show ever had anything satisfying like that remotely happen? Has it not thrived on nothing more than the reversal of expectations? 

Jon Snow died at the end of Season 5. In the first episode of Season 6, he'll be brought back to life. But my theory is this: at the end of the season, in his effort to reclaim Winterfell, he'll be killed once again for good. It's the only death nobody would ever see coming, and a death that actually would make tragic sense thematically. I really hope I'm wrong, but that feeling of dread that I could be right is why I feel I may be. 

What do you guys think? Any chance this theory holds weight? Or do they genuinely intend on keeping Jon until the end for the sake of the story they're planning on telling?",12,0,False,self,,,,,

So I finished watching three seasons of goths histories and lore, the way house Tyrell is introduced in three seasons intrigued me like in 

1st Season only a hint about the former king of Reach is given hinting his pleasure seeking nature.

2nd Season it is just described that House Tyrell rose to power when the king of Reach went to with war with Targaryans. Lady Margery disapproves his decision and says something like he should have consulted his stewards but then again may be he did.

3rd Season it was disclosed by Lady Margery the cold calculated planning of House Tyrell knowing that all the other noble houses were not suited to govern the Reach they would have become the Lord Paramount of Reach and so they manipulated the King of Reach by saying it would look bad for his status(cowardly) to not to war against Targaryans.

The last line of Lady Margery saying ""House **Tyrell** will manage the harvest and keep the seven kingdoms from starvation like the good stewards we once were &lt;black screen&gt;Just ask House Gardner(former royal family of Reach)&lt;black screen&gt;"" is it hinting that even though they seem like noble people taking care of people but they have a dark motive to progress at higher and higher standard than others well its not a dark motive but there is a grave fault in their strategy. I am intrigued by the thought process of House Tyrell but I have found one grave fault in there strategy they are ignorant of the fact that any misdeed done always comes back in amount immeasurable fold (karma). And their downfall if not in books but in reality can be assumed by the simple fact by looking at the way they handled seize of Stormland castle whose eventual result would have been the death by starvation for Stannis and his men well I am not a wizard to know how much Karma would have been accumulated because of such deed but I can sense that it would have been very heavy Karma for any person who did the planning for this action and the sensible enough soldiers realizing what they were doing. I find House Tyrell much mature than many other houses like Lannister, Greyjoy(stubborn, wild, non-learning, most karma accumulating), etc but I guess if they would have used some more mind and secretly tried to feed Stannis and his men without anyone knowing then it would have been much wiser but luckily for them Onion knight was in world to smuggle goods. I guess the more you think and as a last measure look inside for guidance the less karma you accumulate don't you see. ",3,0,False,self,,,,,

I reckon that Winterfell will be recaptured by Davos (maybe Jon if he's about) with the help of the wildlings, as to avenge Stannis and also if Jon is about, to reclaim Jon's home. I think that as the Boltons slowly start to lose the battle Ramsey(and the boltons loyal to him) will attack his father who would be in mid battle with the wildlings. After slaying his father he will then attempt to play the victim to Davos, saying he was never loyal to his father and that he married Sansa in an attempt to protect her and that he loves her ect..

Davos being the fair person that he is will call a trial for Ramsay (with the help of the northern banner men that retook winterfell) to find out his involvement with the betrayal of Robb Stark. During the trial (possibly with interaction from sansa) the truth about Ramsay will come out and he will call for a trial by combat thinking he can best any man in hand to hand combat. Then Davos names WunWun as his champion and Ramsey gets ripped apart.

I know it seems silly but what do you think, i think it would be a fitting death for such a hated character?

Like in the aftermath of the battle there were quite the number of riders dead and only Bolton's had horses.
How do they manage to gather that many men in, what I'm assuming to be, a medium amount of time that can match up to the Wildlings+other Northern Houses? I know that the Umber's might possibly be fighting for the Bolton's as well, but it just feels too unrealistic with the amount of men fighting for the Bolton's
Most of the Northern houses lost a good deal of men during the Red Wedding, and now after the Battle of Winterfell and with Davos putting the Northern band back together and joining up with the wildlings, shouldn't Team Sansa/Davos/Jon/Tormund have a massive advantage in numbers?

I have two theories, please consider and respond based on the nonsense running through me mind. (Base on the show not books to this point)


1st: Back in Season 5 Episode 2, Jamie finds Bron on the beach with his soon to be wife. He give Bron a scroll saying that Bron's betrothed will marry someone else. He promises Bron a better wife and better castle, let us assume Jamie keeps with the phrase 'A Lannister always pays his debts' this would mean, now that they are back from Dorne, Jamie will follow through. So who could he marry Bron off to that would be a better situation? Then it hit me... the Freys! The crown retains the power over the twins for at least another generation.


(Sorry Bron, this never turns out well)


2nd: This season is already setting a precedent with flashbacks (aka The Tower of Joy), so it would be fitting that we see the Freys as part of a flashback to the Red Wedding. So why flashback to this night? There is only one reason I can think of... do show what happens to Catelyn Stark after the feast.. and the eventual birth of Lady Stoneheart... is it that much of a stretch seeing as we are already anticipating another resurrection? In the trailer we can see Jaime in Lannister armor. We also see Brienne and Pod in what looks to be in Riverrun (Tully banners), then there is a scene with Pod getting choked, this looks to be the same location we see Jamie at (notice the tents and banner in the background). So why else would Jamie, Brienne and Pod be in Riverrun all at the same time with a reference to the Red Wedding?",14,0,False,self,,,,,

A quote from the book:

These are some recent quotes I found by Stephane Dillane (Stannis Baratheon). As a Stannis the Mannis-fan I'm still not cool with how (or why?) they rushed his death in such a silly manner. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it seems like Stephane Dillane doesn't really agree with the showrunners either. He seems to be confused about what Stannis' role was in the story, and I must say I agree with him. From 'House Twentygoodmen' to a family BBQ, to getting ambushed on an open field. It's incredibly sloppy. Stannis was my favorite character on the show, but the way they rushed from setback to setback only to end it with an incredibly anticlimactic death... they might as well have flushed his screen time down the toilet and spend it on another character.

What do you guys think?

Stephane Dillane's quotes:

&gt; ""I wish I'd read the books - I might have got a better idea of where it was all going,""

&gt; ""I just felt as if I didn't get it, and had I read the books, I might have had a better idea of the role of the character - what he was meant to be. It might've helped.""

&gt; ""I could've done with another year. **But as far as whether that character should've continued or not continued... or what the investment in him is, I really don't know.**""

(I have not read the books but read a lot about the lore and what was in the books but not in the show) I just can't help but wonder since the queen was killed after the wall was built did it make it so producing legit white offspring become a lot harder? Since a human man could fall for one I would only assume since we have yet to see a female white walker, that if there was one it would be capable of creating offspring? We have seen the night's king in the show turn a human baby into a white walker, but I don't think any of the regular whites could do this. In my opinion it is more of a guess anyways the night's king is the offspring of that first queen and human crow who had gotten together. Granted there is still so much mystery behind the whites that they could just choose one themselves or do some kind of dark ritual. I only say that it is the offspring because threw out most the show there so much fighting over who the rightful ""king"" is and who's blood is pure, it seems almost fitting that this would be there son who is trying to take what he perceive to be his kingdom and cover it in ice. ""and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well"" This quotes taken from the book so they did in fact do it, they also ruled for 13 years. It never mentioned a child but considering how little is know of the white walkers and how secretive they are, it wouldn't surprise me if the white queen had planned this so that she could have a heir more powerful then herself made from the seed of man. what better way to plant there seed of defeat then with a unholy demon ice baby Hitler.

There are a few fringe characters who are dead in the books and not in the show, who may be more likely to die but it's hard to say.

That's why I came up with the idea of having a fantasy thrones league. It's basically fantasy football meets bingo but with much more death. Before the season starts a bunch of my friends are going to put 5 into a pot and then one by one we get to select 3 notable characters that we think is going to die by the end of the season. The likely ones will get snatched up fairly fast, but then it gets a lot harder.

The idea is the first person to have all their characters die wins the pot. If everyone still has someone alive at the end of the season then it goes to the person or people with the most deaths.",13,19,False,self,,,,,

My name is Assaf, CEO of yes.no. Our goal is to get fans to get together and ask their heroes the questions they've always wanted to. We know that Emilia Clarke (for example) cant answer 10,000 fans who are each asking 1 question (often duplicate/low quality), but she might be willing to answer 1 good question upvoted by 10,000 fans. (We wouldn't be promising answers though of course.)

As opposed to Reddits AMA (for example), were not a one-off Q&amp;A session, but rather we aim to be a continuous channel for communication between fans and heroes (allowing heroes to answer as little or much as they please, whether that be 1 question per week, any question with more than 1000 upvotes, etc). And at any given time it will be possible to see which questions are trending and popular.

It's look like that: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-NYq-7_yqIycGtyZ2pyUDAybFU

Id love to hear from any feedback and ideas as for which dominant figures from A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones you think might be interesting for the community. Specifically, other than the actors themselves, do you think producers/set and location mangers (like Richard Roberts - set decorator food prep) would be interesting for the a crowd-interview?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Many thanks in advance,

Aegon conquered begun his conquest of Westoros in 2bc and finished in 1ad. Roberts Rebellion was almost 300 years later, and the last dragon apparently died a 150 years before Roberts rebellion. 

So let's say the last dragon died during Aegon lll reign some 150 years before the events of GOT, how did the Targaryen Dynasty maintain their no1 position in westeros for over 150 years. Surely other houses would have seen a opportunity to take back their kingdoms. Was it due to the alliances that had been made that allowed the targayens to keep the power? Or maybe that the 7 kingdom system existed for so long at this point, that people didn't know any better any more?

Edit- Also the dragons that died 150 years before the events of GOT were very small and weak compared to their predecessors. Apparently they had the skulls the size of dogs. Which means the bigger dragons died out much sooner.",29,37,False,self,,,,,

My father recently started watching it. He didn't know about the nudity and stuff so he was pretty excited to watch it with me (I haven't told him that I've already seen it). I wanted to see if nudity would be a problem, so I let him watch the 1st episode without me. He finished watching it and I asked him if he had liked it and he said ""No, it's not my type of show."" Sounds normal, right? Well, I can hear him watching it atm. IIRC this is like the 5th episode. He clearly likes it, but doesn't want me to see some naked bodies. Which is stupid, I know. I'd love to watch it with him and tell him about all the lore and give him some info on it. It'd be really cool if HBO did a censored version.

In the trailer at 00:52 behind Ser Davos a Stark banner is visible. After this shot we zoom out to see a field with burning crosses (possibly containing flayed man) and a large army. Which makes it likely that there is going to be (as expected) a big battle for the north between Stark loyalists and the current Bolton regime in the North.


Before this shot we hear Sansa say: ""its all I think about, what was taken from me"" Shortly after which we hear Ser Davos say: ""There is no hiding from this we have to fight."" Next time we hear him he says: ""The real war is between the living and the dead"". Later on at 1:42 we see a shieldwall of Bolton man with the flayed man on their shields fight wildlings. During this scene we also see a lot of ragged/torn banners.


First of all, I don't think the wildlings will fight a ""southern war"" for anyone else than Jon Snow. Therefore, he must be resurrected one way or another. I think this is supported by scenes from another clip where Ser Davos defends his dead body. Why is there need of defending a dead body unless there is need of it in the future.


I think Jon Snow will lead an army made up of remnants from Robb's and Stannis's army combined with Wildlings to take back the North and leave it in the hands of Sansa. We know she is alive, she could have possibly escaped Winterfell with Theon (who could also bring men to fight through his sister). Furthermore, we have no evidence that they are aware of Rickon being alive or that the show characters know about Robb's will/testament making Jon lord of Winterfell.


Moreover, as shown in the previous season, Jon does not want to be lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, King of the North etc. Which makes it likely he will give Winterfell to the one remaining Stark he can find. After this he and the Northern army will turn to the wall to defend the realm against the white walker army.

Additionally, in other trailers/sneakpeaks we have seen Sansa in heavy fur cloaks which remind me more of Starks/Northerns than Boltons. Besides she looks very strong/defiant which makes me hopeful she is friendly territory and planning her revenge. Moreover, we also get to see the flashback where Ned finds his sister after giving birth to a child (most likely Jon Snow). So why would we now get a flashback of characters which are all dead presumably about a character they want us to believe is dead? Also this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYDRTQaqm3Q gives a good explanation about why Tormund looks really shocked and providing some evidence that supports their theory. It being that Jon Snow rides in to battle. 

This my thoughts on it, since I also refuse to believe Jon has really met his end. And it would mean no more direwolf scenes and I love those bastards ;D

I know that it's included in the FAQ, but it wasn't very detailed.

I did a quick google search, and apparently in the show...

- Arya's killed Meryn Trant (what.)

- Shireen and Myrcella are dead

- Sansa and Theon have fled from Rams-HOW DID SANSA EVEN GET TO WINTERFELL?! She's supposed to be in the Vale.


So, are these just fillers? They couldn't be, too many major plot changes... Is the show diverging from the books? Or what?

Anyways, the show creators said theres nothing in the works right now, but they've talked about possibilities before. Via Watchers on the Wall:

The showrunners have discussed the possibility of spinoffs before with EW, based on how rich Game of Thrones is with characters.  Benioff discussed the subject with EW during the making of the third season, mentioning Bronn as a subject with potential. He also said, We could do a great half-hour comedy with Sam [John Bradley] and Gilly [Hannah Murray]. Its an embarrassment of riches.

Bronn is awesome  he kicks ass. But SAM AND GILLY? Man, I don't think I could handle that. I think my vote would be the prequel with Robert's rebellion. Any other dream spin-offs?",12,2,False,self,,,,,

*S4E2 Love watching Joffrey die, though it's always tough to watch Tyrion take the blame. I really hate Cersei at this point.

*S5E8 I mean really, how could it not be? If not nothing else watching Jon Snow's look of surprise when his sword stops the white walker.

So:

Roose Bolton changes the name of his bastard son to Ramsay Bolton so he's no longer considered a bastard. If this was possible why did Ned Stark never changed Jon Snow's name to Jon Stark?

In the Season 2 finale, Sam finds a marching White Walkers army. Why didn't they kill him?

What happened with Gendry? He escaped from Stannis but we never saw him again. I don't want spoilers from the book, I just wanna know if we're supposed to for him to show again or if we must assume he just didn't make it.


EDIT: I have another question, when Jaime frees Tyrion and he picks up a crossbow and kills his father in the bathroom, why there were no guards near by? I tought important people, specially the related the King, and specially the Lannisters, were always followed by guards

But in GOT/TWD, I don't know how they're gonna give us that feeling, the feel of closure. The thing is, no matter what they do, there would always be danger ahead. In TWD there will always be zombies, so if a character survives the ending, it doesn't really make you feel he actually survived, since he could die, like, some days later; and killing all characters doesn't sound like a good idea either. In GOT there will always be murders and wars for the Iron Throne, so noone is safe, ever...

I'm fine with that, but I'm concerned that the White Walkers and Daenarys will reach the seven kingdoms almost simultaneously. The problem I have with that is that I would much prefer to see Daenaerys in Westeros about a year before the White Walkers, so we could see some conflict between her and the great houses of Westeros at first.

Since season 2 I've been looking forward to see how the people of Westeros treat Dany upon her arrival and I'm excited to see battles between her and some Noble houses that don't want her interfering. But with how the show is developing it starts to look more like we'll never see that kind of conflict. It seems like many people in Westeros are already well aware of the White Walkers and since it will take at least until late season 7 for Dany to arrive, all people will already support her and her dragons to fight against the Walkers.

On the other hand, there is also possibility that Dany reaches KL in last episode and dragons start to burn the city down and ignites (accidentally?) the wildfire and here we go!

It was really boring. I got half way through season 2 when is stopped. Walter's family life is boring, staying with the same characters for ages is boring. No one cares about the wife of the DEA agent, we want to see some cool cartel physcos, like Tuco.

I've heard about it, I've seen some references, a few gifs, but even then didn't really connect them to anything in my mind. Just, you know, things that flow past when you have no real interest on the source subject. I suppose I'm pretty lucky in that regard, often not caring about something you still manage to spoil it for yourself if you were to ever watch/read that thing later on. Especially when it comes to the more popular media.

So one day I just decided to watch it. Not even sure why, but just dove right in and here I am. Though at this point I'm not sure if there was anything 'lucky' about going in blind. One other thing I remember hearing about was 'the red wedding'. Paid no mind to it, forgot about it even. Well..

I expected deaths. I expected deaths of likeable characters. I coped with Ned's death pretty well. I thought I was ready for a death here and there. But.. how can you be ready for everything that followed? To see everything be torn apart in minutes.. and it was such a feelgood episode too.. right until the doors closed and the music changed.. I swear this'll give me trust issues in the future. 

I'm rather late into the game to share the pain with everyone else, but I've found that writing my thoughts down helps me cope with it anyway, hah. Really right now all I wonder is whether there's anything left for the wolf. Any sort of.. 'rise from the ashes' kind of thing? I wish. But with four children scattered all over (though each with interesting stories of their own) the odds for anything like that happening don't seem very high.. at all. Some of you probably know things and I guess I'll see it myself later on. Another thing I realized that sucks about watching a bunch of episodes in one go is that after an episode like #9, it can be difficult to focus on the next one :D Though I must say it was pretty 'relieving' to see Arya stab the shit out of someone.

Anyway, see this subreddit in two more seasons when I'm up to date with at least the TV part of the story. ..That is if no one I like dies in a bloodbath and I feel like writing about it again.. I'll probably take a short break from the show though.. some time to take it all in.

It matters in a lot of theories, or just minor discussions. 

1. It could be due to incest. Regardless of if you believe Jamie and Cersei are children of The Mad King Aerys, the simple fact is that in the ASOIAF universe, incest often seems to result in madness. 

&gt;""The Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. King Jaehaerys once told       
me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land."" - A Storm of Swords, Chapter 71

Perhaps it's only the Targaryens, but as they're known to marry sister to brother, it seems that this is a result of incest. Jamie and Cersei are full siblings, and twins at that. That Joffrey is a son born of incest could have caused his madness. Tommen and Myrcella just got lucky on that coin flip.

2. It's due to Cersei and Robert's treatment of him. Robert ignores all of his children, to a point where some suspect he knows they aren't his. Cersei dotes on all of them, likely because they belong to Jamie. This combination of hate/love could have caused Joffrey to act as he does, acting out to get his father's attention at first, going unpunished because of his mother, and later because the cruelty is habit.

The problem with this is that we don't have any indication that Robert pays any more attention to Tommen and Myrcella, or that Cersei treats them worse than Joffrey, yet they don't show signs of the same madness their brother does.

3. A combination of both. Tommen and Myrcella have better personalities because they weren't as predisposed to it, but with capable parents Joffrey would have been a better person and king.

She was perfect on season 1, ok in season 2 but in my opinion her situation is becoming a problem as the serie progress. You do not have to be a genious to figure out that Arya Stark is going to be something of a ""bad ass assassin"" after Jaquen training and that she will take revenge on the people that made her a life a nightmare. We know Maise Williams quite well know and I really doubt she could pull it off. 

I know that people consider her as a good actress, especially when you take her age into account, and I agree, you could then argue that if she was playing it well until now, she might be ok in the future. But isn't she playing the same character for most of the show ? I think she is and while it is not her fault since the show requires it, it might be not enough to consider her a good actress. So far, all those ""bad ass scenes"" she played seemed a little goofy to my taste but I think it was ok since Arya Stark was supposed to be really young and unexperimented in the show so it fit. But except from crushing violently Trent's eyes, she never played the bad ass assassin side of her character, we have absolutely no clue she can look intimidating, mysterious, facinating and belivable as an assassin in the way Tom Wlaschiha (Jaqen) did. So in my opinion, yeah, it might be stretch to think she could handle the ""Arya Stark"" she is meant to be by the end of the show just because she is doing ok for 5 seasons. 

You also have to consider that character portrayal is not just about your acting abilities, you have to actually look the part as well. It is a subtle mix between the look and the acting qualities of the actor. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is a perfect exemple, he looks the part since he's believable as a grown up knight from a noble family and he can act as a cocky/dangerous person when he needs to. He is a believable Jaime Lannister from the start. Even his heartbreaking statue is believable. When you think of a young assassin woman trained by a bravos guild of killer, you imagine something along the lines of Tom Wlaschiha portraying of Jaquen Hag'ar who killed it in its role. He is swift, mysterious and facinating. Those features reflect well in Tom's facial and body structure. Let's also not forget that Arya is also a Stark and that 1 : she's supposed to look like Lyanna, her aunt who was beyond beautiful and started a big war just because of it and 2 : she is supposed to possess some Stark features (grim face, cold look, intimidating...) like Jon Snow for exemple, the ""Stark"" member she is the most close with. So far, the more Maisie Wiliams grows, the less she looks like what I imagined Arya Stark would become : a fierce, mysterious and facinating young woman with some shade of beauty. 

I imagined an older Arya Stark more like this :

http://img12.deviantart.net/fd3e/i/2013/053/9/e/arya_stark_in_the_future_by_annamma-d5vsw0e.jpg

So far, Maisie Williams looks and sounds way too goofy to keep playing Arya Stark in my opinion.  

To me, they should have handled thing that way : 

Seasons 1 and 2 : Maise Williams as Arya Stark. 
Seasons 3, 4, 5, 6 : Recasting of an actress that can make the transition between Maisie Williams and the final actress.
After season 6 and her training in the Bravos Guilde : final recasting as a young woman more in line with what Arya Stark is meant to be by the end of the show. 

They could have keep Maise Williams as Arya Stark for all the seasons before the last re-cast as a bad ass young woman, but I think the change would have been too brutal for the spectators. A first re-cast before that could have... I am not saying she could not pull it off and give an ""ok"" portrayal of this bad ass assassin young girl, because well, you never know. We all remember the fuss about Ben Afleck being Batman, Ledger being cast as the Joker, Hathaway for Catwoman ect. We all know those people are still busy eating some crows. But I really doubt she could do it and even if she could, her look is still a huge problem.

When Tyrion crosses the narrow sea and ends up in Essos there is one scene (I forget which episode exactly) where he and Varys watch a red priestess speak about the prince/princess that was promised. The priestess says that daenarys is the chosen one. It is clear from the events of the show that followers of the lord of light do have at least some capacity for magic/are given power by someone else (Mel, brotherhood w/o banners). It seems odd to me that both of these women who claim to follow the same god would forsee the future differently. This could mean that: 

1.) Melisandre knows that Stannis is not the chosen one and deliberately leads him down the wrong path to help eliminate one possible enemy for Daenarys if/when she makes her way to westeros. 

2.) Melisandre interprets her visions incorrectly and consequently ruins any chance Stannis had at the throne and most likely dooming herself in the process.

3.) The red priest that Tyrion and Varys watch was incorrect in which case who the hell knows what is going on. 

Honestly, option 1 seems like the most likely possibility to me. This may just be crazy tinfoil hat theory but it seemed interesting to me, any thoughts?

This is my first post, so apologies if any of this has been brought up before.
I am currently reading the third book and have watched all available episodes of the show, so my sources for this theory will only be from the first two (and part of the third) books and the show.




#The Starks, Beheadings, and Swinging the Sword



&gt;The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that **the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword**. If you would take a mans life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.  
-Ned Stark, Game of Thrones, Bran I



Beheading is a recurring theme in ASOIAF, and it seems to be a very important one. **The very first chapter, beginning with all of the Stark boys attending a decapitation by their father, sets the tone for the entire epic.** Over and over again, the story is full of other pivotal moments involving beheadings - Robb beheading Rickard Karstark, Jon beheading Janos Slynt, Theons failed beheading of Farlen/Ser Rodrik Cassel, and, perhaps the most powerful moment in the whole story, the beheading of Ned Stark by Ilyn Payne.

The association between the Starks and decapitation is made very clear. The Starks willingness to swing the sword themselves, and the honourable way they deliver it, helps set the Starks apart as the protagonists in the story. This is highlighted most in the beheadings not performed by Starks. When Theon attempts to behead Farlen(Cassel in the show), he completely fails on all points - initially, he had no intention of swinging the sword himself, he kills a man he knows to be innocent, and emberasses himself by being too weak/unskilled to do a single clean cut and then vomiting afterward. When Ned is killed, Joffrey flippantly sentences him to death, while not having the balls to swing the sword himself. So far, **every male member of the Stark family past puberty has beheaded someone**, and looked like a king doing it (Im not sure about Benjen).


 **Maybe its Brans turn.**

#Bran, Greenseers, and The Hammer of the Waters

Clearly, Bran cant physically decapitate a man using his own body, but hes still a Stark and.. a greenseer. **Perhaps, instead of beheading men, like his brothers, he will metaphorically behead the continent of Westeros, by flooding The Neck, as other greenseers have attempted, and failed, before him.**

There are at least **two references to the greenseers flooding massive swaths of land**. Legend says that's how the land bridge between Westeros and Essos was destroyed:

&gt;""But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken...**The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land**, shattering the Arm, but it was too late to close the door.  
-Maester Luwin, A Game of Thrones, Bran VII

On the **greenseers attempting to flood The Neck** in the past:

&gt;""The histories say the **crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest** in the days when the **greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck**. It may be that they have **secret knowledge**.""  
-Maester Luwin, A Clash of Kings, Theon IV

Some interesting aspects of the above quote are that the crannogmen now live in the swamps created by the first attempt to flood The Neck, and the **secret knowledge** that is mentioned.


**Bran has a couple of crannogmen pretty close at hand.**

#The Others, The Dothraki, and Crossing a New Sea

Theres likely to be a pretty **good reason for Bran to flood The Neck, and thats the same reason the children of the forest tried it the first time - protection from invaders**. Against any army, a body of water is a pretty good barrier to help defend ones land. Plus, if timed correctly, it would be a pretty good way to take out a huge army in one swoop. But, we also have **two pretty important groups that seem either unwilling or unable to cross water - The Others and The Dothraki**. We dont know for sure if The Others can travel over water or not, and The Dothraki would have to cross The Narrow Sea to even get to Westeros in the first place, but flooding The Neck is the type of thing that could completely change the course of a war, or end it outright.

#The Freys, Guest Right, and the Wrath of the Gods

&gt;""Though once I had eaten at his board I was protected by guest right. **The laws of hospitality are as old as the First Men, and sacred as a heart tree**.  
-Mance Rayder, A Storm of Swords, Jon I

Perhaps most interesting is the impact this theory would have on The Twins and House Frey. The vast majority, if not all, of House Frey would be eliminated. **Bran would be passing the sentence that the Frays so badly deserve for The Red Wedding.** [Guest Right is a concept that we are told is sacred to both the old and the new gods.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV5txCNDco0) [The Freys even served bread and salt to The Starks prior to the massacre, a ritual symbolic of the extension of Guest Right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8K_GWbqw7k)  The blatant disregard for Guest Right was more than just unethical or frowned upon, **it was an affront to the Gods**.  They didnt just ignore Guest Right, they took a big, steaming dump on the whole concept, and the **Gods wouldnt let that go unpunished**.

There are two characteristics that are rather unique to House Frey. First, theres a lot of these pricks. **It is made very clear that there are a whole lot of Freys**, and that perv, Walder Frey, just keeps them coming. This is a point of emphasis in both the books and the show. **Flooding the Neck would possibly eradicate all of Walders offspring, wipe The Twins off the map, and completely destroy The Frey legacy.**

Second, **nearly all of the Freys power is derived from their location**. Other Houses have deeper reasons for their influence, The Freys just have a bridge at a strategically important location. If, indeed, Bran is bringing the hammer of the waters down to stop The Others or The Dothraki, The Twins could just be collateral damage. In this scenario, **The Freys source of all their power, their location, would also be the biggest factor in their demise.**

Lastly, **The Freys and Reeds despise each other**, and the crannogmen already have a possible association with this theory.

Flooding The Neck seems like the perfect way for the gods to hold The Freys responsible for such vile behavior.

#An Already Divided Land and the Living Westeros Metaphor

Westeros is already divided. There are some sharp differences between The North and The South. Genetically, people in the North are mostly descended from The First Men, while the south is more of a mix of the blood of First Men, Andals, and Valyrians. Religiously and culturally, people in the North follow The Old Gods and their rituals, while the south follows The Gods of the Seven and their Rituals. Additionally, there aren't many Weirwoods in the South, outside of Godseye, and, if the Gods are believed to be real, their power is essentially divided along The Neck.

Westeros is alive. Its fantastical magic-driven ecosystem is so grand, that ASOIAF is far more than a story just about people. The impact of weather, seasons, and natural occurrences in general, seem like they are often the product of some entitys will, rather than random occurrences. If we look at a map of Westeros, we see several names that emphasize biology as much as geography - **The Broken Arm of Dorne, The Fingers, Godseye, Flints Finger, Hearts Home, The Bite,** and, most importantly, **The Neck**. Now, this could just be a coincidence, given the number of places and names in the story, but lets assume it isn't.

Westeros has not exactly been acting like a model citizen. I mean, if the continent were personified as a man, it would have more than earned a beheading.


**Bran must pass the sentence and swing the sword as only he, a greenseer Stark, can.**

Thats not to say Brans motivation for flooding The Neck will be to punish Westeros for being an unruly continent. That would be stupid. I think, if this theorys correct, the beheading narrative is just an interesting one, and more of a metaphor than anything.

GRR Martin has gone to great lengths to create a plot that is, perhaps as much as any other story, centered around its setting. Hes made a land that is not only alive, but, and I know this sounds cheesy, possibly the main character of ASOIAF. It would be appropriate for a tale so broad and so epic to, not only forever change Westerosi society, but, permanently alter its landscape.
**Decapitation seems like a fitting fate for the main character of Martins saga.**   

 
    
**TL;DR: 
Bran, like other greenseers before him, will bring the hammer of the waters down upon The Neck, flooding it, and severing The North from The South. He would metaphorically behead the continent of Westeros. As Starks have a strong association with beheadings, Bran would be carrying on this tradition, albeit in a rather unconventional way.**


**This could be done to stop an army like The Others or The Dothraki, who dont seem to like water, and would likely wipe out The Twins and House Frey, punishing them for breaking Guest Right at The Red Wedding.**

Follow the swords...

I think it is clear the battle with the others will take place from the ground (with Valyrian steel swords) and the sky (dragons). The dragon glass is lost we are told.

Most of the speculation has revolved around who will control the dragons. But I think there are some clues for us  if we consider the swords.

Longclaw - I think Jon Snow will be an important foot soldier in the battle against the others (contoroversial, but why woukd an excellent swordsman be wasted in the sky?);
Oathkeeper - Brienne
Widow's Wail - Tommen doesn't strike me as someone who will become a great sword weilding warrier - he will either die or handover his sword to someone else. We know that Tywin wanted to regain a Valyrian sword for the family - he got two in the end - given that Jaime donated one sword to Brienne, that leaves this one for the family. There's only one realistic possibility - Jaime 

Therefore, I think Jon, Brienne and Jaime will form part of the ground force against the others.

Others to be confirmed as we find out who has the other Valyrian steel swords (tv)...

If true, it does leave a question about who will ride the dragons. I think there is a nice parallel with my theory above. A Targ in the ground (Jon) and in the sky (Dany). A Lannister on the ground (Jaime) and sky (Tyrion...). Is there another Tarth we have not yet met...? Or perhaps she gives Oathkeeper back to Jaime and Tommen loses his sword/or is stolen.

Finally, I think the king/queen will take part in the great battle. Based on the above, so far, the candidates are Jon, Dany, Jaime, Tyrion or Brienne (not likely). Basically all of the names mentioned already!",4,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm sure this has been asked before, but isn't Sansa still technically married to Tyrion?
I know in the show that  a marriage isn't considered valid until consummated, but in the books I didn't find mention, meaning that this has just not been mentioned or indeed an annulment could only be granted through death or in a trial.

Based on this... is Sansa still married, then? If this is the case, are there any theories on if this could become a plot point further down the line?
Is it possible, however ridiculous that Tyrion could become king with Sansa still as his wife?

- Stannis Baratheon

- The Tyrells (with their alliance with Renly Baratheon)
- The North

The Vale weren't going to get involved, Dorne unlikely also (if anything I think they'd side with the rebellion as no marriage had been arranged and the whole Elia thing).

They could have whooped them... literally destroyed them into a thousand pieces.

Hell, they almost were with Stannis' attack on the Red Keep, if the Tyrell's were backing them up they wouldn't have stood a chance.

I know it wouldn't make a very long series if this had happened but they really got off light. Stannis essentially made the crown the strongest it could be by taking out Renly, leading to a Joffrey/Tyrell marriage.

**Game of Spoils -- The Game of Thrones Spoiler Blocker Chrome Extension**

Greatly improved since last season, and now open-source!

[&amp;rarr; &amp;rarr; &amp;rarr; Get the extension here &amp;larr; &amp;larr; &amp;larr;](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gameofspoils-game-of-thro/ipjhpmdippbajafafidlinjjmfkdamci)

&gt; Detects and blacks out any posts on Reddit or Facebook, tweets on Twitter, or stories on Google News that mention Game of Thrones or many other GoT-related terms, such as 'Winterfell' or 'Targaryen'.
&gt;
&gt; Any blocked spoiler can be viewed by the brave of heart by clicking on the blacked-out area-- this will cause the post to be gradually unveiled, giving you about 3 more seconds to glance away!
&gt;
&gt; On Reddit, posts mentioning GoT are permitted only if you are directly viewing a GoT-themed subreddit, such as r/GameOfThrones or r/asoiaf. The idea is to only block spoilers from the front page or other subreddits like r/television or r/funny, where users are not so careful about spoiler tags.

&amp;nbsp;

Coders! please feel free to contribute and improve the extension-- visit [the Github repo here](https://github.com/stu-blair/game-of-spoils), and we can all work together to avoid spoilers this season!",11,16,False,self,,,,,

Also, he still remains the ice in a song of ice and fire. The trailer for S6 where we see Bran turning around (most likely in his vision) to see the night's king, is actually Jon, as night's king. Bran is the only one who knows this through his visions and has to let others know and take steps to kill the night's king to protect the realm.

So, in my view Bran has a big role to play in the end game too. As does Dany as she is ""fire"".

Mercenaryness,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4fel30/everything_a_theory_about_bron_and_his/,jeffdschust,1461020401,"(*Dangit, I spelled Bronn's name wrong in the title*)

My girlfriend (Jennifer), a reddit-friend (Kevin), and I have been re-watching and recapping the entire TV series via podcast (links below).  As we headed into Season 4 and everything surrounding Tyrion's accusations, and trial, it really got me to thinking about Bronn in a new light.

Things the show makes reasonably clear:

- Bronn was helping Jamie at Tyrion's suggestion, but not for free.  Nothing wrong with that.
- Once Tyrion had need for a champion, Bronn was suddenly scarce and took days to respond to Tyrion's summons
- Bronn was then engaged...
- Tyrion said that Cersei was involved in arranging that marriage, and Bronn didn't deny it.

Now, the show goes into very little detail behind this engagement, and as our recurring guest (and book expert) Kevin noted, Tyrion didn't have to search for a champion in the books - Oberyn volunteered before Tyrion even asked for the trial by combat.

So maybe Bronn's engagement and his decision not to champion Tyrion are unrelated in the big picture, but there's something bugging me about the events before and during the trial:

- At the pre-wedding party, Tywin demanded Shay to be sent to his tower.
- After that but before the wedding reception, Tyrion had Bronn escort Shay to a departing ship.
- Bronn assured Tyrion that this was done and that he wasn't followed.
- Shay showed up at the trial, which means she was never on a long boat ride.

So I ask you all:  Did Bronn start working for Tywin and/or Cersei in secret?  Did he full-on ***betray Tyrion*** when Tyrion needed him most, and deliver Shay to Tywin rather than get her on that boat?

I'd love to discuss here, but please do also give a listen to our Season 4 recaps where we stumble into - and then explore - this idea.  If Bronn is a betrayer, will this come back to haunt Tyrion as the show marches on?

Before I get into that, after reading the leak concerning bastard bowl and seeing no mention of House Manderly, I thought instead the casting call for ""Fletcher"" would be a Wyman Manderly type character for House Hornwood. We already know Lyanna Mormont is head of house Mormont, but Hornwood was a wild card and maybe D&amp;D would make the head of Hornwood the Manderly character. This still did not make any sense on why House Hornwood would flip at the last minute and have their full force at the battle with the Starks, someone flipping at the last minute would entail a late arrival. I don't think the extra who leaked the details knew exactly everything, considering the crackdown on spoilers D&amp;D implemented this season. After thinking about this and seeing the trailer I noticed something very interesting.

Banners in trailer (http://imgur.com/a/hvcZc)


In both of these pictures are two banner like flags. The first one is a black creature on what seems to be a dark green field. What jumps out at me is what looks like 3 claws and a tail stretching back to the left. What Northern house matches this? House Reed. Take a look at the sigil that the series uses and compare it to the banner in the photo:
Reed Sigil(http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Reed)

The second one is a mystery, at first I thought it was merely the back of the Direwolf with maybe a Blue tint with it. That could absolutely be the case with the first image, but on the second you can almost make out a fin, or the bottom of a mermaid. Could this be a house manderly banner? 
After comparing the banner in the photo, to the Manderly banner used on the tv show, there are similarities.
 
Manderly Sigil (http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Manderly)

The colors seem to just simply be inverted with the blue merman on a white field. If this has been spotted and discussed before I apologize, I just thought it was a really interesting detail and I wanted to see if anyone else seen what I had saw, or if its just simply a couple of random banners tied on to lances. If its the riders of the Vale, those two flags could easily be The Arryn Eagle and House Waynwood. Does anyone else have any opinions on this?

**TLDR**: Banners in commercial look like House Reed and Manderly, could they be coming to save the day late in the battle after Manderly flipped sides?",2,7,False,self,,,,,

Starting with when Tyrion is released from prison by Jaime, a divergence happens due to their final conversation. In the books, Jaime tells Tyrion the truth about Tysha, that she was never a whore and Jaime was forced to lie about her.

The Westeros intro is made in a hollow shell:
Maybe symbolizes what lays beneath?

There are giants and mammoths in the far north:
 (makes me think of ""The Smoky God""- where there are giants beyond the north pole opening , ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""- where the crew finds a giant herding prehistoric elephants below the surface and finally all those admiral byrd Antartica conspiracies/stories where they say he found a mammoth beyond the South Pole.

So if in the slight chance this was real could the others be reference to the Hyperborea people who were said to be from ""Beyond the North Wind"" and the only way they could attack the surface inhabitants would be to emerge from the land curving inwards from the south or north of the Earth on Westeros.

If that's true then there is the possibility that a decent amount of giants and mammoths could still be alive unless they were all driven out.

Of course the surface of Westeros could in no way be a Dyson Sphere unless if there was a orbiting planet and a mini sun within it which would make night and day and block out the light from each other.

What do you think? Stupid theory? Maybe it inspired the idea of the Others for game of thrones? Maybe nothing at all?

Edit: One more thing this is what seams to be the North Polar point of Westeros Notice how the land curves inwards. Coincidence? Connection? Or just simply the shape of the model used?

However,  you'd have to be dead to not of heard of ""the red wedding"". I'm a non book reader. 

My reaction is odd.  I knew people would die at a wedding but I expected it to be the other one.  Honestly I'm just stuck because I knew something terrible would happen but I didn't know it would hit that hard.  In a way,  I'm writing this because I need a break from the binge watching. 

The look on the Mom's face will haunt me.  I can't even handle it.  It was so abrupt and so violent.  I am glad I didn't read the books. I literally cried for the last chapter of the fault in our stars. I can't imagine how much closer I'd feel for the characters with more time in them. 

I do love the show but good god,  that was *somehow* worse than I ever could of imagined. 


I'm trying to catch up before Sunday and I will have 2 seasons to go.  My heart is broken though and need to lay down before I continue.

Like most fantasy sports, each owner drafts a team (comprised of characters from the show), and those teams battle one another each episode in a round-robin format. Points are earned for things like killing, drinking and saying ""Hodor,"" and lost for things like being injured, getting sent to the Wall, or denying that winter is coming.

Some folks might find it distracting, but as a SoIaF fan and fantasy sports fan, this has made watching Game of Thrones even more fun. If you have a group of friends who might be interested, I invite you all to try it. Below is a sampling of our scoring rules, but of course you could add/subtract categories as you see fit. Feel free to ask for suggestions if you want to know what has worked for us.

I don't think we've witnessed a psychic vision on screen yet but I think the seer would only be able to observe and not interact, and if he was seeing his own future, he's standing erect so that takes away some credibility.

""Queen in the North"" is a phrase bandied around, as is the even more optimistic concept that she might be Queen of Westeros.  But I've seen  nothing so far in the show to suggest that's ever going to happen.  As far as I can tell, she's always been a pawn, even when she's temporarily thought that she was in control of her life.  Now that she gets control, I can't see how she's going to get anything useful done with it.  She has no (known/living) family, no wealth, no lands, and no armies, and no realistic prospect of acquiring those things (at least before winter sets in and makes it impossible).  

Why do people think Sansa will succeed?  I am genuinely curious.  Theon suffered a lot.  Jaime suffered a lot.  Stannis suffered a lot.  But I don't think any of them are going to become King one day.  What makes Sansa different?

Smart writing always covers the ass, and that's done in ASOIAF/GOT by being able to say, ""well we had those couple scenes early on where we showed these really old heartless bastards up to some inexplicable stuff.""

A group of First Men who sought immortality and achieved it... at a price. Their king is so old his crown has frozen into his head. They have waited. 8,000 years. Long enough to become folklore. Their leader is cunning and patient. He knows what he wants and this time he won't be defeated. This time he knows what it will take to win.

For 8,000 years he's watched, waited and built his army. The funny thing is... despite all the ice and magic he's just another man playing the game of thrones. Another greedy wannabe ruler of them all. That's how he got in this position to begin with; forced into the far north, far away from the world he wants to rule.

His face looks as carved as a weirwood; hard and grey with deep lines and a permanent scowl. It seems as though he's been plotting and staring intensely for a long, long time. His friend, the long haired one killed by Jon Snow, looked about the same age. That is to say, thousands of years old. Unnaturally old. Magically old.

How many sacrificed children have they raised as warriors in preparation of their invasion? One a year is 8,000; 10 a year is 80,000, etc.

Magic is here because winter is coming. Winter is coming because it has been planning to return since it was here last and got its ass kicked. Do you think it waited out the Valyrians on accident?

Someone knows, though. Someone in Westeros. Or maybe Bloodraven. Or the Children of the Forest. Someone who was able to know the Others were beginning their long-planned attack, and begin a series of events that see dragonglass, Valyrian steel and dragons reappearing at a very inconvenient time for the Others.


Beyond the Wall, the enemy grows stronger, and should he win the dawn will never come again.

Anyway, I know a lot of you, like me, are re-watching some or all of the previous seasons in anticipation for Sunday night, so I came up with an idea... hopefully nobody has already done this. If so, I apologize. Instead of just saying what your favorite episodes are, or favorite seasons, I was wondering how it would be to do it this way: What's your favorite Episode One, your favorite Episode Two, and so on down the line, since so far every season has had 10 episodes. Here's mine:

* **Episode One:** Season One ""Winter Is Coming""
* **Episode Two:** Season Four ""The Lion And The Rose""
* **Episode Three:** Season One ""Lord Snow""
* **Episode Four:** Season Three ""And Now His Watch Is Ended""
* **Episode Five:** Season Two ""The Ghost Of Harrenhal""
* **Episode Six:** Season Four ""The Laws Of Gods And Men""
* **Episode Seven:** Season Four ""Mockingbird"" (I was so torn between this one and Season Three's ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" but ""Mockingbird"" won out with one of my very favorite scenes ever in GOT)
* **Episode Eight:** Season Five ""Hardhome"" 
* **Episode Nine:** Season Two ""Blackwater""
* **Episode Ten:** Season Four ""The Children"" 

Breaking it down like that, I guess it would seem Season 4 is my favorite so far! It was the first season I watched at the same time as everyone else, the first I had to wait for, and was definitely worth it. Season 3 probably had the most second place finishes of all the rest.

I know that HBO probably receives a lot of suggestions about the GoT Show itself. **This is NOT one of such.**

An increasing issue with popularity of the Show is that of *Piracy* (as seen with S05). 

This one idea could turn the tables 'round for the better of the show, the cast, the producers, the company, and *the Realm.*

**The issue**

* As soon as a new episode is aired, it appears on hundreds of websites available for download, without ads.
* HBO makes money for the show from advertisements that are shown in segments of few minutes throughout the Show (but on the downloads the show runs without the ads).
* HBO Go is a no-go for thousands of people, for whatever reasons, but downloads are easier to come by, without ads.

Basically, the problem is that the ads are lost in the downloads.

**Solution???**

* To make money by having the cast drink Coke or Pepsi? Not!
* To make money by having the locations show banners and boards with brands? Not!
* However, to sell ads that will be included as *non intrusive* watermarks of a brand for a few seconds or minutes on screen in scenes that aren't so important to have a clear full view (say a battle where the shots are changing all the time and have various focal points that are important, but to have these small ads on landscapes or scene changes).

**With a Show as popular as GoT, there are brands that would pay one million dollars to have their watermark logo on screen rather than a full commercial that will NEVER appear in a download.**

Imagine how many more people will see the ads this way? This will show that the brand has enough money and cares about us, the loyal viewers of GoT, and it is interested in providing goods or services that appeal to us.

**Ideas for potential brands:** *Another similar show, travel agencies, publishing houses, wine, interior design, banks, sports, universities...*

The potential is limitless, the only problem that could arise is that the ads become like Super Bowl live broadcasts, where the brands have more prominence and distract from the Show. Subtle works on the long run and is more efficient.

Best,

Agree or disagree?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4fn4un/everything_possibly_controversial_why_i_cant/,theivoryserf,1461156324,"I'll preface by saying I've not read the books, so perhaps it's different there. Also, I don't have anything against female leads - I find Arya, Sansa, Cersei and to a lesser extent Brienne really interesting. But I almost wanted to skip Dany's scenes/plotlines and probably will if I rewatch. My reasoning:

-She's a fantasy cliche. The reason GoT is enjoyable for me is that is eschews the Elfey-Dwarfey lameness that I feel most fantasy (with an ironic lack of imagination) descends into, with well-drawn, well-developed characters who possess motivations, nuances and an unclear morality. In contrast, Dany is a beautiful, blonde-haired blue-eyed Chosen One who owns three all powerful dragons that bust her out of everything and ridiculous plot armour in addition to this. What's more, she has a Heart of Gold and manages to rescue all slaves and convert them to her cause. This is borderline eye-rolling stuff and if the show were centred on her I'd be out already.

-Her plot is tedious as all hell, accentuated by it being essentially tangential to the central one. In the first series/season it ripped along and was genuinely pretty cool to watch as she struggled with the forced marriage, her own leadership and her awful brother. After that...it's gone almost nowhere. She's got an army, taken control, freed some slaves and is again struggling to be a leader. That's another season of development, not *four* - looks like it's taking a further detour in Season 6 too. A plot that is effectively a separate side-story with few noticeable effects upon the main plot needs to be just as or *more* interesting for it not to be irritating and jarring when we're ripped back there.

-Emilia Clarke is ok. But, imo, to counteract the two preceding points she'd need a massively compelling performance to make the Dany storyline interesting to watch, which it just isn't really. It's fine, serviceable but generally a bit wooden, earnest and one-note, which are pretty flipping boring characteristics for a protagonist if not surrounded by fascinating external events or characters.

These three factors make the whole thing a slog in my opinion. Thankfully the rest of the show is exceptional! What do you guys think?",135,89,False,self,,,,,

Not sure if this categorizes as that or not, but it's just to be safe.*

So, a few weeks ago of /r/asoiaf in the Fan Art Friday thread I [posted a few logos](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/48wqx3/spoilers_extended_fan_art_friday_post_your_fan/d0nesh4) that I'd been working on. I'm a big sports nut and a graphic designer, so having a go at making GoT houses in the sports style was REALLY fun. 

Well, I was planning to do the full set of Great Houses by the time S6 came around... UNTIL someone at work saw the logos and decided that we HAD to do something with our company for the upcoming season. So, the idea was born...

With the upcoming NBA playoffs and GoT S6 so close together, we decided to mesh the two. It's a 6-team basketball playoff with the Iron Throne as a reward. We had a lot of fun coming up with it all. There's breakdowns of players and teams, some snazzy supplemental videos, and some sweet looking logos ;). 

You can find it here! [Game of Hoops: Road to the Throne](http://playbook.draftkings.com/nba/game-of-hoops-road-to-the-throne/)

The caveat is that my employer is a daily fantasy sports company, so a lot of the content will be geared towards daily fantasy players. If you're a sports fan at all, however, you can relate.

Please check out our twitter/FB over the course of the week! We're gonna do breakdowns of every game in the tournament and new videos every day, so there will be more reasons to go back. I'm super proud of this and am so stoked I got to do some Game of Thrones stuff at work!


**TL;DR:** We fleshed out the idea of what it would look like for Westeros to have a basketball league.

Red Priests are now being able to bring back men from the dead 6 times and the dragons have been reborn however it is that link, dragons and Valyrian Steel, the many people find interesting and it has led many to hypothesize that dragons were used in the forging of Valyrian steel and that is why the secret of its creation had been lost.

So we know that Valyrian steel can Kill the WW and that it may have been made with Dragon breath, this leads me to ask, do we think that Dragon breath is the reason that Valyrian steel can kill the WW? ",3,2,False,self,,,,,

Have they come in contact with each other before the wall was built? Do the white walkers know they exist? If so, do they believe they are now extinct?

I know everyone thought they were extinct at the beginning of the show, so I was thinking maybe the white walkers believe this too. Is this a reason why they are deciding its time to make a move and head south?

One more thing: if it is white walkers vs. dragons in the end, how do you see that playing out? Do the white walkers have any way to attack the sky? It seems like it would be just dragons flying over, fire breathing and melting everyone.

I think some of you will instantly agree, some of you will want me banned from this sub, some of you don't give a shart. But I wanted to say it here, where I can maybe get some responses on the matter.

Tywin is a very respectable character. While it's true that he is one of the main antagonists in the show, he facilitates countless terrible acts and hates one of the most loved characters, who happens to be a pretty main character with some... erm.... shortcomings (I love Tyrion too btw), he does it all for reasons I can respect. Everything he does is to better the position of his family. The fact that when the series started he was already rich and powerful made it seem like he was a tyrant in this regard, but when you look at how he got there, it really only adds to my respect for him.

As far as I understand the story behind the Rains of Castamere, one of the lords under Tywin's father (Tytos) wanted to rebel. Tywin took it upon himself to put the rebellion to rest, both putting more power behind his name (something his father didn't do very well), and taking multiple houses completely out of existence. The rebellion was so famous that all it took was a bard to sing the ballad to shut any potential traitors down.

From the moment we meet Tywin, his persona is flooded with confidence and pride, often taking the form of a smug demeanor that has every bit of justification. He proves himself a great commander and leader (of people loyal to him). He (along with Tyrion) is one of the few characters who not only stands up to Geoffrey, but he prides himself on doing so. On top of all of this, they chose the most perfect actor, Charles Dance, to portray him.

Basically, while everyone is worrying about their lives and how to make themselves in the best position, Tywin is doing what needs to be done so that, in a thousand years when first names, personal accomplishments and acts of valor are forgotten, the Lannister name lives on.

Dragon seed's descendants: The were not all killed and did manage to ride dragons so it's possible they have descendants who haven't shown up yet

Blackfyre: probably in the possession of Aemon Targaryen

Ice/ Oathkeeper and Widows wail with Brienne and Tommen

What was his plan B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4fougb/main_spoilers_tywin_legacy_what_was_his_plan_b/,whatisantilogic,1461177743,"In preparation for season 6, I (like most of you) have been binge watching the previous seasons. I was watching Tyrions trial and wondered why Tywin even went through with the trial instead of simply coaching Tyrion to fall to his knees and beg for mercy. Why did he allow Shae to testify? (Knowing that Tyrion had an emotional connection to her)

Tywins entire history displays a calloused and calculated nature. He has been plotting on getting his family onto the iron throne since he was young. He is always talking about Lannister this and that and Family above all. So why then, after making a deal with Jamie (A deal that would keep his name alive) would he risk his legacy and family name by allowing Tyrion the opportunity to nullify the Jamie deal?

Tywin is supposed to be so smart, but this seemed like a monumentally stupid plan that hinged on Tyrion (A person that has proven to be clever and cunning) not doing what he always does. Tyrion even had doubts because of what happened to Ned when he confessed, so its not like Jamies quick proposal was a guarantee (Tywin had to know that it would sound suspicious to Tyrion). 

My main questions are- Is Tywin not as smart as he presents himself to be or is he so petty that he wanted his cake and eat it too by humiliating Tyrion, even at the cost of his legacy? and When Tyrion asked for a trial by combat, did he not care that if Tyrion died his deal with Jamie would too?

I have a theory on the death of a character in season 6 and more broadly on the trials that are going to take place in King's Landing.

I think we're gonna have a fight between Loras Tyrell and Robert Strong in a trial by combat and that Loras will bite the dust, let me explain. 

We know that Loras, Margaery and Cersei are all three going to be judged by the faith's militant and although i'm pretty sure Marg' is gonna be pardoned at the beginning of the season I'm also convinced that Loras is pretty much screwed. 
The charges against him are really heavy and I only see one outcome for him if he wants to live : a trial by combat. 
As for Cersei, I don't really see her getting away so easily and a trial by combat is possibly the best option for her knowing that she's proctected by Ser Robert Strong.

Now I want to speculate on how the showrunners are gonna deal with these trials. I have the feeling that they will simplify the story to have only one trial between the two accused, meaning that Loras will have to fight for his life against Cersei's champion. It makes sense to me that the show would take that direction because it would add so much more drama and tension to have this fight rather than a Loras trial on one side and a Cersei trial on another. The viewers don't really care about the character of Loras and his trial would take too much screentime.

Let's think about this for a minute. The High Sparrow doesn't have anyone strong enough to defeat UnGregor and he knows it. Lancel would have his ass handed to him in minutes. Now what he could do is break down the two trials into one and have Loras fight UnGregor. Loras is probably the best fighter currently in the capital and he's also a cocky young guy who won't turn down that challenge. The High Sparrow has nothing to lose in letting these two fight each other. He could force Margaery to convince her brother to fight Cersei's champion, the Tyrells wouldn't miss the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by saving Loras and getting rid of Cersei. This would also allow them to forge an alliance with the High Sparrow.

As for the outcome of the fight, I'm fairly confident that Loras will die. First of all because he has nothing more to bring to the show but also because it would be the perfect ending to his story. Remember that Loras fought Gregor in season 1 and having these two fight again would be great to see on screen. Also, we know that most deaths in this universe have been ""ironic' in a sense and Loras losing against UnGregor would be perfect in that regard. It has been said a few time - although it might comes from the books - that Loras is better with a spear than with a sword. Having him lose against UnGregor with a sword when he won the first time with a spear would be quite the ironic death don't you think ? 

Now if you're not convinced, I have a few more points :

- Finn Jones who plays Loras has been cast in Marvel's Iron Fist meaning his schedule might be a bit too tight for GoT
- Having a Martell and a Tyrell lose against the same guy would be a nice parallel knowing the rivalry between the two houses.
- Cersei and Loras were betrothed in the show, having them fight each other would be interesting to see.


So what do you guys think ? 
It's my first post so please be nice.

&gt;Catelyn: Poor girl.

&gt;Roose: Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you enjoyed your first you grace.

&gt;Catelyn: O Ned forbid it, he said it wouldn't be right if he broke a mans jaw on our wedding night.

&gt;Roose: Small laugh.

Almost every marriage is consumed in ASOIAF in the wedding night, except for a few (as far as I know): the one between Renly Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell because Renly didn't want to; this marriage between Ned and Catelyn and the marriage between Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark. The last two because of the same reason. Both involve a Stark, and this shows how Tyrion, in the eyes of his family nothing but a dishonorable dwarf, is the only one in the Seven Kingdoms as honorable as Ned Stark, arguably the most honorable.

Another clear contrast is the wedding between, again, Sansa Stark and Ramsey Bolton, where she gets raped. Nice to see how D&amp;D puts this much attention to details like this.",7,7,False,self,,,,,

So the widely speculated theory of Jon's lineage, as most have come to believe, R+L=J is quite the reasonable one especially with a Tower of Joy scene coming soon. So if this theory holds true then Jon has Targaryen blood in him, also known as blood of the dragon. So as we've seen with Danny then fire isn't really something that bothers them (dragon egg scene). So my theory is that they will try to burn Jon's body so that he doesn't become a white walker (a white walker Jon, holy balls that'd kinda be sweet, but I digress), however the flames will only cause him to rise from them like a phoenix. Feel free to pick this apart, but how badass would it be to see Jon come walking out of the flames born again.

Behold-- [Thrones Pong](http://i.imgur.com/6i3msCM.jpg?1), or GoT Drinking Game as we have grown to call it.



A few years ago in college, a group of friends and I came up with this game and subsequently played it most nights before going out and almost every Sunday night in spring before watching. The game is essentially 21 cup beer pong (or beirut, or whatever you want to call it) where each side plays as a House from GoT, and each House has it's own set of rules as shown above (yes I know they're not all technically Houses). We assigned Houses using a random number generator to avoid anyone complaining about unfair advantages, but I suppose you could just pick them if you like. I believe it started sometime during Season 3 so the rules are a little dated, but we've continued to enjoy them through this year. Below I lay out the basic rules, clarifications on the above image, known issues, and possible additions. It's a long post I know, but I hope you enjoy it and maybe even end up playing the game yourselves. We are constantly adding rules, so feel free to throw out any suggested additions or adaptations as you see fit!

**Basic Rules**

* 3+ players to a side; even teams
* Each player pairs with a member of the opposing team and drinks the shots sunk by that opponent
* 1+ beer per player on each side; ideally, # of beers &gt;= (# of players + 1) unless your bloodline is weak
* Rack is standard 21 cup triangle (6-5-4-3-2-1) unless specified otherwise
* Teams get balls back only if every team member makes their shot in the same turn (unless specified otherwise)
* No reracks (unless specified otherwise)
* After three consecutive sunk shots, a player is ""on fire"" and can shoot until they miss. 
* No reward for retrieving your ball (e.g. behind the back shot, off-hand shot)
* Eye-to-eye shot determines first team to shoot
* You may propose rule changes to begin in the next game but no whining about the rules while you're playing (this should really be a basic rule of life)

**Rule Clarifications**

All rules are written from that House's perspective. ""Opp."" refers to the opposing team, as many Houses have rules that only directly affect the teams playing against them.

* Mad King (Targareyen)- These three rounds have to be taken in a row (they usually end up being the first 3 rounds)
* Khaleesi (Targareyen)- This player is chosen before the game begins, and is the only one who can shoot at the last cup. Khaleesi only has 2 shots per turn when shooting at that last cup, and is a regular player prior to that point.
* Infiltrator (Night's Watch)- The Night's Watch team is able to remove one of the cups they are shooting on immediately in exchange for taking one of their players out of the game. This player can only return once another Night's Watch player (chosen by the opposing team) sinks a cup.

**Known Issues**

* The Rains of Castamere- From our experience, if any team were to be considered overpowered it would be the Lannister's. That is not to say that they always win, but playing as them typically feels like a bonus. To me, this is less of an issue with the rules and more a testament to their accuracy, but haters gonna hate. We tried to even it out by having them drink more, and by switching the Jaime rule from shooting with your left hand to shooting with your off-hand (much to my dismay as a leftie).

* The Imp- Also related to the Lannister's, THERE'S NO TYRION! This has been heartbreaking for us all, but we couldn't figure a good way to include him without adding further weight to the Lannister section of the game.

* BWB vs. Greyjoys/Dothraki- This is actually a serious issue with the rules, and one we have not come up with a solution for. If these teams are paired against each other, the ""No Banners"" rule and ""Iron Price"" or ""Nomads"" rules effectively cancel each other out. We like all of these teams and their rules too much to alter them, so for now if those pairings come up we typically just reroll for both sides.

**Possible Additions**

Whenever we play nowadays we're always talking about teams we'd like to add, but haven't really been able to flesh out full rule sets for them. Possible additions include the Tyrell's, Bolton's, Bravosi (including banking, water-dancing, and/or Faceless Men themed rules), Wildlings, Sparrows, and anyone else you could think of. Partially-completed rules include:

**The Martell's:**

* Viper's Venom- The team gets to add a shot of liquor to any single cup in the opponents rack to be drunk when sunk.
* Viper's Wrath- At any point during the game, one player can call ""venom cup"". If they sink it in the venom cup, then it is pulled and drunk along with a cup for every other member of the opposing team (each of whom also adds a shot to their cup)
* Fucking and Fighting- For every cup the opponents make, someone on the Martell's team must also remove one article of clothing. 21 cups = 21 articles across the whole team (not per player)

And lastly, **the Misfits**- for all the characters too good to leave out but too independent to fit into a team. For this team, each player would pick (or be assigned) a character, and each character has their own rules. These are very half-baked, so please provide your feedback-- there could also be team-wide rules if you guys think of something fun!

* Hodor- Must always shoot with someone on his/her back, but catches fire after only 2 shots (only 1 if playing against BWB). Also, can only say ""Hodor"" under penalty of drinking.
* Varys- Is permanent ""Question Master"" (as seen in other drinking games), meaning if anyone responds to a question that he asks, they must drink. Also... something something no balls something something... 
* Brienne of Tarth- Every other turn she must pledge herself to a teammate, allowing him to take both of their shots and requiring her to drink both of their beers. However, when she is shooting, her shots are worth 2 cups. She cannot pledge to the same teammate twice until she has done everyone once.
* Littlefinger- maybe can elect to switch teams at some point, or something to do with being Master of Coin? I'm not quite sure but he is too good to miss.

So that's it! I hope you enjoyed reading about the game as much as we've enjoyed creating it, and I hope some of you end up playing it yourselves. Thanks for reading, and please fire away with any questions, comments, criticisms or additions!",1,7,False,self,,,,,

It's actually quite a sad story. He starts out so determined, confident, and rightfully so, he is technically the rightful king. By the end of S5, however, he is still as determined and confident... but at great, GREAT cost. I feel as though he is portrayed as gradually losing his soul, or his mind, to madness. Instead of being angry at him for burning Shireen and leading his wife, men, and house into oblivion, I am sad. I am saddened because it is a story of a man convinced of his rights and claims, yet betrays his own honour to achieve these rights and claims.

Close to the end of the Hardhome battle sequence, we see Tormund, Jon, and his men running fast for the pier and the boat. The camera shot then transitions into a view of the Night's King watching them from the top of the cliff as they run. 

A mere 92 seconds later, just moments after Jon and the lads have made it safely onto the boat, the Night's King slowly walks out onto the pier down at the shoreline.  o_O

Earlier on, the wights had to throw themselves over the edge of that same cliff in order to get to the bottom. So my question is this: how did the Night's King get down from atop that cliff so quickly, and then on over to the shoreline/pier in such a short amount of time? 

With only 92 seconds to get from one spot to the other, I'm going to speculate that the Night's King must have either somehow (magically?) jumped to the bottom of the cliff and then ran very quickly over to the shoreline, OR, he possessed the power to somehow (magically?) transport himself all the way there. 

Considering that the Night's King wasn't out of breath, and that he only moved slowly and deliberately - never fast or in a hurry, I'm leaning toward the magic teleportation theory myself (yeah, its a little tin-foil hat crazy, but still kinda fun to contemplate). Either way, its certainly eerie and extraordinary how he appeared so suddenly at the pier. Anyone have any thoughts on this?",109,43,False,self,,,,,

By my reckoning there are about 70 named characters in the show currently  and as were all well aware, being a named character involves a certain risk of mortality. So I want you to answer the following question:

**Which characters aren't going to make it to the next season?**

Pick as many characters as you like. They've got to be named characters - so Quaithe is OK, Bolton Soldier #2 is not OK.

Youll **win one point** for each character you pick that pegs out before the end of the season. Youll **lose one point** for each character you pick thats still alive at the end of the season.

After the last episode, the person with the most points wins the following incredible prize: the right to use the title **King (or Queen) in the North** until the next season starts  this is an officially recognised title that you can use on court documents, credit cards, etc.",18,5,False,self,,,,,

Why and what does it mean?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4fvk3p/everything_some_gods_or_religions_in_gotasoiaf/,[deleted],1461278509,"I'm looking at this question from a broader perspective and mostly through the lens of the show. And to clarify 'power', I mean the supernatural - beyond the apparent power of the human characters of the books. The 'power' that the High Sparrow and High Septon show is interesting in its own right, but not what I'm interested in discussing.

Some obvious examples of religions/gods that seem to be able to show real 'power' are the Lord of Light (Melisandre's shadow demon, Thoros resurrecting Beric), the Old Gods (the existence of the Children of the Forest, Weirwood network/greensight) and the Many-Faced God (the Faceless Mens ability to change faces is seemingly supernatural - likely debatable). 

On the other hand, I see little evidence for 'power' in the faith of the Drowned God and the Faith of the Seven (I don't see Catelyn's experience making prayer wheels and the survival of Jon and Bran as 'supernatural', but could be debatable).

I'm curious if people have other ideas/perspectives on this. Am I missing examples of supernatural powers associated with different religions in ASOIAF? I know there have been other analysis/comparisons done of the religions of ASOIAF/GOT, but none of them seem to address the question as to why some of these religions show such impressive supernatural 'power' and others are comparatively dull.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

The bad: 
Their relgious views are on the extreme side (they oppose people who identify as homosexual and those who are involved in prostitution).

Their methods of punishment are too harsh in some cases (ie gelding and beatings). 

The good:
The High Sparrow want to diminish the power the high borns have over the low born. If you are low born what hope in the world do you have that those in power will value your life? I think that the High Sparrow understands the plight of the common man and is on his side. (by putting Cersei, Loras and Margery on trial they are showing the kingdom that even the most powerful nobles must answer to the same code as everyone else when it comes to matters of faith).

The High Sparrow hates hypocrisy in the church and in the royal court (he removes the old high septor becuase of his use of prostitutes and arrests Cersei because she has commited real crimes. Their titles are not a valid excuse in his eyes).

I think that the High Sparrow is humble to the core and not greedy. I dont think his coup was a way for him to get power for its own sake or a greedy ambition. Its obvious from the way he dresses and his hands-on approach to helping those in need that he doesnt have a thirst for power like others in the show have. He wants the Faith Militant to have power so that the common man can benefit.

The High Sparrow is smart. He is no ones puppet. He sees through Cersei`s manipulation and in fact uses her jealousy to further the power of the Faith Militant for the benefit of the common man.

This is my aruguement for the High Sparrow. Does anyone else share my point of view or disagree entirelty?",24,1,False,self,,,,,

Tyrion is a cynic, a doubter. Throughout most of the season and indeed the show, he's been cynical about the nature of power, and he travels to find Danerys when he hears of her armies and her dragons. Even when he meets her, he doesn't quite believe. But in that single moment, Peter Dinklage conveys so much using so little: Tyrion *believes* now. It's awesome and the most inspiring moment of S5 for me.

I saw a user in another thread mention that Rhaegar may have knowingly had a child with Lyanna to mix Fire(Targs) &amp; Ice(First Men), hoping it would spawn the person who would save the Realm from Winter and bring balance to Westeros.
  
The big story of ASOIAF revolves around the balance, or imbalance, of Fire and Ice in the world in which it takes place. Could Rhaegar have known this and tried to create balance through a child with Lyanna? It makes sense that this would be his motivation to do so, since everything we've heard about him paints him as an honorable man, a man who wouldn't cheat on his wife out of lust. 
  
And did he know of the Night's King's plot to invade Westeros and attempt to swing the balance into the Ice's favor? If so, how would he have known about what was happening beyond the Wall? Possibly through Aemon?",153,284,False,self,,,,,

In the BR commentary of season 5 Bryan Cogman said, there was a reference to Ned Stark in every episode.

http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays

&gt; 70: According to Bryan Cogman, theres a reference to Ned Stark at least once in every episode since he died.

I thought it would be fun to try and catch them all during my re-watch before season 6, and see if Cogman is right. Usually Ned gets mentioned directly by name or ""my father"", ""my husband"", etc. But it can also be his sword, Ice, or the doll he gave Sansa. He also appears in Bran's visions twice. It can be anything that points to Ned Stark.

The problem is, now that I'm done with my re-watch, there are 4 (and a half) episodes where I couldn't spot a reference. Those episodes are:

* S03E06 The Climb
* S04E09 The Watchers on the Wall
* S05E08 Hardhome
* S05E09 The Dance of Dragons

And in S05E01 The Wars to Come, the only one I could find is Melisandre escorting Jon Snow to Stannis on top of the Wall, where she introduces him with: ""Your Grace, the bastard of Winterfell."" That's a bit loose, but I let it slide.

I don't know if people are interested in this at all, but I'd appreciate any help. Once I have a complete list, I could put everything into an imgur album and share it.",9,23,False,self,,,,,

Let us not forget is was Ser Alliser Thorne who has been giving Jon Snow sh*t ever since he got there, and the one who most definitely plotted the mutiny at Castle Black resulting in the murder of Jon Snow. 

I've always hated Ser Alliser Thorne tbh, he's always been a slimey c*nt, and I've always wanted to see a 1v1 against him and Jon Snow.

A very underrated hated character, he is often forgotten because he wasn't in seasons two and three. He most definitely goes down in my top three along side the likes of King Jeoffrey, and Walder Frey. I use to hate the Lannister twins but Jaime has changed a lot and for some reason I began to feel bad for Cersei towards the end of the season and want to see her retaliate.  ",18,8,False,self,,,,,

With Jon I'm not sure how long it's been since his death, but considering the state of his body and the potential fight between Davos and Alliser, it can't be long after his death. Also, from the trailer, it seems they'll actually be showing his body still laying where he died so  guessing it picks up from there. 

In the season 5 finale, Jaime was just leaving dorne and this was shown some time after the scene with Theon and Sansa. I don't know how long it takes to sail from dorne to kingslanding but it would be longer than just a day or 2. Therefore, it wouldn't make sense that the other characters storylines would be going on simultaneously with Jaime's return to kings landing.

And the imagery of when Tywin threw the Wolf skin into the fire with the ""I've destroyed two big houses in my life"" smile 




Ramin Djawadi has honestly done such a great job with the music in Game of Thrones, that scene in Season 4 was such a good blend of music in his part

My brother thinks he is just as power hungry as everyone else and is only using the ""man of the people' ploy to get people on his side. I, on the other hand, have defended the High Sparrow, noting that we first meet him while he is literally feeding the poor. In one scene between he and Lady Olenna, he is scrubbing the floors of the sept and refused her bribes of money and power. His comment that ""You are the few and we are the many"" was one that stuck with me. I think what he means by that is that he isn't going to allow the great houses of Westeros to dictate how to common people are to live their lives. I do not agree with his decision to arrest Loras for being gay or for arresting Marjery for simply lying about it, but I think he does this to prove the point that, if it were lowborn people in Marj and Loras' position, they would have been executed or sent to the dungeons to live out there days. I wanted to see what everyone's opinion of the High Sparrow are? For now, keep it show only, because there are some differences in the books storyline with him. I.E. he let Marjery free in the books as she awaits trial and Loras is never even arrested. So, lets hear it, what do you think of the High Sparrow?",20,7,False,self,,,,,

Within 24 hours there have been two drafts at work, and more to come this weekend:

- Plus 1 point for a character ending an episode alive or animate
- Minus 2 points for ending an episode dead
- Plus 5 points for killing a character on someone else's team
- Minus 3 points if a character from another team kills one of your characters
- Minus 5 points if one of your characters kills another character of yours
- If a character ends an episode as a White Walker they are considered alive
- If a character wargs into another character and makes a kill as them, the character that did the warging gets the points
- As they have never appeared in an episode yet, Euron and Lady Stoneheart (or anyone else who has not appeared) will begin getting points if/when they show up in an episode
- If character A orders character B to kill someone, character B would get the kill points.

Draft is snake style - 10th pick gets 11th pick
You get 1 minute for picks
If you cannot make your pick, it will be auto-drafted by current ranking

White Walker scoring:
Scenario 1:
The Night's King kills Davos.
Davos remains dead through the end of the episode.
Night's King team gets five points for killing a named character.
Davos' team loses five points (minus three for getting killed by a named character, and minus two for ending an episode dead)
Moving forward, they get -2 per episode as Davos remains dead and not functioning

Scenario 2:
The Night's King kills Davos.
Davos is reanimated by the end of the same episode.
Night's King team gets five points for killing a named character.
Davos' team loses two points (minus three for getting killed by a named character, but plus one for ending the show alive/functioning).
Moving forward, they get +1 per episode as Davos remains functioning
If afterwards, Davos gets named kills or truly dies, points will be awarded or taken away as such.

------------------------------

Here are the rankings we used if there was any auto-picks. You can of course add, take away, or adjust any way you want.
If you start your own league, or can think of any good ones, this is also a great place for Team Name ideas. Mine with Jamie as my #1 pick is Burn Them All. We also have Sgt. Pepper &amp; the Stoney Heart Club Band, Shamenun dot com, and 3 Eyes - Full Hearts - Can't Lose. A draft took just a half hour....Enjoy!!

Q: Well, its just a theory [Sean returning to the show in flashbacks]
A:But it's a good theory! And that should happen, shouldn't it? I've definitely got some unfinished business that needs to be resolved there. I'm obviously not Jon Snow's dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don't you? So Bran would kind of be the one having the flashback, and he would see Ned praying, right? And revealing those things? You never know what those guys are going to do with that. It's got to be something special. But I'm into that. I certainly would be into that. Print that! Give them a nudge.

Predict the resolution to cliffhangers from last season. Anticipate the next turn in your favorite character's story arc. Imagine new characters that might be introduced. In general, what do you think is going to happen this season?  You can also talk about what you think will happen specifically in the season premiere.

Just as we have done for previous years, \/r/gameofthrones will be hosting various discussion threads throughout the week for every episode.

If you have been with us for previous seasons, you are probably familiar with the schedule already, but a few important changes have been made for this year, specifically regarding the scopes of the threads (what spoilers can and cannot be posted without tags).

If this is your first time joining \/r/gameofthrones for a live season, WELCOME!  It's going to be a fun season and you picked a great time to start.  A breakdown of the official threads we host and the weekly schedule is below.

---

# Predictions Discussion -- Friday 9PM EDT

The Predictions Discussion is a thread where you can post about what you think will happen next in the story.  Usually these threads are focused mainly on the next episode, but since this is the first thread of the year we'd like to hear about what you think will happen both in S6E1 and all of S6!  These threads have always been popular in the past, but we expect that they will be even more fun this season due to the lack of book material to base them on.

# Live Premiere Discussion -- Sunday 9PM EDT

The Live Premiere Discussion is posted at the start of every new episode and is for your immediate real-time reactions to what you are seeing on screen.  An important change to note from last year is that these threads are now scoped specifically for the episode that is currently airing.  **This means that spoilers for the next episode from the trailer that follows the program must be covered with spoiler tags.**

# Post-Premiere Discussion -- Sunday 10PM EDT

Last year we created a separate thread for Post-Premiere Discussion which is for more detailed, less reactionary commentary.  Just like the Live Premiere threads, the scopes for these threads are now limited to the episode that has just aired.  **This means that spoilers for the next episode from the trailer that follows the program must be covered with spoiler tags.**

Because we have *nearly* run out of book material, we have decided to discontinue the Book vs. Show Discussion threads that were formerly posted on Wednesday nights.  Instead, this thread will be stickied from Sunday 9PM to Friday 9PM EDT every week and any comparisons you would like to make between the show and the books can be posted here.

# Post-Episode Survey

## Link -- Sunday 10:15PM EDT

This year we'd like to have our finger more directly on the pulse of \/r/gameofthrones, so we are introducing a new Post-Episode Survey to gather information about general public opinion regarding the episode.  These surveys have to be created during and immediately following the episode, so **look for a link to the Post-Episode survey to be posted in a sticky comment at the top of the Post-Premiere Discussion thread shortly after the episode ends.**

Participation in these surveys is, obviously, voluntary and anonymous.  We will be utilizing Google Forms to create the surveys ([see an example here](http://goo.gl/forms/oA1TCSyQxP)) and none of your private or identifying information will be recorded or seen by us.

## Results -- Thusday 9PM EDT

The results for each survey will be posted in a sticky thread every Thursday around 9PM EDT and will stay up until Sunday 9PM EDT.  We will have graphical and textual depictions of the data and encourage discussion regarding \/r/gameofthrones' public opinion in the comments.  We hope this new series is something that everyone on the sub participates in and enjoys!

---

Please keep in mind that even though the threads are stickied for only a limited time every week, they are all archived on the [Discussion Thread Wiki](/r/gameofthrones/w/episode_discussion) and you can find the links for this season's and past seasons' threads there.

Season 6 is here, folks!  The long wait is over and we're extremely excited to be sharing our Game of Thrones experience with such a fine fandom.  Hope you enjoy all the official discussion threads this year!

Okay I know this has already been talked about and I'm only really making this post as proof to my friends that I knew it all along when its finally (hopefully) confirmed. If you wanna offer your insight as well that's definitely welcome. Here's all the reasons why I believe him to be alive, in no particular order. 

1. He's alive in the books, confirmed by G.R.R.M. 
2. They didn't ever show him actually dying. This is atypical for the show ESPECIALLY for major characters. See exhibit A: Get Hype. They also never gave Stephen Dillane a proper send off in the inside the episode. This character who's been around since season 2 is killed and it's barely talked about. No interviews, nothing.
3. ""Go on, do your duty"". Think about what lead up to that moment. Brienne missing her cue to finally help Sansa. All of her time spent trying to hold her vow to Cat. And the look she gives Stannis right before she swings. It's reluctance. It's regret. 
4. On that note, think about what we know about LSH and Brienne in the books. This could tie in directly to where Brienne's plot is inevitably heading...
5. He would make a badass lord commander of the night's watch, to redeem himself for his crimes of killing his daughter etc. Jon and him would essentially switch roles. 

Rebuttals:

1. ""But the director said that he is dead!"" His words were actually something along the lines of ""the intention of that shot was always to show that Stannis is dead."" That doesn't mean shit? Not to mention that they are willing to openly lie about these things. They probably knew that everyone would figure out about Jon but this shocker most people won't suspect. 

2. ""He wasn't spotted on set!"" It is entirely possible that they just leave him out this season. It's smart really and will make for quite a twist, and would explain his media silence even more. 

I am a firm believer. I'm shocked at the amount of people that are willing to just accept that he's dead given all we know and are able to conclude. Nothing about it adds up. ",16,0,False,self,,,,,

Yes, I understand that most of you are sick of the hype train, and honestly so am I. I'm tired of getting excited just to get let down. But this season in particular there are mounds of legitimate evidence for her appearance pulled from casting calls, leaks, and rumors. I'm not saying she will show up, but you can't ignore that amount of clues that point directly to her. Now before you make comments like ""let it go"" or ""give it a rest,"" take a look at all the clues to how story is setting her up for this season. I'm not trying to start the hype again, I'm simply piecing together all the evidence. And there's a lot more to it than just a silly episode title that may refer to her.

*Casting call for a band of outlaws who use religion to get what they want. This sounds a lot like a corrupted BWB under the leadership of LSH. The possibility of the BWB appearing this season is further supported by the next piece of evidence.
 *As many of you already know, Paul Kaye who plays Thoros of Myr has been confirmed by his agent to return this season. 
*Another casting call that sounds identical to Merrett Frey from the books appears this season. As you know, he ends up at the end of a noose by the hands of LSH in the books. His filming dates also coincide with the characters in the outlaw band, indicating it could be his hanging. 
*Speaking of Freys... Walter appears in the second trailer and it seems that his wedding will be in the season. This seems like the perfect opportunity for a Red Wedding 2.0 at the hands of LSH and the BWB. 
*The Riverlands is now back into the mix and Jaime and Brienne both will be there. This is perhaps one of the bigger clues because they are now where they were in the books. LSH is the only thing that can progress (and potentially) end Brienne's stagnate storyline, as well as Jaime's. 
*The head special effects guy from GoT stated in an interview that there was a specific scene set to appear in season 4, then it got removed and put in season 5, but was removed again. Now he says it's in season 6. Season 4 and 5 already had their fair share of dragons and white walkers, so what other scene would involve special effects? A CGI LSH would be a perfect candidate. 
*Lastly, this may be a fake rumor but twitter account IrishThrones went right out and tweeted that their close sources confirm LSH commands an army in season 6. Now whether or not this ""army"" refers to the BWB, I am not sure. That isn't necessarily an army so take that with a grain of salt. Maybe she actually commands the Tullys? Who knows.

One last thing... I know a lot of people are expecting Sansa to take on the role of LSH, but I really think that is the dumbest thing. Why in the world would she leave the north and go to the Riverlands to kill a bunch of Freys and Boltons? Her place is in the North reunited with Jon. She would be out of place if that were to happen. Besides, the flawless storytelling and the emotional impact of having Catelyn interact with Jaime and Brienne again would be lost. I just don't see this happening to be honest. 

With that said, what are your thoughts on the subject? Do you think this is enough evidence for her to show up or am I grasping at straws here? 

EDIT: Sorry for poor organization! I tried to make bullet points but I'm new to this :/",9,12,False,self,,,,,

""But ---__-_--__----_-_--, that's ridiculous!"", you might say. It's not.

&amp;nbsp;

First, to set the scene for my theory, I want you to [watch this.](https://youtu.be/LyUxrJtnsuY?t=31s) She said he's WHITE WALKING. Look at Kimmel's reaction, he's shitting himself! He knows too! She worked with Peter Dinklage or something (I have no idea), so he must have told her! 

&amp;nbsp;

So after you've watched that, I want you to have a look at some pictures. First and second are the lustrous Kit Harington and the third is Kit Harington dressed up as a White Walker. 

https://i.imgur.com/1SxPe7Y.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/JUarvmV.jpg (forgot to resize this, sorry!)

https://i.imgur.com/LeOKyiz.jpg

Can't you see the similarities? If you can't, **look again.** 

... Still can't? Fine. [Look at this.](https://i.imgur.com/JlNHMjs.jpg)

Still can't!? Are you **blind**? 

Ok fine, [I made this to help you](https://i.imgur.com/8fikCo6.jpg). 

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, mucking around aside, he does look quite different. The cheeks are different, the mouth is different, one has hair and the other doesn't, one has ice horns, they both get my blood pumping (because they're both Kit Harington), the list goes on. But remember, if it is Kit, he's got about 12km of makeup and latex between his face and the air around him. It's easy for them to add bigger cheek bones (which could make him look bulkier and more intimidating, mind you) and ice horns and pointy ears and all the rest of it. If it was Kit, the main giveaway for me is the ears, especially the lower half of the ear. They're exactly the same! D&amp;D have been pretty ballsy, putting him in the trailer and all. He was right under our noses the whole time!

.
If you don't know Azor Ahai, then do a little googling, it could be a fun plot twist coming up.
.
the hints we are given include the stars bleeding after a long summer, and a hero born amidst smoke and salt, and he will wake dragons from stone. Melisandre also says she asks for glimpses from Rhllor, and sees only snow. AA also uses a fiery sword called Lightbringer to banish the darkness.
.
While someone has written an AA theory about pretty much every character in the series, (my favourite is the hound. He goes from being afraid of fire to wielding it. That would be a good story). I have not yet come across one suspecting Eddard Stark, and it surprises me.
.
The most popular theory, and undeniably a well-fitting one, is that Azor Ahai is reborn in Jon Snow. The line about Melisandre seeing only snow would make a lot of sense if this was the case, however I believe Ned Stark is also a very good candidate, and as a big fan of his, I hope to see the character as well as Sean Bean return in some form.
.
The first problem with this theory is; as Sean Bean pointed out, he had his head chopped off in the first series. However there are conspiracies that state a possibility that Ned stark was switched before the execution, and still lives on. I wont take that angle, but it is possible.
.
I find the bones of Ned Stark to be an interesting part of the story that has some mystery about it. There doesnt seem to be any evidence of where his bones currently lay. They did appear to have made it to Moat Cailin, but not much further. Moat Cailin has also since been overrun by Iron-born, and then recaptured by the Boltens. What if the bones had been taken by the Iron-born, or what if they have found themselves in the hands of the brotherhood without banners back in Riverrun. 
.
The brotherhood without banners was indirectly created by Ned, and they are great believers in the lord of light. Thoros of Myr, a member of the brotherhood, has resurrected Beric Dondarian from the dead several times, and so it would not be impossible for him to try some fun magic with Neds bones.
.
If nobility is a requirement of being AA reincarnated, then it is not clear. Even so, I dont believe he had any relation to the Targaryens. If nobility is important, why not the starks. The kings in the north are more ancient and mysterious than the Targaryens. There is the woods witch prophecy that azor ahai would come from the Targaryen linage, but there isn't concrete proof that this prophecy is real or reliable.
 .
So when it comes to the prophecy, I think the most concrete evidence so far for anyone, is the red comet. When watching the TV series, this had a lot of attention drawn to it and it seemed to be of great importance, with nothing much resulting from it (yet). This gave strong evidence that Daenerys is AA because of her rebirth from fire with the dragons, but it would not surprise me if this was all misdirection. 
.
So continuing on with my theory, the other significant event to take place before the red comet, was the death of Eddard Stark, this could have been a sneaky disguise to fulfil the prophecy without being noticed. As far as I can tell, the rebirth of AA did not specifically have to take place at the same time as the bleeding stars. 
.
The rebirth amidst smoke and salt. Well this could be to do with Neds bones potentially being in possession of the Ironborn, not necessarily on the salty shores of pyke, but perhaps Deepwood  Motte. The resurrection of Ned, could come after some siege or battle event resulting in the smoke, or Ned taking shape in the smoke.
 .
Similarly if the bones are in the possession of the brotherhood without banners, and Catelyn Stark could seek revenge on Walder Frey. It did seem rather specific to be talking about Walder Frey sharing salt with Robb and Catelyn. So perhaps some scenario plays out with that mixture.

.
Once reborn, there is also the lightbringer part of the legend. As we know, it would seem Valyrian steel seems to be able to kill white walkers (or maybe thats just Jons Longclaw sword). Neds sword Ice has been melted down to create two swords. There is also an ancient sword from the stark family that was the original Ice before it was replaced with a valyrian steel version, and this sword could play more significance. But to go back with the valyrian steel sword, if Widows-Wail was to be obtained from Tommon and Oathkeeper from Brianne, and they were reforged into a new sword, this could become the flaming sword Lightbringer (a song of Ice and fire). 
.
The legend of Azor Ahai also details the forging of the sword, where it was first tempered with water (either actual water, or perhaps by driving it through the hearth of a Greyjoy relation). It was tempered secondly by driving the sword into the heart of a lion (Ned would have no argument with killing a Lannister). Finally the sword was tempered by driving the sword into the heart of his love. In the books Catelyn Stark is alive, and is known as lady Stoneheart traveling with the brotherhood without banners.
.
By doing so, Catelyns cries (or her widows wail) might wake dragons from stone. I would like if waking dragons meant waking Ice dragons in the north, not only for the appeal of having Ice and Fire dragons in a song of Ice and Fire, but It would be a new interesting creature to see on the show.
.
What do you reckon??

After reading the books I became far more critical of the show, but have made peace with pretty much every change at this point, enjoying it more.

S6 will decide everything. We will either get impressive original storytelling, or a disappointing, wasteful excuse for a season. They have so much good potential, and if it's squandered I will be so bloody sad. The Walking Dead already broke my heart a month ago, and I've sworn off it after a season of total shit. Game of Thrones has been my favourite show for so long, and one of my biggest passions. I don't know what I will do if S6 is bad, considering there is so much stuff that they could get right if they just tried. Besides getting angry as hell, of course. The writing was really sloppy in places last season, so much so that hundreds of fans have crafted possible and improved versions of shit people were paid to get right. Don't cater to idiot viewers. Don't lose focus of your own continuity. Don't Flanderise characters. Don't forget everything but shock value.

Yet I worry the writers are only capable of these things, rather than making something good.

As you all are aware of, tomorrow is the big day, the return of the TV show. Since I have always loved the Reddit community, I decided to share the drinking game that I've been playing with my friends in the couple previous seasons.
It started from a mashup from a few others I found online, and makes the experience of watching the new episodes a lot of fun, haha.
You can use any beverage to play: Beer, vodka blended with a combinations of fruits, flavored rum with soda or ice cream, etc. The amount you drink on each dose can also vary (the important thing is to have fun, not necessaraly getting completely wasted).


So, here are the rules:


* Someone says ""Winter is coming""
* Someone says ""valar morghulis""
* Somene mentions the Mad King
* Someone swears by the old gods and the new 
* A White Walker appears
* Dragon breathes fire
* ""A Lannister always pays his debts""
* Daenerys speaks in another language
* Daenerys has her titles declaimed
* Tyrion drinks or makes someone laugh
* Melisandre flirts with someone
* ""The night is dark and full of terrors""
* Margaery tries to manipulate Tommy
* Hodor
* Someone calls Jon Snow a Bastard (x2)
* ""You know knothing Jon Snow"" (x3)
* Jon Snow returns (x5)
* Rickon/Benjen Stark returns (x3)
* A Joke is made about Jaime's hand
* Cersei smiles
* Bran worgs
* ""I'm Reek"" (outdated I guess)
* Ramsey hurts someone
* Sansa's revenge (x3)
* Arya gets whacked (x2)
* Arya street selling something
* Arya mentions her list
* Nameless character dies
* Someone finds out about Jorah's disease
* Jorah tries to get out of the friendzone (x3)
* Gay sex scene
* Brienne sex scene (x5)
* Someone says ""Milorde"", ""Milady"" or ""Your Grace"" (x1/2)

If you find yourselves drinking too much, you can always limit any specific rule to count only once per scene!

If you guys have any funny new rule, let me know! Sorry for eventual misspells, regards from Brazil.

Tyrion, Jaime, Cersei and Lancel all have golden hair. You must know that this show has established a lot of importance to color of hair. It seems that the golden hair of the Lannisters represents the usual pride and arrogance of the Lannisters. Throughout the show whenever the characters change, their hair color will change as well. 

- After Tyrion has talked to Jon Snow and travelled the wall, his hair has taken a darker tone. 
- After Jaime gets captured and learns humility from Cat and Brienne, his long golden hair has changed to short dark hair.
- After Lancel turns to faith, and regrets his sins his long golden hair is gone, and he is left with short dark hair.
- After Cersei learns from her mistakes and takes the walk of shame, her long golden hair is switched for short darker hair.

I don't know if Tyrions hair change was on purpose or if they just decided to change the hair color for aesthetic reasons, but the others seem to be on purpose. It seems that every time a Lannister learns humility and maybe feels regret his hair will change accordingly. Joffrey was a cunt his whole life and his hair remained golden throughout the show. Same holds through with Tywin. On the other hand so were Tommens and Myrcellas and they don't seem like cunts so I don't know for sure.",7,4,False,self,,,,,

[source](http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays)

It could be argued that Ned Stark was the protagonist of season 1. But he was also such an important character, that you will hear his name everywhere, frequently, even as late as season 5. Well... not quite in *every* episode, like Cogman claims, I think. During my re-watch before the new season, I paid close attention and took some notes. But even with a little help of this sub, there are still 2 episodes left that don't have a reference: S04E09 and S05E09. It's possible that I just missed them despite multiple viewings. It's possible that some scenes got moved to different episodes (in fact, that's what I believe happened in S04E09/10). But it's also possible that Cogman just exaggerated a bit. Whatever the case may be, it's still remarkable how good old Neddard keeps popping up constantly, in one way or another. Like his ghost looms over the entire story.

I don't know how many of you are interested in this. But since I've taken screenshots of every instance I've encountered, I thought I might as well share them here. I've also included the relevant dialogue.

As you can see, season 2 has quite a lot of them. No surprise, since everyone is still dealing with the immediate fallout of his death. It gets more interesting to see where he pops up in later seasons. Also, keep an eye out for Ned in season 6!",51,155,False,self,,,,,

Hi there, fellow Game of Thrones fans! 

I am one of the developers of [**gotdeathpool.com**](https://gotdeathpool.com). We created this web application after seeing all sorts of death prediction submissions on this subreddit. To quickly summarize what you can do on this website; 
Predict who dies on which episode and acquire points. Compete with your fellow house predictors/members to get to the top in your shared house (there is also a global highscore page: [**Top predictors**](https://gotdeathpool.com/top-predictors)).

At the moment of submitting this text post, 63 characters are possible candidates for your Death Pool. We will update the character database the day after an episode has been aired.

On the [**how to play**](https://gotdeathpool.com/how-to-play) page you can see the instructions and FAQ.

The production of this website started quite late, so please forgive us for submitting this website this late and any bugs you may encounter. By saying this, we are also working hard on upgrading the website with new functions. Our goal is to have the website fully responsive to let users access every page also on mobile/tablet. At the moment, not every page has been optimized.

We highly appreciate feedback/suggestions (positive and negative), or characters that are missing on our [**feedback**](https://gotdeathpool.com/feedback) page. 

Have fun predicting!",5,0,False,self,,,,,

She doesn't have black hair (""the seed is strong""). All of other Stannis' children were stillbirths and deformed. It seems like Selyse is carrying guilt for not bearing him a son, but maybe she's actually guilt ridden she laid with someone else in order to give him an heir? 

Moreso, Selyse doesn't try to stop Shireen's execution until Stannis states that Shireen has Kings Blood, a statement that Selyse seems to visibly react to. Ultimately, the sacrifice proves ineffective.

They are fantastic! I have watched all of the HBO shows. They are also really good. But with the deviation from the books in the past seasons and the lack of the next book, is anyone going to wait until the next book comes out before watching season 6?

I admit, I watched season 1 before reading any of the books. But I found that reading the books allowed me to get so much more out of the story than the show ever did. Also, knowing the backstory of the characters from the book helps me understand a lot of stuff in the show that non-book readers do not.

I feel that watching season 6 will spoil the next book (if it ever comes out) since it is likely to deviate from GRRM's story.

-------------

Note: *I posted this [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3lqtfa/all_spoilerstheory_the_red_god_doesnt_exist/), and figured it was time for an update with the new season starting tonight.  There are a few more sections, addressing additional feats, and a handful of other changes.*
------------

Often when discussion turns towards the R'hllor, Melisandre, and the worship of the Red God I have noticed many operate under the presumption that R'hllor does indeed exist, the Red Religion is basically correct, and Melisandre is communing with ""him"" in some manner.  Below I will refute this point by point, addressing everything seemingly caused by religious action or divine intervention as nothing more than trickery, confusion, and magic of fire and shadow.  These events primarily arise due to the action of Melisandre herself or that of the Brotherhood Without Banners operating under the religious instruction of Thoros of Myr.  In doing so I will be pulling from the books, but will address differences between them and the show.

--------------

**1) Melisandre's Feats**

1a) *Mel's Shadow Assassin*: this is magic, plain as simple.  In both books and show Mel coats the process and production of the shadow creature in her religion, but that's mere trickery (something she's well versed in, and I'll cover further down).  This is not the action of a Fire Priestess, but that of a Shadowbinder from Asshai.  This manner of magic is mentioned several times throughout the books and show, and Melisandre openly admits and is understood to be one:

&gt;The woman was the heart of it. Not the Lady Selyse, the other one. The red woman, the servants had named her, afraid to speak her name. ""I will speak her name,"" Cressen told his stone hellhound. ""Melisandre. Her."" Melisandre of Asshai, sorceress, shadowbinder, and priestess to R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire..."" ~Cressen, Maester of Dragonstone

Only Melisandre herself claims that the production of the shadow creature was related to Rh'llor and her religion, no one else ever does, despite meeting numerous other figures from the Red Religion and even another shadowbinder (Quaithe).  Furthermore, we know that in Asshai magic is practiced more openly, and that the severe downturn in magical ability experienced throughout the world for the last few centuries effected those in Asshai the least:

&gt;It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn't there be dragons too? ~Dany talking to her handmaidens.

Furthermore, during her dedicated chapter Melisandre even appears to admit to herself that the Shadow Creatures are creations of *sorcery!*

&gt;My spells should suffice. She was stronger at the Wall, stronger even than in Asshai. Her every word and gesture was more potent, and she could do things that she had never done before. Such shadows as I bring forth here will be terrible, and no creature of the dark will stand before them. With such sorceries at her command, she should soon have no more need of the feeble tricks of alchemists and pyromancers. ~Melisandre, reflecting on her position at Castle Black

-------------

2a) *Mel's Visions of the Future*: several times throughout both book and show Melisandre claims to see the future, albeit often in confusing or distorted manners.  And here I do agree, she is indeed seeing something-- but she is just one of many to be granted such power, and there are no indications that R'hllor is actually inducing them.  In the show both Maggy the Frog (as seen in the Season 5 flashback) and the sorcerers of the House of the Undying exhibit similar abilities, presumably because of their magical and thus not divine origination.  Furthermore, in the books the Ghost of High Heart also demonstrates the ability, with her visions in particular sounding exactly like Mel's:

&gt;Snowflakes swirled from a dark sky and ashes rose to meet them, the grey and the white whirling around each other as flaming arrows arced above a wooden wall and dead things shambled silent through the cold, beneath a great grey cliff where fires burned inside a hundred caves. Then the wind rose and the white mist came sweeping in, impossibly cold, and one by one the fires went out. Afterward only the skulls remained. ~Melisandre's vision in the fire

&gt;The old gods stir and will not let me sleep. I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye. I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings. I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, oh, I woke from terror. All this I dreamt, and more. ~The Ghost of High Heart's vision

Both are full of symbolism, both are ultimately true.  Neither is from a god.

--------------

3a) *Mel's Burning of the Leeches*: clearly coincidence.  To suggest that in a war between five rival kings all of them would survive would be ridiculous, and at least in the show her assertions regarding their impending deaths is proven wrong, as Balon Greyjoy outlives Stannis Baratheon.  Nothing occurs to suggest a divine hand is acting against Robb, Stannis, or Renly.

--------------

4a) *Mel's Breaking of the Winter Storm*: thus far this event has only occurred within the show, so there is limited textual information on it.  Again, however, this appears to be nothing more than coincidence-- or at best Melisandre operating with an understanding of weather beyond that of her contemporaries.  This knowledge could have been obtained during her still murky past.  Unfortunately there wasn't a Maester on hand, given Melisandre's dislike of them, so we cannot know if a secular individual could have predicted the same outcome.

The same can also be said for when Mel claims to have produced good winds for the sailing to and from of Essos.

--------------

5a) *Mel's Ability to Manipulate Fire*: several times throughout the books and show, Melisandre is shown to be capable of manipulating fire in some limited degree-- either by inducing visions for others, or just making it do odd things (smoke heavily, change color).  The source of this ability was not revealed until a chapter was dedicated to her, and we learn:

&gt;While the boy was gone, Melisandre washed herself and changed her robes. Her sleeves were full of hidden pockets, and she checked them carefully as she did every morning to make certain all her powders were in place. Powders to turn fire green or blue or silver, powders to make a flame roar and hiss and leap up higher than a man is tall, powders to make smoke. A smoke for truth, a smoke for lust, a smoke for fear, and the thick black smoke that could kill a man outright. The red priestess armed herself with a pinch of each of them. ~Melisandre, going over her stock of supplies

We must conclude that she is simply well versed in alchemy, and how best to produce reactions that appear to be of divine origination.

6a) *Mel's Ability to Light an Eagle Aflame from a Distance*: just prior to Stannis' arrival during the battle for the Wall, a skinchanger's eagle keeping tabs on everything bursts into flame by Mel's hand.  This one is quite simple, as if we presume Mel has fire-magic, then the casting of a fireball or a projected explosion would be extremely simple.

7a) *Mel's Resistance to Poison:* when first introduced, Melisandre survives an assassination attempt by Maester Cressen, who offers her wine laced with poison.  To seal the deal Cressen drinks the wine with her, but in the end only he dies, while Mel is unaffected.  Mel of course claims divine protection, but the way it is described in the books provides another possibility.

&gt;""He does have power here, my lord,"" the woman said. ""And fire cleanses."" At her throat, the ruby shimmered redly.

Most obviously, she could have been using magic to purify whatever she drank, anticipating poison.  That she is from Asshai, near where the Strangler (the poison used) is sourced from, would mean she is probably aware of it's properties as well.  When tied into her knowledge of powders and alchemy, this appears even more true.

There is an even more mundane answer that is possible, however, if we look at the events just prior to the poison attempt.  Beforehand Stannis is acting quite mean to Cressen, then the Maester oversleeps and almost misses the feast entirely, and then Stannis uncharacteristically comes over to speak to him when Cressen actually arrives.  If Mel saw the assassination attempt in her flames, she would of course have told Stannis.  Now Cressen was a loyal man, and Stannis is not liable to arrest people on premonition alone, so he tried other means of preventing the attempt.  This is why, in the books, Stannis is extremely mean to Cressen just prior to the attempt (very out of character for Stannis otherwise), to keep him away from the feast.  Then Stannis instructed the guards to not wake him, as they were supposed to, so Cressen would miss the feast and his chance to poison Mel.  And then finally, upon seeing him enter, Stannis went over and tried to shame Cressen out of the act.  Obviously, as evens played out, none of that worked and here Melisandre's visions were relatively spot on.

--------------

**2)Thoros' Feats**

2a) *Thoros Raises Beric from the Dead*: this is clearly the most poignant of the supposed feats performed by followers of the Red God.  The show gives a pretty good overview of events when this occurs, but the book goes a bit further with a longer description-- and its there we find the truth.  This is not an act of religion, through which R'hllor acts-- but that of *fire magic*, misunderstood overtime and converted into religion.  Let's look at Thoros' own telling of it:

&gt;""I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time, his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I knew there was no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave him the good god's own kiss to send him on his way. I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him, down his throat to lungs and heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord's servants as they died. I had given it a time or two myself, as all priests must. But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come open. It was not me who raised him, my lady. It was the Lord. R'hllor is not done with him yet. Life is warmth, and warmth is fire, and fire is God's and God's alone."" ~Thoros, speaking to Arya

They speak prayers, take fire into their mouths in some manner, and then breath it into the fallen.  If we conclude this is not divine action, then we must conclude that it is *magic*.  Fire magic, more directly, misinterpreted as a religion.  This would in fact establish the Red Religion as the branch of magic associated with fire, just as there are branches associated with ice (the White Walkers) and water:

&gt;At Volon Therys, Garin found himself facing a hundred thousand foes, a hundred war elephants, and three dragonlords. Here too he prevailed, though at great cost. Thousands burned, but thousands more sheltered in the shallows of the river, whilst their wizards raised enormous waterspouts against the foe's dragons. ~From the History of the Rhoynar's war with Valyria

But why is this ability showing up now, and not in the thousands of presumed ""last kisses"" provided each day across Essos?  Part of it I cannot be sure, there is something Thoros and Beric are doing that's almost unique.  But as to their ability to only do it now, that is because of Dany's dragons, their return having induced a sudden ability boost for pyromancers and workers of fire magic across the world:

&gt;""Half a year gone, that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass. He had some small skill with powders and wildfire, sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work. He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air, but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets.""  

&gt;Dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood. Even the smoke was gone now, and the crowd was breaking up, each man going about his business. In a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty. ""And now?""  

&gt;""And now his powers grow, Khaleesi. And you are the cause of it."" ~Dany and her Handmaidens

To further prove this, we must draw the obvious conclusion: if magic is at the root of both the White Walker's ice powers and the Red Religion's fire powers, would not the raising of the dead inflict a comparatively terrible toll upon the risen, such as the soullessness of the Wights?  Of course, and that is why if you wait to long even fire magic has its limits:

&gt;""She is,"" said Thoros of Myr. ""The Freys slashed her throat from ear to ear. When we found her by the river she was three days dead. Harwin begged me to give her the kiss of life, but it had been too long. I would not do it, so Lord Beric put his lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from him to her. And . . . she rose. May the Lord of Light protect us. She rose.""

And finally, in the show, Beric gives us a direct testament of what lies beyond the pale of death.  He has been there, after all, and says it most simply:

&gt;The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady.

You can get to it from the links in this post or by clicking the ""[Edit Your Flair](http://reddit.kevinhatch.com/)"" button in the sidebar.

It's a completely new version and quite a bit faster.  The UI has been simplified as part of the optimizations and to better support mobile users.  The bot runs once a minute to apply flair requests.  Please wait a minute for your flair to show before submitting another change request.  A few more tweaks and features will be released over the next few days as the app is tested with live traffic.

With this release there are 125 new flair options, which now makes 400 total to choose from.  236 of those have alternate ""words"" options as well (House Words, character quotes, etc.).  Just click on the text you want to see an example of the flair, and then you can submit that to the bot to apply it to your Reddit account.  

The live stats have been removed from the default load for speed, but they will be added back as an optional page view in the coming days.  Optional sorting by popularity will also likely be in the next patch.  If you find any problems with the new app, please [PM me with details about the bug](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kjhatch&amp;subject=GOT%20Flair).  

**EDIT: With all the additional requests another pack has been uploaded with another 42 options to pick from.**

Cersei, the psychotic queen who will go through extreme lengths to kill a perceived threat, is okay with having the last known living Stark (bar Sansa) having his own (effective) army?

And then I thought, maybe she isn't. Maybe she just doesn't have the resources in the Night's Watch to make it happen. Not satisfied with this answer, I did some googling and found [this thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/76128-cersei-is-the-one-who-killed-jon-snow/) which is mainly based on the books, which I haven't read. There's a whole storyline that specifically addresses this, though involving characters and plots that don't happen in the show. Okay, so in the show universe, who else could Cersei have influence over in the Night's Watch?

Alliser Thorne. The (presumably) main culprit of the assassination of Jon Snow. So I checked his wiki page to see if there was any evidence to support this and sure enough, from the end of Season 1 to Season 4 he has been sent to King's Landing to warn Joffrey about the White Walkers. I don't remember if this ever played out on-screen, though there is no mention in the wiki, we can assume if this meeting did happen Cersei would be closeby.

Now what exactly were the terms of their deal? Well, in the books, Cersei sends a man to the Wall with the implication that if he kills Jon Snow, he'll be let out of the Night's Watch. Alliser Thorne, for those who don't know, was head of a noble house but was disgraced due to their allegience to the Targeryens during the rebellion. A sentence probably administered by King Robert himself, and if anyone could restore House Thorne, it's Cersei. Bear in mind this is a similar tactic to the one employed by Jaime to kill Robb Stark (offering the position of Great House to Roose)

I don't know, maybe there are holes in this theory I'm not aware of as I haven't rewatched the series in a while. What are you guys thoughts?

I think the show producers intentionally got it out of the way in the first episode so that most viewers can slowly forget how terribly it was executed in the show.

At the end, the directors talked about why they did it, stating simply that GRRM said she was a few centuries old, and her reflecting upon her true self and the current predicament shes in.  They equated the scene to paralleling her lies (apperance) and the lord of lights lies (R'hllor and Azor Ahai).  They simply said it was the right time to show her as an old person, and didnt really give any hints as to why.

The reason i ask is, She made no attempt on resurrecting Jon Snow, no hints, nothing.  However, part of me was hoping she would have an awakening, but i guess instead they showed her and made me think it was a failure.

In other words, that scene confirmed Jon Snow is not coming back.

EDIT- Clearing confusion.  Im stating that the scenes complete lack of consideration for Jon Snow's Resurrection to me seemed like it was a nod that he wouldn't be coming back",102,0,False,self,,,,,

I don't know but I will point out the following:

[Melisandre speaks about her use of potions, S4 E7.](https://vimeo.com/95851842) 23 seconds in:

""No no no, not that one, you wouldn't even want to touch it.""

Fast forward to S6, E1, it appears to be the same clear cylindrical potion bottle sitting half empty in the shot just as she is taking off her necklace.

[Speaking of Melisandre's necklace, it glows when she is doing magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1hd43t/).  If you watch, it glows just before she takes off the necklace, and there is an ominous flash of the potion bottle above framed in the shot.  Given e.g. the Purple Wedding camera angles I think there is some significance to all of this.

[This excellent comment] (https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2a7go9/spoliers_acok_regarding_melisandres_ruby_necklace/cisasro) points out that the only time we see Melisandre without her necklace is when Selyse visits her in the above scene (and sees her for what she truly is).  This highlights the relationship more, seemingly tying the scenes together.  

I would say it appears she did some magic before climbing into bed.  

Whether it was taking a potion of unknown origin or otherwise having the Lord of Light act, there was something going on in that scene.

My best thinking is that she sacrificed herself to save Jon Snow (only death can pay for life...).  She wanted to look upon her true self one last time.  She wanted to die comfortably in bed.  That potion of scary potency she warned Selyse against could very well be something to kill her.

Edit: [some comments here on why she doesn't sleep much](https://www.quora.com/Is-Melisandre-even-human) making it odd for her to go to bed.  Also reinforces the theory she is doing some kind of resurrection spell on herself and she is going to stop resurrecting herself and transfer that to Jon.",394,864,False,self,,,,,

I bet that Stannis was killed by Brienne in the season 5 finale. My friend disagrees. Our bet requires a body to be shown, if not the body is voided. I know he's still alive in the books, but I think that character will be taken over by Davos/ Sansa. The director of the episode has stated that they didn't show Stannis's death because it was unnecessary. To me Stannis has nothing left for the plot. There's also multiple evidence in the season 6 premiere of his death. Game of Thrones also releases a ""beautiful death"" artwork for each episode, and they chose Stannis's death for the artwork over Jon Snow (b/c everyone knows he's coming back). I just see no reason or purpose would he serve by still being alive. What do y'all think of this?

Edit: The only thing that I'm not too sure about is the third episode for season 6 is called Oathbreaker, contrary to Brienne's sword: Oathkeeper. So maybe she broke her oath of killing him? Not sure. I'd say odds are that she killed him

In order for Jon to be reborn as Azor Ahai, a certain sacrifice has to be made.

To me, that last scene of Mel turning into the old woman, showed that she is possibly losing her faith. The magic was there, but wearing off. Even *she* cannot keep up appearances anymore after the death of Stannis and what appears to be confusion in what she saw in the flames. Maybe Jon's death is the last straw for her. He's the only one she saw left with any sort of power. And he's gone, too.

I don't get all the hate on the turn the Dorne plot took. Yes, it could've been handled better by showing the dissatisfaction of the dornish people with their prince, but I'm willing to let that slide for being an amazing show. 
1) apparently the people stood behind the sand snakes, but they didn't kill the prince before cause they were hoping he would go along with them, and now they have no choice but to kill him since they disobeyed him. So obviously within the time they killed Myrcella and he got the news they made sure they got enough people to rally behind them, and to always be by his side so they can kill him the moment he finds out.
2) no Jamie couldn't just turn around, he was already far from Dorne, the poison only works when the victim gets over-excited, like Bronn in the cell. They probably had their father-daughter moment when they were already far from Dorne, so it was better just to send a message to Dorne and just continue sailing to King's Landing to plan his next move. 
3) the other two sand snakes followed on another boat, why is that hard to believe? I mean... there's dragons, and hot priestess turning into an old hag, but it's so hard to believe that they could've taken a boat and just sailed there- or even sailed in a different route and met them there. Also the sand snakes attack on the prince probably happened right after Myrcella's death. 

I'm probably going to get down voted because so many people right now are loving to hate the Dornish plot line due to the bad acting the sand snakes displayed last season- but luckily I never cared about karma points. 
Again sorry got any misspelling and grammatical errors. ",102,102,False,self,,,,,

1. **The Sand Snakes on the boat with Trystane**- It is perfectly reasonable to believe that after Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane left on their ship, Obara and Nym left on a separate ship to follow them. Once Jaime went to shore with Myrcella's body it is very reasonable to believe they were able to sneak on the ship.

2. **Jorah finding the ring**- If they were out in an open field and just happened to randomly find a ring, I could see how that might be a ""plot hole"", but that isn't what happened. Jorah noticed a very obvious piece of the field that was trampled on by horses with a small piece of untouched ground in the center. So it is reasonable to think that someone who is looking for clues would look down in the center and actually see the ring.

3. **Melisandre still appearing young in the bath scene while not wearing the necklace** - The necklace isn't the only thing that can hide her youth. In the same bath scene she reveals to Selyse that she has several potions that are for deceiving people's eyes. Therefore, it is implied that there were potions that also keep her youthful. During the scene where she takes off the necklace, the camera spends several seconds focused in on the potions, I doubt that was just for cinematic effect.

4. **Brienne's Fighting** - Brienne and Podrick face off against 6 Bolton soldiers (4 on horseback and 2 with dogs), Brienne kills 4, Pod and Theon each kill one. We've already scene that Brienne is an impressive fighter. She held her own and was even winning while facing the greatest swordsman in Westoros, even if he was exhausted and out of practice. She killed two on Renly's other Rainbow Guard. She killed 3 Stark soldiers. Her being able to fight off 4 Bolton soldiers doesn't seem like it would be such a difficult task. As for Podrick's new ability with a sword, Brienne said last season that she was going to start training him.

5. **The Hounds** - Yes, the hounds disappeared after Brienne arrives. It is most likely that they ran off. Although they were Ramsay's best dogs that are able to tear a human to pieces, the only scene where we've seen that happen was with an unarmed and injured girl that was running away. Who knows how they would have reacted in a real fight.",1103,2482,False,self,,,,,

I love all of the storylines in the show (except for sand snake BS) but it's like I can't pay attention to the rest of it without knowing matter-of-factly Jon's fate.

The problem with that is, if they decide he really is finished, I don't know if I can ever accept it. Not in a ""I'm grieving for a lost character"" kind of way, but I'll be expecting him to appear for the rest of the show. Even if we see him buried and never talked about again, I'll be expecting a scene every Sunday of a cheesy zombie Jon hand popping out of the ground.

I'm hoping I get over it and can enjoy the other three billion plot lines again, but as of right now I feel unsure.

My one saving grace was the ""but I saw him in the fire."" To me, that means he'll be back. Because as wrong as Melisandre was about Stannis, we all know there's more to the Lord of Light than just blind faith.

I'm hoping we get a scene with Jon making an amazing comeback and killing the traitor watchman during a wildling sure on castle black... But hell, I'd be happy settling for a white walker Snow. Or even a direwolf Snow.

I'm obsessed with Jon Snow, and you made me this way HBO.

I'm still holding on for zombie Sean Bean. I made a huge mistake falling in love with this universe.

I don't know his proper motivation, but it might be revealed later on. I had a feeling when I was watching the episode tonight for three reasons:

1) Varys corrects Tyrion's offer to give money to the woman. This could be written off as nothing, but it could hint at Varys looking to get on the good side of the people in the city. It's not fishy, but the scene could show something more than a bit of characterization or humor. 

2) Varys and Tyrion are walking down the street unguarded. This happened shortly after Dany was nearly killed. Varys must know they are not in harms way. I don't remember exactly but either Tyrion or Varys mentions that the Sons of the Harpy have a leader that is coordinating the attacks. From the beginning of season 5, Varys has been pretty damn shady. Unless a new character is introduced WHO ELSE IS CAPABLE OF LEADING THESE GUYS?  This leads me to believe that Varys has been coordinating the Sons of the Harpy to create unrest, which might advance his mysterious motives in some way.

3) Varys always talks about his birds (messenger Ravens or informants we don't really know), but Sons of the *HARPY* (bird/human mix, Varys could be called a birdman since he deals with birds a lot). This one is the most convoluted but weirder shit has happened (I'm looking at you old mel). 

IDK I'm just obsessed with theories. Tell me why this is wrong.

And thus, she has now lost fate in R'hllor, just look at how defeated she looks at the end. She doesn't know her place anymore but her magic will still be effective. 

Thoros of Myr doesn't have any fate in R'hllor but the resurrection works and so he still uses fire/eastern magic.

This is perhaps not as obvious to show watchers as book watchers due to the lack of a pov chapter from Melisandre.

(I tried to find and cite that comment, however I could not find it.) In the game of thrones universe there are 7 new gods:

The Father: represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead.

The Mother: represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. 
She is sometimes referred to as ""the strength of women"".

The Maiden: represents purity, innocence, love, and beauty.

The Crone: represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern.

The Warrior: represents strength and courage in battle.

The Smith: represents creation and craftsmanship.

The Stranger: The Stranger represents death and the unknown. 

(The above descriptions taken from [GOT Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven))

I was just curious if you think that certain characters are representations of those gods. I know previously there was a theory of the Starks representing the seven gods, but that has changed with the story. 

After Season 6, Episode 1, it seems that Melisandre is the Crone. Obviously, she has the physical characteristics of the Crone but also the symbolism of the lantern. The lantern represents lighting the darkness, just like the red god. 

Davos or Jon have the characteristics of the father in being morally centered and representing justice. Araya or Baelish could possibly be the Stranger. 

TLDR: Which characters in the show currently represent the seven gods?

If someone has something different than please address it.

My personal thought: Is that the blood actually looked black. I can't recall any reference to black blood anywhere else on the show, and I have not read the books. So maybe the black blood symbolizes something, I don't know what, but has to mean something.

Other theories I have seen: 1.) There was not enough blood, as if either he stopped bleeding or he was gaining blood back. 2.) The blood/snow was BURNT. Most likely referencing the thought that Jon will be part of the Lord of Light's plan. 3.) That there was a picture in the blood, most have said a Stag. I don't know exactly what that would mean except that he was Baratheon and his blood moves to show it or something.

Anyway, that's all I have thought/read so far. If anyone has another theory, or wants to explain reasoning's behind these mentioned, please do.

Like I found that scene so awkward just because ***DAT IS ONE BIG FUCKING DUDE*** and after one tiny little dagger stabs him, he is down for the count. The frail dude in the wheelchair puts up more of a struggle than he did.

Like look, I get it. The writers can write the situation however they want to kill him off. She could've slashed his throat, she could've poisoned the blade, she could've stabbed at just the right spot where his neck meets his spine to sever that spinal chord.

...but the scene doesn't really showcase any of this. It feels lazy. It's ""A DAGGER! I AM IMMEDIATELY DEAD! THIS IS ME DYING"" as he falls flat on his face without a hint of a struggle. Meanwhile, Mr. Wheelchair that was just showcasing his limp for us is stabbed in the heart of all things and he can manage to struggle and fight for a bit.

I'm not doubting the integrity of the scene or the plausibility of it, cause again they could just change it up a bit to make it believable. However, I ***am*** absolutely amazed that no one working on the show watched that scene and thought ""this seems a bit awkward, don't you think?

He's a character who could die next episode and I wouldn't care. I can remember the first time we saw Khal Drogo he did more in his first scene with no words than this new Khal did with all his words. Just the look in his eyes and the power he exuded was amazing to watch. Jason Mamoa did a awesome job as drogo. But this new guy just seems kinda like a carefree uncle who occasionally sexist at thanksgiving but has some funny jokes. I really felt like the men on this episode were very underwelming besides the nights watch guys. Coincidently the night's watch scenes were among my favorite scenes of tonight. 2nd favorite goes to brienne sansa theon and pod,12,0,False,self,,,,,

My first idea was her male companion since he was forced to be with her and prior to the events was late and said he had to get things ready. But of course he was apparently stabbed. It could not have took his life but we haven't seen him since.

My second idea was Daario since he was behind her but then again he has been in her bed - he could have taken her life a hundred times so far. And with that someone was watching Tyrion and Varys walk but Daario is away.

Jon Snow is dead. [Dead](https://youtu.be/q1Q2SA-6r4I?t=83) as his Mum, Dad, and (hopefully soon) aunt.

My theory, that instead of Jon being resurrected by R'hllor (Which I doubt Mel can do), she places a glamour over Davos to make him appear like Jon. That way, we avoid fantasy tropes (*Looking at you, Gandalf*) but still get to see the return of Jon. It would also fit with what the cast and crew tell us-

In S6E1, Brienne saves Sansa and Theon from Ramsay's men, and then Brienne pledges her allegiance to Sansa while the latter thanks her.

But how sincere was that thanks? Sansa's been learning from Littlefinger, after all. What if later in the season, it's more beneficial to Sansa for her to betray Brienne than stay with her?

1. Dorne, the show runners probably realized it sucked and instead of letting it linger throughout the season they are getting it out of the way and giving a reasonable resolution. They will probably be in the next episode, but hopefully no more.

2. Nothing happened: it is the first episode of a season, *nothing* should happen. Do you really want to see Jon Snow born again 20 minutes (yes), but the show runners can only have some many OMG moments before the show would become cartoony and unreasonable. 

3. In this episode they setup: Sansa, Pod, Theon, and Brienne on the run together (probably cool), they setup Tyrion and Vary's in Meeren (probably cool), they setup Jamie and Cersie for the season (probably cool).

At the moment he says that, we see that [he and Varys are being watched](http://imgur.com/z1LFARI). THIS was THE MOST disturbing scene for me, for some reason. The idea that someone could be pining after my two favorite characters.

And it isn't just that they don't have Martin's lines to fall back on. The writers have been making up their own dialogue for years and it's been fine for the most part (aside from Bad Poosey type bits.) 

But really, everywhere that wasn't the North was seriously lacking the the dialogue department. Obviously the Dorne stuff was horrendous. But damn...Tyrion spoke in nothing but exposition, roughly half of Jorah and Daario's lines felt forced, Jaime's ""fuck prophecy"" speech was stilted, Cersei's was all exposition, and the Dothraki stuff was horrendous.

I'm one of the show's biggest fans, and I still thought it was a decent episode, but jesus. I was amazed at the drop in writing quality. Hoping tonight was a fluke/the result of Podeswa's direction and not a sign of a MAJOR decline this season. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

It would seem to be the case that she was planning to bring back some king or another. Her faith is at it's lowest point, which is a prerequisite for other Lord of Light followers to bring back the dead to life. But still Snow is on the table and now, she has lied down.

It's interesting to note the origin of Melisandre's name is not of fire, but water. Her namesake is [Melusine]( http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/melusina.html) from the French medieval legends of the Melusine. These are fey women who are by turns, part mermaid-serpents, or when they are called one... dragons. In one story, a Melusine is called a ""serpent"" by her husband, who spied on her upon her transformation in her non human form. She then turned into a dragon for a final time before leaving him and the court forever but not before leaving two magic rings. So if Melisandre is the name of a changeling fey water spirit but also the name of a dragon spirit, what does that mean for Westeros?

Let's go back to the main story. I think people are giving the necklace too much significance. Sure, it glows when Melisandre does magic, but I think it only glows because she *is* doing magic. It's not powerful in and of itself, but it does react to her power. Melisandre is far older than she appears to be, but she's most probably not one of the faceless men, because she worships the Lord of Light. So what's the source of her magic and her transformations? 

I'm going to go with the French here and the French myths of the Melusine. I think Melisandre is a changeling and is part dragon herself, one who can simply change herself on will. Her belief in the Lord of Light is incidental, it's just a name for the power she believes in and that which guides her actions. We already know that the Targareyens are said to have lied with dragons in order to gain their distinctive white hair. If they did that, it could be that the way it happened was to lie with dragons is their human form... as the form of they are in Meisandre's case. So if she is really a changeling and is not who and what she appears to be, why is she choosing to be an old woman now, and not a dragon? Why does she worship the Lord of Light and why is she now in the form of an old woman, why isn't she lording herself as a dragon all over the place, brining people to her side because HOLY SHIT MAGIC?!

It could be for three possible reasons. The first reason could be that she is taking her true form to bring John Snow back to life, via her own sacrifice. This would make a lot of sense, since as she said, she saw him in the flames. If this is true, then her death pays for his life. The second reason could be she is planning to transform again as a dragon which may or may not lead to anything for John Snow, and Mel was just waiting for the right time to go about her change. She is where she needs to be now, the North, and needs to kick some ice zombie ass so no more glamors or games, old woman with dead men or not, she is preparing to take her final form no matter what happens to Snow. The third possible reason is: she just laid down to die, knowing that Winter is coming and like it or not, every one she placed faith in (including the Lord of Light) has not got her back after all. 

I don't much like the third reason because it doesn't fit her character arc, and if she is in fact part very old woman, seeing two men die shouldn't really make her lose her faith. Old women lose their faith because it abandons them, and in this case, her faith didn't really abandon her, in fact, the word of the Lord of Light seems to be spreading in Essos. If she was just a dissapointed fraud, she wouldn't have looked so freaking scared to assume her form as an old woman. She'd already have known she was one. And in the books, Melisandre doesn't sleep. If she doesn't sleep, how is she possibly human? If she is a witch, how does she maintain her form yet not have the power to endure two very mortal deaths in the world as it is? Old women, old witches, aren't exactly known for rolling over and giving up. Old women are sneaky and resourceful. Old witches are something else entirely.

And if I'm right and Melisandre dying is just right out it means the Red Woman isn't an old witch at all. She's old fey. If anything can stop the Ice and it's winter, it's that. Because if the King of Winter has half the magic of the dead he commands, that means somewhere there must be an opposing force of life to match him. Dany could be it, but if that's true, than Melisandre wouldn't be so put out. Even if everyone else died after she backed the wrong horse, she'd know that she needed to high tail it to Dany. And she didn't, despite her having a thousand reasons to do just that.

I think the first two possibilities carry a lot more weight. Either she's a fey, or she is a witch working to give some final magic up to the Lord of Light, through her  death leading to John Snow's life. Possibly both. But G.R.R. Martin is no historical slouch, and he gave Melisandre her name for a reason. And she transformed. I think there is a reason for that, and it isn't just to show us that Melisandre was just giving up. It was to show us she was an an old and formidable enemy, capable of magics greater than her glamor. She's capable of mystery, and that's not something that lies down in defeat.

If you want dragons, I suspect Dany isn't the only option. But if you want Snow back more, than I'd say there might be one around willing to take the hit to make it happen. But if there are Ice Dragons too, than you might just want them both to stay dead.",7,4,False,self,,,,,

However, it was a little rushed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gc2vc/everything_i_think_they_ended_the_dorne_storyline/,flipdark95,1461565276,"So, I didn't have that much of a problem with the way the Dorne storyline progressed in Season 5. I liked the swashbuckling duo that Jaime and Bronn were, and I liked the portrayal of Prince Doran and Areo Hotah. I even liked where they took Ellaria's character after Oberyn's death in Season 4, and I even ended up liking the Sand Snakes a little mainly because they were portrayed as hotheaded young women who wanted to avenge their father.

So I liked the storyline. I did, but it was also clear from the way they ended the storyline this episode that the entire dorne storyline was kind of rushed and erratic from the start. 

I think that there really was no other way to progress the storyline any further this season. And while it could have just been resolved with Doran arresting the Sand Snakes and probably executing Ellaria for her crimes, I like that they kept her portrayal as a vengeance obsessed widow consistent and had her end up killing Doran and Areo Hotah as well. In the books, her character instead went the other direction and simply mourned her dead husband and actively refused to feed into the cycle of viciousness between the Lannisters and Martells, so I also like that the show decided to take her in the other direction to see where that would take her. 

It was also clear from the end of last season that Ellaria simply wasn't done with her revenge by a long shot. And now that she's gone as far as to kill Doran, Hotah, and Trystane (him winning or killing one of the Sand Snakes in a enclosed space with no training was never going to end well in his favor) it will be kind of interesting to see what will happen to Dorne as a result. If anything, I personally think this will tie back into a part from the books where a Martell family member (who wasn't in the show because it would just be too difficult juggling the interweave of two extremely disconnected plots on a TV show) traveled to Meereen as part of a plan by Doran to marry Daenarys and prepare for her arrival in Westeros. I think the show may reverse this by having Daenarys land in Dorne and execute Ellaria and the Sand Snakes for their treachery.

As for the rest of the episode, I loved it and thought it was a solid introduction to Season 6 that also capped off a pretty difficult to handle storyline from Season 5 that may have been better of not being adapted at all for the show.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I think/hope the writers are using Dorne as a way to easily link Dany to Westeros, and it will be the point where Dany lands at the end of this season. With Ellaria at the helm now, the Dornish as a nation (assuming that Ellaria wasn't lying when she said she had support from the people) want revenge on the Lannisters. Additionally, Ellaria mentions the need for a strong leader as Doran is dying. I think there is a strong possibility that Dorne could  ally with Daenerys for several reasons:

1. She wants to overthrow the Lannisters.

2. She has the strength of dragons behind her.

3. She is a Targaryen, and Elia was married to Rhaegar.

4. Tyrion knows who Ellaria is due to his  connection with Oberyn, and he may be able to leverage his similar desire for revenge as a way to connect with her and arrange something between Dorne and Dany.

5. There has been a lot of focus on strong females (regardless of acting skills) in Dorne -- Dany would continue that nicely.

I feel as if Varys/Tyrion may get in contact with Ellaria, alert her to Dany, and arrange an agreement for Daenerys to join with the Dornish forces as they overthrow the Lannisters.

Or maybe I am just hoping this as a logical way to resolve the otherwise rather illogical way Dorne has proceeded these past few episodes.

Added a TL;DR version at the bottom.  

My theory is that her jewel absorbs life energy (which she gains from killing with fire and/or from sleeping with men. Basically making her a succubus) used for her magic and life extension both. Her Ruby works as a magical ""life battery"" for the lack of a better word. Evidence is that the ruby glows when she drinks the poison. I think that **the reason the ruby glows when drinking poison** is that the poison was in fact, lethal to her, but instead of killing her it depleted the ruby of the accumulated life energy instead.    
  
Evidence that would strengthen this theory: If anyone can remember if the jewel glowed while Melisandre slept with Stannis or Gendry.  
  
George RR Martin has taken lots of aspects from both history and mythology. IMO it is not a long shot that he took inspiration from the [Succubus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus) when writing Melisandre and took his own twist on it by linking the life energy to a ruby. It would kind of mix the poweres of a succubus with that of a phylactery. A phylactery is an old fantasy concept which most commonly is described: ""An object used by a lich to contain its soul and protect it from death, common in fantasy games"". Rowling stole this concept - and may be more familiar to Harry Potter fans as a Horcrux.   
  
TL;DR: Melisandre's Ruby works as a Phylactery/Horcrux that drains and stores life energy from people killed with fire and/or sleeping with men. And is expended by safeguarding her from death - as when poisoned - by draining the Ruby of power before Melisandre.

We see [this](http://imgur.com/hA7P9G5). The camera keeps focus over it for a solid second which felt really out of place when watching. Then Davos just stares at it for a second before going inside. I take it as a hint that it is not the blood of a Snow. A bit of foreshadowing for the tower flashback. Did anyone else catch that hint? I know its subtle, but nothing on screen is a mistake/not planned. 

More foreshadowing regarding the fate of tyrion and varys:
[This](http://imgur.com/gPrhKTD) is a shot of them walking and talking about Dany's absence and the fear in the city. The camera shot is taken through a what looks like a cell door and right above each of their heads a black spike points down at them suggesting that that they may be imprisoned and their lives will be on the line.

Throwing in some symbolism cause why not. Lots of literal and figurative backstabbing. Theon stabs a Bolton soldier through the back. Sand snake stabs Aero Hotah (the big black bodyguard) in the back and the Dornish prince gets stabbed in the back too. 

Sansa and Theon try hiding under an uprooted tree which could be related to their faith in the old gods who have been forsaken. Sansa accepts Brienne's service and 'swears it by the old gods and the new'. I tried to find something more meaningful about that scene but that's all I got. ",10,6,False,self,,,,,

1.  Jon Snow will revive miraculously and begin leading the Night's Watch again.

2.  Melisandre will disappear mysteriously with the Night's Watch thinking she fled while fans will know she probably sacrificed herself to save Jon.  

3.  Jon Snow will begin commanding the Night's Watch with awe since he'll begin showing signs of being Azor Ahai such as drawing Lightbringer and other crazy miracles.  He'll also show much better political and strategic planning as well as having a constant inhuman calmness about him that demands respect.  

4.  This will cause even some Northern lords to begin bending the knee to Jon and he starts amassing his own huge force to combat the White Walkers.

5.  At this point someone close to Jon, probably Davos or Edd, will make a terrible discovery.  They find Jon's true corpse hidden away somewhere, perhaps beneath Castle Black or in the woods.

6.  It turns out Melisandre has actually been using her glammer the whole time to take on the appearance of Jon Snow and further using her red magic to show signs of being Azor Ahai.  She kills whoever discovers her secret so as not to jeopardize her immense progress with possibly Davos even accepting it since he knows it's the only way to stop the White Walkers.

The hints I think there are for this possibly happening are the focus in this episode on Melisandre's glammer and the way Jon Snow's revival has seemed like a barely kept secret.  This way we both get the glorious revival and then have it taken away from us later in a heat-wrenching plot twist.  

One flaw I do see in this is when would Melisandre hide the body?

Reason: Why put so much emphasis on her, why create an episode called the red Women, why do such a reveal?? She said the she saw Jon Leading the North in the fire, wouldn't that mean she saw his death as well? She did looked surprised I will admit, but she could faking it. Let's consider that fact that she had been hiding her true identity, she must have tons of secrets and knowledge. She could've been preparing for this moment.

A) With the reveal of Melisandre being ancient and using magic and projecting glamors to look young (and to be fair, very bangable) I think they may go down the route of Lady Stoneheart with Jon, not in terms of going on a murderous spree across the land (although that would be good to see) but in terms of Dondarrion giving his life to resurrect her, I reckon Melisandre could do it for Jon.

B) Is his lineage, should the R+L=J theory be true, he may not be burnt by the pyre they will give him as a member of the Nights Watch, and could well be resurrected by it. (Now I know Aemon burned, but so did previous members of the Targaryen's remember).

A few extra theories I have is Drogon could be flying over the sea to the wall, awaking the Targaryen genes within Jon, he could warg into Ghost and go down that route, or he could just be dead. (But in the trailer, there is a man on horse back at around 1:12 that has long black hair and what looks like Longclaw)

What's everyone's thoughts with the Nights Watch/Jon's storyline then? How will they procede from here on out?

Also, what do people think is going to happen with Dorne, I read a very interesting piece earlier, I'll post it here.
*(With Doran dead and none of his other children established as existing in the TV show, House Martell is legally extinct. Ellaria cannot make any claim to rule because she was only Oberyn's paramour, not even his legal wife, and even if she as his wife she has no blood claim to House Martell. Oberyn's eldest daughter is Obara Sand - but by definition, all of the Sand Snakes are bastards and thus cannot lawfully inherit any of House Martell's lands and titles.)*

(Looks pretty cool with Ghost and Jons Snow on the cover) As I arrived at home I opened it and noticed something strange. 

At first I want to clarify that this is stated as an official HBO licensed Product. I dont know the official release date for those Notebooks but I am pretty sure it is released as merchandise for this new season and on the back it is stated as 2016.

So whats so interesting about it? In the inside you can see the Family Tree of House Stark which is or must be up to date. I mean its and official product and merchandise for the new season so yeah. Now the funny thing is, in this tree it is stated which characters are deceased and Jon Snow is not one of them.

I dont know. Maybe its just a mistake or something, or it isnt even up to date. What are your thoughts?

He didn't even say or do anything during the first episode of Season 6, yet there are more comments about how he should die than something a bit more horrific like the Dornish story line. I don't remember people getting this upset whenever Ramsay or Joffrey were being... themselves I guess.

Look, I understand the love we all share for poor old Jonathan Snow. And those who even thought about messing with him would be branded an enemy of the Interwebs. Even I've been rooting for Jon throughout the series despite the fact that he's a bit too honorable for my taste and didn't accept Stannis' offer to join him and potentially rule the North.

But try putting yourselves in Olly's shoes. Imagine if everyone you knew... no wait, your family... no no wait, just a loved one was butchered by a group of people who raided your land for selfish reasons. Can you really find it in your heart to forgive and forget their actions? Maybe I'm the only one with this mindset, but if something like that happened to me, the only thing I would care about from there on was to see those people get the same treatment. Or hopefully even worse. And seeing your friend and mentor (Jon Snow) lay the red carpet for the ones who are directly responsible (Tormund &amp; Co.) is something that would have pushed me over the edge as well.

Olly may be missing the bigger picture or underestimate the threat of the WWs, but I can still easily sympathize with the kid.",11,1,False,self,,,,,

___
[Just an other theory and observation someone posted on the Ice and Fire sub, about Melisandre shiny ruby, which I thought about and felt the need to expend after the recent episode. It adresses the fact that she wears no jewel in the recently infamous bath scene.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2a7go9/spoliers_acok_regarding_melisandres_ruby_necklace/cisasro)

There is two, according two me, theories that are possible. Some implies way more lies and tactics than the other.

First one, which is more simple, and we consider that Melisandre simply never, ever lie :

So if we expand on it, including the new episode, we need to take for granted the fact that Selyse could see Mel for what she really was, an incredibly old woman.The mirror has now a possible new signification. She progressively come to it, slowly, carefully, with a troubled look.Yes, she is doubting, she is facing a crisis over her faith. But there's more. She wanted to check, and she just realised... She does not see her true self.

She never thought that she was a seductive, she knows that others perceived her as one, which don't normally affect her, being a believer.

*But now, she is fooling herself with the charm, and that implies that she is not simply doubting her god, but not even really trusting he exists, and that she is her human representant.*

And now she sees only the lie, not the truth. She lost, in that moment, her true self, her identity. And she can't stand to look not at her, how ever incredibly old and aged she is, but as what she built to skim trough believer and non believer. And she just sees that she is lying, but not for her god if she doesn't have faith. *She is now lying solely for her own vanity, now.*The realisation horrifies her, so she takes off the mask. But still, she considers lying bad, even an horrible sin, as she lived with that certitude for so long. And if she would have kept the charm, it wouldn't be to advance the cause of the truth, but only to advance her motives and interest.

Or... Second, way more complex, but I think more probable, in this universe, and also implies that Melisandre would be way more manipulative then we could ever supposed :

Otherwise, maybe she started to doubt way earlier and still did it, like for the flaming sword, but facing the recent change and fails she had, she now realise what it implies. She didn't worried about her own faith, if she still managed to convert people, has she did with Selyse, and see no arm in getting better standing as some kind of payment. As if she has struck a deal, not as a devot, but as a sales rep. She still knew the word, and the way. She knew the ""recipe"", but what gave her all those false visions or lower ""miracles"" was that there was no passion. Thinking about it now, when did you saw last an invocation of Melisandre where she didn't feel distant, caused by her overconfidence? The only times she does it with some kind of passion is when she seduce someone and lay with them, and she would get the pleasure from satisfying her vanity, and that could be in some kind of way misinterpreted as devotion. Those spells always seems way more effective in some kind of way than the blood spells, but she is always mentioning the king's blood, never the king's sperm. Once, I remember her alluding to it, but that's as much as she said. She is realising now that what she is doing is having more and more impact, and now even costing hundreds of lives, her spells loosing power even with bigger sacrifices each times...

Cause R'Hllor has catch on her.

And he isn't as cooperative as he was before. It's not simply that he speaks in metaphors or symbols, he just... doesn't care. He know he is just being used, so he start punching back : he is simply bullshitting back, more and more, or use lesser willingness each time, but still not cutting her access straight off. That's why she was finding each reading cryptic as the seasons went by. He wanted her to realise by herself that what she was doing was simply wrong, that it wasn't the way, and that it had impacts on her powers.

It wasn't about how much new believers you could bring into the church, it was about your own faith. When he answered Thoros, I bet you he didn't convert anyone in a long time. But he heard his honesty, and he answered it, and made the miracle. I don't know if he was still acting as a priest except in title while in the brotherhood, even after the events, but his reach over the number of persons he could *in details* talk about ""our savior R'Hllor"" was propably very low, and still, he kept bringing Beric back to life again and again, which is a very rare occurence it would seems. R'Hllor wasn't giving over how much ""clients"" he got, but how much of the faith and the honesty were true. Thoros himself was, in the end, the main person he ever converted, and that may plays a role about the stupefaction of Mel. She was wondering how exactly strong his faith was. She expected to see a drunkard and a fighter, but she met a man more pious that she ever was, and more humble that she will ever be.

But what helped Thoros was his doubts, not about his God, but his own faith. Fearing each time that he may start taking R'Hllor for granted, saying the words every time with more heart and trust to prove he wasn't falling, and to prove that he honestly thought that Donbarrion was someone WORTH to be saved, again and again. And maybe he didn't ever understood that there was not a single time R'Hllor could object, as he was so honestly confident in Beric worth and is affection for him. R'Hllor trusted him, for his honesty.

Now, I would like to consider some symbols.

The light isn't the fire, it's the truth. She know it, but she thinks it's probably just a metaphor or something, and that's simply that. She got it the wrong way : the light IS the symbol. ""I've seen the light"" isn't used when you mean that you have literally seen a source of light, it means you have found a great truth.

So that make lying the darkness, in which the fears live.

And facing her recent failures, she understand she is simply a fraud, and a pathetic one at that. She isn't even a doubter anymore, she is straight up using influent peoples' faith (or need for miracles, as Stannis does) to advance herself. She is lying to everyone. She barely have any influence on the elements and the future, even in the North and its supposedly magically charged aura. She realise her weakness. And crippled by fears, crippled by shame, she is overcome with this sadness and this weight on her shoulder. R'Hllor isn't to blame for it, he wasn't at fault for his cryptic messages, SHE was for not asking to see, but demanding thing, specific at that,

She is the ultimate liar. She is the darkness herself.

Her obsession with fire is wrong. Fire isn't the light. Fire destroy, and after it there is the black sooth. Every time a man burn, the smoke is heavy and dark. Remember the Riverlands, after the raids, devoid of life, empty... And black. Traces of the fires everywhere. Harrenhall is a very dark and intimidating place, still in part due to its destruction by fire by the Targaryens, thought now to be an haunted place... The very first sacrifice, at Dragonstone, is held at night, and is a frightful event.

Cause the night is full of darkness and terror.

Fire isn't bad in itself, but outside of her visions, she always use it in a ruthless manner. Destructive, even sadistic. Even with the leeches, she hangs them for a while over the heat, pinched hard in a very disgustful manner, as the worthless worms they are. On that point, even the Bolton can be seen as more careful to a living being than at least someone else.

And, last episode, as she start to consider herself worthless, she looked in her mirror. She doesn't see herself, she see the charm. And she realise that she is even fooling herself. She just liked the charm, it is all vanity. She even believes her own lies.
    
&gt;  So when we think back to the bath scene, she talks to Selyse, and about seeing through lies, which make Selyse see the true women, behind the magic. Take for granted that, as viewer, we are not believers, and that it would make the charm affect us, and since it would make no dramatic sense to expose the truth yet to the viewer, in our universe, the charm is... your own damn screen.
&gt;  
&gt;  She act confidently cause she know she actually the one in charge over who she call ""my queen."" Selyse is a true believer anyway, better use that as your advantage. What Melisandre say in the first part, is entirely true. The ""alchemy lesson"" is also, up until the ""Stannis point"".
&gt; 
&gt; We she say she didn't had to, she wasn't talking about the veil. She meant totally something else.
&gt; 
&gt; She was lying to Selyse about Stannis being a true believer. When she ask if she used the potion, Selyse never EVEN could for the start of it consider Stannis seeing Melisandre as a seductive and beautiful red haired woman. To her, Stannis is her rock, and she probably think for herself that he must believe even more that she does, what's about the prophecy of Azor Aza, the time Stannis and Melisandre pray together for miracles...
&gt; 
&gt; So by saying no, she is repulsed by the thought of this old woman laying with Stannis, but she can not conceive how strong his faith was to go that far, and that she wouldn't be able herself. That it was then a totally selfless act, physical in nature, but SOLELY spiritual in meaning, some kind of prayer coming from over the narrow, some exotic way. And yes, that it couldn't imply any form of pleasure or desire, from EITHER party, which we know isn't in fact true.
&gt; 
&gt; Cause yes, Melisandre was also lying about herself! Sure, Selyse may be a bit worried, and shocked by it, but she surely could never consider that a devoted woman as herself could ever, EVER take ANY form of pleasure from it. She is simply some being composed uniquely of purity to the queen. But she is in fact lying the most to her, the obviously only true believer, and the one with the best ""naive/influence"" ratio. She is basically the one who brought her here.
&gt; 
&gt; And when Melisandre told her about the truth believers see, and point to the flame... she playing ""the emperor's clothe"" game. By being manipulative and confident, and Selyse wanting to show each time the reach of her faith, she... plays along. She stares at the flames and she sees... flames. But never would she say it, in cause Melisandre could ever doubt her.

So when she takes the charm off, it isn't to show the doubting. She know it by now.

The moment shows what she thinks of herself. Worthless, old, ruined, tired. She now think that she isn't even worth the charm. She accept this old crumbling body as what she is actually is, and that she actually earned it. This is the price she has to pay. But at least, she isn't lying to herself anymore. She could not stand in that instant the charm, with herself not even worth the darkness. She is so ashamed of herself she consider now that she reached ""beyond the night"".

And she goes to sleep, weak, frightened, alone, renied. Her that would never feel the cold is rubbing her arms, chilled to the core. She has no more magic to prevent her from that.

More than her old bones, what she feels for the first time is vulnerability.

For the first time in her long life, she felt as if she was in danger. She had her magic, she had her charisma, would Davos had not exist,she would basically had her own troops. Even naked, as she was before Selyse, she has her wits and her ruse, and even this old skin could be wear proudly as a mean to intimidate people, if she plays her cards right, and even then, every other element would have applied.

But not now, by ""botching"" the job, she alienated almost everyone. She managed to kill the entirety of her allies, in a magistral slaughter, killing the man with a claim to the throne she put all her efforts in, trapping herself in a foreign land where her own hosts are whispering between them tales of ""the witch"", and even her own god is fed up with the chaos she created. She painted herself in the corner, and she realise it.

And, even if I think she won't die, I suspect that she has now understood her own mortality. She shivers, and she understand she is faillible, that she can feel pain. And she accept the eventuality of her own future death. As she gets stuffed under the furs, what actually dies is her shame. What will probably happen is a transformation.

A bit like the First and the Second Gandalf, if we think about the appearance. Way more dramatic psychologically.

Her shame dies when she make peace with the person who hurt her the most : herself. She accept what she has done, and she won't deny it, but never would she be able to be that exact person again.

To confess is the first step.

To confess is the first step...

 Bonus TL;DR : Melisandre thought she was paid over sales, boss says ""no, that's hourly"", she get pissed saying she never read that anywhere on the contract, boss shows said contract, said she misread it so well he should still pay a compensation for hear hard work, boss mention ""actually, you don't have any daily target, don't stress yourself, we are a NGO defending human rights..."", Melisandre says she don't care she needs to pay the rent so she will be paid more, boss says that's not actually his problem and that sadly he just decided that it's not gonna work out. Melisandre says she quits then, boss igore her, she bitch about how she hate call center jobs anyway, boss proceed with not listening, she proceeds to calm down and offer excuse, Melisandre's anxiety disorder actually gave her huge mood swings. Boss being magnanimous, offer a second, as long as she reviews the contract first and agree firmly. Melisandre is confused about why the contract is in a call center when she thought she was working front desk at a gym.

Boss just loose hope.
___

So there is also another theory about what I guess could follow for Melisandre ""the White"", what could happened to her faith and devotion, what could be the state of the church of R'Hllor in the present times based on what little clues we got (and extrapolate), and what that tiny thing Davos showed about his respect in Melisandre could give her in the end a nice push. I started it first in my comment, but needed a break. If you liked my analysis, and would interested to read about those things I just mentioned, please mention it. :)",6,2,False,self,,,,,

Where are the dynamics I LOVED watching? These are the hallmarks of good writing combined with good directing and acting.  Scenes like the back and forth between Tyrion and Cersei.  Or Arya and Tywin (when she was the cup bearer).  The way Ygrette lit up the screen with her banter about Snow. I can still hear her voice and those scenes stayed with me.

And nobody else has brought this up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gdfa9/everythingthere_is_only_1_plot_hole_that_needs_an/,jaxmagicman,1461592781,"I saw a bunch of people crying that, this is a plot hole or that is a plot hole.  Not knowing or not seeing something happen isn't a plot hole.

The hounds not being there isn't a plot hole.  It doesn't take any suspended belief that once the dogs were let off leash (or more accurate, not actively under control) they would disappear.  They were blood hounds and not fighting dogs.  Once the fight started they would have run.

Melisandre's necklace isn't a plot hole either.  She doesn't need to to perform her magic.  The only reason she changed when taking it off this time is because she had lost her faith and didn't want to hold on.  Or she could have used it to perform the magic to change.  It doesn't seem to be something she needs.  Just something to help.  There is also the potion.

Jorah and Daario finding the ring isn't some major plot hole either or even good luck.  They were tracking.  We see them finding a burnt ram head.  We see them making their way towards where the dragon has been hunting.  Then we see the place where riders had circled someone or something.  Jorah went to that spot.  The circle with an untouched ground.  He would have easily seen the ring.

The Sand Snakes showing up on the boat isn't a plot hole either.  You may not like them, but it doesn't take any leap of faith to think they had plenty of time to catch up to the boat.  The could have set on the pier for a day and still had time to catch up.  But most likely they spent an hour or two and then got on a boat to leave right behind.  I'm not sure how long the journey from Dorne to Kingslanding takes, but I have to think it takes longer than a couple hours. But then what about the guards, surely the guards would have stopped them.  Not really.  First they know them, so maybe they wouldn't have thought they meant him harm.  Or maybe they were with the other guards who we had already seen stand by and do nothing as Prince Doran was killed.  

No, the only plot hole to me is the fact that Cersei and Robert had a son before Joffrey that the show has now forgot.  She mentions it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OgGxirgnjg&amp;feature=youtu.be) when talking to Catlyn

Most answers for that is that she was lying.  But that isn't true either because she again brings him up when talking to Robert [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY5As-RP1MM&amp;t=5m25s)

But again last night she mentions that the witch said she would have 3 children and they would all die before her.  But she has had 4 children.  The forgotten child is a plot hole.  A person doesn't forget they've had a child before. ",294,515,False,self,,,,,

This is not an original idea, and I realize that it has been suggested many times before. This is also not a ""Targs are immune to fire"" post, because they aren't. 

But I noticed there were two separate mentions of a funeral pyre in S6E1 (in scenes involving Ramsay and Daenerys, respectively). Coincidence? I think not.

Perhaps Shireen was the blood sacrifice to allow Jon to miraculously return to life (in a manner that would parallel Dany's miracle in Khal Drogo's funeral pyre). At any rate, it seems the showrunners wanted the audience to remember what happened to Dany (as well as what the NW does to its dead to avoid them coming back as wights).

They can use this to develop cool stories, relationships, characters, and sequences. They can build a really cool dynamic between Daario and Jorah and between Grey Worm and Tyrion and of course Daenerys and all the Dthraki Widows. I'm sure they will for the first two but I'm not sure about the ladder. In my opinion Daenerys has developed a strong head on her shoulders but that has always been with the help of an army usually. I'm not saying she can't still be a strong character and maybe it would be cool to see her have to deal with the fact that without an army or Khal to guard she really doesn't have much power. I just don't want Daenerys who has morphed into one of my favorite parts of the show moping around being boring. 

My biggest concern is that they are simply doing this to shoehorn new plot-lines in with Tyrion and Jorah. This will definitely be interesting seeing Tyrion with the power to govern like he should have had with Casterly Rock and as I mentioned earlier the Daario and Jorah storyline will be very cool as well, probably, getting to see some good fights and the inner turmoil Jorah is going through. I just don't want to see Daenerys moping around what could otherwise be such a cool premise.

Jamie's knighthood vow ended up contradicting itself when Aemon Targerean - who he swore to obey - ordered him to kill en-masse innocent civilians in Kings Landing - who he had sworn to protect. Daenerys had to become a politician to keep her Kingdom running. Oberyn was a sentimental romantic whose fighting style consisted of ballet with a spear, and he was killed by an eight foot rapist who tripped him up and jumped on him when he wasn't looking.


Given all that, how do we end up with scenes wherein a female knight her comic-relief sidekick and an emaciated eunuch kill six professional soldiers and two 200lb hunting dogs in about ninety seconds of choreographed Hollywood vomit, by the end of which their only injury is that they're slightly out of breath. They don't even have blood on their clothes. To end the scene the noble knight pays homage to the pretty young princess while patriotic violins weep in the background. Wasn't there an important scene in a bath, a few seasons ago, wherein Jamie explained to this very knight why the knighthood vows are self-contradicting and impossible to uphold? And now D&amp;D want to forget that and romanticise knighthood and fealty again?


I don't think GRRM ever intended to make the story overly dark or gritty, I think he just wanted an accurate representation of the historical record. But for HBO it's just become a gimmick, an obligation to the death, rape, or dismemberment of one or two important characters per season, just as South Park used to be obligated to make a 'you killed Kenny' joke every episode, until they realised they were only doing it for its own sake.

It felt typical of GRRM and ASOIAF for her escape and freedom to be so short lived.

But then Brienne. And I was delighted and excited for this reunion. It was awesome to see her come in and kick ass, with Podrick on clean-up duty.

Thinking more about this today, this scene was so uncharacteristic of GRRM and the story itself. This is a classic deus ex machina moment. It was a storytelling device that is seldom used in this show (and the books) and it was wild to see. What are the odds that Brienne and Pod, after a huge woodland battle, stumble onto them? People are talking about the odds of Jorah finding the ring, but this feels truly lucky for Brienne. I'm not complaining at all about it -- I loved this scene. 

I am not sure if anybody had a similar sentiment, but I just realized this after the fact today. I'm glad that scene happened, and I don't have any beef with the device. It served a great purpose to further the story, quite frankly. A lot of hate on the Sand Snakes today (rightly so), but a little love for the North is warranted.",9,12,False,self,,,,,

* She is completely broken, and has no drive to keep going at this point.
* Davos says, ""You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.""

Davos saying this implies that he still believes in her power. In this situation, it seems like he's thinking of Mel's powers in more of an offensive capability than anything. Think about it... they're locked in that room with Jon's body and know that there is no way out for anyone in their without blood being spilled. Davos sends Edd off to get the Wildlings, but he believes that Mel is the ace up his sleeve. He has seen her birth a shadow-demon, but other than that, what feats of magic has he witnessed from her that would give him the kind of hope he seems to have in her?

I don't think Davos realizes how down in the dumps that Mel is right now. When she does show up, I expect her to be cold, emo, and clad in black. But something will have to happen to fire her up, pun intended. If Mel is going to exhibit any sort of power that might save them, whether that be lighting Castle Black on fire or bringing Jon back from the dead, she is going to have to have a come to Rhollor moment, and I don't think a pep-talk from Liam will be enough to do it.

* So.... what do you think will be Mel's spark that brings her back to fulfill the arc shes been put on for this season?

My take: I think a possibility here is that Mel sees Liam get a sword put through him. She breaks down and cries over his body, and prays via Thoros. Liam comes back, and then she realizes that maybe its not over for Jon, either. She tries the prayer and fails, and instead, throws an oil lamp onto the floor and drives Longclaw through Ghost over Jon's body. The room ignites with Jon and Mel inside, and after a few aesthetic, sad-Davos and Tormund scenes, Jon and Mel step out from the fire, ~~Hype~~Lightbringer in hand.

I can even see Mel praying over Jon, and the prayer just working a little bit, but not quite starting him up. Like when your engine is cold and you turn the key, and it revs and revs but doesn't quite catch. I can see Jon's body becoming warm again and color flushing back into him during the prayer, and then when Mel sees that it won't be enough, she goes for Ghost.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

If Ellaria went through all that effort earlier to poison Myrcella with a kiss on the docks, why not just get them both at the same time. It would not appear unusual for her to kiss him goodbye, and even if it was...have a sand snake do it. They are family after all. If a writer wanted him dead, it would have been more interesting to have a more meaningful scene. Something like:

* Jamie is grieving over the body of his daughter.
* Slowly rises to anger and stomps over to Trystane's door, the son of the prince who murdered his child (in his mind)
* Golden hand banging away and shouts of rage, finally bashing it in to confront Trystane and kill him or take him hostage for use against Dorne.
* Trystane's body is there on the carpet, just as dead as Myrcella.
* Jamie's face becomes on of confusion and utter failure on all aspects of his mission. He has broken another vow, to return his daughter, and now has nothing to show for it but potential war.

I would prefer that over teleporting cliche women...and that is just what I came up with in like...5 minutes.

To clarify my spoiler tag, I'm going to be talking a lot about Jon Snow, pulling information from the books to discuss what I think is going to happen on the show. So if you want to find out about Jon organically, I suggest avoiding this post.

**End Warning**

Ok, so Jon Snow's not back.... yet. But there's a few good reasons for this, and I'd like to discuss them.

**1. Jon Snow's resurrection is the pivot point (if not, climax) of the entire saga**
When reading the books, it's a lot easier to discern that Jon Snow is the main character of the saga. I've [written](http://pashapiro.com/post/128112893537/who-is-jon-snows-mother) about this [before](http://pashapiro.com/post/130401787253/who-is-jon-snows-mother), but the main points are:

* Jon is the hero of the very first chapter, saving the dire wolves despite himself
* All the early POV characters (excepting Dany) spend time thinking about Jon Snow and his parentage
* The identity of Jon Snow's mother is the first real mystery of the saga
* He maintains the moral high ground (albeit on the edge of a knife), and manages to stay alive (well... mostly)
* ASOIAF and R+L=J. If Aerys married Lyanna to Rhaegar, keeping the Targaryen tradition of kings having two wives, then Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. This seems plausible because the saga is named A Song of Ice and Fire, and Jon Snow is quite literally the son of Ice (Lyanna) and Fire (Rhaegar)

Being that Jon Snow is the hero of the entire saga, his resurrection is not something to waste. It should be one of the most pivotal moments of the series. It's not only the moment that we're getting back a beloved character, but the moment that he is revealed as the exalted hero of the entire saga, the prince that was promised.

Something like that has to be setup well, and I expect they'll be using this entire season to do it.

**2. The show hasn't spent near the time setting up R+L=J**
In the books, we get the following snippets (posted here in chronological order)

* The Stark family gets a taste of Southern hospitality at the Harrenhall Tournament during the Year of the False Spring. Ned falls in love with Ashara Dayne. Lyanna falls in love with Rhaegar. Also, the Starks befriend Howland Reed.
* Shortly thereafter, Lyanna, she of the wolf's blood, elopes with Rhaegar. They honeymoon at the Tower of Joy and conceive a son there.
* On his way to marry Catelyn Tully, Brandon Stark hears Lyanna was captured, gets pissed, and heads to King's Landing to confront Rhaegar, gets Aerys instead.
* After Brandon is imprisoned, Rickard Stark heads to King's Landing 
* Aerys murders Brandon and Rickard, causing younger son Eddard, his friend Robert (Lyanna's betrothed) and their foster father Jon Arryn to raise the banners in rebellion.
* Eddard and Jon Arryn combine their strength with Hoster Tully by marrying Catelyn and Lysa Tully, respectively. Eddard and Catelyn conceive Robb Stark.
* Rhaegar leaves the Tower of Joy, finds out his father murdered his father-in-law and brother-in-law, and that Robert's Rebellion has reached a fever pitch. He leads the Targaryen banners to meet Robert, while also thinking it's time for crazy Aerys to go.
* Tywin Lannister sacks King's Landing.
* Jaime Lannister kills Aerys. Rhaegar becomes King.
* Elia Targaryen ne Martell is murdered by Gregor Clegane. Aegon and Rhaenys are also murdered.
* Robert kills Rhaegar on the Trident.
* Eddard Stark leads Robert's van to King's Landing, finding it sacked by the Lannisters.
* Robert, injured from battle, catches up and takes his seat on the Iron Throne.
* Tywin Lannister presents the corpses of Aegon and Rhaenys to Robert
* Ned gets pissed at the whole thing, argues with Robert, leaves to break the siege of Storm's End and find his sister
* Ned gets to Storm's End. The Martells and Redwynes walk off the field without incident.
* Ned gets 6 friends together, including Howland Reed, and heads to the Tower of Joy to ""free"" his sister.
* Ned finds three Kingsguard at the Tower of Joy. Everyone dies in the ensuing battle except Ned and Howland.
* Ned enters the Tower to find that Lyanna has given birth to a son - the reason the Kingsguard were at the Tower. She dies as a result of the birth.
* Ned returns Ser Arthur Dayne's sword, Dawn, to Ashara Dayne at castle Starfall, also letting her know that he's married Catelyn Stark. The combined news leads her to kill herself. Lyanna's son is nursed for a time at Starfall to a wet nurse name Wylla
* Ned departs Starfall with Lyanna's son, Lyanna's body, and Howland Reed, headed for King's Landing. Having seen what Robert was willing to do to baby Targaryen's, Howland and Ned hatch a plan to hide the child's identity, naming him Jon Snow.
* Robert and Ned patch things up over Lyanna's death, have a few jokes about Ned's new bastard.
* Howland Reed and Ned Stark return north to their homes.
* Ned sends for Catelyn, who arrives at Winterfell with the infant Robb Stark, to find Jon Snow already in residence with a wet nurse.

Only a few of these snippets are actually referred to in the show. For example, show viewers are acutely aware that Tywin and Gregor killed Elia Martell, but haven't seen anything about the Tower of Joy. Assuming the show's saga and the books' saga follow the same outline, a lot of this stuff still has to be revealed to viewers of *Game of Thrones*. A good chunk of it is going to have to come out this season before we can bring Jon Snow back. It's the only way to make his resurrection seem as important as it really is. There's more than enough here to fill five or six episodes. The Tower of Joy stuff could easily take up half an episode.

**3. We haven't met Howland Reed or seen Bran use his flashback Weirwood network**

It's possible I missed it, but I don't recall Jojen and Myra telling Bran the story of the Harrenhall Tournament in the show. Howland Reed is the only living person with a first hand account of Jon Snow's origin. We have to meet Howland Reed and have him establish a relationship with someone with whom he can confide the secret of Jon Snow.

Likewise, Bran is going to be able to see many things from the past take place through the eyes of the many Weirwood trees in Westeros. He'll be able to see flashbacks from his father's childhood at Winterfell, his mother's childhood at Riverrun - but nothing from the Eyrie, because the Godswood there doesn't have a heart tree. In any case, a lot of Jon Snow's story could be revealed this way.

**4. Melisandre's story arc peaks with Jon Snow's resurrection**
As others have said already, Melisandre seems to be going through a crisis of faith. This sticks to George R. R. Martin's style of plunging characters into crisis by taking away the things they cherish the most - Jaime and his sword hand, Sansa and her position/chastity, Cersei and her children, Eddard and the North. Taking Melisandre's faith away from her will give her a chance to go through a similar crisis, that will culminate with her resurrecting Jon Snow.

Plus they can explain that the glamour she's been using is something akin to what the Faceless men are using, and has little to do with potions and ruby necklaces, right? Amiright?

All of these reasons point to a Jon Snow resurrection much later this season - possibly not until next season. They may want to fit all of this action into a three-day span in the show, solidifying Jon Snow as the Westerosi Jesus.",26,76,False,self,,,,,

Story is supposed to be comprised of a series of events, along with reveals, witty dialogue, interesting characters, themes, etc.  But the core of what a story is is a series of events which we experience through the characters.  

But nothing happened in this episode - except for 2 things.  First, Sansa and Brienne forged an alliance, and Ellaria and daughters killed the Martells (which wasn't very interesting for many, including myself, it seems).  Instead, what we witnessed were more reactionary, or a reminder of where the characters are currently situated.

Let's take a look at what (didn't) happened:

-Tyrion and Dickless walk and see things

-Cersei and Jamie cry and get angry

-Daeni doesn't talk and talks

-Davos and company literally wait

-Melisandre goes to bed

-Arya gets into a street fight of no significance

-Margaery asks about her husband

-Ramsey talks with his father

So, in my opinion, nothing really happens in this episode, which is truly disappointing.  I know the big reveal about Melisandre is something, but it's not enough; a story isn't a series of revelations.  Something has to happen.  Even what so many found to be clever/funny dialogue... I found them to be cheap distractions.

This worries me because this is the first off book episode and was a test of D&amp;D story writing abilities.  I'm sorry to say I was disappointed and pray that the rest of the season isn't like this.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

I get that it wasnt Doran's fault, but without going back and facing the Sands or Doran wouldn't it be more pertinent to take him in as a hostage (Theon at Winterfell style, not lock him in a dungeon). It's the safest bet since you just had your princess killed by a country and you have their prince.



And if that isn't your cup of tea, it seems even more odd that Jamie let him stay on the boat and didn't invite him to grieve with the family. Jamie know that they loved each other, if he harbored no I'll will toward the kid then he should feel empathy and invite him in.

The Father: represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead.

The Mother: represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as ""the strength of women"".


The Maiden: represents purity, innocence, love, and beauty.


**The Crone: represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern.**


The Warrior: represents strength and courage in battle.


The Smith: represents creation and craftsmanship.


The Stranger: The Stranger represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to.

Throughout the whole series, we haven't spent much time focusing on a characters death as much as we are Jon's. GoT has been using him as marketing material and was a good focus of last seasons finally and this seasons premiere. Not even Ned was as part of the plot as Jon is after his death. 

So why? I think it's there way of showing us that Jon is still going to be a major part of the plot whether that be as Azor Ahai or White Walker Jon.

Then I saw Jaimie's actor on Stephen Colbert. I remember thinking it was awkward when Stephen asked and didn't understand why he asked but Stephen asked him about the ""powerful women on the show"" and of course he talked up the women actors and characters. I can understand the damage control but I felt they kinda copped out and put together a boring season premiere simply because they were doing their best not to offend anyone. 

Plus you couple that with the fact this is the first season that Game of Thrones is working without source material other than notes from Martin I think it brings to light D&amp;D's writing style more and the fact their instinct with extra creative freedom is to go this route concerns me going forward.

One of the big fear I had for this season is the absurd number of storylines they have to fit in 10 episodes : Bran, The Night's Watch, The North/Sansa, the Lannisters/Tyrells, the Greyjoys, Sam, Dorne, Arya, Dany/Jorah&amp;Daario and Mereen. It they manage it all I'll actually be pretty impressed. In the case of Dorne it's even worse because what I expected was for Doran to realise he's been tricked, and take Ellaria's head. And then... what? You can't really have him reveal he schemed his revenge all this time since it's based on a character who has been cut from the show, and if you bring him back it's one more storyline added to the list. The only alternative I can see would be if Trystane had made it to KL, only to be murdered by a vengeful Cersei. That might have been the last straw for Doran, who would have then declared war on the Lannisters. But, honestly, seeing how little time they had on their hands, I think this isn't that bad of an alternative. Not an elegant one, that's for sure, but it sets things into motion and it's consistent with the plot from S5. Honestly, without this, the poisoning of Myrcella by Elleria would not have made much sense, why kill her only to be beheaded afterwards? It's kind of weak sauce for a vengeance. Also, I find it very ""GameofThronesque"" for Hotah to be stabbed in the back and go down like that, despite being a badass fighter (shameful, yes, but it's in the spirit of the show, so I don't mind). The only real problem I have with it is the question of who is going to take control of Dorne, since all the Martells seems dead and Ellaria doesn't really strike me as ""Princess material"". Maybe it's kind of the point though, having her little vengeance fantasy bring only chaos and death upon Dorne. 
So, in short, yes it's a shame we didn't get Doran's epic speech about grass and the Sand Snakes aren't the best actresses on this show, but I still think it's better than the long crawl it is in the books, we -sadly- just don't have time for those super long set up in the show.

Also, Melisandre's been around for 200 years and yet, she's crisis of faith. She should have known that she's tested by the R'hllor. 

@EDIT:
I thought it was obvious. I'm trying to say that it's not necklace that helps her with her trick. Why? Because Kinvara (thank you for that name) has the same necklace.
I'm sure it was a potion but after I've read that reddit it looks like it wasn't clearly enough for some people. That's why I've wrote this.

5748,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-4-26,2016,4,26,2,4gefbv,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Season 6 Episode 1 Recap - The Red Woman : Insurrection Chaos breeds Ascension Opportunities,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gefbv/everything_season_6_episode_1_recap_the_red_woman/,HeatherManifestation,1461605753,"Lord Littlefinger looms large over the Season 6 opener ""The Red Woman"". Though he does not make an appearance, his hands can be seen in many of the events in the episode.

Lord Littlefinger declared in Episode 6 of Season 3 that he believes that ""Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."" This is very helpful in understanding the character's motives in The Game of Thrones.

Sansa is the obvious catalyst for naming Littlefinger as a primary schemer behind the episode. He has an obsession for her due to his love for Catelyn Stark. Sansa knows that Littefinger is using her to help reclaim the North, but she is using that to her advantage to start having actual power and an army. Sansa is Littlefinger's blind spot, and she knows that Littlefinger will allow her to move up in the ranks of rulership as he moves his plans and pieces forward. Sansa and Theon are saved by Brienne and Pod in the episode. In grouping these people, Littlefinger has a claim to be Warden of the North and influence via Sansa on the rightful heir to the Iron Islands controlled by Balon Greyjoy. Theon isn't respected in the Iron Islands, but the claim will be useful when backed by an army that Littlefinger may assign later to claim the kingdom. Brienne is loyal, which should remind everyone of the nobility of the Vale that Littlefinger knows precisely how to manipulate. Brienne may not be on Littlefinger's radar, but she is a powerful ally that comes with has grooming Sansa into a powerful leadership position.

Littlefinger is focused mainly on influencing Lords. Littlefinger must be on an important mission to let Sansa be used by Ramsay Bolton. The reason for allowing the Bolton's power was the promise by Cersei to be Wardon of the North for bring the Bolton's and Stannis banners to heel. Stannis is dead, so now Littlefinger needs to find an army willing to unite possibly with the Vale to defeat the Bolton's who are hated by most nobles in the North. Sansa is an easily uniting figure for the Lords of the North, but someone must go around to convince the good men to act due to the tendency of Lords to the natural tendency of Lords to only act to maintain their current power. The North is ready to unite under Sansa with the help of Littlefinger, who will control the Vale and the North.

Last season ended in the death of Princess Myrcella Baratheon was induced by poison. Though Littlefinger was not implicated in the show, it must be remembered that it is a favorite tactic of Littlefinger due to the death of King Joffrey. Littlefinger has been using the Lannisters for a long time to provide a fascade for his true intentions. Tyrion famously pointed out that ""Our enemies hate each other, almost as much as they hate us."" Lannister has been using the hatred of the Lannisters to gain allies. The southern nation of Dorne is now under the control of a female leader that wants to see her nation strong and left alone by Westeros. Littlefinger wouldn't let Dorne break away, but he is smart enough to give them more autonomy that would be mutually agreeable to Ellaria and the Sand Snakes. Ellaria provides additional armies to Littlefinger to attack King's Landing and any enemies from opposite ends of the kingdom. No one would know where the attack would come from by Littlefinger. This additionally gives him great influence in four of the seven kingdoms, mainly from areas that are on the edges that would conform to a surround and siege maneuver. Encircling tactics on a larger scale are also possible with the surround tactic.

Littlefinger also has connections to High Garden due to Joffrey's death, so that gives him blackmail ability over a fifth kingdom. The Kingdom of the Rock controlled by House Lannister is obviously a sticking point, but the House of Lannister has been dying at an increasing rate thanks to moves by the enemies that the Lannister's haven't been able to control.

The Lord of Light's and the newfound militant slant of the Seven-Faced Gods feed into the Chaos. Littlefinger wouldn't mind any religion taking a prominent place, as long as he sits atop the political power structure. He is using both organizations to destabilize the regions that he doesn't control, and creating a populous uprising to legitimize the religious organizations into removing the current rulers.

Arya is a wildcard in Littlefinger's plans, but luckily with Sansa at his side she will not likely oppose him. Melisandre is consumed with the upcoming war with the dead, and doesn't want direct power. Littlefinger can play on her intense focus to promise troops for the war when the time comes that the dead attack. Varys and Tyrion are of course Littlefinger's main obstacles. He surely has spies listening to how the two are backing Daenerys. Daenerys would have a better claim to the throne, so prepare for Littlefinger to have plot attempts by third parties to assassinate Daenerys. She likely won't die, but some of her favorite protectors will when the attempts are thwarted.

So what is Littlefinger likely to accomplish? Littlefinger will be able to take over the Vale and the North, and then have firm alliances with House Tyrell and Dorne. The four will take King's Landing from the Lannisters due to their weaken state forced by the Faith Militant. Littlefinger will allow Sansa to take out House Frey. The Tyrell's will marry of Margery to enforce the alliance, but possibly not directly to Littlefinger due to Sansa. Littlefinger will be able to bask in his success in claiming the Chaos ladder.

Of course his greatest enemies back an entirely different approach to power in backing Daenerys, Baratheon. Starks. Tyrell. Theyre all just spokes on a wheel. This ones on top, then that ones on top, and on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground. Im not going to stop the wheel. Im going to break the wheel. Time will tell how these forces meet, but Littlefinger will have accomplished creating an unbalanced political and military vacuums in Westeros for Varys and Tyrion to exploit.

I'm not here to claim otherwise, but I also think that people are quick to judge and assume worst. 

Personally, I think last episode's events were a shot of adrenaline that the storyline desperately needed. In S5, nothing noteworthy seemed to happen in Dorne, except Myrcella's death, and that was at the last second. 

Anyway, I think lot of people criticize the events of the recent episode mainly because of a few apparent plot holes (and the usual hatred towards Dorne, but that cannot be remedied anymore). But I think most of these are not plot holes at all. 

One that gets the most attention, is how the two Sand Snakes got into Trystan's boat, but I think it's so easy to explain, I'm not gonna spend much time there. Ellaria knew where the ship was headed, so they went there after them, on a different ship. No need to follow. Could the show have shown that? Absolutely, but it's such a minor detail, that I think there is no need to dwell in it. 

One of the main ones I've also seen is that why the palace guards did nothing to help their lord when Ellaria attacked. Maybe they were supporting Ellaria's cause, but then why they didn't do anything while Jaime and Myrcella were still in Dorne. Why they waited? And why they even helped Doran and Areo arresting Sand Snakes in S5, if they were supporting their cause? Did they magically turn their cloaks between the seasons? 

My answer: Yes, and no. 

Obviously these events depicted were planned by writers after S5 had aired. But I think they make sense if we are open to it. And unfortunately, after the disappointment of S5, many people are not, and would rather just condemn the whole thing as lazy writing. 

Let's look at what we got. At S5E2, Ellaria states to Doran: 
""The whole country would have you to go to war.""
Doran: ""Then we are lucky the whole country doesn't decide.""
So clearly the majority of population wants war for what happened to Oberyn, and Doran is the one stopping that from happening. Ellaria also states that the Snakes have the love of the people. 

This is a case of telling, not showing, which is unfortunate. Like I said, the storyline suffers from execution problems, but at least we have something from before that supports the events of the recent episode. 

Then why did the palace guards, who are with Ellaria in S6E1, help Doran in S5E6 to stop Sand Snakes? 

As GameofThronesWiki states: 
""It is also confusing that in this episode, Ellaria points out that not even one of Doran's guards (other than Areo) rush to his defense when she stabs him, because they all think he's weak and agree with her actions - when during the Sand Snakes' attack on Myrcella in Season 5, they all joined Areo to stop the Sand Snakes. It might be possible that the way he dealt with this incident, insisting that he still wouldn't fight the Lannisters, is what was meant to be what drove them over the edge to side with Ellaria: in which case, they wouldn't turn on Doran for taking no action to avenge his brother, but do turn against him for stopping his nieces from killing a political hostage (and young girl at that) who was a formal guest in his own castle - even though in Season 4, Oberyn himself insisted that he would never want to harm Myrcella because the thought of killing a little girl who was a non-combatant was abhorrent to Dornish honor.""
http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Red_Woman

Because, from their point of view, the guards weren't summoned to stop the harming of a little girl. No one knew this was happening, although Doran obviously had an idea that something was going on. Without Jaime and Bronn, Sand Snakes would have been successful in their kidnapping, and the guards came only after a prolonged fight, during which Doran understood what was happening at the moment, and ordered the arrest of all parties and Ellaria. 

From the guards' perspective, they were summoned to stop a fight between Sand Snakes and palace guards, who are very soon revealed to be disguised Lannisters, not Dornish guards at all. Lannisters, the same people who killed their Oberyn and Elia, were now in Dorne, in their palace, wearing bloodied robes of their killed kin, and fighting against their people, with the prince knocked unconscious. 
The guards disarm all combatants due to orders from Areo, who is, of course, doing Doran's bidding. But we can see that Obara Sand tries to talk to palace guards, to reason with them. 

So, to say that the guards were there to protect Myrcella from Sand Snakes, is misleading at best, completely false at worst. Probably Oberyn was right, that harming a little girl would go against Dornish honor. But the guards were there simply so that the fight and the whole situation wouldn't get out of hand. 

What happens next? What does Doran do to these Lannister invaders who have killed their people, who tried to kidnap betrothed princess in secrecy? He offers them tea and drinks to their health. After that, he sends them back, and wishes them well. He even gives them what they want and lets them take Myrcella with them. The punishment for hurting the prince? One punch. Even Jaime expected them to be beheaded. 

This is all wise diplomatically, so Doran is doing all the right moves (like Robb thought he did, or Ned), but considering the pro-war sentiment of his people, it doesn't look good on the outside. The guards see an aggressor, a hated Lannister, who is let go unpunished and their lord bowing before him. Is it a surprise that after all this, they decide to go with Ellaria? 

Ellaria then goes on to poison Myrcella, because no one else probably would have, to provoke war with Lannisters, like was her intent. Between the seasons, she gets the support from the royal guard, and when the moment comes, the guards stand aside and watch their weak lord killed. 

Makes sense? Although I do acknowledge that I have made a grave sin by defending Dorne, but to me, this chain of events does make sense. The show could have shown it better (and maybe they will), but they are definitely on the right track in making Dorne more exciting. Does this have anything to do with the books? Of course not, but you have to let go of that, if you, for some reason, haven't already. ",3,14,False,self,,,,,

Why does everyone hate Olly so much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gerzs/everything_finally_caught_up_why_does_everyone/,jamsterbuggy,1461610150,"So I finally caught up on GoT last night, just in time for the season 6 premiere.  I've been going through this Subreddit and /r/asoiaf throughout the day, and I've noticed that pretty much everyone seems to have Olly as their most hated character, which I'm a little confused about. 

Characters like Ser Allister and Ramsey seem far more despicable to me, but I don't see people hating on them nonstop.  And a lot of Olly's actions made sense to me.  His parents were murdered and eaten by the Wildlings right in front of him, so it's understandable why he'd hate them. 

I see two things people say they really hate about him; killing Ygritte and getting the final stab on Jon Snow.  

Ygritte had a bow aimed at Jon, and was going to kill him.  Olly saved his life by shooting her.  Don't quote me on this, but I think I remember Ygritte killing one of his parents too. 

Olly seemed very conflicted when he stabbed Jon.  Jon treated Olly with respect and took him under his wing, but he was letting the Wildlings come through the wall.  Again, Olly watched his parents get killed and eaten by these guys at s young age.  You could see how upset and conflicted Olly was when he stabbed Jon too.  

Am I missing something about all this Olly hate, or is it just a meme/overreaction?",10,3,False,self,,,,,

We're officially off book now, the show has by-and-large moved past the events of A Feast For Crows and A Dance with Dragons and into it's own territory, which we can assume for the large part will be it's own beast going forward, and draw some plot points that will be in The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring based off of what George R. R. Martin has told the creators of the show.   So what does that mean for this series of posts?

Sadly that means that this season will likely be the last I can reliably bring you these posts, there is little I haven't already covered in my previous posts, and very few book to show comparisons I can make. I am still determined to bring an episode to you a week this season however, and may have to draw some editorial type posts to fill in when an episode doesn't give me anything to work with, but we will see how that unfolds as the series progresses.  

For today however I want to dive into one of the show's most controversial storylines and tackle Dorne in the Books vs Dorne in the show.. not in an attempt to harp on the show's plot line in this season and in the last, but in an effort to demonstrate the different character dynamics, and plot-lines to how they unfolded in the novels.   I plan to do this in three parts, first covering the ruling family of Dorne, and the Sand Snakes, the Myrcella plot line differences, and finally what we can expect from Dorne going forward in both the novels and in the show... I hope you all enjoy

**Note on Spoiler Scope**

FINALLY, I have no need to hinder myself... We are past the books and the gloves are off.... I can now use the ~~Spoilers All~~ EVERYTHING spoiler scope, that being said anything from the books and from the show is fair game...This post however if you wish to know will largely deal with the Dorne plot as was laid down in A Feast for Crows and a bit from A Dance With Dragons.. so there is no reason in this post to fear from the non-reader being spoiled on anything upcoming... However in the last section I will briefly discuss a The Winds of Winter preview chapter released by George R. R. Martin, and will hide that behind the appropriate spoiler tag.  With the differences from book to show, that particular chapter won't be adapted to the show, so it's still non-reader safe, but I'm tagging for the benefit of readers who are avoiding the preview chapters.  I will also very briefly touch on a fan theory regarding one of the Sand Snakes in ADWD that I won't be tagging towards the end of the post

With that out of the way, let's begin..



-----


#**The Ruling House of Martell**#

**The Family of Doran Martell**

- Trystane

The show has established that Prince Doran Martell has only one child, his son and heir Trystane, who like his father met his end at the hand of the Sand Snakes in this episode, however not much really happens with his book counterpart..  In the novels he is the youngest cild of Prince Doran, only 13 years old and like his show counterpart betrothed to Myrcella Baratheon (10 in the books).  He spends his day with his betrothed at Sunspear throughout AFFC &amp; ADWD.  Not only is he not the eldest son, that being his brother Quentyn, he is not the heir to Dorne, that would be the eldest child of Doran, his sister Arianne 

- Arianne 

Won't get too much into her character and storyline here, as it will be covered in depth in the next section, but this character, the daughter and eldest child of Doran is the heir to Dorne.  Due to Dornish customs the eldest child inherits the seat of Dorne, not the eldest son, and she is set to be Princess of Dorne when her father dies..  She values the Dornish view of love and sex and has had many paramours, at the time of AFFC she is having an affair with Ser Arys Oakheart, a member of the Kingsguard assigned to protect Myrcella.  She is strong willed,  determined, and quarrels with her father regarding the matter of The Lannisters as something to be dealt with as opposed to the cautious nature of her father, and empathizes with her cousins, The Sand Snakes, in holding Kings Landing responsible for the death of Oberyn, as well as the past sins of House Lannister.  She often feels distant from her father and uncomfortable in her inheritance, due to her father's tendancy to favor her younger brother and Doran's elder son Quentyn

- Quentyn

I won't go into much here, as I already covered Quentyn's plot-line in my last post from last season, which I highly suggest you read., [The Mereenese Knot](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3a220a/s5adwd_the_meereenese_knot_adding_context_for/), but for this post I will state that during the time of AFFC/ADWD he is believed to be serving as a ward under house Yronwood, and does not appear in the Dornish plot-line that unfolded in AFFC.   

- The Sand Snakes

The 8 daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell are as fierce and wild in the books as the show....*attempts to portray them*.  While there are 8 of them both the show and the books focus on the eldest three, Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene, so for this posts they will be the focus when discussing the Sand Snakes.  And while they play a large part in season 5 and appear to be in season 6, the are relatively absent from the plot in AFFC. 

The Sand Snakes at the beginning of AFFC are very vocal about the death of their father and demand justice; they also have the large support of Dorne at their heels.  Doran wanting to avoid war with the Lannisters and quell any mention of rebellion  that his nieces have drummed up  has all 8 of the Sand Snakes locked away in the tower of Sunspear for the duration of AFFC, but to their credit they have an ally to their interests on the outside, their cousin Arianne. 

- Ellaria Sand

I will briefly cover some of the differences between the show depiction of Ellaria vs the book deception.  While in both the novels and in the shows she is distraught and angered over the death of Oberyn, she is much more cautious and much more in favor of diplomacy as opposed to her show counterpart, she plays no real active role in the events of AFFC, and remains at The Water Gardens, but is present for many of the events that unfolded in Dorne in ADWD (covered in the final section)


---------


#**The Plot to Crown Myrcella Baratheon**#

- The Setup

Arianne, The princess of Dorne is in a precarious state at the beginning of AFFC.  She sees her biggest allies and cousins locked away by her own father, she sees her father's decision not to challenge the Lannisters for the death of Oberyn, and their past sins as weak and foolish, and she is also very concerned about the state of her birth right...the seat of Dorne..  She learns early on that her brother Quentyn has left the wardship of House Yronwood  and traveled across the narrow sea, for reasons unknown to her, and reasons she incorrectly (as we will later learn) believes is her brother attempting to steal away her inheritance from her.  

Seeing all these threats to herself and to her homeland she hatches a plan.  Claiming the law of Dornish primogeniture she leads a plot to crown Myrcella Barathon queen of the seven kingdoms and overthrow Myrcella's brother Tommen.   She enlists the help of a handful of friends, most notably a Ser Gerold Dayne who goes by his nickname Darkstar, cousin to the famous Kingsguard knight Authur Dayne, and joined as well by current Kingsguard knight Ser Arys Oakheart.  Together they are successful in sneaking Myrcella away from Sunspear and placing a decoy in her stead.. Their ultimate plan is to take her to Lord of House Uller, father of Ellaria Sand, and from there crown here and proclaim Dorne for Myrcella Baratheon, and to finally provoke the War with the Lannisters that she, her cousins and many Dornish have been waiting for for over a decade... But plans in A Song of Ice and Fire never seem to go as planned.  

- The Failed execution

The plan was doomed from the start, her companions included a deluded knight who broke his vows for an unrequited love, and a knight that would suggest that outright murdering Myrcella would be the quickest way to the war that she wanted, but little did she know that the plain would fail due to one of her lesser companions selling their plan out. During their journey north, Arianne and company were cornered by the forces of Prince Doran, and their captain Areo Hotah.   Realizing that her plot had failed Arianne wished to yeild without bloodshed, but neither of her knightly companions were having any of it.  In a last ditch effort to reclaim some of the honor he believed he lost by breaking his Kingsguard vows, Ser Arys Oakheart charged the Dornish force and fought valiantly until he was killed by Aero Hotah... Ser Gerold, he who is of the night however did something even more rash... he took the opportunity of the chaos that Ser Arys caused to make an attempt on the live of Myrcella Baratheon, and if it weren't for the chaos that caused Myrcella's horse to turn at the last moment, she would of died there and then... Darkstars sword only managed to take Myrcella's ear instead of her head.   Darkstar managed to escape the battle, but Arianne and the rest of her companions were captured and returned to Sunspear.  The plot had failed, and left princess Myrcella badly scarred.  

-------


#**Doran's Long Con**#

- Fire and Blood

The biggest difference going forward with Dorne is how the aftermath of what transpired in AFFC played out.  The biggest thing is that Doran was not the weak, Lannister placating fool we believed him to be in the book (and that he kind of remained in the show).. He was merely playing the long game 

After the let's crown Myrcella plan fails horribly Arianne is kept for several days in a tower cell at Sunspear with no contact of the outside world until she is summoned to the chamber of her uncle.  In this meeting with his daughter and her, Doran reveals that he and Oberyn had been working for over a decade in an attempt to undermine and overthrow House Baratheon.. He reveals that shortly after Robert's Rebellion that prince Oberyn had met with Ser Willem Darry (Guardian of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen) and arranged a marriage pact between their houses.. That Arianne would be betrothed prince Viserys, and when he came of age Dorne would proclaim for him in an attempt to reclaim the Iron Throne... unfortunately this plan crashed and burned when Viserys was killed by Khal Drogo, but hoped to keep the pact alive by sending his son Quentyn across the narrow sea to court the Mother of Dragons and once again align the Sun and Spear to the Dragon.   

(That plan too went horribly amiss for Quentyn, and if you wish to read about that, once again it was covered in the Mereenese Knot post I did last year, that I linked above..)

- Setting up the Dornish chess pieces in A Dance With Dragons

With the cat out of the bag regarding where the loyalty truly lies it is laid out in A Dance With Dragons what moves Droan makes in his preparation to betray the Iron Throne.  With his full confidence in Arianne he releases her as well as the Sand Snakes from their imprisonment. The biggest issue facing the Martells at the moment is how to deal with princess Myrcella's injury and the fact that Ser Balon Swann of the Kingsguard is traveling to Dorne at that moment.   

Doran with the help of his Daughter and the Sand Snakes convince the princess to lie to ser Balon on how her injury was obtained, and to never mention the plot that failed to crown her..Telling  him truly that Ser Gerold Dayne injured her in an attempt to kill her, and falsely telling him that Dayne also murdered Ser Arys Oakheart.. The lie works and Ser Balon swan adopts a mission to hunt down Darkstar. For their troubles Doran and Dorne as a whole is presented with the skull of Gregor Clegane, The Mountain, as a piece offering for the murder of Elia Martell over a decade prior, another piece token offered by Cersei (this all takes place before her arrest) is an invitation for Doran to travel to Kings Landing to finally take up his seat on the Small Council, and an invite for Tristane to come along and see the capital..    However due to the dubious behavior of Ser Balon when Doran brings up methods of travel, and from reports by Doran's spies he learns that Cersei's invitation is a falsehood, that during their travel to Kings Landing that their party would be set upon by outlaws planning to murder Trystane and frame Tyrion Lannister as the culprit.  With Doran as a witness to the events as Cersei wishes to them to play out, it would also clear her of any blame in Trystane's death. 

Doran's moves in response to this are quick, he cannot directly kill Ser Balon nor confront him about the plot, this is when he reveals the nature of Myrcella's injures to Ser Balon, changing his plans and setting him about his hunt for Ser Gerold Dayne... to accompany Ser Balon Doran sends his niece Obara, the eldest Sand Snake, to accompany him in his hunt.. 

The other Sand Snakes are not without their missions either.. Doran chooses not to travel to Kings Landing, instead he sends two more of his nieces in his stead. Nymeria to take his spot on the small council and Tyene to make friends with the High Sparrow at the sept of Baelor in Kings Landing.  But that's not even it..  The 4th eldest Sand Snake, Sarella, is widely believed to be in training at the Citadel in training to become a Maester, in disguise and under the pseudonym Alleras (Sarella spelled backwards)... what is her plans and how does it play into Doran's plans if at all?  I guess we'll find out in The Winds of Winter.   

- Two wrenches in Doran's plan  

The last two things I want to bring up are two significant issues that could drastically impact how Doran plays his game from here on out... the most significant is the death of his son Quentyn that came about in an ill advised attempt to steal Dragons in Mereen (once again very detailed in my Mereenese Knot post)... How will Doran react to this, to know that his marriage pact ultimately failed as Dany had married a Mereenese nobleman?  Will he blame Dany and challenge Kings Landing on his own?  This too will remain to be seen in The Winds of Winter.

The last thing that I wish to bring up involves the preview chapter from The Winds of Winter that was released of GRRM's website a couple of years ago, and it involves a character that appears in ADWD but has been cut from the show..  I will leave this bit behind a tag if you wish to avoid it, and if that's the case I will see you in my sign off, but if not let's touch on this point a bit.. 

[TWOW preview chapter spoilers/ADWD spoilers](#b ""In the preview chapter Doran learns  of the landing of Aegon at Rook's Rest, the believed-to-be-dead son of Rheagar Targaryen, proclaiming himself King Aegon VI Targaryen.  This letter was sent by Aegon's adoptive father, former hand of the king to Aerys Targarye, and former companion of Rhaegar Targaryen, Jon Connington.. Intrigued by the possibility of his sister's son being alive, he dispatches his daughter to Rook's Rest to meet with Aegon, along with several of her closest companions including the 5th eldest Sand Snake, Elia Sand...to what end will this lead... who knows?  We all await the next book, and only George has the answers"")

-------


Well, that's it for this week, I hope you all enjoy being back and enjoyed learning a bit about how the Dornish plot has played out in the books compared to the show.  They have been two very different plot lines, and very doubtful that the show will draw elements from the book's version of Dorne... (especially after killing off all the Martells) but it's fun to know, and it was fun to revisit for me and rediscover the intricacies that George has laid out where the sun shines the hottest.  That's it for me this week.

 I hope to see you back next week.. Until then you can fill your time by reading some of the older posts in the adding context for non-readers [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gfi7w/everything_adding_context_for_nonreaders_hub_for/)...

A post breaking down the theories on Jon Snow's parentage which can be read [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3dkarn/s5adwdtheory_theory_breakdown_jon_snows_parentage/) and a post breaking down, in detail the full line of succession to the Iron Throne which can be read [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4041bx/all_spoilerstheory_the_detailed_line_of/)

By contrast, the only mention we have of Stannis the the Boltons talking about how He is dead but they don't know so killed him, which is done in such a way that it is unclear whether they actually have the body (in which case why wouldn't you show it?) or whether Ramsey was just saying he was dead to please his dad. That seems like foreshadowing to me.

So what is up with Stannis? No idea. Maybe Sansa or the Nights Watch will find his multilated corpse in the snow.

The themes and struggles, ""power is power""! Information is power, the name is power, etc. All this big discussions and themes on who and how controlled what and why in Westeros (and beyond with the iron bank, khals and khalisees, etc).

And then in season five just shit all over that and in a matter of a half dozen awful scenes introduced three otherwise unheard of factions that are now in control. Which of these do you like the least:

1) **The Sparrows**. We are more powerful than the queen, king, and all of kings landing, and even Olennas threats are meaningless because why would the people follow the Tyrells and their leaders, when we showed up and broke all of their wine barrels, banned fornication and brothels, and all that other great stuff the commoners hate amiright?

2) **The Harpys**. So remember that first part with the Sparrows and how the common people are more important than having the support of anyone else in power or other leaders? Ignore that in Mereen, where the handful of previous slave owners and upper class people can handle the unsullied, they weren't all they were cracked up to be I guess with those spears in narrow alleys. Tyrion talking about ruling without the support of the rich and powerful makes you realize at least one of these two plots doesn't agree with the other. Having our cake in Westeros and eating it in Essos with those concepts of power.

3) **The Sand Snakes**. It's the fucking sand snakes we all know how ridiculous it is that they would have power, influence, importance in Dorne over the Martells to somehow magically manage to completely contradict everything Oberyn and Doran ever stood for at the same time, when they had wildly different approaches. You like Dorans style, you hate the Sand Snakes. You like Oberyns completely different style? You still hate the sand Snakes. They make no sense.

Bonus Option: Allister Thornes speech to the nights watch about how loyalty is the most important thing for holding the nights watch together after murdering the lord commander because he was worried about the decisions he was making.

&amp;nbsp;

^(edit. or of course some of these can kind of be defended, a lot of this was obviously hyperbole and a little tongue in cheek as there are some difference or otherwise legitimate reasons some of the stuff that has taken place has taken place, but in general, from what the show has given us, this is just a prima facie reaction to mostly season five)",3,1,False,self,,,,,

*The following is complete conjecture and is likely to be thrown out the window the instant a future episode supplies new information on exactly what the hell happened in Dorne. That being said, I agree that the plot is a mess- but it's what we have to work with, and I'm going to take a crack at possibly filling in some of the holes in a way that hopefully won't end up with me sounding like a raging loony.* Enjoy!

***

To get started let's state the plot holes that desperately need resolution:

A) *Why*, if Ellaria &amp; the Sand Snakes were going to attempt a coup on Doran &amp; Tristane, didn't they just kill everyone at the docks before they set sail? Why use poison to kill Myrcella if the Trystane's assassination and the coup were already in progress?

B) How did the two SS's manage to casually just show up aboard the ship to kill off Trystane?

C) (In the case of Trystane's murder) why use weapons so ill-suited for combat in a ship's cabin?

***

SMH, this ***is*** a mess... Ah well, I'm going to try anyway:

A) **The Coup d'tat on Doran:** This one, believe it or not, is the *least* problematic of the above. As Ellaria's first attempt at revenge did not go well, she likely realized that she would need more support, and that Doran remaining in power would continue to be an fatal obstacle to future attempts. But planning a successful coup of the Prince and his heir and not ending up dead immediately requires more planning than ""stick him with the pointy end""; she needed to turn many more members of the Martell household &amp; guard (and if we're realistic, possibly other Dornish noble houses as well) to her cause. They were already disgruntled, but typically need more encouragement to commit treason against their overlord.

So, she needed to set her plan into motion while still giving herself time to build the support required to successfully kill Doran and Areo. The voyage from Sunspear to KL would take ~ 10+ days by my estimate (average speed of medieval sailing ships were &lt;5 knots, making them fairly slow, and Sunspear to King's Landing is 1/3rd of the continent practically) and add to that the travel time of the Raven bringing the news. Ten days is plenty of time to work on the household and nearby nobility and establish what she needed; and should she fail, she and the 'snakes would still be able to flee Sunspear by the time the news of Myrcella's poisoning came back.

By killing Myrcella, she already gets the satisfaction of killing a Lannister in revenge (and potentially starting a war); not much need then to attempt to kill Jaime &amp; Bronn as doing so would be infinitely more risky as they can actually defend themselves. So leave them be, it's simply not worth it for her.

This also handles the use of poison; Ellaria &amp; Co. had a closing window to take their revenge, but could not risk blowing the greater plan, so they subtly kill her instead and keep Doran in the dark.

B) **Trystane's Assassination:** We know from last episode of season 5 that the two snakes that would end up killing off Try were still on the docks as the ship left the harbor. Yet they show up 10+ days later after said ship entered King's Landing. They had to have gone by sea, as a land journey would take way too long. I also don't think that they intercepted the ship sometime later and stowed away; it would be difficult and would definitely raise the suspicions of Jaime &amp; Bronn considering Myrc is dead at this point. 

If I had to guess, they embarked some hours later, took a smaller/faster ship on a potentially shorter route, and either beat the first ship there, or arrived shortly after. To sail from Sunspear to KL, you must go around the Broken Arm and past the Stepstones, which are notorious for pirates. To do this safely, Jaime's ship would likely hug the coast of the Arm as it passed the Stepstones, cross the Sea of Dorne, and avoid Shipbreaker Bay by sailing to the East of Tarth, hugging the coast the whole way. A more dangerous route would have had the SS's cutting through the middle of the Stepstones and crossing more open waters. While only hypothetical, this is plausible, and would negate the hours-long head start of Jaime's voyage AND eliminate the possibility of the pursuing ship coming within sight of the first. (I may post a map with the hypothetical routes if pressed, if anyone even reads this).

**Bonus Plot Hole:** Assuming I'm on the right track up until now, A &amp; B cause their own additional plot-hole (oh, joy). If the coup was not finalized, then why kill Trystane in KL? 

This hole isn't so bad in actuality; I just thought I should address it. In killing Myrcella, Dorne *will* end up at war with KL. If that were to happen and Doran is still on the throne in Dorne, the potential of having his sole heir taken hostage might move Doran to sue for peace- which we know is exactly what Ellaria and the SSs *don't* want. So they let Trystane make the trip to KL unscathed, and kill him off in a bloody manner. If the two assassins get away clean, they may even get to pin his death on the Lannisters. There would be no excuse for Dran to hold back, and even though the smarter ones in KL might divine that both assassinations were a plot to incite war, they would be powerless to stay Cercei &amp; the Lannisters and their dedication to 'paying their debts'.

C) **Spears &amp; whips in a ship??? Are you fucking kidding me??:** Yeah, there is no functional excuse for this- the only thing that I can come up with is that the show-runners wanted them to use thier normal weapons so we can tell which one is which, since there isn't much else (certainly not their personalities). It's an annoying artifact of the show.

**In conclusion:** Yes it is a mess, and certainly underwhelming compared to the intrigue of the books, but it *is* somewhat explainable. Here's to hoping they don't come and blow this delicate little expaliner of mine to pieces with another episode riddled with plot holes.",7,3,False,self,,,,,

So Cersei is adamant a witch she crossed paths with years and years ago had burdened her with a great curse. Something crossed my mind today after watching S6 E1, if you havent seen it, last chance look away now. 

After seeing Melisandre taking off her choker charm necklace and taking form of an old hag witch, it immediately became apparent to me its entirely plausible she IS the witch from Cersei's past. Did the lord of light curse Cersei, and Melisandre is the one to carry out the Lord of Light's directions to see the curse through?

From the top of my head so far she has; (as far as we know) sought alliance with the remaining Starks, unintentionally or not killed off the remaining few Baratheons (Roberts true heirs to the throne).

Before, Melisandre would take her clothes and necklace off near her potion cabinet but not fully keep focus on her during the scene. Using some TV logic you could assume that it is plausible that she took a potion before she took her necklace off. In the S6E1 scene of her stripping, before she takes her necklace off, the shot focuses in on her potions and one in particular. You can see her looking at the potion, almost in contemplation of whether to take it or not. She decides not to possibly because she feels that she doesn't feel like she knows who she is anymore after ""failing"" to see a vision properly, or she feels that the lord of light doesn't empower her anymore. Either way she decides to see her true form and strips herself of all falsehood, displaying her witchly, old body. As another user pointed out, this stripping down and disbelief in the lord of light is the same point that Thoros of Myr was at just before he resurrected someone he cared deeply about. This could be the point where the lord of light gives her the power to resurrect Jon, potentially lining up with when the wildlings come to defend Jon's body. So, some speculation here, but I think that Jon will be resurrected and kill off the treasoners in the nights watch, then Jon and the wildlings will march on Winterfell and take it over. This will then act as the central stronghold in the war against the white walkers and their army. I believe the northern story line will end with the white walkers breaking through the wall and Jon &amp; Sansa recruiting all of the north (possibly other houses as well) to help defend against the initial attack which will happen in Season 7.

This is literally the one thing standing between success and destruction for the Boltons, and especially for Ramsay. As Roose teasingly points out to Ramsay, if he doesn't have Sansa he's of no use to House Bolton, and Walda's son will essentially replace him, which is his biggest nightmare. So, *everything* rests on getting Sansa back.

So why does he send just 6 men to find her? Literally everything depends on getting her back, if I were Ramsay, or Roose for that matter, I'd be throwing everything I had at finding her, and making sure those who found her would be able to bring her back to Winterfell. Sending just 6 dudes and 2 dogs, in the big, wild North where everyone hates Roose and Ramsay because they're Boltons, but will happily take in or protect Sansa because she's a Stark, seems like taking a bit of a chance, and evidently it was exactly that.

Most characters in the series are only concerned with their own power even if they plan to use that power for good, there's no reason she couldn't be the same. Perhaps, having developed these powers over centuries she saw an opening to make a difference and so she began her work under the guise of a red priestess without ever actually believing anything she said.

Thoros shook her because as far as she was concerned R'hllor was just a fairy tale and therefore couldn't have granted him power. Now she's having a crisis of faith because she's essentially been in Nietzsche's ""will to power"" camp only for all her efforts to fail.

I think this would fit rather perfectly with the rest of her smoke and mirrors act such as [](#s ""Stannis' sword, the illusion she casts on the bone king to make him appear as Mance Rayder in the books,"") and the reveal last night.

He made a pact with the children of the forest, who this character resides with. The magic in that weirwood tree could be keeping him alive.

The reason this episode seemed like us poking out heads through doors and checking everyone is ok, is because of the fucking crazy climax of season 5. So lets roll it back a bit to season 1, the ending was NOT the death of eddard stark (will be important later) it was everyone going ""oh shit"" and it had the birth of dragons which was so awesome and left us hyped. Now we get to the ending of season 2 black water bay was NOT the final episode of the season, we had a bunch of other cool shit though like siege of Winterfell, again some cool stuff to keep you hyped. Season 3 ending Red Wedding was NOT in the final episode, nothing too exciting in this episode. Season 4 final episode, attack on the wall was NOT the in the final episode, we see people dealing with the aftermath. We also had death of Tywin Lannister and destruction of Mance which was pretty cool. OK, now we come to season 5, spot the difference. In the final episode of season 5 this happens: Jon snow dies, Dany gets hordenapped, Marcyella dies, Stannis *dies* (please be alive) plus his army gets rekt, Arya goes blind, Cerci's walk of shame and Sansa &amp; Theon's escape plus death of what's her face (the kennel girl). Then first episode of season 6 we look at the aftermath of at least 4 major plot points. Now if we look at season 1+3 episode 10 dealt with aftermath of the major event, especially season 3 where it started right after the red wedding. Because they did not do this they created a weird very slow episode that did not progress anything to a good extent for example Tyrion and Vareys see the burning ships and literally just say ""we're not getting to Westeroes any time soon"" the CUT to the next scene which I'm pretty sure was catching up with something/someone else.

Just because someone else managed to revive another character in the show multiple times doesn't mean Melisandre is capable of also doing it. For a start she might have no idea of how the process works, she may logistically have no access to the corpse or there may be opposition from the fellas in the room. Maybe she doesn't want to revive Jon... So far most of her exploits have involved people dieing. What's to say this will be different. 

I'm theorising that if some olde theories are correct about Jon's blood line then he'll be burnt at a pyre and his body will come back to life. I'm guessing Bran sees this or he sees Jon's birth in some vision. If Jon's heritage is as we predict then Melisandre's magic will have little to do with it, from my understanding.

Final remark, I hope the theory about Jon snow having a twin sister is real and she's the one the prophecy is referring to. Although it looks unlikely at this point.

The humble squire. The watchful hopefully-eventually- a knight. Why? For one thing I feel like he is one of the only characters with a genuine kind heart. Keep in mind I have not read the books, so I don't know what he is like in the books at all. I mean he saved Tyrion's life at Blackwater. He knows his houses. Tyrion himself said that there has never been a better squire. He's learning combat so he can be a knight. Plus he is apparently a god with the ladies.

My wishful thinking: This is when I talk about my own wishful thinking for Pod based on my own personal bias, and knowledge of what I think I understand about the show. Now that Podrick and Brienne have teamed up with Sansa and Reek, Pod and Sansa will fall for each other and get hitched. The wars will end in a way with Bran having the option to take the thrown, but he will choose to be like his Dad and choose Winterfell over the thrown, there for making Sansa the heir to the thrown, but since she is a woman Podrick will be king.

Yeah it's far fetched and probably won't happen, but Podrick is a G, and needs some love'in.

In honor of the show finally returning, here's a website for an essay I wrote a while back where I used my knowledge of fencing and martial arts to make a tier list for the best swordsmen from the Game of Thrones universe.

Basically, I evaluated the characters solely based on their fight scene choreography - those who used realistic and effective tactics were favored over those who dramatically swung their sword around for no purpose other than putting on a good show. Some of the choices are going to be controversial - I couldn't include a lot of reputably excellent fighters because we never see them fight in the show or we never see them in their prime (I'm looking at you, Selmy).

Let me know what you guys think! Happy to debate and defend my choices within the scope of the rules I laid out on the site.

The Dorne plot actually makes a lot more sense **now** after seeing the new episode.

The overall plot begins with the Lannisters having popular and loved people from Dorne murdered and raped. Despite that, Dorne held back and did nothing, but hatred simmered. We saw that hatred in Oberyn, where it eventually led to his recklessness in his duel with the Mountain. Oberyn was killed, which was seen as another popular person from Dorne that the Lannisters murder, which adds **yet another crime** to the tally for the Lannisters. But again the Dorne reaction is... nothing.

Worse than nothing, they not only keep the peace, but they send Myrcella back home safely as the Lannisters ask, together with Trystane who is to wed her. They plan to put him on the small council and work closely with the Lannisters. They play nice with those the people of Dorne hate.

And the people of Dorne are furious. Ellaria and the Sand Snakes were assumed by many viewers to be outliers, vengeful fools (""it's not what Oberyn would have wanted""), but given the reactions of the guards in S6E1, they appear to reflect popular sentiment; as Ellaria said, Doran is out of touch. His people want **revenge**. ""I've seen war; I don't want that for my people"", he said, but war is what his people want.

So Ellaria and the Snakes decided to stage a coup. They gave Doran every chance to do something, but as they saw him let Myrcella go, they orchestrated her murder, carefully so it happens after they ship disembarks (because they still need time to prepare the takeover). They then sent two of the Snakes after them in another ship (perhaps days after, there is no rush), in order to assassinate Trystane, so there is no heir (why 2? to ensure success). Back in Dorne, they consolidate power secretly, and when the raven's message arrives, they can't hold off any more and kill Doran and those loyal to him - not many people, it turns out.

We are going to see Dorne take arms and go to war against the Lannisters and the Crown, for all the murders and rapes that they committed against Dorne that went unpunished for years on years. **That sounds amazing and I'm looking forward to it.**

Yes, they didn't show us the two Snakes that trailed the ship to King's Landing, nor did they show us how they got onboard. It's not hard to imagine how they did it, so why waste screen time on it? We need that time to show us important things.

One final thing I want to note is how the Dorne plotline has a parallel to the Wall. In both cases, a leader (Jon / Doran) does something clearly right (save Wildlings / not go to war), but the majority are too filled with hate about old crimes (Wilding raids / Lannister's murders and rapes) that they assassinate the unpopular leader. Both at the Wall and in Dorne, we are seeing the worst of humanity.

**edit**: I forgot to mention that the Dorne hatred for the Lannisters was not only fanned by Oberyn's death, but by what Oberyn achieved. As the Mountain killed him, he admitted what he did (""yes, I killed them..""). Dorne suspected the Lannisters were behind those murders and rapes, now they have official confirmation, thanks to Oberyn.",17,26,False,self,,,,,

In regards to Dorne?

I see it in almost every post ep discussion; a highly voted mention that the Dornish arc is now somehow 'ruined' by the fact that Doran and Tristane are now dead. To an uninitiated mid-level lurking observing of r/GameofThrones, there seems to be two reasons: 

1. The guy from ~~Battlestar Galactica~~DS9(sorry. Got my spaceship shows mixed up) is dead
2. Sand Snakes are still alive

Again, to someone who has only read the books a couple times and discusses the show with about 5-10 non-redditors through the average (off)season, I'm not quite clear on what has been ruined in terms of the story. From that perspective, Doran was an introspective man among a hot headed society. The people, rightly or wrongly, have been asking for blood since the rebellion murders and have resented Doran for his inaction ever since. 

The Sand Snakes are petulant little brats who happened to be badasses. The fact that the community hates them for what they constantly call bad acting, is a testament to how good they are actually playing their roles. Have you ever seen a teenager before? They usually roll around thinking they know everything, quoting stupid memes(""bad pussy""), and are more reactionary than they are thoughtful. Ring any bells? Probably not, but if it did, it'd be because you'd recognize that's how kids act.  Throw in a little privilege and you've got yourself a mighty fine reflection on the annoyance that is young adulthood. 

So again, I don't quite know how Dorne going to war has ruined a show about factions going to war. If anything, it seems to have lit a major powder keg that will drive the story forward. Killing Doran is most likely going to bite them in their asses, but I think calling it a show ruiner is a bit reactionary to say it nicely. 

PS - Dead serious when I ask this: Is there some sort of LARPing going on that the average sub browser isn't aware of? If so, my apologies for breaking the fourth wall. The anger regarding the storyline just doesn't seem to match anything real that's happening.

Are the sand snakes going to blame the Lannisters or someone else for the murder of Dorne's ruling family? Everyone here keeps saying that killing Doran and Trystane doesn't make sense. They were Oberyn's family, Oberyn,who everyone in Dorne wants to avenge. It also doesn't make sense that EVERYONE in Dorne was alright with killing Doran in exchange for war. Whoever else in Dorne was against the war might be convinced or further pressured to fight, if the sand snakes can make them believe the murders/assassinations of the Martells were ordered by an outsider. 
OR
Since Doran doesn't leave his home (and his bodyguard him), for now the only death people might know about is Trystane's, which can be pinned on the Lannisters a lot easier than Doran's. 
They could just say Doran's condition worsened and he died, his guard too (of sadness I guess).
Or own up to what they did and take control (with the people of Dorne backing them).
What do you all think? If the sand snakes take control, how are they going to fight the combined force of lannister, tyrell, and baratheon? Playing defense or attack since they all seem to be weak at the moment?

The most logical step would be redoing the steps Aegon The Conqueror did: claiming Dragonstone and launching an invasion just like her ancestor. But now that the Dorne plot diverged significantly from the books, a much easier solution (which will certainly be noted by Tyrion and Varys) appeared: as the daughter of Elia Martell (Oberyn and Doran's sister), Daenerys actually has a very legitimate claim to Sunspear's seat. Add this to the fact that the stepstones provide an easier path to Westeros (even having dragons, she also needs an army and means to transport it accross the sea) and now we know that unless those tacky sand snakes bend the knee to Dany, they will probably be burned by dragonfire.

I'm also getting that the northerners will have to help defend castle black in the future, since they know what's on the other side.

Also, why does Daenerys Targaryen get a pass by the other Dothraki? Does GRRM actually say that there is a no touch law for widows? And then it's implied she will go die in some kind of widow death camp, is this even in the books? Why wasn't this brought up right after Khal Drogo died?

Option 2: Sometime before nightfall, Ed comes with a bunch of wildings and a battle ensues, which will most likely result in the deaths of Thorne and the mutineers (i.e. the vast majority of the Night's Watch).

Option 3: Right at or just before nightfall, right as Thorne is about storm the building and Ed arrives with the wildings, Jon is resurrected. He steps out of the building just as everyone is about to kill eachother, prompting everyone to be shocked, stop fighting, and submit to him; allowing Jon to become the unchallenged leader of the Night's Watch and Wildings, and mobilize his forces to move south to take Winterfell and prepare to confront the white walkers.

So like we all do when the credit of a new Game of Thrones Episode are rolling, i hang back and think about what just happend, what could happen next, casual stuff. So after seeing Prince Doran and his son getting killed, in which i have to say Trystane deserved to die, when he intentionally placed himself between two people, who just said they want to kill him in a very narrow space, was pretty stupid, i thought whats next? Now that everybody in the royal familie is dead, who is in charge of dorne now? Why the fuck where the guards just standing there, seeing their king eh... i mean prince getting killed? Was Doran hated among his people? Do they want to have a war with the crown? I don't know... 





Which kept me going and i realised that this whole escalation could have been stopped back in Season 5 and yes i know this has been talked about back one year ago, but i just thought about it more. 

When Jaime, Myrcella and Trystane started their fun journey to Kings Landing, except Myrcella died like 10 Minutes after they had left, why woudn't they just turn? I seriously want to know! When she died in Jaimes hands why would he just keep going? Did he think she just died by a flu? Maybe he was afraid of going back to die himself? Was it all Dorans Plan? I mean there probably wasn't a maester on board to say it was poison, but do you know who was on the ship? Fucking Trystane was. The guy who genuinely loved her. The son of the Prince of Dorne! So if this all was in fact planned by Doran, he sure as hell woudn't send his only son and heir on the ship with the father (or uncle, don't know what they know) of the girl he killed. And we all here know this, im just trying to think, what jaime was thinking. 


So if i would have been jaime, i would have gone to Trystane and told him and out of his reaction he would have commanded the ship to turn the fuck around immediatly and he would have told his dad, in which he would've killed or at least hunted the quartet of madness, which is Elaria and the Sand Snakes. And Again its not like they where already traveling for some days, which would have been a little bit more understandble, but no they litteraly just started.


So in short: Is there any understandable none bullshitty explanation for why the heck Jaime and Crew didn't just turn around when Myrcella died? ",7,9,False,self,,,,,

I've only watched the first four seasons of Game of Thrones, but I've been spoiled extensively by the books/and by friends, so any gratuitous violence from the fifth season can be mentioned as well.

Essentially, I know she'll love the show, but I want to skip some of the more.... well, unpleasant scenes that might turn her off from it all together. Here's some examples of what I'm talking about:

- Baby killing (Baratheon's heir) scenes in season 1/2 (don't remember which season) 
- The rat-in-a-barrel torture scene in season 2
- Ros' torture scenes with Joffrey and her murder (though this is shown off-screen) 
- Theon's torture scenes at the hands of Ramsay Bolton (the more graphic ones, including where he gets his penis cut off)
- Sansa 'rape' scene in season 5

Her only lines in this episode were:

""Ser Davos.""

and

""I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.""

So, there's still *at least* one more scene with Melisandre and Ser Davos together, so any speculation about whether she's alive or dead can be pretty conclusively shut down. Mel's alive.

Also, I think the notion that she would simply die of old age as soon as she revealed her true self is kind of ridiculous. It's pretty clear that her appearance is the result of a glamour of some sort. It's not as though she's *actually* using magic to make herself young, just using magic to mask her aged appearance.

**Melisandre was able to seduce the most duty-bound man in Westeros**

*""She was known to possess a famous heavy silver necklace""*

**Melisandre's necklace**

*""She was a great reader, even at an early age, spoke many languages, and maintained a large and arcane library. She also was reputed to share her mother Serenei's skill in the dark arts""*

**Shadow baby, the expected resurrection of Jon Snow, Fire-seer, Unnaturally long life**

*""Aegon IV sired Shiera upon the ninth and last of his mistresses, Lady Serenei of Lys, the last daughter of an ancient but impoverished line of Valyrian nobility. Shiera's mother was disliked by Aegon's courtiers and considered cold and haughty; it was rumored that she was much older than the king, practicing dark arts to retain her youth and beauty.""*

**This would explain how Melisandre learned the dark arts in order to extend her lifespan.**

*""...there were rumors that she bathed in the blood of maidens to retain her beauty.""*

**This would explain the bath scene without the necklace, and the potion that she put into her bath**

Some other arguments:

* The connection between Targaryens and fire could easily transition to service as a Priestess of Rh'llor.

* Her relationship with the Bloodraven, the Seer Beyond the Wall. **Ice**. Priestess of Rh'llor. **Fire**. Brynden Rivers the Bloodraven and Shiera Seastar, known as the Melisandre, are *The Song of Ice and Fire*

* Both the Bloodraven and Melisandre appear to be hundreds of year old, which means there is a possibility they are around the same age.

He has the Blood of a Dragon, he killed the Mad King and spilled his Blood over him. Dragon has to have three heads so it has to be a Targaryan. Other Dragons won't do.

He was born amidst Salt and Smoke, Salt is the Sea around Casterly Rock, Smoke comes from the mine from under Casterly Rock (They need smelt the gold ore in gold bars/coins, there has to be smoke. ) .

~~Born under a Bleeding Star (A comet is not a star! ) , means his dead Mother Johanna Lannister who died (Bleeding out.) giving birth to Tyrion Lannister.~~
Marriage is in Westeros a ritual done under the seven pointed Star, a bleeding Star is a damaged Marriage (Also the symbol of faith it literally a bleeding star.) . Also the seven pointed Star is the symbol of faith and thus marriage in westeros. Johanna betraying Tywin with the Mad King. Tyrion is Son of the Mad King and Johanna, he is the Dragons that follows shortly. Jamie broke Tyrion out of his Cell, and made sure he escapes. Tyrion is also instrumental bringing the Dragons back, he is key to the Targaryan Restoration to the throne.

[Seven Pointed Star is literally a bleeding star.](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Seven-Pointed_Star?file=Seven_Pointed_Star.jpg)

Azor Ahai will draw the sword from fire, Jamie has the perfect hand (edited) to do that. People with normal hands cannot do it because they'll burn, but Jamie can wield a burning sword, drawn form fire. The Weapon has not yet appeared, however he will get to do that.

Cersei Lannister is the Love he has to kill, the sacrifice he had to make, he had three kids with her and truly loves her (No just some cheap cave sex like with Ygritte! Danny did not love Drogo either, it was arranged not love. Also Brienne is the bitch to Cleganes Hound, both not a knight but running around with Plate Armour and Swords, and not Jamies romantic interest. ). Thus ending his unhealthy relationship.

DeObia Oparei: I'd love too! I really enjoyed Season 5, but I feel like there's a lot more to Areo Hotah to explore. I understand he was a POV character in the books, and something of a fan favorite!
 
D&amp;D: Oh yes, he's quite beloved by the fans. We've got big plans for him. Would you like to hear them? 

DeObia Oparei: Absolutely! I can hardly wait! 

D&amp;D: Well, you appear right off the bat in Episode 1. Lots of story to cover in Dorne, so we get right to it!

DeObia Oparei: The season premiere! My goodness! Excellent, just excellent! I'm so excited! 

D&amp;D: The scene begins with you standing in the water gardens, watching an approaching Doran and Ellia discussing Oberyn. 

DeObia Oparei: Great, so am I cleaning my ax, or do I greet them, or maybe assist Doran up the steps? 

D&amp;D: No, no, nothing like that. You stand, static, unmoving, in the background, for about a minute and a half, while they talk amongst themselves. 

DeObia Oparei: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Got it. And I don't greet them when they approach? 

D&amp;D: No, no, they ignore completely. No acknowledgment whatsoever. 

DeObia Oparei: Maybe I can grunt? Or cough, clear my throat -

D&amp;D: We want to be clear - you have no lines in this scene. You speaking would change the amount we have to pay you. 

DeObia Oparei: Right... makes sense. Like we discussed last season, I guess...

D&amp;D: That's right! You've got it! Just like Season 5, do absolutely nothing. Channel that! 

DeObia Oparei: I just thought since it's a new year - 

D&amp;D: You just stand there like some sort of statue, or a piece of furniture. That's the direction here. 

DeObia Oparei: Ok, ok. Got it... 

D&amp;D: Don't worry, there will be a lot of extras around, just try to blend in with them. Really, appear as unremarkable as possible. The goal is for no one to even notice your presence. 

DeObia Oparei: I suppose that makes sense. Not much use having a bodyguard if he's flashy and -

D&amp;D: Yes, yes, you've got it! Then, a note arrives! The Princess Myrcella has been murdered! 

DeObia Oparei: Oh, boy. I knew this was coming! Ever since the finale last year, I thought a lot about how Areo would react to this. I think he grew quite close to her. And in the books he had that great heroic moment defending her. Oh man, I know he's going to take this one personal. I can't imagine what he's going to do to get revenge! 

D&amp;D: Well, you know, you can internalize all that, but we're really not gonna focus on your reaction. This scene is about Doran, you understand? 

DeObia Oparei: Sure, sure. That makes sense. But I'm probably shocked to hear it! And concerned for the prince! Do I raise an eyebrow, or drop my jaw...?

D&amp;D: You don't react to the news in any way at all. Much in the same way a lamp, or a couch, would have no reaction. 

DeObia Oparei: OK. Got it. Well, I imagine I immediately offer to locate and secure the prince? 

D&amp;D: Well, now, you might have done that, but there's twist! 

DeObia Oparei: Oh boy! A classic Game of Thrones twist! Do I even want to know?

D&amp;D: (laughter) Well, the twist is, it's a coup. Ellia and the Sand Snakes, you know, they're going all the way. They want control of the city. 

DeObia Oparei: Wow! They make their move then and there! This is really ripe for good drama! You guys are going full blast on Dorne this year, I love it! So, what happens? 

D&amp;D: You get stabbed in the back with a tiny blade and crash to the ground, dead instantly. 

DeObia Oparei: ......

D&amp;D: ...

DeObia Oparei: ....

D&amp;D: Are you OK, DeObia? You look a little woozy? 

DeObia Oparei: Wait, so - 

D&amp;D: You're killed immediately! What a twist! The audience is going to love this. Classic Game of Thrones death. You know, we're kind of known for these sorts of shocking deaths! 

DeObia Oparei: ...... So, I get stabbed, and incapacitated - 

D&amp;D: You get murdered. 

DeObia Oparei: .... Is there a fight scene, or - 

D&amp;D: You get stabbed with a tiny blade and fall over dead, like a big Oak tree. 

DeObia Oparei: Some sort of assassin behind me, or?

D&amp;D: One of the Sand Snakes. 

DeObia Oparei: Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck. 

D&amp;D: Right! What a twist! 

DeObia Oparei: Is it the fierce one, at least? With the spear?

D&amp;D: No, it's the one that's clearly a ninety-pound teenager. 

DeObia Oparei: Oh, fuck.

DeObia Oparei: .....

D&amp;D: We should also mention, all your fellow soldiers and guards whom you've lived and worked with for years watch it happen. Because they hate you, you understand? They were in on it. Because you're weak, and pathetic.

DeObia Oparei: ...... 

D&amp;D: Well, it was a real pleasure working with you! 

DeObia Oparei: Any last words? 

D&amp;D: No, as we said, complete silence. 

DeObia Oparei: Do I at least have a death rattle or something? A moan? 

D&amp;D: You just silently and instantly die.

DeObia Oparei: Do I get to at least use the ax? Even if I don't get a kill, can I just swing it at someone? Once? Please? Please! 

D&amp;D: (laughs) No, I don't think so... No. You just fall over and die.  

DeObia Oparei: But you spent all that time designing it...

D&amp;D: I suppose we could have the guards decapitate you with it, and kick your head around a bit... 

DeObia Oparei: Nevermind.

That part of the world is set up for him to take, since he'd be next in line for succession after Prince Doran. He has a similar bone structure &amp; hair color to both Doran and Oberyn and he's fairly tan. And there really has yet to be any misdirection from Dany's surrounding people, aside from Jorah, thus far. In fact, most of the cloak and dagger aspects of the books have been cast aside which will make them all the more shocking if some characters change at some point soon.

Also, a significant amount of Dorne's storyline in the show has been cut, despite it's potential importance to Dany currently in the books. The Sand Snakes are certainly a great way for her to get a foothold in Westeros when she comes over, but they seem more excited about starting crap with King's Landing as quickly as possible. There needs to be someone or something more to connect the dots and give her a bit of a lead-in to that part of the world [other than Tyrion].",3,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure what the GoT universe considers a witch, but Dany has some sort of non-human powers, therefor witch in my book. The lady that ""treated"" Drogo's wound in season 1 was kin of like a witch right? I don't know what color her eyes were. If someone could help with that, it would be appreciated. First question: what other blue-eyed women do we know about? Right now i count 2 for 2 with blue eyes and being witch-like. If it counts for men, what color eyes are the other people who preach about the lord of light? Sure, this could be some sort of crazy dothraki superstition, but just the conversation the dothraki dudes had about white pussy hair before seeing a naked old woman makes me think that this crazy superstition could be true. Second question: Could the red woman have some sort of connection to the witch that Cersei was talking about. I feel like 2 mentions of ""witches"" wouldn't just be a coincidence, especially after a connection seems to exist about this blue-eyed witch theory. If the red woman were in her true form, she may just be thought of as an old witch.

However there is one thing I do not get. Calling Dave and Dan for bad writers for lines like:  
  
""You need the bad pussy""   
""You greedy bitch""  
  
People has attacked these as cringeworthy and bad writing. However this is something they could totally say, these lines are not **out of character** for them. It is not bad writing when a character says something that the character would and could say. So I'm just wondering if people are being serious when they call lines like this bad writing, or if what they actually mean is that the actors are doing a bad job in the delivery?  
  
Again, I did read the books and I do find the show version of Dorne to be horrendous. But what I do not understand is people attacking lines the actors say as bad writing when their lines are completely in line with what the characters would actually say. I do not hesitate do point out what I don't like about the show but I'm not afraid to say where I think the community is wrong either even for the little things.

Here's what I think the writers failed to understand: there was tremendous POTENTIAL in Dorne. The entire thing wasn't a failure, it set up some interesting characters and motivations. It was just all dragged down by the sand snake plot. So here's what I wanted them to do in S6E1:

The Dorne segment starts as normal. Ellaria is leading Doran up the stairs, everything is happy. Doran is seated and continues talking, but his monologue turns sinister (Fire and blood?) We see Ellaria and the Sand Snake (Tyene?) getting visibly nervous. We understand that Doran now knows what they've done. The tension builds, and finally the women reach for their weapons. Doran screams with rage (showing that the passive man can be ruthless). The guards (who are loyal to Doran) seize Ellaria. Tyene attacks and takes out a few guards, but faces Areo. They get a short fight scene, where we finally see Areo being badass. It ends with his axe in her head. Some final line from Doran (what did I tell you about third chances?) Ellaria is taken away.

Cut to the boat, with Trystane. The two Sand snakes enter (maybe show them following the boat first. Or hell, maybe not have them on the shore in the S5 finale, since we're retconning anyway) Okay, so Trystane prepares to fight when suddenly, Bronn enters! (Yeah, remember that guy?) He throws a quip and they have a fight. He probably kills the whip girl (lol), but spear girl corners him, before Trystane delivers the killing blow from behind (yay irony!) He looks shocked to have killed someone, Bronn quips.

So there. Not perfect by any means, but something i quickly threw together to fix some issues. This quickly eliminates the boring and useless characters, while giving the interesting characters additional depth and motivation. It sets up a plot in kings landing for Trystane and a friendship with Bronn, and also sets up a revenge plot for Doran (through his speech to Ellaria). Ellaria can be kept around in a dungeon, as she could play off Doran pretty well, then maybe later she gets an execution scene.

As I said, I don't know what direction the writers plan to take the sand snakes, but it seems to me like this chain of events would open up a much more interesting direction for the Dorne plot to go. What do you guys think?

She had a little girl burned at the stake, assassinated one of the few people who might have actually made a fair king (Renly), and was prepared to kill Rob, whether she actually had any impact on his death or not. She basically sucks the life out of everyone and hasn't done a single good deed in the entire series.

I think at the very most, *if* she resurects Jon it will only be to reek havoc and have him become an evil lich or something. I've never trusted her and I've only been given reasons to trust her even less over the series. I don't know if she's evil, intentionally sabotaged Stannis for some yet to be revealed reason, or just loves to cause grief for literally everyone regardless of who they are. 

I'm not opposed to the idea that she can be good, or at least do some sort of good deed, I just don't think we have any reason to believe she's good yet.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

In the books the red woman uses a bracelet and a glamour spell to turn mance into the lord of bones, saving him from the fire's, My theory is that this story line will be changed to fit Ed, They'll give Ed a bracelette and use her glamour magic to make him look like Jon, using longclaw and his robes to complete the ruse it'll completly cause thorne and co to brick it and allow him to leave as his service was only til death which is technically over. 

That's who she seen fighting at winterfell and it is a storyline from the books still unused but made me think when they ended s06e01 with that scene.

So I have a lot to say but I will try not ramble too much. Also TL;DR at the end. Let's start with  
**Dorne.** I won't tell you how much I hate what's happening with the Dorne plot line, but it seems they are deviating from the book. Of course TWOW hasn't been released yet but I think if Doran and Trystane die, they will die at different times and in different ways. In the show they are dead and there is no mention of Quentyn. Oberyn is dead and he left no legit heirs. That makes Obara Sand the Princess of Dorne now, probably, since she is eldest illegitimate child of Oberyn. What are the sand snakes going to do? It's hard to say. Leave a comment and tell me what you think. But what we know is they seem to want revenge and maybe war. But who do they hate? Tywin is dead, the mountain is dead(officially), and even the princess is dead. What more do they want? Either they simply want to kill all Lannisters, or they want to take the Iron Throne. This is BS because the Dornish are not conquerors, but the show is different from the books. So maybe they want to be players instead of pawns. 2 sand snakes are in King's Landing already. Do they plan on causing trouble? Trying to kill Tommen and/or Cersei? Other than that, it's hard to try predict what they are going to do. Next let's talk  
**Bran.** He is mentioned in the descriptions of episode 2 and 3. ""Bran trains with the three eyed raven"" and ""Bran meets the past."" So it seems it's the same as in the books. He is learning about his powers and he looks into the past. What does he see? Eddard? Does he learn something new about Jon or some other interesting/important information? We don't know how powerful Bran really is and we don't know his role in the war to come. What we do know is that the first men worshipped the trees and thought they were gods, so we can assume Bran is very powerful. We also know this season will take us farther North than we have been before. And we know Bran has dreamed and looked North. So maybe in the next few episodes we see how strong Bran is and we see what's happening North. Maybe the Walkers are on the way or we see where they are from or learn *something* more about them through Bran. Next  
**Dany.** We know she goes to Vaes Dothrak and that a dragon meets her there. Episode 3 description says ""Dany meets her future."" What does that mean? Maybe the dragon burn the Dothraki and Dany gets on and flies away. But that would be dumb. What would the point of that be? Or maybe it turns out the prophecy of the stallion that mounts the world is about her and she along with her dragon manage to inspire the Dothraki to follow her. The Dothraki follow the strong and she is the blood of the dragon and she *has* a dragon. Will the Dothraki take her to meereen and and sail with her to Westeros? Or before sailing to Westeros they sack and pillage a few cities? Maybe. You might say that the Dothraki don't like ships and they would be bad for Westeros. Sacking and pillaging, raping and enslaving. Well 1stly the Dothraki would follow the stallion who mounts the world and 3 dragons, even if it means going by ship. 2nd, Dany is a pretty shit ruler and the Targaryens are probably the worst thing that ever happened to Westeros. So the Dothraki tearing up the place is no biggie.  The Targaryens always believed they were above men and gods anyway. Maybe I'm totally wrong. Or maybe I'm just wrong about some of the details. Maybe she isn't the Stallion but they follow her anyway. Or maybe the Dosh Khaleen will reveal some other kind of prophecy that will be her future. As for Jorah and daario...just more dick measuring and then they find Dany. Maybe she forgives Jorah or maybe she casts him out again. Maybe she finds out he has the grayscale.  
**Tyrion and Varys.** They know how to rule so I think they are going to restore order to Meereen. Episode 2 ""Tyrion Demands good news but has to make his own."" It's hard to say what that means. Perhaps something to do with the ships being destroyed. But we know he is going to go see the dragons at some point and perhaps release them. Perhaps he will find out something interesting when he meets the dragons. Something along the lines of, he is the son of Joanna Lannister and the Mad King, not Tywin. Or maybe they save that for a future episode. Or maybe that doesn't happen. As for the ships being destroyed and them not going to Westeros any time soon, just remember they can get more ships from Euron Crows eye or from another city. Episode 3 ""Varys finds an answer."" I'm thinking it has to do with Sons of the Harpy. I think that means some order will be restored shortly after. Of course I could be wrong and even more chaos ensues. As for Varys and Aegon, I don't think Aegon will make an appearance in the show. I think he is a fake anyway.  
**Greyjoy.** episode 2 ""Balon Greyjoy entertains other proposals."" What on Earth could that mean? I was thinking that Euron kills Balon and takes the seastone chair. But maybe he comes along and convinces Balon to side for Dany. Or maybe Yara/Asha proposes something. A plan of action. It could be anything. leave a comment and tell me what you think.  
**Sam.** Sam hasn't been mentioned in the episode descriptions and we haven't seen him in a while. I think they will not bother making Sam go to Braavos and meet Arya. I think at some point in the season we will see Sam land on Old Town an learn about the Maesters. Maybe he learns about magic or that the Maesters are evil. I don't really know what will happen with his story line. But I think we will learn more about the Maesters and Sam will end up back at the wall eventually. Or maybe not.  
**King's Landing.** Episode 2 ""Jaime advises Tommen"" and 3 ""Tommen confronts the high Sparrow."" We know that Margaery sees Loras again. So I'm thinking there's a little war between the Faith Militant and the crown. I think we will see what Robert Strong is capable of and the faith will be destroyed. But Cersei isn't going to want to go easy on Margaery and Loras. So maybe there are going to be some more issues between Lannister and Tyrell. It's hard to say who is going to win in the struggle. My money is on Cersei. She is a bad ruler and we know Tommen dies before Cersei. I don't think either of them is dying yet. I think Cersei is going to mess things up even more and cause a war. She will do anything to protect Tommen no matter how stupid. I think she may end up killing Ser Kevan Lannister and Pycelle and maybe killing or imprisoning a few Tyrells. I could be very wrong of course. Food for thought. At some point Jaime is going to head to the Riverlands and be at the head of the Lannister army. At some point I think the Lannisters will be completely crushed, but not yet.  
**Arya.** Episode 3 "" Arya trains to be No One."" That's pretty self explanatory. She learns to fight while blind, she gets her vision back and learns to take on other faces. Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner both played a game of 2 truths, 1 lie. Sophie said Ramsey dies, Lady Stoneheart returns, Arya checks 3 people off her list. Maisie said Arya goes to westeros, Arya is in the trailer more times than people realize because they don't realize it's her, and Arya doesn't cross any names off her list. So which are true? In the trailer the only scene I find interesting is when we see the Freys. So I'm thinking Arya kills Walder Frey. The other names on the list are Beric, Thoros, Cersei, Melisandre, Ilyn Payne and the Mountain. My guess is that she kills Cersei at the end of the season and maybe the mountain. ""No man can withstand him."" But maybe Arya can. Or maybe instead of the Mountain it's Ilyn. I doubt it's Beric and Thoros or Melisandre. Maybe she doesn't actually cross any names off her list. We will find out.  
**Sansa.** I think Lady Stoneheart doesn't return. Episode 2 ""Ramsey Bolton proposes a plan"" episode 3 ""Ramsey gets a gift."" Wondering what happened to the hounds? Before Brienne attacks there are 4 riders, 2 footmen and 2 hounds. In the fight 4 horsemen die and 1 footmen. The other footmen likely escaped with the dogs and told Ramsey that they are heading North. His plan might be to catch them before they get to Castle Black. But Sansa doesn't need to go to Castle black anymore. She has Brienne. She has a few options. Castle black, wherever the Umbers live, the Vale, Riverrun. If she goes to Castle Black, she may be caught by Ramsey on the way. Maybe Sansa or Reek is Ramseys gift. Or she could head to the Umbers and rickon might be there and she tries to rally the North so as to take out the Boltons. Or she could try go to the Vale in hope of finding Littlefinger. Or she heads for Riverrun in hopes of getting them to help her by 1st killing the Freys and then heading North to Winterfell. Maybe on the way she meets Lady Stoneheart. But I don't think so. Maybe she is going to head to Riverrun and Littlefinger finds her. They send Brienne to Riverrun to speak with whoever is there, telling them Sansa is alive and is Warden of the North and Allied with the Vale. The Gift Ramsey receives is Sansa, from Littlefinger. Littlefinger and his men head into Winterfell and in the night, slaughter the Boltons. This post is taking me forever to type out and I still have to talk about Jon. I will say however that I think Sansa is going to be a big player in the game of thrones. She wants revenge against the Boltons, Freys, Lannisters and maybe Karstarks. She has a ""friend"" in Littlefinger too, and she is the heir to Winterfell. So much of the North, Vale and Riverrun is on her side. The only gift Ramsey wants is Sansa, Reek, or something from his father such as the Dreadfort or Winterfell. Or the death of the baby that would be his half brother. But maybe the gift he gets isn't actually something he wants. The Boltons could end up crushing the Vale and Littlefinger, or Littlefinger could take out the Boltons. I doubt it, but maybe Bolton and Littlefinger actually work together and take out the Lannisters. It's hard to say what will happen. I could predict 1 thing but end up being wrong. But I might as well hazard a guess. Brienne goes to Riverrun but without Sansa. Sansa meets with Littlefinger OR is captured by Ramsey. Now let's finally talk about  
**Jon and Melisandre.** Ok so you know that scene that ended s06e01? The 1 where Melisandre is old as balls and she climbs into bed. Some of you are saying that she is giving her life for Jon Snow because only death may pay for life and she is doing what Beric did for Lady Stoneheart. Nope. The only reason you think that is because you want Jon to come back to life. You are simply fooling yourself! That is NOT what happened in that scene. The point of the scene was to show you that she is weak and she is losing her faith. She possibly was trying to commit suicide. I also see some of you are saying that Davos knows how powerful Lady Melisandre is and she will bring him back to life like Thoros of Myr. You may even point out how Thoros had lost his faith before bringing Beric back for the first time, just like how Melisandre has lost her faith now. WRONG AGAIN. You are simply fooling yourselves because you want to believe she is going to bring Jon back to life. At this point you may be pissed off at me. But read to the end. Don't stop now. We know from the trailers that we will see her again, so she isn't dead. We also know wildlings are on the way. 1 possibility is that Jon becomes a wight and rises up and attacks people. I almost wish that would happen just to see all of you cry and I can laugh at you. But that isn't going to happen. Another possibility is they burn him and he is actually dead. Another possibility is that he is a warg and is alive in ghost.  
**Here is what is actually going to happen:** The Night's Watch break down the door to where dead Jon is and where Davos and friends are. THe wildlings arrive and kill some people. Davos wakes up Melisandre and she doesn't die but comes outside. She has no faith in R'hllor and doesn't even try resurrect Jon. They burn Jon's body and have a funeral for him. But R + L = J and so something happens. There is power in kings blood. Something happens that restores Melisandre's faith and builds the faith of the wildlings and remaining brothers of the Watch. What could it be? Jon Snow is Azor Ahai reborn. Jon Snow comes back to life and pulls his sword Longclaw from the fire and stabs his wolf Ghost in the heart. His sword becomes Lightbringer, sword of heroes. We all thought Dany was Azor Ahai reborn. Maybe we were wrong. Or maybe Azor Ahai isn't 1 person, but is 3. Dany, Jon, Tyrion. Or Maybe it's just Jon. Jon is no longer a brother. Jon and the Wildlings march on Winterfell and take out the Boltons. Some of the details of my bold prediction may be wrong. I guess we'll find out.  
So tell me what you think in the comments. I might make another post next week after Episode 2 and Adjust/update my predictions. Thank you for reading. You have no life.

After the reveal in the latest TV episode of Melisandre being incredibly old, it got me to thinking about a few things.
First off, how, if Melisandre's religion and belief are capable of seemingly granting an immortality of sorts (at least to the extent of remaining youthful through some means, in this case a necklace), how is it that a religion of such power would be largely unheard of in Westeros?

If we are to assume that Melisandre is hundreds of years old at this point, why is now the time to suddenly start converting and spreading religious belief in Westeros. What makes this the ideal time to show face and make a move?

Furthermore if worship of the red god is able to resurrect people, I would have really thought that past monarchs, hungry for power and eternal life, would have sought out these means by now, and perhaps converted to that faith already. Surely word would have spread, even if just rumours, of a religion in distant lands that brought with it the power to resurrect and prevent ageing.

I have to wonder what the play is now in the sudden influx of activity from adherent of the Lord of Light... and furthermore I can't help but think they are all being played by some greater power. I don't think R'hllor is a god, as such... but rather a demon, or simply an immensely powerful being that is manipulating events from a safe distance.

When I think of the powers granted to adherents and the methods used to worship, I can't help but feel that there is something incredibly sinister that they are actually worshipping. In Melisandre's case, it is almost like making a deal with the devil - where she does gain eternal youth, but it comes at a cost of essentially being a slave to R'hllor. When her faith started to wonder, when she had doubts and ultimately removed her necklace, this apparent 'eternal youth' was shown to be nothing more than a guise, much like in The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Demanding sacrifices to the fire, blood rituals and the very idea of resurrection - i.e. 'fetching' a soul back from the nether, also leads me strongly into thinking that this is all work that could be achieved by a demon and viewed by many to be divine.

I'm kind of rambling here, so I'll leave it there, but I just think it's extremely interesting to ponder on the truths to what we are actually seeing, and how things can be interpreted. Divine or demonic? Or something else entirely? I'd love to hear more thoughts on this.

Edit: another thought on resurrection - could it be that, in fact, once you're dead you're dead, and what we perceive to be a person brought back to life is nothing more than a demon or other being filling an empty vessel, gaining access to who the person actually was through accessing the brain. It could be a deception, of sorts, as those revived also seem to be wholly dedicated to the Lord of Light and also follow and encourage the teachings of their 'master'.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Just watched the first episode of season 6 and have some thoughts on Melissandre and the revival of Jon Snow. I've not seen it brought up as of yet, so if this is a repeat, my sincerest apologies.

Here we go: **Mel will perform the kiss of life (a la Beric and LSH) to bring Jon back.** Here's my thinking...we saw her for the first time, as she truly is. She has never revealed this to anyone, nor have we ever seen her look at herself as she truly is. Why is that? Why now?

Because she has nothing left to lose or live for. Stannis and his entire family are dead, Jon is gone, she's got no one and nothing left to fight for. She's not a young woman (obviously, yikes); she's old, and tired and broken/beaten down. She took off her rubies, and went to bed like that, because (I think) she's done. The last thing she can do is give herself up (to do right by somebody) to bring back the (seemingly) only person who will fight to keep the darkness (Others) away.

Alleria's plan was half assed, ill conceived and deserved to fail utterly.  Prince Doran was shrewd, in control and inspired fear despite being confined to a wheel chair, and was well ahead of everyone else around him.

How we went from that to Doran being a dottering old fool who is betrayed by all of his guards and people is beyond me.  And what about the rest of the great families of Dorne? Are they seriously going to let Alleria take over and lead them to war with the Lannisters?  I assume that is her end game. 

Even more puzzling was an article whose title claimed that this was all ""liberating"" and shit.  How?  They murdered three innocent people and are about to start a war over which rich person killed the other rich person.  Hardly a case for sisterhood is powerful and solidarity.

We just saw in the season 6 premiere that Melisandre can, in fact, perform some crazy magic. Let's pretend for a moment that her powers are fueled by sacrifices to the fire, and each time a sacrifice is made the necklace is recharged..  Or something. 

Now, what if it was Mel's intent to use Mance Rayder as the sacrificial being to replenish her magic supply, but her plan was thwarted by Jon Snow with an arrow through the heart. Maybe a live sacrifice is necessary, and Jon unknowingly ""ruined"" her ritual. 

Maybe this is why, on Stannis march to winter fell, another sacrifice in shireen is needed to give Mel the magic life force she needs to do her crazy stuff. She just didn't account for the backlash amongst the sellswords.

Im willing to bet she is growing weak and tired and close to death and will use the last of her power to bring Jon back which will probably kill her.

Here's what I thought initially.

While in Cats service, Bri made the oath to protect her daughter, and in return, Cat would not get in the way of her killing Stanis.  (On mobile and can't link the scene).  At the moment where Bri finally catches up to Stannis, she had not fulfilled her oath to Cat.

There was this theory, where Cat is reincarnated as one of the Old gods of the  Forest (or something like that?)

What I'm getting at is that Reincarnated Cat, prevented Stannis' death until Bri can fulfill her end of the deal.

As we know Rickon is supposedly with the Umbers right now, and from the looks of the trailers the Umbers appear to be fighting alongside the Boltons.

Next episode's summary states that Ramsey receives a gift, I believe this gift to be Rickon. Could this be a trade for great jon umber? or perhaps a showing of loyalty to the Bolton cause?

Either way i think that in light of last episodes discussion between Ramsey and Roose about how much of an idiot Ramsey is for loosing the key to the north (Sansa), and the rightful heir to the Iron Islands (Threek), This time he will be much careful with Rickon, who could be the key to sustaining the north. 

I expect Ramsey to do everything in his power to manipulate Rickon, and as we've seen with Rickon's character in season 2 and beyond, he was already very upset with his family because literally every member of it ditched him.

Is this tinfoil? Has this been thought of before? Let me know what you guys think.

So Sansa,

When looking at the books, her arc in the show has mixed in some of the stuff that happened with Jeyne Poole, so this occurred to me this morning on my drive to work.

1. Ep1.S6: Sansa has been saved by Theon, Brienne, and Pod, and will presumably head over to the Wall, to be reunited with Jon Snow.
2. Ep1.S6: Davos sends our boy Dolorous Edd, to go get Tormund and the wildlings, so they can wreck the traitors of the Nights Watch.

3. ADWD: Alys Karstark, while running away from a father and son dou whom she seems to fear, shows up at the wall seeking Jons help. Jon then decides to marry her off to a leader of the wildlings

Theory: Sansa will arrive at the wall, after the Davos &amp; Company eliminate the traitors of the nights watch. Sir Davos, or a revived Jon Snow will then marry off Sansa to Tormund, making the wildlings an official house of the Seven Kingdoms, and rallying the Houses of the North against the Boltons.

Note: i know there are some holes here, like Sansa already being married and all, but everyone hates the Bolton's, and she was forced to marry against her will. I don't think Ramsay has gotten Sansa pregnant anyhow, and Tormund seems to be a well liked character with natural leadership skills.

It's not the first or the last time that the show has deviated from the books, but this seems like a pretty arbitrary change to me, and I worry that it might have stripped away what little dimension they had as characters. We still don't know diddly squat about them--why they're attacking, what their purpose is, what role they played during the long night, where they've been all this time, nothing. I'm not saying that attractive White Walkers would've added anything substantial to their story, but it definitely would've added some level of intrigue or even served to humanize them a bit (because looking somewhat human would be a humanizing thing, right?). I mean, in the show I'm viewing them as little more than high minded zombies/monsters, but their descriptions in the books make me wonder about their history, their culture, etc. Maybe that makes me shallow, and it almost definitely wouldn't have any effect on the story, but I was wondering if anyone else was disappointed by this shift from the source material--especially because it doesn't seem to serve any purpose.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Let's also shelve the troubling potential plot holes that have been introduced in S6E01.  My biggest problem with the Sand Snakes plot as a whole, is the massive disconnect between what the writers want us to feel about them, and what we're actually seeing on screen.  Certainly there's room for different interpretations, and when the show is at it's best, there's moral ambiguity in spades.  Unfortunately, we're currently existing in a place of massive disconnect between what we're meant to think and feel, and the actual majority response.

&amp;nbsp;

Often, I'm happy for authorial intent to largely be divorced from interpretations of the work itself.  It doesn't matter what you wanted to show us, only what you showed us.  Sometimes, though, intent peaks through, and we get hints or even explicit acknowledgment of what the writers and showrunners wanted.  Consider the controversy surrounding Jaime's rape/not rape of Cersei in Season 4.  Based on his narrative and character arcs, it made little sense for Jaime to commit such a heinous act.  Viewers were understandably outraged by what they saw, and the episode's director took to social media with his defense of what he saw to be an emotional and rough sex scene.  The problem was, he never intended to show a rape, because he fundamentally misunderstood what most of us now consider to be sexual assault.  It was a huge black eye for the show.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast-forward to S5 and S6 and we've encountered a similar failure.  The Sand Snakes are portrayed as morally grey, or possibly even anti-heroes.  They're fed up with the treatment of Dorne as a whole, with the murders of Elia and her children, and with the butchery of Oberyn.  They've decided to take matters into their own hands to right these injustices.  The show wants you to be conflicted about then.  To understand their motivations, and empathize with their anger, while not necessarily agreeing with the lengths they'll go to get revenge, nor with their disregard of the long game.  The problem is, we absolutely don't understand their motivations, nor do we empathize with their anger.  They're malicious, selfish, destructive, short-sighted to a comical degree, and they don't seem to understand the actual nature of Oberyn's death in a legitimate duel.  They're pure, mustache-twirling villains.  If the show understood them to be such, the backlash wouldn't be nearly as harsh.  We might still hate the corny dialogue, and hammy acting, but we'd at least hate them within the context of a show that understood where the characters stood.

We've seen over and over again how important the concept of hostages is in Westeros, even (and especially...?) when the war is over (see: Theon Greyjoy AKA: reek AKA: castlejumper.  

I believe that Jaime decided to let Trystane go out of his love for Myrcella. Jaime has spent his entire life pretending that his 3 children were not his own, I can't imagine that was easy for him. Then he finally gets the chance to be honest with Myrcella and not only does she not freak out, she is completely accepting of it and embraces Jaime as her father. Think of the intense relief and joy Jaime must have experienced in that moment, then immediately after he has to watch his daughter die.  

Jaime knew how much Myrcella cared about Trystane and how upset she would have been to learn he was taken hostage by the Lannisters. For this reason Jaime takes a similar road to Ned when confronted with the politically expedient choice, versus the compassionate choice, and decides to let Trystane return to Dorne.

It's probably far fetched but hear me out, I think Jaimes story could have some parrelel to Tyrions.




Starting out, Jaime has shown some smarts by recognising Cersei may be showing signs of instability due to loss of two of her children, her recognition of past prophecies coming true and her recent experience at the hands of the Faith Millitant, by sending word to Doran about a possibility of war could be on the table and that it wasn't safe for Trystane to be in Kings landing. It shows Jaime knows the dangers similar to Tyrion.




see here https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gipxw/s6e1_jaimes_letter_to_doran/




Now speaking Cerseis instability and of the prophecy told to her ignoring the part about her children, she is told she will die at the hand of the Valonqar (little brother) thought to be Tyrion but being the elder of her twin, Jaime he is also considered a possibility. Quite crazy though seeing as they're lovers but maybe Cersei does start to break down becoming more and more unstable until she threatens one thing too far, what? I don't know.




Seeing all of this could spark some repressed? Memories for Jaime, He did have first hand experience with madness afterall cuing scenes we've seen briefly in the trailers (http://imgur.com/a/iEVQk). Finally pushed too far at some point, Jaime kills Cersei.




Now where does he go? Apparently he's in the Riverlands at some point, whilst Podrick and Brienne are also close (http://imgur.com/a/XrMJo). Not wearing his Kings guard armour anymore, maybe not held to his vows ""oathbreaker?"" Could he strike up a partnership with Brienne again? There was quite some respect between them when she wrode off for the Stark girls.




Now the biggest part, like Tyrion going over to another ""ruler"" could we see Jaime join the Starks? Brienne being in service to Sansa and all seems he now has a path to Sansa atleast.




TL;DR Tyrion allies with Daenerys. Jaime allies with Sansa/Starks. Thoughts?

Dogs disappearing would only be a plot hole if in season 1 it was explained that all dogs in this universe NEVER run away and ONLY fight and rip people to shreds.

What you guys are mainly complaining about are simple errors. Continuity errors, visual errors and editing errors. Because of these errors, many things become vague or unexplained. For example, if they had edited a 2 second clip showing the dogs running away from the chaos, it would have made things much more clear.

Not showing how the sand snakes followed and sneaked onto Tristane's boat is the editing, or continuity error(depending on what the exact situation is). It is not a plot hole.

A really good example of a plot hole that was mentioned actually earlier on this subreddit is Cersei mentioning twice about her first child with King Robert that was lost. She then talks to Jaime about the prophecy and how she's going to lose all three of her children, *forgetting that she's actually had a total of 4 children. That is a plot hole since it's *logical to assume a mother would not forget a child that she has had. It's a recent event that contradicts a statement that was made earlier in the series. 

Was this episode poorly edited? Yes. Do some of the characters suck? Yes. COUGH SAND SNAKES COUGH. Are there some unanswered questions due to editing? For sure. Are there plot holes that render the story's plot ruined? Absolutely not.

*Edit: Realized my explanation about the actual plot hole was not clear. 

*Edit 2: A lot of people seem to think that i'm complaining. I did not realize that my post came off that way. I don't really care if people like or dislike the current season(I still love this show).

In the books, the way to get there is with Doran's carefully constructed master plan that would, presumably, eventually create a powerful alliance that would attack the Lannisters. In the show, the way to get there is for Dorne to suffer a militaristic coup, and for the new powers there to rebel (presumably). This is a quicker way of getting to the same place, which is reasonable for the show considering they only have like 30 more episodes maybe. 

The coup itself is actually a reasonable turn of events given the political climate of Dorne. It's suggested, in both the books and the show, that the people of Dorne are unsatisfied with Doran's measured approach to governing, and that Oberyn was much more beloved and inspired much more loyalty. Given this, it's not too much of a stretch for that loyalty to be inherited by Oberyn's widow and daughters, and while it's extreme for this to translate to the palace guards being complicit in their prince's murder, Dorne is in extreme times. 

Where it suffers in the show is that we never actually see how unhappy the Dornish people are, and it skips over too much of the setup for the coup. If we had seen a character other than Ellaria (like a dornish lord) pleading with Doran for action, and if we had seen any of Ellaria's recruiting of the palace guards, or even discussing the greater conspiracy with the Sand Snakes, I think the whole thing would have seemed a lot more fluid and natural.

Basically, while the execution sucks, I think the actual underlying plot is not as bad as everyone here thinks.",8,17,False,self,,,,,

**1.** The story is obviously about the tournament where Rhaeger names Lyanna the Queen of love/beauty instead of his wife (the Martell). I started realizing that I didnt know **if Lyanna had mutual feelings of love towards Rhaegar.**
I always knew that Rhaegar became smitten by Lyanna, and that he ""kidnapped"" her, but I dont know if that was just the story from King Roberts POV or what actually happened. 

**2.** Also, there were some characters that i could decipher that were obvious. If anyone could help me figure out the rest?

- She-wolf/Wolf Maiden: Lyanna Stark

- Dragon Prince: Rhaegar Targaryen 

- Storm Lord: Robert Baratheon

- Quiet Wolf/Younger wolf: Ned Stark

- Knight with Two Towers (A Frey): ???

- Maid with laughing purple eyes: ???

- The White Sword:  Ser Barriston or Jaime???

Think about it...the show is not shy about showing people getting killed off. Why wouldn't they show a major character that just had his daughter burned at the stake NOT getting killed? So what then could the Mannis possibly do? What will his role be?


Glad you asked!


Jon Snow was the 998th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. Safe to say that we will see Lord Alliser Thorne become the 999th LC. Maybe Bri-Bri let Stannis off the hook as long as he made his way up to the wall with the promise to finish him off if he didn't comply? He lost his army, he lost his wife and child, he lost Mel and Davos, he lost everything. He has nothing else going for him. One thing he does have however is the respect of the men at the wall especially after saving their ass at the end of S4. This would make him the 1,000th LC. It's no coincidence that we are introduced to the Lord Commanders when they are at 997 (Mormont). The number is not random at all. Something big is coming at 1K and it will be the Mannis!!!

1. It was clear that the Sand Snakes were terribly written in season 5. Their lines were awful, their scenes were awful. They were over-sexualised. They were a large disappointment for many, including myself. It's well accepted that AFFC was quite a dull book (considering the books that precede and succeed it), but the Sand Snakes were very good and promising characters. This was due to the fact that GRRM, when writing the book, heavily played on the bond that the Sand Snakes feel with their father, Oberyn. He was the militant aspect of Dorne and he wanted all of his daughters to carry that spirit with them. It was promising from the point of view of the storyline that AFFC began [AFFC](#b ""with Sand Snakes confronting Doran and inciting the commonfolk to rebel after the death of Oberyn in Kings Landing"") This only got more promising when at the end of ADWD, it was revealed that [ADWD](#b ""Doran Martell had planned for the Sand Snakes to infiltrate Kings Landing and for Dorne to try and reconnect with the Targaryen family"") So basically, Dorne was a very promising storyline, and the Sand Snakes were a huge part of it. 

2. I found that what happened in episode 1 was very promising, when considering what I've written above. Although the lines were still terrible, the change in attitude is a sign of better things to come. If you consider that [ADWD](#b ""a significant aspect of the Dorne plot withered away when Quentyn died in Meeren, there really is no point in Doran anymore. So his loss isn't *that* shocking, his death is an acceleration of the storyline, in my opinion""). 

3. Dorne becoming more militant is better for the show in its entirety. They are probably the largest region in the show that contains a huge amount of resentment for Kings Landing and the Lannisters (the North and the Riverlands probably larger by size, but they are incredibly splintered and the Boltons still retain some control). So in effect, they are potentially the biggest threat to Kings Landing, due to their size, location and lets not forget, the weather. Much easier to launch an army in the sun. 

4. The Sand Snakes getting violent, rather than getting their boobs out, is only better for the show.",3,9,False,self,,,,,

For me it seems weird that we don't even see them get up from the fall, they are just running like the [jump](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/15/06/29A0A36100000578-3124072-image-a-37_1434346882135.jpg) was no big thing at all. 

Same thing with Daenerys last scene in season 5, the Dothrakis were circling her in some ritual almost? It surely didn't look like they were just taking another slave for their horde.

I would be very surprised if this hasn't come up before, but I'll throw it out there anyhow (and I'll try and keep it simple).

**1.** Arya Stark has her list - a list of people that have wronged/murdered her family/friends. I'm sure this list will continue to grow in light of current (and future) events. *The list is not in the story for no reason.*

**2.** Multiple 'main' characters from the Stark family have died with no justice to their oppressors. Most notable people that are still alive are Cersei, Ser Ilyn, Walder Frey and the Boltons (not all on the list but Arya has been absent).

**3.** Arya is training to become a face changer. *Arya is not taking this training for no reason.*

So my theory is rather obvious if you put two and two together. Arya could come back (face change) as her slain family members and seek revenge. Eddard could be seen in the Capital causing havoc, Robb could be seen at The Twins (the crossing) etc etc. This could expand to John, Lady Stark etc etc.

It gives the slain Stark's a purpose beyond their abrupt deaths.

He was in the black cells; maybe he just got caught. I know the faceless men are super-human and we think they can't make mistakes, but maybe Jaqen did. Maybe he's so far from the house of black and white because he's lost faith in their cause, similar to how Thoros of Myr lost faith in the Red God. 

A faceless man in Westeros for no reason doesn't really makes sense unless he's (all things considered) not a very good faceless man. He talks to Arya about offering up many names to the many-faced god, like it's just something she's allowed to do. He kills a bunch of guards to protect his own life when Arya ""gives a man his own name,"" so Jaqen isn't really quid pro quo like his Black and White counterparts.

I doubt we'll ever see that character again (Black &amp; White Jaqen seems like a different faceless man), but I also doubt that Arya will ever truly become no one. So in a sense, it's cool to think that Arya may gain the abilities of ~~Batman~~ a faceless man and leave the ~~league of shadows~~ house of black and white to roam Westeros with a more relaxed attitude than her teachers, much like Jaqen did (who knows -- maybe he still does).",16,19,False,self,,,,,

I mistook the scene for assuming that the hair was a patriarchal thing whereas it was actually specifying a Baratheon thing! Thanks for clearing up some details I didn't know about!


This is an honest to God question. I haven't read the books, only watched the show. and even then I am not into the nitty gritty theories like other fans but there is something I don't understand. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1wL4PMc4Vo 

That youtube clip shows Eddard Stark reading the book of family lineage and discovers (from what I can understand) that the hair colour of the male is that of the father. Hence Joffrey being a Lannister not a Baratheon. 

So if Jon Snow is R + L = J wouldn't his hair of been white?

This may sound silly but I am genuinely asking for someone to explain it. I am sure a book reader will have a very obvious answer for me! I am looking forward to the answer too cause it's driving me insane, and I feel like it's going to be super obvious when I hear it.

I've just started.

Gwendoline Christie is hilarious, Daniel Portman is great, but Nicolaj really seemed like a he didn't want to be there, like he was becoming irritated by the other two. Major third wheel. Parts of it were very funny (Nicolaj somewhat criticizing the Dorne plotline, forgetting an actresses name, and did he start snoring when it got to a scene with the Night's Watch?), and parts of it were, in my opinion, cringey. He's done great in past commentaries. I wonder if it's the headphone setup because he was clearly speaking louder than the other two and someone from another episode mentioned that the setup felt weird. I forget who.

Dean-Charles Chapman's commentary 2 episodes later was adorably nervous but might been better suited if it were only him and Natalie Dormer (who was brilliant). He couldn't get a word in and rightly so! You had Natalie, the writer of the episode, and the featuring director.

The commentary Jeremy Podeswa (featuring directory), DP Greg Middleton (cinematographer), Iwan Rheon and Michael McElhatton was good!

Now I'm moving onto Maisie Williams and Tom Wlaschiha (with Bryan Cogman) and this one should be great!

I've read numerous comments describing in great detail how brutal they want his death to be for what he did to our Jonny boy. But I have just thought up something that would not only destroy Olly physically, but also emotionally and mentally. I want him to be absolutely broken before he dies. Here's what I hope happens:

Eddy boy brings the wildlings to help out Ser Davos &amp; squad. Alliser Thorne, Olly and co. are standing around, waiting for a response from Davos, without a clue that the wildlings are there. Just like Olly's village when it was raided and pillaged. And then I want it to happen. I want an arrow to appear through Alliser's face while he is mid conversation with Olly. And i want to see Olly's face while it happens. I want to see the wildlings spring out of their hiding spots, and begin massacring all the traitorous bastards in the Nights Watch. Olly will hide, just like he did when his village was destroyed. He will cower somewhere, out of sight, watching as all of his brothers are brutally massacred by the very same people that massacred his village. The people that Lord Commander Snow let through the wall. As the last of Thorne's co. are killed, the wildlings will laugh, and celebrate. So will the viewers. We will enjoy watching Olly have everything and everyone taken away from him. We will watch him lose everything, for the second time, because of the same people. And just when Olly, brought to tears, thinks it is finally all over, and begins to clamber out of his hiding spot, he will hear a deep, menacing growl from behind. As he turns he will see eyes like fire moving out of the shadows. And he will see another pair of eyes emerge to the left of the direwolf. Purple eyes. Olly stares up in horror at the risen Jon Targaryen. The living corpse says one word: ""Ghost."", and watches without a hint of emotion as Olly thrashes and screams like the little bitch he is as his entrails are ripped from his stomach. He is silenced as his windpipe is snatched from his throat. The camera pans away to reveal Olly, and behind him, a sign, reading ""Traitor"".


EDIT: damn this blew up. I'm enjoying the discussion and am surprised at the amount of Olly support! Please note this was an over exaggerated piece in what I think is a very unrealistic scenario. I hold a lot less hatred towards Olly as this post lets off, although I still think he deserves what's coming to him. No hate for Olly's actor, who does a great job with making people hate him, and of course no offence meant to anyone who might feel that way. Lets keep it going",70,66,False,self,,,,,

Bronn has proven time and time again that, while he isn't necessarily the best swordsman in Westeros, he is by far and away one of the smartest, something which can give him an edge more often than not. He's shown himself to be exceptionally good at gauging his opponent's weakness and exploiting it, so personally I believe that, if he did volunteer as Tyrion's champion, it's feasible he might have actually come out on top. I imagine he would have a similar strategy to Oberyn, but with less focus on theatrics...and would actually go for the kill as soon as it was an option.

Varys is conspiring at this point with Mopatis to support someone and overthrow the throne. Based on current Season 5/6 events one would assume they were supporting Dany. So why would he issue the order to have her killed? 

So yes I've read the books and know who he supports in the book. I think when season 1 was being filmed they planned on going with that route, but eventually had to change the storyline. What are your thoughts?",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm wondering which idea you guys think is better?


1.) Jon Snow action figure laying on his back in the middle of a white cake with cherry pie filling syrup surrounding his body with a light dusting of powdered sugar for the snow. (Castle Black) - - This could be relevant in two different ways. One being that he died, so that's kind of the opposite of a birthday. (?) and I might write something like ""Happy opposite of what happened to Jon Snow day"" - - OR it's relevant with the theory that Jon Snow is going to be revived, so revival is a birth, in a sense. I thought this would be neat since this season is pretty focused on Jon Snow.


2.) Cake with a Red Woman figurine laying on it with a drawn out shadow baby coming out. (birth) Pretty straight forward.


3.) White Walker (Night's King) standing in the middle of the cake. Reference to Craster, who would give Night's King his babies when they were born. (birthday. duh)

Now, the Sand Snakes were first (unjustly) motivated by avenging Oberyn. I disagree with them, but atleast from an emotional perspective that makes *some* amount of sense. 

What they now pulled in the show is just dumb, it undermines several characters and the world the show constructed. It might be hard to explain this without repeating buzzwords, so let me attempt some worthwhile criticism here.

First the snakes themselves. They murder innocents, betray their kingdom, ruler and kin, without any remorse or morals accounted for, rather making jokes and cheesy ""villainous"" statements. Even Roose Bolton, Stannis and Tywin Lannister seemed to have a human, morally affected response and more importantly *motivation* to their cold betrayals. Not only do the Sand Snakes do this seemingly just for fun, but by merely laughing off kinslaying, they come off as psychopaths. With Tyene last season, I feel like the showrunners tried making them some kind of anti-heroines, now they have no redeemable qualities at all. They don't strike me as people who want to rule Dorne either, is their motivation power? Why would they want more power, what more power is there for them to have? 

Prince Doran seemed like a great plotter and mastermind in the books, always plotting from behind the scenes, but with a calm and collected pace of planning, not unlike Tywin Lannister. His scenes last season hinted that the same character traits were present in the show, but I guess the writers took the negative feedback concerning Dorne to mean it needed some ""shockers"" in there.
But he and Areo Hotah did some pretty idiotic choices last episode that doesn't seem consistent with their characters. As one of the greatest fighters in westerosi history, Hotah should never have turned his back to a known criminal he arrested mere days ago. Prince Doran should've foreseen the Sand Snake rebellion, especially when he found out Myrcella had been killed. In all likelihood it would've been Ellaria.

Would a masterful strategic mind in a high position really read a secret message like that out loud in front of anyone, let alone Ellaria Sand who just tried to murder the girl? That's an idiotic mistake. Who let known assassins walk around with weapons, not only Ellarias, but the other sisters even got their ""signature weapons"" back. Naturally, as Prince Doran is so lenient on his ""second chances"".

Dorne is the strongest of the seven Kingdoms, its importance is hinted throughtout the seasons, it is the only region that can sustain itself and strike back at the Lannisters, which is why the Lannisters are so eager to form an alliance. Such a strong kingdom brought to heel in such fashion seems like a logical slap to the face.

I get the event, I see what the show is going for, but it just doesn't work, it undermines so much lore and world-building.",1691,3601,False,self,,,,,

So with that said, do you think we'll have an ending that will be satisfying for the most part? Is there even a proper way to end a show based in a world so vast and full of different stories? Will we ever find out what happened to Benjen Stark? I feel like a show that has spent 5 years distancing so many of their characters is going to have a difficult time bringing it all together in 19 episodes.

I personally would not be satisfied without some kind of Stark reunion with the remaining children. At this point, Arya is actively being trained to not be Arya, Bran is training to be some kind of magical tree wizard, and the others are all scattered about in the north. I fear that it's going to end without doing justice to their own character developments (IE: just dropping them for lolhappyending), or they will continue down their own paths and never meet again.

**1st picture**. She says ""Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes"". It is actually possible for Arya to have all those eye colors if she becomes a faceless man, or woman in this case.

We also know that it is possible that Arya comes back to Westeros, maybe to the Riverlands where Nymeria might be. Its not really that close to the North where Melisandre will probably be but it is possible that a twist in the plot might get her there.

**2nd picture**. ""I have seen **myself** walk along the battlements of Winterfell. I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground"". 

Since she never mentioned Stannis being with her we have to assume she isn't wrong, at least not yet.

**3rd picture**. Considering that Jon Snow being resurrected and fighting the Boltons is really obvious, she isn't lying here either. 

**In conclusion** I really like her character and yes she was wrong before with her interpretations but i think she will have a big role to play even after resurrecting Jon and i don't think she will die anytime soon as many people suggest she will.

When Azor Ahai comes into play, which might not be really that far away since the White Walkers are probably gonna pass the wall this or the next season, she will most likely be the one to solve the ""riddle"" to find who the true Azor Ahai is since she is, as of yet the only recurrent servant of the Lord of Light on the show (I know Thoros is one too but he doesn't seem like he will get much more screen time). 

**Do you think this pictures are foreshadowing the future of the show? Or can they be just her misinterpreting again?** ",10,17,False,self,,,,,

I've had a thought, and I don't know if it's been posted before but anyway I wanted to bring it up.


Is it too outlandish to think the dagger carried by Tyene could have been simply been poisoned?
I mean, we've seen with Oberyn that applying poisons to weapons is probably a common thing with the Dornish and she is his daughter after all. Maybe this poison takes effect immediately on the skin and the victim instantly is rendered motionless by it or something?

When plotting to remove and kill Doran, Ellaria and the snakes knew that they had to kill Areo swiftly, as he'd be the one to put up a fight and was dangerous to them.

My coworker hates how we constantly talk about game of thrones, then attempting to make fun of us, asked ""who is the leader of House Bartheon?

This started an interesting and long winded discussion that further infuriated him.

House Baratheon Leadership has changed hands so many times, its interesting to wonder where it will end up.  

Here's how it changed over time.... 
Robert, Then Joffrey, Then Gendry, then (Renly vs stannis), then Stannis, then Tommen.  Technically by name/legitimacy, Tommen is a Baratheon, and he is a king, but in reality, hes not actually Baratheon blood, it would be Gendry.  However, with this considered, neither one is a true Baratheon by name AND blood.  King Robert's fathers name and bloodline has ended, meaning the Baratheons are no longer players in the Game of Thrones.  I found it very strange since Cersei, Margery, and Tommen, three huge characters, are very much alive and all 3 of them ""Baratheons""",23,4,False,self,,,,,

He will be:

* Born under a bleeding star

* Born after a long summer

* Born amidst salt and smoke.

After a bit of thinking with my friend, we have come to the conclusion there is a high chance that the TPTWOP is Jon Snow. This is why:

First off, this doesn't have to refer to an actual birth. As MatPat once said, this can be a rebirth (resurrection). Since Jon Snow is dead, he's fully open to being reborn.

Next, a ""bleeding star"" is basically what happened when the dragons were born. It got me to think though: ""If there's a bleeding star when a dragon is born, then what happens if a dragon *dies*?"" I mean, it's possible. Welcome to Game of Thrones, where everyone dies.

The conditions of material during birth are the tricky part. Here's my theory of what will happen:

Winter comes, dragon dies. Jon Snow's body somehow falls into the hands of the Nights Watch, who give him a proper cremation. However, when the flame reaches him, he springs up with life (or something of the sort). If the R+L=J theory is true, the flame shouldn't harm him, and he will be reborn as Jon T. / Azor Ahai. I have no idea how the salt can come into play.

When I was typing this up, I got another idea. Basically everything happens in exactly the same way, but a dragon doesn't die, and if the R+L=J theory is true, then Jon is basically the dragon being born, and thus meaning his rebirth happens under a dying star.

Please leave some comments or feedback, it's actually my first theory! ",7,2,False,self,,,,,

Someone important. Like Cersei, Jaime, or Davos. Jon died, but he's not really dead.

I just read a theory that the Sand Snakes will probably kill Kevan Lannister and Pycelle, who are dead in the books, but Kevan and Pycelle have nothing going on. They're deaths won't really have an impact. Robb and Catelyn had shit to do when we lost them, so that had a MAJOR impact.

But Stannis? Does anyone remember when he was correcting grammar for the Night's Watch (fewer vs. less)? Or pacing around the library with Sam? Or spending most of the season telling Jon to be important? Scene after scene, Stannis had practically no motivation. The writers were done with that character, so his death wasn't much of a surprise.

Season 4: Joffrey's death was great. Oberyn's was even better. Myranda in season 5? Did you even know her name when her face smashed into the ground? Do you even know who I'm talking about now?

I worry about characters like Pod, who are nice to have around, but who aren't important to any main plot. It'd be sad to see him go, but it wouldn't have a major impact on the story. Varys maybe? It wouldn't make sense for someone so smart to die, but he's not so important the show couldn't do without him. I'm afraid for Davos. He's charismatic as all hell and he could persuade the North to fight the Boltons, but the sad truth is he's replaceable. So are Grey Worm and Missandei.

Guys, **I just want someone to die**. The last major death we saw is about to be reversed!

Some characters are too important to die. Bran, for instance, will be around for at least most of this season. Tyrion, too. Dany. Cersei seems impossible to kill, even though her current story is just an Archer meme (""It's just like the gypsy woman said!"") Jaime....could die. He's headed out to the Riverlands, and Brienne may get orders from Sansa... It's crazy in a show like this that the Lannister three are all still alive. Too many characters feel invincible.

Whatever, I'm ranting. What do you guys think? Who's the next big death? I'm looking for longshots and tinfoil hats, people. Let's make this interesting.

The most logical option, from a storytelling perspective (in the TV series, at least) is for Melisandre to do her thing and for the Red God to bring him back. It's what they've set up with Mel's conversation with Thoros of Myr in Season 3, her recent flight from Stannis's side, and her mounting crisis of faith that, presumably, must be resolved for her to go forward.

The question is - in what episode does Jon's resurrection go down? They can only draw out the Night's Watch storyline for so long, given that we can't just have Jon's body rotting for half a season. The way I see it they have a few options:

* Do it in Episode 2 or 3 and make no secret of the fact that Jon is now alive again

* Do it in Episode 2 or 3, but hide the reveal. Melisandre does *something*, or *something* happens, but we don't see exactly what it is. The reveal of Jon Snow is held off until later in the season (possibly until the arrival of the Wildling army at Winterfell).

* The above two options beg the question - will it be Episode 2 or 3? Home or Oathbreaker? Personally, I think Oathbreaker will be about Jaime, not Jon, because using that kind of language to describe Jon seems...inconsistent. He was described by his enemies at Castle Black as ""traitor"", but not ""oathbreaker"", and even if he were to rise from the dead and declare that he's leaving the Night's Watch to march on Winterfell, he's not *technically* breaking any oaths, since he was released from his oath to the Night's Watch when he died.

* Final option - ignore the Castle Black storyline for a few episodes (I know we'll get some of it this week with ""Home"", but that *could*, conceivably, be it for awhile) and then bring him back late in the season. Again, with his body rotting the clock is ticking, even though it's probably 10 below at Castle Black, so this seems unlikely to me.

Should Jon's oath over because of he has died? Or It doesn't matter, his oath continues as long as he lives and he will become oathbreaker after resurrection?

This is my first ever Reddit post. I'll be posting loads of verbose ASOIAF/GOT theories in the near future, so I'll keep this one as short and sweet as possible.

First off... Does anyone know the correct pronunciation of R'hllor? I've been pronouncing it like Ree-Your and rolling the l's and r's. I imagine that the accent would be somewhat guttural.

I believe that Melisandre is having a bit of an existential crisis and that it started to manifest when Thoros of Myr revealed that he'd been resurrecting Lord Beric Dondarrion from the dead.

Melisandre seemed extremely alarmed by this proclaiming, ""You shouldn't have that kind of power!""

I think that statement could very easily be misinterpreted as meaning something along the lines of:

Such power doesn't exist.
It's impossible for anyone, (in this case, Thoros) to have such power.
Etc. Etc. Etc.

I think it's a little bit more complex than that. I believe that this power is not only rooted in the whole ice and fire mythos, but also in the use of magic and the worshipping of R'hllor. R'hllor and the red priests/priestesses rely heavily on blood magic in their crusade to stop the ""enemy"" of R'hllor, The Great Other. I'll delve deeper into these deities and religious practices another time.

Here are some characteristics and qualities of R'hllor and blood magic, as I see them:

Glamour
Illusion
Light
They deplete the casters life-force, even though these forms of magic are supposedly consumed with life.
They are related to the element of fire.

Here are some characteristics and qualities of The Great Other and the magic that surrounds him/her, as I see them:

Dark
Death
Ice
Necromancy
Raising the dead

Here is what I think Melisandre meant by the statement she made. The keyword here is ""kind"", meaning this type of magic. As devout worshippers and priests/priestesses praying to R'hllor (meaning Melisandre and Thoros specifically), their prayers shouldn't be answered by The Great Other, yet they are and now Melisandre definitely seems to be considering that she's been worshipping a false god. Something similar happened when Melisandre used leeches to literally leech blood out of Gendry and cast the creepy things into flames... Stannis almost like chanted the names of his opponents while he threw the leeches into the fire. Slowly but surely, one by one all of these people start dying (which people dying does tend to happen when the whole entirety of your kingdoms are involved in a full-scale civil war). Still, even so, R'hllor and her/his magic are not supposed to be capable of causing death and necromancy/raising the dead. That's Great Other territory. (And yes, cheesy puns intended).

The dichotomy between these two deities reminds me of that PC adventure-puzzle game, Myst. The gameplay is first person... However, you do kinda sorta encounter two brothers who have been trapped in two separate books. Throughout the game you're trying to figure out which brother is the good guy and which brother is the bad guy and you can free one of them from one of the books. Yet, it turned out in the end that both brothers were cray cray and in fact, if you free one of them you ended up trapped in the book. You were supposed to find and free their father... In the vein of Myst both R'hllor and The Great Other could be good, bad, a cross between the two, and Bob's your uncle.

In the end, it really seems that both are one in the same deity, a trickster.

Howland Reed is the driving force behind the actions of Varys and/or Littlefinger. Both characters have some pretty unclear motivation (sure, Littlefinger seems to be power hungry, so less likely that this applies to him, but even he has glimpses of knowing things from more of a big picture point of view - i.e.. the scene with Sansa in the winterfell crypt).

of the fandom and know reddit has a much wider audience...  
We know GRRM borrowed heavily from history, mythology 
and astronomy when crafting the series.  Well, I discovered 
he borrowed from esoteric new age beliefs like the Age of 
Aquarius also known as the Aquarian Age (AA) and Earth 
religions and has even given winks within the series to some 
new age astrologers and writers!  

AA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius in our 
reality is heralding a Golden Age of Enlightenment after the 
chaos, hatred, greed and materialism of the Piscean age we 
are said to be exiting. Just like in the story, the turmoil of the 
past (Rhaegar's actions, Robert's rebellion, War of 5 King's 
the Others coming and forcing everyone in the world to unite 
in a fight against them) was necessary in the process of 
making way for harmony in a new world filled with love, 
brotherhood, unity and integrity.  Without death there can be 
no rebirth.

which are obviously alarming.  But the greater truth is that 

there is no death without rebirth, no renewal without the 

breaking down of outdated structures and habit patterns.  

Just because the world is so mad and so bad and so 

dangerous it is valid to look at the apocalyptic picture.""

Next I found Astrologer Vera Reid, author of ""Toward 
Aquarius"" who believed that in AA man will take control of 
the earth and realize that they are 'the son of God'. Her 
name is so close to Meera Reed's!  And praying to the old 
gods and the new probably won't stop the Others.  It will be 
up to the three heads of the dragon and the Prince that was 
Promised in my opinion.  Medieval astrologist Robert Zoller predicts that during AA religion, the opiate of the masses during the chaotic and destructive Age of Pisces, will be replaced with a 
system that scorns all faiths and is instead run by powerful 
elites who will use science for military advantages, like for 
instance causing earthquakes and weather manipulation.  
Zoller's name made me think immediately of R'hollor, the 
Children of the Forest and even the Maesters. Themes 
throughout asoiaf are very much in line with Neopagans and 
other Earth religions that believe in Gaia Theory. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis

Neopagan founder of the Church of All Worlds and former 
editor of 'Green Egg' magazine, Oberon Zell Ravenheart, 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_Zell-Ravenheart 
helped found Gaia Theory and says we are all one.   ""It is a 
biological fact that all life on Earth comprises one single 
living organism! Literally we are all ""one"".  The blue whale 
and the redwood tree are not the largest living organism on 
earth; the entire planetary biosphere is."" Like on Planetos, Earth is more than just a home, it's a living system.

cool that GRRM is turning us on to these thought provoking 
theories and has introduced me to their founders and

So sit back and enjoy the ride.

Most people agree that it's not if Jon Snow will come back from the dead but how he will come back or by whose power will bring him back. We have seen Thoros of Myr(red priest for the lord of light) bring back Beric Dondarrion, so we know that particular god has the power to, but I don't think Thoros is anywhere near Jon Snow so he doesn't seem like the best choice. The obvious and most compelling choice is Melisandre because she is a red priestess for the Lord of Light, and she is at Castle Black with Jon Snows body. There are reasons why I have some doubt about her being the one; 1. Why didn't she do it already; 2. Her faith seems to be weakened (which actually might end up being a prerequisite); 3. If we follow Thoros example, it takes love and or desperation to bring someone back.

So if not these two, then who? Samwell Tarly and that's not as crazy as it may seem. Here's some evidence to back this up.  Season 1 episode 7, at 41 minutes 30 seconds, sam says ""I always wanted to be a wizard"" it's not too far off to say some words to the lord of light and make someone live again and be a wizard doing spells and magic. At about 37 minutes into s01e07 Samwell asks to take his Nights Watch vows in the name of the old gods because ""the light of the seven never answered my prayers, perhaps the old gods will"" so he is not loyal to any religion and approaching Jon Snows death he hears Melisandre preach the Lord of Light and I'm sure he's read about it. 

In s01e07 at 48 minutes right after saying their nights watch vows, a man says ""you knelt as boys, now stand as men"" and Jon stands but Samwell has trouble standing, so Jon helps him up. Now if my theory holds, Samwell will help Jon rise as a man, remember what Maester Aemon said ""kill the boy, and let the man be born"". Jon snow is killed as a metaphorical boy and will rise/born with the help of Samwell (saying the words that Thoros of Myr did) as a man.

Thoros of Myr ""I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead, and they were the only words I knew. If Samwell Tarly hears that his best friend Jon Snow is dead and sees his body, in pure desperation he might recite the only thing he's read that can bring someone back from death (or he could be coached by Melisandre). And remember it might take love and or desperation to bring someone back, both things Sam will feel.

The scene that lends my theory the most backing is in season 5 episode 10, Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly [farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpt4Aa1ZzKQ) The scene starts with Jon Snows face coming out from the darkness into the light, which comes from a window and shines onto Jon and Sam (seems like symbolism similar to [here](https://youtu.be/DGiYXk4b-YY?t=1m25s) with the lit candle right as  Sam talks about Jon always coming back). Sam tells Jon he wants to study at the Citadel where he ""can learn about history, strategy, HEALING, and other things"". And I'll end this with Sam telling Jon ""I'll come back"".

I've been thinking of this theory since last season ended and never got around to writing it in full, now I feel I've forgotten some things that back it up. Feel free to back it up with more evidence or tear it to pieces :) Thanks.",30,26,False,self,,,,,

This horn is believed to be able to bring down the wall once blowen. I hope that at the end of episode ten. We get a epilogue showing the Nights Watch up on the wall and down below are the Others and White Walkers. The Night King has the Horn of Winters. He blows it and a section of the wall crumbles.

Arya and Melisandre meet back in Season 3 episode 6. Soon after, Arya flees, Gendry starts his 4 year row session and the Brotherhood aren't seen again. 

The main implication everyone takes away from this scene is that Mel tells Arya, ""We will meet again."" This may be true enough, there are hints Arya will come back to Westeros this season (fingers crossed) and may very well seek out Jon and Sansa, either of whom may be with Mel by that time. 

Furthermore - Melisandre ALSO meets Beric. She is immediately intrigued and looks over his wounds before scolding Thoros with, ""You shouldn't have this power..."" He responds that he wasn't the one who did it, it was the Lord of Light. In The Red Woman we see Melisandre in the same state as Thoros, he is depressed and feels powerless himself, losing his faith in his god until someone kills the man that he believes in. He says he didn't even believe the words when he tried to bring Beric back - he just did it because they were friends. So we know that Melisandre knows that this type of resurrection -does- exist, and the type of situation that it might be used in. But she is unsure of herself and losing her faith, maybe she will try out of desperation to bring back Jon, which I believe sets her up for the same perfect storm as Thoros. 

Last, I believe that this scene has more implications for Arya. As soon as she sees Melisandre she says, ""I don't like that woman,"" to which Anguy replies, ""It's because you're a girl."" Arya seems bewildered, and the viewer is left to believe she's just a silly girl that's being naive. But, when they take Gendry she immediately runs up to Mel and calls her a witch. This scene makes a lot more sense to me with Arya being able to see through Melisandre's glamour. Maybe she is just a great judge of character, but seeing an ancient looking crone riding into her camp might be what is off-settling about the situation to Arya, and it would further explain her bewilderment at Anguy's comment. As far as the witch comment, sure, maybe Arya knows something about the Red God through Thoros and that Mel also worships him - but Arya seems to like the Brotherhood well enough. Mel worshiping Thoros' god shouldn't be the kicker for her. A 400 year old crone that just paid for your best friend puts it in a much different perspective, however.

Specifically the part ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.""

In the book, we had Quentyn Martell who represents the sun. He comes from Westeros and dies over in Essos, fulfilling this part of the prophecy.

In the show we have... no one. People were speculating that Trystane was going to play that part, but that's ruled out with his death. In fact, the entire Martell family line has been extinguished so there doesn't seem to be anyone that can fulfill Dany's prophecy. I can see this being resolved one a few ways:

* The Sandsnakes take up the Martell name being Oberyn's daughters. One of them goes over to Essos where the prophecy essentially gives them an instant death sentence (though what trouble they may accomplish is up for debate.) 

* The prophecy is fulfilled in some other way, some other person or a metaphorical ""sun"" will set in the east.

* The prophecy is completely ignored from here on out. It was just Mirri Maz Duur's final attempt at harming Dany.

But she wasn't, not just because of R=L-J but also because the timing wouldn't work (Jon is roughly the same age as Rob, if Dayne was his mother he would have to be at least a year older right?).  She could have still killed herself in grief for all the above minus losing her son of course.

**Further spoiler warning -- This is based on book knowledge, but it's a theory of how events might occur in the show.** 

This is my current theory on how the show will handle the death/rebirth of Jon Snow. While book readers do not know for certain the fate of Jon Snow, it's pretty obvious that he is coming back. The question is how. This is my theory based on how the show has interpreted the books. It contains things that are NOT book canon.

Theory: While Ser Davos and friends (attempt to) burn Jon Snow's body HBO will do a flashback to the Tower of Joy to explain R+L=J. Dragons don't burn*, and that would be a pretty epic rebirth.

And if a wildling horde (led by Giantsbane!) does attack Castle Black and burn parts of the castle, he'd be born amidst fire and smoke. After revealing R+L=J, Jon would emerge from the fire reborn as a Stark, a Targaryan, and the Prince that was Promised.** (""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."") I'm guessing that in the flashback they will also reveal that Rhaegar and Lyanna fled together and married in secret so that Jon's blood is ""true"". (After living his life as a bastard, it would be pretty funny if the big reveal was that Jon is -- in fact -- a great bastard.)

Remember that Thoros of Myr was only able to resurrect Lord Beric Dondarrion after losing faith in R'hllor. He was surprised it worked. It seems like Melisandre is following that story arc. I wonder if Mel would die, though. Maybe she dies and they somehow get her red amulet into the fire, Jon could emerge with a red ruby crown. Another sign of the Targaryens.

TL;DR - Jon Snow goes into the fire. Show reveals he's both a Stark and a Targaryen. He emerges from the fire with a red ruby crown as a prince and heir to the Iron Throne ready to rock.

*Yes, I know that Targaryens can burn. I said dragons don't burn. The show isn't following book canon. And remember Dany's words from [Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlOopnxMPcQ&amp;t=0m37s).

*Book readers will say that Azor Ahai is supposed to be born of smoke and *salt*. For simplicity's sake, my guess is that they just combine Azor Ahai with the PtwP and don't explain the matching prophecies.",15,14,False,self,,,,,

The hounds are with their handler, the sixth Bolton soldier who also disappeared during the battle.

When we first see the soldiers, there are two on foot with one hound each and four on horseback.  Brienne kills one of the riders immediately and then is knocked off by one of the other riders who falls to her sword when he dismounts to fight her. She then takes out a third rider who becomes trapped under his horse.  The last rider is taken out by Podrick, who is then saved by Reek from one of the guys who was on foot.  That leaves one man and two hounds that likely ran off in the middle of the fight.

I wouldn't be surprised if we see the sixth man return with the hounds to Winterfell.

I have a theory about Jaden H'ghar, and I am sure I am not the first to voice this theory.
I believe that Jaden H'ghar was in Westeros when Arya found him because he was hired to assassinate Jon Arryn. Something obviously went wrong after the poisoning as he was captured for something else (or maybe he allowed himself to be captured for other reasons). But as a member of the greatest assassins guild in the world why else would he be in Westeros other then a job? He wouldbt be taking a vacation.


He HAD to be there to kill someone and with how expensive the guild is to hire there is no explanation other then he was there to kill high born and who else but the Hand of the King would it have been?

The fact they chose not too show an on screen death or body is the first sign. The second would be the fact it goes against Brienne's character to kill an defenseless man, her duty was never revenge, it was to rescue sansa, which she does accomplish.

The biggest reason why stannis is alive however, is because he is alive in the books and will be alive in TWOW. The TV show in season 5 finale was only doing its own version of the pink letter from the books, where stannis is ""believed"" to be killed, where he is infact alive.

Roose says to theon ""I should reward the man who slew stannis"", and ramsey says "" he does not know who killed him"", the truth being they found no body and just assumed he was killed in battle and havent thought the wiser.
We know stannis will survive the march on winterfell in the books, because GRRM confirmed stannis will burn shireen. But that can only happen if he survives the march on winterfell",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Now since I'm caught up on the books, I went to westeros.org looked over the list they have of Melisandre's book prophecies, and they all fall into 3 catagories:

A. 100% happened

B. Hasn't Happened Yet/Inconclusive

C. Happened but she initially misinterpreted them.

Basically what I'm getting at is this, I really don't think the flames lie, Melisandre often just misinterprets them heavily, else she never would have backed Stannis so hard. So I'm wondering, can anyone can recall a specific prophecy of hers that has been unambiguously proven wrong?

The Iron Islanders will go to Bravos and fuck up the place where Arya is learning to be a faceless man (they've cast for Greyjoys). Somehow they'll take her and connect with Dany. Dany will kill the Greyjoys and take their fleet. Arya will join Dany and Tyrion and somehow this will tie into the Dorn war. Like maybe it will be Dany and Dorn vs. Cersei and Jaime.

After that we will have a more focussed story, and a clear power struggle between Dany, Cersei, and maybe Jon Snow's wildling army (who will have brutally annihilated the Boltons).

The religions interest me because I see a number of almost direct parallels to religion in our world.

The Religion of the Lord of Light is very dualistic. At first I thought that this was an equivalent to Christianity or other Abrahamic religions in our world until reading either Book 4 or 5. Now I would say that The Religion of the Lord of Light is far more like Zoroastrianism because of the dueling gods, and the uncertainty as to who will win.

The religion of The 7 is very much like pre-reformation Christianity. I initially thought their religion was more like the Greek Pantheon until books 4 and 5, when a Scepton describes the theology of The 7 as understood by the Scept. There are not actually other gods but rather each of the ""gods"" worshiped are just an aspect or person of god. It is very similar to the our world Christian concept of the trinity.

The religion of the Old Gods seems to be shamanistic with a Celtic/Norse vibe.

The religion of the Dothraki seems to be a very animistic, with a mix of Mongolian and Native American themes.

The religions of Slavers Bay just seem to be a classic scenario of local, pre-islamic, near east deities for every city.

There are two religions however that I cannot find equivalents to in our world. The religion of the Drowned God, and the religion of the Many Faced God.
Does anyone have possible ideas as to what religions these are resembling?",6,4,False,self,,,,,

The app is called: **Map for Game of Thrones**.

Here is a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/H4NF5PC.png 


Besides the interactive Game of Thrones Map we have two cool features available at launch: Characters Info and Episodes Recap.

We feel that Episode Recap is a really useful feature and we wanted to have it ready in time for launch. Here is how it works: press the Episodes buton (it's the top one on the left). After selecting the season &amp; episode, and pressing the Recap button, all the episode's scene locations will be highlighted on the map. By pressing Play you will be able to go through all the scenes of the selected episode. For each scene you will see its location on the map, the characters in that scene, a synopsis and even the full transcript of the scene.

We really strived to have the app ready for release in time for the new season, so at the moment you will be able to recap all episodes from Seasons 1 and 5. We are working hard to deliver the rest of the episodes as quickly as we possibly can. And we have a LOT of fun features we plan to add - so please check the app again from time to time. You'll enjoy lots of really cool updates, I promise.


We have 2 versions of the app, one free and one paid ($1). Both are full featured. The free one has a top banner.

**App Links:**

* [Android Free Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minimapps.gotmap)

* [Android Paid Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minimapps.gotmappro) - *($1 - no ads)*

**Spoilers in the app:**

- Characters Screen: the bio and history are taken from the books, there are no spoilers of what happens throughout the books though.

- Episode Screen: when you select a season/episode - there is a short description of what happens in the selected episode - so be careful if you are not up to date with the TV show.

- Episode Recap: full of spoilers of course :)


I hope you enjoy our app. Thank you!",19,11,False,self,,,,,

Point is, maybe Qyburn isn't actually as gung-ho for Cersei as he presents himself to be.

I believe the crowns refer to the colour of her children's hair and the shrouds refer to the circumstances of their death. The hair obviously comes from her children being born of incest between her and Jaime, but she thinks (in the books at least) that Tyrion is behind her children's murder (the gold possibly refer to his hair or the fact he's a Lannister).

I think the prophecy actually hints to multiple murderers. First, Joffrey is killed at his wedding after Olenna Tyrell laces his wine with 'The Strangler'. The Tyrell sigil being a golden rose of course. Then Myrcella is also poisoned at the hands of Ellaria Sand after returning from the golden sands of Dorne, who's ruling house uses a golden spear as part of their sigil. This is the thinnest part of the theory as Ellaria is actually a bastard and in no way related to the Martells, but it is common knowledge that bastards are not treated differently in Dorne and that Ellaria was Oberyn's paramour. 

Long story short, I think Tommen is going to be killed by the Sand Snakes this season to fulfill the ""gold will be their shrouds"" part of Cersei's prophecy, as well as them getting revenge for Elia and Oberyn and throwing Kings Landing into choas, ready for a Targaryen intervention. The symbolism might even be so strong to reflect the sigil of House Martell: A golden spear piercing a red sun (a Lannister son).",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Maybe melisandre really won't be the one to resurrect Jon.

The final scene in episode 1, in my opinion, showed her losing faith in the lord of light.
Now many seem to think that Jon is going to be brought back in episode 2, or 3 at the latest. But what if davos and the wildlings preserve jons body until it's later in the season? Perhaps until after blood Raven and Bran see what events unfold during the ToJ scene(s)?

Now the majority of this sub(haven't seen any actually proof, please post if you have it) seems to believe that the walkers may be burning down Bloodraven's cave. (the walkers not giving a fuck about the flames scenes in the trailers).

So let's assume that were right. The night king realizes/sees bran via vision and realizes he's a serious threat, so they make their move, the cave may be warded so they cannot come inside, but burning the weirwood tree seems like it would do the job.

Now, Bloodraven is like 130. let's face it, assuming were right, there's no chance hes getting out of that cave. Even if they tried to take him. Winter or white walkers would put an end to that. So this got me thinking. Could it be that Bloodraven sacrifices himself for Jon snow after learning the truth of his parentage?

Bloodraven, one of the great bastards, legitimized son of Aegon the unworthy. Is going to use his kings blood during the cave fire to resurrect who he knows is the last male Targ, Jon Snow. 

So there you have it. If Jon really isn't brought back by Mel within the next two episodes, I believe this is the most likely outcome. 

TLDR; If Mel doesn't resurrect Jon it will be Bloodraven. He'll take advantage of his kingsblood after learning Jon is the rightful heir and last Male targ(from the tower of joy scene) and as the walkers burn down their cave Bloodraven will willingly burn, so Jon can be reborn. Remember, only Death can pay for life.

These are all just guesses with a teeny bits of proof of course, like all theories, tell me what you think and most importantly, tell me why I'm wrong! Thanks boys

EDIT: Hey guys, I should have been more clear in the title. The point i'm trying to get across here isn't that I don't think Mel will be the one to resurrect Jon, but that in the event that Mel is unable to resurrect him, this is simply an alternative method of how his resurrection could happen.

So here's one for your convenience: 



http://i.imgur.com/S8QfKFo.jpg


This image will be used as a reference guide. I'll go down the train and explain each and every passenger, as seen in the image.


###Euron Greyjoy


This one's fairly simply. Commandeering this ~~ship~~ train is of course, Euron Greyjoy. He wears a eyepatch and pirate hat as, in the books, he's a pirate (kind of). He's Theon's uncle, and is a general creep/badass. In the books he sends his brother Victarion to go get Dany for him... He's appearing in S6, so the hype is strong here. Moving on


###Lady ~~Stonehype~~Stoneheart


Previously rumoured to appear in Season 3, 4 and 5, and cockteased by D&amp;D's episode titles for the past three years, Lady Stonehype takes her place on top of  the train. Lady Stoneheart is a resurrected Catelyn, who wreaks havoc and revenge on Freys in the Riverlands. In the books, she crosses paths with Brienne, and demands she go and retrieve Jaime and bring him to her so she can get revenge on him for not returning her children to her, as they had agreed. 


Her appearance is so unlikely that you could probably bet extreme amounts of money on it at your local gambling establishment for terrible odds. So naturally, the hype is high!


### CLEGANEBOWL


GET HYPE. This theory poses the Hound as the gravedigger in AFFC, and states that he will be called upon to fight for the Faith against the Mountain, in a trial by combat to determine Cersei's fate.


If you want confirmation that this is a thing, just google ""Ian McShane"". The actor is supposedly playing Septon Meribald, the man who brings the Hound back to life. McShane has even practically confirmed it himself (probably much to dismay of D&amp;D).


###UnJon


Well, there's kinda no way to show a resurrected Jon, so I just went with this image of him as a white walker or a wight or something. Realistically, he'll probably just be resurrected. I don't need to elaborate here. Some theories think he'll be finished with the Night's Watch (since his watch is over) and continue on south to fight Ramsay and the Boltons at Winterfell.


###Tyrion Targaryen 


Some theories will have you believe Tyrion is actually a secret Targaryen, and will eventually become a dragonrider. For a nice, rational explanation of this possibility, check out this link:

http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/Who_is_Tyrions_father


OR, for an explanation with way more hype, check this one out:

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/30mat2/spoilers_all_ddt_a_neverbeforeseen_theory


Chances of this happening this season (or at all) are pretty low, but this is a hype train and we don't have room for non-believers. 




That's about it! Want me to add anyone or anything to hype train? Comment below! I know I've probably missed a few things. 


I hope that my explanations have somewhat helped the unitiated understand some of the hype. Let me know what you think

A couple of times, actually. It either did or didnt go well, depending on how you look at it. Since then, Ive been trying to find my way out of the emotional and psychological depths and to find reasons to get up in the morning and do more than sit and stare at the wall. George R.R. Martins Song of Ice and Fire has been one of those reasons.

A major part of depression is the relentless criticism of your (perceived) failings, lack of direction, lack of meaning, etc. Its the cynical, sarcastic, forever-displeased reviewer of your self and your actions. Wouldnt it be great to just turn that voice off? Well probably not.

Rejecting the cynical, critical part of yourself can be as damaging as listening to it exclusively; like many people, I tend towards the all-or-nothing approach, but guess what? Those are by definition extremes, and extremes arent a sustainable place to be day in and day out.

As a lot of the self-help lit reminds us, you can only move forwards out of anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues by coming to accept yourself. That doesnt mean accepting the fact you have a penchant for strangling kittens which *will not be denied* but you can accept, at least, the fact theres something weird about all of us, and that it can find a (non-harmful) expression.

Reading is often touted as an escape, and in some ways it is. But at another level it actually brings us much closer to reality: when we read a really good book, we get to hear the voices in other peoples heads; we get to observe how others interact without being caught up in the middle of things ourselves. We get to hang out with kings and queens, beggars and thieves; with people like us and kinds of people we never realised existed. George R.R. Martins remarkable Song of Ice and Fire saga might have dragons in it, but its always been the characters and their struggles, machinations and relationships which have made the series truly compelling.

Reading these books has helped me better understand other people and myself; showing me how theres rarely such a thing as a straightforwardly good or bad person (who can say they thought Jaime was a sympathetic character in book 1? Or that they could even begin to fathom what goes on in the heard of Petyr Baelish?). The pain of telling myself I was a bad person (and even feeling physically sick when trying to say or think I was a good person) was increasingly diluted after entering the minds and hearts of these complex characters. And, when it comes to accepting yourself, theres a genuine depth of wisdom in Tyrions advice to Jon Snow: 'Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you. Easier said than done but it takes us right back to the need for self-acceptance before all else.

And so, instead of turning the critical, cynical part of my personality inwards and attacking myself, or suppressing the sarcastic part of myself that tends to get me into trouble, I recently decided to turn it into something creative: [Misanthrotees](http://misanthrotees.com).

Martin reveals something very important about the world: it is often bitterly harsh and unfair. But if that was all there was to it, itd be impossible to become invested in the story or the characters; even as my own life seemed grey and meaningless, these books were a small flame of hope in the night (which, as we know, is dark and full of terrors). Love, morality, honour, sex, loyalty, revenge These are all things we focus on to give our lives meaning in an uncaring universe. When youre depressed, none of them seem enough to make you care. But George did make me care, and for that Ill always be grateful, and not in the flippant hashtag-happy sense.

Im not sure if laughter is poison to fear, as George writes in 'Game of Thrones', or at least not a fatal poison, but it certainly gives it a kicking. Heres my take: as we stare into the jaws of our own mortality, we might as well go laughing. No ones getting out of this alive, so hey  before we go, lets play. So I made this t-shirt as an expression of that sentiment. It makes me laugh and makes me feel alive. I hope it might do the same for you too. https://misanthrotees.myshopify.com/collections/men/products/game-of-life",19,13,False,self,,,,,

7735,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-4-29,2016,4,29,23,4gzprb,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Episode 3 Speculation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gzprb/everything_episode_3_speculation/,akand_sitra,1461941298,"The Name of the 3rd Episode is called ""Oathbreaker"". Now, what can we deduce from this name?

A) Brienne of Tarth

Brienne's sword which Jaime had given is named ""Oathkeeper"". It is always shown that Brienne is very loyal to those people whom she admires. She was loyal to Catelyn and vowed to protect Sansa Stark and she was loyal to Renly and vowed to take revenge by killing Stannis.

So, this ""Oathkeeper"" can become the ""Oathbreaker"" in two ways -

i) She had not killed Stannis Baratheon at the end of Season 5. So, in this episode Stannis comes back, in time, to thwart a Bolton army or shows up at the Wall, depending on the scenario. Which means that Brienne had spared Stannis' life, thus becoming an Oathbreaker.

ii) Sansa gets to know that Brienne and Jaime are buddies. She has the Lannister sword and it would piss off Sansa that Brienne has a soft spot for the person who has been responsible for her entire family's butchering. So, friction erupts between Sansa and Brienne and she asks her to leave. Thus, breaking the oath to Catelyn. Brienne becomes an oathbreaker if she leaves Sansa's service.

B) Jon Snow

Jon Snow has been bound to his duties as a member of the Night's Watch through his oaths. This may be THE episode where Melisandre resurrents Jon, thus bringing him back from the death. And since only death can relieve him from his NW duties, he gets a ""break from this oaths"", thus making him an ""Oathbreaker"" too.

Episode 3 is where Jon comes back! And in the subsequent episodes, meets Sansa, and since he has no more duty towards the NW, will rally his Wildling Army under Tormund to attack the Boltons at Winterfell. Jon will defeat Roose and Ramsay, and will give Winterfell back to Sansa.

And then returns to the Wall. To meet his original nemesis. The White Walkers.

C) Arya Stark

Arya has been stuck in Braavos for over 1.5 seasons now, and all of us are sick of it. Right after her blind training is completed, she will regain her eye-sight and will become a fully trained assassin. But, she does *not* become ""noone"". She retains her identity as Arya Stark, will regain her trademark sword ""needle"" and will run away from the Temple of Black and White.

After getting the required skill-set, she will break all her ties and ""oaths"" from the Faceless Assassins and will come back to Westeros to fulfill her own agenda. To complete her ""List"".

So, she can be an Oathbreaker too. It is high time she gets a better faster paced plot.",50,14,False,self,,,,,

So, my guesstimate would be this -

Episode 1 - Dany meets the new Khal. He decides to send her to Vaes Dothrak.

Episode 2 - Reach Vaes Dothrak. And watch in awe at the beautiful city.

Episode 3 - Meets the Dosh Khaleen. They strip her(as shown in the trailer), bathe her, do some ritual and make her one of them.

Episode 4 - Jorah and Daario catch up. They will try to escape with Dany. No weapons must be used inside Vaes Dothrak. But they do. And the Dothraki are pissed.

Episode 5 - Dothraki surround these three and are about to attack. Drogon descends upon them, and burns everything. Maybe it will burn the Dosh Khaleen building.

Episode 6 - Dothraki become homeless, they see Dany as the Stallion who Mounts the World. They start worshipping her, and they will follow her and her dragon.

Episode 7 - Dany marches towards Meereen. With her new Army and huge Dragon. And Jorah and Daario. Maybe Jorah leaves/dies at this point due to his greyscale.

Episode 8 - Greyjoys reach Meereen. Make a deal with Tyrion to give them ships. (Meereenese ships were burnt in Episode 1)

Episode 9 - No Dany in this. Maybe an hour-long episode of a Battle. Either at King's Landing or at Winterfell. (Jon Snow vs Ramsay Bolton)

Episode 10 - Dany uses the Greyjoy fleet, and at laaast, sails to Westeros, with Tyrion and Euron. (Scene cut)

Jon Snow moving forward is irrelevant. his parentage, future, none of it matters.  He needs to stay dead.  Take off your blinders and take a minute to openly think about what i'm saying.

A song of ice and fire is the story of Dragons and White walkers.  Not Jon snow... *But if you remove the (g) in song hurr durr*  **What was the Prologue of the show and book 1?  What was the Final Chapter and Scene of book/season 1? White Walkers, Dragons.**  It wasn't a coincidence to name the book its main topics and reveal what they are in first and last chapter.  

Jon being a warg isnt going to come to light in the show, its too late to start.
Jon's desire to rule Winterfell is non-existant.  

So what would he do if resurrected?  Defend the wall? Rally the wildlings and beat the white walkers? no.  They have to lose.  The wall has to fall, otherwise the dragons have no one to fight.  The north will get invaded.  

Jons not retreating to Winterfell.  Jons not going to join Dany and ride a dragon.  Jon is going to die the hero that tried to save the wall, but failed because the Men of the nights watch killed 2 lord commanders in less than 1 year.  His story was to explain how the great wall failed.  Move on.

Nobody will make it. The Others don't need to fight a war to take Westeros. I think they are going to save it by converting everyone into the ""dead.""

The Night's King would be fighting a pointless war if he took his army to Westeros just to kill all the people. Why does he want to do it first of all? GRRM hates war, and thinks it does not solve anything. So it is unlikely that the whole game of thrones will be resolved with the winning of a final 100% justified war against an enemy that is 100% evil.

Westeros is in chaos, and failing fast. There are not enough food and supplies for any house or land to make it through the Long Winter. If the Night's King sat on the other side of the wall for another decade, everybody would die as a result of war or famine or winter in general.

So, I had an idea: Coldhands is a wight who is conscious, in control of his own actions (if you don't think Bloodraven is manipulating him). If Coldhands is really still ""himself,"" this is the premise for the Night's King coming to Westeros. Rather than kill everyone to kill them, he will kill them and bring them back as conscious wights to save Westeros from the winter.

No matter what happens, Night's King comes or not, Westeros can't survive the winter.

But they can if everyone is undead.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I don't think the ""wrong side"" is beyond the wall seeing as how that's where jojen wants to take bran

he calls the surrounders ""enemies""; I think this implies enemies of Jon that are currently taking the actions of one

If so, downvote away.

The nights watch was never going to stop the white walkers from getting over the wall, especially after Jon Snows death.  At the end of the last episode Jon Snows body is unburned, and surrounded by a bunch of Crows.  

Back in the first season the body of a crow came back to life and attempted to kill the Lord Commander, and ever since anybody who has died has been burned, because they will most likely come back to life. At the end of the previous season, the presumed Night King and Jon Snow lock eyes as he casts mass raise dead on all the dead wildlings.  Considering Jon Snow killed a white walker just before, I think the Night King is not only aware of Jon, but has his sights set upon him. Assuming the Night King and the white walkers in general are aware of people dying enough to raise them from the dead even if theyre opposite the wall, it seems logical that as soon as they can, the white walkers will resurrect Jon Snow. 

At the end of the last episode Davos was given the ultimatum that they have until dark to open up. Its clear they wont, so its safe to assume that night will fall, and Jon Snow WILL rise.  The question is whether or not hell be a mindless zombie or something else. 

Being that hes (possibly) Ned Starks son (kings blood), and the last Heir to the throne of winterfell, this might grant him some sort of immunity from becoming a basic wight. Instead, hell rise as either the Prince of the Night, or an ambassador to the White Walkers, still basically being Jon, but twisted like Arthas from Warcraft.  Im guessing the former.  Melisandre was certain that the flames showed her Jon on the throne at Winterfell, and they were right - when he comes back the already weakened Nights watch will fall when he kills em all, being empowered by dark magic, as well as having a Valeryan steel sword, the only one in that room that can kill him. Further, hes possibly the best swordsman in that room, and since White Walkers have the sword-shattering ice weapons, long claw being imbued by both dragon fire and ice he essentially gets god mode. 

After defeating the nights watch and opening the gates again, the white walkers come through, at which point the magic that created the wall is nullified, and the whole thing collapses.  Winter sweeps downwards inexorably and NightJon then goes on to conquer Winterfell. The wall and the Nights watch was destined to fall from the beginning, so that the houses of the south are forced to unite under Danerys and her dragons. 

This happens after the Boltons are driven south while Danerys has gotten to Westerns with the help of Dornish ships, after Tyrion helps broker an alliance with Danerys and Dorne. In return for the ships and fealty Dorne gets their vengeance on the Lannisters who theyve thoroughly pissed off and need the help of the dragons. Danerys eventually sits on the iron throne at which point Samwell, a new Maester, comes to advise her after making contact with Bran via the weirwood trees. Bran tells Sam how to push the white walkers back north to winter fell, and create another wall.  Jon Becomes king of the new north, unable to pass the new wall after the climatic showdown between fire and ice. 

**TL:DR** The Night's Watch will fall thank's to Jon Snow rising from the dead in the next episode, thus allowing the long winter to fall on Westeros.",81,67,False,self,,,,,

 I am MUCH newer to this world of Game of Thrones than many of you seem to be. There is a ALOT you all may know and I haven't dug into all the theories yet.  Still, I labeled this Main Spoilers to free up discussion. I think there is a role to play for Danerys dragons in the fight against the White Walkers. I think eventually her dragons, and the fire they emit, will give mankind the decisive victory over the White Walkers. The episode last year with Jon and the leader of the Walkers proved that there really is no workable countermeasure against this threat (unless mankind was able to make 1000s of copies of the sword that Jon had). Come at me, bro. I would not be surprised if the fire from the dragons could and indeed will kill the White Walkers. By the end of this story, I imagine Danerys will make her way north of the wall and launch an attack against the White Walkers, ending the threat once and for all. Perhaps those kids in the magic tree will help with their fireballs. 

A few considerations:

1. The dragons will have to locate all the White Walkers in order to shut down their *zombiefication* powers
2. They may have devised defenses against airborne attacks (it's possible)
3. Danerys will have to free herself, locate and tame her dragons and finally get over to Westeros 
4. Danerys is consumed with returning to Westeros and ruling traditionally but what will make her change course (head north instead)? A messenger with news of what happened in the north with the White Walkers is extremely unlikely (especially since she is a prisoner). 

TLDR: Danerys and her dragons are the key to all this.",32,0,False,self,,,,,

1. Yes the dragon has three heads
2. All three riders were three deads 
3. All three riders killed their mothers
4. All three riders killed their lovers
5. All three never met their siring men
6. But all three are: Targaryen

One- The theory that the Targaryen flag shows a dragon with three heads suggests Dany, Jon and Tyrion will each ride one of the dragons.

Two- Dany should have died in Drogo's funeral pyre but lived due to her fire immunity, Jon 'always comes back', will be resurrected somehow eg by red woman or funeral pyre or warging, Tyrion should have died at the Blackwater and when he drowned in Valyria and actually take your pick... That man won't die. He'll probably face some kind of fire before getting a dragon and be born of it, too.

Three- Dany killed her mother, Jon killed Lyanna Stark, Tyrion killed Joanna Targaryen all on their way into the world or shortly after (born of blood and fire).

Four- Dany killed Drogo to put him out of his half-life. Jon killed Ygritte by training Ollie and looking starry-eyes at her mid war. Tyrion killed Shay.

I'm not sure if it was deliberate or not, but it's known as the ""Heroic"" symphony and Beethoven wrote it originally dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte, but later changed his mind when he heard Napoleon had declared himself emperor. He wrote it in 1804, and after completing it, he claimed that he was pursuing a ""new way"" of composition, and it is considered one of his first works of true genius.

When Jorah and Dario arrive, so does Drogon, who does not burn the dothraki when they are in a place where they cannot defend themselves. The dothraki will follow Dany for being the rider of the stallion. and she will become Khaleesi. She takes all dothraki and bring them back to Mereen and roots out the harpie.(or) Dany gets a huge khalasar and is greeted by the Greyjoy fleet back at Mereen, who had taken ""care"" of the problem that Dany had in the city. This fits quaithe's prophecy, and the dothraki stallion that mounts the world prophecy. I believe her to be ready to invade westeros. This also fits another of Quaithes predictions of betrayal if Euron is the cause of the Harpie, or gives Mereen back to the masters if they leave rule to Dany until she leaves for westeros.

This means, that they would be on a path of violence, mainly towards the Lannisters. Ellaria has murdered Myrcella, thus making Cersei very angry. Now, **Dorne** will rally it's armies and will **march on King's Landing to attack!**


2. The **Tyrells**, especially Olenna Tyrell is massively pissed off because their heirs Margarey and Loras have been imprisoned by the Faith. And Olenna knows that it was Cersei who is behind it. So, Tyrells, who have a powerful Army will **march towards King's Landing to attack!**


3. **Petyr Baelish** had just gifted the key to the North, Sansa Stark to the Boltons. And Roose Bolton has publicly married off Sansa to Ramsay. Cersei had always wanted to kill Sansa because she thinks that she was instrumental in her son, Joffrey's murder. So, she will be very angry with Littlefinger as he had delivered Sansa to the Boltons, instead to the Iron Throne. For which, Petyr would take precautions. He would rally the **Knights of the Vale** and would be prepared for War. Vale had not taken a part till now and all the warriors are very excited about glory. So, they **might march towards King's Landing to attack!**


4. **Greyjoys**, especially the entry of Euron Greyjoy would change a lot of things. He has a massive dream of conquering the whole of Westeros. But, I don't think they will complicate the plot by bringing in the Dragonbinding horn. Instead, Greyjoy will attack the Blackwater Bay with his ships, to gain the Capital's riches. So, he will rally the Ironborn fleet and will **sail towards King's Landing to attack from the sea.**


5. Blackfish is still alive. He might join up hands with the Brotherhood without Banners, the Sparrows, the Faith Militant, the common people of King's Landing etc., and might stealthily attack the Gold Cloak guards of KL. So, another attack from the inside on King's Landing.


Cersei, Jaime, her *zombie-Mountain* will be surrounded by these five armies from all sides - Dorne from the South, Tyrells from the West, Greyjoys from the East and the Vale from the North. The religions Sparrows, BwB and Blackfish will create chaos from within the City Walls.


A richly satisfying, conforming ending where all the loose threads are tied perfectly and where everything combines for a final showdown.


This would lead to a total annihilation of the internal politics of Westeros, and have a satisfying end to Season 6. (Episode 9 material perhaps?)
