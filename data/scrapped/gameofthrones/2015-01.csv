Jaime went to Tywin to negotiate Tyrion's life in exchange for Jaime quitting the Kingsguard and moving to Custardly Rock and bearing heirs. Tywin agreed almost instantly, and Jaime seems to realize that Tywin foresaw something like this happening in advance. 

Tywin doesn't really care if Tyrion lives. That's important in that he's not actively trying to make sure Tyrion dies like Cersei is. On the other hand, preserving his legacy and continuing the family line is something Tywin is near obsessed with. So much so that he even tried to make it happen through Tyrion when Jaime seemed lost. However, Tyrion is no longer an option to continue the line and Jaime is the last hope. 

What if Jaime had agreed to fight for Tyrion in the trial? Jaime's only concern when Tyrion half-jokingly suggests the possibility is that he isn't physically competent enough to win the fight. But if Jaime had decided to represent Tyrion, surely there is NO possible reason that Tywin would let whoever Jaime's opponent is win the fight. In addition, I doubt even Cersei's hatred for Tyrion would be deep enough to overcome her love for Jaime. Well, actually that might very well be possible. 

But the first point about Tywin is the most important thing. Who here knows well about the lore and rules of trial by combat? Would Jaime have been allowed to represent Tyrion? I don't see any reason that he wouldn't be able to. 

Well...he is a member of the kingsguard so some might say he has an obligation to Joffrey. Or does he? I mean Joffrey is DEAD. If we're going by technical details, he's sworn to serve Tommen atm which doesn't conflict at all with representing Tyrion. Jaime is Tyrion's brother, it would make all the sense for him to represent Tyrion.

What do you guys think?

So Ned was one of 'the most noble' men to ever live in Westeros. He's got the blood of the first men in him and was incredibly connected to the Old Gods. He spent so much time in the Godswood I'm starting to think Ned was a greenseer too. He was able to see through time and across the region and knew everything that was going to happen after his death. This would mean Ned Stark willingly gave his life to start the chain of events which (I assume) will end up providing Westeros with its first ""rightful"" ruler in decades.

Jaime will go to Dorne and replace Areos POV

My question is; is it implied that Shae had been bedding Tywin for a long time, since around his return to KL in S3? And that she had been pretending to love Tyrion like in the book (though she doesnt hide it there of course)

It seemed like a retcon to me when Varys offered Shae riches across the narrow sea if she left Kings Landing and she said ""No I love him too much"" just for her to betray Tyrion anyway. It was a deviation from the book that made me wonder if this Shae's fate will change (kind of like how the lack of Coldhands to save Jojen meant that Jojen died).

It's my first year participating in secret santa as well as the person I matched with. It seemed we had little in common except I love Game of Thrones and everything in the World of Ice and Fire.

She sad she liked candles and I figured it would be easy to print on candles and I could just buy some shit online. I got really hooked on the idea of making a house sigil onto a candle and when I found nothing online, I still wanted to make it happen. I found out you could take tissue paper (or patterned napkins) and melt them into candles with a hair dryer. I ended up taking as much info as I could from her form. Last name from shipping label, 3 cats she mentioned, favorite poet she mentioned as for house words. I then designed the sigil and printed it onto white tissue paper.

I got nervous when she didn't post as received after the shipper marked it as delivered. However, she finally came through and it made me really happy to know she loved it. I've never done any crafts or anything before. As a first try with no error room, I thought it came out a bit sloppy, but she loved it regardless.",4,25,False,self,,,,,

&gt;When winter comes...
You'll hear no lions roar...
No stags grazing the fields...
No roses growing in the meadows...
No snakes in the sand...
The krakens will freeze where they swim...
The flayed men will rot and wither...
No trouts swimming in the river and no falcons flying in the air...
Not even the dragons breath will warm you in your halls.
Only the wolfs howl in the night... Winter is coming.

Or something close to it, anyways. Everyone and anyone on the Internet seems to have commented, blogged, or posted these lines or some variation of it, but I cannot for the life of me find a source on who said it, what book it's in, etc. I know there's a fan song or two with names/lyrics inspired by it, but I'm almost positive it was actually said in the books (not sure about the show) first. I've tried searching through this sub as well as /r/asoiaf to no avail. If anyone could help me out I'd really appreciate it. Thanks! Also, I hope I tagged it right.

I tend to over-do parties, and this one should be no exception. I would like some ideas for the party. I wanted to post this early enough where other people can prosper (and I'll have enough time to buy things).


Ideas:

Decorations:
Set at the Dreadfort
Two planks of wood from Lowe's to try and make a... flaying... thing. I don't have the correct terminology.
Lots of chains and blood 


Food:
(My original ideas)
Salladhor Saandwiches
Dolorous bread and salt
Slaver's Tray (Vegetable tray)
Little Fingers (Chicken fingers)
Vargo Float
Dark wings dark words (Chocolate birds with mean notes attached)
Wildfire (Green punch in a glass bowl)
Bolton Bones (breadsticks shaped like bones)


Things I have blatantly stolen from the internet:
Molten gold crown dip
Pizza is coming
The Hound's Chicken
Dreamwine
Milk of the Poppy
Tart-Garyen
Stick it with the pointy end/ Cheddard Stark (cheese cubes)
Arya Starch potatoes
Hodoritos
Direwolf puppy chow
Sansa's Lemon Cakes
Jamie's Severed Hand
Dothraki Horse Heart
Vodka bears and the maiden fair
The boar that killed Robert Baratheon
Theon's Favorite Toy (Mini wieners)
Onion knight dip
Ned's head cake pops

Games:
Musical Game of Thrones (musical chairs)
Drinking gaaaaames?


I can make posters and whatnot because that's what I do for a job. I would love some DIY ideas or... any ideas. :] Hope you all have a great premiere party!

For the low resolution and no intensive graphics, gameplay and loading shouldn't be as choppy and slow as they are. Aside from that, I found that the story was very enjoyable and I was immediately immersed into the world of Westeros. Back at the house Forrester castle/cabin, the blatantly obvious reference to Shakespeare's Macbeth, Duncan and Malcolm, took me out of the game and made me think back to highschool English class. My final bullet is the whole ""press x to not die"" combat system incorporated into the game. Having to mash the A button really brought me back to playing Paper Mario. Although nostalgic, it's not what I'd like from a game about medieval violence. Aside from these things, I found that the game was a lot of fun to play! Telltale always does a great job at writing awesome stories and giving very thought provoking decisions. 4/5 stars from me and I definitely recommend playing it!",1,0,False,default,,,,,

Okay so in the game the Maester explains that Ethan's grandfather Thorren the Bold seized back a river valley from the Whitehills. Their rival house, apparently they used to have ironwood themselves but cut them all down. This would suggest they are neighbours or otherwise live close to eachother. However apparently the Whitehills are Bolton's bannermen while according to [awioaf](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Forrester) the Forresters are sworn to the Glovers. This makes a lot more sense considering they live in the Wolfswood. How is this possible? I thought bannerman would actually live in the area of their liege lord? 



Whats up with the Sentinel's bracer? I doesn't really have any added value, Ethan already makes is prefence clear by the way he meets Ramsey. Who was the Sentinel when Gregor Forrester was the lord? It's nobody at the red wedding or the Bracer would've been lost. Duncan was named castellan so perhaps he was the Sentinel? He doesn't wear the bracer when you first see him as Gared Tuttle. It's rather weird for a lord to have a ""hand of the king"" and not leave him in charge when the lord is off to war.



I find it hard to believe that Cercei and Tyrion would casually sit together to decide of the fate of the ironwood in the north. Even if the matter was so important for it to be decided at Kings Landing, wouldn't Tywin make the decision? I understand that this is probably another way for Cercei to wage war with Margery but it seems silly that they put such a heavy accent on the ironwood.",15,71,False,self,,,,,

In 5 evening's I've finished ALL of them!! 

WOW!!!

I can't wait until the 4th is released and then the start of the 5th season.

Quick question though, I love reading.

How close to the books do the shows relate as I'm looking to start reading the books soon.

Will they disappoint? or put a new perspective on everything? or are so far removed from the show that it seems a completely different story?

Whatever the answer, I'm hooked and my wife is regretting giving me the gift. lol

The dragon is Aegon VI Targaryen. In the books, Tyrion figures out who he is (or supposed to be). This is part of a meandering plot which mostly serves as a geography and history lesson on the Rhoyne. It does not lend itself to TV adaptation, and I don't believe it will be featured.

At the end of ADWD, Varys pops up to assassinate Kevan Lannister, and in some concise exposition, explains who Aegon is and why Varys believes him the best person to rule.

They like exposition on TV shows, don't they? So include that scene (with whoever is the acting hand or whatever, I don't think Kevan got much attention in the show or is a major character in Season 5). Tells the audience everything they need to know. Leave out Young &amp; Old Griff.

Next scene - ship with a silver haired young man in Targ. armour at the bow, and then a tightly choreographed 5 minute action scene showing a professional fighting force breaching a castle efficiently. That'll finish the season on a buzz.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

The physics of fighting, however, seem to obey the rules of ours. 

As such, I find it difficult to buy that Tyrion successfully fought off a stream of enemy troops in the fight against Stannis. When he lands in the water and loses his horse, he still either kills his enemies or they run from him. 

Tyrion is described as a misshapen, hobbled dwarf. I'm sure that he has quite a bit of skill with weapons (assumed because Tyrion seems to be reading far more often than he is out practicing with swords and axes). Nonetheless, size differences matter when it comes to fighting. Especially given that his enemies probably had *some* degree of experience with weapons. I know many of them were injured, but they couldn't all be wounded to the degree that they were incapable of fighting. 

Did you believe it was a realistic description of battle (chapter that starts on pg 852 from Tyrion's point of view)? Or did you struggle believing it?",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I might be wrong, but seeing as The Iron Bank has wealth beyond measure, it would make sense for them to use Sellswords to take what is owed. One of the biggest sellsword companies is The Golden Company. It fields 10.000 men. According to http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armies the Iron Throne should be able to muster somewhere around 352.000 soldiers, that is 35.2 Golden Companies. Wouldn't The Iron Throne and all of its vassals have the power to possibly defy The Iron Bank?

It is explained that this is why there are so many rumors of Beric's death, and Thoros mentions that all red priests can do this.
Second, note that in A Dance with Dragons Melisandre, a red priestess, begins to have chapters from her perspective. This signifies a major role for her to play in the future.

* Avoid spoiling anything major (Season 1 is probably fair game though)

* Be balanced, both in terms of not being overloaded with just action scenes and touching on as many storylines as possible

* Have appropriate background music

Here is, in my opinion, the best official trailer for the show: [Seven Devils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I93RFzrPQqw) - dialogue matches up well with footage, fair bit of action, establishing shots of the landscape, character close-ups, and a few power shots like Stannis burning the idols and Tywin riding into Harrenhal.

Varys: Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands where he killed five of our soldiers.

Tywin: What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?

Varys: 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.

According to [the awoiaf wiki](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Currency), the currency exchange is 210 silver stags for a single golden dragon. Baelish boasts earlier in the show that 100 golden dragons can buy 12 barrels of dornish wine. Assuming a westerosi barrel is the same measured unit as a real world barrel, 12 barrels hold ~1400 litres (depending on which barrel measure you use), which means 14 litres for 1 golden dragon, divide by 210 stags and multiply with the 10 stags in Varys' ""generous bounty"" and whoever kills the hound can afford 6,6 dl, or ~4 glasses of wine. While this is probably extremely exclusive wine it's one of the only times we get to hear a price on anything that I can recall.

I tried finding prices of Westerosi whores to compare to, but the only thing I could find was ""a virgin whore's maidenhead can cost a golden dragon"", which means the person who would kill the hound wouldn't even be 5% on the way to that.

In season 1, for Ned's tourney, the best archer should be awarded 20 000 golden dragons, the equivelant of killing 420 000 Sandor Clegane's.

I know Tywin increases it to 100 stags, but this seems like an extremely low amount of money to go up against one of the most dangerous men in the country. Is the currency list wrong? Blunder on the show's side? Any book info?",11,8,False,self,,,,,

I know it has been said that they will not be in season 5, so I'm not sure why Leaf and the Three Eyed Raven are still included.

2) True to Game of Thrones fashion, [episode 9](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3866826/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast) of season 5 looks like a real kicker!

3) Other posts have pointed out the casting of a young Cersei, but seemed to assume it would be for one or two episodes doing a short scene with Maggy the Frog, but according to the cast list on IMDB, she plays the part for at least three ([1](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3658014/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast))([2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4077554/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast))([3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131606/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast)) episodes in season 6. Is this part of a more extensive flashback, or just the same sequence drawn out? (see Bran &amp; the Three Eyed Raven in season 1) Either way, could this be indicative of a change in pace or content?

Now we all know that at the end of A Dance with Dragons he gets stabbed by his Sworn Brothers of the Night's Watch. But I gotta tell you, there is no way he's dead. No. Way.
How? Clues from the books. First, let's go back one or two books, to Beric's outlaws in the hollow hill. The Hound defeats Beric, killing him, but Thoros, the red priest, brings him back to life. It is explained that this is why there are so many rumors of Beric's death, and Thoros mentions that all red priests can do this.
Second, note that in A Dance with Dragons Melisandre, a red priestess, begins to have chapters from her perspective. This signifies a major role for her to play in the future.
My theory is simple: Melisandre brings Jon Snow back to life.",55,4,False,self,,,,,

I've been seeing a lot of people bring this up lately and people responding that Eddard was injured, or that the Mountain/Jeremy would have destroyed him. But then it occurred to me that perhaps it would have made no sense for Eddard to have demanded trial by combat. Trial by combat, if I recall correctly, relies on the premise that the Warrior (correct me if I'm wrong) grants strength to those innocent so that they may win the fight and prove themselves not guilty. Eddard, on the other hand, still abides by the Old Gods (despite his wife having brought her Seven with her). So for Eddard to have requested trial by combat, he would be betraying his faith and perhaps principle (although I suppose you can argue he abandoned or put aside his principles when he made the deal with Cersei to plead guilty - thoughts?). I know the topic is often put out jokingly but I thought this small and trivial factor justifies Eddard not having requested trial by combat. 

Disclaimer here is that it's been a couple years since I read the books so correct if I'm wrong in any of my premises (or in all of them in their entirety). And I do apologize if I've brought up a already discussed a resolved topic XD ",38,28,False,self,,,,,

However, I have been debating whether or not I should try and rush through AFFC and ADWD before season 5 starts, and put priority over the books, or wait to receive the story from the show, and then read the next two books. My hesitation is that all I have been reading for a while is ASOIAF, and have put a lot of other books I am interested off to the side, and maybe now is the time to read those. Also, I have always first experienced the plot through the show, and then read the books. Although, I know the show is taking some major liberties with the plot this time around.

However, I love going onto the ASOIAF subreddit and reading and talking about it, and I almost feel like I am missing out, despite a lot of people placing the latter two books as their least favorites of the five.

and the bit there tyrion is really hung over as the others are going hunting, and he said 'if i make it through today with out squirting from one end or the other, it will be a success' he couldn't stop laughing for quite a bit.

and he already dislike Jeoffrey, end of 2nd episode. said 'ohh hes a little c*nt isnt he'

its weird knowing what gonna happen before he does, so looking forward to the golden crown to see his reaction to that.

Then I got curios about which are the places with most deaths in ASOIAF so far. But i couldn't find anything on Internet.
So, with a little free time and the ASOIAF wiki, I made a list with the death counting of every place that had a confirmed death. (I haven't considered deaths we don't know the place it happened, or if it happened). Only characters with known names were considered (Soldier number 54 was not considered in the Battle of Blackwater Bay).

Deaths before the start of the ASOIAF story weren't considered (like Rhaegar's)

Unnecessary to say this is major spoiler for anyone who hasn't finished all the books.

622,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-1-13,2015,1,13,13,2s8x01,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers] Season 5 - Casting &amp; cut storylines?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2s8x01/all_spoilers_season_5_casting_cut_storylines/,WoobidyWoo,1421123390,"I've been looking over the casting news that we've had already, and trying to identify which storylines from AFFC and ADWD are likely to be cut/delayed. Since the books run pretty much simulteneously, and Yezzan has been confirmed it's clear at least some material from ADWD will be part of season 5.

The major players in Dorne have been cast; Doran, Trystane, Arianne, the Sand Snakes and Areo Hotah. The High Sparrow and Septa Unella have also been cast, and there have been leaked shots from the pennance walk, so Cersei's story in the books should be up to date by the end of the season.

Jon's storyline at the wall will most likely be worked through to the end of ADWD, if the season starts with his appointment to LC then there's just enough time to get from there to the betrayal in ten episodes.

Leaked set photos have confirmed that there are scenes at the fighting pits in Mereen, so Dany's story will also probably reach it's book conclusion.

Now for everything ""in danger"":

* Michelle Fairley seems to have confirmed we won't be seeing Lady Stoneheart because of time constraints, though obviously this could be a mislead.

* Nothing so far about Griff/Young Griff or Penny, and Tyrion has been seen in Mereen. This could mean they're severely streamlining his passage across Essos, possibly jumping from Ilyrio -&gt; Jorah -&gt; Yezzan.

* No Iron Islands casting. I think this would be the worst story thread to lose, since the Kingsmoot and subsequent lead-up to the battle of Slaver's bay was one of my favourite parts of the last two books. Balon's brothers are all excellent characters, giving more of an insight into the Iron Island way of life than Theon or Yara/Asha. Speaking of, I found that Asha only grew into a great character after the disastrous Kingsmoot, it'd be a shame to lose that from the show but with no casting for Aeron, Euron and Victarion it looks like it's not on the cards this season.

* No casting for Quentyn and pals. Since Dany's arc will likely be pretty heavy with Hizdar, the Yunkai'i and from the looks of leaked set pics, Tyrion, so it may be they've simply cut Quent to simplify things a little in Mereen. 

* The Battle of Winterfell, Jaime's negotiations at Riverrun and Sam's journey to Oldtown via Bravos don't really require any new major casting, so I don't see any reason to think they're under threat of being cut.

Let me know what you think, or if I've missed anything out. It could be that a lot of these roles are simply being kept under wraps, but it seems strange to me that several significant chunks of story with major new characters haven't been publicly cast at all yet.",19,2,False,self,,,,,

The card game tournament is over relatively early, but I hope some of the players will stick around for a game of what I feel is Diplomacy 2.0. 

Yes, I love 'A Song of Ice and Fire', but I love the board game even more. If you haven't tried it; please give it a try! It's such a brilliant mix of strategy, backstabbing, plotting and a hint of luck. The perfect illustration of what the books are like. I've become pretty good at explaining the game, but I'm wondering what I could do to make it the best Game of Thrones night ever. Within my exceptionally limited budget of course. 

So far I have this in mind:

- players are encouraged to bring a friend or two so that they're guaranteed to get to play (games will be supplied by the store)
- we'll play background music from the show of course
- I'll photoshop winners onto the Iron Throne and announce their victory on facebook and on the store tv display 
- snacks and drinks will be served, of course - preferably in goblets
- if I can make the lighting medieval, I will

Anything I should do additionally?

Hey everyone!  Im a mod over at [Iron Throne RP](http://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP) a text-based roleplay based in the Song of Ice and Fire universe!  If you ever wanted to play as a character in GRRMs universe then this place is perfect for you!  

We launched a few months ago, and are developing into a [very strong community](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/) with a [very interesting, player-driven plot!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/2qbr0v/welcome_to_iron_throne_rp/)  We are looking for players to join in on the fun and help develop the plot!  So far, the realm is on the eve of war after the death of Queen Daenerys and disputes over who her heir should be.  A Grand Council is called to determine this, but nearly ends in bloodshed with no resolution.  In the aftermath, a King has arisen in the Iron Islands and another has risen and fallen in the Westerlands.  The North is on the brink of a civil war and the Reach and Stormlands are facing their own internal conflicts.  A full scale war could blow up at any time.  What happens next is up to the players but one thing is for certain;  When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.  There is no middle ground.

There are plenty of characters and major houses available, so if you are interested please hop on over to our IRC and community sub to get acquainted and have any questions answered!  We like dynamic characters so the limit in character creation is your imagination!  Check out [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/comments/2npu0q/character_creation/) to create a character and click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/comments/2pc92r/npcs_and_abandoned_pcs/) or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/comments/2pcfwl/classifieds/) to get a feel for what types of characters are available!

You can find us over at /r/IronThroneRP and /r/ITRPcommunity and in our [IRC Chatroom](http://irc.lc/darkmyst/IronThroneRP/IronThroneRP_@@@) 

Thanks everyone!

I know this is probably really old news for a lot of you, but I just found that out.

DS9 was one of the shows that got me going through highschool and college. Well, the show was well over by the time I went to either, but it was still an incredible experience.

Siddig portrayed Bashir on DS9 in such a fantastic way, especially towards the latter half of the show when the war started. I have to say that he is by far one of my favorite characters on that show (along with Garak), and I can't wait to see Siddig perform again. 

The way he does that relaxed laid back attitude of someone who's much more intelligent (DS9 tiny spoiler, Dr. Bashir was genetically engineered) is a perfect fit from what I understand Doran Martell's character is. I think that's one of the most fantastic castings in GoT so far! Some of the sweetest moments I've had in this show weren't the violent ones, but the way some characters have managed to out-maneuver others by sheer intelligence. And though mostly it's been from people I find hard to root for, I think Doran is going to be one of the players of the game who I'll enjoy watching a lot.

After all this time, I may actually consider changing my flare when his time to perform on screen comes about. I wish I hadn't read about it so early, because I can't wait to see him on the screen again. This is going to be one hell of a good season!

    ""Chaos isn't a pit.
    Chaos is a ladder.
    Many who try to climb it fail
    and never get to try again.
    The fall breaks them.
    And some are given
    a chance to climb,
    but they refuse.

    They cling to the realm
    or the gods
    or love.
    Illusions.

    Only the ladder is real.
    The climb is all there is""

Granted, Littlefinger's ""Chaos"" speech is from the show, and missing from the books, but it's undeniable that it's consistent with his character in the book also.

Those who are familiar with Nietzsche know one of the main themes in his philosophy is the absence of absolutes, and his insistence in the sole reality of the *Will to Power*.  Petyr Baelish seems to have taken a leaf out of Nietzsche's notebook, and this quote of his is pure Nietzsche.   Interestingly, here is what Nietzsche himself has to say in *Thus Spake Zarathustra*:


&gt; Zarathustra however spake thus:

&gt; Ye despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard? And now do I know also where he is to be sought, whom I have sought for in vain to-day: THE HIGHER MAN:

&gt; In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man! But why do I wonder! Have not I myself allured him to me by honey-offerings and artful lure-calls of my happiness?

&gt;  [...]

&gt; This is mine empire and my dominion: that which is mine, however, shall this evening and tonight be yours. Mine animals shall serve you: let my cave be your resting-place!

&gt; At house and home with me shall no one despair: in my purlieus do I protect every one from his wild beasts. And that is the first thing which I offer you: security!

&gt; The second thing, however, is my **little finger**. And when ye have THAT, then take the whole hand also, yea, and the heart with it! Welcome here, welcome to you, my guests!""

&gt; Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mischief.""


(note the bold)

Possibly a coincidence, but wouldn't be surprised if GRRM dabbled a bit with Nietzsche's works.

That is to say, I (being the loser that I am) Have created a list of all 10 episodes of season 5, including all the major events I believe to happen in them.  Basically, this is my detailed guess of how the season will go in its entirety.  So this will literally cover all spoilers from the portion of the books the show has not yet covered.  So even if you know what is to come, if you still really hate intense speculation on how the show will go from here than avoid this post.

Also, I know some of this may be cut but with the way I have this I could see it going this way.  In the biggest example of this, even though there's a good chance Stoneheart has been cut, the way this plan for season 5 would go, even if she is the only part of my outline that would change would be the end of Brienne's story.

Anyway, maybe I packed too much into certain episodes, but this is obviously just guesswork as to how they'll do this season.  Here goes, lemme know what you think (even if it's telling me I'm insanely wrong).

EPISODE ONE:
Arya arrives at Braavos and finds House of Black and White.  Cersei discovers Tywins death and begins Paranoia; sends Jaime to Dorne.  Jon meets with Stannis about Winterfell and thinks over offer, as Samwell plans to make Jon Snow Lord Commander with Aemon.  Tyrion arrives in Essos, Varys tells him he will take him to Illyrio/Aegon/Daenerys/something.  Daenerys visits dragons and hears of first Harpy attacks.  In Dorne, Sand Snakes are introduced and plotting to crown Myrcella begins.

EPISODE TWO:  
Set up for Lord Commander election at Nights Watch.  Cersei begins conflict with Margary/Tyrells and has first flashbacks (full prophecy not revealed yet).  Theon/Boltons arrive in Winterfell, still burned and destroyed. Brienne recovers from wounds and talks to Podrick about losing Arya.  Arya passes test by Faceless Man/Jaquen(?).  Sansa talks with Littlefinger/SweetRobin and they deart for tour of the Vale.

EPISODE THREE: 
Jon is elected Lord Commander, Stannis witnesses this and is turned down by Jon.  Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne.  Roose announces Marriage of Ramsay to fake Arya.  Cersei continues to plot against Tyrells and announces she will burn down Tower of the Hand.  Talk begins of Qyburns experiments and screaming heard.  During his travels, Tyrion finds a brothel and is taken prisoner by Jorah.  Daenerys continues to lose control of Meereen, and refuses to open Daznaks pit.  Hizdahr offers to wed Daenerys so she will be accepted, and to stop the Harpy attacks.

EPISODE FOUR:
During tour of the Vale, Littlefinger reveals to Sansa his plans to give her rule of not only the vale but Winterfell itself.  Brienne and Podrick decide to look for Sansa.  Cersei burns Tower of the Hand and meets with Kevan Lannister.  Jaime meets with Doran and is told no action will be taken for Oberyns death, and while they will not return Myrcella they will ensure her safety.  Sand Snakes become further angered by Dorans lack of hostility.  Arya begins her training with the Faceless Men, and throws away possessions (except Needle).  Daenerys agrees to marry Hizdahr and has a fight with Daario.  Jorah and Tyrion make way for Meereen.

EPISODE FIVE:
Ramsay Marries Arya and torments Theon further.  After a little more time in Dorne, Jaime decides to leave and return to Kings Landing.  Sand Snakes begin to set plans with Myrcella in motion.  Daenerys, continuing to want the acceptance of Meereen, allows fighting pits to re-open.  Brienne and Littlefinger meet, somehow Brienne cannot take Sansa from him (if they do not meet, expect a lot more filler for both of them).  Arya kills someone without consent of Faceless Men.  Jon allows wildings through wall, Mance is burned.  Tyrion and Jorah talk about the dragons.  Experimentation on Mountain is shown.

EPISODE SIX:
Tyrion and Jorah are taken by Slavers.  Jon executes Janos Slynt for disobedience, and begins talking to Stannis about taking the North.  Daario causes some violent scene in anger of approaching wedding for Daenerys, and Dany reprimands him and no longer talks to him.  Arya tells the faceless men that nobody killed the person who is dead, and she awakens blind.  Theon begins to remember himself in Winterfell, and first killing happens.  Cersei has more flashbacks.  Restores the faith to power.  Plots to frame Margary.

EPISODE SEVEN:
Stannis learns what is going on with Winterfell, and decides that a hold on the North is his best way to the Iron throne, so he sets off for Winterfell and maybe sends Davos on mission (if this is kept at all maybe straight to Rickon instead of Manderlys).  Melisandre takes an interest in Jon, who finds out Mance is alive. Cerseis plans backfire and is arrested, and the Faith continues to gain power.  Tyrion and Jorah are sold in Meereen.  Arya has first wolf dreams and improves in training (maybe even wargs into cat).  Theon breaks down and spills his guts in Gods wood, maybe some hinting at Bran here; Theon meets hooded man and killings continue.  Short scene with Podrick and Brienne.  Jaime returns to Kings landing and learns of Cerseis infidelity; she sends him away again, to Riverrun.

EPISODE EIGHT:
Reports/Sightings of White Walker attacks close to the wall.  Plot to crown Myrcella is violently uncovered and Sand Snakes are arrested.  Daenerys marries Hizdahr and attacks have stopped.  Fighting pits soon to be opened.  Tyrion and Jorah are to compete at the grand opening of Daznaks pit.  Arya regains her sight due to vast improvement with Faceless Men and begins losing identity.  Brienne and Podrick are captured by the Brotherhood without Banners.  Jon Snow organizes groups to try to deal with White Walkers.

EPISODE NINE:
Cersei has her walk of shame.  Arya gets first assignment to kill and preforms it with poisoned coin.  At Daznaks pit Daenerys saves Tyrion and lets him sit with her as a gesture.  After chaos breaks out Drogon appears and Daenerys rides him away from Meereen.  The shows slightly different version of the Pink Letter arrives at Castle Black, distracting Jon Snow from everything.  Melisandre sees something in the fire and says something cryptic along the lines of snow

EPISODE TEN: 
Cersei sends letter to Jaime when she learns of trial by combat, but Qyburn informs her that Ser Robert Strong is ready.  Daenerys has a vision of Quaithe in the desert about finding her true self.  Doran releases Sand Snakes but tells them he has been plotting against the throne all along, and reveals Aegon.  Brienne, captured by the Brotherhood, discovers the existence of Stoneheart.  Arya advances with Faceless Men, and appears to have fully lost Arya Stark.  Theon escapes Winterfell and saves Arya.  Maybe even arrives at Stannis camp.  Sansa gets the scene she mentioned that is shocking, which will include foreshadowing for TWOW (if it isnt straight up TWOW content).  The Dothraki find Daenerys in the desert with Drogon.  Kevan Lannister is killed by Varys who reveals his plots.  Jaime, who has arrived in Riverrun, burns Cerseis letter. Jon Snow announces his plan to ride for Winterfell and gains support of Wildings, but the watch stabs him.

P.S. Sorry for any typing/grammar mistakes, I am extremely tired and about to pass out as I finish this so I can't go over this as much as I'd like xD

In season 1, Ned realises that the Lannisters killed John Arryn because he figured out that Joffrey + his siblings are Jamie + Cersai's children (not legitimate Baratheons.)

It makes sense why they killed him, to keep their secret.


However, in season 4 it's revealed that Littlefinger and Lysa actually killed John Arryn, knowing it would look like the Lannisters are guilty.

My question is this, was it pure coincidence that John Arryn had figured out the Lannisters secret before Littlefinger killed him? Because it was the perfect motive for killers being the Lannisters. Did Littlefinger know he had figured it out and therefore knew Ned would be sure it was them? ",6,8,False,self,,,,,

A few of us had already watched/read the books, but my coworker who really wanted to come was completely new to the series. We discussed a little how much she cared about spoilers or dedicating time to watch on her own before we started and she made it clear that she didn't care at all, she just wanted to watch the show starting in the second season. We agreed that it would be impossible for her to get into the plot whatsoever without a primer, so she agreed to have me spoil Season 1 for her (:().

I discussed only Kings' Landing politics, since she's a sharp girl and it's hard to dance around three plotlines and could catch on to Jon and Dany easily enough in Season 2. However, I felt it important to do a little background so I went over Robert's Rebellion. The second I got to the Tower of Joy, she was immediately incredulous. 

""So when Ned rescues his sister, the Kingsguard is there...""

""Kingsguard?"" 

""They're the king's bodyguards, obviously. Check the name."" 

""Is the king there?""

""No.""

""The prince isn't there? Who's there?""

""Just them and Lyanna. So Ned and his crew fight them and they get to Lyanna and she's dying - ""

""Why's she dying?""

""She's just dying, it doesn't say, but it's really sad, and now she's dead and Ned just goes home and buries her because it's just how life goes sometimes.""

""Why'd she die? She's in a tower just dying? That doesn't make sense. I mean she was with the Prince before, so was she like, pregnant or something?""

""We just know what Ned says, she just dies.""

""Come on, she totally died during childbirth. Chicks don't just go around dying alone in towers. Why were the king's bodyguards there guarding just her?""

""I dunno man, all we know is Ned's memory, so anyway, back to the story...""

I was already miffed that she was jumping to conclusions and so I didn't even go over all the kids in Winterfell (only Bran, Arya, and Sansa as they relate to the progression of King's Landing plots.) I definitely didn't mention the bed of blood or the promise, because I didn't want her to have the satisfaction. I finished the story of the rebellion and fast-forwarded us to the real plot.

Once we started watching the show and drinking yesterday, I just listened as she asked our other friends clarifying questions. ""Who's that?"" ""Robb Stark, Ned's oldest son."" ""Who's that?"" ""Jon Snow, Ned's bastard."" ""He wouldn't have a bastard. Who's his mom?"" ""Some chick he met during the war."" ""BULLSHIT, he wouldn't do that. We don't know who it is, seriously? And he was born during the war? It's totally his sister, Lyanna or whatever.""

Suddenly, it clicked into place for the show watchers as I all ignored them fully and went to get more wine. So, long story short, everyone had a theory spoiled for them by someone with a cursory knowledge of Westerosi history and fifteen minutes of show-watching experience under her belt.

As far as fantasy novels go, this one is unique. First off, in most fantasy, medieval stories there are other species like elves and orcs. Humans are mostly portrayed as just another short lived race. Instead of taking the simple route of making his world diverse by putting in extra species, he just kept the focus on the humans. We as a species are fascinating, we invented agriculture and mechanical engineering and almost anything you can think of. Geroge Martin understood this and made all these great inventions created by humans. We are also very diverse as a species. Some people have black skin, others have white, oriental eyes, blue eyes, curly hair, and so many other features. Instead of having an ""elf kingdom"" and a ""human kingdom"" he just made dozens of human kingdoms. 

Everyone is so culturally diverse and have such rich histories. How the North men moved across a land bridge, the Andals took over and the only people left who speak the old tongue live up north. All these different religions that believe in different gods and the languages diversity. And don't even get me started on the architecture. Each city has its own unique look based on the inhabitants and the history. Meeren has those pyramids built by slaves,  the Eryrie built on top of two mountains, or Pyke built on the coastlines of the iron islands. Everything area is just so rich in culture and history, there is always so much to learn by reading the wikia. 

And finally the characters. The characters have such good back-stories and how they are all connected in some way. Samwell Tarly is the second cousin of Shireen Baratheon. Those two side characters are related and you wouldn't even think of that unless you looked at their family tree. Individual characters too seem very realistic. No one is portrayed as a great hero who can never do wrong. Rob and Ned stark can be ruthless at times. And the villains are some over the top bad guy with an evil mustache. George Martin shows the true evils of man of them just doing what evil people do. The villains in this world such as Gregor Clegane, Joffery Baratheon, and Ramsay Snow do what normal villains do in this world. They aren't trying to plunge the world in a 1000 years of darkness, they are rapers, they abuse their power, they murder and torture innocent people. These are what real villains do. And George RR Martin betrayed everything well. ",5,20,False,self,,,,,

/r/IceandFirePowers is a Game of Thrones strategy game that started recently, and adds more stuff to do all the time. The game's also evolved a lot since I've joined by adding cool interactive maps, new mechanics and a bunch of other stuff. There's a lot of Lore and Intrigue if you're into that, but there's also the option to war with the other kingdoms. (maybe pull a Castamere)


There's a decent amount of active users and the game allows you to be as involved or hands-off as you want; make alliances and go to war or sit back and tell a story, whatever you want to do.
Come check it out, the IRC chat is linked on the sidebar. Also feel free to comment on this post with any other similar games.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

Why do I post on Reddit?  Everyone's first reaction is to assume, judge, and belittle.

I don't shelter my kids.  I understand it's different from when I was 12.  I use judgement when letting them watch our play stuff that is considered mature.  I'm aware of the violence in GoT.....I have watched it, trust me.  I focused on the sex as it stands out in my mind more than anything, but there is some violent content that I'd like to see edited too.  

Yes, the best thing to do is wait, but she's into a lot of young adult books and even anime that really shakes up the reader (ie people die) and they've been compared to GoT and she's curious.

But the major reason I don't see why is that it guarantees you nothing. 

With Robert (as well as previous kings and kings following him) the richest family in the Westeros is House Lannister. The show never once states directly or even hints at the idea of taxes or tithes. So money isn't a driving factor 

The best military's to in the realm seem to belong to the hardy members of House Stark and the battle hardened Marchers of House Baratheon. And yet the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms never expanded past Westeros. So you have their fealty...but why? You're not leading them anywhere to conquer anything. The only reason you want their fealty is so someone else can't take the Iron Throne from you. So you basically have 9 armies loyal to you...but no one to fight.

House Tully and House Tyrell have the most fertile lands so feeding their people is easy. They don't rely on the Iron Throne for anything and they apparently only feed King's Landing when it benefits them. So you're at their mercy come winter.

House Martell managed to hold off the Valyrian invaders and only joined because of a marriage alliance. But they offer nothing valuable. No loyal fighting force, no huge amounts of wealth, and no significant trading ports. 

House Arryn seems to have an imposing military but have great pride in their honor and Andal ancestry so why would they have any undying loyalty to the King?  

And then there's the Iron Islands. Useless in literally everything. They believe in slavery, they're pirates, have never participated in any war the Realm has been involved in, have no resources except salt and rock. But hey salt is needed to preserve meats. One problem though. They don't trade because that would be paying the ""gold price"" which once again you don't have because taxes don't exist.

So what's the appeal? Without dragons being held over everyone's heads why wasn't there an independence movement a long time ago? If you sit on the Iron Throne why not tax the houses, call all of your banners and go and take the Free Cities or something? This is just something that pisses me off. It seems like Westeros was better off killing each other for minor glories.",17,1,False,self,,,,,

1) State where you are from (country).

2) What makes the show so successful? 

3) Why do so many people enjoy the show?

4) What contributes to the show's success, as it seems to appeal to such a wide audience?

5) Why do people pirate the show, instead of watching it legally and thus giving the show-runners more money?

6) What are the pros/cons of watching the show legally?

7) What are the pros/cons of watching the show *ill*egally?

8) How can piracy be stopped, so that viewers are drawn to watching the show legally (i.e. DVD, TV.)?

9) Should there be stricter laws on piracy?

10) Besides legal repercussions if you do not stop pirating, how else can piracy be stopped?

As the perpetrator of the infamous red wedding, Walder is hated by everyone in Universe and out of it.

However, it all that hate justified? Is Walder a black-and-white 2D villain that deserve the worst of the worst? Is Robb the Young Wolf completely innocent and right? I don't think so, and in this thread I will justify at least some of the charges levied against the Lord of Twin Towers.

**Misconception #1** The Freys are sworn to Riverrun, and thus the Freys are not in position to bargain. When the King/Lord rings, the Bannerman have to march. 

This is completely false. GRRM based Westeros on Medieval Europe, not Imperial Japan or China. Honor or not, A king (or a overlord) can only extract so much loyalty from their bannerman either by force (Say, Tywin model) or by respect (Ned loved by his followers).

Even within Asoiaf world, we can see hierarchy breaking down-In Robert's rebellion, a number of Storm Lords and Vale Lords sided with the Crown rather than their Lord Paramount, while others side with their Lord Paramount against the King.

Since the Tullys have neither Tywin-like fear or Ned-like Love within the Freys, the Frey could indeed go extract all they could from the Starks in exchange for their support.

Also, do note when Robb called his banners on behalf of his father, if I recall correctly, he said ""Lets see if their words are worth."" Even in the North, the command of your bannermen aren't guaranteed. (Hello, House Bolton)

**Misconception #2** It was just a stupid marriage pact, who cares!

Wrong. Marriage pacts are serious business. When a particular Frey later whined ""but the young wolf dishonored us first!"" He was not kidding. Let us recall the story of Jenny of oldstone [WOIAF], where a Targeryan prince fell in love with a commoner and broke his betrothal with a Baratheon heiress.

*Her father choose to declare war on the Crown.* The result was a blood rebellion of epic proportion. So yes, marriage pact matters. Especially to someone who contributed significant amount of troops to your cause.

**Misconception #3** But he could have settled! Edmure is a Paramount Lord!

Well, here is a bit of serious bad luck for the Starks. You see, Walder Frey (and the Frey's in general) are always looked down as ""Nouveau riche"", since their bloodline were merely 600 years long as opposed to the more established families of the realm. Everyone thought they were a bunch of ~~No good capitalist~~ Glorified toll booth collector.

Walder spent his entire life enduring insults. From the Tullys (Not showing up at his later weddings, and likely not arranging one of the Tully daughters for his sons), to the Lannisters (Tywin openly insulted Walder when he arranged his son to marry Genna Lannister), and likely all in between.

So the Stark+Frey marriages were going to be his big payoff before he died: At last, the Great Houses were going to recognize House Frey as a bigshot! 
They were going to be seated at the big table now!

In the book, Robb, by banging the poor westerling Princess (an ANCIENT, but POOR bloodline), not only it dishonored the Freys, it also implied no matter what the Freys do, they would always play second fiddle to the ""Older bloods."" In the show this is double worse, as Robb went after some odd Volantis ""Red Cross Nurse"" with no blood to speak of.  

Robb apparently needed ~~12 Knights and a couple dozen infantry~~(Nothing but a hot ass) than the Frey's 4000+. Talk about chopped livers! *What is worse, is that even if the Red Wedding didn't happen, Robb would had likely lost MORE loyalists, as the marriage of the lord/lady are usually rewarded to loyal bannermans, and Robb by marrying some foreign unknown, effectively said non of the North/Riverland girls are good enough.* 

To make the matter worse, the Freys played the second fiddle while committing treason against the Iron Throne.

Imagine signing up a contract that say, break a major law (murder/rape/kidnapping) for a million dollars, then, when you did the deed and is now wanted by the law, your handler told you ""Here is 100,000, you have to give me your guns too, ~~since I am leaving town.~~ bother to do something at last.""

I doubt anyone would be pleased at that situation. In fact, I could almost bet a person who committed a major felony for pay would be downright homicidal when the payoff was unilaterally reduced.

Which bring us to the final misconception of the night.

**Misconception #4**

Well the Freys could have just left and barred their doors-instead of a Red Wedding that damned them against Gods and men.

No they couldn't. As I point out earlier, what the Frey did was treason. And what the Young wolf do? Not only he hand over a consolation prize that is a fraction of value compared to a Queenship, he is also losing the war and ~~fleeing North~~ finally will get off his ass and actually bother attacking Lannisport, after milled around the riverland like a aimless moron since Season II.

And what is coming from South? The ~~FBI~~ Tywin Lannister, backed by House Tyrell and likely most of House Baratheon.

100,000+ men. Against a naked Riverlands. Oh, the young wolf also wanted the Frey troops too.

I think, at this point, Lord Tywin Lannister likely sent a not-so-subtle hint to Walder Frey: Either bring us the Young wolf, or there is going to a **downpour over the twins.**

So what can Lord Walder Frey do?

*Host a Wedding.*

Side note: Someone on the /r/ASOIAF thread pointed out Tywin couldn't effectively siege the Twins, or he died on the shitter anyway. Well, unfortunately, Walder didn't get a copy of Season 4 and 5. He wouldn't be able to know. And Tywin had a fearsome reputation, and Walder was damn pissed at Young wolf anyway. 

Side note #2: Yes Walder Frey screwed the guest right system for good and would be a bad decision ITLR, but lets face it, then man is 90s and clearly he don't give a fuck. The realm is done screwing with him! Plus, as far as both the show and books are concerned, the only true supernatural godly power of the realm is Rh'ilor. And judging by the Penis Leeches, actually arranged the Red Wedding. ",35,15,False,self,,,,,

Now I'm completely lost in the book, and I'm wondering if anyone can help. 

I thought I was around page 100, and resumed reading on a Tyrion chapter (where he meets Duck and Haldon), thinking I was in the right place because I had read the last chapter (where Jon sends off Sam and co.). Well, I realized I had no idea the context of this chapter, so I went back and found that I hadn't read a Bran chapter (page 66), but I had read the chapter before (Jon). 

You may think ""Oh you just skipped a chapter or three"", but I remember Brienne being hanged, Sam leaving Gilly on the boat and meeting the Maesters, and Tyrion being stuffed into a barrel and put on a ship or something like that (the last thing I remember), and Petyr telling Sansa who she will marry after her descent with Robert, and those things are farther on. 

So really, my question is, where am I supposed to be at in the book? I have absolutely no clue. I know that this question is a long shot, but if anyone could help me, it would be greatly appreciated. ",2,2,False,default,,,,,

I can't remember which book, it might have been AGOT when we learn that the Targaryen House has married brother and sister for hundreds of years, and that Daenerys and Viserys would have once wed ~~and ruled~~(Rhaegar likely would have lived and ruled after his father) had Robert Baratheon not usurped.

In ADWD, [we believe that](#b "" Young Griff is actually Prince Eagon VI and believes his claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than his Aunts, but also believes marrying his Aunt Daenerys will help him win the Iron Throne due to her forces/dragons  "")

Leslie: ""Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow. God, that show has really gone off the rails.""

Ben: ""Look, it makes sense if you've read the books!""


Do the Parks and Rec people know something we don't? Do they have an in with GRRM? Ben Wyatt is a well known GoT superfan, if he says it then it must be true.

But seriously, Daenerys will need to get remarried at some point, and although its probably been discussed at length this seems like another opportunity to bring it up.

I think she dies fighting at The Wall, but Leslie Knope calls her Khaleesi, so she's probably taken over Khal Jhaqo's khalasar. Jack Sparrow=Salladhor Saan?

Dragon skulls and other artifacts are on display in natural history museums. Dioramas and elaborate paintings of ancient battles fill the museum to the boredom of the younger folks, who rather browse on their magic powered smart phones.

A Warning: Book reader here with some words on the upcoming season.  *oh know here we go a book reader over hyping the season again*. Well not really.  I've seen a lot of posts on this sub doing just that though.  Setting the bar for season high too high and setting up show watchers for disappointment.  In other words the season finale last year.  That's the purpose of this warning, to dispel that overhype and possibly lead to some people to be pleasantly surprised by this season.  Most readers agree that ""A Feast for Crows"" and ""A Dance with Dragons"" (presumably the books that season 5 will cover) were the least impressive of the 5 books Martin has written (wrote?).  This is because these books are largely set up for the final two books.  They (and most likely this next season) had significantly less action then the rest. This is not to say this season will not be good but it may not live up to the quality of the previous 3.  I'm sure Dave and Dan will add some content and excitement and maybe (hopefully) some of the stuff left out from the finale.  

A Favor: Most likely season 6 (and likely some of season 5) will pass the point in the story where the books are.  I ask the favor that you show watchers avoid the actions of some dickhead book readers who enjoy spoiling plot points for others.   Please do this despite your desire for revenge, don't be like those dickhead readers. Please.

TL;DR 

Warning: Be very weary of the hype.  Don't set yourself up for disappointment.

Favor:  When the show passes the book don't spoil it like some readers did.",12,1,False,self,,,,,

So far, I have to say, I'm not convinced. A few things that I noted.

1) The Dothraki are introduced as barbaric, animals. Fine. They were dressed in tribe wear, makes sense, they are a tribe. Also Fine. What wasn't fine was the fact that they were all black and/or middle eastern. After seeing a group of obviously Europeans dancing to what I can only assume is Irish music in the hall, as the Lannisters are welcomed,  this is how the ethnics are portrayed. Led by Khal (Khala is a Hindi word for black and im not saying that's relevant to the show but it did stand out to me) Drogo the 'Barbaric' 'primitive' ethnic people, dancing to african type music, in what i assume they've tried to make an african type of dance, killing each other seemingly for no reason, celebrating the new innocent little blonde girl that Drogo gets to do against her will. Rant over

2) I liked the concept of using the puppies growth as an indicator to the audience of time elapsed.

3) Seems very convenient that the puppy saved Bran and Catelyn from being assassinated. I swear Catelyn or Jon Snow were annoyed at all the puppies outside making noise and there was no evidence (was there?) That Bran's puppy was present or could have got to that room to save Bran.

4) How the hell did Catelyn find Lannister's single strand of blonde hair after an entire month of Bran's fall. Especially in a room full of (hay?). That was so annoying. And how did she suddenly piece everything together from that single strand!?

5) So much incest, so much sex!?

I can willingly suspend my disbelief at plenty and i know it's not meant be realistic, these are just things I noticed. Maybe all will be revealed but so far I'm questioning the hype. I will persevere

TLDR: So far all I'm seeing is racism,  sex, incest, and a lack of continuity in the story line. It seems like the programme is being controversial for no reason but to be controversial.  I hope it improves.

EDIT: Just want to make it clear that I have no moral obligation to them showing violence, sex or incest, nor does it make me feel uncomfortable. I just think it's presented very randomly, for the sake of being controversial. 
Also note. Did some googling. Apparently ALL the dancers at the wedding from the Dothraki tribe were black and in the book the Dhothraki are described as 'copper skinned' with 'dark almond-shaped eyes'. The show is trying to stay consistent with the book I assume and of course my view is subjective but then there's the music, the dancing on top of that. 

EDIT 2: The original post read that ""it was the first time we see black or middle eastern people"". I have edited this to more closely explain what I mean. I.e. That the barbaric, inhumane, tribal people were all portrayed by black and/or middle eastern actors. And that these are the only black and/or middle eastern people in the show (so far).

Just thought I'd share my absolute love for GRRM's writing here. A Feast for Crows, Brienne IV, we find Brienne and Pod being led to the possible location for the fool Brienne was looking for. The latter half of the chapter leads the characters through a haunting, foggy, dreary, eerie pine forest, and the imagery was beautiful. I was driving home from work on a dark, rainy road listening to the book on audio and I was entranced, feeling a bit nervous with the copious amounts of foreshadowing going on. This was simply so well written, and let you know something terrible was going to happen without being blunt.

This stems from a post about which main characters will die by the end of the series. There is some speculation and evidence in AGOT that Arya will die and be found ""frozen"" in Springtime. I actually feel that the line about Arya being found ""frozen"" means she will have lost all compassion and love. Let's think about her story line, she is a tomboy and a tough kid, but she is still a kid. Throughout the books that have been released she has learned that the world is really a terrible place and she must harden herself against it. She is being trained to be an assassin that essentially has no sense of ""self"". The training is trying to make her into a assassin that only kills for the many faced god. However, she is holding onto and successfully hiding her ""true self"" (ex. her hiding needle). I believe she will eventually break away from the House of Black and White. She will be a trained assassin with no allegiance to anyone but herself and what she thinks is right. I believe this is the meaning in called her ""frozen"", she will have no problem killing anyone and everyone that stands against her with little to no emotion. Or maybe I just like her character too much and GRRM will rip my heart out once again. Thoughts anyone?",8,11,False,self,,,,,

Enjoy! :),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2tlfzb/no_spoilers_i_just_made_android_live_wallpapers/,GameOfDroids,1422169319,"These are live wallpapers for Android that will flash to the music. I figured out how to do it from this XDA post (http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/themes/guide-making-live-wallpaper-reacts-to-t3011878).

Here's what it looks like:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/jalqekbc5vmqg1n/VID_20150124_224942.mp4?dl=0


Usage:

1. Download the GlowHeadphones Live Wallpaper (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ly.glowbrilliant.lwp)

2. Download my set of livewallpapers from https://www.dropbox.com/s/fef0wbfii6ej2ma/got_livewallpapers.zip?dl=0

3. Choose the house that you want and push the ""glow"" folder from that house into /sdcard/glow/ on your Android device.

4. Set your wallpaper to Glow (if it was already set, you need to set it again to reload it).

5. Play some music and enjoy! 



Note: Some people have been asking about the glow folder. You're going to have to make that yourself on your sdcard.

If you have adb installed, you can do: adb shell cd /sdcard/ mkdir glow

If you have no clue what adb is, don't worry. Either connect your phone to your computer and create the directory from your file manager OR download any file manager app on Play Store and create the directory from within the app that way. Hope this helps!

If so congrats if not then leave beacuse it's spoilers or you just forgot but back to the point, I have a theory about Jaqen H'ghar 

When he traveled away from Arya (I dont remeber what happend but he left) I think Jaqen H'ghar sailed to Essos and became...........Daario Naharis
I have many reasons that state that he became Daario 

1.Both look very much alike both share some facial features and nations

2.It fits with the timeline. I think it would take about a year or two to sail to Essos from Westeros or something like that and guess what each season is one year so that means from season 2 when he left and outwards to season 3 was him sailing from Westeros to Essos
 
3.Both of them have some connection with Bravos i dont know what it is but when Darrio got the coin from the chief of the second sons he acted ""weird"" and we all know the other coin that he gave to Arya

4. The reason he was recast was beacuse he changed his face i dont know why he would do that but whatever

And i hear you guys/gurls sayin ""But....If he changed his face why didnt Daenerys or the others notice?????""
Well thats the only flaw in my theory

I can't find the subject discussed, it seems like the true lord of darkness is somehow manipulating the red priest order for his/her plan. Bran's journey and current company don't seem like they're serving the darkness, also nature/greensight are prevalent themes, hardly evil. This is all superficial of course.

However the discord and chaos brought about by Melisandre and sacrifices and blood magic and shadows... seems rather dark? Thoros bringing people back from the dead, not like wights but still dark magic. Doesn't bode well. Dragons are also the bane of the others it seems like, yet no priest or priestess has found her to guide her to her true role etc etc. 

I'm thinking it'd be really beneficial for the true evil god in this series to pose as the good one,  stamp out influence from the actual benevolent one, and create as much chaos as possible to let the army of others finally do whatever they want to do.

1275,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-1-27,2015,1,27,5,2tr936,self.gameofthrones,[Mod Raven] Updates to Spoiler and Ban Policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2tr936/mod_raven_updates_to_spoiler_and_ban_policies/,kjhatch,1422303278,"**The subreddit's [Spoiler Guide](/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide) was updated today.**  It's a fairly large update that's been in development since last Summer.  Here's a quick rundown of what to expect:

**What Has Not Changed**

* The basic ""warn about your spoilers"" rule is the same as always.
* Everything we treated as a spoiler before is still treated as a spoiler now.
* The short [list of exceptions](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_example_details_that_are_not_moderated) is the same list too.
* Post spoiler tags still need to be at the title start with [square brackets].
* Comment spoiler tags still need clear labels that describe the covered spoiler.

**What Has Changed**

* There is now a fourth comment spoiler tag type: GAME.  It uses #p for ""play,"" and here's an example:    
&amp;nbsp;    
\[warning scope](#p ""your spoiler text"") 	
&amp;nbsp;    
[About House Forrester](#p ""Their sigil is a tree!"") 	
&amp;nbsp;  
* There are now two parts to a title warning: the required [Main Scope](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_main_scopes) and the optional [Extension Scope](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_extension_scopes).
* The Main Scope defines the overall book/show spoilers, like [B3], [All Spoilers], [Season 4], [TV], [ACOK], and [NO SPOILERS].  Most people already do that fine.  
* The Extension Scope is now a separate bracketed tag that adds more info, like [Episode 5], [THEORY], [Show Only], [GAME], and [LORE].  It's optional.
* The [post title tags](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_spoiler_scopes_.28for_post_titles.29) have been simplified using the more strict Main/Extension options.  They should be short and clear.  Instead of posting:    
&amp;nbsp;    
*[Season 4 Show Spoilers] Who's the best game player?*   
*[S2E8-E9 SPOILERS] OMG I just saw it!*   
*[Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons] What's with the old man?*   
*[ASOS/Season 5 differences/speculation] Do you think she'll appear?*   
*[GAME spoilers] Stuff I noticed that's in the show*   
*[Spoilers for the show maybe/some theory stuff] Speculation about Hodor's height*   
&amp;nbsp;    
Title tags should look more like:    
&amp;nbsp;    
*[S4] Who's the best game player?*   
*[S2][E9] OMG I just saw it!*   
*[ADWD] What's with the old man?*   
*[B3/S5][Theory] Do you think she'll appear?*   
*[TV][GAME] Stuff I noticed that's in the show*   
*[TV][Theory] Speculation about Hodor's height*  
&amp;nbsp;    
* The Automoderator scripts are not enforcing those tags yet, but they will. Use [the books-to-show table](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_main_scopes) to cross-reference what Main Scope tag is appropriate for your post.  
* The more strict Main tags will make the link flair more consistent, which will also finally fix the sidebar filtering options.  

**The subreddit's [Ban Policy](/r/gameofthrones/w/bans) was also updated last week.** The update changed absolutely nothing about the day-to-day moderation or how bans are handled.  The old version had wording that some people found confusing, so the document was rewritten to organize it better and communicate more clearly.  

**Also, the subreddit's [Posting Policy](/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy) will be updated soon.** The current doc has had a lot of ""clarification"" lines added over the past couple years, and it's overdue for a rewrite too.  No changes to the posting scope are planned; the document update is a cleanup/clarity operation.

If you have any questions about the new docs, especially the spoiler guide stuff, please comment here or [send a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) with your questions.

As you all probably know, we've got a pretty solid idea of several things that will be included in Season 5 and where they'll fall in the timeline of the season. I started the thread over at Westeros but I figured I'd start one here as well. What would you like to see the episode titles of Season 5 be? Here's my picks...

5x01: Valonqar (Cersei's Dream)

5x02: No One (Arya needs to become ""No One"" at the HoBaW)

5x03: Seven-Pointed Star (Faith Millitant is reborn)

5x04: Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken (Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne)

5x05: The Sorrows (Tyrion and Jorah float into the Sorrows) A Heart of Stone would be a great name IF LS makes her entrance here

5x06: Hear Me Roar (Cersei is arrested)

5x07: Sons of the Harpy (Tension's escalating in Meereen)

5x08: A Feast for Crows (Hardhome)

5x09: A Dance with Dragons (Daznak's Pit)

5x10: Winter (Pink Letter)

I really like the idea of the last three episodes being the same or similar to the books being covered in this season.",39,26,False,self,,,,,

The amount of joy to heartbreaking moments I had are to high to count. Many moments like Arya killing the first person on her list or joeffry getting the shit slapped out of him brought me pure joy. Then moments like the Red Wedding and the death of Yigrette nearly brought me to tears. I realized I love this show more than others and I truly feel connected to the characters.

So  I gave it a try and I finished all 4 seasons in one week and holy shit it was glorious every damn episode ended with a cliffhanger and I just couldn't stop watching. Finally I say I'm really looking forward to season 5 now, more so than the walking dead (considering it was the first series I ever watched and followed) believe it or not.

Also, was there any reason that Ramsay wanted it to be erect when he cut it off, beyond psychological torture? I'd think that this would result in way more blood loss, which doesn't really make sense if Ramsay wants to keep him alive.

So the purpose of this thread is to take some of the juiciest morsels of that fake history and share them with the non-readers who wish to gain an even deeper understanding of The World of Ice and Fire the ability to..

While I will post 10 or so interesting facts I think the non-reader might like, I can in no way hope to scratch the surface of the new information presented in these new works... So, I am calling on my fellow readers to help (looking at you /u/lukeatlook ), if you can think of an interesting bit of history garnered from P&amp;Q/TRP/and TWOIAF that I did not mention please feel free to share it in the comments... Thank you and let's begin..


------------- NOTE ON SPOILER SCOPE----------------

Well, here's my chance to try out the new spoiler scoping policy... I think I did it right... It is tagged [TV] because I don't want to limit discussion in the comments to hinder discussion on things that have happened on the show, or in the book up until where the show is currently at.   The ""extension"" tag of ""[LORE]"" is where the real meat and potatoes of what will be discussed in this post, from what  I make of the new spoiler guide ""LORE"" covers P&amp;Q, TRP, and TWOIAF... So I want to make it clear that almost anything from those novellas are fair game in this post.. I will try to keep the spoilers of P&amp;Q/TRP somewhat general and adhering to basic historical significance (as those two novellas do have somewhat of a narrative going on), and not go too deep into specifics if there is anyone still wanting to check those out... And as I have asked my fellow readers to post facts as well, I wish them to keep that in mind as well...  So with the formalities out of the way let's begin...


-----------------------------


**-IN WORLD NATURE OF THESE WORKS**

Unlike the main ASOIAF series, and ""The Tales of Dunk and Egg"" these three works discussed in this post are not presented via a view-point character(s)...nor are they a general 3rd person view of history presented for the reader..  ""The Princess and the Queen"" and ""The Rogue Prince"" (as we know them) as well as ""The World of Ice and Fire"" are presented as ""in-world"" histories within the ASOIAF universe...  These are books that Tyrion could read in his spare time.. he could walk into the library of Kings Landing and pick up a copy of *The Princess and the Queen, or the Blacks and the Greens* or *The Rogue Prince, or a King's Brother* (as they are titled in-universe) as well as TWOIAF (not sure of the in-universe title of this book) and learn from them if he wishes.  The in-universe author of P&amp;Q as well as TRP is a man known as Archmaester Gyldayn of the citadel, who lived prior to the main story taking place.  While the in-universe author of TWOIAF is a man know as Yandel, another Maester of the citadel, who lives and writes this history during the events of the first three novels/four seasons. 



**-Unreliable History**

Building of that last point, since these works are not from a POV character(s) and are treated as in-universe works of history the authors make note of and when historical accounts of events are not -reliable.  In TRP as well as P&amp;Q (both dealing with the timeline of the buildup and events of the Targaryen civil war known as the ""Dance of the Dragons"") Gyldayn cites many different souses he uses to establish his history, from the myriad of original witnesses who lived at the time, to the court fool (known as Mushroom) who was there at the time.  Yandel is the same he cites other works in establishing his history in writing TWOIAF, even Gyldayn himself (meaning that there are passages of TRP/P&amp;Q within TWOIAF)..  There is even bias presented in this history, specifically with Yandel.  Since Yandel writes TWOIAF during the timeline of the show/books when he covers the latter Targaryen monarchs (specifically Aerys II) he does so with an evident bias towards that of Robert Baratheon and Tywin Lannister, and that is present whenever Yandel discusses any recent history.. This is even evident in the dedication page of TWOIAF.. Originally dedicated King Robert, you can see the attempt to erase his name and replace it with Joffrey, and then finally dedicated to King Tommen..


**-The Kings Brother**

*He was the grandson of a king, the brother of a king, husband to a queen, two of his sons and three of his grandsons would sit the iron throne, but the only crown that Daemon Targaryen ever wore was the crown of the Stepstones*  

One of the More fascinating characters established in ""The Princess and the Queen"" and the central character in ""The Rogue Prince"" is that of Daemon Targaryen.  Brother of King Viserys I.  A cutthroat and a general, Daemon was an uncontrollable presence during his brother's reign.  Unhappy about constantly being pushed down the line of succession by the births of nephews, he disregarded marriages made a name for himself.  His most notable achievement was the conquering of the Stepstones that he ruled as king, though briefly, he shocked all by marrying his niece Rhanerya Targaryen (His third marriage, her second) and became her chief most general during her claim for the Iron Throne during the Dance of the Dragons..  During the Dance he used his seedy connections to arrange the death of one of his great nephews, and met with another nephew in a great dragon battle above Harrenhall, where he presumably died.  This guy was most defiantly a Rouge.  


**- House Muppet of Riverrun**

Now for the real stuff, the actual history... First here is an amusing bit about House Tully... TWOIAF has a brief section on the history of Hose Tully, specifically going into the family around the time of ""The Dance of the Dragons"".  There was Lord Grover Tully, who died during the Dance, he was followed by his grandson Lord Elmo Tully who died in the civil war as well shortly thereafter, and finally the reigns of house Tully was given to the new lord Kermit Tully who survived the Dance and presumably went on to rule Riverrun thereafter... If you are a child of the 70s you will certainly recognize these names.. as Elmo, Kermit, and Grover are all characters of ""The Muppet Show"", this was GRRM's subtle reference to the show..


**-Inheritance Customs of Westeros**  

One question alot of people have with the main series is how, given no elder male to inherit, how to laws of succession play out in this world.. Fortunately both TRP and P&amp;Q shed quite a bit of light on this.. When the Old King Jaehaerys I Targaryen lost his eldest son (that lived to adulthood) Aemon the succession of the throne was called into question, and instead of naming his granddaugter Rhaneys (only child by Aemon, and later known as ""The Queen who Never Was"") his heir as normal succession laws would dictate, he instead named his next eldest son, Baelon, as his heir.  However, Baelon too died before his father and the issue of succession was called into question again.  But this time a great council was called to settle the issue, this became to be known as ""The Great Council of 101"" and Jaehaerys I's grandson (and son of Baelon) Viserys was named the heir... Viserys I would inherit the throne when the Old King Jaeherys died. It is worth note that the Great Council of 101 set a huge precedent that would be cited for centuries to come when issues of succession would rise, while it did not establish a law, the precedent of a male uncle over a female daughter would be kept in practice until the time of our main story. 



**-Cregan Stark: The one day Hand of the King**

After the death of Queen Rhaerya it would have seemed that the Dance of the Dragons was over and Aegon II's claim was solidified, that is not the case however as those who had supported Queen Rhanerya continued on their cause in her son's (also Aegon) name, and were successful in doing so.  When all was nearly lost for Aegon II is was not the supporters of Rhanerya that finally did him in, it was his own councillors.  Aegon II met his end when one of his own members of the council poisoned him.. The King had gained many sever injuries during the war and was close to death regardless, but his death by poison ended the Dance for good... Rhanerya's eldest remaining son Aegon was a prisoner of his Uncle, and now a king, young King Aegon III ascended to the ruler of the seven Kingdoms.. Enter Lord Cregan Stark.. The Starks had fought beneath Queen Rhanery's banners during the Dance, and Lord Stark was named as King Aegon III's first hand of the King.  However Lord Stark only served as Hand of the King for one day, and his only order of business was to bring to justice those who had murdered King Aegon II, once justice had been served Lord Cregan Stark resigned his post and returned North, happily.  


**- The 5 Blackfyre Rebellions**

I have discussed in prior ""adding context"" posts about the Blackfyre Rebellions, but for a very brief reminder... The Blackfyre rebellions were the result for disputing claims to the iron throne when the legitimized bastard of King Aegon IV Daemon Blackfyre made a claim for the Iron Throne against his half-brother Daeron II Targaryen... This all happend about 100 years prior to the evnets of ASOIAF (and about a decade prior to the Dunk and Egg Novellas). Daemon Blackfyre lost his rebellion and died in the effort, however descendants of Daemon remained and made other attempts at the Iron Throne over the next few decades..  Prior to the publication of TWOIAF readers only knew of two much further ""rebellions"" (totaling 3) that of the failed attempt at the Tourney at Whitewalls, and the final effort of the ""War of the Ninepenny Kings"".. TWOIAF however provides us with two further instances in which House Blackfyre attempted to gain the Iron Throne. The Third Blackfyre rebellion took place during the reign of King Aerys I Targaryen, when Haegon I Blackfyre invaded Westeros in a short lived attempt at the Iron Throne, the 4th rebellion took place 15 years later, during the reign of King Maekar I Tararyen when Daemon III Blackfyre made a failed attempt and was personally slain by Ser Duncan the Tall.. Unfortunately little information is given to readers about these rebellions in TWOIAF, as it seems that GRRM is saving these to serve as backdrops to future installments of ""The Tales of Dunk and Egg""... One last note on the Blackfyres is that after the death of King Maekar, and during the council that led to the crowning of King Aegon V another Blackfyre turned up to lend his name to the secession debate.   Aenys Blackfyre (fifth son of Daemon I Blackfyre) wrote the council offering his name (peacefully) to be considered... He was responded to by none other than Brynden Rivers (aka Bloodraven) who offered him safe conduct to come to Kings Landing to put forward his claim... this was unwise as he was arrested and executed by Bloodraven upon his arrival in Kings Landing... For this Bloodraven was arrested by the newly crowned King Aegon V, and sentenced to death for the murder..  Bloodraven was allowed to take the black and sent to the Wall instead.  


**- Tywin Lannister and Aerys II Targaryen**

TWOIAF shed an amazing amount of light on the relationship of Tywin Lannister and Aerys II Targaryen (The Mad King).. enough to warrant it's own full ""adding context"" post truthfully, but in the interest of keeping it short.. They were friends since childhood, and Tywin had served in the Court of King Aegon V as a page where their friendship blossomed (along with Steffon Baratheon, father of Robert/Stannis/Renly)..  Over the years they were inseparable.  Tywin and Aerys fought side by side during the War of the Ninepenny Kings...  Though the rift in their friendship began much prior to Aerys being crowned king, and over a woman..  Joanna Lannister..   Much like his ancestor Aegon IV, Aerys was a womanizer, who kept many mistresses.. but a lady in his father's court caught his eye, Joanna who is rumored to have given Aerys her maidenhead during the coronation of King Jaehaerys II..  Later after Joanna married her cousin Tywin this attraction did not subside, while Joanna returned to Casterly Rock there were a few instances where they would be at the same occasion.. And each time Aerys would make rude and inappropriate remarks regarding Joanna in Tywin's presence, furthering the rift between the friends... The rift grew even further when Aerys became King and named Tywin his hand, and Aerys madness began to blossom in his early reign in the form of paranoia and wild ambition... as you know this would eventually lead to his undoing by the man he once considered his best friend. 



--------------------------------

Okay, there are a handful of interesting bits of fake history I think the non-reader might enjoy (and I've hit the character limit)... but like I said I barely scratched the surface of the new information that TWOIAF/P&amp;Q/TRP had to offer.. and if other readers want to post their own facts in the comments that would be amazing. I tried to hit on some of the larger items, but there are dozens of smaller details that could be explored by other users, who read these extra bits from GRRM who that they though worth note...  

I enjoyed writing this for you, and look forward to picking up the ""adding context"" series up proper this coming season.. I have in mind one more off-season post to put out in a week or two before that happens though, so stay tuned.. and have a great day.

The Dragon in the Season 5 trailer!

Now as we got closer and closer to getting this trailer, i knew we'd get atleast a glimpse of one of the dragons...but i thought for sure it'd be Drogon due to his big moment...but there's another dragon in ADWD that gets a pretty big moment that i'm pretty sure we all thought was going to get cut due to one of the characters involved in that scene not being cast, and by this i'm talking about Quentyn's little run in with Viserion.

Now in the trailer, we got a two second clip of a dragon, in an extremely dark room, shooting fire. If you pause as the fire's coming out, you can see that this dragon is golden. And the darkness of the setting doesn't really fit the outdoorsy Daznak's Pit, so could this be that we got a glimpse of someone getting fried by Viserion?

I'm hoping that it's Quentyn...i really do...but with no casting of him, and more of a focus on Doran and the Sand Snakes, i'm still doubtful. But looking back at the set photos of the Pit, a lot of people noticed that someone was missing: Ser Barristan. Hmmmmm...maybe in the show Barristan has a run-in with the dragons? I don't know what he'd be doing down there, but that's the only main-show character not at The Pit i can see breaking into Viserion and Rhaegal's lair...unless they decide to make it anti-climatic and have like, a random thug or two try to break in...eh, we'll have to see. But what are your thoughts on this, guys?

(EDIT: Actually...wait a sec. Is my memory fuzzy or does the Viserion/Rhaegal scene take place after The Pit? Because maybe another person attempting to break in would be Jorah! Hoping to ride one of the dragons after Dany, ultimately leading to his death and the dragons' escape?)",15,5,False,self,,,,,

1. Jaime standing in Sept of Baelor over Tywin's body, female (Cersei) leaving up the steps.

2. Knights of the Vale riding across some fields.

3. Cersei standing over Tywin's body.

4. Jaime crying, presumably talking to Cersei over Tywin's body.

5. Jon arriving at Hardhome via small rowboat, hundreds of wildlings awaiting his arrival.  Could also be Eastwatch but based on leaks we'll assume it's Hardhome for the rest of the trailer.

6. Bronn drawing his sword, a spear pointing in his face.

7. Sons of the Harpy in their masks. May be worth noting that one of the masks looks similar to the skull on the gate in Lhazar when we meet Mirri Maz Duur, which is also similar to the skull on the table when Jorah meets Quaithe.

8. Petyr holding a crying Sansa on a hill (""Petyr - There's no justice in this world, not unless we make it"").

9. Ellaria, Nymeria, Obara and Tyene in the sand standing over a captive with a bucket on his head.  Nymeria whips the bucket off his head.  Captive is a bald man.

10. The Water Gardens/Sunspear

11. Petyr holding Sansa again, (Petyr - ""Avenge them"").

12.  Wildlings at Hardhome marching into the sea.

13. A young, blonde girl drawing blood from her finger with a knife.  Likely to be Young Cersei in the Maegi flashback.  Blood drips from her finger into a fire, flames intensify.

14. Tommen and Margaery's wedding ceremony, a Tyrion's Septon stands in the background, crowd inclues Pycelle, Cersei, Loras, Mace.

15. Lord of Bones leading a wildling host, has a badass staff.

16. Varys and Tyrion talking in the gardens of Illyrio's Manse. (Varys - ""I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come"", Tyrion - ""I will never sit on the Iron Throne"", Varys ""You could help another climb those steps and take that seat"")

17. Tyrion rolling out of a shipping crate, looking a bit haggard.

18. A crowd in the courtyard at Castle Black.  Familiar faces include Stannis, Davos, Melisandre, Jon, Alliser, Janos.  It appears someone is about to get sacrificed to R'hllor.  A figure near the foreground is guarded by two of Stannis' soldiers, looks like it could be Mance Rayder.

19. Cersei in what looks like a dungeon though she looks fairly pleased with herself.  Could be the unveiling of Robert Strong.

20. Varys and Tyrion walking through the streets of (probably) Volantis.

21. Someone with long, dark hair being chased through the woods on horseback by 3 riders, location must be southern as it's not snowing, looks like it could be the wood where Tyrion meets Shagga and Timmett, also could be generic Riverlands setting. seems unlikely to be Northern in this season but the weather was fine when Ramsay was playing in the woods last season so who knows?  The riders definitely do not look like the Knight's of the Vale seen later in the trailer.

22. Jon Snow looking pensieve, Longclaw looking awesome

23. Sansa in the bath, a guard at the door.

24. Two young highborn girls walking through some foliage, the footage looks slow and 'dreamy', most likely Cersei's flashback and the characters are Cersei and Melara.

25. A bald man holding a weapon standing alone outside the gate at Hardhome. Night's King?  Would be a weird entrance.

26. Interior view of the gate at Hardhome, some soldiers standing looking at the gate as if expecting an intruder, 4 men standing atop the gate.  An icy mist drifts through the gate.

27. Daenerys looking focused and stone-faced, spouting nonsense (Daenerys ""I'm not going to stop the wheel, I'm going to break the wheel"")

28. Jorah fighting a pitfighter in Daznak's Pit.  Pitfighter is well armored and wearing a helmet, he is twirling a long weapon, could be a scythe/spear.

29. A box opens on a table revealing a viper holding Myrcella's necklace in it's mouth.  Cersei is looking at it and probably understands it as a threat from Doran, despite it more likely being a threat from the Sand Snakes.

30. Tyrion still looking haggard and concerned. (Tyrion ""I don't think I'm ready for what I deserve"")

31. Cersei furiously barking at Jaime over Tywin's body. (Cersei - ""That little monsters out there somewhere drawing breathe"")

32. Mel walking purposefully with a torch, Nightswatchmen crowded in the background.  Could be about to burn a body.

33. As suspected Mel lights a pyre, not the same scene 'Scene 18' in the courtyard, the centrepiece there looked more like a gallows/crucifix as we saw on Dragonstone, this is the usual Night's Watch pyre with what looks
like an already dead nightswatchmen burning on it.  The body is holding something metal across his chest, I'm positive this is Maester Aemon and the metal is his Maester's Chain.

34. Tyrion drinking wine in the gardens of Illyrio's Manse again, still talking to Varys.

35. Jon Snow leading an attack (Jon - ""With Me!"").  Two hosts clash at Hardhome, looks like Wildlings vs. Nightswatch.

36. Jaime entering a Dornish palace, probably Sunspear, being followed Areo Hotah.

37. A woman in revealing vest moving seductively in front of a man sat on a bed.  Almost certainly Dornish, could be one of the Sandsnakes and Jaime/Bronn.

38. The lift ascending up The Wall.

39. Olenna either giving advice or making a threat. (Olenna - ""They'll never even fine what's left of you"")

40. Jon snow cutting down a wildling at Hardhome.

41. A Dornish rider in the sands whipping Jaime, knocking him off his feet.  Could be Obara Sand or Areo Hotah.

42. A Son of the Harpy in a golden mask in the streets of Meereen.  The wall behind him reads ""Kill the Masters"" from Season 4.

43. Reek looking reekish.

44. Two Dornish riders in the sands, the same scene as 'Scene 41', one of the riders bears down on Bronn about to swing his sword, Bronn, on foot, swings his sword first and cuts the horse down, the rider falls from the horses back.

45. The Faith Militant descending some steps in King's Landing.  Al wearing plain black robes.  Two of the militants smash open a barrel with axes, sending the contents pouring into the street.  There are lots of barrels in the background which suggests they've raided a pub and are disposing of the alcohol.

46. Arya arriving at the House of Black and White, standing before a Half-Weirwood/Half-Ebony door.

47. Arya in braavosi clothes standing at a dock, picking needle up off the ground and inspecting it.  Looks like she is struggling with the idea of losing her last possession from her former life.

48. Knight's of the Vale riding across the hills.

49. A Chessboard style Map of the North, similar to those used by Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon earlier in the series.  The pieces on the board are 'Flayed Man' pieces representing House Bolton, looks like their territory is roughly Winterfell, Dreadfort, White Harbor, Barrowton, Karhold, across the board are Burning Stag pieces representing Stannis, his pieces seem to be placed around Castle Black two other territories further west, could be Hill Clans or possible The Nightfort and The Shadow Tower.  A man walks past the table who looks like Stannis.

50. As in previous scenes, Tyrion and Varys still talking in the gadens of Illyrio's Manse. (Varys - ""The Seven Kingdoms needs a ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name"", Tyrion ""Good Luck finding him"", Varys - ""Who said anything about him?"")

51. Daenerys looking stone-faced again.

52. Rhaegal/Viserion roasting somebody in the dark, I think it's Rhaegal but everyone seems to disagree.

53. Dozens of rowboats with wildlings hastily rowing away from Hardhome.  They seem to be in a hurry as one wildling is swimming in the water trying to get aboard one of the rowboats and the man aboard the boat continues rowing, leaving him to swim.  Could be the wildlings abandoning their scrap with the Nightswatch and fleeing as the battle has been interrupted by arrival of The Others.

54. Missandei leaning in to kiss Grey Worm, who is laying down and teary eyed.  RIP Greyworm?

55. A pitfighter in Meereen deals a knockout blow to another warrior, being watched from the stands by Daenerys and Hizdahr.  Neither of the fighters are recognizable.  The one getting knocked out looks plainclothed and has dark hair. The victor is wearing leather armor and a black helmet, he seems to be hitting the other man over the head with his own helmet.  Speculated to be Jorah in disguise.

56. Melisandre exposing her tits in what looks like the Lord Commander's chambers.

57. Daenerys, Grey Worm, Daario and Barristan descending some steps, guarded by many Unsullied soldiers.

58. Another Dornish sands scene, 3 Dornish riders appear to have surrounded Jaime and Bronn.

59. Ellaria facing 3 Dornish spears, they appear to be taking her into custody. seems she is replacing Arianne in that regard.

60. A hand squeezing a chair.  Absolutely no idea what this is.

61. A bald wildling with a weapon I don't recognize getting pumped up, ready for a duel.  Wildlings looking on the background next to an unlit pyre/bonfire.  The weapon is like a weird scythe/poleaxe hybrid.  The attacker could be a wolf.

62. Two horsemen escaping from a stable/farmhouse into the woods.  One of these could be the rider being pursued in 'Scene 21'.  Generic Riverlands look to the setting.  The two horsemen are almost certainly Brienne and Podrick.

63. Sons of the Harpy killing Unsullied in the streets of Meereen.  A fire rages in the background.

64. Margaery being comforted by Tommen.  She's looking pretty vengeful/devious.  Could be that Loras has been taken into custody by the faith by this point.

65. Chaos in Daznak's Pit.  Daenerys, Daario, Missandei and Jorah stand in the middle of the pit, defended by 12 unsullied but surrounded by dozens of Sons of the Harpy in their masks.  In the stands the spectators are frantically trying to escape as they're being massacred by the Sons of the Harpy.  The stand is full of dead bodies.  Grey Worm, Barristan, Hizdahr and Tyrion are nowhere to be seen.

66. A raven flies into an icy cage.  There's a body in the cage, could be a decomposing body or someone dead/sleeping the cage using a flayed skin as a blanket.

67. The Harpy statue atop the Great Pyramid of Meereen is torn down. It descends the pyramid and crashes into the ground. The statue appeared to be descending into the steps where Rhaegal/Viserion are being held, perhaps that is how the dragons are loosed in the absence of the dragontmer Quentyn?  This scene must be a response their Queen deserting them by flying away on Drogon.  If the statue had been torn down before that I doubt Daenerys and co. would be enjoying a day out at the pitfights in the midst of a civil war.

Thanks for reading, any speculation/predictions based on these shots are welcome of course.",107,293,False,self,,,,,

Some indications that this is plausible: 

- No LSH in the show

- Sansa has almost nothing to do this season

- The Vale is not that far away from the Freys

- Sansa's identity could still remain largelly unkown to the rest of the kingdom in that role",22,22,False,self,,,,,

And yet in the new movie Testament of Youth (haven't seen it, don't want to see it, looks boring) for the first time I see that Kit has short hair.

Now I see three conclusions to jump to from this:

1. He did his scenes for this movie long enough before the shooting for Season 5 and so they were okay with it, knowing his hair would grow back in time.

2. He's wearing a wig in Season 5.

3. Stannis extols a punishment on Jon not too unlike Davos and his fingers.",11,1,False,self,,,,,

I heard that a guy recently sold the Robert crown (the grand prize) for 25k, but what would your opinion be for a fair price for the Joffrey crown (the first prize)? It has the certificate with it that says it was used in the production of Season 1 and 2.

Made out of Damascus steel (to look like Valyrian steel). I haven't seen very many higher resolution pictures of this sword floating around, so I thought I'd throw mine to the masses. It is #459 of 500, so there are only 40 left as of my purchase!

The pictures really do not give the sword justice, this thing is massive. Good quality build, though my handle appears to be slightly misshaped and there is a tiny scuff on the bronze on the other side - but all in all I am satisfied with it.

He seems to strongly seek acceptance from his father, but his father wants nothing to do with him. He was taken by the Stark's, and while they treated him well, there is no way that Theon could ever forget that they're his captors. Then, when he tries to do something on his own and be a bit more independent (Taking over Winterfell), he totally fucks it up and eventually he's captured and tortured beyond belief.

Season 4 and ASOS onwards.

But the trailer really disappointed me; yes there are some really cool bits (Like Jon at the wall, and all the wildlings; that looked cool and Arya's bits looked pretty awesome) but so much of it was lack luster..

Like Tyrion being with Varys, and Jorah at the fighting pits basically confirms the Tyrion/Jorah adventures aren't gonna show up right? (Also does that confirm Griff and Young Griff not showing up?)

And focusing so much on Dany really annoyed me also, a large percentage of the book readers and show watchers really don't like her yet she gets so much attention and I feel like the show is gonna focus everything on her which (in my opinion) is gonna suck.

And does Davos being at the wall get rid of the Manderly storyline that ties in with a certain son? I want that Frey hate, damn.

And not a single bit of Greyjoy footage which makes me think D&amp;D has kinda destroyed their storyline which sucks because I love the Greyjoy storyline..

And I'm still upset about them giving Arianne and Arys Oakheart and a bunch of other great characters the axe (Mind the pun there)..

Thoughts and opinions welcome of course and I know some people won't feel the same but I just felt like D&amp;D got rid of some amazing storylines and could've added much more :(",0,0,False,default,,,,,
