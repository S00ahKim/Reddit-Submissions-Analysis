I just read A Storm of Swords and had some questions, and things I might have missed. I'm reading it in another language than English so any places/names that has been translated might be wrong. (If my translation is unclear, just tell me and I will change it!)

The plot when they free Tyrion. He gets saved by Varys and Jaime, and as I understood Jaime forced Varys to do it. He later get to his father's ""house"". There he meets Shae and he kills her. Had she been on the ""other"" side all along(a spy) or just changed(more gold) when Tyrion got jailed? Why was she in chains, as I understand Tywin didn't approve of prostitutes(well apparently not).

Who is supposed to inherit the Casterly Rock if Jaime isn't his son anymore and Tyrion will never inherit it according to Tywin. I guess you can't be king and ruler of Casterly Rock at the same time(Tommen). Myrcella is married away and Lancel seems to ill to be the inheritor.


And finally the murder of Joffrey. Tyrion admits to his father that it was he who killed Joffrey, you have been reading from Tyrion's point of view and should have known if it was true(on the other hand, why would he claim he killed Joffrey if he didn't?) . And Petyr Baelish claims that it was Lady Ontella(?) that poisoned Joffrey.

If a question will be answered later in the series, please don't answer it :)

ill choose the respective week's most popular topics on the front page of r/ASOIAF or r/gameofthrones

the thing that i really need from reddit is the community aspect of it, i want other people from this

He takes a shield from the stables with a bat on it, the sigil of house Lothston. Afterwards he describes that the Lothstons used to rule Harrenhal but that they died out ages ago. Now in the series you can see a similar shield leaning against a table. Do you think this was meant, or is it a different sigil for a different house ? I guess they just overlooked it whilst filming, and they just needed some sigils that fitted the area they were in. It happens at around 53:15 in the episode. 

Any speculation or correction is more then welcome.

* No you shouldn't skip books 1 &amp;amp; 2 because you've watched the series (Seaon 1 is similar enough story-wise, but season 2 starts to change things which will confuse you in ASOS) (Also, miss out on lots of backstory)

* Yes you can read ADWD &amp;amp; AFFC at the same time but there's specific order which can be found [here](http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-reader-friendly-combined-reading-order-for-a)	

* Yes AFFC is slow but that's only compared to how fast paced and action packed ASOS is, now stop complaining and finish the book and you'll realise how good it is.



* For people looking to speculate on what will/might in season 3, have a look at any of [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/search?q=season+3+happen&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all) threads instead of filling the front page with reposts

(And by relevance, Season 4)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/15ykts/spoilers_asos_predictions_for_season_3/,BrockThrowaway,1357322065,"For a long time, I really believed that the show would push the book 3 epilogue reveal (Lady Stoneheart) to the end of Season 4.

However, as time has been passing, and I've been thinking more and more about it, I'm starting to think that she'll be the end of Season 3, not 4.

Not because viewers would forget about Catelyn, but because viewers will need *something* to grab hold of after the devastating events that precede it, and the reveal would be a fitting end to Season 3.

So, the question is, if you think the show will hold off on the reveal for Season 4, what do you predict will be the ending of Season 3? Similarly, if you think that LS is slated for Season 3, what's in store for the cliffhanger of Season 4? 

My prediction for Season 4 ending would be Tyrion murdering his father and escaping. Cue Game of Thrones season finale music, and a shot of him on the boat, pulling away, wider and wider as he escapes from King's Landing.

What are your predictions for Season 3 and Season 4's cliffhanger endings?

We know that Talisa is from Volantis and that her last name is 'Maegyr' which just so happens to be the last name one of Volantis' most powerful leaders. What is Talisa is the daughter of this Triarch, who was contacted by Tywin to assist him in his plans in exchange for assisting in the infestation of Red Priests that exist in Volantis (note that Stannis, another attempted usurper follows R'Hllor giving Volantis a reason to lend a hand. They don't want it to spread farther).

I believe that Tywin has contacted Volantis (in the same vain that he brought over the Brave Companions) as a part of his plot to end Robb Stark by planting a 'love interest' in his camp to tempt him away from his vows to the Freys. 

Talisa is also slated to appear during the infamous 'RW' which does not bode well for her. The only reason to be there is to either die, or be apart of it, as those who've read ASOS should know. I believe that Talisa is, regrettably, in on this plan (as opposed to Jeyne who was unknowingly apart of the plan). Perhaps the show wanted to build Robb up a strong female love who is struggling with a duty to her father and a man she was shipped off to tease and marry). She comments on how she doesn't like her Father, which indicates bad blood between them. Bad blood that could have stemmed from her not wanting to go through with this after having spent a long time being the 'little girl oppressed by her father'.

I think they're trying to add a dramatic love story to the already tragic events of the Red Wedding - but also trying to stick to the events of the books by doing so. It'd be interesting to see Talisa deliver the final stab to Robb, after being shot with a quarrel - while Roose grabs Catelyn leading to the infamous 'Jaime Lannister sends his regards' (Seeing as how it was her PoV that witnessed this line, It wouldn't be too terrible. And Jaime did have a lot of interaction with Catelyn in his cell).

Any opinions/ideas/thoughts?

One of the better-supported theories in the fandom is that the Westerlings had an integral part in the the Red Wedding-- notably they were welcomed back into the King's peace immediately afterwards. I believe Jaime hinted at their involvement in AFFC as well, but I can't at the moment recall the exact circumstances... maybe it's less a ""theory"" than an explicitly stated fact. 

With this in mind, I'm wondering if there isn't more to the ""Lady Talisa"" than she's let on? Perhaps the showrunners have taken the idea of the Westerlings' betrayal and magnified it, having ""Talisa"" lie about her heritage and name as a Lannister agent, sent to seduce Robb and gain valuable intel-- the whole marriage thing being an unexpected bonus, allowing Tywin to orchestrate the Red Wedding.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

2. Is Brienne dead? Is that last word she said revealed in ADWD, or do we still not really know what happened there?

3. I'm assuming Margarey is actually guilty of adultery, but exactly how much of the stuff Cersei was planning was true? Was the singer totally not involved at all, and she just used him because he was convenient? Who did Margarey actually sleep with? Also, is what Qyburn was actually doing ever really explained?

Maybe because they just want to name another city, from another country, in order to establish there is more? Or maybe to make it clear she is really a 'foreigner' to the men from the North?

I quickly started reading the first two books in my foreign language (german), but as the english ones are cheaper and more epic (and my english doesn't suck that much), I started to read ""A storm of swords"" in English.
Maybe this was said before or is known anyway, but I was just amazed by the emotional reaction that occured by reading the chapter of Edmure's wedding.

I don't even know if I have to put this in spoiler tags...
[ASOS](/b ""I knew all the way, that Robb's story would probably not end well. Nonetheless, he became my favourite character in the story so far, even though he lacked a bit of characterisation and was, in fact, not that outstanding. I think it's just amazing how Martin made me hope until the bloody bitter end, that Robb is somehow going to make it. Well I at least hoped Robb Starks death would be epic. I'm not sure about that yet... But there is one thing I bloody know, that I want to punch Walder Frey in his ugly fat face and beat the crap out off his ass until he regrets every damn thing he did to the Stark family."")

Damn, right now I just feel a mixture of rage and sadness and I'm probably not going to be able to sleep for hours. Not speaking about tomorrow mornings Math lecture.

This spoiler is probably beeing to long and I'm probably going to get flamed for telling the obvious, but I just wanted to tell you how amped I am right now. I damn love this series, GRRM, keep up writing stories that are so powerful and create so strong emotions. You are the best!!!
Additionally I want to thank this subreddit for posting awesome stuff every day. Damn I'm even afraid of reading possible comments in case I could get spoiled.
I just wanted to post this, cause I really cannot sleep right now...

Stark makes a point of this when he says that he doesn't fight in tournaments so that his enemies won't know what he can do.  

When one of the guards wounds him, Jaime attacks the guard out of anger.  Do you think he does this because he think he is better than Stark and wanted his chance to prove it?  Or is he just angry that he'll never get to know for himself?  Also who do you think would have won in that fight?

Personally I think that Stark would have won, because I feel as though Stark's only weakness was his inability to understand the Game of Thrones.  I've always thought that head to head, Ned would have beaten anyone, even Robert in his prime, but there's not that much to base this on.  So let me know what you think Reddit.

R. Martin, along with an extra copy of Book 1 autographed as well. Just wondering if anyone would be interested in buying these from me. You're probably wondering how I got so many autographed, and want to call me out on this right now I'm guessing. Well, they are real, and this is how:

When I was going to college, I was able to write computer code to enter sweepstakes for me. It started out just me and a friend seeing if we could do it, but then we started winning things. So we kept writing. Well, [this](http://www.wordandfilm.com/2012/03/headline-enter-to-win-the-game-of-thrones-ultimate-experience-sweepstakes/) was one of the sweepstakes we had out code entering for us. We wanted the Grand Prize, a trip to Comic-Con, but I won First Prize - an autographed copy of the First book, and a copy of the rest of them. Well, the autographed copy of the book came to my house, with a note that the others would be mailed separately. Then a day later, I get an email telling me that Mr. Martin had decided to sign them all for the winners. At this point, I wish I had kept that email and it would be easier to prove this. Anyways, the second box of signed books came, along with another signed copy of the first book. Being that I work full time along with attending grad classes full time, I really don't have enough time to read these, although I wish I did. To be honest, right now I need the money to pay off my school loans more than I would like to keep these, unfortunately. I figured I could throw a post here and see if anyone would like them. I know you guys would be able to appreciate them more than I.

Below are a couple pictures I took this morning really quick. If anyone ends up actually interested in these, I will obviously get more and better pictures tonight when I get home.

We have a lot coming up in a very short time, and this seemed to be a good moment to take an opportunity to go over the current state of the subreddit and the plans for the immediate future.

Last year while Season 2 aired /r/gameofthrones' activity level was ranked 21st, just after the default subreddits.  That equates to millions of pageviews each month (May was over 10mil, 5x the norm), and thousands of new subscribers *a day*.  It seems likely that Season 3 will bring even more people in to participate, so expect a lot of new faces around here. 


----

**Best of 2012**
---

Reddit's new community-centered ""Best of"" competition has come and gone.  You can see the nominees, votes, and winners in [the main Best-of thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/156601/).  The new flair and gold prizes will be distributed later this weekend.  Overall the event's success was hit and miss, and it seemed counter-intuitive to hold a large annual event at a time when most people aren't even online.  The Reddit Admins also didn't have everything planned ahead with changes to the gold creddits setup and a new voting mode posted after the event was already underway.  If we do a /r/gameofthrones Best of 2013 event next year, we'll mostly likely set up our own structure and timing to better fit the community regulars here.

----

**What To Do While Waiting for Season 3**
---

There are two ongoing weekly discussions scheduled to run up until Season 3 begins: [Topic of the Week](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xoa22/) and the [Re-Watch, Re-Discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/162pji/season_2_spoilers_with_12_weeks_to_go_and_12/).  

* The Topic of the Week covers popular subjects from both the show and books.
* The Re-Watch, Re-Discussion threads cover one episode a week and are just finishing up Season 1 now.  

Links to current posts for both can always be found in the subreddit header.

----

**Spoilers!**
---

We get a lot of new traffic in the subreddit from both the casual fans who participate only around the season and all the new fans who are just starting to read or watch right now.  We'd like everyone to be able to join the discussions without fear of spoilers.  It's really important to be extra-careful with spoilers as the traffic surges over the next few months.   

The moderators posted many warnings late last year that said we're going to be less lenient about major spoilers going forward.  That's already happening.  An update to the Spoiler Guide will be posted very soon that has additional descriptions of what content is moderated and why.  Hopefully the added transparency will help everyone enjoy the ASOIAF/GOT community together, better.

----

**Call for More Moderators**
---

We'll be adding more moderators for /r/gameofthrones in the coming weeks.  Like /r/asoiaf, we're doing a formal application process this time.  If you're interested in becoming a moderator for /r/gameofthrones, keep an eye out for the announcement post in the next day or two.  You can also [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) to express your interest.  We keep a list of volunteers, and we'll message you once the announcement is up.

----

**Subreddit Scope Reminder**

This is the ""mainstream/casual"" subreddit for GRRM-related topics, and the content scope for /r/gameofthrones is more open than any of the other GOT/ASOIAF subreddits.  Most everything that's directly GRRM-related can be posted here, but not everything is useful or relevant, so the scope has shrunk over the last couple years to keep the discussions on-topic.  Please be mindful of what you post to help maintain the quality of the content here.

Even with a wide scope there have been many recent posts pushing as the allowed content limits.  Here are a few issues that need reminding:

* MEMES must be built with GOT media to be relevant.  We don't allow rage posts at all anymore, and in order to keep allowing memes at all they have been limited to GOT media to keep the related-level high.  Taking a random meme pic and changing the text is not enough for it to work here.  All of the other rage/meme posts should be submitted to /r/asongofmemesandrage.
* REPOSTS are getting more and more out of control.  Lately the items lazy-reposted over and over have been top on the Hot default page the whole time.   Sure, a lot of is caused by random people wanting to whore some quick karma, but regular subscribers ought to at least check the homepage before submitting.  Please wait at least two weeks before reposting.
* ACTOR posts are only relevant if they are about the actor in the context of the show.  So filming photos, fans meeting the actor on the street, the actor at an awards event, etc. are all current and relevant.  Posts about the ""discovery"" of the actor in an older film/show are not relevant.  People know how to use IMDB; it's not news.
* MERCHANDISE posts to places where people can buy the item(s) are helpful to know.  A photo of your new book or t-shirt is not relevant unless you've done something to make your post unique/interesting that's different from all of the other book/t-shirt/etc. posts that have been made.  Craft posts are great, so for example if you take apart your book and turn it into art, that would be something new the community hasn't seen before.

Also, posts about Hodor are good for posting to both /r/gameofthrones and /r/hodor!

**The Wiki is Coming!**
---

Reddit [re-released](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14oo1q/moderators_the_new_integrated_wiki_system_is_live/) the [new Wiki system](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/th1zo/moderators_new_feature_preview_integrated_wiki/) a few weeks ago (FINALLY!).  The process of moving all of /r/gameofthrones' content from the old Wiki and static posts into the new system started the day after, and the wiki will be turned on for the public soon.  All of the updated subreddit info is in there and will be posted at the same time.  The /r/gameofthrones header and sidebar links will be updated to reflect the new pages, and it should all happen this week.

**Roll Tide**
---

Completely unrelated comment for mod [bobosaurs](/u/bobosaurs), our resident Alabama football fan, who has had an even harder time not saying ""Roll Tide"" in every mod thread after Alabama won the National Championship this year.  If you like the team, stop by /r/rolltide or /r/cfb and give him a Roll Tide. :)

I was thinking 4 portraits of; Joffery, Robb, Daenerys, and Stannis and perhaps the white walker from the end of season 2.

What I need help with is finding the best portrait(Can take a screenshot so just give me the episode and timeframe).


For Daenerys I was thinking the [S01E10](/s ""end of season one with the dragon on her shoulder but it is a bit far, perhaps somewhere in season 2? "")

Joffery probably when [S01E7](/s ""he's on the Iron Throne with the crown on his head looking as vicious as usual."").

For Robb perhaps a scene where he is riding Grey Wind (If he actually does in the show but I think that's my imagination from the books or something).

Stannis I'm not really sure.



Also I don't think I can use the Iron Throne as it is in pretty much in every ""poster"" and that is not allowed. I will check if I can put the Iron Throne but if not, ideas for a background? Perhaps a mix of the different landscapes? Game of Thrones has beautiful landscapes.



TLDR: Need to make a ""poster"" of GoT using photoshop for school, need ideas for which characters to put and timeframe for portraits of them from the show. Also best background other than the Iron Throne.

However, myself and some friends think he is still alive and have a theory as to why. Melisandre showed extreme interest in Jon throughout the entire book. Because of this, we think that Jon is the true Azor Ahai, not Stannis. Further adding to this, Jon's sword Longclaw, could really be Lightbringer since him and Sam believe that it is capable of killing the Others because it is made of Valyrian steel. If Jon really was killed, I believe that Melisandre will bring him back to live via the same ritual that Thoros uses to bring Lord Beric back to live. 

I know this isn't the best theory ever, and I may just be looking for a way for my favorite character to remain in the story.

We're now accepting applications, and if you'd like suggest someone else for consideration, please [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) so that we can invite them to submit an app.  The goal is to maintain the consistency and relative spoiler-safety the subreddit provides even while the Season-surge is ongoing.

**To apply for a moderator position with /r/gameofthrones, please answer the following questions and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) with your responses.**


1. Please tell us a little about yourself.
2. Why do you want to be a moderator for /r/gameofthrones?
3. How long have you been on Reddit? (note: If you have another account that is older than the one you're using now, please mention it)
4. How do you usually browse Reddit? (desktop, phone, tablet, etc.)
5. How often do you visit /r/gameofthrones?
6. Are you active in any other related subreddits?
7. How many seasons of the show and books of the series have you watched/read? (note: Being current on the show or books is not a requirement, but moderation does guarantee some exposure to spoilers)
8. Have you moderated any other subreddits, and what were your duties on each?
9. How do you respond to insults, profanity, slurs, and/or trollish comments?
10. What is your time zone, and what times are you usually on?
11. Do you have a problem with any of the posted subreddit rules?  If so, please explain which and why.  (note: disagreeing with the rules does not hurt your chances of being selected; we want to know you understand them and can be constructive with discussion)
12. What do you think could be done to improve the user experience, and what can you do to make it happen?
13. What do you think is especially great that should never be changed?
14. Why should we choose you over the other applicants?
15. Do you have any questions, comments, or anything else you would like to tell us?

Not required, but we're also generally looking for this criteria: 

* Reddit account older than six months.
* Positive karma score that's over 1K in either links or comments.
* The subject matter here is often mature, so being at least 18-years-old is preferred.

Extra credit questions, also not required:

* Provide an MS Paint drawing of why you should be moderator.
* Do you have any pets?  How many and what kind?
* What is the greatest football team of all time, and why is it Alabama? (bob wants to know if you can roll a tide)

(All spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/16gs1t/could_a_lateasos_death_occur_in_s3_all_spoilers/,TMWNN,1358038554,"Westeros.org links to [a new interview with Julian Glover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ak_kQo7QmP4#!), who plays Grand Maester Pycelle. He says the following at 4:30 when discussing how he'd like Pycelle to die:

&gt;You wait 'til you see how Charlie Dance dies. That is really funny, and of course I'm not going to tell you.

 and later:

&gt;[I want] a death as interesting as Charlie Dance's.

Glover has not read the books, and doesn't know whether Pycelle has died in the series yet. He could, of course, have heard (as Dance has) of Tywin's death secondhand. However, another possibility is that Tyrion's killing Tywin on the toilet will occur in S3, not S4 as one would normally expect.

Other highlights:

* Glover believes that he is the only actor who has appeared in the Bond, Doctor Who, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and now Game of Thrones franchises.
* He hasn't read the books because he dislikes people comparing scripts to the original material.
* Glover was amazed by Ned's death in 1x09, describing it as akin to killing Hamlet midway in the play, and at first thought he missed something while reading the script. He called doing so a very courageous thing to do.
* He was very impressed by the special effects used to depict the Wall.
* Glover has known Dance since the late 1970s when they were both in the Royal Shakespeare Company. They also did a Bond movie together.
* He says Tyrion is his favorite character and repeatedly praises Peter Dinklage, calling him ""a wonderful actor"".",19,9,False,self,,,,,

Its basically what happened with every character in ADWD. Its not meant to be a positive review, but sadly I was disappointed with ADWD and found this amusing.

SPOILERS AHEAD

I'm Varamyr Sixskins. I'm here for the prologue to set us all up for the impending horrors of the North and all the excitement to come...

I'm Tyrion Lannister, the most popular character in all of Westeros! I spend this book meandering down a really slow river, ruminating bitterly about my life, misplacing my former charm, eroding all the goodwill I built up in the other books, and wondering where the whores go. Though perhaps I should have been wondering where the plot went. I also observe turtles and women, play board games, mouth off to all and sundry, and coincidentally run into various characters like some wandering monster in a D&amp;D campaign. Maybe I'll make it to Daenarys in the next book, but at least I ditched that pig.

I'm Asha Greyjoy. I don't have much to do, so I'll be the POV character keeping track of Stannis and his forces. At the beginning of Dance with Dragons, he's working his way towards Winterfell to take it back from the Boltons. At the end of Dance with Dragons, he's...working his way towards Winterfell to take it back from the Boltons. Hope that helps.

I'm Ser Davon Seaworth, the Onion Knight. I'm still running errands for Stannis and getting captured frequently. It's a living.

I'm Bran Stark. I am a tree.

I'm Daenarys Targaryen. I'm only a young girl, and I know little in the ways of war, governance, what have you. I used to think I said these things to misdirect people, but as of DoD it seems to be true. I spend my time taking baths, fretting, being wishy-washy, and mooning over this hot mercenary dude. In the end I learn that ""you have to go back to go forward."" I would have thought that going backwards would be the last thing that this book needs, but I am only a young girl and know little of the ways of story advancement.

I'm Aegon Targaryen. I appear for the first time in book five as the long thought dead son of Prince Rhaegar and the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. I know, right? What a surprise! It's like I was just pulled from thin air! I spend much of the book traveling to Daenarys, but then I change my mind and go and invade Westeros without her. Sort of. No one important has noticed yet. See you in the next book!

I'm Griff, aka Jon Connington. I'm here to get Aegon Targaryen on the Iron Throne. I tried to tell that kid not to wait until the fifth book to show up if he wants to be king. Now nobody's invested in us. We're like, peripheral characters or something. Nobody cares. I (*sniff*) just want someone to care, you know?

I'm Theon Greyjoy. Turns out I'm not dead, though I rather wish I were. It's been rough. On the bright side, my chapters were some of the only highlights of this bloated beast of a book. I even got to be almost a hero at the end! Can't wait for the next book. Redemption arc ahoy! People like me now!

Tyrion: Settle down sailor. You're not really a major character, and people still don't like you.

I'm Jaime Lannister. I snuck in to steal a chapter just like I would steal a kiss from my sweet sister. Oh look, there's Brienne! She's not dead after all. Whatever could have happened? Oops, we gotta go now, so I'll guess we'll never know. Blink and you'll miss us!

I'm Ser Robert *cough*Gregor*cough* Strong *cough*not dead*cough*. Gregor SMASH!

I'm the Hound. You know, I strongly suspect that I might not be dead either.

Tyrion: Quiet, you. No one even mentions you in this book.

I'm Wyman Manderly. I'm a minor character, but I bring a bit of awesome anyway. I was last seen bleeding from a neck wound. I wonder if I'll die. Your guess is as good as the author's.

I'm John Snow. I command the wall and defend Westeros from the horrors of the North. I count sides of beef and sausages, receive messages, meet with my staff, greet newcomers, and find bedrooms for all the wildings. Seriously, am I a commander or a butler? It's the end of the book already, we need some action! I'll march on Winterfell and retake it from the cursed Boltons! Away we go! Oh, dang it. Stabbed from all sides. There goes that plan. It sure does seem like I'll die now...

I'm Quentyn Martell. I'm kind of a side plot that has no impact at all on the main story. Then I die. But the good news is that I really am dead for sure!

I'm Melisandre. I get a chapter where I play with fire and see things and act all cryptic with people. Well, I have to amuse myself somehow. It's booorrring at the wall.

I'm Victarion Grayjoy.
Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main!
This book will end
Before I meet
Daenarys Targaryen!

I'm Aero Hota. Don't worry, I don't really remember who I am either. Not much to see here, anyway.

I'm Cersei Lannister. I get two chapters of humiliation. I can has some of Theon's reader sympathy now? No? Well then. I won't forget this. A Lannister always pays his debts...maybe in the next book.

I'm Ayra Stark. I'm in two chapters, too, and I kill someone, like I always do. But this time it's different; this time someone told me to. That's progress. Maybe someday I'll kill someone who has something to do with the main story.

I'm Barriston Selmy. I putter around Meereen, trying in some small way to advance the plot. Alas, to little avail. I'm too old for this.

I'm Kevan Lannister. I waited a thousand pages for a POV and all I got was this lousy epilogue and a quarrel in the chest. Oh well. At least I'm well and truly done with this mess.

Varys: Maybe.

We're the Others. We are the horror of the North and theoretically the real Big Bad Threat in this series. It's five books in, and we still haven't really gotten to do anything yet. To be honest, we're too bored to bother any more. We're going to invade Canada instead and subdue them to our icy will. Apologies everyone!

My friends are getting sick of me, and I need to vent.

1) WHAT THE HELL DID THE STARKS EVER DO TO GRRM?! Seriously though... I know Jon isn't officially a Stark, but he's Ned's kid more than anyone sooo I'm counting him. GRRM paralyzes Bran, lord knows where Rickon is, Robb &amp; Catelyn get murdered, and now JON!? Jon cannot be dead. NO. no.

2) Although I've always been a fan of Dany, book 5 really made me question her decisions. I didn't support her 100%. But then........ DROGON COMES AND STARTS KILLING PEOPLE! &amp; she comes and is like PSH, I'M THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS AND YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME and rides off on him!?! That did it for me. I was seriously so excited, I was literally aroused. Amazing, Dany, amazing.

3) Following that, why did the next Dany chapter have to be such a let down? As much as I wanted her to be charring some Lannister flesh in Westeros, I understood why she might not be... but she needs to be rescued? Eats some bad berries? Might die on her own? SHE'S THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS! She is not some good for nothing, incompetent princess (anymore). 

4) Where the hell is Jaimie!? What is he up to?! I miss him so much =(

Okay, I got most of it outta my system. Overall, the book was great. It was no where near book 3 IMO, but, quite frankly, I doubt that book could be topped. ",19,0,False,self,,,,,

If the story is yet to come, please ignore me. If not, where did he come from, and how did he come to be on the Kings Counsel?

He and Little Finger are two of my favorite characters. I know enough of Little Fingers past to speculate about what he may do in the future, and wanted to do the same for Vareys.

All the major families had a significant impact in history dating back to when Aegon The Conqueror invaded Westeros and forged the Seven Kingdoms into 1. 

Stark: Date back to the First Men, Kings of the North

Greyjoy: Kings of the Iron Islands

Arryn: Descendants of the Mountain Kings (Andals)

Lannister: Descendants of Lann, Kings of the Rock

Baratheon: Took over the lands and holdings of the Storm Kings during the Conquest

Tyrell: Kings of the Reach (Gardener), passed on to the Tyrells (stewards to Gardener)

Martell: Kings of Dorne


The Tullys were never Kings, and there's no account of them during the Conquest. Are we ever made aware of the history of House Tully? To arrange marriages with both Stark and Arryn, the Tullys must have been quite a strong force at the time of Robert's Rebellion.

Does anyone know when they came to be and when they grew to be such an honorable house in Westeros?",27,25,False,self,,,,,

So sorry if this is explained later on.

I had the idea appear in my head. Who inherits Casterly Rock and all Lannister land if Tywin Lannister sees an early death? I know this may be simpler then I think but since Jamie is of Kingsguard he cannot inherit  (based of wiki [Members of the Kingsguard are sworn for life and are forbidden from owning land...](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard)

So does that mean Tyrion would inherit Lannister Land? But knowing Tywins relationship with Tyrion wouldn't he disinherit in some way? If so who inherits after that? Cersei maybe but i don't know how if Lannister succession lets women and if it does wouldn't that make Joffrey inherit eventually? Wouldn't that not be welcomed, the king out right ruling one of 7 Kingdoms be unwelcome? But if Cersei is unable to inherits who then Get Tywins Lands once he dies?

after being totally fascinated by the show I decided to read the books as well. I'm halfway in ASOS now and damn those books are an awesome read. But I don't think I'll have to tell you that.


One quote that really stuck with me and that I found very inspiring is part of a conversation between Arya and Jaqen. It's in ACOK, Harper Voyager edition, p. 618.  [ACOK](/b ""It's shortly before Arya names Jaqen himself as the next person to die to get him helping her freeing the captives."") She asks him if she really could name anyone, to which Jaqen replies:


*""Speak the name, and death will come. On the morrow, at the turn of the moon, a year from this day, it will come. A man does not fly like a bird, but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there, and a king dies.""*


In my opinion it's a great quote showing that persistence, focus and devotion to a cause can get you anywhere, that you can achieve great things by working hard every day.


My question would be if someone who is good with Photoshop (because I don't have the slightest idea how to use it) could make me some kind of motivational poster with this quote or alternatively just the last sentence and [this as a background image.](http://i.imgur.com/uVFCaWg.jpg)
You wouldn't necessarily have to use a classical font, I wouldn't mind a more modern style.


Thank you in advance.",20,7,False,self,,,,,

I must remember!""...but of course it made no sense to me and i quickly forgot it. In hindsight, all her dreams make perfect sense! for example:
/b ""SoS I dreamt a wolf howlinh in the rain, but no one heard his grief, (...) I dream such a clangor i thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs.

Well the wolf and the 'music' obviously refer to the /b ""SoS red wedding and the feeling of defeat that has come over Robb"".

--In the books he doesn't appear again until Petyr and Sansa get to the Vale where he is then blamed about Lysas death

In the TV series however he reappears in King's Landing for the famous [""the finger or our tonge"" scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwtsVX3DjC0) and he then gets his tongue cut out by Joffrey/Ser Ilyn(which is a great scene btw to show off joff's cruelty/sadism) but if he has no tongue, how will he reappear in the vale, as he is a pretty important character at that point ? Will the have him without a tongue but just happen to be in the room when petyr kills lysa ?",11,2,False,default,,,,,

Ok, so I know that Daenerys mentions her betrayels throughout the books, but I'm still not sure what each one is (I'm halfway through a Dance with Dragons). She also mentions something about Brown Ben Plumm, and I'm not entirely sure what he did to earn one of the 3 treasons...

Many of you had questions about exactly how we went about making these banners. So I have put together a step by step guide as to how we did everything. As with all things, I am sure that there are better and different ways to do all of this. This is how we do it with what we have available.

##Part 1 The Supplies.

1.	Adobe Photoshop, or some sort of image editor

2.	Adobe Acrobat, or some sort of program that can tile/poster print large images. Adobe Reader doesnt support this function. :/

##Part 2 The Stencil.


1.	Find a good, large (1080p or greater), clean image with the sigil on it and save it to your hard drive. Something similar to [this](http://visionsoiaf.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/gateley-house-bolton.jpg) or [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6ioj-2viuHc/Tm6neS7zzEI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/av-SMAM7Wn8/s1600/wallpaper-greyjoy-1600.jpg)

2.	Go to File &gt; New

3.	Set the width to 50 inches and the height to 50 inches. This makes sure that we leave enough room so everything fits on the canvas. [Image](http://i.minus.com/i2gWjzhMrcr3v.png)

4.	Click OK.

5.	Add the image to the new document by dragging it from its location on your hard drive onto the Photoshop canvas. [Image](http://i.minus.com/i0FzkmIRzsZ87.png)

6.	Once the image has been added, the transform controls show up. While holding the Shift key (to maintain the aspect ratio) drag one corner of the image until it fills the entire document. [Image](http://i.minus.com/ibdiGR0BQ6yrXH.png)

7.	Confirm the changes up on the toolbar. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iCC0sHIvSZWs1.png)

8.	Using the Magic Wand tool, click on an area of the image that has the color that you want to select. Photoshop will then go and highlight all of that color that lies within the tolerance connected to the pixel that you clicked on. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iQHvL3DVc3bfn.png)

9.	If you clicked on the wrong area, just right click and select Deselect

10.	If not all of the color you needed was selected because of a gap between areas, right click and select Similar This will go find all of the areas similar to the one you clicked on. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iDOPUfyAsRJ8T.png) [Image](http://i.minus.com/iCYkTyS25lDwL.png)

11.	If Photoshop isnt selecting quite all of the color that you wanted, you can adjust the tolerance on the upper tool bar and try again.

12.	Create a new layer (Shift+Ctrl+N). [Image](http://i.minus.com/i5gS3eZNhT94k.png)

13.	Ensure that your new layer is selected over on the right. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iboMhuIATMdeQk.png)

14.	Select the brush tool and set your foreground color to white. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iw2GlVMjKrvc2.png)

15.	Increase the brush size. [Image](http://i.minus.com/i8NpR4axJuneW.png)

16.	With everything still selected on your image, paint over everything. This will only paint inside of selected areas onto our new, blank, layer. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iUSSdhzYy8jIW.png)

17.	Using the Magic Wand tool again, deselect all of the selected areas. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iosupgjonaZO9.png)

18.	Change your foreground brush color to black. 

19.	Using the Rectangle tool, draw a black rectangle over the entire canvas. [Image](http://i.minus.com/ibzIj6zstsZlg5.png)

20.	Then drag it so it fits below Layer 1 on the right.

21.	Now we can see our pretty stencil. [Image](http://i.minus.com/ibwl282uNnqzOp.png)

22.	Next, after moving our foreground color back to white, and re selecting Layer 1, using the brush and eraser tools, clean up the stencil. Remove extra areas, smooth out things that didnt come out quite right, fill in holes etc.

23.	Click the eye next to your black rectangle so it isnt shown anymore.

24.	Then right click on Layer 1, and select Blending Options. 

25.	Click on where it says Stroke on the left side. [Image](http://i.minus.com/ioEPcvmRYsDRU.png)

26.	Adjust the size to whatever you so desire, anywhere between 5-10 pixels is good. 

27.	And viola, a stencil. [Image](http://i.minus.com/iX3Q5LtM9Y1xm.png)

28.	Do a File &gt; Save As. Then change the file type to PDF. Save

29.	Open your stencil PDF in Adobe Acrobat.

30.	File &gt; Print

31.	Select Poster [Image](http://i.minus.com/ipYW5PamzrcDi.png)

32.	Print

For the words, its the exact same process from Step 17 on. Create a new document thats about 50 inches wide and 19 inches tall. Using the Text tool, add whatever text you want. I try to keep everything on two lines. It usually is easiest to create two different pieces of text than fiddling with putting a return in. The font we used is [Optimus Princeps Semi Bold](http://www.dafont.com/optimusprinceps.font) sized to somewhere around 700 or so. Change the font color to white, set the stroke in blending options, save as PDF, and print. Done.

##Part 3 The Painting.

1.	Run your canvas through a wash and dry cycle. After it comes out, iron it to get most of the wrinkles out. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/Z8wT9h.jpg)

2.	Tape the printed out stencil together. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/xf1VYh.jpg)

3.	Decide how you want to cut the stencil out. Either cut out the inside, or the outside. We have found that for sigils that have lots of non-connected pieces that cutting out the inside works best. This would be our approach for the above Greyjoy sigil, and like we did for the Baratheon one. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/FByOah.jpg) [Image](http://i.imgur.com/URlLEh.jpg)

4.	Start cutting out your stencil using an X-acto knife. Place a cutting board or something hard to make cutting everything out easier, and to save whatever surface is underneath.

5.	Once the stencil is cut out, place it on the canvas. Leave about 4 to 5 inches of room at the top so you can add grommets after its done to hang them on the wall. 

6.	Ensure that the stencil is centered and straight, this is the hard part. We accomplish this through many measurements and how it looks on the canvas. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/rNYsUh.jpg)

7.	After its centered and straight, put in a few pins to keep it from moving around during tracing.

8.	Using a Sharpie, trace the outline of your stencil onto the canvas. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/sGnBih.jpg)

9.	Remove the stencil.

10.	Place the canvas on the plastic sheet just in case there are any spills or bleed through. We havent had any trouble with this so far, but you never know.

11.	Stir and crack open your paint. 

12.	Grab a smaller brush and start carefully painting the outline [Image](http://i.imgur.com/ZTazFh.jpg)

13.	Once that is complete, using a larger brush (0.5 to 2 inches) fill in the larger areas. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/zrBSdh.jpg)

14.	Let dry.

15.	Repeat steps 11 and 12 until you reach the color you want. I think it has to do with paint quality, but our Lannister banner took 3 coats of gold to look right, but 
the Baratheon banner only took one.

16.	Once the sigil is painted and dry (we let ours sit overnight before starting the words) repeat steps 3 through 6 with the words. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/xWCBbh.jpg) [Image](http://i.imgur.com/ZXUHzh.jpg)

17.	Instead of tracing the letters with a sharpie, we use the paper as an actual stencil. Just painting directly onto the canvas and paper at the same time. This results in a few minor errors which look egregious up close, are hard to see from far away. You could sharpie trace it if you wanted, we just think its not worth the time. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/btV4Uh.jpg)

18.	Let dry. Apply more coats as needed.

19.	And youre done!

20.	To hang the banners on the wall, use a  inch grommet kit to put 4 evenly spaced holes in the top of the banner. We put them about 2 inches down from the top.

Why were the Lannisters such a larger presence in terms of guards and soliders in Kings Landing than the Baratheons? Where were all of Robert's men from Storm's End and the Stormlands? Even when Robert died, most people believed Joffery was a Baratheon, so why was their house so underrepresented compared to the Lannisters, or even Starks?

Also, I added the ACOK spoiler alert because obviously, most men sworn to the Baratheons went away to fight with Stannis, Renly, or even [ASOS](/b ""Beric Dondarrion""), so that would explain why there's a lack of them later. I was just curious about before the War of 5 Kings.

Now a lot of people say that the Faith of the Seven is the equivalent of Christianity but Personally I believe that this is not true but that in fact the religion of R'hllor is closest to Christianity and I have several reasons. 

**First** R'hllor is a Monotheistic like Christianity.

**Second** There is an Anti-God, if you will, called the Great Other who is the enemy of R'hllor, much like Christianity and the Devil.

**Third** There is a Messiah like figure Azor Ahai who sacrifices his Wife to save his people, albeit slightly different to Christianity but still rather similar. 

**Fourth** The Faith of R'hllor is a much more destructive faith then the Faith of the Seven with practitioners of R'hllor condemning other religions as false faiths. 

**Fifth** And finally the Priests of R'hllor burn people something that during the Medieval period Christians did to people that they considered Heathens. 

To me the Faith of the Seven is closer to Roman or Greek Religion which was willing to coexist with other religions and had separate gods for different aspects of life.

So this is my belief feel free to make voice your own opinions and let me know if you think that you have a better idea for comparisons.",25,12,False,self,,,,,

So I just finished ASOS.
Cat is still alive? ""She don't speak...but she still remembers."" That line sent chills down my spine.
""Lord Tywin Lannister, in the end, did not shit gold."" That could possibly be my favorite line from the entire series so far. 

The events of the Red Wedding! Joffreys Wedding! Jon Snows events at the wall! Everything in book 1 and 2 has been leading to the last 400 or so pages of book 3. There is so much flooding through my head right now, I am having trouble trying to keep these sentences cohesive. Never has a book sunken its teeth into me quite like ASOIAF. 

My favorite fact I learned shortly before reading book 3, was that the series ASOIAF was only meant to be a trilogy, but after the stir this book created upon release G.R.R. decided to expand it.
I thought ASOS did a good job of ""wrapping up"" the trilogy (If it were to be the final book) but they definitely left a lot of loose ends that I would have been displeased about if G.R.R. had decided not to continue.


--Again, i'm sorry if my typing is messed up, and my sentences are fragmented and disorganized, I have more thoughts flowing through my head right now than I can focus on. If anybody wants to discuss book 3 with me in this thread though, I would be happy to hold discussion.

Once we were grown from saplings, thin veins of white and red,

Now Pillars of ivory, we stand, our tenders long since dead,

We spread our fingers through the dark, our faces worn away,

The tears of blood still flow from us, the few that still remain.



Once northern men, they held us high, as gods among the wood,

Now only scattered ashes blow, where our closest family stood,

Their gods of fire and seven sides would tear us from our place, 

But our tears of blood still pour like rain, from a frigid, somber face.




Once Aegon came with dragons here, to tame a wild land,

Now dragon fire again shall flare, and burn beast as like as man,

We saw men battle many times, wars painful, long and cruel,

But our tears of blood still well up red, and in our eyes they pool.



Once children of the forest climbed among our branches high,

Now men have slaughtered all but few, and left the rest to die,

 Their blades of iron drove them north, to hide beneath a hill,

With tears of blood we weep for them, an ocean left to fill.



Once men of ice, they spoke with us, saw stories through our eyes,

Now heathen gods condemn us, and deem our memories lies,

And only a single remains who speaks, more like we trees than men,

His tears of blood drip to our roots, and red they dye his skin



A darker time has come for us, and our time left here is short,

But from the south, he comes to us, a seer and a warg,

With body weak and soul aflame, he shall claim the whitewood throne,

And the  bloody tears that ever flow shall mingle with his own.

1.) Anytime someone says ""Winter is coming"", *finish your drink.* 

2.) Anytime someone refers to Jon Snow as a bastard, take a drink.

3.) Anytime Tyrian is called ""The Imp"", take a drink.

4.) When someone is beheaded, *finish your drink.* 

5.) When a couple is shown having sex, or there are boobs on screen, you have to keep drinking until they're done, or covered.

6.) Anytime Joffery enters the scene, the first person to call him a ""little shit"" can have anyone in the room finish their drink.

I noticed something though towards the end of season two. So Theon Greyjoy takes over Winterfell and claims it. 500 Stark men show up to reclaim it. So he gives his speech to his 20 or so soldiers and they knock him out and say, ""Lets go home."" Later Bran and his brother along with the other two and see that Winterfell has been set on fire and have to leave the city.

What I didn't get was how did the Men of the Iron Islands leave winterfell without getting in contact with 500 stark men? Not only that, how did they manage to set winterfell on fire and then leave. You think the stark men would stop the fire. When Bran leaves there are no men outside the city. Can someone explain this to me?

As a new subscriber to this subreddit (and a recent discoverer of GoT) I was hoping that someone might be willing to point me in the direction of an online link where I can watch Game of Thrones. 
For the record, I've known about the series for years, but never bothered to read the books; I was, admittedly, a bit biased towards George R.R. Martin for certain personal reasons that were, in retrospect, pretty ignorant.
In any event, my brother lent me a flash drive that had a few movies on it, but I also discovered after perusing the root directory, several episodes of the HBO series, Game of Thrones.
Sadly, they were out of order and there were only 5 to begin with but I watched them anyway and before I knew it, I was hooked!
Unfortunately, I don't have HBO (or a lot of money in general -laid off presently) and I don't know anyone with the series (thus far) on DVD.
So my real question is basically whether anyone here can recommend a decent place to watch these online for little to no money?
I suppose I could do my own investigation, but before I do I thought I'd toss the question out there to you guys.
Any leads would be welcomed as I'd love to figure out what in the heck is going on (or has gone on/has yet to happen) from where I started watching.",3,0,False,default,,,,,

Also, the 3 leeches - this is probably the most significant part of the Stannis/Davos arc of season 3, and since Balon (at least he is supposed to) dies before the RW, and the RW is confirmed for episode 9, then why leave the one king left?

How about my man, Lord Beric Dondarrion?! Thoros of Myr and Lord Beric have been adding more and more of the fantasy aspect to this story, but I cannot complain. The last scene in ASOS when Catelyn is seemingly revitalized, and gives the okay to partially avenge Robb by killing one of the lesser Freys, was a twist that I never saw coming.

The reason for this is that apparently she was pregnant with Robb (duh) and because of that she was hidden with Blackfish at Riverrun, and escaped from there with him.
The base of this theory is given by a comparison between two different dialogues, first Catelyn in the 3rd book:

""Thin, but with good hips, Catelyn noted. At least should not have trouble having children.""

Now check the characteristics given by Jaime on the 4th book, after the Red Wedding:

''She did not seem dangerous. Jeyne was a thin girl with no more than fifteen or sixteen, more awkward than graceful. Had STRAITS hips, breast size apple...''

The Red Wedding was 299DP, and the Siege of Riverrun was 300DP. So if she was pregnant, she must have had chid before escaping from Riverrun with Blackfish.

But this year thing it's not official so many still speculate that Jeyne was pregnant when they escaped. 

And then the mother of Jeyne, Sybell Westerling, had no choice but to change Jeyne by her sister. Sybell said to them that Jeyne (At this point Elenya) took the tea-of-moon*  so the Lannister wouldn't be mad.


*This theory was made originally in portuguese so I translated it and I don't know for sure if the expression I used here are the same in the american book. Sorry about that and about possible mistakes.

The wonderful ""Seven Devils"" full length trailer for season 2 appeared online a year ago tomorrow (January 30, 2012).  Hopefully we will see something similar for season 3 soon calm our nerves as we wait.  Until then, why not pass the time delving into some details?  The show is a new medium, and while the books have plenty of hints and foreshadowing of things that have transpired by the end of *A Dance with Dragons* (as well as some that hint at things that might happen but have not yet), the show can do it different; visuals, lines, dialogue, a glance between characters, a costuming choice, an editing choice...the new medium means new ways of expression, and that means new ways for the showrunners to tell us in a subtle way what is to come.  


**F**or instance, while Reek/Ramsay is its own entire plotline in *A Clash of Kings*, the series had to remove (or perhaps move/abridge/alter?) that subplot.  In its place is Lord Bolton's calm and chilling voice telling Robb that his bastard at the Dreadfort could handle Theon.  For us book readers, that fills us with both joy and hate (joy at the pleasure of the intense Ramsay storyline and character, hate because he's so awful), and likely even those who have not read the books had their interest piqued.  ""Dreadfort?  Wait...*DREAD*fort?!  What's this about?!""


**S**o, are there any other hints and clues and bits of foreshadowing that the show does for things that have already happened (like, Eddard's death, or the sacking of Winterfell, etc.), things that will happen (like Ramsay's torture of Theon), or things that might happen (R+L=J?) that you particularly enjoy?",71,18,False,self,,,,,

Also, I just started reading the first book, and I'm about 200 pages in, if that makes a difference. 

With that being said, I would like to explain my Jon Snow Theory.

We all know King Robert loved Eddard's sister Lyanna. We also know he despises the Targaryens and wishes to see them all dead. Now let's back up and take a look at what is we know about Lyanna. 

* She was married or captive of Rhaegar, which Rob makes clear when talking to Eddard, ""...how many time doe you think he raped your sister? How many *hundreds* of times?

So we can assume based of the nature of men, than Rhaegar did in fact have sex with Lyanna, probably numerous times. Now I hate make assumptions, but I feel this one is justifiable. 

So this brings up to Eddard. We know Eddard to be respectful, honorable. Man. Do we really think Eddard would break his marriage vows for a single night of pleasure? Furthermore, he refuses to speak of this woman with whom he slept with, who we know by the name of ""Wylla"". Even when pressed for information by his best friend and his king, Eddard refuses to talk about her, and tells Rob to never bring it up again. 

I believe, that Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. Making him a Targaryen. I don't think Lyanna's last words to Eddard were to bring her body back to Winterfell, but to protect her newly born son, Jon. 

Like I stated earlier, king Rob hates the Targaryens, and wishes to see them all dead. So if he were to learn about Jon Snow's true father, he would have him executed. So in order to protect his sister's child, he took upon the shame of an adulterer and claimed Jon to be his bastard child. It was his sister's final request, and Eddard is willing to sacrifice his own honor to protect that final wish. 

TL;DR:
Jon Snow is a Targaryen. 

If this is reviled in later book, I apologize, I haven't read them yet. I'm also curious to see what other's think of my theory. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong if you think so, no hurt feeling will be had.

I'm a blacksmith and recently was introduced to the Game of Thrones series. I watched both seasons in the space of about a week and I have to admit, I like it a lot. Seems to be one of the best things to watch right now.
Recently, I've been making arrowheads for some medieval reenactor clients of mine and I got to thinking; since each kingdom has it's own style, what kind of arrowheads would each one use? It's purely subjective of course.
So, I came up with these;
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Mvf1Dii)

Each one represents one of the 7 independent kingdoms prior to the conquest. Those being;  The North, Iron Islands, the Vale, The Westerlands, The Reach, the Stormlands and Dorne.
Fun game, try and guess which arrowhead represents which kingdom.

P.S. the guys over at /blacksmith thought you guys would appreciate this.

Sorry but do people normally downvote such posts? Over at /blacksmith we don't get much downvoting. It's a pretty gentlemanly subreddit and the trolls tend to stay away.

In page 6 of a Clash of Kings Patchface says when with Cressen and Shireen ""The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord, The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord."""" Does this perhaps tell us that Patchface knows more about Melisandre then any of us? Shireen even says that when Patchface sings that it scares her. Then later on he seems to perfectly predict the Red Wedding when he says """"Fool's blood, king's blood, blood on the maiden's thigh, but chains for the guests and chains for the bridegroom, aye aye aye."" The fools blood is from the fool Cat kills after Rob is killed, who is undoubtedly the ""Kings Blood"", blood on the maiden's thigh is after Edmure's wife's maidenhead was broken, and many were taken in chains, such as the Greatjon and Edmure. Perhaps he will play a bigger role in future books?

So, if Jon is Lyanna and Rhaegar's son, he has both Stark and Targaryen blood. We already know he is a skinchanger because of his relationship with Ghost.

Danaerys has a really close relationship with her dragons, which makes me think that this is a result of her Targaryen blood.

So, do you think that Jon could learn to warg into the Dragons, because he is in the unique position of having blood from both sides.

Even if this is crazy talk, it would be cool as hell.

In the first book, Snow decides not to ride south to avenge his father's death, and again, when Stannis offers him Winterfell, he chooses to stay on the Wall. That's like, the whole point of his character arc: that he's a bastard, hated and scorned his whole life, yet in the end, he honors his father's name and upholds the vows he takes, even when it's hard, even when it costs him.

He says that Jon Snow is actually a Targaryen, as he believes that Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark actually secretly had a child somehow (not known if voluntary or not) and when that child was born Eddard was given the child  to look after (as they couldn't keep the child as their own) under the ruse that it was his bastard son, with only him, Lyanna and Rhaegar knowing. This would explain why Ned held his supposed bastard in such high regard and proximity to the rest of the family, and one of the last things Eddard said to Jon was 'When i get back we'll talk about your mother', meaning it might not be so simple as we all thought, And with Neds death that means the secret might have gone to the grave with him. As for trying to burn his body after his essential death in ADWD i think he might not be true no fire pain Targaryen, like Viserys, as he was killed by the gold crown .
