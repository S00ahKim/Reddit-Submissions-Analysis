Jamie has released Edmure so that he is now the Lord of Riverrun in an attempt to end the siege peacefully. He has one of the Frey musicians play for him as he baths etc when the following happens...

""I'll leave you to enjoy your food. Singer play for our guests whilst he eats. You know the son, I trust.""

""The one about the rain? Aye, my lord. I know it."" 

Edmure seemed to see the man for the first time. ""No. Not him. Get him away rom me.""

Now obviously the song is the Rain of Castamere, but who is the singer that Edmure seems to hate. 

I can only assume he was part of the red wedding but I can't remember any particular musician standing out as being the biggest dick. 

Only a small detail I know but it'll eat away at me. I love how GRRM keeps these little details coming up every now and then and always spend ages trying to remember them when I can't.

Check it out, I don't know anyone who doesn't enjoy it. Regardless, these guys working on the mod are doing phenomenal work, however they are in need of original artwork. I imagine anybody familiar with coding could help as well, so just contact one of the moderators. I am, of course, talentless, so I have nothing to offer in the ways of completion so I just sit and wait with bated breath. Go check it out and see what you guys think of the work they've completed thus far and donate some time to this phenomenal project.

From reading the books we come to understand that Jeor Mormont abdicated his seat in favour of his son, Ser Jorah Mormont and then joined the Nights Watch.

I don't think we're given a time frame of when he did this so my question to you guys is; ""Why would he have done this?  Did he do something that made him have to join the Nights Watch?""

My kind of theory is if this happened around the same time as the Greyjoy rebellion, when Jorah won his Knighthood for being the 2nd person through the breached walls and fighting well, did Jeor see this and think it's time to pass my lordship over?",14,5,False,self,,,,,

I have a forge, a welder and all the usual metalworking bits and pieces- what do you think would make a good case mod? I was thinking of having the side panels as shields, with the sigils of House Baratheon or House Stark cut out of the wood to form the window, with the rest of the shield painted the appropriate colours and aged and with the words of the house painted on. I was thinking perhaps forging a couple of blades to act as the base, but that could look tacky. Perhaps the base could be done in the style of the Iron Throne...

I've been reading them on and off since January and i just finished the epiloge during my lunchbreak.

All the deaths of the characters i've invested time and love in, and even the characters i haven't is just heartbreaking. My affection for these books started with Brans fall and it has been an emotional rollercoaster. I got really bummed out when Ned died, same with Robb and Catelyn. When i heard that they killed Grey Wind i became sad. But when Ygritte died i cried (manly tears), her death was so unnecessary. The supposed death of Jon Snow wasn't really a surprise but after that suddenly Kevan gets a crossbow bolt in the stomach by VARYS of all people, Varys, the man, my favorite character, killed (together with the children) the man in the background. The one who was never really appreciated, Kevan Lannister.  

These books will always have a special place in my heart. GRRM has made my last 7ish months a true adventure and i couldn't thank him enough. Now it's time to finally open the gates to the forbidden realm of r/ASoIaF and wait for TWoW with everyone else.

Seems like this kind of honor is at least a little different from what is considered honorable in the Southron kingdoms.  For example; in the North, the man passing a sentence is expected to carry it out himself, it's still a great honor to serve on the Wall, a man has a right to vengeance, willingness to lay down your own life for your duty, etc. Honorable men in the North are dudes like Ned Stark, Jeor Mormont, Rodrick Cassel.

In the South, they have their own flavor of honor or Chivalry, which sounds like mostly the kind of thing that Sansa thinks a knight ought to do.  They seem to have more emphasis on protecting the weak, defenseless, innocent, maidens, and an piety to the Seven.  Honorable Southroners seem to be Barristan Selmy, Edmure Tully and The Blackfish.

There are of course lots of things that both areas agree are honorable, keeping oaths probably being the most important (even if almost nobody does).  Not killing POWs also seems honorable, but it might also just be good strategy; it's easier to get them off the battlefield if they believe they will survive their captivity.

My question is, do the rest of you think there is such a distinction between the values of North vs South?  Are there more distinctions than this?  More similarities?",21,20,False,self,,,,,

I watched both seasons of Game of Thrones before I started reading the books, so I know what to expect in terms of plot.

I just finished reading the chapter when Renly dies. It was awesome, and I liked it more than how it happened in the show. Obviously, what happened will be explained, and I don't know how it will be explained and if it will be any different than what happened in the show, again, I literally just finished the chapter. 

But if the same thing happens, with Davos and Melisandre, why didn't GRRM write that as a Davos chapter before Renly died? There have only been one or two chapters from Davos' perspective in the book and they are so few and far between that having another chapter would have made sense. 

I am just trying to think of what that would have been like, without knowing it was about to happen. Don't get me wrong, I prefer the books and I'm positive the explanation will be incredible. 

I feel like I'm having a hard time wording this, without sounding like I'm hating on the book. But I'm not! So please, ask me what I mean if you don't get what I'm saying and I'll try to explain better. I just don't really get what happened there!

**The Things I Do For Love**

by: Trustedsource

Cersei moaned with ecstasy as Jaime plunged inside her once again. Her fingers tightened on his boiled leather garments which had been piled on the floor as a cushion for Cersei's hands and knees. After an evening of bickering with foreign dignitaries and comporting herself gracefully despite the near constant slights she had been made to suffer, she had stolen away to find release in her brother's arms. It was fucking sweet.

Suddenly the door to the chamber burst open to reveal Tyrion standing in the doorway. He was clad fully in boiled leather with a devilish grin on his face. In less than a second he tore his garments off his body. Baring his erect penis and throwing his arms into the air he shouted, "" Sibling threesome!"" in a sardonic tone. He ran at Cersei, lance forward, with all the swiftness he could muster. ""No, NO!"" Cersei shouted but it was already too late. Tyrion dick-planted in Cersei's mouth with enough force to rock Jaime backward. He recovered from his shock, and after surveying the situation shrugged and decided to keep going.

The two brothers thrusted back and forth from either side with the synchronous rhythm of a pair of Karstark lumberjacks operating a two man saw. They thrusted and high-fived over Cersei's supine form for what seemed like hours until Tyrion noticed a scroll wrapped in boiled leather on the floor next to his leg. He picked it up and read it. It was a letter promising Tyrion's betrothal to Lord Mace Tyrell's younger brother. Jaime had gotten their father to sign it and apply the Lannister seal.

Tyrion looked at Jaime, astonished. ""But I don't want to marry lord Tyrell..."" Tyrion murmured. 

Jaime smiled and grasped Tyrion's face in one hand. ""My dear brother, I would let Mace Tyrell's whole House fuck you. All 40,000 men and their horses too if that's what it took to get Loras Tyrell's autograph."" 

Tyrion was agape. ""It is known..."" he whispered with tears welling in his eyes but before they had a chance to fall, Tyrion pulled out of Cersei's mouth and blasted all over her face as Jaime did likewise behind her. Cersei did a boiled-leather-barrel roll to escape the spray. Tyrion and Jaime locked jizz with one another. Each one's spray overpowering the other and being over-powered in turn. Finally Jaime's almighty foam-fountain proved too much for Tyrion and launched the dwarf across the room, slamming the door shut beneath his weight. The room filled impossibly quickly with Lannister seed and all three siblings found themselves unable to keep their heads above the milky torrent. 

Lord Tywin Lannister awoke with a start. *What a gay dream,* he thought to himself. He pushed his boiled leather covers aside and sat up, surveying the room. After a few moments, he pulled the covers back up and rolled over. *No worse than every other night, I suppose.* Tywin thought as he drifted slowly back to sleep.

Then a main character died.

I don't get it. One season of the show has 10 episodes, each one almost an hour long.

**MAJOR ASOS SPOILERS BELOW**

Here's the list of all the memorable (memorable, because I'm writing this from memory) events in ASOS:

- Dany on a ship, Jorah kisses her

- Cat hangs out at Riverrun, Karstarks are killed, Lord Hoster goes insane and dies

- Dany arrives at Astapor, does the little trick with the Unsullied, takes the city

- Jon is 'accepted' by Mance, later he bangs Ygritte

- Sam kills an Other

- Sansa and Tyrion get married

- in the meantime, pretty much nothing happens to Bran and Arya

- Jaime and Brienne get caught, Jaime gets his hand chopped off

- The Hound and Beric Dondarrion have their little duel

- Jon and the wildlings climb over the Wall

- the little massacre at Craster's Keep takes place

- Jon escapes the wildlings and goes to the Wall

- Dany conquers Yunkai

- Arya gets captured by the Hound and begins travelling with him

- Jaime goes back to Harrenhal and rescues Brienne

- Robb names Jon Snow his heir

- Coldhands makes his appearance

- RED WEDDING, Sandor and Arya witness it

- the Night's Watch defends Castle Black from a wildling attack, Ygritte dies

- Sam meets Bran and takes him to meet Coldhands

- Arstan reveals his true identity

- Joffrey dies at his wedding, Tyrion gets arrested

- Dontos takes Sansa and delivers her to Littlefinger

- Jaime returns to King's Landing

- Davos saves Edric

- Jon takes command of the Night's Watch

- Littlefinger takes Sansa to the Fingers and marries Lysa

- Janos Slynt arrives on the Wall and calls Jon a traitor; forces him to go to Mance, where the Stannis's attack takes place

- Gregor Clegane kills Oberyn Martell in combat

- Daenerys banishes Jorah and decides to stay in Meereen

He's obviously the rightful heir to the Iron Throne following Robert's death (barring Targaryens, that is).  However, I feel the picture of him as this impartially just man is exaggerated, if not totally inaccurate.  He committed infidelity, for one thing, in fucking Melissandre, and in addition (or, as a result), murdered his brother.  It's frequently mentioned throughout the series that there is pretty much nothing you can do that would be worse than kinslaying.  So he's an oathbreaker and a murderer and he doesn't appear to have much respect for the vows of the Night's Watch either.  

Not that Stannis isn't a badass; he is.  I'm just trying to understand why he's considered such an obvious bastion of character and integrity.  I've tagged All Spoilers because where he is or isn't at the end of ADWD may be relevant.  Help me out.",42,16,False,self,,,,,

Spoilers! [ADWD]

This theory is predicated on the idea that Aegon *is* the ""mummer's dragon"" that was prophesied. Logically, he is then unlikely to be a true Targaryen, just one that looks and acts like a Targ enough to retake the Iron Throne. House Dayne is repeatedly noted to share many Targaryen features due to both houses' roots extending to Old Valyria, other than similar looks though, they are entirely unrelated; they are literally a mummer's version of House Targaryen, aka the dragon.

Now bear with me because another theory sets up the second half of Aegon and Lemore. Regardless of Egg's true identity, I see a problem with the Golden Company, namely why did Myles Toyne agree to help restore a Targaryen (the family responsible for brutally dismembering his ancestor Terrence, as well as just generally shitting on and fueding with the Toyne's for years) to the Iron Throne? How much gold would it take to make Myles forget the 100+ years of bad blood between Targ and Toyne?

Here's where the speculation comes in: Aegon's mother was a Dayne, which one I'm not sure, but this is where he gets his Targaryen Lite hair, eyes, etc... His father was Simon Toyne, Myles' brother. GRRM alludes that Myles' ogre face is unusual for a Toyne, especially given Terrence's legendary looks, implying Simon was likely more handsome than brother Myles. The Kingswood Brotherhood, which Simon founded, gained notoriety for kidnapping nobles and considering Arthur Dayne was on the Kingsguard, it's not unlikely his sisters would have visited him at court.

The timing of it all works out fairly well too, Aegon was supposedly born in 282 and Simon died in 281, 9 month pregnancy and margin of error in backtracking our best guess of Aegon's age. Either Lemore is Aegon's mother or she is his aunt (Ashara/Allyria could both fill either role). Myles Toyne agreed to put his brother's son on the Iron Throne with Varys/Illyrio's help and Lemore/JonCon's teachings. Connington knows none of this and genuinely believes Aegon to be Targaryen, he wouldn't have gone along with it otherwise.

I think I'm probably against the current here, but I really start to dislike the frontpage of this subreddit on a daily basis.

I know, there are no active episodes currently, so show-related content is pretty thin, but I'd rather have a FEW relevant threads discussing about the show, about the cast, about sets and locations, about Viewers-only theories. I also like to read people speculations about the future of the story (in the book or in the show), I enjoy reading readers reactions.

But another Jon Snow / Daenerys drawing ? GOT Coffee cup ? Brand new GOT Tshirt ? Khaleesi cosplays ? These were nice 1 year ago, now its just incredibly boring (to me). There MUST be some kind of compromise here. Just this morning its too much. I mean look the front page, and check how many drawings/paintings/goodies and stuff. 

I know, /r/asoiaf is here too, I subscribed to it too, and its a fine subreddit, but its more... ""elitist"" for a lack of better word. I like /r/got because its more fun, more casual, but I really dislike where its heading.

Of all the ""what ifs"" that this series could have, I think John Snow is one of the biggest variables. So the question...

**What if John Snow had gone with his Lord Father, instead of going to the wall?**

When Eddard Stark departed for King's Landing, there is no way John could have stayed behind in Winterfell, Lady Stark would not have had it. If he didn't feel the urge to go to the wall (and if Benjen hadn't joined the feast, maybe he wouldn't have seriously thought about it), he would have had to go with his father. So I guess that splits the discussion into two parts. 

*What changes would have happened up at the wall without John, and what changes would have happened down in Kings's Landing with John?*

As most of you guys have noticed, we've removed a few threads lately consisting of actor/actress photos.

[And as some of you have correctly guessed](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/zic8t/look_who_i_met_on_his_way_to_college/c64urgl), it's because of constant sexual comments.

So let this be a reminder, for those of you who missed the thread we made a couple months back, the posting policy states:

&gt;Don't sexually objectify the actors, characters, or redditors, no matter their age or sex

Violators of this policy will be **instabanned**. We've tried several methods of communication with the community about this, but nothing's been effective. Since instating the instaban policy, things have gotten much better, but lately these comments have been on the upswing.

These bans are **not permanent** unless we find reason to make it so. Most of the time, folks will message the mods apologizing and we let it slide. But, we never let it slide more than once. Once you've been banned, we all RES tag you. It's kind of like our sex offenders list :) If it comes up again, we permaban.

So this is the heads up. That rule still exists. There are ramifications. We do not unban twice.

***Please upvote this for visibility. It is a self-post and I receive no Karma for it.***

Much love from your mod staff

This is only the case with RES enabled, however it only happens on this subreddit. The issue is consistent, refreshing the posts or coming back to them later causes the exact same issue, blanking out the same posts at the same point in the scroll.

This is most likely an issue for the RES developers, but I thought it was worth finding out it anyone else experienced it here as this is the only subreddit I've encountered it on and it happens frequently.

Here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/mnZwY.jpg).

Anyone else run into this?

**Technical Details**

The disappearing sections are the divs with the .collapsed and .noncollapsed classes assigned. Analysing in Firebug shows no changes to the HTML or CSS when this happens.

Hovering over the ""parent"" link on any of the missing posts (moving my mouse around until I find it), causes the normal popup to appear and reveals all of the previously hidden posts, until the cursor leaves the link. If I try to select content while it's hidden it won't show up, however if I then hover over the parent link, the text will be selected when it shows up.

EDIT: As mentioned in the comments, disabling the /r/gameofthrones custom theme fixes the issue, but it's a shame to lose such a well crafted theme.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

* I read the theory that Aegon (Young Griff from ADWD) was actually a Blackfyre pretender.  I definitely think this is the case after reading the Tales of Dunk and Egg.  The focus of these three stories really seems to be the affect the Blackfyre rebellion had on the realm and I think it would be cool for ASoIaF to still be feeling it nearly 100 years later
* Bloodraven is a very intriguing character and I hope that the three eyed crow is actually him
* My own conjecture and wishes: I hope the tragedy of summerhall is somehow more complicated than it appears and perhaps Dunk &amp; Egg faked their deaths for some reason.

So Valyria was this huge nation, equivalent to the Roman Republic according to Martin, with its power based on tamed dragons. Despite having tons and tons of territory, all the dragons and elite Valyrians were killed in the Doom except for the Targaryens. 

From all descriptions, the Doom would seem to be a volcanic event, and the current uninhabitable state of Valyria would be due to continuing release of potent toxic volcanic gases. I suppose this could be possible, seeing as it happened only four centuries prior to the story.

But what kind of volcanic event would kill dragons? They seem to be able to withstand ridiculous amounts of heat, considering that their flesh will melt iron. And further, they can fly, so...how exactly would a volcanic event kill all of them? I was thinking that it's more likely that the dragons would still be alive, and it's just that all the elite Valyrians who had tamed them are dead. But why wouldn't the Valyrians have escaped on the dragons?

Most of the old Valyrian homeland also appears to have sunken beneath the sea, which is strange - what sort of volcanic event would have that sort of effect on that sort of scale? I was thinking it could be that the Valyrian lands were atop a gigantic underground pocket of toxic volcanic gases, and the Doom was that the pocket burst, causing the landmass to sink into the empty space quite cataclysmically. This would also release huge amounts of toxic gases. I could see the cause of the pocket's bursting being that the Valyrians mined too deeply in search of more dragon eggs.

Yet such an event would have had effects across the world, and there's no mention of any sort of volcanic winters. Although I suppose with the seasons being as they are, it might not have been noticed as unusual or correlated with the Doom. 

TL;DR: The Doom was supposedly volcanic, but how would that kill all the dragons, and how would that make Valyria uninhabitable 400 years later?

EDIT: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria has a good summary of what's known about the events. According to the books, there were just crazy amounts of volcanic eruptions everywhere. But how did they all erupt at the same time? It would have to be that there were networks of magma pools just below the surface nearly everywhere in Valyria, and they were all connected to some source that caused them all to erupt at the same time. I don't know what exactly could do this, though. Maybe there's some sort of being underground? It's said that the eruption killed all the dragons, but...how does anyone know this? Everyone who was there was killed, since if any people survived, a dragon surely could have. So maybe the dragons weren't killed, and instead they went underground...maybe back to where they came from.",67,15,False,self,,,,,

Since then, David Peterson, creator of the language, has tweeted his support for the project.

TLDR: I would like to learn dothraki. I propose that we ask livemocha.com to add the language to their recognised list and allow us to put together a beginners course to dothraki using the existing dothraki dictionary and other online resources.


Like many of you here I was astounded, impressed, and intrigued when I learned that a real dothraki language was created for the tv show. And, I'm sure also like many of you, I was interested in learning a bit of the language just for a bit of interesting geek fun. The problem is, I'm not very good at just reading text on a site and retaining the information, nor will I be engaged enough to return to that site. What do work for me are interactive language learning sites that incorporate audio, visual, quizzes, and other forms of interaction that make the process more interesting and provides motivation for continuing on.
Some of you may be familiar with the website http://www.livemocha.com The site is good for learning vocabulary in an interactive way. It also allows users to put together courses of all levels for their own native tongue. I've been helping on and off to translate an Irish language course for beginners. What I think would be a good idea and good resource would be if we asked livemocha to include dothraki as a language on the site and allow us to build a course that will enable anyone to learn dothraki. We can translate ourselves and upvote submissions based on their accuracy and quality.
There is a templated format for each language, so it would be feasible to translate the existing flashcards into dothraki without being fluent in it. We have a very good wiki and dictionary as a starting point.
I'm rambling a bit, but why not check out the site for yourself and see how it would be a cool resource to have for dothraki (and also for the preservation of minority languages). http://www.livemocha.com/translations

Varys seems a lot easier to understand. He uses kids to spy on anyone and everyone. And his motivation seems clear at this point: bring the Targaryens back to power. Except it isn't just by right, he is sure Aegon has learned enough to be a great ruler. Right now he is trying to bring strife to the Lannister rule until the people rise up against them. He seems to want a peaceful kingdom. 

It seems Varys was playing some game with Aerys as well. Apparently he was whispering in his ear that Rhaegar was conspiring against him. This is confusing to me because by all accounts (except one) Aerys was mad and Rhaegar was a great guy. Maybe Varys saw what the Lyanna thing was going to do to the kingdom? A mad king might be less damaging than a war. Not sure about this though.


Littlefinger is a lot tougher to figure out. At this point the only thing we know is that he wants to nail Sansa because of his infatuation with her mother.

To usurp Aerys? It would seem that raping and pillaging the city in the name of the man you seek to place on the throne isn't exactly the best way to unite those people to his cause. If Rhaegar was dead (which he was at this point) and Aerys truly was unfit to rule, why would Tywin feel the need to set his men loose on King's Landing? Was it just a typical act of war? It seems that Tywin is always ready to set loose his band of rapists and murderers on the small-folk of westeros.

EDIT: I realize that Tywin has a propensity towards brutality, but that's typically to prevent rebellion and ensure his own order. Sacking Kings Landing seems to accomplish neither of these; the people defending and inhabiting kings landing couldn't logically be expected to forgo their fealty and their lawful king, and furthermore, a population quick to turn on their monarch isn't really beneficial to the ""King's Peace"" either.",22,6,False,self,,,,,

in the GoT series i am only up to the second book so if possible don't spoil anything beyond that to badly.

On page 402 Jojen Reed was talking about Bran's dreams. He says ""you were sitting at supper, but instead of a servant Master Luwin brought you your (special occasion?). He served you the king's cut of he roast, meat rare and bloody, but with a savory smell and made everyone's mouth water. The meat he served the Freys was old and grey and dead. Yet they liked their supper better than you liked yours""

As we know his dreams were coming true (or are) so this will probably happen. Am I right to think that this is saying Robb Stark will die so Bran will get his cut of the meat and have Luwin deliver it to him because it is a special occasion (Robb's death). He does not like it more then the Frey's because his brother just died and the kings cut reminds him of Robb.

Is this a hint saying that Robb will die?

The war that started with this death helped Littlefinger raising himself to Lord Paramount of The Trident, then Lord Protector of the Vale, and finally gives him a shot with the North with the help of the ''Queen of the North'', Sansa Stark.

But there's a flaw in his game, what happens if Sansa or any other Stark discovers that Littlefinger orchestred the death of their father specially with Sansa as ''apprentice'' of Littlefinger?

But I feel that there may be fans of the show who are in the same situation.]

Tired of waiting to see what happens in Season 3? Wondering where to start in the books? 

Here's where to start: **the beginning**.

By glancing through the first few chapters of A Storm of Swords, you'll probably recognize some of the events going on. That's due to the overlap between the last few episodes of season two and the early chapters of the third book. 

A few examples: [Season 2](/s ""Jaime begins his great canoe adventure with Brienne, Tyrion wakes up after taking a sword to the face during the siege of King's Landing, Margaery is betrothed to Joffrey, and Jon is a wildling captive."")

**However**, you have to realize that by switching from the TV series to the books, you've gone from somewhat detailed Cliff Notes to the full, unabridged version. It won't be a smooth transition. There will be entirely new characters. You'll be like, ""When did they get here?"" There will be references to past events you've never heard of. You'll be retracing through the pages, wondering if you missed something.

Some of these new characters are still waiting to be introduced in the television series; other parts will be, or have been, left out of the show entirely. 

I would have to strongly, strongly suggest that you go back to the beginning and reeducate yourself.

Yes, I know. I *know*. Picking up Game of Thrones might feel like a huge step back, but it is worth the pay-off. There's more to this series that you already love! Plus, you seriously have loads of time to catch up, and even get ahead, before the television series returns in late March.

**TL;DR**: Enjoy this series to its fullest, don't screw yourself by dabbling here and there and skipping around.",115,260,False,self,,,,,

However, there is undoubtedly someone that will read this post that is a master cosplay veteran and will be able to help me out.

I'm looking to be a man of the night's watch, and I have no idea how to do it. I was looking at ideas to be a roman centurion when I stumbled across [this](http://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Training-Polypropylene-Handle/dp/B001Q72ARC/ref=sr_1_4?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347470131&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=gladius) and thought it would make a pretty awesome piece to a night's watch costume. 

After searching the internet for an eternity (like half an hour) I came up with nothing to help me complete it, except some way-too-expensive chainmail. 

So, /r/gameofthrones, can you help make an affordable night's watch costume that anyone on here can make/buy? Things I think it still needs: ""Boiled Leather"" chest, long sleeved loose knee length shirt, leather gloves, ""fur"" cloak/shoulders, ""fur"" boots, and a scabbard.

PS: I'm a size XL.

tl;dr Help me make a night's watch/Jon Snow costume. kthx

I then started to theorize about how the show will handle her betrayal at Tyrion's trial. I personally think It would work pretty well if they have a scene of Shae being threatened by Tywin (and maybe even raped by him which would make Tyrion discovering in his bed more understandable for show-only viewers) to testify against Tyrion and then have the trial scene. I think knowing that Shae was not betraying Tyrion for such a simply for the wealth would make it all the more tragic when Tyrion kills her not knowing the truth.,8,0,False,self,,,,,

Anyways, while watching the second episode I came up with 2 minor questions regarding Jon Snow.

1. Will I ever read or see about Jon Snow's mother? Only a yes or no, I just want to know if I will, no spoilers please!
2. Why is it that Catelyn hates Jon Snow so much? I know Jon's a bastard and that Ned kinda left his honor that time, but after 14 years, shouldn't Catelyn have put the anger aside her? And why would it only be Jon she's mad at, why not Ned? Just something I don't really understand.

I didn't put spoiler tags in this, as I don't consider this spoilers. If you are even a little bit into GoT you should know these things I guess. But if people think otherwise, let me know :)

I'll list some things that might happen, give your opinion, and feel free to leave your own theory for the wolves.

* Sansa: Will wed the heir of the Veil, with those armies will take the North from the Boltons. This will also leave no chance for the Ironborn to take it. At the point that all this has been established, the Lannisters are so warn out that they can't focus on the North.

* Arya: I don't think much can happen for Arya, and by that I don't mean she's not gonna fuck shit up, she WILL fuck shit up. What I mean is she can't take on armies or anything. I believe she will become some sort of hitman/assassin for the Faceless Men, and might even convince them or some of Braavos' army to try to help out. She just wants to avenge Robb and Ned so she will probably just take out high target values that have wronged them like The Freys or Boltons.

* Bran and Rickon: This is probably one of the more likely things to happen, someone who has immense loyalty to the Starks will send someone to try to find them (This already happened, or was attempted). Eventually someone beyond the wall will find them. They will go under the table and tell the most loyal Northen lords who are royal to the Starks that they are still alive and they will rally to take the North in their name.

I think it has to be one these, not all. I also believe that one of these Starks will die. It's inevitable. Also, the Starks have no interest in the Iron Throne, all they want is the North.

*NOTE* I was never good in analyzing, and I've not read all of AFFC and ADWD so if something's wrong, I'm sorry.",14,5,False,self,,,,,

Am I the only one who's a little bit frustrated by this? I don't really care about any of that, at least not enough that I would take it over The Winds of Winter. The last book came at the end of a six year wait, and the one before it was five years.

With him seeming to want to want to do anything besides write his next book, I genuinely wonder if he's ever even going to finish it. He's on schedule to finish at around age 75, and he's clearly in poor health. Is anyone else concerned/annoyed by this?

We know he's doing some messed up experiments and he mentioned at the end that he has a unbeatable champion for the Queen (haha bitch can't use it). There were other hints but I've forgotten them now.
Anyway I was sitting at work earlier and a few thoughts came to my mind and I think that I may have figured something out.
[AFFC speculation about Qybern's Champion](/g ""* We know that a skull was sent to Dorne, supposedly it was The Mountain's but beetles had picked off all the flesh.* We have no idea what had been done with the body * We know that Qybern wanted to experiment with The MountainWe know that there is a champion who can't be beat"")....Do you see where I'm going with this?

But then I remembered a few things: 

- Varys' untrustworthiness is practically a theme in the series. Can we bother to trust his story about his own cutting... especially when he gives it away so freely? 
- Littlefinger bases his world around what people want sexually. He knows Lysa Arryn wants his dick, he knows Robert Baratheon wants his whores, he knows Jaime and Cersei want each other, and he desperately wants Catelyn, etc. But he constantly wonders what Varys wants. 
- Varys' infamous meeting with Magister Illyrio about bringing the Targaryen Dynasty back to the Iron Throne.

So the question is (and I'm halfway through ASoS... so tag spoilers please XD) could Varys be an Unsullied? I'm basing this on Varys' seemingly incessant effort to bring the Targaryens back to the Throne as a matter of obedience since there is no obvious benefit to himself.

The wolf, being the sigil of the Starks, and a time for, usually meaning a winning moment, has to mean the Starks win the GoT. Did GRRM change the title to not make the end obvious? Maybe, IDK, discuss.

Edit: After doing more analyzing the series is called ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" Ice=The North (Starks) and Fire=Dragons(Dany), this is a bit far'fetched but it's there.

Unfortunately I got exposed to Robb's fate and this ""Red Wedding"". All I knew after reading that spoiler was that Robb dies in this 'red wedding'. Nothing too specific but whenever I thought of Robb and this 'Red' Wedding, I thought of it taking place in the 'Red' Keep. So the Red Keep, King's landing, probably going to be Joffrey's wedding. How I expected it to happen was Robb was gonna make it as far as King's Landing, invade Joffrey's wedding with all his badassery, and die in a badass way... but nope... he makes it nowhere near King's Landing and dies to his own people. My expectations got demolished... and with the ASoIaF series, i know I should be expecting my expectations to be demolished... but I guess this was the first big demolition of my expectations.
TL;DR - how I pictured the RW after reading vague spoilers and how they differed from what actually happened.

I was in Camden Town, London, today at Costa Cafe near Mornington Crescent with a friend when Rob Stark (Richard Madden) walked right by us with his headphones on. It was odd because nobody recognized him, until he passed us with our jaws dropped. 


**Question:**
I was looking into the scheduling and filming of the last season and it got me wondering. The production for season three started two month ago; meaning they should still be on location filming. It wouldn't make sense for a certain wedding to happen until season four, right?

Also when Karstark is talking about his murdered son (I think it's S2:EP9) he says ""I would gladly cut out my heart and offer it to The Father if my sons could rise from the grave."" Karstark would not say this, they follow The Old Gods.

Reed meets up with zombie Catelyn somehow, and he tells her that Ned didn't actually cheat on her, and she feels terrible for being such a bitch to Jon. She goes north, only to find him dead.

In /r/asoiafreread, we began rereading the entire series as a group back in April. Many joined us along the way but as we got into the second half of Game of Thrones, catching up became a longer road. 

**I'd like to invite anyone who missed out in April to join us as we start reading Clash of Kings beginning on October 1!**

We're currently on chapter 68 out of 72 and will have a discussion on the entirety of Game of Thrones on Sunday, September 30. Our first discussion of Clash of Kings will be on October 2 with the prologue of Clash.

Each week, we read and discuss three chapters. Discussions are posted on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. On Sundays, we have a weekly summary. The pace is leisurely and allows for easy catch up if you can't read a chapter on the scheduled day. 

Discussions are friendly and encompass the entire series without the need for spoiler tags. (The only thing we cover with tags are Dunk &amp; Egg spoilers.) Lots of the same people have continually posted during the past 22 weeks but don't let that deter you from joining the discussion with your own insight. Everyone is welcome and it's a laid back place.

^obviously well known and common theory
So
There's also the theory that the original Azor Ahai was Brandon the Builder. He defeated the Others during the long night, and built the wall and yada yada yada
He also built Winterfell.
Winterfell.
Winter Fell
The place where WINTER FELL
Where Brandon the builder defeated the Others with lightbringer.
Maybe Lightbringer never left Winterfell.
Winterfell is known to be in a cold climate, but is still warm due to hot springs running underneath it. Hot springs under Winterfell. Lightbringer under Winterfell. 
Hmmmmm.
Azor Ahai is also said to be reborn ""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."" ~Melly 
It is also said you need ""the blood of the king"" to wake 
I think that Lightbringer, or Lightbringer's Lightbringer, are the Dragons. 
I think that the ""Stone Dragons"" are under Winterfell. 
Jon, after being reborn by Melly or Catelyn (another theory I thought up), has given up his vows, which were until death, and marches south and takes Winterfell with Stannis. By now the Others have managed to get through the wall, and have started to wreck shit. Jon Snow, manages to get into the bowels of Winterfell, and finds the Stone Dragons. He SACRIFICES STANNIS(KINGS BLOOD), WAKES THE DRAGONS AND PROCEEDS TO BBQ SOME OTHER BUTT.
Another theory is that Dany is azor ahai reborn. She was, in a sense, reborn when she hatched her dragons out of stone. There was the comet in the sky, smoke from Drogo's pyre and salt from her tears. She also sacrificed her spouse for her dragons, lightbringer. Maybe, after she takes over Westeros, she goes North to deal with the Others. She goes to Winterfell, and gets under the castle and finds the stone dragons. She then sacrifices Stannis, and wakes the dragons, or finds what else is under Winterfell. Like her brother Viserys always said. Either that or she sacrifices Aegon.
Honestly, I can't see Stannis surviving. I think he's gonna die and Gendry, and the BWOB will get Storms End, as I don't know where they are going to go after this ends.
Also I don't think Aegon's gonna make it. Either he is going to die, through some heroic act or a sacrifice, or be actually a Blackfyre or something similar, and have Storm's End go to him, as it did Orys Baratheon. 
Also
Jaqen is Syrio.

There's also the theory that the original Azor Ahai was Brandon the Builder. He defeated the Others during the long night, and built the wall and yada yada yada
He also built Winterfell.
Winterfell.
Winter Fell
The place where WINTER FELL
Where Brandon the builder defeated the Others with lightbringer.
Maybe Lightbringer never left Winterfell.
Winterfell is known to be in a cold climate, but is still warm due to hot springs running underneath it. Hot springs under Winterfell. Lightbringer under Winterfell. 
Hmmmmm.
Azor Ahai is also said to be reborn ""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."" ~Melly 
It is also said you need ""the blood of the king"" to wake 
I think that Lightbringer, or Lightbringer's Lightbringer, are the Dragons. 
I think that the ""Stone Dragons"" are under Winterfell. 
Jon, after being reborn by Melly or Catelyn, {another theory I thought up}, has given up his vows, which were until death, and marches south and takes Winterfell with Stannis. By now the Others have managed to get through the wall, and have started to wreck shit. Jon Snow, manages to get into the bowels of Winterfell, and finds the Stone Dragons. He SACRIFICES STANNIS{KINGS BLOOD}, WAKES THE DRAGONS AND PROCEEDS TO BBQ SOME OTHER BUTT.
Another theory is that Dany is azor ahai reborn. She was, in a sense, reborn when she hatched her dragons out of stone. There was the comet in the sky, smoke from Drogo's pyre and salt from her tears. She also sacrificed her spouse for her dragons, lightbringer. Maybe, after she takes over Westeros, she goes North to deal with the Others. She goes to Winterfell, and gets under the castle and finds the stone dragons. She then sacrifices Stannis, and wakes the dragons, or finds what else is under Winterfell. Like her brother Viserys always said. Either that or she sacrifices Aegon.
Honestly, I can't see Stannis surviving. I think he's gonna die and Gendry, and the BWOB will get Storms End, as I don't know where they are going to go after this ends.
Also I don't think Aegon's gonna make it. Either he is going to die, through some heroic act or a sacrifice, or be actually a Blackfyre or something similar, and have Storm's End go to him, as it did Orys Baratheon. 
Also
Jaqen is Syrio. 
Arya then kills Jaqen because he tries to kill the dragons.
Jaime will kill Cersei and Melisandre will be burned to death because irony.
That is all."")",4,0,False,self,,,,,

We try to forgive accidents and educate new subscribers to use the tags, but a lot of recent posts have had blatant spoilers in threads with plenty of examples of tag use all around them.  Some people just don't seem to care.  So an in attempt to remedy this growing problem and get the safety level back to manageable levels, people who post blatant spoilers without warnings will be banned immediately.

Like all of the other bans for policy misconduct, if the banned person can understand the mistake, read the posting policy, and promise to be more respectful to the rest of the community, we'll lift their ban to give them a second chance.  We still don't give third chances.  

Hopefully, this will effectively get the attention of the current crop of new subscribers, and the problems will stop.

He'd catch a few episodes of Game of Thrones on HBO but was more interested in shows like Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire, etc.

As of today, he's farther along in AFFC than I am and I have to keep him from calling me to 'SQUEEEEEEEE' about stuff so he doesn't spoil anything for me. :P

**Two:** Then there's my boyfriend who would watch it over my shoulder when I first started getting into it a few months or so ago and he'd poke fun. Now? We own the Game of Thrones board game and we have people over to play it every Thursday night, and he won't stop talking about his favorite parts/characters in the show, and is counting down to 3/31/2013. Pretty soon I'll get him into the books (once my dad gives me my copies of ACOK and ASOS back).

**Three:** One of my friends is a bit of a bro. Loves his motorcycle/muscle car, Call of Duty... Nice kid, but pretty sheltered. Homeschooled for a good chunk of his life, he's now a youth leader at his church. Doesn't really swear (unless it's serious business), NEVER drinks, is very nice and polite. Doesn't watch much TV.

Aaaaaaand now he's extremely into GoT. Since the first season went up on Zune we've had him over a couple of nights this last week to get him through it (he's coming over tonight to watch [S01E06](/s ""Viserys die a horrible awesome death"")). 

I just thought I'd share. I love introducing my friends and family to awesome shit that they wouldn't normally watch/read, and I'm so excited to have more people in my life that I can share this with.

So I'm a little confused about Jaime's character right now. He seems to be actually a pretty likable guy, yes he loves his sister, but you can't control who you fall in love with, slaying the king was a good deed after all, and the way he treats Brienne is pretty knighty, I would say.

He frees Tyrion in the end and seems to be genuinly sorry about the whole Tysha business.

Everything he did that made him look like a total D-bag in the first two books is explained and justified in ASOS. EXCEPT: He threw Bran out of the window. It is said that he regrets that, but more for logical reasons than feeling sorry. This deed isn't in any way justified. I just don't get the Character atm, he seems such a chill guy except he throws little children out of windows. Doesn't really fit, does it?

A lot of people say he is neither good nor bad, he just doesn't care, often doesn't think, and really only ever cares about his family. While that would explain the way he treated Ned in AGOT and to an extent why he threw Bran out of the window, it wouldn't explain him killing the mad King and especially not how he treated Brienne. Also, how he acted towards the end of ASOS with the whole inheriting Casterly vs being boss of the kingsguard - business.",21,9,False,self,,,,,

It was shortly after the release of ADWD, that i even found out about Game of Thrones. I was at wal-mart, and happened to walk past their ""book"" section, and the cover caught my eye. I picked it up and turned the cover over and saw that it was a series of books. Intrigued, i make a mental note to look them up when i get home but before i even finished that thought i turned around to see Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows all right there on the shelf. I thought this must just be destiny so without any hesitation i bought all 5 books right there on the spot. (BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE)

Immediately the way he told the story had me hooked. It's like you are living the character's life every time you read their chapter. You pick up on details they do, react almost the same as they do, and even start to feel like you are with them watching this happen. All the houses seem like real families that you might have even met in person, and the realm is in such a state that it makes me think that there can almost be no good or evil anymore. I couldn't get enough and I finished the first book in almost one sitting, and just like any good book series, it ended in such chaos that you as a reader have no choice but to pick up the next one to find out what is going to happen to all of the characters you have become so attached too. 

In the Song of Ice and Fire series though, George RR Martin does you dirty. 

Just when you are starting to fully appreciate a character and all of the decisions they have made and why they are doing it..... he kills them. Boom. Just like that. I found myself switching favorite characters multiple times just because they person i found my favorite at the time almost always ended up dying. I hate it, but i love it too. He forces you to pay attention to EVERY character and EVERY detail in the stories. There were things I just noticed for the first time on my last read through in book 1 that come up again in book 5 and it took almost 3 read throughs of the whole series before I even realized it. THAT is what good writing should be like. You should be able to read a book once and be able to remember every detail, you have to pay attention and almost take notes on it just to remember which house serves which lord. 

I'm now going to share some of my favorite parts of the Series, in order, to further explain why ASOIAF has raised the bar for fantasy writing for the future.

Book 1: A Game of Thrones
The series starts out mainly focusing on the Starks, which is awesome because they are probably the most badass house in all of the realm. Granted, other houses had their moments, but the Starks have held their own the whole time. Eddard Stark was my first favorite character. He was firm, but he had honor. When he went down to king's landing i couldn't help but think ""oh everything will be fine by the end of the book, this guy knows what he is doing even if king Robert doesn't."" How wrong I was. Sure Eddard did a damn good job while he was down there, but he should have known starting to ask questions would lead to trouble. I don't think anyone really saw his death coming, in the show, or the book. I read the chapter over like 3 times to make sure there wasn't anything I missing. Sure enough, he died. George Martin - 1 , Me - 0 . The other thing to note about book 1 is how AWESOME Tyrion Lannister is. He is the only character you can afford to love because he hasn't been killed off in the series (.....yet). You start to see his cunningness and his charm right away in the books and Peter Dinklage does an INCREDIBLE job portraying it on the tv show rendition. 

Book 2: A Clash of Kings
In book 2 George Martin doesn't really kill off THAT many people, but he spends a lot of time introducing new characters and adding detail to the story. That's really all of his books in one word though, Detail. Tyrion is still a badass, Robb is King of the North, and Catelyn is still messing up all of Robb's work by being a concerned parent.

Book 3 : A Storm of Swords
SHIT REALLY HITS THE FAN. EVERYONE DIES AND IT'S AWFUL. I COULDN'T STOP READING. You start to see the good side of Jaime Lannister, which i enjoyed because i was starting to hate the guy, but he showed a good side in this book which made me like him a lot. Losing a hand really changes your perception on what is important in your life.

Book 4: A Feast for Crows
This was the hardest to read for me of the 5 out so far just because none of the characters i really wanted to read about were in it. I understand why he does this ( for those who don't this is a HUGE fantasy series, there is so much detail and it is such a HUGE world that you really couldn't do it justice by trying to cram it all into one book, so he split books 4-5 into sides of the world. book 4 is the 7 kingdoms and book 5 is the eastern territory aka the free cities.) but i wish he could have thrown in a Tyrion, or Jon Snow chapter here and there to make the read go by a little quicker. AFFC was still fantastic and it is really crucial to the whole story so don't take this as a ""nah we don't need to read that one"" &lt;- WRONG. you need to read them all, and read them well.

Book 5: A Dance with Dragons
:).. that's all i really need to say about this book. It is my favorite so far in the series, the longest i believe also or at least second to A Storm of Swords, but by far the best story telling in it. You get to catch up with all your favorite characters at this point, and even meet a few new ones who you know are going to be CRUCIAL to the rest of the story. It always made me happy when reading this book to meet a new character to find out what exactly their role would be. No character in this whole book series is pointless. Except perhaps moonboy.


To make a long story longer, Read A Song of Ice and Fire book series if you haven't already. If you love good stories filled with action, adventure, romance, deception, humor, and drama, you will love every single page of this story. It's a story that you can go back to again and again, rereading your favorite parts, laughing over the same lines and enjoying every second. I know I have.
 
Side note: if you have read this book series (ASOIAF) another good one to check out would be ""The KingKiller Chronicles"" by Patrick Rothfuss, book one is called The Name of the Wind, and the second is A Wise Man's Fear, the third is due out soon i hope.

The Three-Eyed Crow explains this by saying that the Weirwoods are timeless (will live forever) and the passing of centuries are like the passing of minutes for the sacred trees.

When Bran first slips inside the tree, he sees Eddard as a young man praying for forgiveness for bringing home Jon Snow. After that vision fades away, he sees a picture of Lyana fighting with either Ned or Brandon by the pond. Then he has a series of other visions, quickly since he only spends a few seconds in that specific memory. 

The visions are of ""a woman heavy with child emerging naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenger her. 

""Then there came a brown haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor. A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows.

""And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them.

""Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped toward them through a drift of dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand....the woman grabbed the captive by the hair, hooked the sickle round his throat, and slashed.""

My question is, are we supposed to know what the other visions are yet? Or is it yet another example of GRRM's amazing foreshadowing? I haven't the foggiest what the pregnant woman is supposed to be, nor the tall knight. The Kings of Winter standing around the tree might be significant, but for what I couldn't say. And the execution in the end is most likely the First Men due to their use of bronze.

Any help /r/gameofthrones?

Edit: Like I said, I'm only 50% of the way through ADWD, so even though the thread is tagged ADWD, please use spoilers for anything past the part I have said.",24,12,False,self,,,,,

A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. Theyve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know. 

Then they get a taste of battle. 

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after theyve been gutted by an axe. 

They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when thats still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. 

If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands theyre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there its just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They dont know where they are or how to get back home and the lord theyre fighting for does not know their names, yet 
here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world... 

And the man breaks. 

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them... but he should pity them as well.",8,19,False,self,,,,,

This bugged me a long time, considering that the last dragons obviously had been killed and that Dany didn't actually actively [Season 1](/s ""kill her brother""). It wasn't until I read the book that I had my Oh-moment and facepalmed myself into oblivion.

I plowed through books one and two and now that winter is coming, I've started on book three, A Storm of Swords. 

I loved how GRRM made us love Ned Stark, but then killed him off at the end of AGOT, I loved how he made us think Bran and Rickon were gone, but they weren't really and everything turned out to be okay. 

However, I feel he has gone too far now. I'm around page 700, Robb and Catelyn are dead and Ygritte just died in Jon's arms... I was getting annoyed with the Arya story line, how you always thought ""yes, she's going to be reunited with her family"" and somehow, something always messed it up for her. When she arrived at the Twins with Clegane, I really really wished we'd be done with it, but no. Now Robb is gone (I couldn't really care less about Catelyn, the character annoyed me), Jon suffered his loss...

I don't mind a main character dying, some bad luck on the road... Life isn't fair and people die. However, in my opinion (really, this is purely personal), I really feel a good book needs some characters you love and can trust on. However, all the characters I seem to love, die or are met with horrible misfortune. And this is spoiling it for me. I am now afraid to love characters, to submerge myself in the books and be swept away by them, out of fear something bad will happen to them and I'll be heartbroken again. 

So please, someone, tell me (without spoiling anything) if it's worth reading on? Some discussion ofcourse would be welcome as well. I know I'll probably keep reading, because I really want to know what happens to Westeros, but I'm afraid I'll be met with a feeling of disappointment at the end.

 After Drogo died in season 1 I think all the cast and crew heard at various conventions was ""Bring back Drogo!"" so that's what they did. It really made me mad that we missed out on the really cool prophecies in the house of the undying for pandering to fans to bring back a very minor character in the whole scheme of the story. It also undermines a theme in the books where Dany remembers him fondly and wonders what might have been.

I commute everyday to work via an hour-long train ride.  For the most part this is a pleasant ride and I generally enjoy having that time to myself, but every once in awhile I encounter some real assholes.  
  
After a particularly long and draining day of work on a Sunday, I finally got to my train and took my seat.  Everything was going very normal: people filing onto the train and taking seats, people having small conversations or eating some food or enjoying an after-work beer or cocktail.  I took out my ASOIAF book (was on ASOS at the time) and cracked open a cold beer. Then I see them: two big guys wearing Yankee caps and jerseys, obviously drunk from the way they are stumbling and yelling.  I watch them walking down the aisle, and much to my displeasure, they choose to sit directly across the aisle from me.  I ignore them and start reading and sipping my beer.  The guy closest to me looks over, sees that I'm drinking a beer and reading ASOIAF, he gives me a look that says ""I enjoy both of those things, but I am also a drunken idiot.""  He then proceeds to pull out a full-size bottle of Jack Daniels, crack it open, chug a few shots, then pass it to his friend.  I can tell that things are about to get loud, and they do.  The train leaves the station and their awful conversation begins.  They start out talking LOUDLY about the one guy's ex gf, and how he misses ""railing out that pussy"" and ""blowing a load on those lips"".  I am already pissed off now, as there are women and families around, who are all looking very uncomfortable at this point.  I'm also trying my very best to clarify visually that I am NOT drinking with these guys, just enjoying one after-work drink.  
  
Then a female conductor enters our car and starts taking tickets.  The big guys see her and one of them starts making inappropriate remarks about her butt and boobs, again very loudly.  He then tells his buddy "" I'm gonna totally flirt with her, watch"".  This should be entertaining...  He waits for her to take his ticket before drunkenly spouting off ""YOU ARE THE HOTTEST TRAIN CONDUCTOR IVE EVER SEEN"" and then before she could even walk away, he turns to his buddy and says ""SEE I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA FLIRT WITH HER, AND I DID""  lady conductor is not impressed.  Next, they start burping at each other after chugging more whiskey, gross.  Then the one closest to me takes his shoes off, and his feet STINK.  I'm getting really annoyed at this point, and so are the rest of the people in the car.  I'm thinking about all of the shit I'd like to say to these guys about how inconsiderate they are being of everyone around them, and I'm about to, when one of them says something that gives me a great (evil) idea...  The one closest to me turns to his friend and says ""OH MAN ITS SUNDAY, I CAN't WAIT TO GO HOME AND WATCH GAME OF THRONES, DUDE THERES SO MANY TITS ITS A GREAT SHOW"" to which his friend replies "" YA BRO I LOVE THAT SHOW ITS SO GOOD HURR DURR""  
  
I know what I must do.  
  
I sit, quietly enduring more burps and foot smells and awful comments about 'PUSSY BRO' and 'RAILING HER OUT BRO' until the train arrives at my stop.  I wait a moment to make sure these guys aren't getting off at the same stop, cause they gonna be MADDDD in a second.  They are still sitting, OPERATION GoT IS A GO.  I get up, put my hand on the guy closest to me's shoulder, and VERY quietly, so no other passengers can hear me, I say:  
  
""Well guys, thanks so much for all the wonderful sights, sounds, and smells..... [ASOS](/b ""ROBB AND CATELYN DIE"")  
  
It took them a second to process what I had just said, and as I walked towards to exit, they just started screaming 'FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER WHY WOULD YOU FUCKING DO THAT YOU FUCKING FAGGOT""  
  
Unexpected bonus:  Everyone on the train has had enough at this point and starts yelling at them to watch their mouths, "" MY KIDS RIGHT HERE"" etc. Which makes me lol even harder.  
  
I get off the train, and stand on the platform, looking in at them raging.  I wave goodbye through the window, and go on my way.
  
On my walk home I think about how long it's going to be before the series even gets to that point, and lol more.  Long troll FTW.

**tl;dr: I used my knowledge of ASOS spoilers to completely ruin the HBO series for two disrespectful, drunken assholes on the train**

So how did Jon Snow come about?  And if Ned's not his father, why is Ned caring for Jon and pretending?  How does his possible parentage affect the story?  If Robb named him heir to Winterfelll would he take it?  What of the Iron Throne?

Basically we as a community are pretty interested in who might fulfill the prophecy of Azor Ahai reborn, and most signs point to Jon Snow. Or Daenerys. But if there was some portion of the prophecy that referred to 'his song being the song of ice and fire,' and that actually corresponds to being of Stark and Targaryen parentage (dream/flashback!Rhaegar would have been incorrect in referring to his first son Aegon VI in this way, perhaps he didn't realize till later, and tried to snag a third dragon(which at the time would have been, in his opinion, Rhaenys, Aegon VI and future child) and complete the prophecy in one go by bedding Lyanna), then Jon has one up on her. 

So anyway, there's this big hullabloo about who is Azor Ahai reborn. It's really cool and exciting to line up the prophecy, but what do we really know about it? Azor Ahai was supposedly some great hero 8,000 years ago, the last time The Other's forces came knocking. While it doesn't seem like the Others were really up to any good, the only thing we know about them is they went south 8,000 years ago and attacked things. 

All we have ever heard about their controlling entity is via red priests. That is, their enemy. We don't really know their motivation, we just know R'hllor rhetoric on the subject. Blah blah terrible god of cold and darkness, evil, yadda yadda. 

It could be that the War for the Dawn 8,000 years ago was merely the god of cold reacting in a force of nature sort of way to an incursion on his continent...and it merely took him 4,000 years to get moving. It's cold way up north, things go slowly and a hugely long winter was needed to galvanize his stuff. 

Why do I even think anything along these lines? Mainly because I don't trust the red priests, and everything Melisandre says about R'hllor just smacks of something spoken by someone who doesn't know the whole picture. If Rhllor and the other are locked in enternal cosmic combat, why should one -actually- be evil? Wouldn't they just be opposing aspects of the nature of the universe? 

Coldhands certainly doesn't seem to be evil. At the very least, he seems self-aware and autonomous. Perhaps 

One last note on the subject--Bran's conversation with the three-eyed crow. Brynden notes to him,
 *'The strongest trees are rooted in the dark places of the earth. Darkness will be your cloak, your shield, your mother's milk. Darkness will make you strong.* 
This passage sticks out like a sore thumb, because it's pro-darkness. Haven't seen one of those very often. Brynden, hundreds of years old and tapped into the nature of the planet and all, might be keen on the actual nature of the fire/ice duality of the planet, and doesn't see darkness/cold/The Other as an evil entity.

Or, he totally is, and The Other totally is evil, and is attempting to ensnare Bran for his super evil ice-zombie army. There's always that.

But anyway, ASOIAF has always had a theme of tearing down your preconceived fantasy notions, and has never, ever, not EVER been about black and white morality, so it seems highly unlikely that the basic facts of the cosmos revolve around one, so...

The red priests and the white walkers vastly misunderstand the actual nature of the(se) two gods. They see them as diametrically opposed, and do war with each other, the White Walkers going about it super slowly, waiting for long-ass winters and raising things from the dead, and the red priests attack the opposition with a fiery zeal. We know next to nothing about the society of the white walkers, if they even have one, so that's conjecture. But I'm betting that, whoever they are, they are aware of a greater cold entity, and perhaps draw power from it like the red priests do with R'hllor, but don't understands its aims. If it even has any--I'm suggesting that it doesn't, **that it's basically a force of nature, a governor of darkness and death and ice and other natural things--same as R'hllor for light, birth, heat, etc.**

Red priests try to convert everyone. So do White Walkers...although they do it via killing you, but then, that makes sense when you serve the god of death.
