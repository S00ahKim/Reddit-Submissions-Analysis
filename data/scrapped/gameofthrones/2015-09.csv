2,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-9-1,2015,9,1,9,3j5j2q,self.gameofthrones,[All spoilers][Theory] What if it's all a red herring?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3j5j2q/all_spoilerstheory_what_if_its_all_a_red_herring/,death_to_all_humans,1441066116,"So at this point there seems to have emerged a consensus about who Jon's parents are even though it hasn't been explicitly confirmed.  And because of what it implies about Jon's importance to the story, it's widely believed that he's not permanently dead.  In fact, those two theories, R+L=J and Jon's impending resurrection, are pretty much gospel to much of the fanbase.  


But what if it's not?  Maybe there's another option, and all that is just a red herring.  After all, it wouldn't be much of a surprise to see Jon resurrected and informed that his parents are Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryan, everyone is expecting that now.  It would *satisfy* fans, but since when has the series ever been about giving the audience what they want?  More often, it's subverted expectations.  So maybe all this hoopla about where Kit Harrington is and what his hair looks like is nothing more than a distraction so that when the actual reveal comes, everyone gets their socks knocked off.  If for no other reason than to keep some sort of suspense going, I've been thinking about other options.


I read a post on here a couple days ago that informed me that Thoros of Myr resurrected Beric Donarrian just by saying a typical prayer, and he somehow just came back to life.  Red priests have said that prayer tons of times for tons of dead people and as far as we know none have come back to life so far.  It's something about the Thoros/Beric situation that makes him come back to life, not just a red priest being magic.  We're all expecting Melisandre to bring Jon back since she showed up at the wall just a little bit before he got stabbed, but it might not be that simple.  Resurrection exists in the universe of the series, but it's not exactly common.  Jon could easily get turned into a wight (hence Kit Harrington's appearance and location), but other methods of resurrection are pretty difficult and unlikely.  


There was that theory going around that Meera Reed is actually Jon's twin sister, which was interesting but had the obvious logical hole of how Howland Reed managed to convince everyone that his not pregnant wife suddenly popped a baby out.  But what if Ned Stark and Howland Reed found a dying Lyanna with a baby girl?  They try to figure out how to honor Lyanna's dying wish to keep the child safe.  Ned *could* take the baby back to Winterfell with him, but his buddy King Robert will probably be coming by there, or at least sending some of his people, both because they fought together and because Ned is warden of the north, and do you really want a secret Targaryan who is the rightful heir to the throne hiding right under the nose of the man who wants to kill all surviving Targaryans to cement his rule?  But Howland Reed has a suggestion.  His wife was pregnant when they left and if she hasn't given birth yet she will very soon.  They will secretly swap the babies, Howland raising Lyanna's daughter as his own, and Ned taking baby Jon Reed back with him and claiming him to be a bastard.  Sure it's a lot to ask of Howland Reed, but he loves the Starks, and Lyanna probably stood up for him that one time.  He'd be honored to raise her child, and he'd trust Ned to raise his.  And that way the secret heir to the iron throne could live in some tiny out of the way place that nobody cared about. 


I mean it's kind of out there, but there's a little evidence.  Lyanna was supposed to have been a warrior type and a lot like Arya, exactly the way Meera Reed is.  The rose that symbolizes Lyanna growing from the ice is said to represent Jon at the wall, but Meera is north of it too.  


Mostly though I think it would be a surprising twist but also be good for the story as a whole.  In the conventionally expected scenario, Jon needs to be resurrected somehow, and then someone needs to find out the truth about his parents and, crucially, communicate it to him.  Bran could probably find out with his tree magic stuff, but how would he let Jon know?  Meanwhile, Meera is chilling in the tree with him.  If R+L=M, Bran can see it and then get his ass back to the main events as he and Meera travel back south.  Otherwise, it seems like he might be stuck in a tree forever.  


""Kill the boy, and let the man emerge.""  Most people take that as foreshadowing, I think it might be a red herring.  The characters in the series have never had the typical movie-esque turning points where some event causes a huge change in their personality.  One of the things that makes it good is the slow, realistic character development.  Nobody ceases to become one person and becomes someone else, each event changes them slightly.  Arya is trying to become no one, but she's still Arya because you can't wipe the slate like that and start over.  It would be completely out of character for the show to have Jon Snow become Jon Targaryan with a new personality and shit.  Or even for such obvious foreshadowing to actually happen, it's too literal.  Maybe some different ""man"" will emerge from somewhere now that Jon is dead.  Maybe Jon becomes a wight and kills Olly.  But for a series that has been so much about subverting common tropes, it seems a little too neat and pretty to bring Jon back, reveal him as Jon Targaryan, and set him off to try and take his rightful place on the iron throne.

I thought the scene with the night's king ""converting"" the last of Craster's baby sons meant  they were turning the baby into a white walker. But how is that possible if the white walkers are a totally different species? If they'e just making him a wight, what's the big deal? They have hundreds of wights already. Why did they need a living baby?
 

What do you think Arya's endgame in this whole thing is? She's training to be a deadly killer, but to kill who? Most of the major people on her list are already dead, and if Maggy's prophecy is to be believed, Arya wont get to kill Cersei either. Will she meet up with Dany before she sails to Westeros? What kind of impact will she have on the war for the dawn? It would seem like a totally pointless story arc unless she ended up killing a major character in the end.


Has GRRM ever mentioned an inspiration for Duncan the tall? He's described as being nearly seven feet tall, and he first appears in a book published in 2005. Is there any way this character is named after Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs? He's 6' 11"" and the Spurs won the championship in both 2003 and 2005. (long shot I know)


Is there any legitimacy to the badass ice dragon theories? I can see it going two different ways. Either there is a long dead dragon buried up north (possibly in the wall), and the night's kind is going to raise it as a wight. Or theres somehow an ice dragon hidden beneath Winterfell (the icy pool in the Godswood?), and someone is going to either waken it or summon it through magical means. So far theres only precedent on the show for the first scenario. What are your opinions? 


Is Qyburn up to something? Does he have his own motives or a desire for power? He's so slippery you almost forget about him and he's impossible to read. 

and finally

It's said that the long night lasted a generation, and that another long night is coming. First of all, how do people know this? What signs are there that the coming winter will be an especially long one? And if there really is another long night coming, we have to think about the idea that maybe none of our main characters is going to be the one to save humanity. Maybe that person hasn't even been born yet, or is still just an infant. One possibility could be Gilly's baby. There would be a certain irony in it- Craster was sacrificing his sons to the Others, what if his last son was the one to destroy them? That baby has certainly been getting a lot of screen time. Another possibility is that two characters we know could come together to conceive the actual prince that was promised. Maybe the bittersweet ending GRRM talks about is that all the characters we know die off, and we are left with only a distant glimmer of hope for mankind in the form of a child. 

I'll post more when I think of them.

But the more I think about it, the more I think they're a little neglected on this subreddit. Several things occur to me:  

1) GRRM has stated that an image of the Direwolves was the starting point for the entire series.  
&gt;. . . suddenly it just came to me, this scene, from what would ultimately be the first chapter of A Game of Thrones. It's from Bran's viewpoint; they see a man beheaded and they find some direwolf pups in the snow. It just came to me so strongly and vividly that I knew I had to write it. I sat down to write, and in, like, three days it just came right out of me, almost in the form you've read.  

2) There is absolutely no way the appearance of the 6  Direwolves was a random event. They were sent by someone to guide and protect the Stark children.  

3) The CofTF have the ability to warg into Direwolves, and the power to control them. Back in the day they used them in battle. So did they send the Direwolves to the Starks? Did Bloodraven?  

4) Starks can also warg into Direwolves, and have a historically close relationship with them. Think direwolf sigil. My tinfoil theory from earlier today wondered whether the Direwolves contain the souls of dead, warged Starks (out there, I know). Think of  Nymeria containing the warged soul of Robb Stark, leading his army of wolves through the Riverlands. Maybe this is where all Starks go when they die (Jon into Ghost anyone?)...who knows?  

Many possibilities. But I am as sure as I can be that the Direwolves are crucial to the unfolding story. So just wondering if anyone else has given this some thought.  

- who sent them?  

- who controls them?  

- what roll will they play in the unfolding story?",28,16,False,self,,,,,

We know that Theon and Sansa's most likely destination is the Wall. How does this rough outline of the story look to you?

1. Theon and Sansa arrive at the Wall and meet Davos shortly afterward, Sansa trusts him and sends him to the Umbers to look for her brothers (we know Smalljon was cast).

2. Davos essentially has all the Wyman Manderly stuff with Smalljon Umber instead, he's told Rickon and Osha were sent to Skagos because the North wasn't safe for them with the Boltons in charge.

3. Davos sails to Skagos to look for Rickon and Osha. 

4. Littlefinger attacks Winterfell and overthrows the Boltons. 

5. Sansa, Theon and Melisandre escape Castle Black with Jon's body to take it back to Winterfell. 

6. Theon is sacrificed (almost out of mercy) by Melisandre in Winterfell and Jon Snow rises once again. 

We know that in TWOW, it seems like Stannis is going to sacrifice Theon to help him in the Battle for Winterfell (King's blood and all that) and we know that Shireen is going to be sacrificed by Melisandre at some point and it would make sense that it would be to save Jon. 

So basically, what the show elected to do was to switch the sacrifices around to add a little intensity. Stannis sacrificed Shireen to help him in the Battle of Winterfell which didn't really work, and now Theon will be sacrificed by Melisandre to save Jon. 

How does that sound? Obviously it's just a rough outline of what I think will happen and many more events will take place, but what do you think? Feasible? ",44,32,False,self,,,,,

Thanks to everyone for the book and GRRM interview info you've provided.  

I remain absolutely convinced that the Direwolves are at the centre of the story. That someone has sent the Direwolves specifically to the Stark children. All of them have Direwolves and all of them are wargs ""to a greater or lesser extent"". But this is not a ""Stark thing"". GRRM has made it quite clear that Ned, and prior generations of Starks were NOT wargs. That it is *extremely* unusual that the Stark children can warg. So I believe that it is the arrival of the Direwolves that has brought the warging ability, not the other way around.  

So here's where I'm going with this. Is it possible that it is the Direwolves that control the Stark children, and not the other way around? That the wolves reach out to the Stark children and initiate the warg, rather than the other way around, as we see with experienced wargs like Varamyr? Are they warged, not wargs?",17,13,False,self,,,,,

[3] (#g ""Jon becomes a White Walker"")
      - we've seen babies seemingly turned into white walkers - we don't know if adults can
      - it requires the Night King to do this and we don't know where he is - he may actually have to touch the person - he probably isn't at Castle Black and maybe can't even currently pass through the wall. 
     - Jon as a necromancer is a pretty big shift in the show - maybe bigger than him dying  
[4] (#g ""Jon is truly, irreversably dead"")
      - Jon has has more screen time than just about any other character in season 5 and has been in the show since the beginning - he is one of the most three most prominent characters (Daenerys, Tyrion being the other two).   There is a good chance [theory](#g ""R+L = J"") is true and this would be killed before being realized..

So my question is;  Although rarely, when a maester completes his studies magic or whatever, he earns a Valyrian steel chain link which he must forge, as he is the one that forges all of his chain links.  So does that mean that the 1/100 maesters that are learned in the ""higher studies"" have learned how to forge/reforge valyrian steel? And/or does that also mean that the Citadel has a stash of valyrian steel meant for the reforging of the chain link?

After Sansa's experiences, not only in the books, but also on the show, is it not possible that Sansa will come to realize that Tyrion wasn't such a monster after all, that the Lannisters still have their uses and that she might well come to, if not love, then respect, embrace and bed Tyrion?

It'd be hard to spend an entire season within a week or two before Jon's body began decomposing enough to make him useless after resurrection. 

This is my only issue with him coming back in season 7. I just don't understand how they would avoid a funeral for Jon, burying him somewhere instead and also spending an entire season doing nothing so that Jon's body doesn't decompose by season 7.

Also Kit Harrington has been spotted a lot in Belfast where they are filming Season 6 but it's still pretty possible for them to either be trolling or just filming a burial scene while he's on vacation.",21,1,False,self,,,,,

The man in The House of Black and White is not Jaqen or the man Arya saved from the fire. The face she saw was a mask. I remember how excited some people I knew were and how some claimed that they knew it when they read the books. I couldnt explain to them the mask theory because I didnt have a comeback for So how did he know what mask to use? question. The man that was Jaqen, the man Arya saved can no longer use the Jaqen identity because Jaqen is dead. Arya killed that face when she named him.  The man she met was an assassin, perhaps even younger than the man in The House of Black and White. If he truly was the man she knew, who tended to the house when he was off roaming around in Westeros?

He couldn't tell he who he was. However, he wanted to give her the chance to understand who he is. 


Does this make any sense to anyone? 

When you become no one, your face becomes public domain. 

The name of the mask is Jaqen.

Which basically says that the Hound and the Mountain will fight to the death, most likely in a trial by combat over Cersei's current crimes. However there is also a lot of evidence pointing towards Cersei burning kings landing to the ground. Which might conflict with her being in captivity for a trial by combat. Merging these two theories together is what made me believe that the future of kings landing is such...

Cersei burns kings landing to the ground, and a makeshift Clegane bowl occurs in the palace... while its on fire.

Clegane bowl occurring in a firey castle plays very well on the Hounds fear of fire as it surrounds him, as the Mountain begins to take Cersei away the hound could show up and begin the -get hype- brawl. I personally believe it will kill Cersei and Tommen (if he doesn't die earlier) leaving only the survivor of Clegane bowl to escape (I said it would be the Hound with the help of Arya but thats a little too much hopefulness).

This leaves Westeros with no royalty, no capital, and no money, just as the white walkers make there march.

I came here to see if anyone else had suggested it yet, and I don't see it, so here goes. Apologies if I overlooked the discussion!

I know they've aged up characters on the show, but Book-Dickon is only ten or so.  A preteen.  That guy is clearly MUCH older than that. 

Anyone else think there's a slight chance he's actually been cast as Aegon VI Targaryen and the ""Dickon Tarly"" thing is just a cover story? He's a good age for (f)Aegon and he sure looks the part.  I would have said that the showrunners had advanced the plot past the point where (f)Aegon could be introduced, but if they're going back to AFFC to pick up the Kingsmoot plot thread, I'm no longer so sure they won't go back and do the same with the (f)Aegon story point.   Yes, I know they already took the ""Tyrion takes a boat down the river"" and ""devoted retainer gets grayscale"" plots and handed them to other characters, but so what? It wouldn't be the first time they've played Scramble Mix-And-Match with plots and characters. 

So what do you folks think? Possible? Or not?

They don't really talk much about it, but it seems strange timing. The Starks have just won a war, and Ned in now the Lord of the North, but he is recently married and only has one heir when Benjen takes the black. Had some tragedy befallen Ned and (at the time) only son, the Stark line would be finished. A sickness could easily take both of them. Benjen would have been much more useful to his family had he stayed in Winterfell, but he hurried off to the wall soon after Ned's return. Why?

My theory is that this is because he had something to do with Lyanna's disappearance. He may have helped her escape with her lover, or she may have confided her plan to him and sworn him to secrecy, or otherwise facilitated the whole affair. Then it would make sense for Ned to be totally fine with his brother taking the black: it keeps him at the wall, serving the realm, but far away from Robert or anyone who might ask questions about what he did and what he knew. He might have even known the truth of Jon's parentage. It would explain why he was so encouraging to Jon about joining the Watch, because he knew it would keep his nephew safe. If the truth of his parentage ever came out he still wouldn't be seen as a threat to the throne because of his vows.

I thought I'd share how I would bring back our beloved hero.

First I'll explain my theory. I think that the Starks in general have some awesome spiritual dire wolf shit going on. The same way the Targaryen's have their dragon stuff. I think that the cinematography used in Bran's wake up scene back in season 1 was not just for dramatic affect. When the camera switches between Ned killing Sansa's wolf Lady, and Bran in his bed, I believe it's to tell us that Starks share life force with dire wolves. Now I know that Lady was not Bran's wolf, but I don't think any magic this story has depicted has been very specific.

Now with that said, Here is how I would write Jon's comeback.

Season 6 episode 1 would show the Night's watch. Ser Allister as first ranger is acting in charge, and kicking it in castle black with his supporters discussing big new plans for the night's watch. Meanwhile, Sam (Being informed of Jon's death), has returned to castle black for Jon's funeral service. He and the other loyal to Jon brothers are north of the wall under the god's wood tree getting ready to burn Jon.

Back at the castle Ser Allister riles up the men by announcing that they will all be going to kill Ghost to finally be rid of the bastard once and for all. The cinematography will begin to mirror Bran's awakening here as the camera switches between the brothers about to burn Jon, and the brothers about to kill Ghost. Sam finishes his prayers and lights the pyre, just as Ser Allister and the brothers kill Ghost. Jon wakes up burning on the pyre, freaks out, and falls into the snow where he is tended to by his brothers. It is here that we discover Jon is NOT BURNED. REVEALING ALL ALONG THAT HE IS IN FACT HALF TARGARYEN!! And that his parents are in fact Lyanna Stark and Reigar Targaryen.

Jon takes this opportunity to leave the Night's Watch, seeing as his watch ended with his death. Jon then proceeds to venture forth to what awaits him (meeting Bran beyond the wall? Finding Sansa and Theon?) Food for thought.

I'm talking about Jon.

If we take the 'Re(d)surrection' theory, how does everyone feel Jon will react?

Personally, I have the theory that when the Red God resurrects you, you latch on to the last emotion/intention/memory you have and it fills your being. 

For example

Berric's first death was at a battle. His last intention before death was to fight. Since being brought back, he has travelled round fighting people. This is his only purpose.

Cat's last intention was revenge. Since then she has been hanging Freys like it's going out of business.

Everyone says Jon will leave the wall and rebuild the Stark family/retake Winterfell, but I think he's going to stay exactly where he is. His last thought was likely either 'Revenge' or 'Stop the Others'. His new persona will be influenced by those feelings.

(As a sidenote, I would just fucking love him to come back to life and act like nothings happened just to fuck with the mutineers. I doubt this will happen though.)",50,15,False,self,,,,,

Would it be possible that Daenerys Targaryen ends up being the main villian of the story? I know that in the beginning she was protrayed as a helpless little underdog that we can't help but root for but i suspect that that could be a trick by our dear GRRM to fuck with our brains as he is so prone to doing.

She is now in a very favourable postition to make a run for the throne (despite everything in season 5) and lets not forget has motherfucking dragons. But.....she has shown many signs of being almost as cruel as her brother and father (all her esacapedes in meeren and her letting Viserys die etc etc) and who knows, maybe her sadistic streak is just starting to develop. Before she was advised by the no doubt very noble duo of Selmy and Mormont who kept her largely in line but it also showed that she is quite an incompetent leader and seems to not be able to make a single intelligent decision by herself. Now, with them gone and Tyrion at her side (who, no matter how much we love him, is a cunning little bastard who will almost certainly use her for his own benefit), who knows what on earth she might do next?

This seris lacks a obvious villian now with many major players dead, jailed or worse (not counting the White Walkers), so its high time for her to step up eh? What do yall think? She could be the next ""Mad Queen"" in my opinon.

Over the past few weeks Ive been formulating a bunch of theories and predictions regarding season 6 and I finally worked up the courage to write them down and post them. 

Tyrion

In season 6 Tyrion will take over much of Barristans story line from the later parts of ADWD, as well as his own storyline from the book. Tyrion will smash what's left of the harpies, bring the second sons back into the fold (after they defect) and defend Mereen against the forces of Slaver's Bay/Ghiscar/Qarth. His season will end with the battle for Mereen (episode 9 mabey?) and the return of Dany with her Dragons and the Dothraki (more on this later)

Jaime

Im not entirely sure what Jaime will be doing this season (Riverlands?), but I think that he will save Kings landing from Cerei (who, after losing her trial by combat will try to burn the city down), becoming the Queenslayer.

Dany

Dany, with significant difficulty, will rally the Dothraki to her side. A Khal must be able to ride, and one who can ride a Dragon is pretty impressive. Ultimately she will relieve Mereen at the last moment, possibly burning the rest of Slavers Bay/Qarth/Ghiscar to the ground. She might go a little crazy (Targaryen crazy gene)

Jorah

Jorah will most likely redeem himself in the eyes of Dany and possibly (probably) sacrifice himself in the process, since Greyscale has put a timer on his head. 

Cersei

Cersei will probably be pretty drunk/crazy by this point, especially considering the beating she took during the walk of shame. She will now very paranoid and start stockpiling Wildfire as well as burning down the tower of the hand. She will lose her trial by combat when the Hound shows up, flee back to the red keep, poison Tommen, and order the pyromancer to burn the city. Jaime will race her there, kill the pyromancer, and strangle Cercei, completing the prophecy of Maggy the Frog.

Sansa

Sansa will be on the run from Ramsey for a time, but will eventually escape (maybe Brienne sacrifices herself). She will rally the northern lords (QUEENINDANORF?) and take over much of Stannis storyline, such as the mountain clans and retaking Deepwood Motte (capturing Yara/Asha). She might reveal herself to be a great general like her brother, or maybe Stannis, if spared by Lady Brienne might be her general as a form of redemption.

Petyr Baelish

Petyr might take Moat Cailin and continue north to aid in the fight against the Boltons. Could encounter Howland Reed. 

Jon

Jon will be revived by Melisandre, learn Targ parentage (Bran Weirwood Tower of Joy vision? White hair?), kill her for burning Shireen and Longclaw becomes all flamey. Azor Ahai. Alliser Thorne will probably confess why he hated him (being sent to the wall after Roberts Rebellion).

The Hound

In the books Brienne is the one who visits the quiet isle and sees the Grave digger. Since she is the the North right now I think Robin Arryn will take her place. Earlier this season we saw that Robin was touring the Vale and it is possible that he will visit the quiet isle and the Hound/Gravedigger will be revealed. Then GET HYPE CAUSE CLEGANEBOWL IS COMING BITCHES!

That's all for now, I might put a few more in the comment section.

I believe Jon is dead. Mel might bring him back or bring his body (along with davos as an escort) to Thoros, we know he can do this. Jon will take leadership of the brotherhood and fellow lady Stonehearts story from there. He might march them against Ramsay or just hang out in a cave for the rest of the seasons. Well until the white walkers come.

Mel said she'll meet arya again or their paths will cross agian..something like that. So what if arya gets an assignment to join Jon's new group, when she completes her training. What if the group catches up with sansa and theon.

This seems to be the overwhelmingly favourite theory on show forums. It's almost always tied to an assumption that Jon and Mel then travel the North, rallying the Houses, (who are apparently very psyched to hear that R+L=J) retake Winterfell and crown Jon King of the North, and possibly the Seven Kingdoms.
I have a lot of problems with this:  

1) *Why would revealing R+L=J increase his appeal to the Northern lords?*  

So the Lords find out that Jon is NOT Ned Starks son. They find out he's Rhaegar Targaryens son. This is a plus for the Northern Lords how? The Targaryens executed their Lord and his heir, in pretty awful circumstances. The North went to war, and thousands died, because Rhaegar kidnapped and raped Lyanna. They'd be thrilled to find out Jon is his son, why? They have Sansa, a child of Neds. So why look for someone else to rally behind? Especially the illegitimate son of the sworn foe.  


2) *Why would being aligned with a Red Priestess increase Jons appeal to the Northern Lords?*

The North is the land of the Old Gods. So how is any association between Jon and R'Hllor a plus? How is it not a negative? Especially given that it's Melisandre. Who was responsible for the destruction of Stannis' army, and the death of Stannis, Selyse and Shireen. How does the North wrap their minds around the fact that Jon is now associating with a red witch responsible for the horrific sacrifice of the last true Baratheon heir?   

3) *Why would the Northern Lords be happy to follow the LC who was so despised by his brothers that they assassinated him for allowing the Wildlings through the Wall?*  

Memory of the Walkers has failed, but knowledge of the Wildlings is very much alive, as is knowledge of their marauding and massacring south of the Wall. So letting them through the Wall is not likely to be any more popular among the Northern Lords than it was among the NW.  


4) *How is Jon going to do any of this rallying or fighting with no army, no men, no resources, no support?*  

Jon was unable to rally any support for the NW from the Northern Houses when he was LC. What has substantially changed that will change this apathy? Much seems to have changed that makes their support even less likely, not more likely.  

5) *Jons last remaining allies are the Wildlings. They're supposed to be OK with Jons new best friend, the red witch of R'Hllor?*

This just seems completely unlikely, if not impossible.  

So bottom line, I just don't see that the story has developed in a way that makes Jons resurrection by Mel a positive that catalyzes Jon's transformation into the presumptive heir of Winterfell who rallies the North and defeats the Boltons. Unless she dies resurecting him, in a Mirri Maz Duuz type of situation where Davos ties her to Jon's funeral pyre.",90,18,False,self,,,,,

##2.09 - ""Blackwater""

* Directed By: Neil Marshall
* Written By: George R. R. Martin
* Originally Aired: May 27, 2012

Stannis Baratheon's fleet assaults King's Landing in the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Leading the defense, Tyrion Lannister destroys many of the attacking craft with an exploding ship full of wildfire, and is forced to lead a counterattack as King Joffrey and his bodyguard Sandor Clegane each desert the battlefield. Stannis' forces make it inside the castle, but Tyrion leads his men behind the Baratheon forces via underground tunnels and attacks. Meanwhile, Queen Regent Cersei, holed up in the fortress with Sansa Stark and the other ladies of the court, succumbs to wine and despondency as she believes the battle lost. In the nick of time, as she is about to poison her son Tommen, Tywin Lannister's forces, joined by Loras Tyrell, the lover of Renly Baratheon, arrive to dispatch the attackers.

---

##2.10 - ""Valar Morghulis""

* Directed By: Alan Taylor
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 3, 2012

The aftermath of the Battle of the Blackwater sees Joffrey set Sansa aside in favor of marrying Margaery Tyrell while Tyrion fears for his and Shae's safety now that his father has replaced him as Hand of the King. Melisandre gives the defeated Stannis a new hope. Brienne runs into trouble while escorting Jaime to King's Landing. Catelyn tries to convince Robb that his romance with Talisa is dangerous, but he defies her and the two are married. In Qarth, Daenerys ventures into the House of the Undying and successfully retrieves her dragons. She then seals the traitor Xaro Xhoan Daxos inside his own vault and claims his riches for herself to buy a ship. In Winterfell, Theon is betrayed by his own men in the face of an inevitable siege while Winterfell is put to the torch. Osha and Hodor sneak brothers Bran and Rickon away from the smoldering ruins and take them North toward the Wall. Arya, having escaped Harrenhal with Hot Pie and Gendry, receives the gift of a valuable coin from Jaqen. North of the Wall, Qhorin Halfhand forces Jon to kill him to prove his loyalty to the Wildlings and an army of White Walkers surrounds the Fist of the First Men.

Having plans for Sansa makes sense, ruling North through her also makes sense but to leave such prize in hands of people who will clearly use it to their advt makes no sense whatever. Maybe I am missing the point or there is more to it in books, if anyone can shed light it will be great. At this point when I am appreciating how LF caused this whole thing, it just seems huge misstep on his part (also there is some pangs about Sansa's fate in S5)""). I dont mind spoilers from books if thats what takes to explain LF's position.

So, at the end of ADWD, Varys returns and murders Kevan Lannister and Grand Maester Pycelle, in order to pave the way for Young Griff/Aegon. On the show, however, Young Griff has apparently been cut, and if the season 5 finale is any indication, Varys will probably be in Meereen for a while. So, how then will Kevan and Pycelle die? And when do you think it will happen?

I'm guessing it won't happen right when Season 6 begins. They'll spend some time showing Kevan trying to put the realm back together, fix the mistakes Cersei made, while Pycelle keeps being, well, Pycelle. Make sure the audience cares about these characters before they're offed. They'll also take care to show that they're pretty much the only stabilizing force in the capitol, as well as House Lannister's last true hold on power, so their deaths will make it very clear that the shit's going to hit the fan now. I'm guessing it'll happen around mid-season.

As for how it happens, that's a bit more tricky. Some have speculated that, after Cersei learns of Myrcella's death, she'll basically go off the deep end and have FrankenGregor slay anyone she sees as a traitor (so pretty much everyone). That feels too contrived and anti-climactic to me, though. When Varys killed them in the books, it marked his triumphant return after a long absence and the moment when he finally revealed his true allegiance. Besides, if Cersei actually did that, then the gold cloaks/Red Keep guards would probably just kill her on sight, when we all know she'll die at the valonqar's hands.

As for my personal theory, I'm wondering if the Iron Bank of Braavos might somehow be involved. After Mace finishes his talks, the IB might realize that there's no way Westeros will be able to repay them (especially with Stannis defeated), so they'll hire some Faceless Men (including Arya) to ""send a message"" to the Iron Throne, so to speak. Also, the viewer has been frequently told that the Iron Bank is one of the most fearsome and ruthless entities in the world (even Tywin is afraid of them), but we haven't seen them actually do anything to back up that reputation. Something like this would be a perfect way to show that they are what people say they are. (It would also be a good way to tie in Arya's storyline with Westeros)

A bit crackpot, I know, but I couldn't think of much else. What are your theories?",10,13,False,self,,,,,

There are multiple examples of Targaryens who do not have the normal Targaryen features, and I have gathered a list here that was originally [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/29yiwa/spoilers_all_targaryens_without_silvergold/) over on /r/asoiaf over a year ago by /u/Garntus. 


* Jacerys Velaryon - Son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon or Harwin Strong (much more likely). Brown hair and brown eyes. 

* Lucerys Velaryon - Son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon or Harwin Strong (much more likely). Brown hair and brown eyes. 

* Joffrey Velaryon - Son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon or Harwin Strong (much more likely). Brown hair and brown eyes. 

* Elaena Targaryen - Daughter of Aegon III Targaryen and Daenera Velaryon: Platinum white hair with a golden streak, unknown eye colour.

* Aegor Rivers - Son of Aegon IV Targaryen and Barbra Bracken: Black hair and purple eyes

* Bloodraven - Son of Aegon IV Targaryen and Melissa Blackwood: White hair and red eyes (albinism). 

* Shiera Seastar - Daughter of Aegon IV Targaryen and Serenei of Lys: Silver-gold hair and one blue eye and one green. 

* Baelor ""Breakspear"" Targaryen - Son of Daeron II Targaryen and Myriah Martell: Dark hair and unknown eye colour. 

* Valarr Targaryen - Son of Baelor Breakspear: Dark hair with ""silver-golden drill"" and blue eyes. 

* Daeron Targaryen - Son of Maekar I Targaryen: Sandy brown hair and a blonde beard, unknown eye colour. 

* Rhaenys Targaryen - Daughter of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell: Brown hair, unknown eye colour. 

Hopefully this helps! Genetics are strange in the world of ASOIAF. GRRM has stated that genes work somewhat differently in his world, such as every child between a Baratheon and a blonde haired women will always have the Baratheon features of dark hair, which is how Ned found out about Cersei's children. But we can definitely see from history that not every person with a Targaryen parent will always have either the silver hair or the purple eyes.

If R+L=J is true, it just seems like Stark traits override Targaryen traits in Jon Snow's case.",11,31,False,self,,,,,

The purpose of bloodline succession is to prevent wars when a king dies - by presenting a rule for who should rule that avoids conflict.  Of the previous four kings in Westeros - only one was the rightful heir and only one succession took place without serious bloodletting and political turmoil.  Conclusion:  Bloodline succession is broken in Westeros - pretenders sit on the throne of a usurper. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3eu8dx/all_spoilers_thoughts_on_who_is_the_rightful_heir/

Expanding this further - not only has bloodline succession poorly served Westeros - the Mad King may have been mad, in part, due to Targaryn inbreeding - to keep the bloodline pure and because other mates ""aren't good enough"".  Clearly this is not in the interests of the realm.  And now some speculate that Rh'hlor's power can be invoked not with the blood of kings - which is bad enough - but with only the blood of Targaryn kings.  

Having said all this - my worry about Game of Thrones is that GRRM will restore it.  And I don't want that - in fact - ""the wheel"" that I want to break is Daenerys'.  To the extent R+L=J is true - it disqualifies Jon in my view - I don't want no stinking Targaryns.   

Many redditors seem to want to know who is the rightful king and have them restored but that is antithetical for us.  A caste system separating those of noble blood from the ""small folk"" is not one most of us should feel great about.  We are small folk.  Being lesser by blood should be abhorrent to us.

Why do we like the Starks?  
  - they have a functional family life with apparent affection &amp; respect - they at least know what this is
  - they teach responsibility and not priviledge with things like women making their own dresses and the man that makes the judgement weilds the sword, etc.. 
  - their most famous ancestor is ""Bran the BUilder"" not ""Bran the Conqueror""...

I'll take Baelish over ""entitled"" privileged princes - secret or otherwise.  Whether through guile or strength of arms - some form of meritocracy seems superior to the junky caste system Westeros has now.  And most modern people - who value diversity (genetic and cultural) and self-improvement and opportunity -  if they think about it - would likely agree.  

I know it's a fantasy but I don't want to invest this much in something so alien to my personal ethic.  It's not about good and evil - it's about right and wrong.  Privilege of blood is wrong.

Sounds really strange but since he is a Lannister other houses that are loyal to the Lannisters might go in his aid since he presents a much bigger treat with Dany's army than the Lannisters of King's Landing do and in theory they wouldn't be breaking their ""vows"". Idk if he is still considered Sansa's husbands but i'm guessing not since Ramsay married her.

2) How is the relation between Greyjoys in the books? Since Victarion and Euron are possibly appearing on the series i would like to know.

3) Will Arya be set free after completing her training or will she run away from Pentos? We've seen she filming in Riverlands so its safe to assume she will leave Pentos in a way or the other. If she gets to be free how does the Many Faced God tell her who she has to kill next?

4) Has any fan theory become true?

5) I've read people say Stannis has some Targaryen blood, why is that?

6) With Stannis most likely dead who do you think will get Dragonstone? That person will most likely have a really big role in upcoming seasons since Dragonstone may have the Dragonglass to fight the White Walkers

7) Can the Valonqar be a sister or does the word stand for the masculine of sibling?

8) How does the Iron Bank deal with people who don't pay their bets, like the Lannisters, ironically, are doing at this point in the series? Or even with Stannis since he might be dead?

Thank you for participating/answering and have a nice day!

Is there a difference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3k9d4w/all_spoilers_everything_wargs_and_skinchangers_is/,CourtsideCorey,1441815398,"Working my way through my third read through of the books, and am currently reading the Varamyr Six Skins chapter. Had a couple thoughts, and if they have been brought up before, I apologize.

&amp;nbsp;

So on most of the posts I read, it seems that Warg and Skinchanger is used interchangeably, but in Varamyr's chapter he states. ""Haggon had taken him to a gathering of such. The wards were the most numerous in that company, the wolf brothers, but the boy had found the others stranger and more fascinating.""  He then goes on to list others who use animals other than wolves.

&amp;nbsp;

So does this line imply that wargs only use wolves, and skinchangers use any animal they like, along with other people like Bran uses Hodor? Also of note in the chapter, and perhaps important to Jon, Varamyr notes that he believes his ability will die with his original body, despite his spirit living on.

&amp;nbsp;

Varamyr also notes that Jon was a skinchanger, and not a warg, as ""one skinchanger can always sense another.""

&amp;nbsp;

I know the whole chapter is one big setup for Jon's resurrection, but still found the difference between warg and skingchanger important.

The theory would also suggest that (as we suspect) Ashara did not commit suicide (body never found according to GRRM), but is living with Howland under the name Jyana (Jon + Lyanna).

I remember reading an interview during or right before Season 5 from the actress who played Obara.

The actress felt that she was a good fit for Obara, she tried out, and she got the part. 

All 3 of the Sand Snakes were meh, but I found Obara the least convincing.

I just don't even. I think GoT is such a well-written show overall and Dorne is like this big ugly storm cloud hovering over the series. Dorne was just plain bizarre.

I come to you with a dilemma.
So for the past couple of years I've been a lurker on this subreddit and the nosleep one. But yeah, I've read all the books and seen all of the show and everything and I am a crazy crazy huge fan (: I've always marveled at the iron throne, how powerful and prestigious it is and how crazy it is that everyone in the serious wants to sit on what's been described as the world's most uncomfortable chair. But then again so do I. 
Yes, you guessed it, I want to borrow someone's iron throne.
As a poorish high school student I could never dream of owning such a majesty, so for my senior portrait I want to take my photo on the iron throne. Thankfully, I'm blessed by living in LA, so if anyone in Southern California would be willing to let me borrow their throne for an afternoon I would be eternally grateful! It would be a dream come true to even be in the presence of the subject of the thousands of pages I've read, the hundreds of hours I've watched. Now, I take my portrait next summer, so there's quite a big chunk of time for a potential person willing to let me borrow their throne to get to know me and see what kind of person I am.
So please, 
If you have an iron throne please consider lending it to me for just a few hours! you would make my dreams come true!

Women could also do a lot of stuff at the wall even if they don't go ranging and fighting, basically what the stewards do at the moment. Then, if it's allowed for men to have children there would be more people at the wall which is always a good thing. The children then will be given the choice between also taking the black or going away when they come of age. But since they only know mom and dad at the wall they probably will stay there. I think it would also improve the men's strength when there are women around which they want to impress.

Now, the main counter argument would be ""Love is the death of duty"". But think you it: Let's assume the wall gets attacked and you have a child and a women you love at the wall. Wouldn't this increase your fighting morale if you know you're not only fighting for your life but for that of your family? Why should normal soldiers be allowed to have family and noone cares about them valuing family over duty, but when it comes to the NW, it suddenly matters?

You could also argue that it would distract you, but I don't think that would happen. Are the Stark guards distracted by their family when it comes to protecting their lords? Probably not, you can still have time with them when you're not on a watch at the moment.

This remains a pretty likely scenario, but there are some alternative explanations floating around as well. Some quick ones that come to mind are:  

1) Everyone is attacking Jon and the Wildlings. 

2) Everyone is attacking an army of CGI'd wights. 

3) The CGI'd Walkers/Wights are attacking everyone else. 

4) The armies are all fighting each other to install their ruler as King of Winterfell. LF/Vale + Sansa (or Tommen?). Umbers/Northern Houses + Rickon. Boltons/Freys + Roose. Wildlings + Jon.  

5) Undead Jon-Wight is attacking everyone with an army of wights/Walkers. 

6) Undead Jon is attacking the Boltons with an army of resurrected dead Starks and Wildlings and a direwolf army full of warged CofTF.  

7) The Boltons are attacking House Umber, which is defended by the other Northern Houses and an army of Jon + Wildlings.  

We still don't know so many things, especially:  

 
- Where is the battle being waged?  

- What are the motivations of the players?  

So I say keep tinfoiling. No need for premature consensus at this point.

Many of the elements on it are based on spoilers and rumors on what's going to be in season 6 taken from this sub, WoTW, and Los Siete Reinos. (OK...It's a fanfic mashup of some things we know so far). What do you think?

Since it's a teaser trailer, it only shows some storylines to keep it short (~35 seconds). There could be another which shows the rest (Arya/Braavos, Kings Landing, Riverlands/Brienne, Mereen/Tyrion, and Dany)

1. Start with a wide outside shot of Castle Black and the Wall that zooms in slowly until we can see smoke coming up from the courtyard over the battlements. We never get to see what is actually going on inside, but the smoke is coming from [Jon's funeral pire.](http://winteriscoming.net/2015/08/09/rumored-pictures-of-jon-snows-funeral-at-castle-black-surface/)

2. We see Sean Bean as Ned praying on the Winterfell Godswood. The screen then cuts to Bran Stark as he exits the ""warg state"" and recovers conciusness. We see Bloodraven and he speaks: 
&gt;""Men forget. Only the trees remember""

3. We then see a crow flying over the North, and in the distance we see armies getting ready for [battle](http://watchersonthewall.com/game-of-thrones-gets-theatrical-plus-massive-spoilers-for-season-six/#more-44852)

4. A mist covers the battle scene as the crow passes through a cloud. When the mist is gone, we now see the longship *Silence* arriving and Old Wyk. (Or wherever D&amp;D decide to do the [Kingsmoot](http://watchersonthewall.com/sources-report-euron-cast-major-scene-filmed-today-in-ballintoy-harbour/)) (PS: This is a teaser so you don't get to see Euron yet, just his ship.)

5. A sweeping shot of the Citadel and Oldtown just to introduce this new location.


.


At last, the screen fades to black and a voice speaks:

&gt;""And now it begins""

On the dark screen we start to see a flash of light: it's the blade of a sword being unsheathed. The light takes   over the whole screen as the other voice speaks:

&gt;""No. Now it ends""

My guess is it doesn't necessarily have to be a spouse, just your most beloved person. IMO this is definitely Shireen, he has a cold relationship with Selyse and Davos is more of a good friend. So I know how you all hate Stannis now after what he did. However, in the world of Game of Thrones, the most righteous and moral people do not mostly win in the end, the tale of Azor Ahai is a very bittersweet one as he must kill his most beloved so he can save the world.

Right now we know of two weapons that can kill others, Dragonglass and Valyrian Steel, which is probably dragonsteel. I would assume that dragon breath can also kill them, but this is not proven yet. In the show, the coldness of the Others parts the flames. So what if Lightbringer is not actually a sword but fire itself. Fire is hot and bright. Fire was also used to kill Shireen so he metaphorically ""plunged"" the sword into his ""Nissa Nissa"". So somehow now because Melisandre oversaw the burning her fires are now maybe super magical Other killing fire? so maybe if she makes some fire powder or fire balls they will kill the Others and Mr. Azor Ahai Stannis will be able to mass produce these things and kill the Others. This part is speculative on the logistics of the Other killing but it is of my belief that Lightbringer is fire itself. 

So really how does Azor Ahai plan on defeating the enemy if Dragonglass and Valyrian Steel aren't very common? Maybe dragon breath can kill them but there are only 3 dragons and it would seem dumb that 3 dragons that could not even conquer all of Westeros could just defeat the HUGE Other threat, which has been made to seem like the major enemy of the series. One practical explanation is some sort of mass produced fire weapon that is blessed by the sacrifice of Shireen Baratheon.

This is where Stannis is redeemed. His conscience is heavily weighed down by his evil deed, and it looks like he was just being a dummie zealot as he killed his daughter and lost the battle. BTW Brienne doesn't kill Stannis. IDK how but Stannis survives ppl come up with theories on this now. He feels like giving up, he has no army, the Red Woman has abandoned him and he is a kinslayer two times over. But you know what, Stannis the Mannis doesn't give up, everyone might hate him but you know, he never really cared about that and only cares about the right thing. At this point he will have admitted his own evil in his heart of the deed he did so we can all go a little easier on him, he realizes that he was a bad guy and blinded by ""R'hollor"". 

Stannis then realizes as he is healing from Brienne attack/whatever about the original Azor Ahai and what happened. So he's like.... WAIT IT MIRRORS EXACTLY WHAT I DID AM I ACTUALLY AZOR AHAI? He feels like he's off the hook from the sacrifice. But then he realizes he isn't and this is his pinnacle of character development, he is still guilty of his kinslaying/murderous burning alive of an innocent little girl, but this was ACCIDENTALLY necessary for saving the world. I feel this is important. Then cause he's a smart fellow he realizes that fire is Lightbringer, etc., etc.",14,0,False,self,,,,,

This post does indeed have major spoilers for every book and season.**

Resubmitting this; mods thought the original title was too spoiler-y.

One line of discussion I've read a lot here lately is ""Character X *can't* be dead because they died off-screen!  It's Film School 101.""  Ignoring for a moment that this Game of Thrones has a penchant for outright ignoring Film School 101 standards, I think it's a bit ridiculous on separate grounds.  There are tons of characters who've died off-screen to an extent that if and off-screen death is no death, there are quite a lot of people still kicking around.  I've compiled a list as best I can recall limited to named characters.  For a few cases, where a character isn't given a specific name but has a title they're referred to by, I've included them.  If anyone remembers one that I've forgotten please chime in!

[S1 Ep2](#s ""**Lady** As retribution for biting Joffrey, Robert Baratheon orders Arya's dire wolf, Nymeria, killed.  Arya however had anticipated this and chased Nymeria away to protect her life.  In her stead, Robert accepts Lady's death as an acceptable substitute.  We see Ned Stark comfort the wolf and draw his knife as the camera pans away.  The shot ends without visual or audio confirmation of the death."")

[S1 Ep7](#s ""**Benjen Stark**  In a previous episode, Benjen ranged north of The Wall on a mission to determine the cause of recent Ranger deaths and to scout movements of the Wildlings converging on a common area.  In this episode, Benjen's horse returns uninjured but alone.  The question of what happened to Benjen is raised but isn't answered.  Until the finale of Season 5, Benjen is only mentioned once- by Lord Commander Mormont when he tells Jon that the Night's Watch will set out in force north of the Wall to get answers."")

[S1 Ep7](#s ""**The Wine Seller** The end result of Robert's order to Varys to have Daenerys assassinated, a wine seller offers her a sample of a poisoned wine.  Knowledgeable of the impending attempt on her life, Jorah reveals the scheme.  The wine seller tries the flee but is apprehended by Rakharo and taken to Khal Drogo.  His execution is ordered in a novel form- he's to be stripped naked and tied to Daenerys's horse on the next march, and when he collapses from exhaustion will be dragged to his death.  Though we see him stripped, bound, and tripping, he's alive when the shot ends and his death is not imminent.  No confirmation of his death ever occurs, direct or indirect."")

[S1 Ep7](#s ""**Robert Baratheon** Robert suffers mortal wounds while on a boar hunt in the Kingswood.  The last time we see Robert is early in the episode when he dictates to Ned his orders for succession of the throne.  When the scene ends Robert is clearly wounded and in great agony, but still alive.  We learn that he's dead when a messenger summons Ned to the Iron Throne on the behalf of King Joffrey.  Robert's death is particularly notable because he's the one highborn character to die in King's Landing (along with Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Joffrey Baratheon, and Tywin Lannister) who we don't see attended to by the Silent Sisters.  Moreso, Jon, Joffrey, and Tywin were all given post-death scenes as displayed in the Great Sept of Baelor but Robert was not."")

[S1 Ep9](#s ""**Rhaego** A power struggle among the khalasar ensues concomitant to the impending death of Khal Drogo.  During an altercation over her permission for Mirri Maz Duur to treat Drogo's wounds, Qotho attacks Daenerys and sends her into premature labor.  Ser Jorah realizes that Daenerys requires medical attention and extremely short on options, he carries her into the tent where The Witch is performing blood magic on Drogo.  We're later told that the child was stillborn but never see proof."")

[S1 Ep10](#s ""**Mirri Maz Duur** As retribution for killing her child and disabling her husband, Daenerys orders The Witch bound to her husband's funeral pyre.  We don't see any remains in the one scene of the pyre the following morning.  You could argue that there are witnesses to the death, but all the same people also assumed they saw Daenerys die.  It seems likely that the audience made assumptions about what was happening in the pyre without being able to actually see anything.  In contrast to the similar execution of Shireen, we don't have tacit confirmation of the death in the subtitles.  You could present the case that The Witch is dead before the pyre scene ends but there's no hard evidence of this."")

[S2 Ep9](#s ""**Matthos Seaworth** Ser Davos's son, Matthos is present in a command position on the same ship as Davos as Stannis Baratheon's fleet sails into The Blackwater.  Davos warns Matthos to take cover just before the fireship explodes, but it is too late and Matthos is thrown by the explosion.  One could argue that this is indeed and on-screen death, but Davos is also thrown by the blast in very similar fashion and is later shown to have survived.  By the way, I'm just realizing that we've had three major characters go missing in the waters between King's Landing and Dragonstone."")

[S2 Ep10](#s ""**Xaro Xhoan Daxos** and **Doreah** Concerned that Daenerys was dithering over his marriage proposals, Xaro, with the help of Doreah, launched a plan to capture Daenerys and her dragons in the House of the Undying and kill her contingent of bodyguards.  The plan backfires after Daenerys orders her dragons to immolate the warlock Pyat Pree, releasing them from their bonds and the House.  Daenrys and her small number of remaining bodyguards return to Xaro's mansion to find him in bed with Doreah.  After opening his Valyrian stone vault to find it empty, she orders Xaro and Doreah entombed inside of it.  No confirmation of their deaths is made, nor does any character ever refer to them again."")

[S4 Ep10](#s ""**Sandor Clegane** While escorting Arya Stark, The Hound and Arya meet Brienne of Tarth.  When Brienne realizes the identity of Arya she informs her of allegiance to Lady Catelyn and her sworn oath to protect her and Sansa.  At the culmination of a confrontation-turned-battle over the right to protect Arya, Brienne throws The Hound from a cliff.  He suffers a serious fracture of his leg and tells Arya that he'll die of it.  After begging Arya for a mercy killing, Arya takes his gold and walks away.  No confirmation of his presumed death is given, though in contrast to Xaro and Doreah characters do later reference it."")

[S5 Ep10](#s ""**Stannis Baratheon** Following his Quixhotic attempt to besiege Winterfell, Stannis is badly wounded before being found by Brienne of Tarth.  She confronts and accuses him of using blood magic to assassinate his brother Renly.  Stannis admits to the crime and instructs her to ""do your duty"" when she sentences him to death.  We see Brienne swing a sword at Stannis and the scene cuts away just as it would presumably decapitate the would-be King.  With the one difference in that we don't actually see Stannis as the sword is swung, the scene is framed and edited quite similarly to Ned Stark's execution."")  Speaking of which...

[S1 Ep9](#s ""*Honorable Mention* **Ned Stark**  This is an honorable mention for two reasons but I still feel that it properly warrants mention in this list.  The first issue is that if you go frame-by-frame through the execution the shot cuts away just as the sword passes through Ned's neck.  Cutting away the instant before Ned is run through with a sword is what I believe the intent was here.  For this reason, the actual moment of Ned's death was not intended to occur on-screen, even if the events right up to it were.  The second issue is that we see proof of his death in the following episode in the form of his head mounted on a pike.  That said, that reinforces my overall point.  Sometimes we don't actually *see* a character die, but it turns out later that yes, they did indeed die.  You can characterize the deaths of The Tickler, Ros, and Khal Drogo (he was still twitching when that shot ended) in much the same way."")

----------------------------------------------------

What's the bottom line?  If being given an off-screen death means that a character is not in fact dead, there are a whole shit ton of people kicking around in Westeros and Essos who we've wrongly assumed to be dead.  Lastly, this is devoid of commentary on the relative likelihood of any of the aforementioned characters being alive or dead.  It's simply a list of characters implied to have died or been killed off-screen.  If we accept a hard-and-fast rule that off-screen deaths are misdirects and actually imply a character is living, these are the characters for whom exists an argument of not being dead.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

But, heavens to Betsy I've never heard this theory about Jon Snow's parents before. My friends say I'm crazy but I think it is clearly possible. Please let me know what you think.       
  
  As my user name is a big spoiler to my ""solid"" theory you might of guessed that I think Jon Snows father is none other than The Bearded Beefcake ""Robert Baratheon: First of his name"". Hear me out. Many people already think Lyanna Stark is Jon Snow's mother which I believe. Now, some people think Rhaegar Targaryan is Jon Snows father. Plausible and obvious for sure. Once, you know the true identity of his mother is Lyanna. Now, we should know that GOT is full of twists and turns and rarely the obvious answer is the correct one.  
 
  Lyanna Stark is described as a fiery and tough lady. Much like an adult Arya yet very beautiful. With all the sex in the show and books , I believe that she was sleeping with both Robert Baratheon and Rhaegar Targaryan. Because why not??  They were both hunks. Something bad happened with Robbie Baratheon and that forced her into Rhaegar's Arms or she finally chose Rhaegar over Robert. Her and Rhaegar then ran away together which started Roberts Rebellion. I bet that before all that happened, Robert's strong Battle Ax sperm impregnated Lyanna. Remember his SEED IS STRONG. 
   
   Cut to that whole war thing and Lyanna and Rhaegar being killed. But, not before proud Neddy Stark promises his sister to keep her baby safe. Ned makes up the false bastard story and keeps his secret and promise. He truly was an honorable man!  Fast forward many years. In the First book and episode, when they find the litter of Dire Wolves. After their mother is killed by a Stag (symbolism of Baratheon House symbol taking down Starks AGAIN). Jon's wolf does not look like the other wolves. As Jon doesn't look like the Stark Children.
  
  Jon Snow's hair is Jet Black. Remember all the Baratheon bastards are ""Black of hair"". If he was half Targaryan you think he would have at least some lighter hair. With Rhaegar having that damn white hair. Why is Jon's so dark?  His mother and all the other Starks have a brown or dark brown head of hair. Also, Snow crossing paths with his ""Uncle"" Stannis is a bit convenient. Stannis likes him. The red woman can sense the blood of a King or great power in Jon Snow. The red woman is at the wall to bring Jon back to life (my guess). He will then be released of his Knights Watch Vow. He will be the heir to both the Stark and Baratheon Land claims at that point. And, perhaps will go on to marry Dani Targaryan to finally bring peace to the realm. Remember that Tyrion Lannister who really likes Jon Snow is there now with Dani to hopefully bring them together.   Who wouldn't want to see that??
   
   Did I just solved the ""unwritten"" mystery??  Here we go. Also, I typed this on a mobile phone on vacation in Finland. Also, if I messed up the bracketing rules in the title I apologize. Still learning.

Thanks for your time !

The assumption that because Jon dies and is resurrected he is released from his NW vows. This is how I think of it. If you die, lets say from a massive heart attack, and are resurrected through the marvels of modern medicine (yes it happens. I'm in the biz and have seen it more than once), you are absolutely not released from your vows. You are still married, even though your vows say ""till death do us part"". You still have all of your debts and legal obligations. They don't disappear just because you were dead for a bit. It just does not happen. It also is not true that a convicted criminal who survives an attempted execution is now free and released. The law is clear. They still have a death penalty and they will be executed a second time. So I really don't understand this ""released from his vows"" stuff. If I had to guess, I'd say it comes from a desire to see Jon leave the Wall and get more involved in the affairs of Westeros. But I don't think you have to stretch it that far. There are many other possible and probable ways for that to happen.  

- He could be released from his vows once resurrected. Kicked out of the NW    

- The NW could essentially be destroyed, likely by the Wildlings avenging Jon's death, or by the Walkers. So no NW to remain loyal to. Free agent still bound by vows to protect.  

- The NW could agree to go south and do battle, if that's where the Walkers are.  

I just think it flies in the face of what we know about Jons character that he would try to weasel out of his vows on a legal technicality. I also don't see a really good way for him to not be considered a deserter by the first northern lord he runs into. ""I was dead, but now I'm not"" seems a bit of a stretch for them to believe. So bottom line, I think a resurrected Jon will still honour his vows to protect Westeros. There may no longer be a NW for him to fight with. The Wall may be down. But he will continue the fight with whatever forces he can gather.",177,32,False,self,,,,,

During is dead period a new lord commander is going to be elected, probably alliser thorne. The wall is not going to crumble it will remain as always. But later jon gets ressurected to find a new lord commander in place. A standof is likely to rise with a few men siding with the current lord commander while a few side with jon. Instead of this standoff degenerating to violence the people will reach an agreement and expel jon with his folowers from the wall. Davos, Mel, Edd, Tormund a few wildlings n nights watch loyal to jon will leave for winterfell to build a defense against white walkers just incase the wall doesn't hold. The wall is likely to remain fairly operational for the whole season. However in episode 10, we may possibly witness a white walker invasion that annihilates remaining night's watch....the wall will come down n winter begins proper with the walkers able to venture farther south.,....making sense to anyone?",56,22,False,self,,,,,

Remember the good ol' days when your favorite characters were still alive?  Go back and watch old episodes with the benefit of hindsight!  How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

##3.01 - ""Valar Dohaeris""

* Directed By: Daniel Minahan
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: March 31, 2013

Some Night's Watch men, Samwell Tarly and Lord Commander Mormont among them, survive the White Walkers' attack and pledge to return to the Wall to warn the Seven Kingdoms. Jon Snow is brought before Mance Rayder, the ""King beyond the Wall"", and pledges his loyalty to the Wildlings. A scarred Tyrion Lannister unsuccessfully solicits recognition by his father Tywin, the new Hand of the King. Margaery Tyrell engages in charity work with the orphans of King's Landing. Ser Davos Seaworth is rescued by Salladhor Saan after the Battle of the Blackwater and returned to Dragonstone. There, he unsuccessfully tries to kill Melisandre so as to break her hold on Stannis Baratheon, and is imprisoned. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen arrives in the city of Astapor to buy an army of brutally-trained slave soldiers, the ""Unsullied"". She is saved from an assassination attempt by the warlocks of Qarth by Ser Barristan Selmy, the former Kingsguard commander, who pledges his loyalty.

##3.02 - ""Dark Wings, Dark Words""

* Directed By: Daniel Minahan
* Written By: Vanessa Taylor
* Originally Aired: April 7, 2013

Brienne escorts Jaime across the Riverlands to King's Landing. Seizing one of her swords, he engages her in a fight, which is interrupted by Bolton armsmen. After he receives the news of the sack of Winterfell and the disappearance of Bran and Rickon, Robb diverts his attentions from the war against the Lannisters to attend Catelyn's father's funeral in Riverrun, angering Lord Karstark, who seeks vengeance for his sons who were killed by Jaime. Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie also make for Riverrun, but are waylaid by a rebel group, the ""Brotherhood without Banners"", and are taken to an inn, where the captured Hound reveals Arya's identity. Margaery Tyrell and her grandmother Olenna, the ""Queen of Thorns"", convince Sansa to tell them about Joffrey's flawed character. Theon Greyjoy is tortured by unknown captors. Bran, Rickon, Osha and Hodor encounter the siblings Jojen and Meera Reed, children of the Stark bannerman Howland Reed. Jojen, who has been sharing Bran's strange dreams, tells Bran that he is a warg, able to enter the minds of animals.

It lead him to make some poor decisions and ultimately to his death, which could have likely been avoided had his honor not been so burdensome. Specifically, when Renly comes to him before Robert's Death and urges him to move in on the Lannisters and Ned just waits for her to flee the city...

My question is: How did this never cause him any trouble in his past? Is the North just that much more honorable than King's Landing (it likely is, but still you'd think some dishonorable people could pose problems for Ned at some point). Did he just never have to deal with any of this because he was basically Lord of Winterfell right after the war and above the games you see in the king's court? 

It just strikes me that he did so poorly in King's Landing that it would be hard to think it never was a problem for him in his past. Then again... He probably wouldn't be the way he was if it had been an issue, previously. ",34,8,False,self,,,,,

&gt;""It begins with the High Sparrow going down the Septs stairs while the people applaud him. He explains that Queen Margaery has joined them in accepting the power of the Faith. Just then, Jaime Lannister bursts into the scene, on horseback and leading an army of a hundred and forty Tyrell soldiers, and demands that the High Sparrow free Queen Margaery. ***Suddenly, the gates of the Great Sept open it is Tommen Baratheon, followed by Queen Margaery and the Kingsguards, who are bearing the Faith Militants sigil instead of the Royal sigil.***

&gt; The king and queen have accepted the High Sparrows reformed faith, and they are acclaimed by the people. It is emphasized that this is only the first part of the scene; the rest will be filmed today, and it is expected to be a trascendental scene in which the two factions come to blows.""

&gt;Confirming 4 things:

&gt;1) The High Sparrow is a genius, solidifying the hold of the Faith on the Crown. In practice, he is a Pope-King now.

&gt;2) The King basically answers to the High Sparrow from now on.

&gt;3) The Tyrells are back as major players, although they respond to the Faith as well.

&gt;4) Cersei is cornered by everything and everyone in King's Landing.

&gt;From (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/board/thread/248344205)[IMDB] and translated from the orginal report (http://www.elpuntavui.cat/cultura/article/19-cultura/895261-latac-al-temple.html?cca=1) [here]

Is it bad that after these spoilers...the idea of Cersei burning down King's Landing is literally making me salivate?

[All TV](#s ""For e.g. Lord Royce has last seen Sansa in good spirits (he may not be northern, so excuse me on that) but if and when he learns of her fate he maybe inclined to help a Stark.
Similarly some lady was brutalized in Season 2 by Ramsey, is her house capable enough to do something given a chance. Then there is major event towards end of S3, so could be survivors of those families who can have a grudge against Boltons."")

They are described as massively muscled, big-boned creatures with long arms, sloped foreheads, huge square teeth, heavy jaws, coarse black hair, flat noses that suggest snouts, and thick skins brindled in patterns of brown and white, making them seem more hoglike than human. This sounds to me like genetic mutations resulting from long nuclear exposure. There's also the fact that people not born on Sothoryos seems to get sick when they stay there to long. The [butterfly fever](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Butterfly_fever) that outsiders get when staying to long on the Island og [naath](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Naath) also resembles [Acute radiation syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome). Since Naath is located just of the coast of Sothoryos it would still feel the effects og nuclear fallout. How the naathi are immune to the effects i don't know. Maybe they're butterflies really are magical. A nuclear blast could also create a tidal wave, wich would explain how the arm of dorne became the stepstones.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

They're supposed to be trained in all sorts of things:
 
* types of weapons (mano e mano, sword, spear, etc), 
* types of fight (man to man, big battles, etc),
* probably other things too (though a change in climate might not be in their skill-set, so prepare to see them such the most in the North... that remembers).
 
But they couldn't win on at least two clear occasions! Despite having spears to keep the others (with daggers) on a distance, despite also having shields to hide behind; and despite their brothers-in-arms being right next to them to have use for a proper formation, they fail utterly, at least, considering their alleged reputation. Anyone have any idea why?

Here's where the real appreciation is- once Daenerys sets her mind to freeing the slaves of Slavers Bay, when she first appears to the masters of Yunkai, she is wearing a slave-style collar and a minimal slave-like robe to the master, obviously in plain sight of the slaves.

So Rhaegar and Lyanna had a baby, and it wasn't rape, in fact they eloped on their own, fell in love and had Jon Snow at the end of the war, which Ned Stark adopted.

What evidence do we have here? 

___
Evidence 1: The promise.

In book one, (cut from the show) Ned has a flashback-dream after being stabbed and knocked out.     
In it he remembers going to the tower of the joy, defended by three Kingsguard, Ser Artur Dayne, Ser Oswell Whent and Ser Gerold Hightower the Lord commander of the Kingsguard. So those are some HIGH level Kingsguard, and 3 of them no less. That's a big deal considering they where left behind as Rhaegar left to fight at the Trident, and as we know he could have used them.

Inside Ned Stark finds his sister Lyanna, in a bed of blood. And that is VERY important, she is lying in a Bed of Blood. She makes Ned promise her something, and then she dies.

And this is pretty much our biggest piece of evidence for the whole R+L=J thing, the bed of blood and the promise.      
Because here the assumptions are:

1. She just gave birth.
2. The act of giving birth in a medieval setting killed her.     
3. She stays alive long enough to make Ned promise her.
4. Her bed is still covered in blood from the birth, which brings us back to point 1.

So a mother dying, has just given birth, seen her son for the first time, knows she is dying, sees her dutiful brother, and what does she do? What any mother would do she wants her child taken care of. Hey, that makes all the sense in the world.     
However.     

____
Evidence 2: The Song.

In book 2 Daenerys goes through the tower of the undying. But cut from the show is one of her visions peering through one of the many doors of the tower.     
She sees a man that looks like her brother Viserys, only older and stronger. He has a harp and is playing a song for a brown haired girl lying in a bed, cradling a child.      
She asks him if he would compose a song for the child, and he replies: ""He has a song, he is the prince that was promised, his is the song of ice and fire.""     

Now THAT is some damn important foreshadowing, considering a song of ice and fire is the name of the whole damn book series.        
Applying this to what we already believe of the the R+L=J theory, we can make the following assumptions:

1. That is Rhaegar and Lyanna, cradling a newborn Jon Snow (whom they name Aegon).
2. This is the tower of joy.
3. This is the same bed Ned will find her in later.

Again, it makes sense and it reinforces the idea that Rhaegar never really kidnapped Lyanna but she wanted to go with him.       
Perhaps Rhaegar had even asked her father Rickard for her hand, but he had forbidden it. After all, Rhaegar might be Prince, but he is already married, allowing his daughter to be someones second wife is unheard of in the 7 kingdoms, as is divorce.

______
But there is a problem. The Timeline.

The tower of joy is in Western Dorne, in the mountains. Rhaegar died at the Trident in the Riverlands.       
If Rhaegar was with his newborn son singing songs with his harp, then rode to the trident to face Robert, that is WEEKS of riding at the very least. And on top of that he had to assemble, or at the very least join a host, then march that host to the Riverlands for battle. 

After the battle Ned goes straight to Kings Landing. Another week of riding, he arrives after the sack of Kings landing, and leaves fairly quickly again, and this time he is heading straight for the tower, but from Kings landing to Dorne is once again, several weeks of riding.

IF both evidence 1 and 2 are true, there is no way Ned Stark arrived at the Tower of Joy just as she had given birth, in fact he must have arrived MONTHS later. And that is a conservative estimate.

Which leaves a few important questions:

1. What killed Lyanna Stark?
2. Why was she in a bed of blood?
3. Why was she still at the tower?

We know through the dialogue that the three Kingsguard knew about the fate of Rhaegar and the mad king, why where they staying there? Why hadn't they moved Lyanna and the child East to join Daenerys and Viserys?

It has always troubled me that this theory, that is so widely accepted by the community retains this massive flaw. Lets discuss!    ",20,0,False,self,,,,,

That theory is that Jon Snow will return. Regardless of the spotting of Kit on set, there is so much of his character that is yet to be revealed (like his Targaryen lineage and the potential for him to be the reincarnation of Azor Ahai) which would suggest his return. This coupled with his warg abilities, the presence of the Red Woman at castle black, and Theon, who has kings blood in him, bringing Sansa to Castle Black solidifies his return in my opinion. 

Now for my theory, Im not sure if this has ever come up(Ive never seen it) but Jons death is the most important turning point in Jon's character arch and the fate of Westeros. Jon needed to die, he is so fervent on keeping his honor and the Nights Watch oath that his only escape from them would be his death. Now that Jon has died, the vows he had previously taken are meaningless. The oath of the nights watch states ""Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death"". I think we will see Jon return and leave the watch altogether and focus on restoring balance in the rest of Westoros, now that the oath is worthless. He is now going to lead the wildling army that sits on the southside of the wall to Winterfell and reclaim it for the Starks. Also if Rhaegar and Lyanna were truly married then he would not only be next in line to take the throne but now he has the ability to be king without the Night Watch's oath stopping him. His death, though sudden, was necessary for the narrative because it allows for Jons character to remain honorable like Ned, leave the Nights Watch, and take a more active role in the rest of Westeros.

Maybe their honesty loophole is that when he's resurrected, he will be Azor Ahai, and no longer referred to as Jon Snow? I know it's not original to think he's likely Azor Ahai, but perhaps this foretells rather significant changes to his character going forward.

Seems to me that this happens a lot in the books. Catelyn is no longer called Catelyn, but becomes Lady Stone Heart, Gregor is no longer called Gregor, but becomes Ser Robert Strong, etc.

It seems pretty obvious that Harrington is back, and based on comments he's made, will be there until the end. But maybe the game D&amp;D, Gurm, Harrington, and Co. are playing is that Jon Snow really is done! He's almost certain to leave the Night's Watch, and it seems evident he needs to end up in Essos... but could we hear him speak in a different accent? wearing flashier clothes? other major identity changes? no longer answering to Jon Snow?",19,1,False,self,,,,,

First, though, he had worked then tempered it into water. It didn't work. Then, he tempered it by impaling a lion. No luck. Then Nissa Nissa and it worked.

So Jaime's sword, now given to Brienne,

* Was Ice, and melted (symbolizing water) down to become something else (reforged)

* A fur pelt was put on the ""Water"" in the show (symbolizing the Lion's fur), and red dye (the color oif House Lannister - the Lion's blood) which didn't work **EDIT 2:** Or, he kills Cersei, the lioness. Or Tyrion.

Brienne (presumably) kills Stannis, but he's not her loved one. 

Jaime is ""reborn"" and becomes the better man now after bathing with Brienne... in a steaming (smoke) hot bath (salt water).

My tinfoil is this: Jaime gets Oathkeeper back somehow, and kills a lunatic Cersei. This sort of fulfills the Valonqar prophecy (though Jaime can't strangle her with his hand**s**) as well, though we wouldn't get CLEGANEBOWL with the same result of Cersei getting the noose, possibly. **EDIT 2:** Alternatively, Jaime could kill Brienne if he doesn't love Cersei anymore.

**EDIT:** Brienne is a candidate too. She could easily kill Jaime, her loved one (and this fits with LSH in the books). ",7,5,False,self,,,,,

So after the Gold Cloaks tried to find Gendry, one of them says he would come back with more men and take Yoren's head. Which ultimately happens, but why didn't Yoren anticipate this? He simply allows it to happen, even after being warned. He stays on the Kings Road, makes no attempt at hiding the group, and ultimately gets overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies. 

Shouldn't he have done something else? It seems out of character for him to get so caught off guard, did he not believe the Gold Cloak when he said he'd be back with more men? It just seemed like he didn't see them as a threat, which is out of character. Yoren knows he's hiding Arya and Gendry, he should have taken more precautions, get off the King's Road, and hid.

Sansa was about 10 feet away from her, they're even in the same frame for a few moments. From what I understand she was still under oath to bring the Stark children home at that time. So did she just forget? She didn't even look at Sansa's direction. Sansa's marriage to Tyrion was well known at the time, there's no way Brienne would not have seen Sansa there next to Tyrion, the most recognizable person at the front wedding table. She makes no attempt at even planning to rescue Sansa at that time, arguably it would have been easiest to get to Sansa before the wedding, before Joffrey's death.

Jaime makes no attempt at helping Sansa either, as he was also under oath to help the Starks after being freed by Catlyn. So we have both Jaime and Brienne, under oath to return Sansa home and they're doing nothing but standing there. Jaime breaking his oath I can understand, but the sudden shift from Brienne paying respects to Cercei of all people, then going hyper-focused at finding Sansa seems off. In fact, Brienne talks about bringing Jaime back safely right in front of Cercei with Sansa in the background shot. The whole reason Jaime is back in King's landing was due to Brienne's oath. So what exactly was going before the wedding? What was Brienne doing? ",6,8,False,self,,,,,

I have not read the books so the lore that Im basing this on is only what has been portrayed in the HBO series (up to season 5). 

About a decade into the future, several significant battles have taken place, and the population of the seven kingdoms has almost entirely died out. The white walkers have travelled far beyond the wall, and the Nights Watch along with the Free Folk have long been united. They managed to defeat the army of white walkers using an array of obsidian tipped arrows along with additional dragonglass based weaponry  while nearly eradicating themselves in the process. In addition, a civil war-esque conflict has developed within Westeros, as various parties (known or possibly unknown at this point in the series) have come to a head after leagues of tension during the long winter. Kings Landing faced the brunt of the ordeal, and has essentially become a wasteland. Bodies are strewn about, blood coats the streets, and the level of destruction is unparalleled in comparison to what Westeros has faced in the past. There is no rule  only anarchy. 

Nearly every significant character has met his or her end at this point. Trials, battles, accidents, and backstabbing have all played a role, as per usual in the world of Game of Thrones. 

Only two characters remain  Ser Jaime Lanniser, and Hodor. Jaime has been gravely wounded, with mere minutes to live after facing multiple stab wounds in his lower back.
Jaime considers slitting his own throat in order to relieve his misery, and decides that it is his best option. He draws his sword, and just moments before ending his life, Hodor wanders in to the Red Keep. Spotting Jaime bleeding out, he quickly waddles over to assess the situation. 

Jaime  having gone longer than he could remember without sighting a familiar face  bursts into tears. Unable to speak, he gazes upwards at Hodors oddly smug expression. Hodor then kneels in front of him, and looks deep into his eyes. Jaime, now hopeless, says Hodor please Hodor then begins to speak, in an unfamiliarly deep and menacing voice. What he then says brings Jaimes sobbing to an abrupt halt, and causes his face to completely drain of what little color was left.

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled, was convincing the world he didn't exist.

Jaimes eyes widened, as a single tear shot down his cheek. 

Hodor then took his dagger and surged it through Jaimes neck. After using his robe to wipe the blood off the blade, he crept up and claimed his rightful place on the Iron Throne.

Does Varys have king's blood? Why would the lord of light want his junk? 
Also, I take it ""King's blood"" actually means Targ blood, and Gendry's blood was important because of Robert's Targ grandmother? Book readers: does this even happen in the books?

-------------

Often when discussion turns towards the R'hllor, Melisandre, and the worship of the Red God I have noticed many operate under the presumption that R'hllor does indeed exist, the Red Religion is basically correct, and Melisandre is communing with ""him"" in some manner.  Below I will refute this point by point, addressing everything seemingly caused by religious action or divine intervention as nothing more than trickery, confusion, and magic of fire and shadow.  These events primarily arise due to the action of Melisandre herself or that of the Brotherhood Without Banners operating under the religious instruction of Thoros of Myr.  In doing so I will be pulling from the books, but will address differences between them and the show.

--------------

**1) Melisandre's Feats**

1a) *Mel's Shadow Assassin*: this is magic, plain as simple.  In both books and show Mel coats the process and production of the shadow creature in her religion, but that's mere trickery (something she's well versed in, and I'll cover further down).  This is not the action of a Fire Priestess, but that of a Shadowbinder from Asshai.  This manner of magic is mentioned several times throughout the books and show, and Melisandre openly admits and is understood to be one:

&gt;The woman was the heart of it. Not the Lady Selyse, the other one. The red woman, the servants had named her, afraid to speak her name. ""I will speak her name,"" Cressen told his stone hellhound. ""Melisandre. Her."" Melisandre of Asshai, sorceress, shadowbinder, and priestess to R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire..."" ~Cressen, Maester of Dragonstone

Only Melisandre herself claims that the production of the shadow creature was related to Rh'llor and her religion, no one else ever does, despite meeting numerous other figures from the Red Religion and even another shadowbinder (Quaithe).  Furthermore, we know that in Asshai magic is practiced more openly, and that the severe downturn in magical ability experienced throughout the world for the last few centuries effected those in Asshai the least:

&gt;It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn't there be dragons too? ~Dany talking to her handmaidens.

Furthermore, during her dedicated chapter Melisandre even appears to admit to herself that the Shadow Creatures are creations of *sorcery!*

&gt;My spells should suffice. She was stronger at the Wall, stronger even than in Asshai. Her every word and gesture was more potent, and she could do things that she had never done before. Such shadows as I bring forth here will be terrible, and no creature of the dark will stand before them. With such sorceries at her command, she should soon have no more need of the feeble tricks of alchemists and pyromancers. ~Melisandre, reflecting on her position at Castle Black

-------------

2a) *Mel's Visions of the Future*: several times throughout both book and show Melisandre claims to see the future, albeit often in confusing or distorted manners.  And here I do agree, she is indeed seeing something-- but she is just one of many to be granted such power, and there are no indications that R'hllor is actually inducing them.  In the show both Maggy the Frog (as seen in the Season 5 flashback) and the sorcerers of the House of the Undying exhibit similar abilities, presumably because of their magical and thus not divine origination.  Furthermore, in the books the Ghost of High Heart also demonstrates the ability, with her visions in particular sounding exactly like Mel's:

&gt;Snowflakes swirled from a dark sky and ashes rose to meet them, the grey and the white whirling around each other as flaming arrows arced above a wooden wall and dead things shambled silent through the cold, beneath a great grey cliff where fires burned inside a hundred caves. Then the wind rose and the white mist came sweeping in, impossibly cold, and one by one the fires went out. Afterward only the skulls remained. ~Melisandre's vision in the fire

&gt;The old gods stir and will not let me sleep. I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye. I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings. I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, oh, I woke from terror. All this I dreamt, and more. ~The Ghost of High Heart's vision

Both are full of symbolism, both are ultimately true.  Neither is from a god.

--------------

3a) *Mel's Burning of the Leeches*: clearly coincidence.  To suggest that in a war between five rival kings all of them would survive would be ridiculous, and at least in the show her assertions regarding their impending deaths is proven wrong, as Balon Greyjoy outlives Stannis Baratheon.  Nothing occurs to suggest a divine hand is acting against Robb, Stannis, or Renly.

--------------

4a) *Mel's Breaking of the Winter Storm*: thus far this event has only occurred within the show, so there is limited textual information on it.  Again, however, this appears to be nothing more than coincidence-- or at best Melisandre operating with an understanding of weather beyond that of her contemporaries.  This knowledge could have been obtained during her still murky past.  Unfortunately there wasn't a Maester on hand, given Melisandre's dislike of them, so we cannot know if a secular individual could have predicted the same outcome.

--------------

5a) *Mel's Ability to Manipulate Fire*: several times throughout the books and show, Melisandre is shown to be capable of manipulating fire in some limited degree-- either by inducing visions for others, or just making it do odd things (smoke heavily, change color).  The source of this ability was not revealed until a chapter was dedicated to her, and we learn:

&gt;While the boy was gone, Melisandre washed herself and changed her robes. Her sleeves were full of hidden pockets, and she checked them carefully as she did every morning to make certain all her powders were in place. Powders to turn fire green or blue or silver, powders to make a flame roar and hiss and leap up higher than a man is tall, powders to make smoke. A smoke for truth, a smoke for lust, a smoke for fear, and the thick black smoke that could kill a man outright. The red priestess armed herself with a pinch of each of them. ~Melisandre, going over her stock of supplies

We must conclude that she is simply well versed in alchemy, and how best to produce reactions that appear to be of divine origination.

--------------

**2)Thoros' Feats**

2a) *Thoros Raises Beric from the Dead*: this is clearly the most poignant of the supposed feats performed by followers of the Red God.  The show gives a pretty good overview of events when this occurs, but the book goes a bit further with a longer description-- and its there we find the truth.  This is not an act of religion, through which R'hllor acts-- but that of *fire magic*, misunderstood overtime and converted into religion.  Let's look at Thoros' own telling of it:

&gt;""I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time, his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I knew there was no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave him the good god's own kiss to send him on his way. I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him, down his throat to lungs and heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord's servants as they died. I had given it a time or two myself, as all priests must. But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come open. It was not me who raised him, my lady. It was the Lord. R'hllor is not done with him yet. Life is warmth, and warmth is fire, and fire is God's and God's alone."" ~Thoros, speaking to Arya

They speak prayers, take fire into their mouths in some manner, and then breath it into the fallen.  If we conclude this is not divine action, then we must conclude that it is *magic*.  Fire magic, more directly, misinterpreted as a religion.  This would in fact establish the Red Religion as the branch of magic associated with fire, just as there are branches associated with ice (the White Walkers) and water:

&gt;At Volon Therys, Garin found himself facing a hundred thousand foes, a hundred war elephants, and three dragonlords. Here too he prevailed, though at great cost. Thousands burned, but thousands more sheltered in the shallows of the river, whilst their wizards raised enormous waterspouts against the foe's dragons. ~From the History of the Rhoynar's war with Valyria

But why is this ability showing up now, and not in the thousands of presumed ""last kisses"" provided each day across Essos?  Part of it I cannot be sure, there is something Thoros and Beric are doing that's almost unique.  But as to their ability to only do it now, that is because of Dany's dragons, their return having induced a sudden ability boost for pyromancers and workers of fire magic across the world:

&gt;""Half a year gone, that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass. He had some small skill with powders and wildfire, sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work. He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air, but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets.""  

&gt;Dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood. Even the smoke was gone now, and the crowd was breaking up, each man going about his business. In a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty. ""And now?""  

&gt;""And now his powers grow, Khaleesi. And you are the cause of it."" ~Dany and her Handmaidens

To further prove this, we must draw the obvious conclusion: if magic is at the root of both the White Walker's ice powers and the Red Religion's fire powers, would not the raising of the dead inflict a comparatively terrible toll upon the risen, such as the soullessness of the Wights?  Of course, and that is why if you wait to long even fire magic has its limits:

&gt;""She is,"" said Thoros of Myr. ""The Freys slashed her throat from ear to ear. When we found her by the river she was three days dead. Harwin begged me to give her the kiss of life, but it had been too long. I would not do it, so Lord Beric put his lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from him to her. And . . . she rose. May the Lord of Light protect us. She rose.""

----------------------------

**TL;DR--** its fire magic and stupid humans, yo.

* Directed By: Alex Graves
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 21, 2013

Theon Greyjoy is betrayed by the cleaning boy, who returns him to the prison for torture. After a failed escape attempt, Jaime realizes that without his sword hand, he is lost, but Brienne, knowing what he did for her, urges him to not give up hope. Varys tells Tyrion how he became a eunuch, and that he now has in his power the magician who castrated him. Bran, with the aid of Jojen Reed, continues to chase the three-eyed raven. At Craster's keep, the surviving Night's Watch, starving, comes into conflict with their host. Craster and Lord Commander Mormont are slain in the struggle and Sam flees with Gilly and her son. Arya and Gendry are taken to the secret cave of the Brotherhood without Banners where they meet their leader, Beric Dondarrion, who later sentences the Hound to trial by combat with him. Daenerys meets with Kraznys to complete the trade of a dragon for the Unsullied army. She tests the Unsullied, then orders them to kill their former masters, reclaims her dragon and frees the Unsullied, who all decide freely to follow her as her new army.

It would be kinda silly to resurrect him just to end up dying anyway. 

With that said I have some questions that i would like to discuss with you people!

1. Do you think Jon will kill Ramsay given the chance? I feel like it wouldn't make that much sense since Ramsay was so hyped in Season 5 with his 20 man scene and the fight against Stannis... Maybe he (Jon) kills Roose for betraying his ""half-brother/cousin"" and Ramsay gets given a purpose? It wouldn't be THAT bad for Ramsay, without his father he could easily get rid of Sexy Walda if she doesn't get killed in the fighting and make himself the only Bolton heir.

I say about ""being hyped"" because for example, Robb was hyped season 1 and died season 3, Stannis was hyped season 2 and died in the 5th. I don't know if they would kill him just like that 1 season after he starts being a really relevant character to the story. Maybe Ramsay runs away back to the Bolton lands?

2. Who might support Jon in this battle? Davos? Melisandre? Maybe Littlefinger? And his Bannerman who will be?

3. Jon doesn't seem to be interest in being ""King"", in having that type of power, maybe because he never thought about it for being a Snow but do you think this might change if he finds out his true parentage and that he actually has a claim on the throne? Or will this battle be more about giving the North back to the Starks (Sansa? Rickon?) and avenging his family (The North Remembers)

4. This is kinda off-topic but still about Jon. His fighting skills don't seem that awesome to me, at least when watching through the show, although he kicks the ass of everyone in Castle Black he seems to struggle a bit more against people that maybe Jamie, Ser Barristan, Bronn or Jorah wouldn't. Is it just me?

5.  Do you think Bran, Rickon or Arya will be beside Jon when he leads the attack?

My overall opinion of this battle is that in the emotional aspect Jon will lose but in terms of the war itself he will win (Bitter sweet GRRM often talks about?). Sansa might die, maybe Tormund if Jon takes the wildlings? He isn't family but Jon has big respect for him.

Thank you for taking time to read and discuss! Sorry for some gramar errors and Have a nice day!",59,21,False,self,,,,,

I named my fantasy football team ""Game of Throws"" (as I have for the past few years). Usually, I'm terrible at fantasy football, and lose a bunch of games, but this year I've been winning and want to talk smack to my opponents using ASOIAF-themed quotes (or perhaps other relevant references). 

Week 1, I defeated my opponent definitively, and simply posted ""Sorry OpponentsTeamName, when you play the Game of Throws, you win or you die."" I'm looking to do something similar each week to go with the theme. 

My question is this: **What quotes, from the ASOIAF books or the GOT show, would make for good smack talk after defeating an opponent?**  

Obviously smack talk applies beyond just fantasy football too, that's just how I happen to be planning to use whatever quotes this sub can come up with :P


Here's a few I've come up with so far:

&gt; ""When you play the game of thrones you either win or you die, there is no middle ground.""   - *Cersei Lannister*

(I used that one for week 1)

&gt; ""Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.""   - *Jorah Mormont*

(I'm probably replacing ""Rhaegar"" with ""OpponentTeamName"" for week 2.)

&gt; ""If you cant protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can.""   - *Sandor Clegane*

Harsh, but fits the bill. 

&gt; ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.""   - *Ned Stark*

(Reserved for a close game that comes down to Monday night football to determine the winner)

&gt; ""There is only one thing we say to Death...Not today""   - *Syrio Forel*

So Beric says afterwards that the Lord of Light is not yet done with Sandor Clegane, and had him live for this reason. Of course, this might just be religious nonsense, and Beric just lost because the Hound is a better swordsman and generally stronger and more in shape(even while he was on the roads for weeks with this whining and screaming Arya, he had plenty of chickens), but at the same time, it might also mean that R'hllor actually needs the Hound to fulfill some kind of purpose in the bigger scheme, the same way R'hllor also needed Beric to stay alive(thus reviving him through Thoros over and over). The purpose of Beric is not (yet) shown in the show, but it is written in the books: LSH. 

So, personally, I'm a big fan of the well known Cleganebowl theory(if you don't know what I'm talking about, I can explain the comments, though there are some show and book spoilers involved) thus I want to believe the dog lives on. Is it possible that Cleganebowl could be the reason R'hllor wants the hound to live? Is there another reason? Or was Beric just being salty about losing a trial by combat and was he just making excuses? Leave your thoughts, please!

**Euron:** I don't know much about him, i haven't read the books yet but i know he is coming back for the Kingsmoot? And that he says he found a Dragon Egg that he used to trade? Is it official in the books he has the Dragon Horn or any hint that he didn't sell the Egg? What do you think will be his motivation for this Season?

Even without knowing much about him, I personally think he has a gran plan in progress, i don't think he will come back to the Iron Islands just to take the Castle and stay there. Taking the Castle might be the first step in his objective. I've also seen a person commenting about Euron taking both the imprisoned Dany dragons, can this happen?

**Bran:** What role to you think Bran will play this upcoming Season? People believe it will be a very big one, I've seen people think it will be him learning about Jon's true parentage, but even if he did, how could he prove to the citizens of Westeros the truth? 

Do you think he will go back to the North through the Wall? Will he have knowledge that the White Walkers are a true force when we see him again? He is beyond Hardhome and the White Walkers were there already, they must have passed through the Tree Bran was located right?

**Sam:** My opinion is that he will find something really important in The Citadel. Something that will make him go running up North to tell Jon because he won't even trust a raven with it. I personally think he will find out the Horn of Winter might be hidden somewhere like Mance's camp or who knows Craster's home? Or even burried where they first found Dragonglass? 

1) Why i do think it will be about the Horn of Winter? As we know the White Walkers are getting closer and closer to the Wall and maybe its time for this Horn to come into play, even if it only gets mentioned, i don't think there is other logical way for the Wall to fall if not by the Horn's power, i don't see White Walkers beating the Wall till it falls.

2) Why i think he won't stay too long in The Citadel? To become a Maester you need years and years and he won't have that time in the show IMO, also for what i've read, his father doesn't want him to be a Maester so maybe that will help on his decision to go back North.

I don't really have an idea of what these 3 will be doing next season and i would like to hear your opinions. Thank you for taking the time to read and commentate, sorry for some grammar mistakes and have a nice day everyone!",7,5,False,self,,,,,

I've read 75% of book 1, but my question is this: When does the story line really diverge in the TV series away from the books? What amount of books can I skip before missing content pertinent to the books' story arc?

As I say, I don't enjoy reading books, but the story line interests me enough that I might want to give it a bit of a try. Any help is appreciated. :)


**EDIT:** I'll give Book 2 a go. Apparently it is pretty dense so we'll see if I can keep interest! :P

I was very disappointed because I was expecting an epic battle and all that. But then I remembered... The battle may have happened ""off screen"" in the books too. So Jon recives this letter which Ramsay has written. He says he smashed Stannis' host and won the battle. So Jon thinks it's not true, tries to go for Winterfell but gets shanked. So my question is... did Ramsay tell the truth?

SO my theory goes: The Wildlings are all ""aye"" for going on Winterfell and Jon wants to lead them, since Stannis is defeated. So I think in Winds of Winter we will have a resurrected Jon, free of his NW vows since he technically died, leading a Wildling army, together with what's left of the Northern loyalist houses, against the Boltons. This goes very well with the show since in S5, Stannis is defeated already, and on-set reports for the filming of Season 6 claim there is a huge battle sequence beign filmed between the Boltons on one side and various northern houses and Wildlings on the other side. More so, both Kit Haringhton and Iwan Rheon were seen in Belfast for the filming.

Now these are only things that have happened upto the 5th book or 5th Season. More such plot points could of course crop up in subsequent seasons or books.

The basic idea is to list, unexplained events or to list things or places from the book that could have a greater significance than meets the eye, the explanations to which will be key to solving the puzzle to the Game of Thrones Finale.

1) Who sent the assassin to kill Bran when he was injured after being pushed by Jaime Lannister?
This is an almost forgotten plot point. We know that Jaime and Cerci didn't, and we know Tyrion didn't. So then who sent the assassin to kill Bran? 

Now before everyone jumps, and says it was Joffrey, let me say that it wasn't. How on earth would Joffrey, who was in Winterfell at the time, arrange an assassin to go and kill Bran. If it was King's Landing okay Joffrey could have done it, but its unlikely that Joffrey by himself could arrange to kill Bran, by finding a secret assassin all by himself in a place he barely knows and where the people love the family of the target. it doesn't add up. 

Remember the assassin was never identified, which meant he was not from around Winterfell, and even Joffrey would not be mad enough to send a person from his father's troupe to Winterfell , to do the killing for him. If caught alive the Assassin would be a huge embarassment for the king. I think the Joffrey angle is there for people to think that the plot point has been explained and there is nothing more to it. Joffrey however just doesn't add up as the true mastermind behind the assassination attempt. The reason even less so. That Joffrey wanted to kill Bran because King Robert said that killing the child would be mercy. I mean what? Joffrey knows that his father and Ned are good friends and if he actually killed one of Ned's sons, howsoever crippled, Robert would upset as hell, and not at all impressed.

All we know is the Littlefinger lied about the dagger to Catelyn leading to her capturing Tyrion. However, that is all we know. That littlefinger lied could mean he knows who is behind it all, but it is about all we know.
So then who? I think the answer to this question will reveal the ultimate hidden hand that has secretly been moving all the pieces unknown to all, except perhaps Littlefinger.

2) Where on earth is Benjen Stark?

The obvious explanation is that he was perhaps capture by the White Walkers and is either dead or has become a White Walker himself.

However I suspect the solution to his disappearance is not really that simple. There is a reason why Benjen Stark had to disappear for the purpose of the story. Is it because he knows R+L=J? Is this why the Author had to find a way to keep him away from the scene. 

Apart from such 'logistical' reasons, let us remember that very little is known of the White Walkers. Benjen has disappeared north of the wall, where all the 'funky' stuff is. The Children of the Forest, the White Walkers, etc. All of those are covered in a lot of mystery. I have a feeling Benjen's reappearance will also bring along with it the solution to one of the mysteries north of the wall, and the revealing will be something extraordinary that 'changes everything'.

3) Just what is the Wall?

The simple story as it goes is that Brandon, a builder, to protect the realms of men from Wildlings, and is said to also have spells of magic and sorcery further strengthening it. I suspect the true story of the Wall is yet to be revealed, and much more is going to come to light. I suspect that at some point the Wall is going to fall, and by fall I mean literally crumble to the ground. What will come to light once that happens, what all secrets is the wall hiding. Ice-Dragons anyone?

4) Jon Snow's 'Real' Family Tree

Enough has been said already.

5) Dani's Path to become the villain?

I think GoT started out with the Lannisters as the villains of the story. Tywin however is dead, Jaime definitely one of the good guys now, and Cersi hardly in a position to call the shots. So that leaves the series villainless. I am not forgetting the White Walkers, and nor do I forget the Boltons. The point is that the White Walkers remain the big evil, and the Boltons are smallish villains to say the least, and don't compare to the threat the Lannisters once were.

The GoT world doesn't have absolute heroes and villains and Jaime Lannister is the perfect example. The same person doing the same acts is the villain from one perspective and a hero from another.

I have a feeling that the present void for the villain will be filled by Dani. Her path will ultimately lead to her becoming the villain in the story. I think her path will be key to things unfolding from here on.

6) Hodor !!
Okay I am probably far over-reaching here, but is it possible that the word (not the person) mean something? Why say Hodor again and again and again. What is the story of the person. Is Hodor a word that is key to something boldly hidden in plain sight. Why does Hodor just keep repeating Hodor again and again, and not any other word. Does Hodor mean 'something important' is a clue to something important.

7) Gendry

Okay we know Gendry is the son of King Robert and he keeps showing up in important places, keeps getting into trouble to get away later. We know he has the king's blood in him, and we all know that in the magic of Westeros, that has a key role to play. I suspect Gendry has a vital role to play in all of this yet.

I have been rewatching, and I came up with a theory regarding Jaime's golden hand.

He says to Cersei 'a hook would've been more practical,' though she simply says that the hand is more elegant.

In my opinion all things in this show have importance, it would've made sense to give Jaime a hook, as it would be more useful, however, it is Qyburn who gives Jaime this hand, and Qyburn is known for his mysterious magic and experiments. After all he is the one who presents the reanimated Gregor Clegane to Cersei.

My theory is that at some point we will see Jaime's hand reanimate, and we will see him at full strength fighting with his natural side with his golden hand, with the sword that was given to Joffrey, 'widow's wail'

It is also my guess (as it is many others) that Jaime kills Cersei, and the sword's name furthers my theory, as Cersei is a widow, and she will wail as she dies. (Sure this may be clutching at straws, but Chekhov's gun etc..)

Supposedly Jon Snow is dead.

'Snow' is the surname given to bastards from the North.

R + L = J theory says he's not a bastard from the North.  He'd be a bastard of Dorne based on where R + L were.  If that's the case, his name would properly be Jon Stone (I believe, or something similar).

So if Melisandre saves Jon either before or after he dies, and then tells him his true lineage, then Jon Snow would cease to exist... one could consider Jon Snow dead, at least from a certain point of view.

In that way, everyone in the production crew and the actors who have said Jon Snow is dead would be correct.  In his place is the new Jon, who knows his lineage, and is somehow made healthy again, and is doing the scenes making the rounds today.

He says ""what do we say to the god of death, not today"" as his last significant line (which would be pretty stupid if he died directly afterwards, and he's not a stupid character), and we hear a metal sword clink on the ground, George wrote this episode and I don't think either of those details would be insignificant. Furthermore as I'm sure other people have mentioned in related threads it feels a bit off to have such an inconclusive end to a character.

Kit Harrington was seen in the sets in Stark clothes, it can't be a flashback because he has Longclaw with him which means he will leave The Wall and head up North. 

I have some questions and i would like to hear your opinions!:

1. How will Jon be legitimized a Stark? Will he ""force"" the idea of being a Stark on the people? Doesn't seem like a Jon-ish decision... I don't know if people welcome him as a true Stark in the North, i think we never get to know that on the show... 

2. What should he be doing first? Gather houses to aid him?

**My opinion:** I want to hope Stannis left a decree in Castle Black. He could only benefit from it, even if he succeeded vs the Boltons and took the North, he still would need someone to guard it when he decided to march to the South and if Jon ever accepted it, it could be exactly him. They absolutely murdered his character in season 5 and it would be a good way to mention Stannis in season 6. Since the decree would be written by a man that had Ned's support, the people in the North would probably take that into consideration. It would also give the Starks another contender to free the people in the North, since every single male Stark is probably assumed dead. 

If word spreads that a new KINGINDANORF has arrived and that he has the support of the whole North, Roose might just be forced to leave the North because a fight would be catastrophic for him as he doesn't have help from the South, since Tywin died.

 

Sorry for some grammar mistakes, looking forward to hear your opinions, have a nice day!

Bran Stark*

*""That is the only time a man can be brave.""  Eddard Stark*

This is a short extract from the first book. I'm actually not sure if this made it into the show (edit: thanks Kb736 and msstark, turns out it did!), but it's for this reason that I believe Theon Greyjoy is an incredibly strong character - and why you might consider starting to respect him if you don't already. He was tortured and terrified to the point of almost total insanity, but he still managed to fight his way back at the end of season 5. That, I believe, indicates a great deal of courage and willpower.

I'm not saying this totally absolves him of his sins or anything like that, but I feel like there's a relative lack of interest in the character around here (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), so I figured I'd just do him a little advocating! 

You'd be right to say he hasn't accomplished as much good in the world as Jon Snow, as Brienne of Tarth or even Jaime fookin' Lannister; but as a *singular feat*, I personally consider his most recent action to be the greatest demonstration of *strength* in the story so far.",16,20,False,self,,,,,

It just seems to be a poor play on his part leaving so many of his best fighters so vulnerable at the end of the world... Are the books more specific? ,17,14,False,self,,,,,

I believe Littlefinger gave Catelyn Ned's outfit that he was hearing upon his death.  The chest that Littlefinger presents Catelyn with is too small for his body, but too large for ashes. It seems like the perfect size to put the Ned's outfit in though. Whether this made it to Winterfell in the show is yet to be seen, but it would make the most sense for Jon wearing identical clothing to his supposed Father.  Let me know what you guys think.

(Transcript from video)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K46EyfjNkP8

#5
D&amp;D have said that they don't like flashbacks, they gave in last season yes, with only one flashback that was absolutely needed for show watchers to fully understand Cersei's motives, it was a crucial part of the story, that's why they had to do it.
There's already 2 confirmed flashbacks for this season which have nothing to do with a grown up Jon like we see in this picture, theres the confirmed flashback when Ned is a little kid sparring with a sibling and theres the confirmed flashback of the tower of joy, I could be wrong but I highly doubt there would be another flashback if they didn't like doing them in the first place, feels like it would be too much, and I don't see a real need for it.

#4
Now this one I had to spend some extra time on. If you look closely you can see he's got a sword on him that may or may not be Longclaw, how to tell? well at first I thought the sword ended here which would've made it a bit too short to be longclaw, and then I started thinking hmm how long is Longclaw in the show and has Jon carried Longclaw before? was it this way, or was i t on his back? I was finally able to find the scenes where I remember him carrying Longclaw and this is how he carries it, on his hip and under his arm. After I found this I knew where to look for the hilt, so I went back to the picture and.. well well well, what is this little thing here, looks like part of a sword hilt to me, under his arm! and curved downward like Longclaw's. If this is Longclaw, this is definitely NOT a flashback, we all know that Jon only got this awesome Valyrian sword after joining the Night's Watch from Jeor Mormont.

#3
The only people on set that get to have umbrellas held up for them are actors and actresses, so we can safely assume that this lady is an actress, you could argue the umbrella is there to cover the equipment but as you can see all equipment already has plastic covers on, now if you zoom in really close, you can see a very particular set of cheekbones that not a lot of people have and that forehead too, ehem ehehm... yes, many people believe this is Carice Van Houten the red witch Melisandre under the umbrella... if it is her, then that is definitely not a flashback! There's also the fact that this lady is wearing blue and not red, but it's clearly cold where they are and this is definitely the picture of a break in-between shots, her outfit is very revealing even in the North because the fire of the lord of light is inside Melisandre unfortunately not inside of Carice so in-between shots she needs to cover up! But also Carice had just posted two Instagram pictures in LA, it's a bit of a stretch for her to have traveled so quickly but it's not impossible, I also haven't been able to find proof of when this picture was taken, only when it was published (if anyone has proof please leave it in the comments) but come on! it looks so much like her!!

#2
It has been confirmed that they've spent a couple weeks already filming a huge battle scene that will happen in the north, they spread all that fake snow in saintfield for it, and you can see fake snow in this picture as well which sorta proves they're still filming the same thing, also there's been sightings of Kit Harington being part of this battle scene as well but not only that!! It's been confirmed that this battle scene is part of episode 9 of season 6 which will be directed by Miguel Sapochnik (the guy who directed the best season 5 episodes episode 7 ""The Gift"" and episode 8 ""Hardhome"") and the guy that Kit is talking to in this picture is Miguel Sapochnik Get what I meannn, Miguel Sapochnik is filming a battle scene not a flashback? alright moving on to reason

#1
(I could be wrong but) I don't think Jon ever wore these Stark clothes before, we saw the Starks as kids in season 1 and none of them wore this back then except for Ned when he goes to Kings Landing these are not just regular Winterfell clothes, this is Stark battle armor, proof is the fact that Robb only started wearing this after he goes to war against the Lannisters. If this were a flashback, it would mean that Jon at some point fought for the Starks, and we know for a fact that this is not true, he was a kid and he went from his kid's clothes to wearing the black cloaks of the Night's Watch. There was no real need for him to wear this armor when he lived peacefully in Winterfell, and also no real need to show this in a flashback.


So I'm not gonna tell you to take my word for all of this. I could be biased but I personally highly doubt this is a flashback and I am extremly excited to see this picture.

I want to hear YOUR opinions and theories!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3mpnl3/all_spoilers_what_is_the_relation_between/,UnaBombaH,1443455497,"**I'm only looking to provoke discussion/theorycrafting and maybe learn something of the lore myself, so if you came in looking for good OC from me, I'm sorry to disappoint.**

I have been lurking this subreddit ever since I found the books/TV adaptation, but haven't gotten to posting anything yet. Now I wanted to try and provoke discussion since people here have previously been open to theories and are good at providing contradicting/approving evidence. So onto my ""showerthought""/follow up question:

 * Showerthought: **All other ""gods"" in the series are being awfully quiet compared to the Lord of Light.** Now I know The Big G(eorge) himself has said something along the lines of ""there are no true gods visible in the series"". But hasn't he also said that there really *IS* supernatural magic in the series? Meaning the deeds done in the name of Rhollor are actually some sort of (blood) magic?

 * Follow up question: **What kind of powers can/could/should be awakened through the power of the Seven or The Old Gods?** Now, I am willing to connect The Old Gods to warging and green dreams (I think it can be agreed upon?), but what powers come through the faith of The Seven? Or to rephrase it: what form of magic can be used alongside the faith of The Seven? When looking at everything magical in ASOIAF, it seems to come from any other religion than The Seven. The way I see it, ""The Seven"" give more political power in the form of social status and military alliances, and is the faith of the ""civilized"". That's why I also see a connection here to ""science"" more than to magic. But it also gives birth to another question in my mind: Are their believers dumber and ""weaker"" for believing Septons who are actually common men without any god given powers? Unless the High Sparrow is the first true High Septon (of the Faith), and thus has powers we haven't seen yet..? Maybe that is too hopeful and stretching it.

 * Let's take another route: Is Lazor Ahoy vs White Walkers -prophecy the gist of it all? The name of the series suggests as much. If so, wouldn't that make Lord of Light the ""main god"", the one actual faith, that has an effect for the outcome of the lives of everyone? This, to me, seems to devalue other religions in Westeros. And if we disregard the religious aspect: the ability to heal and even resurrect others seems rather ""overpowered"" compared to spying others through trees.. (intentionally being mean to Bran)

________________________________________________________________________________

So, what do you think: Can religion be completely separated from magic in ASOIAF? What form of magic is the strongest and why? Does the faith of The Seven have some hidden powers in the form of magic, or do their believers only get political power from each other? And finally: **do you think Jorge R.R. Martell has The Lord of Light picked as the one true God in ASOIAF?**",8,8,False,self,,,,,

I would rather not find out if it was a spoiler, but i doubt it is.


So basically, Renly and Stannis are fighting for the throne, but Robb would rather just be the king in the north and has no desire for the throne.

So what exactly is he fighting the war with the Lannisters for? He could just trade Jaime Lannister for his two sisters but he somehow stops his mom from doing so. 

In the scene where Arya Stark is being a cupbearer for Tywin Lannister, he states that Robb is trying to march on casterly rock, what use does he have for casterly rock? And somehow Tywin was able to go to King's Landing to defend the city from Stannis while he was fighting the war which is kinda surprising.

Hope this isn't a stupid post, am genuinely confused. If the answers to my questions are spoilers in any way, I would rather not be told and have somebody notify me to watch on.

Maybe this theory is already out there, maybe not.  TBH, I did a little research, but did not search the infinite mass of Reddit to find out.  

What if the producers have KH under contract, and are still paying him, to set up the viewers into thinking/believing Jon Snow will return to the show (and likely the books as well)?  I have not read the last 3 books, so maybe there is more information in there to point toward Jon Snows fate.  What if its all calculated and cunning by HBO and the producers and we are being played? What if everything that has happened in the last 6 months is one giant ruse to bait (and switch) everyone into thinking Jon Snow is alive-ish?  After the season ended, HBO started with the ""He's really dead! We had a sit down meeting with KH!"" narrative, knowing nobody would buy it.  They tried to sell the ""Kit cut his long locks!"" story even though again, nobody would believe it, further entrenching die hard fans into believing he would be back.  Then, KH steps out at Wimbledon, sporting the same hair as the (currently) ill fated Jon Snow, and the peasants rejoice (myself included).  They keep the ""casting"" secret, knowing that the more the producers try and hide it, the more people believe he will be back.  Then filming begins...HBO knows every single paparazzi will be taking photos of the set and as soon as ANY KH photo hits the web, everyone WANTS to believe in their heart of stone-hearts he will be back.  What if the KH interview with the Dutch magazine saying he will be (paraphrasing) under contract until he was 30 was all planned and done purposely ahead of filming?  Coincidence that interview came out JUST as filming was starting again?  Im not saying any of this is remotely true, but if it was, would it be the most diabolical ploy in the history of TV/movies? 

I'm sure there are plenty of ways to disprove this theory, up to and including a full fledged RIOT on HBO studios for 'ruining the lives' of many viewers by making them believe Jon Snow would be back, but it was fun to think about for a bit.   ",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Long version:
Mirri Maz Duur did everything in her power to help Khal Drogo, she told him not to remove the bandage and not to drink alcohol. He removed the bandage, filled his wound with mud and drank alcohol. The fault for his condition during the birth of Rhaego was his own fault, not that of Mirri Maz Duur.

Neither Daenerys nor Jorah ever saw the child. Dany was blacked out and when she asked Jorah, he tried to tell her with the words: ""the women said...""
Neither of them ever SAW the ""monster"" that was born or any of his remains.

Ok ok... even IF he just was abducted... so what ?

The birth of a male child - a prince. CHECK
The prince is of the blood of the dragon. CHECK
Born amidst smoke. When Dany wakes, she looks at the ash particles that fly through the air, CHECK
Born amidst salt. He was born in the Dothraki ""Sea"", during his birth dany had a dream and cried and she awoke extremely sweety... CHECK
A bleeding star in the skies. (also mentioned is being born beneath a bleeding star) DOUBLE CHECK
Possibly the return of dragons. TRIPLE CHECK (3 dragons ^^)

He checks all the boxes for the prince that was promised, more so than any other character, for his birth was literal.
Azor Ahai and the prince that was promised, 2 different prophecies. Azor Ahai is the Warrior, the prince that was promised is the sacrifice.
We ""know"" that Azor Ahai killed his wife to defeat the Whites, what if, Daenerys is Azor Ahai born again and, to defeat the whites, will in the last book be reunited with her 2-3 year old son, just to have to kill him.

Soo.... what do you think ?

The shows gunna go further than the books eventually so I don't mind.""
Finished Feast today! Starting Dance tonight (can't wait for more Dany)! I had a few questions since I only watched the show a few months ago...
Why did they add Ramsay Snow? It works, and works really well...but I wonder if they ever commented on it. In fact, the entire Theon storyline. He's pretty much dead by ""Swords #3"" but we also don't see him die. I thought this was a very creative decision by the show's writers (Theon's dead...but now he's Reek).
How much farther than the books has the show gone (remember I don't have any Dance knowledge), I would assume it's Stannis dying, Jon dying, and Cersei's walk, and Sansa making it Winterfell. Maybe Marcyella dying?
Why did they change Jamie's character arc for Season 5? I don't really mind that he want to Dorne (I didn't really care for the Dorne chapters in Feast because they were kinda too random for me) and it brought in those ideas from the book, but why did they not make him go through the character shifts that they normally make sure to touch upon no matter where they put their characters?
Is Season 6 Winds of Winter? Sam's story from Feast? Is there more they haven't touched on Dance with Dragons (that there for I can actually be shocked when I read so no spoilers!) Will Jamie go to the Riverlands in Season 6?

Dont think this is a pure tinfoil theory my friends, this one is a bit of a doosey.
I have reason to believe that Brienne would be one of the few perfect characters in the story to give it more depth, if they were the prophesized Azor Ahai. With my second favorite pick being Samwell Tarly.
But we wont be talking about Sam today, no we are talking about Brienne. This beautiful man of a woman could very well be the realms unexpected savior. But you may be thinking This doesnt sound like it fits at ALL! Well, let me show you what information I gathered in my 6 hour long car ride to Vegas as I kept foaming at the mouth over how excited I was to share this theory when I returned home.
Lets start with born amidst salt and smoke: Many people dont take it as the literal birth sense but possible rebirth through a new life, a new chapter in that persons story, similar to say Jon joining the Nights Watch or Danys rebirth in the pyre.
Where we see Briennes new life begin is when she is protecting her beloved king Renly Baratheon. When a Smokey figure appears and murders him in his tent beside the salty sea. She shortly after swears her Oath to Catelyn, with her new life beginning. Sounds pretty fitting.
How about the bleeding star, this entire event happens early in season two, the bleeding star that appears could of still been in the sky at the time of Renlys death.
Dragons do follow before this happens to Brienne; however this part in the theory is when it begins to get slightly shaky. But it is not that much time after the dragons are born into the world.
Here is when it starts to get a bin tinfoil. Oathkeeper, could be Lightbringer. As we know Valyrian Steel can strike down White Walkers. It isnt ever said that Azor Ahai HAS to make a sacrifice, but a good possibility of the sacrifice to create Lightbringer is for Brienne to kill Jaime Lannister, as it is shown that she does have a love for him, and this would be the same circumstance that Azor Ahai did to create his blade as well. 
The only part of this theory that doesnt fit, is Brienne having the blood of the dragon. Here is where we put on our tinfoil hats.
Oathkeeper was re-forged from the Stark greatsword Ice, and it is said Ice use to be used in battles. Is it possible that Ice spilt Targaryen blood in Roberts Rebellion? Or perhaps before that? Is it possible that Oathkeeper holds Targaryen blood through Ice, the blood of the dragon?

Is Brienne of Tarth Azor Ahai? Please, let me know what you guys think and if you know where any loose ends could be tied. And from a writing perspective, this would be a fantastic twist in the story in my opinion.


EDIT: Here is some info about the blood of the dragon, that Brienne is almost certainly Targeryan!

""

    The Stormlands section of the World Book mentions that the Tarths have family ties to the Durrandons, the Baratheons and, more recently, the Targaryens, but does not elaborate.

    We know based on what Maester Aemon says in Feast that his sisters, Daella and Rhae had children, but suspiciously, both their marriages and their offspring are absent from the Targaryen family tree and the World Book entirely.

    We are also safe in assuming, due to various clues and the fact that it makes perfect sense thematically, that Brienne is likely a descendant of Dunk

What to do with all of this? Well, I think, as others do, that Dunk met, fell in love with and knocked up one of Eggs sisters and that she was married off to a lord of Tarth without him knowing she was already pregnant. While this would leave the fact that the current Tarths are descended from Dunk a mystery, the fact that Brienne's grandmother or whatever was a Targaryen princess would be common knowledge among the nobility in Westeros. So yeah, Brienne is almost certainly part Targaryen."" -blackofhairandheart from /r/asoiaf",17,3,False,self,,,,,

The point of this thread is to discuss/HYPE the new season using those theories.

1.Horn of Winter / Horn of Joramun

2.Dragon Binder (Dragon Horn)

3.Euron's Dragon Egg?

4.CLEGANEBOWL

5.SNOWBOWL

6.Valonqar

7.Azor Ahai

8.Ice Dragon

9.Lady Stoneheart

10.Benjen Stark       

*11. L+R=J


**My opinion**

**1/(10)** : I think the Horn of Winter will be mentioned in season 6, i think Sam will find about it when studying in The Citadel and tell Jon. At the end of Season 6 we might see a shot of it, just a White Walker holding it in front of the Wall [(like this!)](http://imgur.com/ZtkiyR7) and i think that White Walker could be Benjen Stark. It was a Stark who started building the Wall right? Maybe they will need a Stark to use the Horn in order for it to work? I don't know, i think it would be awesome for Jon to see his uncle turned into a White Walker and it would make the community go nuts. Imagine the Hype, Benjen Stark holding the Horn and the last episode ends... The cliffhanger of all cliffhangers...

**5** : Its safe to assume this is going to happen from what we have seen in the sets lately.

**2** : We don't know if the show will go that way (i think), but i believe its time for us to see Dany's dragons being threatened. Maybe Euron tries to take them somehow by using the Dragonbinder.

**3**  (More of a question) : Is it possible Euron has the Egg? I've read 2 theories, Euron's, where he tells he threw the Egg in the water, and a fan theory saying he used the Egg to pay a man to get rid of a certain person.

**6(7)** : I think we will see the Valonqar in the end of season 6 when Cersei loses Tommen. I won't say it will be Jamie killing her because it seems too obvious. I just think it will happen. I placed the Azor Ahai number there because if it is Jamie, we might have a surprise. Imagine he strangles Cersei and his sword goes all fiery, would be an awesome cliffhanger too, although everyone would have noticed what happened.

**11** : I think we will find this out through Brann. I'm just not sure about Jon finding it.

But if you must know....

Jon Snow wakes up from a dream. A dream from Inside ghost. A dream of pure ice and cold. He wakes to The Red Lady standing over him. She said the words. The same words that Thoros told to Beric so many times. Jon Snow is alive. The Prince who was Promised?

Stannis is alive. Midway through her swing, Brieanne changed her mind. She is no executioner, and Stannis is a man of duty. She will let him live, but he must take the black. He agrees to this. His wife is dead. His heir is dead. His army is dead. The only thing left is his claim. He takes the black. He gives up all claims and titles. He and Edd serve justice to the traitors who killed Jon. Thorne, Olly and the rest lose their heads. 

Before saying his oath, Stannis' last act as the rightful king of Westeros is to make Jon Snow into Jon Stark. Stannis takes the black and is immediately voted Lord Commander. Jon has technically fulfilled his  Nights Watch oath. He is now a true born Stark and will lead the wildlings to Winterfell to fight the Boltons and take it back for the Starks. He will save Sansa.

Arya earns her way into the Faceless Men. She gets a contract and looks up to Jaqen/Sexy Jesus/Faceless Man and says ""This is in Westeros. This man is on my list!""

Cersei will face trial for incest and regicide. Many people will testify against her, the most damning evidence coming from Grand Maester Pycele. For the regicide of King Robert, and much like her brother Tyrion, she will choose trial by combat. FrankenGregor is her champion. The Faith Militant's champion is Sandor Clegene. They found him injured on the side of a mountain. They mended his wounds, both physically and spiritually. The seven pointed star carved into his forehead. 

Here comes CLEGENEBOWL!! GETHYPE!! 

The Clegene brothers have an epic battle.!! GETHYPE!! They cut and slash each other! They crush and brutalize each other. Sandor gets the upper hand, but then suddenly FrankenGregor kills Sandor. Oh no!! Cersei is saved. 

Cersei is found innocent by the gods of killing King Robert, but it is undeniably established that her children are the bastards of Jaime. Tommen has no claim and is stripped of his crown, and The Lannisters are banished to Casterly Rock. 

Many days after fighting his brother, FrankenGregor dies. Not from his wounds, but from poison! But that's not Sandors style. Sandor wouldn't have poisoned his blade. But Arya poisoned the blade. FrankenGregor was her contract, paid for by the Martells. Arya killed The Mountain.

The Tyrell's will receive mercy from The Faith Militant. Unlike Cersei, they are very charitable and help the poor. 

Littlefinger will use The Tyrell's as a proxy to introduce the card he's had up his sleeve for some time....Gendry. Gendry is the last remaining heir to Robert Baratheon. He will be re-named Gendry of House Baratheon in the light of the seven. The Faith Millitant will make the lowborn bastard King. The King from Flea Bottom. The Father, The Mother, The Maiden, The Crone, The Warrior, The Stranger, and THE SMITH. Smiths often temper their metals with salt water. Born amongst salt and smoke. The Prince who was Promised?

There will be a great battle at Winterfell. Jon will rally the north men who are loyal to the Starks and join them with the Wildlings. The Boltons and The Freys will combine forces. Littlefinger will send the Knights of the Vale. The Iron Islands will invade. A great battle will take place. Tens of thousands will die. More soldiers for the army of the dead.  

Jon was not brought back to life by Melisandre. He was brought back to life by The Nights King. Jon(and Sam) interfered with Crasters sacrifice.  They took his baby below the wall. The Wildlings were never allowed to cross beneath the wall. There was a truce thousands of years ago between The Others, The Children of the Forest, and Bran the Builder. Jon broke the truce that said that The Nights Watch must keep the Wildlings north of the wall. They belong to the Others for their army of the dead. The wall was built to protect the Others from the realms of man. Jon is not The Prince who was promised by the Red Priestess. He is an Other now, much like the story of The Nights King who was a Stark and a Crow before becoming an Other. Jon has Stark blood. Not Ned's, but Lyannas. He has the blood of Bran The Builder, who made the truce with The Others. 

Melisandre will use blood magic and bring down the wall. The real war begins.

I have seen into the flame..

I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
