The war and its military development has always been the hardest part for me to understand, show or book, but I want to know for the show since I've read its a little different:

What was the progression of Robb's army in season 3? At the end of season 2, he's... I really don't know, somewhere in the Westerlands, I think? But in season 3, once Tywin is back in KL, I really don't know who Robb is fighting against or what he's doing. The two points I know are that he goes to Riverrun for his grandfather's funeral (a distraction, according to Karrstark) and later to the Twins for Edmure's wedding. That's where his army ends, but until that point, could someone explain what the Northern army was up to?",3,8,False,self,,,,,

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

I don't quite understand why Robert and the Council go ballistic upon hearing that Daenerys is pregnant.  They seem to suggest that they have to assassinate her child, who would have a claim to the throne.  My question is, couldn't the same be said of her douchey brother, Viserys, so why didn't they plot his assassination ages ago?

In S1, Benjen Stark said to Jon Snow that something like, ""A man gets what he earns"" before going north. Sam Tarly comes, joins, and is treated like shit who used to be a lord/highborn. Why does Janos Slynt, the former commander of the citywatch, get to be a part of the ""counsel?"" The counsel being the group that is questioning and determining the fate of Jon Snow when he gets back to Castle Black, informing them of the imminent wildling attack from both sides in S4. Slynt is shown in a leadershipesque position. Can anyone explain to me why? If Sam, a former lord, has to work his way up, why dosen't Slynt? Is it because Slynt was knighted and is a Ser?

Heres a (lengthy) recap of what Ive found. I theory tagged this, since some of what's in TWOIAF kind of pertains to some of the more popular fan theories out there. TL;DR at the end for the lazy. 

**Dragonlords are Rare and (usually) Valyrian:** If Quentyn Martell wasnt enough evidence enough for you, TWOIAF makes it pretty clear that being able to master and ride a dragon is not something any commoner with a whelp can do. In the histories of the Targaryen kings it becomes pretty clear that being a Dragonlord depends as much on an innate trait than anything else, a trait that some of the Targaryens didnt even have. Finding effective riders for Viserion and Rheagal will be a challenge for Daenerys unless she manages to find two other worthy riders with Targaryen or Valyrian blood (Jon? Aegon? Tyrion? Etc.)

**Daenerys Will (Probably) Not Be Welcomed:** Varys, Illirio, Barristan and Ser Friendzone can talk this up all they want, but the thought that a Targaryen invader will be welcomed with open arms is a naive one at best. Cersei may be nuts, but shes got nothing on Meagor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, The Mad King and a few of the other (relatively) less insane Targaryen kings. One of them drank wildfire to turn into a dragon. Another one burned most of his family alive to produce a dragon (which is why there arent many Targaryens left by the start of Roberts Rebellion). Point is, Westeros will not flock to a Targaryen banner. The Dornishmen will support her, but any lord who knows his history will be very wary of a Targaryen Queen. Fortunately for Dany, the Dornish support alone may be enough because 

**Fully Grown Drogon, Rhaegal &amp; Viserion Will Win a War:** Its alluded to in ASOIAF, but TWOIAF does a good job of spelling out just how much Aegon relied on Balerion, Meraxes and Vhagar. He landed at the hills that would become Kings Landing with almost no support. What little support he did have was usually divided among several fronts, since he was surrounded from the start by seven different kingdoms. He and his sisters fought every battle badly outnumbered and basically used their dragon(s) as the ultimate trump card. A fully grown dragon is freaking HUGE, almost impossible to kill once its airborne and obliterates armies, garrisons, castles and anything else that can melt.

**The Golden Company Loves a Westeros Rebellion:** The Golden Company (hired by Connington and Aegon in ADWD) is no stranger to trying to unseat people on the Iron Throne. They supported good four or five Blackfyre claims. The most recent of these took place during the Mad Kings fathers reign. The Blackfyers, for those not in the know, were a line of bastard half-Targaryens (and their descendants) who were legitimized by Aegon the Unworthy on his deathbed as a final Fuck You to Westeros. Theyre all dead now because...

**Ser Barristan Is a Badass:** The ASOIAF books talk about him being named Barristan the Bold and how his sacking would hurt Joffreys reputation in the long-run. What they dont delve into is WHY he was so respected. He singlehandedly took down a Blackfyre pretender who was more or less The Mountain of his time and effectively ended a war in the process. When Aerys II was kidnapped, Barristan volunteered to sneak into a besieged city alone and rescue him. He did just that by scaling the walls barehanded, killing the Master at Arms and then cuting his way through a dozen knights to get the King out. Then he fought so bravely and badass-ly during Roberts Rebellion that Robert refused to let him die, set his own maester to look after him and then gave Barristan command of his Kingsguard. 

**Joanna Lannister &amp; The Mad King May Have Actually Been a Thing:** The theory that Tyrion is actually half-Targaryen because of a tryst between the Mad King and Tywins wife Joanna was one that Ive sort of dismissed as being far-fetched. AWOIAF has me thinking, though. It makes it pretty clear that there really may have been something between the two. One thing you need to understand is that Aerys II was actually a pretty cool and chill king at the start of his reign and was also very popular with the ladies. None of his affairs lasted long, but they were extremely numerous and well documented. He was close to Joanna and even lamented openly when Tywin took her as a wife. Aeryss wife produced three healthy children (Rheagar, Viserys and Dany) but in between Rheagar and Viserys there were a lot of miscarriages, stillborns, etc. It was during that time that Joanna Tywin produced Tyrion after having given birth to perfectly healthy twins by Tywin. Im bumping the Tyrion Targaryen theory up from No way to Maybe. Not on the level of R+L=J but getting there. 

TL;DR - Dany may have issues finding dragon riders for Rhaegar and Viserion. Theyll probably have to be of Valyrian descent. Her invasion will not be welcome, because some of the Targaryen kings make Cersei look sweet and innocent by comparison. Thats fine, though, because fully grown dragons will win her a war. As will Ser Barristan (whos a total badass) and Tyrion (who may actually be half-Targaryen). 

That's my take on things. I'm curious to see what else the other readers have dug up. ",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Here's my problem,Sam is a well read,you can say smart guy and how hasn't realised that (again is it Dragonglass) is the one thing that can kill white walkers.All the fuckin clues are there I mean:

1-Find mystery tools made out of rare materials

2-Stabbed a white walker with a normal steel sword

3-Stab with that weird material that you found earlier on and the Walker inmediatly(IIRC my memory is a little foggy) shreds into little pieces and desintegrates.

FUCK,At some point he must had realized that there is something special about that weapon

I've picked out 10 characters and ranked them by who is best singles combat. Would love peoples rankings compared to mine. 

* Ned Stark (presumably at his prime during Roberts Rebellion)
* Robert Baratheon (presumably at his prime during his Rebellion)
* Barristan Selmy (obviously would be #1 in his prime, so ASoS Selmy)
* Jamie Lannister (During AGoT)
* Bronn (AGoT)
* Syrio Forel (Pre AGoT)
* Brienne of Tarth (AFFC)
* Sandor Clegane (AGoT)
* Gregor Clegane (AGoT)
* Oberyn Martell (ASoS)

So the obvious issue would be saying X beats Y, Y beats Z, and Z beats X. So who would win the most amounts is how I would rank them (like I've said, I have thought about this too much)

* Jamie Lannister
* Syrio Forel
* Oberyn Martell

So I've bought all of the collector's editions of the GoT Blu-ray sets from Best Buy, and each one features a slipcover from one of the major houses of Westeros. I'm hoping to get one unique one for every season of the show (and I'm hoping the show goes on for 8 or 9 seasons so I can get every major house). 


But here's my problem: HBO releases only a few different options for each season, and they also tend to re-release slipcovers of the most popular houses. I basically want to ensure that I can get a unique one every year. 


Here's my question: Season 4 is coming out in February, and the slipcovers they're offering are Stark, Lannister, Targaryen, Martell, and Tyrell. I already have the first 3 for Seasons 1-3, so I'm debating between Martell and Tyrell. But I want to make sure that the one I don't get will be one that is rereleased later. They tend to choose which houses are released for each season by their significance in that season. So my question is, will the Martells or Tyrells play a larger role in the upcoming seasons? (Example: if the Martells don't play a major role, I'll buy that one now because it has less of a chance of being rereleased). Also, without specific spoilers, could you maybe post predictions on which covers will be released for future seasons? As in, which major houses do you think will play the largest role in the show moving forward by season? (with the exception of the big 3, which will probably keep being rereleased regardless. 


Sorry if any of this was unclear, I realize it's somewhat confusing. Also, for those curious, here is the list of slipcover released for each season so far:

*Season 1: Stark/Targaryen

*Season 2: Lannister/Greyjoy

*Season 3: Stark/Targaryen/Lannister

*Season 4: Stark/Targaryen/Lannister/Martell/Tyrell",16,6,False,self,,,,,

There are lots of plot hints and reveals contained within the book. I'm not talking about the cool new deep background reveals (e.g., Lady Tarbeck, who was the major adversary of House Lannister in Tywin's youth, was previously married to the heir of the house; Nymeria settled briefly on Sothyros, etc.), but rather the hints or reveals on major plot points.

A handful I've noticed:

- The Maester author strongly hints he believes there was a sexual relationship (possibly non-consensual) between Mad king Aerys and Johanna Lannister. This corroborates and expands on Barristan's ""liberties at the bedding"" line. The Maester also confirms that Aerys and Johanna (and Tywin) were at Casterly Rock when Tyrion was conceived.
- The weather effects of the Long Night were not limited to Westeros; the Rhoyne froze over.
- This is the first text confirmation that dragons were once native to Westeros.
- The insatiable Valyrian need for gold, possibly needed for magical purposes, and that Valyria knew of the mines at Casterly Rock. I've always thought it was strange that the Valyrian empire ended right off the shores of Westeros; it's even stranger with the new information, and the Maester throws up a Septon Barth quote about a prophecy and the theory that something bad happened to the Valyrians there. I've been a big fan of the theory that Westeros is inhospitable to dragons; this fact and the prior one seem to reinforce that.
- King Mern III of the Gardener Kings ""showered gold and honors on a woods witch who claimed she could raise armies of the dead to throw the Andals back.""

basically now that prince boromir is gone, robb and his brother are at castle north and have to take their father's place. but it turns out that robb's twin isnt a stark, he's a greyjoy so they send him home to be with the family again while robb takes on all the work for himself (robb is a very nice person!). so with the blond kid now going through a growth spurt or something he gets very angry with teenage angst. he's treating everyone badly, so now robb has to go and fight in the land of rivers. his older brother Ren Lee wants to be king now so he gets the people of the gardens to arm up and be on his side. but then his other older brother Stan Baratheon wants to be king, so now the blond kid and his brown haired brothers are all angry with each other. (ooooh i get it, because robb is the good guy and he makes families come together, and Stan Baratheon and his family are the bad guys so they keep fighting! nice symbology!)

So Stan has Melissa Lightlady on his side and she wants to reveal his destiny. But then theres the super blond girl in the east lands with dragons, but the dragons scared away the horsemen so now she has no one on her team. That's pretty much it.

 - No matter who you are, someone wants your head on a pike

 - If you're a lord/lady and you give a command expect to have it questioned at least once before you have to assert your dominance to get it done

 - Even if you are a lord/lady that doesn't mean jack. People will still disrespect you/challenge your honour/attack you with an army/sleep with you or a member of your family/show you too much loyalty and pay the ultimate price. These routes usually end up with someones head on a pike

 - Everyone has a bastard son

 - Ailment? Drink milk of the poppy. In fact, milk of the poppy for everyone! It seems to be dished around as a cure for any old problem, and whilst no one really seems to know what it does, no one questions it

 - All Starks like to start a conversation then end it mid flow because they have to be somewhere, but they promise to tell you about it properly when they next see you. This usually never happens due to heads on pikes

 - People are always getting interrupted mid sentence, typically whilst talking about something important, only to be told something even more important that requires their immediate attention

 - One way or another you will end up at the wall or trying to get there. If you don't, it will probably have something to do with a pike and head situation

 - Dragons gain respect, women struggle. In fact the pecking order goes something like Dragons, Wolves, Loyal men (espically Dwarves), the King, Royals, people who kiss the above's asses, Unichs, Knights, Soldiers, Men, Peasants, Women, Children, Whores, Animals and Theon

 - Joffrey is a little c**t",6,8,False,self,,,,,

So if height is removed I do not understand why Bjrnsson was chosen. 

Why do i have this unpopular opinion? Do I think he's a bad actor? Do I not like Icelanders?

Of course not, the problem is  Bjrnsson looks like a very nice guy. He looks too young, he looks to friendly, he may seem threatening but the guy doesn't look like he'd hurt anybody. He even (I think) visibly cringed when he talked about killing people when he caved in Oberon Martell's head. 

I am rewatching season 2 and Ian Whyte really fits the role, his voice is menacing and cold, without emotion, and his face looks stone cold. Also his face isn't so round, it's sharp, and his beard is dark. This is how I imagined The Mountain when reading the books. 

Bjrnsson...I think he could have been a better fit as one of Greatjon Umber's relatives. I will not elaborate on who those are.

Does anyone know why The Mountain was recast? I know the one from Season 1 left to play Bolg in the Hobbit. ",49,11,False,self,,,,,

I definitely still want her to take the Iron Throne. And when I said I was pissed, I was pissed at the character, not GRRM or his brilliant writing. I've said this in a couple of comments, but the fact that I'm able to be pissed at a character so strongly is just another example of why GRRM is one of the best writers I've ever read.

I planned a trip to Dubrovnik for this weekend for the sole purpose of seeing where they film the scenes from Kings Landing. Last night when I was telling my friend they informed me that they're still filming there right now. When I looked it up myself about a month ago I saw that they stopped filming there in September and moved to Spain (or something like that, again I totally think my facts could be wrong). I just wanted to know if anyone knew where I could find a reliable source in terms of their filming location aka if they will be filming when I'm in Dubrovnik, who will be there and what I should generally expect (and of course, potential ways I can meet the cast which would be so cool). I already booked a walking tour of the city to see all the main filming spots, will this be enough if they're actively filming?! Any insight would be much appreciated considering I'm a HUGE book/TV Show fan. Also like I said this is the first time I'm posting on reddit so if this is a stupid post please be easy on me haha.

I remember distinctly thinking the first time around that Stannis's decisionto proceed with the attack was suicidal, and the quote ""'Hundreds will die!' 'Thousands.'"" as an acceptance of his fate ie, ""We will all die attacking this city."" I was also under the impression that The Hound's vanguard was wrecking shit among the Dragonstone army, adn they were winning, as according to plan... until the Hound called retreat due to his own fear of fire. But he says inside that he had lost half of his men/ was losing, so was he winning or not? if he hadn't been so frightened and shaken up by the fire could he have held the Mud Gate on his own? Or at least could he have held it until Tywin arrived? Finally, with Tywin's arrival, who was aware of that happening? Did anyone in the city know he was coming to their rescue?

I also remembered a conversation in ADWD between Tyrion and Illyrio where Illyrio says that Varys used to call them mice instead of birds.

It says in the wikipedia article 

""Cuckold historically referred to a husband with an adulterous wife and is still often used with this meaning. In evolutionary biology, the term cuckold is also applied to males who are unwittingly investing parental effort in offspring that are not genetically their own.[1] Since the 1990s, the term has also been widely used to refer to a sexual fetish in which the fetishist is stimulated by their committed partner choosing to have sex with someone else.""

Hmm... Sexual fetish that involves someone having sex with someone else?

But then the wiki goes on to say this: 

""In Western traditions, cuckolds have sometimes been described as ""wearing the horns of a cuckold"" or just **""wearing the horns.""** This is an **allusion to the mating habits of stags**, who forfeit their mates when they are defeated by another male.[7] In Italy (especially in Southern Italy, where it is a major personal offence), the insult is often accompanied by the sign of the horns. In French, the term is porter des cornes, which is used by Molire to describe someone whose consort has been unfaithful. In German, the term is ""jemandem Hrner aufsetzen"", or ""Hrner tragen"", the husband is ""der Gehrnte"". Rabelais wrote the Tiers Livers of Gargantua and Pantagruel in 1546, by which time the symbol of the horns was ""so well-known and over-used that the author could barely avoid making reference to it.""[8] Molire's L'cole des femmes (1662) is the story of a man who mocks cuckolds and becomes one at the end. In Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (c. 137277), the Miller's Tale is a story that humorously examines the life of a cuckold. In Chinese usage, an altogether different allusion is used, when the cuckold (or wittol) is said to be """" (**wearing the green hat**), which derives from the sumptuary laws used in China from the 13th to the 18th centuries which required the males in households with prostitutes to wrap their heads in a **green scarf (or later a hat**).[9]""

Green hats and scarves? Wearing the horns of a stag?!?

COINCIDENCE?!?!

For background the group is currently located in The North.  They met in Mole's Town where they agreed to attempt to liberate a fallen stronghold.  The characters are listed below with brief descriptions. 

* Male Half-Giant ex-wildling Paladin; a devout worshiper of The Old Gods

* Female Warg from Sothoryos who has an African theme and a GoT version of an [African Wild Dog](http://i.imgur.com/U3IeAba.jpg?1)

* Male Cleric from The Riverlands; a devout worshiper of The Seven (mainly The Warrior)

* Male Minotaur Smuggler born at sea

Based on my understanding, and the HBO show as I haven't gotten that far in the books, Valaryan steel is essentially Damascus steel, aka steel folded and hammered 100s of times to create exceptional steel.

When Tyrion melts Ice to create Oathkeeper, and whatever the other one was named, the blades were cast to rough shape. They don't elude to it being folded and hammered. 

From my understanding, these two new swords while made from Valaryan steel would not truly be Valaryan steel.

And here is a scream from the cave troll in Moria in LoTR -[WARNING - LOUD]: http://youtu.be/69tK1-g7Pc8?t=21s

One thing that is obvious is that they have cut the scream short to just the initial burst, and the sample is not the entirety of that scream.

I'm still wrestling with how I feel about the decisions Jon Snow made in ADWD. I think I understand his plan to protect the wildlings so that they don't become wights, I guess. But regarding the decisions he made as a whole (constantly taking in more wildlings despite knowing there already weren't enough provisions, agreeing to Melisandre's plan to use magic and send Mance to Winterfell, and then at the end deciding to go take on Ramsay despite it being winter and despite that action being a clear violation of the Watch's policy not to get involved), I find myself really going back and forth on whether he was making brilliant or batshit crazy decisions. I can almost empathize with Bowen Marsh a little bit, even though Jon's ""fate"" was an even bigger bummer to me than the Red Wedding. 

I don't know if anyone else has wrestled with this or has any opinions that might help me decide where I land on the issue. Or hell, maybe this ambivalence was GRRM's intent and the answer is supposed to be murky. Thoughts?",12,3,False,self,,,,,

SPOILER ALERT!!

...

...

...

When Daenerys goes on her abolitionist campaign, she seems to be quite the vigilante. I just finished watching the part where she essentially crucifies the nobles of Mereen as revenge for nailing children. 

From what opinions I've read so far, people are supportive of Daenerys. On one hand, I absolutely adore the woman-power vibe that the Mother of Dragons has going for her. On the other, I can't help but shake off that Daenerys is either going mad, or she's just the same as any teenager given a high position of power and fleeting victories. If she were to have been around 15-16 when marrying Khal Drogo, then she'd be about 17-19 in the series if I'm not mistaken? Someone please correct me.

Yet, at the same time, that would also be Robb Stark's age, and he wasn't like that at all. True, Dany endured years of physical and emotional abuse from Viserys, but that would only serve as a catalyst to mental instability

What are your thoughts on this?

I haven't yet read the books (though I plan to soon!), and I don't really mind spoilers, so if any of you have comparisons with book Dany to Emilia Clarke's version, please let me know!",31,9,False,self,,,,,

I was beginning to wonder where he was this whole time! Wow, that epilogue caught me by surprise although I was a bit sad to see Kevan Lannister go! 

I'm really bummed out about Jon Snow. :(
Those stabbings that he took got me by surprised. However, what caught me more surprised about was the ""smoking"" wound he had before he fell face-down. Azor Ahai reborn?! 

Brienne came back! She is one of my most favorite characters in the series and seeing her come back made me happy until she needed Jaime to come with her, alone. Uh-oh! 

And new characters I truly enjoy are VICTARION GREYJOY and Jon Connington! I love the part where one of the captains of one of the ships made fun of Victarion because he thought he could sail the Dothraki Sea and Victarion just choked him to death and threw him overboard. 

Jon Connington is a favorite of mine. The way he wants to redeem himself  by helping Aegon claim the Iron Throne after failing Rhaegar is a story arc I want to see more in TWOW. Especially since it was revealed that he caught greyscale on his hands and he is slowly dying. Part of me wants him to accomplish his goals before he leaves, but we all know this doesn't have a happy ending. 

My mind is being blown away by all of what I just read! All these cliffhangers make the wait for The Winds of Winter even longer! So, any suggestions on what to do now that I have read the books? Any popular theories that the ASOIAF reader should know? ",23,12,False,self,,,,,

Thank you for coming to my aid. Seriously.

I'm in the awesome position of being able to do all my Xmas shopping online this year, in my pajamas, from the comfort of my home. I have detailed ideas for everyone's gift, but my mother is a tricky situation. Her birthday is on Christmas eve so, even though she always insists that it doesn't matter, I must get her two presents. It's just wrong not to acknowledge a family member's birthday. That being said, my mother is a plain woman. It's difficult to associate her with hobbies since she is so busy being a mother. She's a simpleton, makes her own wine but is certainly not a wine snob, and loves hockey. That's about all there was to her interests up until this year, so there have been A LOT of hockey-themed wine glasses for many, many years.

This year, however, she discovered Game of Thrones. She's always been a bit of a TV junkie, but has never LOVED a show. Now, Game of Thrones is all she talks about. She devoured the show from season 1 to season 4 in a matter of a week. She refuses to watch TV other than hockey games because, in her words, ""nothing can compete with Game of Thrones. I love it so much.""

It's great to see her so excited about something. Naturally, the idea strikes me to get her GoT-themed presents for her birthday and for Xmas. I didn't think it would be difficult. I thought I'd find something with a quick google search or a browse on Etsy, but I was quickly overwhelmed.

There's so many quotes I don't understand. Too many romance-themed gifts. Too much jewelry, which my mother would never wear. When I do find something romance-neutral that isn't jewelry, it has a theme for a particular ""house"". I do not know which house she prefers, if preference is even a thing.

She likes comfy, relaxed clothes so I thought of just buying a hoodie that says ""Game of Thrones"", but that seems unthoughtful. I thought maybe a book detailing how the show was made would interest her, but I can't skim through it and understand the content, so I can't tell if it's a good resource to the show or even interesting. She has no interest in reading the books of the series as far as I can tell. Perhaps I could get her one of the board/card games for Game of Thrones? She does enjoy playing board games with the neighbours. However, if the game is complicated, she is quick to get frustrated and storm away. I don't know how complex these games are or if they're enjoyable for someone who is an adult woman and not a teen.

Assuming budget isn't an issue (within reason) is there any GoT-merch that might seem like a good idea?",37,19,False,self,,,,,

Does anyone have any good sources on what they would have worn?  The pictures of the Nobles and Knights of the Targaryen's has it starting at scale armour for Aegon the Conqueror, all the way up to full plate for Rhaegar Targaryen.  I expect medieval armour of the type worn in the 13th century would be appropriate, but as the Targaryen's were rich and powerful, I think their regular house guard and soldiers would be dressed in something a little more ornate than what soldiers wore after Robert's Rebellion.

 I'm right now at Season 3 episode 9, i find the series to be good to great so far, i love Tyrion, Daenerys and Jon Snow so far the most but that doesn't matter.

 [S3E9](#s ""Last episode that i watched was S3E9 in which the Freys betray the Starks "")(hopefully that's not a spoiler for someone and please don't spoil anything past that for me). That, i didn't see coming before it had happened, only when the door was closed by that guard it was sorta obvious. I usually watch 2 episodes a day, another side track. I was a bit sceptic in the first season when they were talking how magic is a huge deal in the series, it used to be epic before but took a turn for the worst and it wasn't used anymore, then came season 2 and 3, and the magic has been used more and more, lord of flames and so on, i was completely on the side of the red woman, with that body i'dd turn to her in no time (not really).

 [S3E9](#s ""Fast forward to the episode end with Stark's getting ambushed, Rob's queen got stabbed, he got sliced and so on. "")But another random thing happened, i saw a random **glass of wine** in mid of those scenes on the ground. Episode ended and all went well, i usually go to sleep after this point, well i couldn't, something was slapping me on the wrists, take your phone, take your phone (not a real voice lel), so i did. It was dark already so i didn't see a thing, and that was where my misfortune happened. My phone was on charging, which i had remembered too late, but the thing i grabbed was my favorite glass (mug) that i have been using for the past 4 years and it didn't have a single scratch on it. Long story short, it fell and shattered into a 100 (didn't count) pieces (i could be sappy and write as did my heart), i was devastated and a bit disturbed by the connections with the last episode and my observation...

 That's about it, you're getting a new GoT fan, something random has already happened to me, among the 3 of my favorites so far, Bran is sorta a wildcard, if he could train his power to it's max, he could be a powerful card...

Proof: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color

""The eyes of people with severe forms of albinism may appear red under certain lighting conditions owing to the extremely low quantities of melanin,[65] allowing the blood vessels to show through. In addition, flash photography can sometimes cause a ""red-eye effect"", in which the very bright light from a flash reflects off the retina, which is abundantly vascular, causing the pupil to appear red in the photograph.[66] Although the deep blue eyes of some people such as Elizabeth Taylor can appear violet at certain times, **""true"" violet-colored eyes occur only due to albinism**.[67]""",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to get a GoT themed quilt or blanket (not fleece; don't like the feeling). I don't mind spending extra for quality. Also I'm not particular about the design, but my favorite house is Lannister.

**People with worse memory of the shows finales here is short recap of 4 season finales:**

**Season 1: Fire and Blood**

The news of Ned's execution quickly spreads to all corners of the Seven Kingdoms, triggering seismic events for each member of the Stark family. The North secedes from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaims Robb as their king. With Jaime captured by the Starks and Robert's brothers challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne, Lord Tywin Lannister appoints his son Tyrion as King's Hand to keep Joffrey and Cersei in check. Jon plans to desert his post at the Wall to avenge his father; his friends convince him to stay, and he joins the Night's Watch in an expedition to find Benjen Stark beyond the Wall. Daenerys learns to her sorrow that her unborn son is dead and her Drogo has been left in a vegetative state due to the witch's treacherous magic. Unable to bear her husband's ruin, Daenerys ends his life and lights a funeral pyre. She burns the witch alive alongside Drogo's body and her three dragon's eggs, and walks into the flames herself as the fire reaches its peak. When the embers die the following morning, Daenerys rises, unharmed, flanked by three newborn dragons.

**[*Here is a link to Season 1 finale preview video.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6VUuU8hIBM)**

**Season 2: Valar Morghulis**

The aftermath of the Battle of the Blackwater sees Joffrey set Sansa aside in favor of marrying Margaery Tyrell while Tyrion fears for his and Shae's safety now that his father has replaced him as Hand of the King. Melisandre gives the defeated Stannis a new hope. Brienne runs into trouble while escorting Jaime to King's Landing. Catelyn tries to convince Robb that his romance with Talisa is dangerous, but he defies her and the two are married. In Qarth, Daenerys ventures into the House of the Undying and successfully retrieves her dragons. She then seals the traitor Xaro Xhoan Daxos inside his own vault and claims his riches for herself to buy a ship. In Winterfell, Theon is betrayed by his own men in the face of an inevitable siege while Winterfell is put to the torch. Osha and Hodor sneak brothers Bran and Rickon away from the smoldering ruins and take them North toward the Wall. Arya, having escaped Harrenhal with Hot Pie and Gendry, receives the gift of a valuable coin from Jaqen. North of the Wall, Qhorin Halfhand forces Jon to kill him to prove his loyalty to the Wildlings and an army of White Walkers surrounds the Fist of the First Men.

**[*Here is a link to Season 2 finale preview video.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8yjZFl50SQ)**

**Season 3: Mhysa**

House Frey receives the Seat of Riverrun, Roose Bolton is appointed the new Warden of the North, resulting in a victory of House Lannister. Arya and the Hound witness Frey soldiers mocking the desecrated remains of Robb Stark. Arya stabs to death one of the men, marking the first time she kills a man, while the Hound kills the others. Yara Greyjoy begins a new military campaign to recapture Theon, who has been penectomized at Dreadfort by Lord Bolton's bastard son Ramsay Snow and begs for death in light of Snow's continued torture. Tywin chastises Tyrion for not having impregnated Sansa, and for placing his own desires over the needs of family. Jaime arrives in the capital with Brienne, and is reunited with Cersei. In the North, after crossing paths with Bran and guiding him beyond the Wall, Sam arrives back at Castle Black, where he and Maester Aemon send out ravens to alert the whole of Westeros about the arrival of the White Walkers. Ygritte catches up to Jon and tearfully shoots him full of arrows. Jon manages to escape and collapses before the gates of Castle Black, where Sam orders him to be cared for. At Dragonstone, Davos allows Gendry to escape and Stannis receives the distress call from the Night's Watch. After word from both Melisandre and Davos he now plans to move north and aid the Watch against the invading darkness. And across the Narrow Sea, the freed slaves of Yunkai receive Daenerys as their ""mhysa"", meaning ""mother"" in Ghiscari.

**[*Here is a link to Season 3 finale preview video.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4paRnLmWI)**

**Season 4: The Children**

Jon Snow treats with Mance Rayder, but their negotiations are interrupted when Stannis Baratheon and his army suddenly overrun the wildling army and take Mance prisoner. Later, the Night's Watch burn the bodies of their dead while Jon burns Ygritte beyond the wall. Bran and his party come upon the large Heart Tree from his visions, but as they arrive they are attacked by wights; though Jojen is killed, Bran, Hodor and Meera are saved by a child of the forest who takes them to the three-eyed raven. In Meereen, Daenerys responds to a former slave's wish of being sold into slavery again by allowing him to contract his labor to his former master on a yearly basis. The next citizen brings her the charred remains of his daughter who was burned by one of her dragons. As a precaution, Daenerys chains her other dragons in the catacombs. In the Vale, Brienne and Podrick come upon Arya and the Hound. Brienne mortally wounds the Hound, while Arya escapes. Meanwhile in King's Landing, Cersei orders Qyburn to do anything to save the Mountain, who is dying of wounds from Oberyn's poisoned spear. She confronts her father, threatening to reveal her and Jaime's incestuous affairs if she is forced to marry Loras (after which, she rekindles that same affair). Tyrion is released from his cell by Jaime, but he later finds Shae in Tywin's bed and kills her. He then confronts his father in the privy and shoots him with Joffrey's crossbow, before escaping the city with Varys. The season ends with Arya buying passage on a ship bound for Braavos with the coin Jaqen H'ghar gave her.

My current GF is a big fan of the love romance between Petyr and Caitlyn, and I would like to know more about that story !
Actually, I would love to tell her how much I love her in the ""Petyr way to Caitlyn"". 

I know it sounds strange, because i've read some things on the internet (About the duel and stuff), but nothing more. 
I would like to know wher Petyr confess is love to Catlyin, and try to do the same here. Sound strange, but i'm sure she'll love that :).
Or other question, is he making any ""special gift"" to her ? Something really special, that means a lot to her ?

Thank all of your for your help !

It's been a while since I've watched the LotR movies (the first 3, leave The Hobbit out for now) and I also didn't watch everything of GoT quite yet. (The show, not the books). The 3 first movies of LotR vs. Season 1-4 of GoT.

Everything from the universe, characters and the time period to budget, actors and filming techniques etc etc. Anything worth comparing. At all.

What I've digged up so far by myself are some keywords that I'll be able to elaborate on later;  
GOT is more realistic and portrays how living in those times actually was. It also contains sex, nudity and rape as opposed to LotR which iirc shows none of it. They are both a struggle for power, however in LotR there is a clear good and evil. LotR also has an important magical object the movie revolves around. Both have mythical creatures (dragons, LotR has a lot more). LotR also has magic and I wouldn't say GoT has magic. The time period in LotR is 20 years, however most of the films happen during 3 years. As of GoT I have no clue, please fill me in. I'd assume a couple of years. LotR has timeskips while GoT doesn't?

Some of what I typed above might be a bit wrong due to my memory being faint and I haven't watched either in some time. So, please, correct me if it is.

If someone could spare some time and lend me a hand here I'd be very grateful. Be it keywords, just a rant or a full text.  
Thanks!",29,4,False,self,,,,,

The goal of this experiment is to gain some knowledge about how much of the important ASOAIF backstory/character lore you non-readers have gathered from only watching the TV-show, because as most book readers will know, a lot of the major incidents which took place *before* Ned Stark bacame King Robert's hand have only been adressed very briefly in the TV series. As a book reader, the lack of in depth exploration of these vital backstory events/characters in the HBO series worries me quite a lot, and I fear that the show might loose a lot of steam when it catches up with the books, simply because of how important the pre-season 1 lore becomes in especially A Dance With Dragons, and presumably will become in the two final books. As so, the main goal of this experiment is to shed some light on just how much of the backstory those of you who have not read the books are familiar with.

**Staying spoiler-free**: In order for this experiment to work and to keep it free of spoilers, it is absolutely vital that everyone who has read even as much as a few chapters of the first book **stay out of the discussion** as much as possible. Information gathered from the books has the potential to ruin the entire experiment, because as previously mentioned, the goal is to find out just how much of the ASOAIF backstory someone who has only seen the show has been able to pick up on so far. By keeping the discussion strictly ""show watchers only"", it should be possible to avoid spoiling anything important for you guys, since the information given will have been obtained through watching the show.

**The actual question**: Okay, so without looking up any information on the internet, I'd like the non-readers of this subreddit to tell me and everyone else everything they know about the character of **Rhaegar Targaryen**, using only the knowledge they have gathered from watching the 40 currently available episodes of the Game of Thrones TV series.

Why do book readers of dramatic/suspenseful material complain when a detail or event is changed/omitted from a screen adaptation (show or movie)? On one hand, I understand being faithful to the source material and maintaining the story, but there should be at least a little wiggle room for change and creative control by showrunners after characters are established.

Changes can make something worse, but the argument behind that should be inclusive. For example, maybe the change was boring or annoying, or perhaps it is inconsistent or contradicts something else they've shown ON SCREEN. The reason shouldn't be, ""It was different in the books"".

A show or movie should be its own entity once the premise is set and the characters are established. Faithfulness to source materials shouldn't be the sole test for how good a different medium is. Don't you want to be surprised at all when watching a dramatic/suspenseful story? If you don't, then why are you watching it when you know exactly what is going to happen?",24,0,False,self,,,,,

Tyrion shoots this down causing the reader to believe Littlefinger had some type of hand behind the assassination attempt. Who really tried to get Bran killed? Was it the Lannisters or Littlefinger? 
2. This question is just from the series because I haven't gotten that far in the books. In season 2 or 3 Stannis and Melissandre curse Robb Stark and King Joffrey with the blood of Robert's bastard.  Why the heck did Stannis want Robb dead? Stannis spoke highly of the Starks and seemed to have no quarrel with them. In fact, they seemed more allies than enemies. Robb never wanted the iron throne so why did Stannis wish him dead?

**People with worse memory of the shows penultimates here is short recap of 4 season penultimates:**

**Season 1: Baelor**

As the Stark and Lannister armies prepare for their first battle against one another, Tyrion leads his barbarian allies into battle while Robb and Catelyn bargain for a renegade Lord's help. With Drogo dying from an infected wound, Daenerys goes to desperate measures to save her husband's life by using a witch's blood magic, much to the horror of the Dothraki. At the Wall, Maester Aemon reveals himself to be a Targaryen  and the price of loyalty  to Jon, who worries about events outside of the Wall. In a final bid to save his daughters' lives, Ned falsely confesses to conspiracy and swears fealty to Joffrey as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. To the horror of Ned's daughters  and delight of the assembled crowd  Joffrey has him executed.

**Season 2: Blackwater**

Stannis Baratheon's fleet assaults King's Landing in the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Leading the defense, Tyrion Lannister destroys many of the attacking craft with an exploding ship full of wildfire, and is forced to lead a counterattack as King Joffrey and his bodyguard Sandor Clegane each desert the battlefield. Stannis' forces make it inside the castle, but Tyrion leads his men behind the Baratheon forces via underground tunnels and attacks. Meanwhile, Queen Regent Cersei, holed up in the fortress with Sansa Stark and the other ladies of the court, succumbs to wine and despondency as she believes the battle lost. In the nick of time, as she is about to poison her son Tommen, Tywin Lannister's forces, joined by Loras Tyrell, the lover of Renly Baratheon, arrive to dispatch the attackers.

[***Here is a link to Season 2 penultimate episode preview video.***]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCQS3PmTTs8)

**Season 3: The Rains of Castamere**

Sam and Gilly arrive at the Wall. During a thunderstorm, Bran enters Hodor's mind to calm him down. Nearby, Jon refuses to kill an innocent man, so Tormund orders him killed. Bran uses his warg ability to save Jon, and Jon kills Orell then escapes, leaving a furious Ygritte behind. Osha, Rickon and his direwolf depart for the Last Hearth, while Bran and his remaining company plan to head beyond the Wall. Daenerys sends Jorah, Daario and Grey Worm to infiltrate Yunkai and open the city gate for her army. Yunkai soon falls to her forces. Robb arrives at the Twins and apologizes to Walder Frey, who feigns acceptance. Edmure marries Roslin Frey, but during the wedding feast, Walder Frey's men murder Catelyn, Talisa and most of the Stark bannermen, while Roose Bolton kills Robb. Arya also arrives at the Twins and witnesses a part of the massacre, but the Hound knocks her unconscious and carries her to safety.

**Season 4: The Watchers on the Wall**

The Night's Watch prepare for the coming invasion by the wildlings. Gilly arrives at the Wall shortly before Mance Rayder's army. The wildlings attack from both sides, with one army climbing the Wall, and Ygritte's army attacking Castle Black. After Ygritte and her army get through, a bloody battle ensues. The wildlings attempt to break through the tunnel leading into Castle Black with the help of several giants and a woolly mammoth, but are stopped by Grenn and five others, who die holding the tunnel. Alliser Thorne goes down to the main level of Castle Black to fight, leaving Janos Slynt in charge. However Slynt proves to be incompetent as a commander, and is tricked into going down the main level, effectively leaving Jon in charge. Pyp is shot by Ygritte and dies in Sam's arms. After watching Jon kill Styr the Thenn, Ygritte prepares to kill Jon, but is shot by Olly, who finally gets revenge on Ygritte for killing his family. Jon holds Ygritte in his arms as she dies. With the help of Jon's direwolf, Ghost, the Night's Watch secure the ground level of Castle Black. The wall climbers are sliced apart and completely obliterated from a massive scythe that acts as the Wall's secret weapon. The wildlings retreat, but, Jon predicts, not for long. Seeing no other choice, he goes beyond the Wall to find and kill Mance.

After the Night's Watch defeats the mutineers and frees Craster's wives and daughters (Craster's widows?), **how will they remain safe?**

They can survive by raising crops and farm animals and what not, but **how will they survive the White Walkers?** Craster and the women were ensured safety from the Others/White-Walkers by sacrificing baby boys.  **What happens now that they can't produce any baby boys?**

Again, we're using *show canon* -- we only have what we see on TV as evidence/support up to and through the most recent episode.

They certainly understand that the sacrifices of the baby boys have protected them, as they flat out say as much to Karl and they chant ""for the gods"" when they offer up *Craster's 101st baby*. **^1**  

Craster's wives and daughters were ""raised"" by Craster and his wives, but they were essentially slaves with no freedom.  Then, when Craster was killed, they still had no freedom.

After they get rescued by Jon and the NW, they finally get their first taste of ***freedom*** as *free*-folk.  It's perhaps this first taste of freedom that leads them to **refuse** Jon's offer of the shelter and safety of going to Castle Black.  Not only is there the sweet taste of freedom, there's also the threat of ending up in the same situation as they were just in (with the mutineers), or ""at best"" -- from their point of view -- the threat of being harassed and raped by rogue members of the NW anyway... despite the virtual certainty that Jon intends to protect them and allow them true freedom (with just the requirement that they earn their keep).  Obviously, the women don't know Jon well enough and they don't trust the NW.

So, I don't blame the wives for being afraid of the NW and not trusting them.  

But from their point of view, I see pretty much **four possible options/outcomes**:

* 1) They choose to accompany the NW and trust them.  They get raped, brutally beaten, and enslaved.  Then, they get killed by the White Walkers.

* 2) They choose to accompany the NW and trust them.  They truly are treated as fairly and humanely as the NW can manage, which still results in some harassment -- but there's no rape or slavery.  They live out their days as maids, cooks, servants, farmers, cleaners, etc.  Then, they get killed by the White Walkers.

* 3) They choose to stay at Craster's Keep to live out their days as ***free*** women, as ""free-folk.""  They *know* that they'll eventually be killed by the White Walkers -- but at least they'll be killed as truly free-folk, and if they believe the White Walkers to be gods, then they'd die at the hands of their gods.

* 4) They choose to stay at Craster's Keep and hope that their previous sacrifices protect them from getting killed.  They're truly free now, and maybe they won't get killed by White Walkers, and even if they did, they would be killed as free-folk.  

To me, I think **#3** was the most likely reason why they refused Jon's offer.  I think they *know* that they're eventually going to get killed -- but at least they won't be raped or beaten, or even work as maids, cooks, servants, etc.  **Basically, they've accepted death and chosen to die as truly free-folk.**  

Otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense as to why they would stay if they wanted to stay alive, since there are no baby boys being produced anymore.  

**TL;DR -- How will Craster's widows find safety from the White Walkers without the ability to sacrifice any baby boys?  It's an all-female population, and life will not, uh, find a way.  My thought is that Craster's widows understand that their ""gods"" -- the White Walkers -- will eventually kill them, but at least they'd die as truly *free* women, as they wouldn't be brutally-beaten sex slaves at NW, or even, at best, fair servants, maids, cooks, cleaners, farmers, etc.**


**^1**  In an earlier episode, there was an interesting conversation between Craster and Jeor f---ing Mormont, and Craster asks, ""have you ever met a man with 99 sons?""  Later on, Gilly would have the 100th son, and when Karl and the mutineers sacrifice a baby, it's the 101st son.  I wonder if either baby will have significance on the show.  ",9,5,False,self,,,,,

I was binge-rewatching the season, so when it reached the final episode, and Tyrion shoots his father on the privy, it made me think for a second...

He just committed patricide.  He (technically) had previously committed matricide (his mother dying while giving birth to him).  

He didn't mention, say, regicide (killing a king), and he had no part in Joffrey's death.  He didn't mention homicide, and you could argue Shae was self defense (she grabbed a knife before he had done anything).  

Going back to what he did say, there's infanticide and suicide.  Infanticide?  According to the wiki, he and Tysha were together for two weeks, and secretly married, between first meeting and the rape by the guards that was ordered by his father.  And no one really knows what happened to Tysha after that.  

Was she pregnant with his child by that point? (They do specifically mention that Tyrion and Tysha had made love at least once, plus...the bad stuff could have caused a pregnancy as well.)  Tyrion was basically forced to rape her last.  Then he never sees her again, believing the story that she was a whore, when she was actually truly in love with him.  

Maybe, those awful events, and him leaving her, caused her to commit suicide.  And, in a way, at the same time infanticide.  

Meaning Tyrion was ""responsible"" for the four -cides that he names.  While the two prevalent -cides that are left off the list, he's either clearly not responsible for, or it can be argued it was self defense (or at most, manslaughter in modern-speak, acting in the heat of the moment/not pre-meditated).

Or, Speculation-B - those horrible events caused a miscarriage in Tysha, but she went on living.  Which would mean suicide would be the one last thing Tyrion hadn't been a part of, hinting at his future?",11,26,False,self,,,,,

The characters, the music, the story, the pacing, the twists, all fantastic. I loved how 3 dimensional even the villains are. I think the scene that hit this home for me was Tywin finally acklowledging Tyrion as his son. That really warmed my heart even if i did hate his guts by then. The worldbuilding was really good too and i liked how much they shrouded in mystery instead of telling us outright. Like the free cities or the other great houses. Lots of great lore and amazing sets that really blew me away. You could cut through the atmosphere with a knife, it's that thick. And the aforementioned twists. I had heard that GoT would be an absolute deathfest but i liked that they kept it sparse and played up the drama of all deaths. It really worked to the shows advantage and made me care a lot more.

So that aside i have a question for you. My friends told me to watch the shows so we could discuss it but i haven't read any books yet. So where do i go now? On one hand i want to just jump right into season 2 because 1 was so good but on the other i always wanna read the GoT book so i have both experiences before going forward. So how do you recommend i do it from here? Thanks in advance.",37,19,False,self,,,,,

So the story we have been seeing for the most part has been the war of the roses. The war between the houses of York, lancaster and Tudor. Seen here as Stark Lannaster and Tyrell. 

And With the books winding down, and by now all the major pieces in place so that you can pretty much pick out what is going to happen.

I am giving to think what other story could be told in this setting. what happens after the dream of spring. 

Well I think George gave us a hint of what happens though I doubt he'll be writing it. I think we've rather soured him on this world. and He's not getting much younger so that he can take time off and return to write another series. 

But I think he gave us a fleeting glimpse a clue as to who comes to rock the world he created after westeros is stable again. 

A stallion mounts the world. 

Now we see a bit of the Dothraki when Dany marries Drogo, but he dies unexepectedly and they dothraki are just sort of there from then on not really a fact just the few that stayed loyal to Dany. 

And this is typical of steppe peoples in our world from time to time many of them will gather behind a cult of personality type of leader and they will become a devastating force but then that leader dies and they scatter to the plains again fracturing into rival chieftans and tribes.  We saw this When Drogo died his Khalisaire broke apart going off behind his stronger underlings and only a fraction staying with dany. 

But We also saw something from Drogo that could point to something like the mongol invasions coming from the dothraki. 

He says the gods told him his son will be the stallion that mounts the world. 

Of course He dies and Dany's child dies and we all assume that there goes that threat that this potential Ghengis Khan, astride a dragon ripping through essos and westeros, never comes to pass. 

BUT this leaves a hint. One of the trademarks of the Mongol Empire, was this idea that they were divinely ordained as the rulers of the world. That they were the will of god made flesh. the wrath of the gods given physical form that their conquest.  And this idea was put into place by Ghengis Khan. And We this idea introduced to the  Dothraki.

I think would be great fun to read GRRM's retelling of the mongol horde through the lens of his world. With all the brutality and the sex and politics and the fact that it's all over in a flash historically speaking Ghengis Khan rises  and builds this massive empire and it's broken less than 3 generations later. Yeah pockets of it linger  and his grand children split off into different houses and khanates but the mongol empire only sees 4 true ""great khans"" before it's broken apart. Ghengis, one of his sons and 2 of his grandsons. 

I would like to see the Khal that becomes the great Khal who unites all the khalisaire of the great grass see and Who takes this horde across Essos nearly wiping out the religion of the lord of light(like the mongols nearly broke the muslim world) Breakign and sacking the free cities.

And once more the the mongols actually beat the russians in winter! imagine winter has come to westeros and the sea is frozen and across the frozen sea comes a thundering horde of dothraki to smash the 7 seven kingdoms!

I know George wont write this but I feel like he should let someone do it for him if he chooses not to. ",8,3,False,self,,,,,
