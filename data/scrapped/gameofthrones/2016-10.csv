So my theory is basically that in season 1 Sam states he wants to be a wizard to John, it was played off as a somewhat sarcastic comment but judging by the significance of the library Sam discovers at the end of season 6 it leads me to believe that he learns magic from the library. My guess is that he will have a huge hand against in defeating the White Walkers given how outnumbered and over matched the Northern Kingdoms are, or potentially he saves what is left of the northern army after being defeated, retreating to Danarus and the dragons in a plea for help? This is all assuming the wall comes down, which seems apparent and potentially will be through Branden's mark on his arm given by the Knight king, having the same affect it did on the cave with the three eyed raven.

there has been few talk about how Dany might take 2 riders as husbands like Aegon did

&gt;My queen, he said, and the bravest, sweetest, and most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Daenerys -
Your Grace!
Your Grace, he conceded, the dragon has three heads, remember? You have wondered at that, ever since you heard it from the warlocks in the House of Dust. Well, heres your meaning: Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar, ridden by Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya. The three-headed dragon of House Targaryen - three dragons, and three riders.
Yes, said Dany, but my brothers are dead.
Rhaenys and Visenya were Aegons wives as well as his sisters. You have no brothers, but you can take husbands.

Daenerys speaks of the possibility to Prince Quentyn Martell a year later, 

&gt;The boy seems pleasant and well spoken, but 
House Martell is ancient and noble, and has been a leal friend to House Targaryen for more than a
century, Your Grace. I had the honor of serving with Prince Quentyns great-uncle in your fathers seven.
Prince Lewyn was as valiant a brother-in-arms as any man could wish for. Quentyn Martell is of the same
blood, if it please Your Grace.
It would please me if he had turned up with these fifty thousand swords he speaks of. Instead he
brings two knights and a parchment. Will a parchment shield my people from the Yunkaii? If he had come
with a fleet 
Sunspear has never been a sea power, Your Grace.
No. Dany knew enough of Westerosi history to know that. Nymeria had landed ten thousand ships
upon Dornes sandy shores, but when she wed her Dornish prince she had burned them all and turned her
back upon the sea forever. Dorne is too far away. To please this prince, I would need to abandon all my
people. You should send him home.
Dornishmen are notoriously stubborn, Your Grace. Prince Quentyns forebears fought your own for
the better part of two hundred years. He will not go without you.
Then he will die here, Daenerys thought, unless there is more to him than I can see. Is he still
within? Drinking with his knights.
Bring him to me. It is time he met my children.


suggesting that her marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq need not be the end of Quentyn's hope to marry her, but his reaction to her dragons causes her to dismiss the idea

&gt;She smiled. My prince. It is a long way down. Are you certain that you wish to do this?
If it would please Your Grace.
Then come.
A pair of Unsullied went down the steps before them, bearing torches; behind came two Brazen
Beasts, one masked as a fish, the other as a hawk. Even here in her own pyramid, on this happy night of
peace and celebration, Ser Barristan insisted on keeping guards about her everywhere she went. The
small company made the long descent in silence, stopping thrice to refresh themselves along the way.
The dragon has three heads, Dany said when they were on the final flight. My marriage need not be the
end of all your hopes.  
  
.

&gt;The Dornish prince had gone as white as milk. I  I had heard that there were three.
Drogon is hunting. He did not need to hear the rest. The white one is Viserion, the green is
Rhaegal. I named them for my brothers. Her voice echoed off the scorched stone walls. It sounded small
a girls voice, not the voice of a queen and conqueror, nor the glad voice of a new-made bride.
Rhaegal roared in answer, and fire filled the pit, a spear of red and yellow. Viserion replied, his
own flames gold and orange. When he flapped his wings, a cloud of grey ash filled the air. Broken chains
clanked and clattered about his legs. Quentyn Martell jumped back a foot.
A crueler woman might have laughed at him, but Dany squeezed his hand and said, They frighten me
as well. There is no shame in that. My children have grown wild and angry in the dark.
You  you mean to ride them?
One of them.   
  
.

&gt;My fathers favorite palace. It would please me to show them to you one day. They are all of pink
marble, with pools and fountains, overlooking the sea.
They sound lovely. She drew him away from the pit. He does not belong here. He should never
have come. You ought to return there. My court is no safe place for you, I fear. You have more enemies
than you know.

People are misunderstanding me :/ I didn't want the Starks to go south and destroy every family, I just wanted a more compelling end to Arya's already-lacking show arc. Just imagine a small legend spreading in Riverrun about a deadly and mysterious assassin, who we viewers know to be Arya, and her re-appearance next season with perhaps another killing, on-screen this time. 

TL;DR: Arya's scene in S6E10 was an unsatisfying revenge to the Red Wedding. I have 3 ideas of how it would've went better imo. Please change my mind on the scene. 

Edit: So a lot of people are saying that I am desensitized to violence. If that is the case, why would I suggest that the best end to Arya's season 6 arc is an off-screen end? When I said ""unsatisfying"", I didn't mean I wanted a gruesome death for the Freys, I meant a more compelling and mysterious way of developing Arya's storyline instead of a shock scene. Just imagine she becomes a small legend in Riverrun before re-appearing next season. And to people saying I'm a sadist, I'm not the one who cheered when Walder (a human being) ate his sons (also human beings) and was killed by Arya. Just saying ;)

When Arya takes revenge on the Red Wedding in S6E10, did the whole scene seem unsatisfying to anyone? We don't see Black Walder's or Lothar's reactions and demise, and Walder Frey's reaction was kind of underwhelming. Even his death seemed quick and ordinary (yet our favorite characters died in horrible or treacherous ways). To top it off, no one witnesses the Starks' revenge. The whole thing could've been off-screen and would have had the same impact imo. 

Believe me, I tried very hard liking that scene, as much as I loved the whole episode. But I can't. This seemed but a poor and quick revenge for one of the most painful and horrifying scene (from a viewers perspective) in the whole show. It might be because I am not a die-hard fan of Arya (I am a fan nonetheless, just not on a Jon Snow level), or because the Red Wedding left a huge emptiness the first time I watched it that's not easy to fill. 

For those of you who loved the scene, can you please change my opinion on it? Why did you love the scene? What made it satisfying? Why do you think this was the right way for the Starks' revenge? 

For those like me, what would you do differently? In my case, I have 3 ideas (and I like the third one most of all): 

 Jaime and his men take out the Freys during the feast in the earlier scene. That would've been a sort-of poetic justice. 

 Arya assassinates Walder during the feast. We viewers could've then witnessed the Freys' and Lannisters' reactions. 

 We don't see it at all. Instead, we hear different stories of what's happening in Riverrun during the KL, Winterfell, and Jaime and Bronn travel scenes (for example, Qyburn mentions there is an assassin wreaking havoc at the Twins, Sansa tells Jon that a raven from Riverrun came saying that Walder died by eating pies made of his sons' remains, and a messenger tells Jaime that Walder was killed, when Jaime asks who killed him, the messenger replies ""no one""). The story is scattered in the episode, and we viewers are left on the edge of our seats until we find out at the last 2 words (no one). 

Leave your comments below, I want to know everyone's opinion on the scene and on my ideas :) ",28,0,False,self,,,,,

49,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-10-2,2016,10,2,4,55eu58,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] The Same Ol Rhaegar Theory?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/55eu58/everything_the_same_ol_rhaegar_theory/,mcwinston,1475351355,"When I first heard the whole ""Mance Rhaegar"" theory I was lolin pretty hard. Even after SOME evidence I thought, ""Eh, I guess it's possible..."" but when he was killed in the show I figured there was no way. Today I got a little bit more information (Most from The Last Harpy of course. Also did he not do that video already?) that seemed kind of irrelevant before and some that should have been the snake that bit me and I am starting to come to my own vague conclusions/possibilities and think I am much more leaning towards this being the case. Please add on, fix, flame, whatever on what I've begun piecing together. 

So the normal ""obvious"" clues to Rhaegar being/becoming Mance are, as I see it, the following:

Rhaegar's body was not found after the battle of the trident

Rhaegar's rubies are mentioned several times in the books as being glowing. This being important because of how rubies are used in GoT with body transformation magic.

Rhaegar and Mance were/are both loved by many, had a great fondness for music, donned red and black (Mance's cloak), have ""King's blood"" which would be weird for a random dud

So then it gets to more of the book content than TV, but I will try and defend that what can still be relevant in the [TV show].

Dany has an extra vision (well quite a few) during her time in the House of the Undying that shows her a beating heart that pulses indigo light. She also confuses Rhaegar for her brother in either that same vision or a previous one, but can identify him because of his indigo eyes. [This I find unlikely to be brought back to, but it could be a dream she has or possibly a flashback to her trip to the House. I actually like the flashback to a scene they didn't do because they could do the same thing to add the Valonqar part of the prophecy for Cersei. Would be 2 greats starts to episodes, imo.]

Mance is still alive in the books, saved by the ruby disguise magic. This also points to the possibility, if we believe the theory, that the rubies were used to disguise somebody else during the Battle of the Trident in place of Rhaegar. [I believe this is still possible in the show through hidden rubies, as to not be a dead give away to the fans who were already speculating this]

Mance's songs are a huge point in the direction of Rhaegar. He has strong knowledge of Southern songs and sings them frequently, despite being from the North. One of the songs he alters to talking about kidnapping the Northman's daughter (Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna) [Haha, all I have for this is another potential start to an episode, maybe subtle hints from Tormund or have him clearly singing over scenes involving Rhaegar. This I really don't see happening]

Mance frequents visits to Winterfell, possibly for his love for Lyanna. [This one is easy from Tormund, he could casually bring up Mance going to Winterfell without it seeming out of place. ""Mance often spoke of his trips here. Not sure why he'd go through the hassle for some stones covered in snow"" or something to that extent is easy filler]

I may have missed a few, these are almost word for word from several theory videos online, I don't mean to claim them as my own I just want to bring them to anyone else's attention who may not know.

So today I started connecting dots that may be parts of different puzzles. 

For one, Howland Reed. Where has he been? What has he been doing? Is he helping protect Jon, Bran or possible ""Mance Rhaegar"" indirectly via Green Seer abilities (Jojen has them, who else in the family does)? Could he be the critical missing piece to every puzzle in this series? I know it may sound a little silly, but he was at the ToJ with Ned which makes him one of less than like 5 people who knew Jon's true identity. He was also saved by Lyanna at the Tourney of Harrenhal when being picked on by a few others. I think that we have seen him with Ned in the show so we like to think they are the close ones, but I have a feeling that it was Lyanna and him that got close after this and he potentially returned the favor by helping assist with getting Rhaegar somewhere safe if he actually was in grave condition at the Trident. House Reed is in control of a stronghold at the Neck which is where the Trident originates so this would be easier for him than most others.(EDIT) The Neck was also known to have been heavily blessed with green seer/CotF magic. With a bloodline that may run deep with magic, but at least has a little, he could have potentially played a part in either disguising him or healing him. I also believe that while the contrast of fire and nature makes it easy to keep them separated, green seers and Targs and even the followers of the Lord of the Light are much more connected than we think. Obviously we have Brynden Rivers.

(EDIT)Extra tinfoily here: In the flashback scene Howland goes down in a single blow immediately and is said in the books, iirc, to not be very strong. Yet somehow he manages to get up and still plunge a knife in Dayne's back and, as far as we know, lives past this. DOUBLE COMBO BONUS TINFOILLY: When he goes to one of the fallen men he doesn't flip them over but just kind of checks him really quick. If there is any evidence of green seer healing magic he could have both helped heal himself and be looking to heal those who were dead.

Is it possible that Rhaegar's connection to Maester Aemon played a part in his ending up at the Wall when he needed to flee North? They were said to have sent ravens between one another and if he thought he was the PtwP, then getting closer to the Wall and all things North of it could help him learn how to defeat his supposed archrivals. Not to mention Aemon was probably unidentifiable to most of the realm, having foregone his name, and nobody would piece the two together without prior knowledge of him. There's also a theory video on how Jon's name might be Aemon which is kind of supported through Jon pretending to be Aemon the Dragonknight in a play battle with Robb and the mouthing of the name in the show and possibly this connection with his uncle, maybe a hint left to help discover where he went as well? I dunno if we can actually trust the mouthing or if part of this is actual evidence to his identity, but I thought I'd throw it in here.

I know everyone wants Tyrion to be the 3rd head, but if Rhaegar was still alive he could still be a 3rd head and NOT the PtwP. Or part of the group that composes the PtwP if you believe it is multiple people. Rhaegar dedicating so much to these prophecies could actually point to his reasoning for staying in hiding for so long, especially if he believed him and Aemon were the only 2 Targs remaining. ""A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing."" is something that I think supports but also may hurt the theory. If he believed this he wouldn't have wanted Rhaegar to leave the wall, but at the same time Rhaegar would not have been too far and if he meant from the perspective of other houses/bloodlines knowing that he was alone then he would have been safe as he was under the Mance name.

(EDIT) Oh lord I just had a super ""N'yohmahgod"" moment in the shower. Mance left the Night's Watch because he couldn't wear his cloak that was red and black, right? And he said it was patched up by a wildling woman who use scarlet silk from Asshai to patch it as well as healed him up. I believe he left because if he took off the cloak he would be revealed as Rhaegar and I believe the magic nature and of the woman in general may also either be a reference to somebody in the Neck, a follower of the LotL who may have also been the source of him hearing all the prophecies, and/or a confirmation of healing magic for green seers. I believe that along with most of his other stories were all fabricated long in advance and were helped to be spread through the use of Aemon. This would tie up virtually everything in this thread too. Should it all be true of course :3

Yeah so have at it, let me know what you think. Add on or correct, whatever you want. This is partially for me to all have collected as well!

My only knowledge of larger book lore comes from reading wikis and being a little ways into Clash on my first and current read. Is this really just a continuity error in the show (the graffiti in that scene was pretty awful, so it might be), or is it more complicated than that? I think D&amp;D are smarter and more aware of the larger canon than people give them credit for, so I want to believe it wasn't a careless mistake.

I remember reading a long time ago that Valyrian is like Latin, that modern languages are all derivative of classic ""High Valyrian"" and are a sort of ""Low Valyrian"" dialect. Maybe Ghiscari falls under this umbrella. Then it would be technically true that it's a ""(Low) Valyrian"" word while at the same time Daenerys might not have been familiar with it. At the same time, it seems like specific languages have been pushed aside for the tighter narrative in show canon. Braavos and other Free Cities speak the Common Tongue, which is not the case in the books. In the show it feels like the only three languages are the Common Tongue, Dothraki, and Valyrian...and Old Ghiscari I guess. I'm not very informed about all that, though.",16,11,False,self,,,,,

First, I haven't seen anyone discuss the conflict in Samwell's storyline, which is the stealing of his family's sword.  What can he do to prevent his dad from just taking it back ? And what good will it be there for Sam anyways? It's not like the maesters don't already have a stash of valyrian steel since they make the chain links for magic out of it.

My prediction is that he will send it to the wall to help the watch against the walkers, and out of reach of Randyll and his men. But that still leaves Sam open to retribution in some way. What do you think will happen to him?

Secondly, I'm reading a lot of people's predictions about Euron and his fleet and how they are going to be used.  Everyone seems to think they'll engage Daenerys somewhere on the east coast of Westeros in a big sea battle... but I think there is an important piece of foreshadowing in season 6 that no one has noticed. 

We all remember Euron's glorious introduction where we find out he is actually a storm in mens clothing (see: ""I am the storm, brother""). Well in the finale, right before being elected King, Jon divulges a critical piece of info to his people: ""The war is not over, and I promise you friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm.""

So there you have it, Euron won't go east, he'll go north and team up with the White Walkers. And when they come south (maybe using their ships to go around the wall), they'll bring Euron and the Ironborn with them, thus bringing the storm.",18,4,False,self,,,,,

128,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-10-3,2016,10,3,5,55jynf,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] Why do so many people think ____ will be heading North in Season 7?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/55jynf/everything_why_do_so_many_people_think_will_be/,StateYellingChampion,1475438602,"A recurring theory I've seen in lots of threads is that Arya will be reunited with Jon and Sansa in the North in Season 7. Why are so many people of this opinion? The last we saw Arya she was at the Twins killing Freys. It seems as though she has set herself to crossing all the names off her list. Here are the remaining names on her list:

* The Red Woman

* Berric Dondarrion

* Thoros of Myr

* Ilyn Payne

* The Mountain

* Cersei Lannister

Berric and Thoros captured Arya shortly after her escape from Harrenhall, so it's reasonable to conclude she hadn't ventured very far from Harrenhall when that happened. So it would be reasonable for her to try and pick up their trail around the same area. Harrenhall is South of the Twins. With the exception of the Red Woman, the rest of the people on her list all reside in King's Landing in the South.

It would be a pretty big reversal in her character arc for Arya to place a love of family above her desire for vengeance at this point. She endured two years of abuse in Braavos so that she could acquire the skills needed to extract her revenge. I think people root for Arya, Jon, and Sansa and want to see them happy. A Stark family reunion is something we would all love to see happen for them. But beyond a desire to see it happen, I don't see much evidence within the show itself to support the idea it will come to pass in Season 7. Instead, I'm thinking Arya will head to King's Landing and become a thorn in the side of the Mad Queen. The complete Stark family reunion, if it happens at all, will likely be a Season 8 occurrence.

But am I missing something?",122,83,False,self,,,,,

So now i have some questions:

* How were the 2 wights in book/season 1 (Jafan flowers and the other guy) able to cross the wall? (I know they only came back to live after they crossed, but still doesn't really explain it)
* If Bran crosses the Wall, will it lift the spells (or even bring down the wall) because of that spot on is arm? Or can the Night King only use that spot once because else he runs out of mana?
* Why is everbody so worried about the White Walkers if they can't even cross the wall? Maybe they don't know this, but shouldn't some dude from when the wall was built mention that they can just let the WWs stand their?
* Do the WW know about the Horn of Winter, is the horn that Sam finds together with the obsidian in Ep. 2x10 the actual Horn of Winter, and most importantly do you think the Horn of Winter can actually bring down the Wall?

I might just be stupid but its a little unclear for me.

I don't know how I've managed to duck and weave my to this series untouched, but I have and here I am.

I enjoy fantasy and medieval, magic, dragons, etc. I've been an avid fan since childhood.

I read JRR Tolkien, JK Rowling, my Dad read David Eddings to me as a child. I play The Elder Scrolls. I'm currently waiting for The Walking Dead s7 and 12 Monkeys s3 and I'm currently watching American Horror Story s6.

Okay onto Game of Thrones. I watched the first episode a few years back and at the time I didn't really have the mental energy to commit myself to another show (was watching TWD and 12M). I enjoyed the first episode enough to decide to pick it back up at a later date, but now I'm looking at a 7(?) season haul and its a bit daunting. But I'm willing. 

When I say 'unspoiled' I mean all I know is that lot of people die, frequently.

So, my questions to the fandom are; Is this a show that I can invest myself in? How is the pacing? Is it worth starting now, even though I'm so far behind? Do you think I will enjoy it? And what is your personal opinion of the show?

I'm in for the long haul and I don't really nitpick unless its a continuity error. 

Also, if anyone has any issue with this post I'm sorry. I forgot a spoiler tag and I probably don't even have the right one now. I did read the guide, carefully, but that thing has its own spoiler list that I almost eyed. 

~Cat

Edit; I'll update everyone once I've seen the first season. I'll either edit that post after each season or just wait until I'm caught up. 

Thanks everyone!",93,18,False,self,,,,,

This scene had me speculating on the possible development for the dragons in the future.

As the show has never mentioned the famous ""the dragon has three heads"" prophecy, and with rumours of a single dragon being involved in a massive set piece for season 7. It's also been reported a character is to fall into the water after falling from one of the dragons. 

Do you think it's likely that Viserion will bite the dust? resulting in only two dragon riders, with Dany &amp; Drogon and Jon &amp; Rhaegal (would be a great tribute to a father he will never know). 

I can't see Tyrion being revealed as a Targaryen due to it undermining his development with Tywin. I also cant see D&amp;D incoporating it at this point, with no hints or anything unlike R+L=J

I know the blade is made of Valyrian steel, which is lighter than regular steel but wouldn't the sword's length will be a problem in battle for a normal guy? In the show they've showed Ned fighting with a regular long sword, But it might be due to practicality, because a shorter sword will be more comfortable for an actor to wield. I can't remember if the books explicitly say that Ned used it in battle.

Edit: The comments are pretty much indecisive, but I learned few things about swords and Ned today so that's nice. From what I can gather here Ice sized swords was used in real life combat, but Ned prefered a regular long sword for his reasons.

Grey Wind- Robb
Obvious symbolism of Robb's strength on the battle field. As well as when they were both killed and made into a joke by sowing the wolfs head onto Robb.

Lady- Sansa
Back when they were still together you knew Sansa sewed and acted like a lady. When Lady was killed Sansa slowly became less of a ""lady"" and became a woman.

Nymeria- Arya
Nymeria was forced to run away due to the Lannister and has been lost in the Riverlands which is where Arya is currently. This was foreshadow if I've ever seen it. We know this from the books and have not seen any thing involving Nymeria in the show after Arya makes her run away.

Summer- Bran
Summer may have been a representation of the actual summer. After Summer was killed North of the Wall, not too long after the white Raven appeared signaling winter(HBO Series). In the books he defends Bran and survives the Wights attack.

Shaggydog- Rickon
I forgot about both of these guys so I guess they are similar. Both were killed by Northerners. Boltons and Umbers (HBO Series). In the books Shaggydog and Rickon are still alive with Osha.

Ghost- Jon
Ghost is the largest of the dire wolves. When Jon and Ghost go North of the Wall they lose who they are. Ghost acts like a wild wolf and Jon joins the Wildling but they return to Castle Black as crows. Ghost is White in contrast to his brothers and sisters. This is probably a representation of Jon's lineage being half Targaryen among his ""cousins""(HBO Series)/ brothers and sister. Ghost has close bond with Jon and almost has a warg connection.

Jon Snow on the other hand, is a character that I love. His underdog progression is much more natural and likeable. He won the support of the north and the wildlings on his own merit. Whereas Dany got her dragons because of magic. Took the unsullied illegally from Master Kraznys. 

Jon Snow went from being the bastard that even people like Rast made fun of, to being proclaimed the king in the north.

And Dany, well, got eveything she has because of magic and slight deceiving in the first place.

Just my 2 cents.

I read somewhere that Daenerys won't play a part until mid-season, thereabout. I can't really see this being true myself. 
Although, I don't think there will be any rush to see her take the throne from Cersei. There was far too much time put into Cersei's power grab to see her downfall rushed.

Maybe the first few episodes will focus on Cersei/Jaime - Euron/Theon/Yara - Stark reunion.

I'm also guessing Sam; Gendry, wherever he may turn up; The Brotherhood; Bran's visions.

I'm thinking they may wait until episode 6 to address the whole White Walker invasion. Meaning Bran may cross the Wall episode 5?

a lot of people have theorized it would be ok for jon and dany to wed. after all, targaryens married for years. but dany's character arc doesn't seem to follow the arcs of her ancestors. she's all about enacting change.

politically, it would really help her campaign to ally with the starks. but jon isn't the only option for her to achieve this.

i don't mean bran. i mean sansa.

i think this might be a fulfilling possibility from a narrative standpoint for several reasons.

- sansa will return south victorious.
- jon and dany don't need to have an inter-family relationship.
- if jon is legitimized, it won't be as a stark, but a targaryen, so he won't hold winterfell as long as sansa/bran live anyways.
- dany's future relationship with sansa could be foreshadowed by a relation with yara.

Am I the only one that feels that the political intrigue of the series, or the Game of Thrones, the best part of the series. To me, it seems that we have come to a bit of an impasse with the series. The science fiction aspect will only continue to grow and while it won't necessarily turn me off but I do think the show has been losing it's impact. The characters are in dire straits but it's obvious now and there is a clear good and bad guy. 

For example, many people got instantly hooked by the first season and that had a lot or all to do with Ned and the sensitive nature of Kings Landing. Some of the show's biggest moments have come from it ala the ""Red Wedding"", ""Battle of the Blackwater"" and just this past seasons funeral pyre of death.  

So what do people think? Are you more excited for the finale to the ""Game of Thrones"" arc or to the Whitewalker threat?",28,4,False,self,,,,,
293,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-10-5,2016,10,5,8,55wkzr,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] Dragonbinder - The forgotten treasure.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/55wkzr/everything_dragonbinder_the_forgotten_treasure/,POL1T1CS,1475624792,"In the books **Euron** has **Dragonbinder**, also called **Hellhorn**. It's a horn said to posses the ability to control dragons. The horn is six feet (*1.83 meters*) long. It is made from the horn of what must have been an enormous dragon. It has a black gleam, and is banded with red gold and Valyrian steel. When touched the horn feels warm and smooth. 

-

&gt; **Dragonbinder** is brought to the kingsmoot by **Euron Greyjoy** when the ironborn elect a new King of the Isles and the North. **Euron** claims to have sailed the **Smoking Sea** and found it amongst the smoking ruins that were **Valyria**. The horn's noise silences all at the kingsmoot and ends the possible fight between the supporters of Euron's brother, Victarion, and his niece, Asha (*Known as Yara on the show*) Greyjoy. The horn's noise sounds like the screaming of a thousand souls and it seems to listeners as if their very bones are aflame and searing their flesh from within. **Cragorn**, the man who blows the horn for **Euron**, collapses with blisters on his lips, and the tattoo he has of a bird on his chest is bleeding. 

-

&gt; **Cragorn** dies later. When a maester cuts him open to examine the cause of death it is discovered his lungs are charred black as soot.

---

What's interesting about this horn is that it promises control over dragons, but also whoever uses it, burns from the inside out. So only those who are immune to fire can use it? Well, not according to **Moqorro** who says **Victarion** must be made the horn's master and he must claim the horn with blood. So perhaps a blood sacrifice will allow the user to use the horn without worrying about the consequences? Hmm.

---

# Tinfoil Speculation:

-

I know it's not with **Euron** in the books, and he has given it to **Victarion**, but perhaps this was all skipped in the show because they wanted it to remain as an element of surprise for when **Euron** uses **Dragonbinder** in Season 7. In my opinion, **Daenerys** will leave her party and take Drogon for a ride around Westeros before returning to her ships (*insert scene of Drogon flying over King's Landing in Bran's vision*); while she's on her journey, her army will be attacked by **Euron** and his **1000 ships** before reaching **Westeros**. He will use the horn to steal the remaining dragons, and hurt a large number of her army. Forcing the survivors to regroup at **Sunspear** (*Dorne*) under the leadership of Varys/Tyrion/Greyworm/Sand-Snakes. After-which they begin mounting an attack on **King's Landing** from the South via land, rather than from the sea (*with or without Daenerys*).

---

What will Euron do with **Viserion &amp; Rhaegal**?

-

**Scenario #1**: **Euron** will take the Dragons north, and **Viserion OR Rhaegal** will be saved by Bran (*via warging, to break Dragonbinder's spell*), while **the last Dragon** will be sacrificed and given to the Night's King north of the **Wall**. Becoming an Ice-Dragon for the Night's King to ride.

-

**Scenario #2**: **Euron** will take the Dragons and attack King's Landing or make an alliance with **Cersei** and chain the Dragon's in the famous Dragonpit.

Her cheekbones and her love for her children aren't her only redeeming qualities.

First of all, she had an unrequited infatuation with Prince Rhaegar, whom her father had promised her to. Prince Rhaegar then fell in love with Lyanna Stark and 'kidnapped' her, probably devastating Cersei deeply. She spent the next 17 or so years married to a man who also loved the same woman instead of Cersei. She would have been jealous of Lyanna her whole life. I mean, Bobby B even whispered Lyanna's name in Cersei ear on their wedding night! Also, her life as queen was not at all glamorous. Her husband spent most of his days drinking and whoring, popping out new bastards in every tavern and brothel he could find.

A few years after King Robert's death Tywin then promised Cersei to Loras Tyrell, a marriage she **really** did not want. Her father constantly used her as a pawn to 'better the family position'. He literally said to Cersei upon announcing the arranged marriage, ""you're still fertile, you need to marry again and breed."" She is just an object to Tywin that can be used to give more power to House Lannister.
She has constantly been underestimated by her father when she is the child that respects him and tries to be like him the most.

She once said something to Tyrion along the lines of, ""If it weren't for my children, I would have thrown myself from the highest window of the Red Keep."" Now her father is dead and all three of her children are dead, the only thing that kept her going. She has nothing left to live for except for Jaime and nobody is on her side (besides maybe Euron Greyjoy) so her fate is doomed.

Don't be so hard on Cersei. She may be a ruthless bitch, but she's been through a lot!

The announcement of R+L=J in the season 6 finale was indeed a satisfying one for us, but who are the people aware of this now that we know of?
Some possibilities may be...

Howland Reed - Accompanied Ned in the battle at TOJ, possibly learned the truth about Lyanna's child
Benjen Stark - Possibly aware of Jon's heritage through Eddard
Aemon Targaryen - Protected him throughout his Knight's Watch, ""A Targaryen Alone in the World is a Terrible Thing""... *scene cuts to john* (possibly just foreshadowing, but the way Aemon speaks / acts with Jon is a little fishy to me )

and obviously...
Eddard Stark - TOJ, Lyanna's brother, etc...
Bran Stark - Witnessed TOJ flashback though Weirwood tree.

In the scene swap between Lyanna's child and Jon Snow (One of my favorite scenes in television), We change over to Jon, eyes wide, symbolizing he is the child of Lyanna Stark. Eyes, being a huge part of this story, could be telling us something else in this scene.

We see Jon in this scene, blank stare. My first analysis of this was the director trying to make sure the point gets across of the eyes belonging to the same person. 

After a few watches back of 6x10, it looks to me as if Jon is in some sort of a day dreaming state. That look someone has on their face when they doze off and you snap your fingers, that look, when they come ""back to reality"", blink, slightly shake their head. A confused snap back to reality after possibly SHARING this vision with Bran. As if maybe, Ned, or some greenseeing attribute allowing Jon to learn his true heritage.

What does this mean for the story?

Jon is now in Winterfell, within the crypts is his true mother. Possibly because of this vision shared with Jon, he learns a few things...

- His real parentage that has been hid from him
- Bran is still alive
- To check the crypts he has been afraid of 

TLDR; Jon snow saw the vision with brand, now knows he is not the bastard son of Ned, is aware Bran is alive.",36,13,False,self,,,,,

But when you factor in production costs (I've read that the episodes can range from $5 mill. - $10 mill. to produce) how can they possibly be turning any kind of profit?

Let's talk direwolves.

Currently, two of the Stark direwolves are still alive (Ghost, Nymeria), and four are dead (Lady, Grey Wind, Shaggydog, Summer). And their names are all directly related to their owner and circumstances.

Sansa's, **Lady**, was first to die. Her death was the first real sadness of Sansa's life and the turning point where she had to quickly mature as she discovered Joffrey was, y'know, Joffrey. Lady's death marks the end of Sansa's innocence and youth, and is a pivotal stepping stone to her becoming a lady.

Bran's wolf, **Summer** is obvious. He dies when summer ends. ""Winter has come,"" says Sansa, at the end of the same season.

Rickon's, **Shaggydog**, is named after a [shaggy dog story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story) in the real world: a story with no climax or conclusion. Rickon's life (and his stupid inability to run in zig-zags) went many places, but had little to no impact on the overall story. If Rickon was the character you were rooting for in this show, I am afraid you were following a shaggy dog story.

**Grey Wind** helped Robb march and conquer his way across Westeros. The Stark sigil is grey, and it is not hard to see the 'grey wind' phrase as an allegory to Robb's war through the story.

As for the living wolves, Jon's **Ghost** is clearly named to indicate Jon's presence after death.

Finally, Arya's wolf, **Nymeria** is leading a pack in the middle of Westeros somewhere. She is named after a legendary warrior queen of Dorne. And to be honest, it's the only wolf that hasn't yet seen its name become relevant. Arya is a bit of a warrior, of course. But is that really enough? Not only that, but [a writer should only hang a gun on the wall if they later intend to fire it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun). It is an easy bet that Nymeria will come back to Arya. 

But my personal belief is that it's stronger than this. GRRM could have used *any* name for this wolf, and the whole legend of Nymeria seems created for the purpose. I don't see Arya conquering Dorne, but can you imagine an ending where Sansa and Jon are lost in battles/plots... and Arya is the Stark who lives?

I haven't seen this theory elsewhere and the few times where I posted it, it didn't get much attention since it was buried in other replies replies/discussions.

First off, as a premise, here is what magic in GoT is attributed to the CoTF. Fair warning, I'm in the process of reading the books, but I ain't done, so most of this is from the show, some from other theories/discussions I read on here, some of which are based on the books:

1. The ability to see the past, present and future in ""greendreams"", the act of ""greenseeing"", in some cases forcing the ""caster"" to go to sleep, in others the visions will mix with reality while the caster is conscient (Jojen watching his hand on fire).
2. The ability to control animals and lesser minded creatures, including Hodor. We don't know if this skill can go beyond this, but I think it can, keep reading. Note also that book and show-wise, as far as I know, all known instances of this are done while the ""controller"" appears to be outside his body, ie: the mind transfers to the animal/person, leaving a blank or empty body behind.
3. The CoTF also used magic to control the weather, this is how they flooded the Arm of Dorne and the Neck/Riverlands in order to protect themselves from invaders (I think it was the First Men?)
4. The CoTF are able, using dragonglass/obsidian, to convert a human into a white walker
5. The CoTF used runes and similar things to create some of their magic, the arrangement of the rocks around the weirwood tree, the place where they created the first walker, etc.
6. The White Walkers clearly have inherited the use of this magic, we have seen several occurrences of this in the show: Walkers creating a new walker from one of Craster's babies, them arranging the bodies as a rune/symbol in episode one, them arranging the horses of the Night's Watch in a spiral, the Night King clearly having some form of greenseeing capabilities, walkers bringing a storm with them at Hardholm, etc.

I could go on but you see the picture.

My theory is that the White Walkers are a twist on the evolution of humans through robotics. The CoTF created the the White Walkers as a weapon to defend themselves from invaders (The First Men, and later the Andals), in the same way us humans are creating robots for the military, be it flying drones, teleguided tanks/bomb robots, exosuits, computer-driven targeting systems, etc. The CoTF created the  Walkers for a purpose, but they lost control on their creation and that creation became their evolution.

We can see evidence of this, first off, the CoTF are practically extinct as far as we know, there are several references in the books that after creating the Walkers, despite ""winning"" the war, they could never recover from their losses. The White Walkers on the other hand, seemingly immortal, have remained and are evolving, refining the magic they learned (and/or possible stole) from the CoTF. They are also reproducing, using again the magic of the CoTF and humans, creating new baby walkers that we can assume grow to be adults later on (the fact most walkers look alike except the Night King is an indication of this, they are all Craster's sons, so it's normal they all look alike).

Taking this idea further, I think White Walkers, or more specifically the Night King, has researched/improved the CoTF magic to levels beyond common measure. This is possible mainly because being immortal allows for a being to continually, potentially infinitely, sharpen his mind and develop new levels of intelligence, refine existing concepts/knowledge.

My theory is that the Night King is a master greenseer/warger/necromancer/magician, whatever you call it, and this is how he raises and controls the wights. I think that like Jojen, he can greensee without going to sleep. Furthermore, I think he has the same ability with warging, he can warg into people/animals while remaining conscious. Lets take it a step further: I think he can also do both of these simultaneously (like Bran controlling Hodor) and not just that, but on numerous subjects at the same time.

Clearly, you cannot control something that is dead, it has no soul, the brain is rotten... BUT, through greenseeing, the past can be visioned, including of course the past of dead people. Warging, as shown by Bran, can also be done through greenseeing, so theoretically, a greenseer/warger could warg into the mind of a dead person and control his dead body through the greendream.

Even if very intelligent creatures cannot be controlled, this doesn't ruin the theory. The Night King simply needs to warg into these people at the very last second of their life, when they go limp/dumb from the lack of blood/air/whatever other failure that caused their deaths.

So basically, I think this is how wights work... The Night King is multitasking x100000, greenseeing the last second of the life of every wight under his control and controlling them through the greendream, warging their minds.

If this theory turns out to be true, it means Bran could potentially be the key to stopping the Walkers. If somehow he can reach similar levels of mastery of greenseeing/warging, I can think of a million ways he could stop the Night King. He could for example simply warg into him when he was a little kid before turning and forcing him to suicide... He could perhaps sever the link he has with the wights... or even take over the wights himself, etc.

This also brings another very interesting possibility. Who do we know that died, but isn't dead? Jon.... The Night King could theoretically control LIVE Jon through this same power, since Jon, at his time of death, became unconscious/dumb/dead, that very last second of him  as he died on the floor.

But today i'll put out another theory now i do not know if this is already a theory or not but i am going to put it out anyway. That is that Bran Stark is Azor Ahai, The Prince that was Promised, one of the three heads of the dragon, The savior of Westeros. Now you may find it strange but Bran fits the bill. Let's look at the evidence:

Awakened Under a Bleeding Star: he was under the red comet

Born Admits salt and smoke: Bran cried Salty tears at the beheading of that guy Theon killed at Winterfell can not remember his name but that could be the salt. and Bran exited the crypts of winterfell it was destroyed and there was smoke so he was Reborn admits salt and Smoke.

Blood of the Dragon: if Bran were to Warg into a Ice Dragon or one of Dany's Dragon he in a metaphorical sense has the blood of the Dragon.

LightBringer: The Dragon he wargs into could be Lightbringer.

Nissa Nissa: Meera could be his Nissa Nissa or maybe Hodor was the sacrifice.

The Only one i could not find a strong connection for was Awakening Dragons from stone. but there is two more books left and two more seasons left so he has alot of time to fulfill that part of the prophecy. Bran fits the requirements. Bran is Azor Ahai.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

With Game of Thrones (more so in the past than the most recent season), the predictable story line never ends up being what happens. I exclude season 6 from this because there were a many instances where it seemed obvious what was going to happen and that exact same thing happened (Jon Snow being resurrected,  the Knights of the Vale swooping in during the battle for Winterfell, and Bran being the conduit to Jon Snow's parentage reveal).

The predictable plot at this point would seem to me: Dany arrives at King's Landing, Danny takes the city, Danny and Jon Snow meet up somehow and possibly marry as they join sides and defeat the White Walkers with dragons and dragon glass. Not so bittersweet, so maybe a character or two dies during the battles. Also, Bran and Arya have some key moments that guide this overarching plot.

However, I don't think the story will be this simple, and I really think there is going to be a major twist regarding the White Walkers and the things we think we know about our characters. Here are my thoughts on a potential, bittersweet ending, and I'd like to hear other's thought's on it or your own ideas:

1) Bran causes the wall to fall (due to his mark) and the White Walkers being to march through the North.

2) Bran discovers that the wall was built as a truce between men and the White Walkers that deteriorated as Rangers and Wildlings went further and further North.

3) Bran provides this information to Jon, planting a seed that a truce is a possible outcome against the army of the dead.

4) Meanwhile, Dany does indeed sack Kings Landing. I don't expect Cersei to die at this point.

5) Dany's reign grows more and more terrible. The people of Westeros are against her and her Dragons.

6) Dany cannot control her Dragons, who begin to pose a menace to all of Westeros. She begins to rule by death and destruction in order to keep the kingdoms in line. She has been shown to be on the brink of being a ""mad"" ruler and a fair and just ruler, but the situation in Westeros causes her to  descend slowly into madness.

8) People begin fleeing North, including Jamie, Arya, and tragically, Tyrion. The brotherhood without banners flee north as well, including Sandor. Cersei stays in King's Landing to serve as Hand of the Queen.

9) Meanwhile, up north, the White Walkers continue advancing south. Perhaps there are a few battles lost by the North and they're pushed further and further South, taking up the Twins as their temporary residency.

10) Stuck between the chaos and destruction from both Dany's Dragons (fire) and the White Walkers (ice), and based on Bran's guidance from earlier, Jon Snow attempts to make a truce with the White Walkers. The White Walkers fear dragons - they have awoken at this time precisely because they believed Dragons to be gone from the world. When they find out that this is not the case, they know that they can be killed. They accept the pact.

11) The main end-game battles are between the North (King of the North and his armies + White Walker Armies + those who fled the South including Jamie, Tyrion, and Sandor.

12) During the final battle, many White Walkers are killed, but ultimately Dany and her Dragons are defeated, perhaps killed by knowledge that Samwell learns while at the Citadel. Cersei is killed during the battle by Jamie, thus fulfilling that prophecy. And Sandor kills zombie Mountain during this battle as well.

13) After the battle, the truce is restored, the wall is rebuilt, and Jon Snow rules the North, Yara rules the Iron Islands, and Tyrion is left to rule the rest of Westeros.

The bitter-sweetness is in the fact that the person we thought would be Westeros's savior (Dany) ends up becoming the primary antagonist and that the White Walkers are not defeated in the end. They're merely appeased. And, of course, a few more characters we care about may die by Dragons.

Interested in hearing others' takes!

EDIT: Thanks for the discussion guys. Lots of good points below. I may have to tweak my theory a bit. I'll definitively revisit this post after each of the next two seasons. 

Also, a lot of people are asking about other characters. While I'm sure some may have significant roles as to how the situations unfold, I didn't necessarily include every characters roll in causing the situation. For example, Littlefinger may play a pivotal role in bringing Cersei and Dany together, for example, but in the end, that's not an important enough plot point to predict and call out specifically in this high level summary. 

Finally, I see a lot of people talking about how Dany is different and has Tyrions counsel. Don't forget that without Tyrion's counsel, she would have murdered all of the masters in Slavers Bay. Another thing that jumped out to me recently was her almost sociopathic reaction to splitting up with Daario. I could see her easily getting overwhelmed with ruling Westeros as her dragons make matters worse and ultimately making a poor decision causing Tyrion to flee. Perhaps she feels that the white walkers need to be destroyed at all costs, after the point where most of the rest of Westeros have worked out a truce with them. Perhaps her vision of the thrones room broken and filled with snow makes her believe that destroying them is the only way to maintain her rule. Or perhaps Jamie does kill Cersei sooner rather than later and Dany sentences him to death which Tyrion cannot support. 

My main issue is that if everyone where to act how we think they were to, there isn't much story there. The leadership of Westeros will not be the primary concern of the last two seasons. It will be how the white walkers are dealt with given political turmoil in Westeros. I think the idea of a truce that some are for and some are against will bring the most drama and excitement to the end of the series versus Dany, Jon and Tyrion team up to beat the White Walkers, regardless of how many characters we care about die.

The reason R+L=J is such a compelling storyline is the faith we have in the promise Ned makes to his sister on her deathbed. The reason nobody in Westeros knows Jon Snow is a Targaryen bastard is because Eddard Stark willed it that way. He kept the lie from everyone, including his wife, to the shame of his family, because he promised he would. That's a plausible scenario in the North.

But there is canonical evidence that Aerys was infatuated with Joanna (just check her Wikipedia page), and in King's Landing, that could not have been a secret. So if Joanna Lannister leaves the city suddenly and gives birth to a misshapen dwarf nine months later, you have to assume that a few people in King's Landing would have at least talked about it. And as the true parentage of Joffrey Lannister proved among the people of King's Landing, a good rumor is hard to put down.

If Tyrion, intelligent as he is, were actually a Targaryen, wouldn't he himself be aware of it by now? He would have heard the rumor as a young boy, and laughed it off. When he hears it again, years later, from someone who sounds like they know what they're talking about, he'd start to consider it. When his father flat out tells him, ""since I cannot prove that you are not mine,"" he'd start to have questions. By the time he speaks to dragons and they act like they understand him, his agile mind must have started to connect the dots.

What makes Tyrion such an incredible feat of fantasy literature is his self-awareness. How can he, of all people, not know who his parents are?

What made me think this was seeing the Baptistery in Florence. It has 8 sides, and according to Wikipedia, ""The octagon had been a common shape for baptisteries for many centuries since early Christian times. The number eight is a symbol of regeneration in Christianity, signifying the six days of creation, the Day of Rest, and a day of re-creation through the Sacrament of Baptism."" 

Now to me, that sounds like a bunch of made-up crap. ""It's the seven days of creation.... plus one!"" Good on the fine builders of Westeros for sticking to their guns and not adding an extra add-on to make it an octagon. ",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Dany starts to assert herself and falls in love with her husband; meanwhile her brother becomes enraged and treates to kill her , to steal her eggs, etc; her husband kills him- but people say"" oh, well, she did not even care about her brother after all""

Dany, in despair, to save her husbands life, turn to magic and trust a witch who was out to take revenge on her; this woman is the sole responsible for killing her son in her belly, and to leave her husband in a vegetable estate; Dany sets her in a pyre and burns the woman, but she also walks into the flames; she could have died, but by doing this, she got her 3 dragons.

Then Dany is horrified when confronted by the reality of slavery; she decides to put her own plans on hold and liberate as many slaves as she can, using her dragons and her Army. As expected, the slaveowners were not happy and engaged in pretty horrific acts of violence. Dany then answers  in the only language they understand and kill the masters.- but she is a terrible woman, stepping on those peoples culture, disconsidering the economic tragedy the abolishment of slavery will bring.

Dany decides to stay and rule , as a way to certify herself slavery will stay in the past and because she needs to learn; after all, she was not formally educated and is barelly out of her teens- but yes, people say she is shitty ruler, that she has only good intentions and nothing else.

Dany comes from a long line of nobles who praticed incest and her father and brother both succumbed to madness; However her mother and older brother were sane; her direct ancestry prior to her father were not affected by madness; to reduce a daughter of a mentally ill father acomplishments because she has a case of madness in her family is a very prejudiced thing to do. 

I do not think GRRM would write 7 books just to revert to some sort of biological determinism in the end. 

But what I do think is that the madness and her familys tragedy haunts Dany. 
She represents change and change is scary. She just happens to not be too shy in getting her hands dirty to make the world a better place. She is forcing part of Essos to end slavery. I see her doing something similar to Westeros....

After the Middle Ages and the Religious wars of the XVI and XVII centuries, Europe experienced the Enlightment...the century of Lights...

It would be too much of a jump to have Westeros, in analogy, jump to democracy, but there is something in between: Constitucional Monarchy. I think Dany will limit the authority of the ruler  and will start representation for the main sectors of society .",38,0,False,self,,,,,

I had a couple of ""big"" takeaways that I wanted to put out there and see what you all make of them.
When Bran sneaks into a weirwood root vision without 3ER's permission and gets touched by the Night King, this is what triggers 3ER to tell Bran ""It's time for you to become me.""
Bran asks him, ""Am I ready?""
3ER replies flatly, ""No."" and then they launch into the Hodor flashback. (I think you all remember roughly at least what happens there)
At first, Bran thinks the flashback is like the others, they are there to observe the past and learn some secret about his family origins or something. Cut to Meera back in the cave, awake, with rolled-back-eyes Bran catatonic on the floor.
She gets an eery feeling, and goes running outside to check on the Children, and finds them staring down the Army of the Dead, lead by the Night King. He draws his weapon and begins to walk forward. The children bombard with their magic grenades, but unfortunately only hit the wights behind the 4 White Walkers (including the King) maybe they are out of practice...
The first ""Big"" observation I made: the night King's WWeapon (ok, that was a typo, but let's pretend I did it on purpose lol)
His weapon is a very large sword made (obviously) out of ice. That's not interesting. What is interesting was the shape of the weapon. It has a very long, curved blade (fairly wide) and a very long, 2 handed handle, almost like an axe handle or something. I am no weapons specialist, and have no idea what this ""sword"" would be called - but I suspect it might hint at the NK's origins?! It doesn't look like any other weapon I have seen wielded on the show. Of course, when he got converted into an Ice Zombie the NK could have crafted this weapon out of his magic ice, brand new. But the design was (presumably) inspired by something wielded during his lifetime. Anybody have ideas on this weapon's origins or implications?
The other ""Big"" takeaway from this episode was what it means to ""become"" the 3 Eyed Raven. In the excitement of the episode I had overlooked this detail the first time through.
The 3ER was teaching Bran not only how to watch and learn from history, but ho to change it.
While they are vision-questing, despite 3ER's full knowledge of the impending WW threat, the WW attack the cave. Meera tries to wake Bran so they can fight or flight the fuck out of there. She can't wake him. But, in his vision, Bran hears Meera's voice calling to him to ""Warg into Hodor NOW!""
uncertain, Bran looks to the Three eyed raven for guidance.
""Listen to your friend, Bran"" he says calmly (!!!)
You know what happens next.
So, the takeaway was - The 3ER knew all along what would happen, to Hodor, to himself, and to Bran (becoming ""marked"" by the NK)
The 3ER specifically taught Bran that he could interact with the past, to change/impact future events!
So, this implies Bran's role as the new 3ER will be to manipulate events with his powers. I know, there was already mass speculation in this regard, but I had not realized that it was so well supported by the dialogue in the show until re-watching this scene.
This scene also explains that Bran's ""mark"" from the NK will break any spells which prevent the WW from crossing/entering, essentailly meaning that Bran has nowhere to hide, including south of the wall. This makes me think Bran is destined to meet with the NK fae to face, and is (tinfoil time) a strong candidate to replace him for the next generation.
OOH - almost forgot - also in this episode was Jon Snow's farewell to Dolorous Edd, during which Jon stares at the wall for a few seconds and then says ""Don't knock it down while I'm gone.""
To which Edd replies, ""I'll do my best..."" (!!!) - more overt foreshadowing - ala Cersei repeatedly offering ""to burn cities to the ground"" to protect her children",6,1,False,self,,,,,

I think the story about Pod was a plant by Littlefinger to see if Ros was a spy. This would be much like how Tyrion routed out Pycelle by placing information.

When it is revealed that Ros is reporting on Littlefinger she provides him with two pieces of information: 1) Pod's sexual prowess 2) Littlefinger's plans to steal Sansa

Obviously Littlefinger wouldn't have planted his plans with Sansa but he could have made up an interesting story about a shy quiet boy. Ros says the girls were not very descriptive about what Pod did where they are usually descriptive. She goes on to say that Littlefinger didn't even realize the loss of coin. Littlefinger wouldn't have cared about the loss of coin if this was planned and the girls wouldn't have been descriptive if Littlefinger provided them with the story.

The main flaw with this idea that I see is that the word about Pod's magic cock would likely have gotten around quickly, but I don't think this is necessarily true. Only a few people know about Pod's experience. The prostitutes who slept with him, who wouldn't spread the rumor if it had been planted. Ros, who likely isn't spreading it around if she thinks its valuable enough to sell to Varys. Pod supposedly tells Tyron and Bronn what happened with copious detail, but we don't see that conversation. Pod is shy and quiet and just had sex for the first time, I can't imagine his story would have impressed Tyrion or Bronn very much. Bronn would be the most likely to spread it around in my opinion. Littlefinger probably had at least a short period where he could reliably think if Varys knew, his source had to be Ros. This also implies that Littlefinger had to somehow find out Varys knew this information. I think confirming this either from another spy or just a conversation later are both plausible. 

My theory about Pod prior to this was that Tyrion pre-paid and it was a set up to boost Pod's confidence, much like he thought his big brother tried to do for him once.

Being burned is a huge deal for him if he does survive in the books since he values his looks quite a bit.
I think it would be interesting to see the show keep him alive, and I think of anyone at the Sept he has the best precedence in the books so far for being kept alive. Do I think it's terribly likely? No, but it would be nice to see at least one Tyrell survive, and would help push Cersei further into madness if even one of her opponents lived through her attack.

Considering that he is seen as one of the most honorable men in the land, wasn't it dishonorable for him to side with the ""king"" when Ned is, in fact, the Protector of the Land?

As an aside, I understand that the gold cloaks turned on Ned and the Kings Guard are vastly outnumbered. However, Barristan does not seem like the kind of guy that fears death. I'm surprised that he did not do what appeared to be the honorable thing.

I wanted to go through the directors who have done the best work on the show, and choose those who most deserve to close out the show.

I will assume there will be 8 episodes.

This is ideal director list, prior obligations etc the list will actually be dramatically different.


Miguel Sapochnik : Brilliant Director loved by D&amp;D, has displayed interest in directing S8. He has a brilliant eye for creating gorgeous shots, and magnificent execution of the screenplays. (

Episode 6&amp;7

David Nutter : Perfect job on the RW, has gracefully handled some of the most momentous scenes in the show to date. Episode 1

Neil Marshall : Fantastic at battle scenes. Has a great eye for large scale high stakes scenes. Episode 2

Michelle Maclaren : Excellent at character scenes, and rich dramatic moments. Episode 3

Alan Taylor. One of the most underrated directors at Thrones. I feel he has directed some iconic scenes pitch perfectly. Episode 4

Jeremy Podeswa or Alex Graves : Possibly controversial choices. However I feel both of them are talented and able to deliver stunning work, i loved Alex Grave's direction in the S4 Finale The Children. And Jeremy's work on S6 Home. Episode 5

And finally

Who should direct the series finale, the final episode the show will ever film.

David Benioff and D.B Weiss : It is their show, They started it. And they should end it. They know the story and the characters better than anyone else (Show characters, George knows his book stuff better obviously). They have a great eye for directing as S4 opening episode was fantastic. (Only D.B is credited however they have said they co directed that episode). I know the actors would want this, and the crew. I believe due to all the hard work, blood, sweat and tears they have put into it. They will not rest until the finale is as close to perfect as they can get it. Also directing an episode you wrote makes for a more cohesive episode.

So that would be my dream director list. What do you think? who would you replace?",11,7,False,self,,,,,

Anyhow as I finish the books I'm re-watching the show. Last night I wrapped up S1 as I'm almost finished with ACoK and want to start progressing into S2/S3.

However at the end of S1E9 I noticed a dialogue that takes place between a captured Jaime Lannister and the not-yet-proclaimed-King Robb that is *eerily similar* to the dialogue between Jon and Ramsey prior to the BoTB.

From IMBD: 

*Jaime Lannister* : We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons, and let's end this here and now. 

*Robb Stark* : If we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.

Now, this same (similar) exchange can be seen at the 'parley' between Ramsey and Jon. Where Jon challenges Ramsey to single combat and Ramsey gives in essence the same response, just replacing the 'kingslayer' remark with *bastard*. 

Unfortunately it seems due to Sansa's handiwork, Ramsey's ~~words are forgotten~~ quote isn't listed on IMBD.

Now IIRC in the books, Robb and Jaime don't have that exchange (I mainly remember Lord Karstark demanding they execute Jaime immediately for killing his sons). I just find it amusing the show-runners linked the dialogue together, I can't really imagine it's just coincidence; it just correlates too much.

I've been re-reading through the books for a 2nd time, and on Tuesday I got to the famous ""Red Wedding"" scene in ASOS. It was troubling the 2nd time through, having to relive the brutality (both of the book and TV versions in my head) and noticing a few more hints that Catelyn recognized but didn't act on, but I was able to put it out of my head and sleep well that night.

Well, on Thursday I was sitting at work listening to a random station on Google Music, and suddenly the Sigur Ros version of Rains of Castamere comes on. I had to stop everything and listen like the Maestro in Seinfeld. I was practically catatonic. I then listened to The National version like 10 times and memorized the lyrics, went back to Sigur Rose... rinse, repeat. It all came flooding back.

I can't stop thinking about it. It's been over 24 hours at this point. I can't get over the depth of mythology that GRRM developed for the Tywin backstory and the song itself, the brilliant function that song plays in the story, and how great the lyrics and music really are. Almost the entire song is about Lord Reynes talking a bunch of trash, and then at the end it just makes a passing reference to the fact that Tywin murdered everyone they new and burned down their castle. 

&gt;And who are you, the proud lord said,
that I must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat,
that's all the truth I know.
In a coat of gold or a coat of red,
a lion still has claws,
And mine are long and sharp, my lord,
as long and sharp as yours.
And so he spoke, and so he spoke,
that lord of Castamere,
But now the rains weep o'er his hall,
with no one there to hear.
Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,
and not a soul to hear.

We all know the Known World Map of Planetos is incomplete. And the end should be bittersweet...

So, this is what I imagine:

The war will continue and lead to the destruction of Kings Landing; The remaining forces will continue to march , but the fight will be over supplies; with all the war, and winter, the harvest was dismal.

A plague will spread; The White Walkers will pass the Wall, but Bran will help the Alliance of Ice and Fire to contain their advance. The connections between the Starks and the Long Night will be explored because it is the key to defeat the white walkers.

The Dragons will kill most of the wights, but more still will raise from the dead. It is like it will never ends. For some reason, the white walkers keep coming, no matter how many gets killed.

The reason is possibly, Euron Greyjoy. He is the one ""feeding"" the white walkers at this point. First was Craster, now it is Euron.

Euron either wants the Long Night, to become the Great Arbiter of who lives and who dies ; or he wants the white walkers not to be defeated by anyone- anyone except himself. In short: Euron either wants the Long Night, or he wants to defeat the white walkers himself and be worshiped as a God like figure by the survivals

Euron is collecting priests from many Religions , engaging in weird magic rituals and has an interest in dragons, who are magical creatures - a logical step would be go to the Isle of Faces at some point. 

And that is how Bran will find out Euron is"" feeding"" the White Walkers...

I imagine Bran, Jon and Dany will join forces and defeat Euron. The land, however, will have become wasteland.


And here is the bittersweet : a new beginning in a new Land. 

Samwell has discovered evidence of lands in the West of Westeros while in Oldtwon; a Maester also wrote a book on his experiences on the Lonely Light and how some skinchangers supposedly found this land of Always Summer.

They might even use the Last Dragon to scout this land; they conclude there is truth in the tales, and the survivors leave Westeros, the Magic and the Gods, behind.

Think of the moments you hate the most, where your favorite characters died.

Ned Stark. Oberyn Martell. The Red Wedding. Everything Ramsay does.

They have either been directly caused or enabled by Tywin Lannister. He's not the sadistic psycho Ramsay is, nor is he impending supernatural doom in the form of Euron, nor is he a white walker. In fact, he's worse than all of them.

The reason he's a bigger evil than any is the fact that Tywin is not a natural or ideological evil. He's a practical evil. Whereas Ramsay and Joffrey are sadists just for the heck of it and the white walkers are fundamentally at odds with humans due to their nature, Tywin does everything he does because he calculated that those actions will bring him benefit. He has the capacity and mind to tell good from evil, and yet he chooses evil because it serves him better. That's philosophically much more despicable than anything the aforementioned villains do.

And more on my first point, half the villains in the series are simply extensions of Tywin, his teachings and his doings. Cersei is a complete shadow of his father. Jaime (back in the first and second seasons) was still trying to prove his worth to Tywin. Joffrey was a weird combination of Tywin's ruthless scheming and Robert's incessant warmongering and disdain towards life while having neither the intelligence nor the strength and courage of either. The Mountain is a puppet of Tywin. Tywin was the enabling drive behind the red wedding and the Bolton's and Frey's coming to power.

Which all shows that even long after his death, Tywin still manages to be the continuing main villain in the series and every antagonist is more or less a remnant of the shadow and legacy of Tywin Lannister. Now, with Daenerys setting sail to Westeros and Euron poised to be the lovecraftian dragon-controlling eldritch pirate wizard king (if we are to trust the books on this issue), we maybe finally starting to move on from Tywin's influence after mid season 7 or even early season 8 (or whenever Cersei submits or dies) but damn did this guy put us through one hell of a ride.

TL;DR So far every main villain in the series has been a pawn of Tywin Lannister's plan and he still continues to be the primary antagonist of GoT even long after his death.

The rules are: (from asoiaf wiki)

&gt; The game must be played on some sort of bridge placed over water of some sort. One player, the Lord of the crossing,"" stands in the middle of the bridge with a staff. When another player approaches, the Lord of the crossing must say ""I am the Lord of the crossing, who goes there?"" The player who approaches must then present his reasons for crossing the bridge and why he should be allowed to cross. The Lord asks the player questions and makes them swear oaths. The player does not have to respond truthfully to the questions, **but the oaths are binding unless the player says ""Mayhaps"" quickly enough that the Lord does not notice**. Then the player must attempt to knock the Lord off the bridge. The Lord can knock a player into the water at any time, and he is the only one armed with a staff. Only when the Lord is displaced can another player become lord, but only if they said mayhaps in the game, otherwise it means immediate disqualification.

In the 3rd book (A Storm of Swords) when Robb and Catelyn arrive at the Twins for Edmures wedding, they speak with the Lord of the Crossing himself.

&gt; There's fires waiting for you, and hot mulled wine, and baths if you want 'em. Lothar, show our guests to their quarters.""

&gt; ""I need to see my men across the river, my lord,"" Robb said.

&gt; ""They shan't get lost,"" Lord Walder complained. ""They've crossed before, haven't they? When you came down from the North. **You wanted crossing, and I gave it, and you never said mayhaps, heh**! But suit yourself. Lead each man across by the hand if you like, it's naught to me.""

&gt; My Lord. Catelyn had almost forgotten. Some food would be most welcome. We have ridden many leagues in the rain. 

&gt; Walder Freys mouth moved in and out. ""Food, heh. A loaf of bread, a bite of cheese, **mayhaps a sausage**, heh?""

I was thinking about how when the person most believed to be Rhaegar dies in the battle (which takes place in a river/stream), the rubies in his armor are dislodged and scattered everywhere. If those rubies are required to keep this person looking like Rhaegar, one might assume that his appearance would revert to whoever it truly is.

There might be a few ways of explaining why this doesn't happen (including that not all of the rubies were dislodged from his armor), but I prefer this theory: Water prolongs the illusion.

This would be consistent with why Melisandre is able to bathe without her choker on.

Jaime then mentions how he thought about the death of Neds father/brother as he was killing the Mad King, and considered it justice of some sort. 

&gt; Is that what you tell yourself at night? Youre a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved you sword in Aerys Targaryens back?

&gt; Tell me. If I stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?

I always thought that when Jaime made that last remark about stabbing Aerys in the belly he was just being funny (or trying to be). But after thinking about it more, it was actually a very valid question from Jaime. And I feel stupid for not realizing that. 

At the first Tower of Joy flashback, we see Howland Reed save Ned by stabbing Ser Arthur Dayne in the back. Ned is visibly distraught by it. We even get a remark from Bran about the backstabbing. 

Before this scene it never really occurred to me that it isnt honorable to stab someone in the back during a fight. I feel very dumb now, because I suppose thats why its called backstabbing. So when Jaime makes the belly comment, I had an ohhh I get it now moment. 

Im sure that no matter how many times one rewatches Game of Thrones, they will always pick up on details previously missed. Its like an epic never-ending scavenger hunt, and I love that.",35,45,False,self,,,,,

- *Lost their trusted advisors Aemon, Seb Barristan Selmy.*

- *Jeor and Jorah influenced them a lot in the very beginning and mould them into a better person respectively.*

- *Both have connection to magical creatures a direwolf, three dragons.*

- *Fell in love what Westerosi and Essosi people consider savages Ygritte and Drogo. Essentially became a part of their culture.*

- *Both of them died in their arms and they felt responsible.*

- *They were forced into sleeping with but fell in love afterwards. Jon was undercover and Dany was sold.*

- *Dany's Mhysa moment in S03 E09 and Jon's Mhysa at the BotB.*

- *Their resurrections - one in Ice and other in Fire. Both naked and cinematography similiar.*

- *After their rebirth scene, each of them stood in front of wildlings and dothraki - who now considers them basically Gods.*

- *Shared Targaryen blood.*

- *Their mothers died in childbirth.*

- *Both of them received gifts as Valyrian steel sword and three dragon eggs.*

- *They refused easy way and to leave their places. Dany choose to rule instead of sailing towards  Westeros. Jon refuses offer from King Stannis to be Lord of Winterfell. Choose to be with the Night's Watch.*

- *Attempted assassinations on both of them... in around similiar time.*

- *Tried to change tradition and system that was established for centuries. Jon with view on wildlings vs Night's Watch and Dany with slavery.* Jon let wildlings through the Wall, Dany abolished slavery .

- *Proclaimed to be PTWP by Red Priestess.*

You can drop your army anywhere in the seven kingdoms but it has to happen right at the start of book one. You have all the knowledge you have today at your disposal. What do you do?

This is how I would change the world of Westeros. I'd drop my men at Winterfell to start out, raise white flags and camp inside the walls. I would talk to Ned, and using my knowledge of Jon and Lyanna get his trust. I'd explain the situation and what is to come of king Robert, and make him understand nothing can be done to stop it. Ideally Ned would be convinced to decline King Robert's invitation to hand of the king and stay at winterfell. I tell Ned to let no Stark leave winterfell and prepare for the long war to come. Jon doesn't take the black and Bran doesn't fall from the window. My men pack up and leave for Harrenhal, the castle we will overtake. All the southern lords are shocked to hear an army of 10,000 has just marched into Harrenhal but they do nothing about it, the kingdom is still at peace. Flash forward to Robert's death, Joffery takes the crown and four kings lay claim to the throne. Ned calls his banners to stop any Greyjoys from storming the North. 

We send ravens to Renly to ask he support Stannis, and Renly says no with the Tyrells behind him. Stannis kills him with Mel's semen demon, and Stannis gets his army. I meet with Stannis personally somewhere between Harrenhal and Dragonstone to make plans for Kings Landing siege. At the battle of Blackwater, Stannis sends a small chunk of his fleet forward to bait the Lannister's into destroying their fleet with wildfire. Once the blast has passed the rest of Stannis's fleet moves in and siege begins. However, since the Starks are not involved in the war, Tywin and his army have moved to defend the city before the battle begins. We move in from the west to lay siege and over a long course of time take the city. Cersei, Joffery, Jaime and Tyrion are all executed. As unfortunate as that is, Stannis would not have it any other way. If Tywin is still alive, he is sent back to Casterly Rock with the message Winter is coming. This may cause problems down the road but I won't kill my main man Tywin. The next problem is Dany in the east. 

Stannis begins massing a huge army with all the southern lords to prepare for the long night, and all but 500 of my men are sent to Winterfell to join with Ned. My 500 grab ships and head for Mereen, where Dany is about to set rule. This is where things get a bit tricky, because Dany will not jump on the idea of crossing the narrow sea to join behind western lords and fight the white walkers, she will want to upseat Stannis and ""break the wheel"". Best case scenario, she magically agrees to help out and packs three dragons to roll to the wall. Worst case scenario I am fed to a dragon. Most likely she will force me to leave and head back across the narrow sea. 

Once I return my men ride for the wall to talk with Lord Commander Mormont about Ned and Stannis and their armies that will help. They start to strengthen defenses while we ride North of the wall. We meet with Mance to try and negotiate, not to get the wildlings to join, but head as far south as possible so they can't be killed and join the army of the dead. If they don't cooperate, more bodies to kill, if they do, less bodies to kill. We ride back to Winterfell and prepare for the war to come.

Loose ends that don't add much to the story, just things I'd like to see. Give Sandor a new job to guard Sansa and Arya instead once Joffery dies. Marry Rob to Margery Tyrell. Personally ride against Gregor Clegane and destroy his band, personally behead him. Convince Stannis to banish Mel or kill her, no need for her messing with the king. And finally make sure no direwolf is killed for stupid reasons.

That's what I would do, what do you guys think. Would I have failed the Game of Thrones? Would I have done better than most? What would've went down? But mostly I want to hear what you would do with an army under the circumstances presented




Edit: I suppose I have to deal with Varys and Littlefinger. Littlefinger is going to lose his head at the sept of baelor. I will fund and support Varys in hopes he can either make Dany conform or destroy her. You want the best player in the game on your side.

GENDRY: Wherever he may be and in spite of his illegitimacy, he's the only alive person with King Bob's blood. 

DAENERYS: Baratheons are part Targaryens, so in the absence of any Baratheons, the throne falls upon the oldest male Targaryen. The male Targaryen is an illegitimate bastard, however.

JON: While he's a male Targaryen, he's illegitimate. Whether being a bastard or female excludes an heir's claim more, that I do not know.

Ideally I'd like for Jon to stay North following all that White Walker business - provided he survives it - and for Daenerys to take the throne.

However, following the Tower of Joy reveal, I can't see this being the case. I feel Jon's parentage must have some larger part to play.

That raises the question as to whether Rhaegar had ensured Jon would be born legitimate. Even so, how does everyone reckon this could this be proven w/o doubt to the Westerosi people? 

I've read somewhere about Ned having buried something in the crypts of Winterfell. I know Howland Reed was also present, but I can't imagine the word of one man being proof enough.

Sansa ""Bolton-Stark"" claiming her right to the rulership of Dreadfort. Looks a bit unlikely since she wants to distance herself from that phase of her life as much as possible and she is probably eyeing the seat in Winterfel, which would be more difficult if she settled for Dreadfort.

Creating a new house. Maybe House Giantsbane? Seems like the thing Jon would do out of respect to his friends, despite the problems associated with entrusting the command of a city to someone with no such experience.

Give it to Ser Davos. It's not even likely that he'd take it.

I know this song is a play off of Patchface's prophecies from the books. Although I'm going to focus on TV show speculation since I haven't read the books myself, I tagged this for open discussion so book predictions are totally fine as well.

Breaking down the song, I have a few guesses for interpretations:

* **It's always summer beneath the sea** - ??? Potentially referencing the unknown land beneath The Summer Sea or perhaps the land just south of The Dothraki Sea (home of the Red Women and the God of Light)? Not quite sure on this one
* **The birds have scales** - Previously thought this was a direct nod to Danny's Dragon's but now I'm pretty sure this is actually Jon Snow (a crow/bird) who's truly a Targaryen (dragon/scales)
* **and fish take wing** - Lysa Arryn being thrown from the moondoor. This also matches Balon Greyjoy being thrown from the bridge.
* **The rain is dry** - ???
* **and Snow falls up** - Jon Snow rising from his lowest point after leaving The Wall (or literally being raised from the dead)
* **The stones crack open** - ??? Danny's dragon eggs cracking open? The Citadel exploding? Maybe a prediction for the fall of The Wall?
* **The water burns** - Wildfire at The Battle of Blackwater
* **The shadows come to dance** - These are most likely The White Walkers. However, the Lord of Light also has some ties to shadows and darkness maybe there are things worse than White Walkers",9,21,False,self,,,,,

And who gets to give the vision? The new three eyed raven. Bran Stark.

We have seen that the statement ""past already written, the ink is dry"" is Bullcrap tbh. in the part when Bran shouting to his soon-to-be Father Ned in Tower of Joy. And he making the clusterfuck time-space continuum of Hodor. is a proof that Three eyed Raven CAN have impact in the past. through their vision.

i'm sorry man, i can't help but to meyakini this theory. i may not have a lot of Proof on this theory, but isn't it all make a perfect sense? ... i mean look at Rhaegar, he is a honourable prince who HAS MARRIED and HAD TWO CHILD, like whaaat? why did he jeopardsing his house aliances with the Southern Dorne? i meant he is honourable as fuck isn't he?

And the 'romantic' Lyanna Rhaegar theory is, idk i think they both just got to do their duty i think, by making a baby Jon Snow who is have a big impact with leading against the White Walker and the Others.

-Stannis will lose against the Boltons and die at Winterfell (George R. R. Martin about his Theon chapter from Winds of Winter: ''The chronology, as usual, is tricky. This chapter will be found eventually at the beginning of Winds, but as you will be able to tell from context, it actually takes place before some of chapters at the end of Dance.'' So it's before Jon's Pink Letter chapter.)

-Shireen will be burned by Melisandre at the Wall

-Barristan will die at the beginning of TWoW

-Myrcella and Tommen will die somehow (Because of the prophecy...)

-Mance will not survive being Ramsay's prisoner (Yes. Ramsay wrote the Pink Letter. Every other idea is bullshit. The fans complicated it too much.)

-Jon Snow will be resurrected, goes to Winterfell as he planned before the stabbing and become King in the North as a bastard

-Sansa will meet him only there. With Littlefinger and the army of the Vale of course. They'll save Jon and the wildlings and some northener houses.

-Manderly and Glover will survive the first battle of Winterfell where Stannis lose. They'll come back to Jon after his(and the Sansa's) victory

-Daenerys will get the dothraki army with Drogon. Tyrion will be her Hand. Of course because he is one head of the dragon too. They only need the King(Jon) after this. But the point is that Dany will leave Essos after she defeats the Maesters. Se breaks up with Daario. 

-Cersei will win in King's Landing with some wildfire action in the books too. There will be many deaths. (High Sparrow and Margaery will be on the death list for sure)

-Jaime will womehow return to King's Landing to Cersei

-Arya will kill Walder Frey

-Bran and Meera will leave the cave because the Others attack them. It would be nonsense if not. And Coldhands will return, because he have to. His identity need to be revealed. I think he is Benjen. I know GRRM told he is not, but i think he meant ''He is not Benjen anymore.''

-Hodor's dramatic death

-Sandor returns

Although the general basis for the theory isn't unique I think some of the evidence and ancillary info will be new territory. These are the cliff notes, but **[check out my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GLYla47Kc)** , it dives into a more extensive review. 
In a conversation between Arya and the high priest of the house of black and white known as the kindly man (or Jaqen Hghar in the tv show), we learn that the Faceless men originated in the slave pits of Old Valyria. He speaks of the slaves that worked in the Valyrian mines and the wickedness of their masters. Often the slaves would uncover magical creatures such as fire wyrms that would go on to wreak havoc amongst them making survival particularly volatile. It's from this that we learn of the origin of The Many Faced god and the origin of TFM. When Arya asks The Kindly Man why TFM were bestowing their ""gift"" to the slaves as opposed to the masters, he alludes to the fact that they did but it's a story for another time.

&gt;That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given."" Arya drew back from him. ""He killed the slave?"" That did not sound right. ""He should have killed the masters!"" ""He would bring the gift to them as well . . . but that is a tale for another day, one best shared with no one.""

So based on this, it would make sense that TFM had some role in bringing about the Doom of Valyria. How would they do this? Reddit user ShopeIV puts forth a theory that claims the FM learned how to weaponize dragon eggs. It is still uncertain in the history of ASOIAF, how exactly dragon eggs are hatched, but its claimed to be quite volatile. We do see Daenerys hatch her three, and its thought to be a combination of Fire and Blood that does the trick, but that is way oversimplifying it Im sure. Her intuition to step into the flames at the right time is typically cited. Lord Alester Florent, lord of dragonstone in Stannis Baratheons absence, quotes just a few of the tragedies that have befallen those who have attempted to hatch eggs. Were not going down the Summerhall rabbit hole in this video, but were working on a pretty cool Summerhall theory that will be released in the next few weeks. 

&gt;This talk of a stone dragon ... madness, I tell you, sheer madness. Did we learn nothing from Aerion Brightfire, from the nine mages, from the alchemists? Did we learn nothing from Summerhall? No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons.

In the prologue of AFFC we are introduced to Pate, a novice at the citadel who is drinking in a tavern.  He is approached by a man who calls himself an alchemist and attempts to bribe Pate to steal a skeleton key to the Citadel from his senile old maester.  Pate at first declines the offer but then decides to in order to afford the maidenhead of a girl he has a crush on. After the deal is struck Pate is believed to have died at the end of the prologue but not before pulling back the hood of the alchemist revealing a face that is described as being identical to the face Jaqen Hghar had assumed when leaving Arya.  What would he be looking for?  In a Dance with Dragons, Tyrion reflects about many tomes that are contained in the depths of the citadel.  Chiefly among these is A Death of Dragons which could easily detail ways to kill and perhaps even hatch dragons.  So.how the hell would the FM even get something as rare as a dragon egg?  Easily apparently.  Euron Greyjoy speaks to Victarion during A Feast of Crows about how he had come across a dragon egg but threw it into the sea in one of his darker moods.  This of course is Euron covering his tracks.  In reality, though it hasnt been explained explicitly, Euron used the dragon egg as payment to the FM in order to kill Balon (who was seen being killed in a vision by a man with no face) so that he could ascend the seastone chair. There is no set price for the FM to assassinate someone but rather their price depends upon what you have to offer as payment.  A dragon egg would definitely cover the killing of a king of the iron islands.

As a caveat to this theory, there is a separate theory that holds the FM as followers of The Great Other, the one who empowers the white walkers, basically the opposing force to Rhollor, the god Melissandre worships. There are some nice points being made about how the FM would love giving their masters gift to all living beings on Planetos, but that essentially turns them into a death cult and makes their arc a little lame.  Followers of the great other are not technically alive.  A wight would be described as the text book definition of undead.  Dead but still animated. This flies in the face of everything the FM stand for.  The great other perverts the gift that the FM impart upon those chosen by the many faced god.

- Ramsey fed Osha's body to his hounds.

- No one remaining alive and involved in Winterfell knows who she was or what she did for the Starks.

- The likelihood of Bran ever being able to find out what happened to her is almost impossibly slim, and it's unlikely the Umbers would recall her as important enough to remember anyway.

- Theon probably has the most possibility of indirectly figuring it out, but he's like, a fucking idiot, so yeah---Not gonna happen when he's got all this other stuff on his plate.

- Lord Bolton was poisoned by his enemies.

Purposeful or Coincidence?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/570v9t/everything_realized_something_about_baelishned_in/,PowerswitchHD,1476225623,"Near the end of the episode 5 (The Wolf and the Lion), after Ned ""quits"" as hand of the king, he is packing his bags to leave for Winterfell. During this time Petyr Baelish comes to visit and stops Ned from packing up. He tells him that he knew who Jon Arryn visited last before he fell ill, and that for Ned to speak with them as well would take less than an hour.  Baelish seemed particularly keen on Ned coming to visit this bastard child, despite her having no real importance in..anything, really. This is odd, seeing as Ned knew that he needed to leave before word of Tyrion's capture by Catelyn reached King's Landing. 

So, Ned acquiesces, and goes on a visit to LF's brothel. This gives Jaime time to assemble his soldiers that he then takes to confront Ned, maiming him and taking tensions between their houses higher than ever. I believe this was Baelish's plan (or at least his hope) from the beginning. It was him who orchestrated the dying of Jon Arryn in order to stir up conflict between the Starks and Lannisters, so ensuring that there is an even greater confrontation between Jaime and Ned would be in his best interest. 

Now at this point, it seems to be a shaky connection at best. But, following the ending of the episode, directly after Ned ks speared through the leg, the song that plays is an early variation of Baelish's theme. There have been examples before of the show playing music that gave ""hints"" before, it seems logical for that to have been done here. This hinges on assuming that Baelish knew about Tyrion's capture when he went to speak with Ned, but that doesn't seem too far fetched, considering Jaime found out and had time to assemble a group of soldiers in, presumably, an hour.",14,11,False,self,,,,,

I think she must learn how to fight no matter how big her army is or how many dragons she has, it's like Jon said to Ramsay, why your people should die for you if you are not willing to die for them. it's not that Daenerys won't agree in this with Jon, but she just doesn't have the skills to fight one on one... yet.

Let's think about this: One time Daario Naharis broke into her tent with her lots of guards not noticing. If Daario wanted, she'd be dead, she can't defend herself. What if she could, how cool would it be for the righteous queen of westeros be also an awesome warrior, maybe not as great as Jamie or the Hound, but she should be able to defend herself.

She definitely has people around her who could teach her: Greyworm, daario if she calls him back from Meereen, or even Jorah if he is not totally stoned by next season.

I think she's going to dedicate her life to undoing the Faceless order.

This thought came to me while rewatching S5/S6: any time she's told about the Faceless Men, their origin, their ideals, it's never as she expects, and you get the impression that she's not only disappointed with the order, but she also disagrees with them. You can't choose who you kill, you will be hired to kill good people, you'll push poison on sick people as a mercy (involuntary euthanasia?) but tell these afflicted that it's gonna cure them. Also, the way Arya storms out after putting the Waif's face in the hall of faces and confronting Jaqen. She was pretty clear about not wanting to be ""no one"" anymore. She considered Jaqen her friend, and she thought she could be his buddy and apprentice while being taught how to take revenge, but I can't imagine her referring to Jaqen as ""friend"" after how he let her go blind, get beaten with sticks, and sicked an assassin on her.

&amp;nbsp;

Arya obviously wants to be in control of who dies and who lives, and her affiliation with Faceless Men is very much in the past, but she can't just be free from her life with the Faceless. Remembering that Arya is a Stark, and considering what she *really* wants, try this:

(Loosely quoting Eddard): ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. A man who hides behind executioners soon forget the meaning of death.""

&amp;nbsp;
 
Isn't it possible that Arya will become an ***anti***-Faceless Man? Working towards erasing them from the world. Maybe she trains her own disciples, teaches them how to kill, and that they're free to kill whoever they want as long as they're killing for themselves, and not for other people.

After Arya takes her revenge on the people on her list, and thinks she can live a normal life, suddenly she fears for Jon and Sansa, because what if some farmer who rooted for the Boltons wanted the white wolf dead? If he only has 4 potatoes to his name, and he gave these potatoes, the faceless men would be compelled to take his contract. So to live in peace and free of fear, Arya decides to kill every faceless man in Planetos, and to create new killers who decide for themselves who live or die. She may start a war with Braavos, but she wouldn't be fighting it alone. In spite of Braavos being founded by freed slaves of Valyria, and Danaerys being on a freeing-spree, I think there's still bad blood between Targaryens and Braavos. If slavers are the scum of the earth in ASOIAF, what is a paid assassin order? Though it's more likely that we run out of time in the ASOIAF universe, a war with the Faceless seems inevitable. An order of assassins who doesn't distinguish between good and bad, innocent or guilty, can't be good for business no matter what empire you run.

&amp;nbsp;

It may be a little bit controversial, because people love the Faceless Men in general. Badass killers in disguises who don't feel pleasure/pain and is borderline omniscient. But I have a strong feeling that Arya will need to do something, either because she's being hunted, or because she want the world to be a place where good people beloved by many can end up dead because one sadistic person paid with all his gold and property, regardless of their position, support or drive.",6,7,False,self,,,,,

A lot people say there is some crazy game plan that the FM have against Westeros and Arya is the key but I think Arya getting recruited is much simpler than others make it out.
The FM have the ability to wear any face of anyone and become that person, in short they can use magic. As we know, magic has left the world since the death of dragons and only recently has been making an appearance since Dany hatched her brood. We also know from GRRM that all the Stark children are magical/warg in one way or another, meaning they can use and control magic. So in short, Arya can use magic thus meaning she can also wear and use faces like the FM. A rare gift for someone born into a magicless world.

When Arya gets to King's Landing, she meets Syrio the first sword of Braavos. He teaches her a lot of things that seem like something the FM would says, and some argue it's FM training 101. But Syrio is not Jaquen or even a FM. He's just a Braavosi who has been trained using the ideas of the FM. If a bronze coin and a phrase is all Arya needs to get from Westeros to Braavos, then the FM have a huge presence with the Braavosi. It would make sense that a group meant to fight (First Swords of Braavos) might use the philosophies of a well established and respected group as the foundation of their trainings. Which is why is lessons feel so much like what FM would say or do. ""There is only one god, and his name is death"" isn't a hint that Syrio is a FM but rather a glimpse into how much influence the FM have over Braavos. Ultimately, these lessons help Arya survive the rest of her life and prepare her for her life with the FM.

Arya's thoughts and actions on the road with the Night's Watch, working in Harrenhal, and lastly with the Hound are all about trying to be someone else. When first on the road with Jaquen, she is pretending to be a boy. He watches her attempt to wear her first ""face"" though he can see right through it. Jaquen makes this clear in the show that he knew all along that she was a girl but did not want to lead anyone else on to that. In the books Arya has a bit of a different experience than the shows, and it gives a glimpse into how hard Arya is trying to be someone she isn't. In the books, Arya's sense of self goes from being the mouse at Harrenhal, small and unnoticeable; the the ghost at Harrenhal when she uses her allotted three names; back to the mouse at Harrenhal when she has no more names left. In both the books and shows she picks new names for herself, attempts to create new histories for the people she's attempting to become and uses these identities to survive. Sounds like what the FM do.

All the while Jaquen is watching Arya, a girl who can use magic, is actively trying to be someone else always, with a strong will to survive. Arya has become an ideal candidate for FM training. Jaquen knows that she has people she wants dead, and he uses that to his advantage but in the end Arya does not go with him. Once Arya does come to the house of black and white, she must once again prove her willingness. Jaquen has seen first hand how stubborn Arya can be and is trying to wear her down which is why she spent so much time just waiting. After she enters, and begins her training with the Waif, Jaquen realizes the biggest issue Arya has is that she doesn't know at the core who she actually is. Remember, Arya has been spending YEARS being other people to survive, but how can you be no one or anyone if you don't know who you actually are. Being as stubborn as Arya is, she does not easily let go to the safety of being someone else and in the end becoming herself is what helps her graduate to full FM status.

In the scene where the Waif tells Jaquen that Arya is going to be killed he says ""So sad, a girl has many talents"". Like others, I do believe he is talking about the Waif, whose identity is too much in the FM to the point where she refers to herself as ""we"" as opposed to Arya who is always just ""me"". Just like Arya, the Waif can use magic as well which is why Jaquen is so sad to see her go. It's hard to recruit strong people with the ability to use magic, which is why very few are actual FM. Why Jaquen let Arya go is another question, and might be tied into FM training in a way we aren't aware. But either way, it was Walder Frey's time since he was like what, 100?

TL;DR: Arya was recruited by Jaquen to be a FM because she can use magic, is strong, and has a thirst for death. In a world where magic was gone for so long, Jaquen jumped on the chance to recruit a eager magical young women into the FM.",8,4,False,self,,,,,

The books handling of Arya and the faceless men is probably better but its still far from being panned out  Her chapters feel like theyre screaming wait for it but we're not there yet. Anyone feel like GRRM is kinda biding his time on Arya's story? Just got done with a series reread and she is easily one of the more focused on characters early. In the first 3 she probably has the most chapters out of anyone. But between feast and dance we've got like 5 chapters of content. I wouldn't be surprised if she was gonna be an exclusive Dance character but with Feast being a bit shorter and already suffering from lack of fan favorites, he threw half of those chapters in there. Obviously she's gonna leave Braavos at some point but how do you reckon we get there? What'll be different? Will she return to a more prominent role? Was not a fan of the step down in Arya chapters at all. I figure he's trying to iron out just how the defection from the faceless men is gonna go down",2,3,False,self,,,,,

Nevertheless she is just as manipulative and underhanded as Littlefinger and has arguably the strongest major house behind her. 
She is a player in the game of thrones by default due to her family, while Littlefinger had to work super hard to even get to the table.

To me Littlefinger represents social mobility, even though his methods are questionable, while Lady Olenna is using the same methods despite being born with privilege.

I see quite a few posts portraying Littlefinger as a clear Villain, while I don't really see the same for Lady Olenna.

He has admitted that he didn't know that the size he has used for the wall is too huge even in a fantasy novel.            
       
What we know is, ice from the poles in our world are melting. Water level is rising and Netherland might lose a lot of land mass. So what happens if the wall in Westeros collapses? The ice shouldn't just disappear.         
Actually in summer, the Wall would flood the Gift and the castles while the sun is burning on the wall. Then in the cold night the wall grows again. And this would happen repeatedly. (magic probably blocks this mechanism, so...)       
          
I know it is all magic and a fantasy explanation could just say, the wall is magic and the ice can not turn into water. But I like to think this through without the easy, it is magic explanation. And what would happen if the magic disappears and the wall collapses because of this, ice would turn into water. The effect on the world would also be interesting.       
       
It is said that Bran the builder has built the wall and it is not mention if and how much magic was involved. So Bran the builder might have built a huge ice cube shape and put all the water of planetos in it and let it freeze for decades. But this would also mean that the planet had a high water level previously.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Also, Theon especially mentioned that Jon would kill him when he would see him again. Sansa said that she will vouch for him.  

I think he needs to make a peace with this, because right now Jon basically =Robb in his mind and also Theon was in the show at least a bit nicer to Jon, sort of friend. Not in the books. 

Theon needs to face Jon and ask for forgivness. Only then he can be back to real Theon Greyjoy and his arc should be completed. Never to bertray Starks again and be loyal to them. That's his biggest crime, betraying Robb and Starks his surrogate family.",14,49,False,self,,,,,

In terms of writing and plot development, I think ""And Now his Watch is Ended"", episode four of season three, is the top.  
I was bored flipping through my OnDemand menu, and discovered that they had every episode of every season on there for free.  I picked S3E04, and it has to be my freaking favorite of them all.  
Jamie gets taken down a peg and  starts to bond with Brienne.  Gillie has the baby, and her escape plan from Craster's is hatched.  Speaking of Craster, he's killed in the same episode, moments before Lord Commander Mormont is taken out by his own brothers (much like his young protege will be seasons later).  Cersei turns down an alliance from Olenna Tyrell; a relationship that, had she fostered, could have been mutually beneficial and they'd both have living children.  We hear Varys's backstory as he relates it to Tyrion, and reveals he's got his mutilator stashed in a crate in his chambers (this actually kind of pissed me off, because it's never addressed again).  Theon really meets Ramsay for the first time, truly the beginning of something amazing. Daenerys frees the Unsullied with dragonfire and wrecks shit in Astapor, liberating Grey Worm and genuinely earning the loyalty of Missandei.

So many great relationships truly began in this episode.

Cersei agrees and the scene ends with the camera focused on cersei while she has that face on her where she is thinking along the lines of ''finally, I have control over my son.''

This was a great scene which has NO follow up.
It showed the two bonding which was great.

I am not sure if the "" Tower of Joy"" scene was one of the moments where Dave and Dan followed GRRM bullet points, it seems they changed the scenario a bit, but anyway, something struck me as odd. I know Ser Arthur Dayne was commanded to guard Lyanna from anyone. But it was Ned. Why was so important that nobody, not even Ned, would be able to see Lyanna?

The setting:

Lyanna is in Dorne, staying at this isolated tower, being guarded by Ser Arthur Dayne, Rhaegars best friend, who also happens to come from Dorne and to be the carrier of Dawn, which is literally Lightbringer. His sister, Ashara Dayne, is also nearby, and people like Ser Barristan Selmy assumed Ashara was "" dishonered"" at Harrenhal.

Rhaegar did not believe he would lose at the Trident. His wife and children are in KL; somehow, Rhaegar does not insist with Aerys that his family should be shipped off to Sunspear; that is how sure he was he would defeat Robert.

However, Lyanna...she is there, hidden. Nobody knew about her for months, not to mention of her pregnancy. 

We know Rhaegar was obsessed with the Prophecy. Elia could not have more children, which is a problem. What if Rhaegar and Elia had a plan? What if the presence of Ser Arthur Dayne, the fact that his sister, Ashara, has also not be seens for months and is rumoured to be pregnant, and the fact that Lyanna Stark is in Dorne, what if nothing is a coincidence, but it is exactly the plan?

Lyanna has the child, Ser Arthur brings the child to be raised as a bastard of House Dayne, supossedly birthed by Ashara; no problems if Ashara was in fact pregnant, they could have said she had twins. Years pass, Rhaegar is King and has the power to legitimize bastards, so "" Jon Sand"" becomes "" Jon Dayne"" by royal decree, joins the Knightsguard and upon Ser Arthur Daynes death, is deemed worthy of Dawn?

In a story like this, where half the main characters are busy trying to make prophecies come true, without realizing that it does not depend upon them, but on the circunstances, I think it makes sense. 

Now I take off my tinfoil hat...

Theons theme makes what I think must be an important appearance in one of Jons scenes.

Just as a refresher, here is Theons theme from his [baptism scene](https://youtu.be/kOAZYjTJ1Ms?t=1m2s)

Now here it is again as he [beheads Ser Rotrik](https://youtu.be/KfAUgtGy9zU?t=5m25s). Much more intense this time, and even more so as the scene goes on. The music really seems to be screaming I dont want to do this but I have to.""

Ramon Djawadi is very careful and specific when it comes to character themes, so I was a little surprised to hear Theons theme playing when [Jon beheads Janos Slynt](https://youtu.be/KkU1VW5ODE4?t=3m23s), but I think he is purposefully comparing these two scenes. Notice that instead of intensifying, this time the music **stops** just as Jon drops his sword to allow Janos to speak. When he makes the swing its in one fell swoop, not the weak indecisive action of Theon. Jon is strong, decisive. He executes his traitor in a determined silence. 

Is this comparison hinting at something in the future reuniting of Theon and Jon?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

Ideally, you would draft characters into positions like in fantasy sports.  So, an 8-team draft would feature positions like this:  

Daenerys Character slot  

North/Vale/Wall Character slot  

Major CRDR Character slot  

Minor CRDR Character slot  

Flex slot (for all the leftover characters).  


If a character's scoring is in any way unclear at any point in the season, I suggest that their fate be put to a vote if it can be done in an unbiased way.  There should probably be 100% agreement that it can be done without bias before the vote occurs.  If there can't be an agreement reached, then I suggest the entire player be scratched (given a 0 for the season, not including any previously accumulated points), unless the issue gets resolved by a later episode in the season.
New characters, for scoring reasons, need to be categorized.  I recommend voting in this matter as well, but keeping in mind that their category (and any scores already applied) be changed if their character falls into a different category in later episodes.    
An interesting optional component to add would be to put new and undrafted characters onto waivers to be picked up at any point in the season.  Dropped characters should not have any accumulated points negated.    

So what do you guys think?  


EDIT:  I used cinematic impact, rather than plot relevancy, as my method to categorize characters as major or minor characters ( I explain why in a comment).  I also changed vying for ""the crown"" to for vying for ""a crown"".  I did this because I think vying to be king/queen of the north puts you in a decent amount of danger so Bran, Sansa, and Jon needed to be +3/-3 kill/die scorers.  I also switched Meera Reed and the Mountain to major characters for the purpose of symmetry.  
  

EDIT 2:  Euron is actually vying for the crown and would be a +3/-3 kill/die scorer, despite him being a minor character.    

EDIT 3:  Formatting.

If any of these are violated, then it will be ""bad writing"" because ""It'll be too much like a standard fantasy/fairy tale ending and George R.R.

&gt; You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
&gt;  No. Who's he? Just a cook in the Night's Watch.
&gt; He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember.
When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.
That night he served the pie to the king.
He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice.
The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young.
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies.
But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.
If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-- It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie.
He killed a guest beneath his roof.
That's something the gods can't forgive.

**Castles**
The Rat Cook lived in the Nightfort, which is one of the abandoned castles along the wall. Hot Pie lived in King's Landing, which may also become abandoned at the end of the series.

**Hot Pie meeting Arya**
When Hot Pie first meets Arya, he threatens her and tells her he has killed someone before. While Arya apparently exposes Hot Pie and does not believe him, Hot Pie is in fact telling the truth. He had been a ruthless sociopath, but upon meeting Arya, he saw a darkness in her (the same kind that Melisandre sees later on). He realizes that he can manipulate Arya. So, slowly across the next few seasons he plays the innocent card and gets Arya to be his friend.

**The Wolf Bread** When the BWB captures the trio of Gendry, Arya, and Hot Pie, they actually know who each three are, maybe not Gendry, and their backgrounds. The Red Preist, Thoros of Myr, sees something in Hot Pie and thinks it is best to keep him along for the wars to come. Before she departs, Hot Pie cooks a wolf bread for Arya. This bread, though, actually had instructions on how to make the same sort of pie that the Rat Cook did in legend. Arya thwarted his plans though by actually eating the bread. However, when Hot Pie manages to deliver the second bread to Arya. She realizes that the bread, perfectly made, is actually more than just food. She rips it open to find the encoded message telling her how to make Arya's Frey Pie.

**Hot Pie's End Game** Clearly, Hot Pie and Jaqen H'gar had interacted quite frequently at Harrenhal, and far before. Hot Pie is using Jaqen to train Arya to get her to become his assassin. With the Frey's gone and no longer in control of the Riverlands, he will likely marry one of the Frey girls and seize the Riverlands for himself.

**Conclusion** In conclusion, Hot Pie is actually the reincarnation of the Rat Cook. The Rat Cook, learning from his mistake and hungry for power, becomes a lowly peasant and slowly works himself up, ala Littlefinger. Evidently, GRRM named him Hot Pie for a reason. Chekhov's gun is a dramatic principle that every memorable element in a fictional story must be necessary and irreplaceable, hence, Hot Pie serves a far greater purpose than most think.

**TLDR** Hot Pie is the reincarnation of the legendary Rat Cook. He used Arya to seize power of the Riverlands, and is plotting his ascension to the Iron Throne.",25,22,False,self,,,,,

Those that I've been able to convince that dragons can change gender as needed (though they are inferred to be male on the show) and could breed contend that they're brothers and descended from the old Targaryen line of dragons, so within a couple of generations would be as weak and inbred as the old ones that died out.

So have we gotten any ideas that the dragon eggs came from the Targaryen line, or is that just inference? I remember when she received them, they were supposed to be decorative and ""turned to stone"" and to have come from the Shadowlands of Assai. To me that implies that they could all have been laid by different dragons, and that they're all unrelated to the ""original"" Targaryen lines. 

Is Drogon larger simply due to genetic variation, or not being locked up and able to forage freely?

Do you think there more dragons out there than Daenerys'?

Ned and Jon's conversation before Jon left for the wall (""you may not have my name but you have my blood""), Ned's reaction when King Robert asked him about Jon's mother, the rat cook story foreshadowing Arya/Walder Frey's meeting.

EDIT: Lots of interesting answers here. Haven't noticed a lot of these. Third viewing imminent.

So cool that the Rat Cook story is mentioned by so many of you. I don't know if it was in the books (only halfway through aCoK) but that has become one of my favourite scenes in the show. On first viewing it was a slightly silly story that hinted that Frey would get his comeuppance (killing guests under his roof), on second viewing you realise they were literally describing his death.

Delicious.

I know, I know I'm awful and apologies if this was already posted since we're all in withdrawal (Also, Arya+Gendry scenes are now my 3rd favorite GoT scenes to re-watch)

So, on learning that Gendry wants to stay with the brotherhood mentioning he's never had a family, Arya emotionally pleads with him to leave with her and exclaims that she can be his family. His response is, ""you wouldn't be my family. You'd be my lady."" 
Now, after the miles of *swoon* I traveled, I started thinking wait did he really mean that? Why wouldn't he have proposed for them to stay with the brotherhood if that's what his intentions are with her.

OR, and this is where Ship meets mild Tin foil - he's cool with letting her go because he knows she's determined and will somehow find a way back to him. And he knows she has a lot of growing up to do. This also puts them in prime position to be a super important pair in the fight against the Others because if anyone can convince Gendry to do some dangerous shit to forge Valyrian steel, it's Arya, and she'll absolutely want to help thanks to Jon. 
Anywho, I'll stop rambling. What do you guys think? I'm pretty sure we're seeing a Gendry/Arya reunion in S7, but what's the nature of the reunion? Think they'll instantly click again? Will he tease her about totally not going the 'Lady' route that he teased her about when he first found out she's a girl? Will she help convince him that his master skills are needed?

But I promise to chuckle if I see it in the comments.

So for years the prevailing theory on Cleganebowl was that it would occur during Cersei's trial by combat. As shown in S6, the trial by combat (or any trial for that matter) never occurred for reasons involving exploding septs. 

However, I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the heart of the theory was the fight itself, regardless of the setting. Just because the trial did not happen does not mean the bowl will not happen.

That being said, I feel the battle of the brothers is one of the most important storylines. Think about it. Sandor has been around since the very first episode, Gregor since episode 4. They have BOTH survived assumed deaths and 6 whole seasons of the deadliest show on television. They would not have spent so much time and effort on resurrecting both Cleganes if not to serve some greater purpose. Jon was resurrected and already became KITN. So The Cleganes must serve some equally important purpose to continue on in the story. 

My theory is that Gregor is now uniquely susceptible to the control of the night king.  When the white walkers eventually come, I envision a scene where Qyburn (who seems to be Gregors true master) loses control of him and is killed. Somewhat fitting for a man to know so much of life and death. Since Gregor is now essentially a somewhat sentient wight, he may be susceptible to fire. And who would be more fitting than Sandor, a man who has hated Gregor all his life and has a famous fear of fire, to end his monstrous brothers rampage. It would be a fitting and appropriately important conclusion to both their character arcs. Yet another song of ice and fire to end the series. I imagine it'll take place among the last episodes of season 8.

I always found it a bit strange how Stannis Baratheon, a man who seems to be very down to earth, quite skeptical and with a strong sense of justice, would get the idea to welcome a sorceress into his castle on a whim. We all know Melisandre claimed Stannis was the chosen one/Azor Ahai, but would such a statement really be the only thing to make her earn such an influential position? We all know she drank poison unharmed and showed Stannis visions in the flames, but that was after she had gotten herself quite high up in his personal rankings. Some might think he just wanted more heirs or wanted her because she is attractive, but in the books Stannis is really uncomfortable around women and rarely even make love to his wife, so I don't think that's how it started despite him having sex with Melisandre later. We don't really know why or how she was invited to Dragonstone in the first place.

I believe Melisandre was the one who cured Shireen from greyscale, and therefore she also earned Stannis and Selyses trust and gratitude. For such a skilled magic-user as herself it couldn't be all that hard, and she would definitely do it if it meant getting closer to Stannis whom she assumed was the lord of light's chosen champion.

Sansa is very sisterly towards Jane, far more so than her actual sister, but she is also never like to forget that Jane is lower than her in social heirarchy, having more than one internal thought about how Jaune's opinions on this or that knight are silly because she's ""Only a steward's daughter"" (as I said, total bitch back then) but overall prefering her company to Arya's. 
Now that Jane is ""Arya"" and we have reason from the show that will make a reasonable assumption that, before the end of the series, Sansa will be at Winterfell AND will be acting a bit more littlefinger in the books than she does in show, has made me have a very, very dark but also plausable idea.

If Arya is going to be off playing No-one, she will likely never return and Sansa still thinks she is dead. So when Sansa meets the broken, beaten, tortured Jane who thinks she's got to pretend to be Arya, Sansa will NOT reveal the truth, but will instead seize on this chance, Play along and in private convince/force the broken Jane to keep being Arya so that she can have the sister she always wanted. While the real Arya stark is no-one, her place is taken by Jane Poole, who will live and die as Arya Stark, supported and loved by her dear, sweet sister, the lady of winter, so kind to look after her following her treatment at the hands of the Boltons.",12,3,False,self,,,,,

For me, I always wished to see Rob Stark fight. More specifically, against Theon after he hears of Theon taking Winterfell. Theon was very cocky in the beginning of the season, and Jon describes Rob as being better than himself. I see why it wouldn't have worked with how the plot was going, but it would've been great.

I wish we saw a little more from Khal Drogo as well, his one fight scene was badass. But it was short. I wanted to see him use his knives and show his wrath that he always had in his speeches. 

I always had a love/hate feeling towards Ramsay Bolton. But in the episode where Yara goes to save Reek and we see Ramsay with his shirt off and IIRC he's holding his sword. My point is he looks like a badass, a crazy badass who had some potential other than with a bow. I wish he actually fought Jon at the end of BoB and maybe Jon disarms him so that he could still be killed by Sansa. 

Lastly is the fight between Ned and Jamie. I wished to see how that fight would have played out. I also wish we saw more fighting from Jamie before his hand was cut off. He always was very confident, maybe too confident and it leaves me to wonder. From that battle we see how good Ned still is, and before he gets betrayed by Petyr I was ready for him to take on like 5+ guards and be successful, but it didn't happen.

The issue I see is in Jon's hair color. his hair is black and it is genetically impossible for a fair haired person (Targaryen) and a brown haired person (Stark) to have a child ""Black of Hair"". This led me to believe it could be 2 different options (if there are any others let me know).

1.) Jon is the son of Robert for he might have raped her (Lyanna Stark) before she was abducted/ran away. Robert might have done this because of the event where she was give the blue roses by Rhaegar Targaryen making him jealous and angry. After this Rhaegar took Lyanna into his care to protect her from the likes of Robert for Rhaegar was a kind man. Robert used this to fuel his rebellion for he was thirsty for battle. 
When Ned Came to Lyanna in the tower, it could be that she didn't want Robert to know the child was his so it wouldn't be raised by the war hungry rapist she came to know. So Ned promised to keep it a secret and raise the child as his own for the love for his sister and his friend Robert.

2.) Jon Snow is the son of Ser Arthur Dayne, The Sword of the Morning. After the capture of Lyanna, she was put in the capital as a guest and guarded by the kings guard. Rhaegar had a wife and was a good man and did not lay with her. But at this time, she may have fallen in love with Arthur who may have been her guard while she was there. It was then the slept together and Lyanna became pregnant. Here is where I'm not sure that they were then sent away by the Rhaegar Targaryen for their protection from Robert's wrath, or if they ran away together. I think that when the news of Rhaegar's death at the Trident came, they chose to flee from Robert and the Mad King.
They made their way to the Tower of Joy where they were later found by Ned and his men. Arthur was not about to give up his love to the side that she feared most and wanted his son far from it, so he fought, and lost (When Arthur dies, you hear a scream from the tower. Possibly in sadness over the lose of her beloved?) .Lyanna didn't want Robert to kill her child so she asked Ned to promise to not tell him. Because Ned Loved his sister, he took Jon snow in as his own.

Both of these theories are supported by genetic evidence in their hair color.  If either of these theories are already disproved then I'd like to know about it.

So I was just wondering if there are any theories/if it was ""fact"" that Arya is now an actual Faceless Man and on a job in Westeros, and that she is just playing Arya for said part.

Like she was given a mission, probably told all about what's going on in the World and how she can either save/end the World depending on what the Faceless Men want as a goal.  So she was given a task that only Arya can do, maybe in relations to getting close to Jon since they hate fire magic and he was just brought back with said magic, or something to do with the dragons.  But she is still now an actual Faceless Man and is ""No One"".

I just thought it was weird in her response to say ""A girl is"" and not ""I am"" seeing that as soon as ""No One"" said she was Arya Stark she says ""and I am going home"" and not ""and she is going home"".

I personally don't think it is very likely. I watched the KitN scene couple of times everytime I get the feeling Sansa's smile and happiness is geniune and her face changes when she sees LF glaring, probably becuase she knows what he is capable of. It feels more like a concern for Jon and the new stability of the North rather than a grudge against Jon. She knows only a fool would trust LF as she said and again as she said very plainly she trusts Jon and considering what Jon did for her, their home and their family and the fact he was very forgiving on Sansa intrigue regarding the Knights of the Vale, I don't see a betrayal coming.

These are characters you love to hate. I'm talking about either a poorly written character, a character that other people like and shouldn't or a character that just rubs you the wrong way.

For me it's Cersei Lannister. George wrote her character well and the way she is portrayed is even better. What pisses me off is the people who don't understand her character and hail her as a great player in the game of thrones. She is clearly not, George makes that clear. The only power she has is her last name and her father's money. Once my boy Tywin dies she loses alliances, makes a terrible series of decisions that lands her in a religious nut's dungeon and Kevan has to step in to clean up her disaster. Yet people everywhere hail her as a strong female character and a great player in the game. The point of her character is she has all the resources available to play the game but is too selfish and ignorant to make it happen. For god's sake she nuked a section of her city just to power play and drove the kingdom into the ground, stop calling her a strong character.

Here is the tale:
http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bael_the_Bard

Now, this tale is basically all about a wildling King infiltrating Winterfell under the guise of a Bard, and then steals away with Lord Starks daughter and they have a son who becomes the new Lord Stark when the old one dies. While Lord Stark was looking for Bael and his stolen daughter, all the while they were hiding in the crypts, right under the nose of Lord Stark. Now I see this as brilliant storytelling and foreshadowing. A bard (Rhaegar) steals away with the young maiden daughter (Lyanna Stark) of Lord Stark (Rickard) and they have a son who becomes the new Lord Stark (Jon). Now although R+L=J isn't perfectly confirmed in the books, we're all pretty sure it's true. This means, at least IMO, that Jon will hopefully become Lord Stark IF he actually comes back in the books. 

There are also things from the tale that haven't come to pass that I'm curious about. The son of Bael and Lady Stark eventually cross swords years later and Lord Stark kills his father which causes his mother to commit suicide. What does this mean, if it means anything, for Jon? Also, the crypts of Winterfell. Obviously Jon's parents are dead, so what would be the significance of the Crypts to Jon? This all may very well just be filler but hey, who knows? What are your thoughts? Any other foreshadowing you want to comment on?

tl;dr- A story Ygritte tells Jon may point to his true lineage and possibly what will happen to him in the future.",14,11,False,self,,,,,

I've never understood why those next few months were so important for creating a Lannister dynasty. What was Tywin working towards? He wasn't trying to claim the Throne for himself or put a Lannister on it (and he didn't seem to believe the ""rumors"" about his grandson). Was it ultimately to be the rulers of the kingdom through being Hand and using marriages to establish power? Is that really creating a Lannister dynasty?

*Built by Honor and Duty and are very good people but usually betrayed because of being blindsided by goodness.

Serpent Clan = House Lannister
*Full of deceit and are betrayers and expert with combat, they also have treacherous heroes such as Budo which is a slave driver.

Wolf Clan = House Targaryen
*Yes the dragon clan has a dragon but the point of getting beat down by other houses and almost went extinct and then rose up from ashes, I think their wolves and spirits = targaryen and their dragons.

Lotus Clan = House Baratheon ft. Melisandre
*Dark Magic and Sacrifices and is one of the most OP houses, back when Stannis is on his way to the Blackwater war I think without Tywin and Tyrion they've conquered King's Landing with ease.

So I thought this theory up after seeing the post about Season 7 filming where Ser Davos and Tyrion were spotted and apparently Gendry (we knew this though from that picture of him at the airport)

The post claims he is seen returning to Dragonstone. Which is odd because we last saw him fleeing there with the help of Ser Davos to save him from Mellisandre, so why would he return and risk his life? Well in the scene where he escapes Davos encourages him to head back to Kings Landing as no one knows his face and it's safer than a sealed fate.

Which means he's presumably been laying low as a smith in Kings Landing ever since. So why would he go back? Well it's no secret Stannis the Mannis was defeated at Winterfell. Maybe he's looking to make some sort of claim for Dragonstone? It's possible but seems out of character, my guess is Gendry has fled Kings Landing in fear of Queen Cersei. Not only has she just slaughtered hundreds but winter is coming and she's not going to be too worried about the citizens health and hunger, knowing Cersei. (Especially if he's in flea bottom) 

So my bet is Gendry is looking to meet with Davos for help and guidance on what to do or where to go. Davos is one of the few people who genuinely cared for him and helped him so it seems like he would seek him out. 

It's not the most exciting theory but it would be the start of his story and explain his return. Where it would spiral off from there is another question. A claim to Dragonstone? The throne? Who knows...",23,4,False,self,,,,,

I did search first, so forgive me if I missed something. This is also my first time posting a theory. It could be nothing, but I was re-watching season 2 and a conversation between Tyrion and Cersei caught my attention. It was in Episode 6, ""The Old Gods And The New"", when Marcella is shipped away to Dorne. Cersei tells Tyrion this:

""One day I pray you love someone.
I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face.
I want that for you.
I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone.
Before I take her from you.""

I don't think this was a foreshadow of Shae, but possibly Daenerys. Tyrion truly cares for her, not in a romantic way, but loves and believes in her in a way he never has for anyone or anything. I would hope Cersei wouldn't be the one to kill Dany, but after hearing that statement I couldn't help but ponder the idea. I am not in any way certain, but this show has a way of foreshadowing with words similar to this, so I thought I would share and see if anyone has any thoughts.",19,2,False,self,,,,,

But they won't stand a chance without the support of the entire realm. Queen Cercei refuses to unite with them (obviously). Jon and Daenerys then invade Kings Landing to take control of the throne and therefore the rest of the armies of the Seven Kingdoms. However Cercei is about to ""Burn them all"" when the city comes under attack. At this point Jamie fulfils the Valonqar prophecy and kills Cercei to stop her slaughtering hundreds of thousands of innocents. Jamie then gains control and unites the rest of the Seven Kingdoms with Jon and Daenerys, becoming the third head of the dragon. The united forces of Westeros then marches against the White Walkers for one last stand.

So on a recent rewatch with my SO (her first time) we just got to S6E5 : The Door and wow. Just wow. I can't get over how badly Bran fucked shit up. Before I had finished S6 a couple of months ago and spent some time on here I was pretty tired of his storyline towards the end of S4. But after my first rewatch I realized how important he was and I was way more interested.   
  
So it all starts with him being too impatient to train with the Three Eyed Raven. I get it Bran, you're crippled. Your life sucks. You're living in a cave. You're being fed awesome flashbacks 10 minutes at a time by a tree. But Seven Hells!   

Bran tries to flashback by himself because he's an impatient little bitch and in the process does the following:  

* Gets seen and marked by the Night King, allowing their army to not only track him but pass through the protected doorway to the cave under the Three Eyed Raven's Weirwood tree.
* Because of this the White Walkers and their army kill the last of the Children of the Forest, the oldest living inhabitants of Westeros.
* The White Walkers kill the Three Eyed Raven, before Bran is even close to being ready to take over for him.  
* Summer dies, leaving only Ghost and Nymeria.
* While already in the past, Bran wargs into Wyllis to control Hodor in the present, glitching him out and in the process creating Hodor decades ago, before Bran was even fucking born.  
* After taking control of past Wyllis to control present Hodor, Bran has to sacrifice Hodor to save him and Meera.  
* Because of the mark of the Night King (who now knows where he is at all times), he will probably fuck up the magic or whatever is protecting the wall, allowing their entire army to cross south of the wall.

It's the scene with the boats and Dany and her trustees on the one boat when the Tyrell and Martell boats come to join them in their travels. 

- How did the Tyrell &amp; Martell warships get to Dany so fast? Olenna was with the sand snakes, so she could have sailed there, but then how did the sand snakes know that fleet wasn't there to take over drone and kick them out? Does that mean that Olenna is on the ships and about to hang out with Dany? 

- and about the sand snakes; How come they can rule over Dorne with Oberyns mistress/lover/soulmate? And why are none of the other bastards rising up saying, umm hey I'd like to be ruler of Dorne? 

- How did Dany know the T&amp;M ships were coming to help her if they met on the sea? It just looks like a bunch of navy ships are on their way to her. 

-How did the T&amp;M warships even know where to find Dany?

1420,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-10-21,2016,10,21,1,58hpwv,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] Interesting Possibility Regarding who was Behind Bran's Attempted Assisnation,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/58hpwv/everything_interesting_possibility_regarding_who/,TheGoobCow,1476980129,"I was thinking recently about Bran's involvement in the conclusion of a song of ice and fire. 

There is an unpopular theory I've seen discussed that Bran is the cause of Westeros's current state. He is responsible through his influencing some major past events as the three-eyed raven. This includes events such as the building of the wall, Aerys's ""Burn them all"" moment, and more. 

Is the theory feasible? Well, it has been clearly shown that Bran can influence the past. We have circumstantial evidence of him making his father turn around, and more direct evidence of him ""creating"" Hodor. We also know that there are no paradoxes is ASOIAF's version of time travel because everything that happened has already happened. Bran always was the reason Willis became Hodor. There is no scenario where Willis lives a normal life up until the point Bran causes him to become Hodor, at which point, Willis immediately becomes Hodor as this would be a paradox. Bran's influencing of the past is has already happened, ""the ink is dry"", and it cannot be changed.

So, let's say that at first, Bran uses his powers to try to save Westeros by influencing past events. Eventually he realizes that his attempts to save Westeros are essentially causing Westeros to be in it's current state to begin with. Then a miraculous moment occurs - maybe it's the most important moment in the universe in which ASOIAF exists. The fate of Westeros and the entire universe rests upon what Bran decides to do in that moment. He essentially has two options (described below). It is a single point in time that has the possibility to break the stable time loop and, by doing so, change the present. 

 &gt; As an aside, this does indeed break the rules of a stable time loop. However, breaking the rules set in place in the universe of Westeros isn't necessarily out of place. It's already happened once: GRRM described Daenerys's birthing of the dragons while not herself being burned alive a one-time only miracle (in the books, Dany is not immune to fire, but still lives through the burning pyre that hatches her eggs).

Bran has two options: (1) continue to hopelessly change the past which creates the current present condition of Westeros, or (2) decide to stop, breaking the time loop. Through some method or storytelling device, he is aware of the implications of each option.

With option 1, all of the misery and death that Bran and the viewer has witnessed goes away. He is snapped back to Winterfell, living with his family happily. His dad never dies. His brothers never die. King Robert never visits. He's never pushed from the window, so he can walk. Perhaps Jon Snow is never born either, and Targaryens are still ruling Westeros peacefully. If Bran chooses this option, he becomes blissfully unaware of all of the things he and his family had experienced up until the point where Bran changed things, and he's even unaware of the fact that he made this decision. One could even imagine a line about Bran being upset that Jon Snow was never born, and some unknown character reassuring Bran by saying ""Would you miss a brother you never knew you had?"" The drawback to the option 1 reality, however, is that Bran isn't able to do the things he needed to do to stop the White Walkers. Everything he had done were carefully planned out steps to ensure the defeat of the White Walkers. When Bran breaks the time loop, his job isn't finished. Whatever it is that was to save Westeros from the White Walkers doesn't happen. The option is appealing to Bran: the White Walkers take over Westeros, but not until after Bran gets to spend years, or possibly a full lifetime, with his family, completely unaware of the impending doom.

With option 2, he decides to sacrifice his potential for a fulfilling life with his family and being able to walk again in order to do what he has always done: follow the ""the ink is already dried"" path in which Bran influence the past in a way that ultimately leads to the White Walkers destruction.

**So...** What does this have to do with the post title? When thinking about things that have happened in ASOIAF that significantly changed the course of history, assuming Bran goes with option 2, one of the biggest moments that comes to mind is the attempted assassination attempt on Bran. The person who ordered the attempt remains somewhat of a mystery. Jamie and Cersei believe it was Joffrey in an attempt to impress his father. But that's not conclusive, and it's possible that even Joffrey is smart enough not to use a unique dagger in a covert assassination attempt.

So what if Bran is responsible for his own assassination attempt? He knows the War of the Five Kings need to happen and that this event essentially triggers it. So, Bran influences a mentally unstable low class citizen of Winterfell to kill crippled Bran in his bed. Bran whispers to this man for weeks, months, or even years with the specific date and time of the attempt. He reassures the man that no one will be there and he will never be caught (a lie). He builds up a grandiose narrative for the man making him believe that, by assassinating Bran, he will save the world from certain destruction and will be rewarded as a savior. So, the poor man from Winterfell follows through with the plot. As instructed by Bran, he steals the dagger, starts the library fire, and then goes to kill Bran.

First of all, how did he get to this room? Surely there are numerous guards between where Bran is and where the man infiltrates from. I doubt every guard would have run straight for the fire in the library. Well, as mentioned in the story, nobody knows all the nooks and crannies of Winterfell like Bran. He knows every brick, wall, and secret passage and tunnel of the castle. 

Then, on the show at least, when he enters the room Bran is in, he says ""you weren't supposed to be here. Nobody's supposed to be here."" Why would he say that? Obviously, if Joffrey told him that the fire would distract everyone, he might say that out of surprise. But why would Joffrey or anyone else expect that Catalyn would leave Bran's bed-side. Again, what if the man says this because he's been convinced by years of whispers from that no one will be there, and he will be successful. He's shocked that everything he had been told about up until this point has come true, and suddenly, there's an ""irregularity"", if you will, between what he's been told and what is happening. 

You'll also notice (in the show) that once he sees Catalyn, he still goes directly towards Bran, as if he's convinced that killing Bran is of the utmost importance. You would think a hired assassin, even a slow one, would have bailed before even entering the room after seeing that Catalyn was in their, and would wait for another time. But nope, he enters anyways like this is something he HAS to do, he speaks his shock that someone else is there, composes himself, and then goes right for Bran.

So that's it. Of course, all of this is not strongly supported by the books, but that doesn't mean there cannot be plot twists that aren't supported by earlier evidence so long as they don't completely contradict evidence already presented. You could say that Hodor's significance is that it shows that Bran can and does change the past. This theory also relies on not believing that Joffrey was behind the assassination attempt (of which there is some evidence that we was, but it is inconclusive).

**TL;DR:** As part of destiny fulfillment that leads to the destruction of the White Walkers, Bran coordinates his own assassination attempt by influencing past events. Now, if you haven't already, go to the top and read my explanation because you're probably thinking right now that I'm smoking crack and wearing tin foil armor. You might still think that even after reading everything :)",21,2,False,self,,,,,

After the BoB aired I read somewhere here that the small moment where SmallJon sees and meets Jon at the battlefield he hesitates and seems lost for a little while and that the reason for this is; the Umbers as the house located in the furtherst north, have always fought the wildlings most and that he and his house were sincerely only caring against the wilding threat and that SmallJon was conflicted when he was to fight Jon as he was his liege lord in his mind still and for him this was only about the wildlings and had no desire to betray the Starks and fight Jon.

If there is truly no afterlife, then in atheistic medical terms, wouldn't his personality have been completely and irretrievably DESTROYED when he died, such that any resurrection of his body would produce either a brain-dead vegetable or at best an infantile state stripped of all previously-developed identity?

Well, I have a few theories:

A. There actually may be an afterlife after all, but Jon didn't experience/remember it because he was going to be revived, per a form of predestination (the general concept of which has been demonstrated before in the series with the fate of Hodor).

B. There is no *conscious* afterlife, but instead of ceasing to exist altogether as believed in atheistic medical terms, a dead person's identity/consciousness is ""recorded"" in a permanent state of suspension by some God or other force of cosmic order, and can be resumed in the extremely rare event of a resurrection such as Jon's.

C. There is some form of afterlife, but it consists of a soul/identity stripped down to its fundamental core, freed of most or all physical sensations and inhibitions that we take for granted, and is thusly incomprehensible to anyone living in a flesh-and-blood body. Credit to u/teo1315 for bringing this idea up as a possibility.

...The issue of all this also raises the question of whether Jon experienced literally *nothing* while dead, as in his perception was that he found himself waking immediately after dying without any form of ""waiting"" in between, or more like a concrete ""Nothing"" in a Neverending Story type of sense, i.e. [this trope?](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath)

Believe me or dont (in which case, evidence is below), I found one: Every major character dies at the moment they get what they want.

So basically every character who wants something dies (or at least loses) at the moment they are about to get it. In other words: The moment before a character achieves his/her goals, he/she dies. Dont believe it? Lets look at some of our examples. 

So lets start with one of the most shocking deaths we can remember, thats right, Im talking about Ned Stark. First lets find out what the goal of Ned is. At the end of season one he has been researching the legitimacy of Joffreys claim on the throne. He finds out Joffrey has not got any of the old kings blood running through his veins. At the moment he does what he thinks is the ultimate honorable thing to do, confronting Joffrey and sue him for high treason, he gets stabbed in the back by Littlefinger and gets thrown in the dungeons ultimately awaiting death. 

Speaking of the bitch, lets move on to Joffrey. Same thing: what was he about to get? You may think now: he was the king he already had everything right? Wrong. He didnt have the people, and he didnt have a wife to give him an heir. Now fortunately for him, his fianc had exactly what he needed: the people. But, I hope you are already seeing the pattern, at the moment he was celebrating the wedding that got him everything he had, he was assassinated by Littlefinger. 

Going from the one bitch to the second, were going to take a look at Ramsay Bolton. The little fucker was sitting on his nice throne playing ruler over the North, he had his stuff good, but there was one tiny nuisance, you see, there was this family called the Starks, who decided to challenge his position, and because of that, his people started doubting him. So what better way to deal with that problem then to lure them into a trap, and demolish their army, solidifying his position once and for all. Everything went to plan, and just as he was about to wrap things up, a certain character nicknamed Littlefinger marched in with an huge army, and long story short, sad day for Ramsay that ended in him getting eaten by his own dogs. 

Okay, I realise that that was a lot of Littlefinger, but be assured, if this theory is true, he will be dead at the end of this series. I mean, he is one of the most ambitious man of Westeros, and he wants nothing less then sit atop of the Iron Throne with Sansa by his side. Now it may happen his plans change, but one thing I can say, at the moment he his about to succeed,   hell drop dead. 

[DISCLAIMER: Littlefinger hasnt got anything to do with this theory, the fact that he kills these examples is pure coincidence.]

But there are other characters with big plans. Take Daenerys, she wants to conquer the entirety of Westeros. Which she will probably almost succeed in, but ultimately, she will die. I trust you all can find out who wants that, and thereby are able to predict who dies. Now a better question is. Who will survive? Well, who truly wants nothing you ask. There are guys I question, like Tyrion or Varys, but one character I am sure of: Jon Snow. At this moment, he wants nothing, yet he gets everything. Well, if you dont want anything, you cant reach your goal, and thereby, you dont die. Therefor I think Jon Snow will win the Game of Thrones, maybe together with Tyrion and Varys, but Jon for sure. 

If you have any questions or want to try me in proving my theory, be sure to comment, and I will try to respond as much as possible. 

I wanna thank TacocaTNL for helping me out with getting this theory on paper, so thanks!",33,15,False,self,,,,,

So Benjen Stark came into the show in Season 6 after not seeing him since Season 1. As we all know, he is one of the undead. But he is not like the rest of the wights-he is a good guy. 

Here's the theory: What if Benjen Stark secretly is not a good guy? What if he has been dispatched by the Night King to being Bran over the wall?

Now you may be thinking to yourself, why does it matter if Bran Stark gets over the wall? Think back to Season 6 Episode 5, ""The Door."" The Night's King touched Bran, and when he did they were able to come into the tree. What if when Bran goes over the wall, the white walkers can come too because the Night's King marked Bran.

Possibly Jon himself at some point too. If that's true, then the following would be a great way to take Littlefinger by surprise; Varys meets with Jon and informs him that Littlefinger was the one who offered Ned his help and then betrayed him - That Littlefinger was the mastermind behind Ned's death and everything the Starks had to suffer through. So Jon sends a raven to Winterfell directly to Sansa who's in charge of things while Jon is gone, and after reading through the letter she decides to hold a meeting with all the other Northern houses inside Winterfell similar to when Jon was named KITN. This is where they could do a callback to Catelyn Stark in the form of when she captured Tyrion and rallied all her friends in the inn to help take him prisoner - Sansa informs everyone of what Littlefinger had done to her father - their old lord - and proclaims that Littlefinger always acted only if it benefitted him, and that he is not and never was an ally of House Stark. That he betrayed their lord from the first day the two of them had met.

Now at this point, she could either directly call for his head (Jon could have asked her for this in his letter) or call upon everyone in the room to seize him and throw him in the dungeons, and let them decide his fate.

Ever since Littlefinger confessed to Sansa that everything he does is done for himself to be on the iron throne i've been hoping that somehow, someway, he gets caught off-guard by her. And this would be a great way to both catch him by surprise, and also give Sansa that final bit of character progression by actually not falling for Littlefinger's cheap shots at causing a rift between her and Jon (which people suspect is going to happen, sadly), instead causing her truely see him for who he is and avenge her father.

I'd like your thoughts on this guys, if Littlefinger were to fall next season would something like this be a good way to finally beat him? It'd imply that not only did Sansa out-wit him, but that Varys managed to beat Littlefinger once and for all.",25,16,False,self,,,,,

In the books, Jon Snow's true parentage is hinted at, on the show it's been confirmed, basically. There were other things that contributed to the war/overthrow of the Targaryens like the Mad King's own antics, but the kidnapping of Lyanna Stark served as a catalyst.

It led me to wonder several things, and how the series (whether show or book) could be different. Such as...

What if Rhaegar was the one to have won at the Trident, instead of Robert? How would he have dealt with the aftermath of his actions, especially after coming to the Tower of Joy and finding Lyanna dead? And with a son, assuming Ned did not take Jon away beforehand. He would also have to deal with knowing that his actions brought about the ruin if his family, especially the death of his wife and children. Who knows, his actions might have pissed off so many people that he might have been forced to give up the crown to Viserys, or someone not of House Targaryen. (Stannis might even have gotten the crown as he and his brothers were the grandsons of a Targaryen princess)

What if it was Lyanna who had lived? I think she would have given Jon to Ned and made him make the promise because there was no way Robert would have let Jon live. If Lyanna had survived to marry Robert, I think the Lannisters would have schemed, possibly to kill Lyanna so they could marry Cersei to Robert. Tywin wanted his daughter to be married to someone powerful because of the influence, like how he wanted to marry her to the heir of House Tyrell after Robert's death. (I think Robert would still have cheated on Lyanna, but she would still be treated with more respect than Cersei would have been)

What if both of them had lived? There's still the matter of Elia Martell, and I'm not sure the people would have been welcoming of Lyanna and Jon because of the war caused by her kidnapping. Rhaegar was a married man with two children, had he been unmarried the kidnapping might have made more sense, but did Rheager honestly think he could get away with kidnapping/impregnating Lyanna? The Martells would have something to say about this, at the very least. Even if R and L both survived, I sincerely doubt they would have been able to be together. All in all, Rhaegar may have loved Lyanna, but he was a real dumb shit about it.

So all in all, if one or the other or both had lived, there would still have been plenty of consequences, but I am sure that at least a few things would have been different than how they'd have turned out in the story.

EDIT: When Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna, did the Starks or other houses approach him peacefully to try to resolve the problem with as little bloodshed as possible, or was their first response to whip out their swords? it was said in the books he was popular and people were willing to wait out the Mad King's reign so that Rhaegar could become king. Yeah, kidnapping a noblewoman wasn't the smartest thing to do, but if the other houses had made no attempt to enter peaceful negotiation with Rhaegar to meditate the return of Lyanna, then you could say that they were as much to blame for the war as Rhaegar himself.",11,6,False,self,,,,,

In light of the recent video showing an scene featuring Gendry/Davos/Tyrion i wanted to discuss it and well.. See what you guys thought

Gendry is a Baratheon Bastard, born and raised in KL, son of a tabern wench that died when he was a little boy, he is Robert's bastard, and no man that ever met Robert can deny it, he is basically Robert come again.
Now, this season was about power changing hands, 
South
Cersei killed all his enemies with one swift move, but at the same time lost what was keeping the Lannisters in the throne, the Tyrell alliance, The tyrells and The Martell are aligned with Daenerys now, Tyrion is at Dany's side too, and with Cersei going apeshit he could try and convince Jaime to support Daenerys or if the Theory of the Valonqar is true and Jaime kills Cersei and dies with her then Tyrion is the rightfull heir to Casterly Rock, she has Theon and Yara too, this could mean having the iron island support too when they are done dealing with Euron.

In the North the Starks regained Winterfell, they got the Wildings,Vale,Wildings in their alliance. with Walder dead hopefully the Freys will tear themselves apart giving the BwB a chance to crush them, with the Freys gone from Riverrun the Tullys could Regain their hold, and perhaps swear allegiance to Jon/Sansa Alliance..

All together we have:
Sunspear (Dorne)
Kingslanding (the crowlands)
Highgarden (The reach)
Casterly rock (the westerlands)*
Pyke (The iron Island)
Riverrun (The riverlands)
The Eerye (The vale)
Winterfell (the north)

Well we are missing one right? can't make the eight w/o the stormlands and Storm's End. Its time to ask ourselves a question, the smallfolk/bannermen's undying loyalty is a Northern only trait?.. Some may say ""The stormlands Rallied behind Renly, not stannis the rightful heir"", well first Renly was named Lord of Storm's End by Robert himself, and Stannis is a man hard to love. Nevertheless, the Stormlands followed a Baratheon, the Stormlands have had Baratheons as their liege lord since the Conquest, a F*cking long time, so is it really that far fetched to think that the Stormlands will agree to follow Gendry granted that he had been legitimized?.. As i said he is Robert come again, and Robert was well loved at the Stormlands. 

The question now is, who will legitimize Gendry? Well we have 3 rulers that definitely could, Cersei, Daenerys and Jon. We can take Cersei out of the equation since her power will be basically limited to KL, unless Jaime decides to enforce her rule with the Lannister army.. And i dont think so, That leaves Dany and Jon.

Gendry will be legitimized by The King in the North. ""How?, gendry hasn't even reappeared again silly"", well im not finished yet. Gendry was released from DS and was told to row to KL, obviously he never got there so where is Gendry now?, certainly not rowing..

I think he made his way back to the Riverlands, more specifically The Crossroad's inn, we know that this inn has seen its fair share of shit going down.
Just to name a few:
-Big bob B. And his party rest there in their way from WF to KL, Nym taste what cunt taste like(joffrey's attack) and Lady is killed along with Mycah
-Catelyn takes tyrion as prisioner
-Arya is recognized by the Hound
-Brienne learns that Arya is still alive 

Im sure there's more, i cant say for sure, but i think that when Sansa rejects Brienne's services for the first time they are at the Crossroad's inn.. My point is, the place is important. But besides all that, the Crossroad's inn is where Gendry currently is in the books:
This inn has seen so much memorable moments, in the books and the show, and i think that Gendry/Arya/Hotpie will meet again at the inn. 
We know Arya is back on track with her list, with Walder's name erased there's only Cersei,The mountain, Illyn Payne, Thoros,Beric, and Mel.. She is closer to the BwB than any other so she may head south to Hollow Hill, not knowing that the BwB is already gone, nevertheless she will have to pass by the inn, perhaps she will want to check on HotPie, to see if he is still alive, the inn has changed hands countless times, perhaps Hotpie is the new innkeeper with Gendry as his protector.. Perhaps they will take the inspiration from Brienne's chapter and adapt the scene with some BwB rogue knigths, perhaps in the attack hotpie is killed.. I think that here is where Arya will find out about Jon/Sansa retaking Winterfell and about Jon's crowning.
I think that after she hears the news she will head North, and will ask Gendry to go with her, eventually they will get to WF to another Stark reunion, but there will be another reunion, Davos and Gendry, Davos knows about Gendry parentage, he was the one who set him free. The stormlands needs a liege lord, and a legitimized Baratheon Bastard is better than an extinct house, since Davo's storyline is in the blue now it wouldnt be far fetched that Jon will choose him to help Gendry get the Stormlands, Jon  legitimize Gendry as Gendry Baratheon and goes to win over the Stormlands, its not going to be that easy of course, they will meet opposition, after all Gendry is a lowborn Bastard and Davos is an ex-smuggler, but then again, who would the Stormlands follow?

This whole situation will parallel with S5 when Stannis offers legitimize Jon (Ned Stark Bastard nephew) to win over WF, now Jon will offer to legitimize Gendry( Stannis Bastard nephew) in order to win over SE.

So me and my friend Ed were on our Duke of Edinburgh's Award Expedition in the Lake District in late August 2016 and while travelling we started debating possible endings for the series and we came up with an absolute killer theory (and this applies to the books too providing Jon Snow is made King in the North in the books as well as the series).
So throwback to season 3 and Gendry, the bastard son of King Robert Baratheon, is rescued from the dungeons of Dragonstone by Ser Davos and since then we haven't seen him. (Obviously in the books it was Edric Storm whom Davos rescued but we'll go from Gendry as in the series he's Robert's only surviving son). Gendry's series storyline seems to have fizzled off and been forgotten about however his story seems to be too important to just leave open and unfinished. So it is our firm belief that Gendry is potentially THE most important character in completing the entire Game of Thrones story arc.
We think that at some point Arya is going to get to Winterfell and is taken into Jon's court. Gendry on the other hand will be heading towards the Wall to join the Night's Watch as he has no other place to go. Whilst travelling through the North, Gendry comes across Arya who takes him back to Winterfell with her. As Arya is introducing Gendry to Jon, Ser Davos sees Gendry and recognises him instantly, telling Jon that he is the last living son of Robert Baratheon and thus heir to the headship of House Baratheon and perhaps the biggest claimant to the Iron Throne. As King in the North, Jon has the authority to legitimise bastards, an authority that he carries out on Gendry, naming him Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. Gendry and Jon form an alliance, with Jon promising him one day that he will help him take back all the southern Kingdoms of Westeros, in the confidence that if Gendry ever became King he would acknowledge the North as an independent realm. No attention is given to this however as Jon is more concerned about the impending attack of the White Walkers than going on a southern conquest.
Not long after, Daenerys launches an attack on Westeros, defeating the Lannister army and taking the Iron Throne from Queen Cersei. Despite claiming the Iron Throne, Daenerys looks to the North to conquer the now independent realm that she believes is rightfully hers. Jon and Gendry are forced to go to war with Daenerys. When the White Walker threat becomes ever closer and Daenerys is forced to see the greater enemy as being a priority, a pact is made between Jon, Gendry and Daenerys, part of which involves Dany agreeing to marry Gendry. With the two Royal Dynsasties of Westeros combined, House Targaryen gains the support of Baratheon-Loyalist lords and House Baratheon gains the support of Targaryen-Loyalists. Ultimately, any child that Daenerys and Gendry may have (providing Miri-Maz-Duur's prophecy is somehow fulfilled) would have an ultimate unchallenged claim to the Iron Throne, sharing the blood of both Crown Factions in Westeros, similar to how the House of Tudor in England merged the warring factions of the Houses of York and Lancaster.
Now the United Kingdoms of the South and the Kingdom in the North move together harmoniously as one to war with the Night's King and his army of the dead. However, the problem of weapons arises quickly, but using the lore knowledge of Samwell Tarly, Gendry's fucking OP blacksmithing skills, and a lil bit of the fire breath of our scaly faves Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion, the Great Alliance are able to produce a substantial amount of pseudo-Valyrian Steel weapons to arm ALL of the waytowers and castles along the Wall and kill the White Walkers. For those of you who may have forgotten the lore, dragonfire was a key component in giving Valyrian Steel it's mystical properties, one of which being the ability to kill White Walkers.
Feel free to be constructive and build on our theory. Bear in mind we came up with this a few months before the recent news of a certain character being on set.",45,40,False,self,,,,,

2. Catelyn Stark. She'd sit next to Olenna and I would only invite her because she is my only favorite Stark character in s1. Plus, she seems nice- so having her counter-act Olenna would be interesting. 

3. The Hound. Because he is the Hound. 

4. Stannis. I would love to see his opinion on Melisandre after he died- y'know... because of her. 

5. Margaery. I just want to see what the wildfire felt like and what she was planning on doing with the crown and the religion. Also, she is hot.

With all these reminders, it made me wonder... how on earth is anyone to survive winter? Especially, the armies fighting the wights? I doubt we will see something like Dany killing off a dragon to feed her military like Stannis did when he ordered to have the horses slaughtered to feed his men before his failed attack on Winterfell.

Legends say that the Rhoyne River in Essos froze solid during the Long Night, so who will have food to share if winter makes it all the way to Essos? Daario in Slaver's Bay? It's seems doubtful there is anyway around full scale mass starvation and a very bleek ending.

Bastard and Dwarf.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/58vvge/everything_jon_and_tyrion_bastard_and_dwarf/,maplesyrupkebab,1477178980,"So after doing a re-run of S1, we are having one of the longest waited re-union in the form of Tyrion and Jon in S7. A dwarf and a bastard of two great men, yet come the end of S6, both have surpassed their respective fathers' shadow. Jon once was the bastard of the Warden of the North, now he is the King in the North. Tyrion, the dwarf son of the mighty Tywin Lannister, now rules next to the Dragon Queen. 

We did see both of them have a mutual respect towards each other, with Jon asking him in the very first episode ""What the hell do you know about being a bastard?"" and Tyrion remarking ""All dwarves are bastards in their fathers eyes"". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwjvDY5F_1I

I might be joining on the circlejerk of ""Tyrion is gonna be the middle man between Jon and Dany"", but yeah it's true. He is gonna be that guy. But I believe their re-union is going to be on a more personal level. Tyrion did respect Ned Stark in his own way even if Catelyn kidnapped him earlier on. I really hope that when the two parties meet each other, we get have a greeting between Jon and Tyrion, kinda like an inside joke, with Tyrion greeting Jon by calling him ""Bastard"" and Jon responding with ""Dwarf"" in a friendly manner. 

That being said, I also want either Tyrion or Varys to remark how much Jon looks like his father when they meet each other. It would just complete the sense that even though Ned is not his biological father, he did raise him as his son and that Jon embodies Ned's attitude and honor. ",8,84,False,self,,,,,

The Tyrells and the Martells have been rivals for generations, and it's weird how they are suddenly close allies within the span of a couple weeks. And if I were the Tyrells, I wouldn't want to be working with the Ironborn, people who constantly raid and pillage the coast of the Reach. I think it's also known that the Sand Snakes killed Myrcella, so does Tyrion know he is working with his niece's murderers?

I've been telling her about how Ned is probably my favorite character, and how he dramatically changes by the end of the show. How he would be forced to make decisions that would lead him on a dark path (post Episode Six, 'A Golden Crown'), and that we learn more and more about Ned as the series goes on, and it strengthens his character. Nothing I have said is technically lying.

I asked her what will happen to 'Poor Old Ned'.

'He'll get out if it. I'm sure.'

What have I done?

Sure the series is ""Game of Thrones"" but as far as i understand it, the main conflict is the white walkers as they were the first to be seen in the pilot episode.


Now, who will be the significant people in this war? Will it be Jon Snow? Bran? Daenerys? What would happen to the other characters left? (Brienne, Arya, Bronn, Cersei).

I'm thinking Daenerys' dragons will help in the battle AFTER she gets to seat in the Iron Throne with Cersei probably dead at that time - solving the who-will-seat-in-the-iron-throne plot. Thus, staying true to the book's title A Song of Ice and Fire.

Bronze Yohn seemed to see right through that lie but couldn't overrule Robin, who listens to LF. At the end of season 6, Bronze Yohn is at the meeting and declares Jon the King In The North. Do you think Sansa will ultimately turn to Bronze Yohn to overthrow LF? She can easily confirm LF was lying and with Robin not around he could take over. He seems to dislike LF and is a known ally to the Starks as he grew up with and was a good friend to Ned Stark. I imagine the show will draw out any LF conflict for a bit to have some story before the White Walkers come but I see it as an easy fix.

As some of you have already seen, there have been a lot of leaked set photos from the filming going on in Spain right now. Much of it has to do with enormous Season 7 plot lines. 

While we do not normally condone leak spoilers, we understand that at this point we are a levee in a landslide and must accommodate some level of discussion. 

#From here on out, anything pertaining to the season 7 leaks must be tagged with the or [S7] tag, NOT EVERYTHING. 

Any threads referencing the leaked set photos not tagged for [Season 7] or [S7] will be removed and OPs will be asked to post using the proper spoiler tag.

Here is my prediction: Cersei is killed by Arya Stark except Arya Stark has the face of Jamie Lannister (who will also be dead).

Here is why: When Cersei visited Maggy (the fortune teller in the woods) the fortune teller said this ""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you."" Valonqar is high valyrian for little brother. I think we would all assume that with the direction of the show/books that it would be Tyrion Lannister since he is obviously her little brother. However, Jamie is a couple of minutes younger than Cersei as he was holder her foot as he came out of the womb. 
So if Cersei is killed by Arya wearing Jamie's face it would both satisfy the prophecy and knock another person off of Arya's list.

I've had this theory bouncing around in my head for a while- might need to put on your tinfoil hats, but hang around for the ride. Jamie has been one of my favorite characters both in the books and in the show, because his character arc has been amazing. I think his story could be one of redemption and he just may bring about dawn, leading to spring. 

So - remember [that look](http://i.imgur.com/yT3AfvM.png) that Jamie gave Cersei at the end of Winds of Winter, S6, E10?

It made me think of Jamie when he killed the Mad King for insanity and because Aerys wanted to 'burn them all' with the wildfyre under Kings Landing, (which Cersei just did). Recall that Jamie, in his travels seems to have grown apart from Cersei, and has developed into a more morally ambiguous character. 

With this in mind, the legend of Azor Ahai and Lightbringer come into play here. For the second iteration of Lightbringer, Azor Ahai plunged the sword into a lion's heart (Lannister sigil, lion). For the third iteration of Lightbringer, and to have a truly powerful sword, Azor Ahai plunged his sword into Nissa Nissa's breast, killing the person he loved most. 

Jumping to a conversation between Melisandre and Jon: 
&gt; When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt ...

This quote implies that darkness has to gather (which hasn't happened yet), and that smoke and salt in some form have to happen. Ignoring the heavy handed Snow foreshadowing of Azor Ahai, another contender may fit the bill: Jamie Lannister. We know the comet has already passed, but the specific color (red) among other inconsistencies makes me double guess the implications of this. As for the salt and smoke part, it may be from Cersei's blood and the burning wildfyre. We know that salt and smoke may not literally mean salt and smoke, as we saw with the birth of Jon, under Dawn for example. 

Here's the part that requires some tinfoil and probably some more research. What I think will happen is that Jamie Lannister will plunge a sword (probably Dawn or Brightroar) into a Cersei mad with power much like he killed Aerys so long ago. My feeling is that this is going to happen at the same time Dany or the Others are arriving, meaning that Cersei is ready to light up Kings Landing in retribution (or already has). Jamie is going to kill her as invaders are on the step, much like in Robert's Rebellion. This will bring about Lightbringer, which will lead to dawn. Thus, Jamie Lannister is Azor Ahai. I think this could play out very well- it's unexpected, and really follows a redemption arc or is some kind of hero's journey for Jamie. 

Thoughts? Would love to discuss or flesh out this theory more.

Melisandre recognized in Season 6 (or 5?) that she was wrong with Stannis and Jon is Azor Ahai and she saw him in the flames. So maybe she had seen HIS victory in Kingslanding? That would mean that he will conquer Kingslanding and maybe will become King or give the throne to Dany.

Anyway, I feel like there are a lot of characters who had so much potential in making big moves in the game but weren't because of their sudden death. I've put everything into consideration in my list - actor, plot, motivations, personality, etc.

I would like to point first out some characters who I think died *peacefully* and served their purpose in the plot. Ned Stark's death I think is justified. He is your stereotyped honorable warrior and king. He had a lot of connections within the kingdom but I think his legacy is enough plus he is the right player to set everything up in Season 1. For Robb Stark, he is also written well. He's a young commander but he's proved that he is capable. He had a lot of potential but the moment he married a girl with no political ties, he's doomed. Theon betrayed him. Rickard Karstark grew tired of him. Everything was bound to fall and I think his story had a proper closure. Ramsey Snow's character development is also satisfying. Same goes to Joffrey. These kind of characters will die anyway and they did made a mark before meeting their gods.


Now, here's my list of the characters who should've lived a little longer

* Oberyn Martell - of course he's first on the list. He's like the quintessential player of the game. He's on his prime. He is smart (he had an interesting conversation with Varys and Tyrion) and he is physically skilled (he can defeat the Mountain easily). He had a position in the small council. A respectable family name. Interesting motivations. Brilliant actor. I wish we had seen more from him.

* Barristan Selmy - his death is the most senseless one in the series. Sure it gives way for Tyrion to be on Dany's council easily but does it really? I can totally see Barristan and Tyrion working along. Dany's army now is overpowered and killing Barristan won't make any difference reallly. He is regarded as one of the best swordsman in history and I hoped we could've seen it in a real fight - like a war or small engagement with notable characters. I just don't bite Harpy being dangerous. They are just slaves with fucking knives. If he can take on 5 kingsguard (men who trained for years) like carving a cake, I don't see 10 slaves killing him. Okay, realism is the key here but then it goes to the writers. They simply just wanted to kill him.

* Margaery Tyrell- she's definitely on the top 5 players of the game before she died. She's THE queen and I don't think that title would be taken out from her any time soon if Cersei didn't go full Osama. She's good in improvising and have established a good persona for the game (like GM Pycelle). I guess we won't be seeing her ""acting"" in the game nor her plans with the Sparrow in the long run.

* Khal Drogo - come on. It's Khal fuckng Drogo. He had so much build up in season 1 only to die from a scratch. We could've seen him fight in an invasion first before killing him. 1v1 with a random Dothraki isn't the way to go.

Who's yours?

We are excited to announce that we're participating in the new Spoiler Tagging system on Reddit!!

#What does it look like??

Threads that are tagged with the new spoiler system will have their own custom thumbnail. It looks like [this](https://i.redd.it/b83kf6g5xisx.gif). When you expand or enter the thread, everything will be blurred and you'll have to confirm that you want to see the spoiler in order to actually see the content. 

#What does this mean for *me*?! Do I need to change how I post?!

No! That's one of the best parts. We can integrate this system into what we already have. You do not need to change your posting habits or any spoiler tagging syntax.

------------

For right now, we will ONLY be using this new spoiler system on Season 7 production leaks/spoilers. We are hoping this system will help prevent people from being spoiled by these set videos/photos. For those of you unaware, please see the [Production Leaks Mod Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/596q28/everythingmod_ravenproduction_spoilersleaks/) ***NOTE THAT IT IS TAGGED [EVERYTHING]***. The mod thread itself contains no production spoilers.

We ask that you guys provide any feedback on this new system through modmail. We will log your feedback accordingly and pass it on to the admins for review.

Please feel free to reach out to the mod staff with any questions or you can visit the post on /r/changelog to see the [dev post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/).

I've thought this for a good amount of time and I think there's some pretty strong evidence pointing to that fact. 

First off let's start with his description. He's a sickly black haired boy who is small in stature, which in my opinion matches how Littlefinger looks.

Next, let's talk about how Lysa is madly in love with Littlefinger and has been for as she knew him. She lost her virginity to him and got pregnant with his child, which Hoster Tully made her abort by drinking moon tea. The moon tea destroyed her uterus IMO not only does she get really sick after drinking it and this contributes to her future miscarriages, her mental state, and Robin's health issues. It would also explain why Lysa is extremely protective of Robin, not only is she the replacement for the first child of Baelish that she lost, but she finally has a child by the man she loves.

Then, not only could her and Jon Arryn not get pregnant, she gets pregnant shortly after arriving in Kings Landing and it's pretty much common knowledge that Littlefinger and Lysa were sleeping together while they both lived there.

Not only do all of these things point to Robin being Littlefingers, but it also fits with the narrative. Bastards in this series are extremely significant and it would make sense for another one to be in a position of high power in the world.

Thoughts?

Book Roose is a sociopath and would not take this lightly and under normal circumstances would have hunted down these three and killed them slowly, BUT, there was bigger game afoot. Edmure sent word to Roose that The Kingslayer was on the loose, so of course Roose would rather catch Jaime than a cup bearer and her friends.

My mother watched the 9th episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, it appeared she had a change of heart about Ned's predicament and actually *expected* his death. She's been pretty good at predictions of shows in the past (Breaking Bad especially), so perhaps I should have expected this. Her reaction, as a result, was... less shocked than expected. Nevertheless, as requested, I recorded her reaction. 

...And her reaction to the Season Finale. 

If you guys want me to put them up, I will. Be warned though, she watched it much later than she had originally intended, and may come off as sleepy. She did give me permission to upload them at my leisure. I did ask if we should stop, but I think, despite her best efforts, she's rather enjoying this show. 

Anyway, let me know what you Lords and Ladies think!

EDIT: Ehhh, screw it. Uploading now. Will Update when both of them are done.

I'm talking outside of the obvious such as Davos, who we might have already considered a pretty major character, but it's clear he's going to be important going forward with Jon. I'll just throw a few names out there to get it started and I'm using minor loosely just in terms of the impact they've already had as well as screen time so don't bite my head off:


* ***Meera*** , she honestly may have done her part already but I'm just hoping we see more of her and her house, as well as Howland. She could still be important for Bran.
* ***Gendry*** , again we all know he isn't ""minor"" but in the show he hasn't done a whole hell of a lot. Could see him being important going forward.
* ***Mel*** , this one is the opposite because I think her role is over now. Obviously she's been important but I don't see her playing a big part moving along
* ***Bronn*** , one of my favorite characters, Wondering if we'll be seeing a ton of him now as Jamie's right-hand man (No pun intended Lol) because I think Jamie will be an every episode character
* ***Varys***, nowhere near minor, actually he might be the most important but I'm just throwing him in here because I think he's going to be even more important this season.
* ***Ed*** , I don't see it but he is the Lord Commander now so anytime we go to Castle Black he'll be involved. Plus the White Walkers are marching on the wall. You also need to assume that the Watch will be taken care of now that Jon is in charge up North.



***A few places***
* I'm almost positive at some point we will see Highgarden and Casterly Rock. Actually I'm nowhere near positive, it's a hunch at best. But these two are honestly the two most frequently talked about places/people/characters/anything of all time that we've never seen.

&gt;Jon become a Targaryen, legitimized after finding something in the crypt of Winterfell

&gt;Dany goes all mad queen on him, because she's overcome with emotions.

&gt;Tyrion can't believe what Dany did to King's Landing -- he leaves her side and leaves for Asshai.

&gt;Varys knew exactly what Dany would become, he wanted her to go mad.

&gt;Varys kills Olenna.

&gt;Bran destroys the wall inadvertently, Edd and the other Brothers die in the avalanche.

&gt;Ice Dragon Emerges, heads south.

&gt;Drogon (or all three) dies because the Ice Dragon is bigger than Balerion: The Black Dread.

&gt;Jon kills Dany, his sword become Lightbringer.

&gt;Jon kills the White Walker Queen on the back of the Ice Dragon. (Yes, the leader of the whole white walker army will be a woman, twist)

&gt;Ice Dragon falls from the sky and starts to disintegrate.

&gt;Everything starts to melt.

&gt;Arya and Bran rule Winterfell together.

&gt;Sansa takes the seat as Ruler and Protector of the Realm reuniting North and South.

&gt;Samwell become the Grand Maester to Sansa and her Council. Gilly and Little Sam live in the Castle.

&gt;Last scene will be 12-15 year into the future, Sansa travels to Winterfell when she hears word of Bran having a son. Bran names his son Jon.

&gt;Arya leaves Winterfell to be Sansa's hand.

&gt;Tyrion comes back warning of another impending doom.

&gt;The sand sneks live happily ever after.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

First time poster here, hope I'm putting everything in it's correct place and this is at least mildly interesting to this subreddit.  


&amp;nbsp;


I'm running a 32-player megagame in January in Maryland, influenced by ASOIAF and specifically around the time of **Aegon's Conquest**. The rules used are my own creation; a kind of hybrid between *Diplomacy*, *Settlers of Catan*, and *Dungeon World*. We're planning for eight teams of four players, each representing the kingdoms of the time: Targaryen, Stark, Lannister, Martell, Hoare, Durrandon, Gardener, and Arryn.  


&amp;nbsp;


Within each House, players take on different tasks whose results feed back on the others. If one team member does well, it helps the others, and vice versa. The roles are:  

- Lord (*makes alliances and trades goods*)  

- Knight (*manages armies and resources*)  

- Maester (*finds secrets and relics*)  

- Heir (*reveals secrets and relics, jack of all trades*)  


&amp;nbsp;

Because the prophecy about she seeing Drogo again:


When the sun rises in the West and sets in the East. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return and not before


-When the sun rises in the West and sets in the East = Quentyn Martell

-When the seas go dry = Dany sets on fire the Dothraki Sea with Drogon to win over the khalasaar (End of book 5)

-Mountains blow in the wind like leaves = Someone blows Joramuns horn and that wind causes the Walls crushing

-These ones are obvious = When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child (Jon's child)

-Then he will return and not before = Dany dies against the Others and that's how she meet Drogo again (because her vision of the series)",38,14,False,self,,,,,

I just finished ASOS, and I hated how Jamie and Tyrion left one another in the book. I understand that this isn't meant for our enjoyment, but Tyrion comes off as incredibly ungrateful. And he lies about killing Joffrey which gained him nothing

Even if Tyrion betrayed Jamie's trust by killing Tywin in the show, they clearly loved one another and saying goodbye was difficult. Maybe the book moment was meant to show how much he cared about Tysha, but it just really bothered me. 

Am I alone in this? I get that these books show that the world is a messy, bloody place, but it just really didn't seem like an accurate depiction of how someone who was saved by their brother would act.

Upon rewatching the show I keep noticing people mention how Rob's forces decimate lannister soldiers 2 to 1 despite being mostly lightly armed and i assume less trained than the militarized lannister soldiers in red armor. 

But there seems to be some confusing inconsistency here, the scene where jaime confronts ned the Lannister soldiers seem to easily kill Neds guards, In S6 when Jaime comes to deal with the siege of riverrun it makes the Frey soldiers (formerly northern) to be stratiegically dumb and bad soldiers as Jaime and Bronn laugh at them. 

TLDR: Some scenes and conversations depict lannister soldiers as being the high standard for military in the seven kingdoms while others depict them as being awful.

Starks &amp; Targs,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5a6vhu/main_spoilers_arya_jon_have_nightmares_starks/,DutchArya,1477845735,"There is an interesting parrallel that both characters share in the bad dreams they have and where they lead.

Arya was chasing Blarion the Black cat and she gets lost and finds the hidden room below the Red Keep filled with dead dragons. 

**ARYA STARKS NIGHTMARE ABOUT KINGS LANDING**

&gt;When they had first come to Kings Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle. Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, **an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her.** She would find herself **wandering down gloomy halls** past faded tapestries, descending **endless circular stairs,** darting through courtyards or over bridges, **her shouts echoing unanswered.** In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. **Sometimes she would hear her fathers voice**, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and fainter, until it faded to nothing and **Arya was alone in the dark**.

&gt;It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. **By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home.** - Arya Stark, AGoT

~*~

Jon has this bad dream about Winterfell that has him feeling lost and unwanted. He is not really alone in the castle though. The King's of Winter are down in the crypts where Jon is being lured. He is afraid. 

**JON SNOWS NIGHTMARE ABOUT WINTERFELL**

&gt;Sometimes I dream about it, he said. 

&gt;Im walking down this **long empty hall. My voice echoes all around**, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I dont even know who Im looking for. **Most nights its my father, but sometimes its Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.**

&gt;[]

&gt;Do you ever find anyone in your dream? Sam asked.

&gt;Jon shook his head. **No one.** The castle is always empty. He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. Its black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I dont want to. **Im afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but its not them Im afraid of.** I scream that Im not a Stark, that this isnt my place, but its no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. **It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream**. He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. Thats when I always wake. - Jon, A 


Unlike Jon, Arya enters the room filled with monsters. 

&gt;""It's dead,"" she said aloud. ""It's just a skull, it can't hurt me."" **Yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom**, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. **She edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger than the first.** (Arya is literally sitting inside the skull of a Dragon. A warg and future skin-changer. Hmm.) For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted a bite of her flesh. 

After Syrio holds off the Gold Cloaks, Arya runs and only knows one way out of the Red Keep: The hidden room of dead dragons. This time the encounter is very different. 

&gt;Could she find the room with the monsters again? 

...

&gt;She would need to go down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard, that was how she'd gone last time, chasing the black tomcat . . . 

&gt;This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. Arya held the candle over her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her pass. Dragons, she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand. 

As Arya escapes through a secret tunnel under the Red Keep, she remembers Winterfells crypt:

&gt;Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell.

A childhood memory of all the Stark children (minus Rickon) in the crypts and a ghost jumps out and scares them. That ghost was Jon, covered in flour joking around. Before he's revealed, Arya punches the ""ghost"" and baby Bran is clutching Arya's hand and Robb's leg. Sansa had already run away. 


&gt;The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. ... **She was going home.** Everything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell's grey granite walls.


2 Notes:

**The tunnels under the Red Keep:**

&gt;Red Keep was commissioned by Aegon the Conqueror, yet was only finished in the time of his son Maegor. Maegor, whose mother was accused of using witchcraft in order to conceive him, and who he himself was accused of using dark magics.

&gt;About the Red Keep, he said: *""only the blood of the dragon will know it's secrets.""*

Yet GRRM chooses this way for Arya to find her freedom? 

~*~

**Where is Arya's Home?**

This line from her nightmare:

&gt;By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and **find her way home.**

In Jon's mind, is Winterfell Arya's home? In ADWD, Jon knows ""Arya"" is Winterfell yet he thinks this:

&gt;**Bring her home**, Mance. I saved your son from Melisandre, and now I am about to save four thousand of your free folk. You owe me this one little girl. - Jon, ADwD

Is the Wall Arya's home? No, it's wherever Jon is. Just like Arya's second visit to the room full of dead dragons, Jon will enter the crypts at Winterfell again and the King's of Winter will not frighten him. In fact, he will one day join them as a KiTN.

	... in the books he is a legendary figure, akin to Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder, and no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have.	
- George R. R. Martin


According to legend, Night's King lived during the Age of Heroes, not long after the Wall was complete. He was a fearless warrior named the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Later, he fell in love with a woman ""with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars"". He chased her and loved her though ""her skin was cold as ice"", and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. Night's King brought her back to the Nightfort and after the unholy union, he declared himself king and her his queen, and ruled the Nightfort as his own castle for thirteen years.

During the dark years of his reign, horrific atrocities were committed, of which tales are still told in the north. It was not until Brandon the Breaker, the King of Winter, and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces that Night's King was brought down and the Night's Watch freed. After his fall, when it was discovered that Night's King had been making sacrifices to the Others, all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden and forgotten.It is likely this led the lords of the north to forbid the Night's Watch to construct walls at their keeps, ensuring the keeps would always be accessible from the south.

Maesters are skeptical of the legend, thinking the Night's King's corpse queen was possibly a daughter of a Barrow King from the barrowlands.Some fan theories link her with the Others because of her description.",4,3,False,self,,,,,

We all know that Cersei's three children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are the products of her incestuous relationship with Jaime. 


But when watching S1 E2, I heard Cersei tell Cat this - 


[00:09:10]


I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. (Hair color indicates it was not Jaime's).


He was a fighter too...


Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. (Fever took him just like it did Jon Arryn)


It's the last thing you need to hear right now.


It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. The boy looked just like him. (confirming it was Robert's).


This means before Joffery was born, Cersei and Robert did have a baby boy who mysteriously died of fever, paving way for Joffery to be the next king!
