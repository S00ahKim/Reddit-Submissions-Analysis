My personal ""Oh shit"" moments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1hed3e/adwd_just_finished_adwd_my_personal_oh_shit/,Humdot,1372642676,"**WARNING: Massive spoilers below for non readers!**

So much awesome in this book... these are the moments that made me say ""holy shit"" or ""wtf!"" or ""that was awesome!"".

* Jon executing Janos Slynt. That was AWESOME! especially when Stannis gives him the nod of approval, I was so giddy reading that.

* Drogon killing a child, (then Danys subsequent loss of control over the dragons). This was the moment when you realise that the dragons are actually dangerous creatures, and capable of horrible things. Before this (well at least to me) they were just these awesome pets to have. I mean we hear stories of dragons causing mass destruction and deaths, but this is the first time we really see it in a negative context. 

* The reveal of Prince Aegon, and their (his company) whole scheme to present him to Dany, followed by he and Connington joining with the Golden Company and heading for Westeros.

* Tyrion being kidnapped, he was SO close to reaching Dany and he was in awesome company... then everything changes, this was super frustrating!

* Thinking Davos was going to die then the reveal of Wyman Manderys true allegiance and his plans. Most notably Davos going on a quest to find Rickon! I wonder where he is?

* Arya warging into a cat, finally another stark has learned to actually use their wargning abilities while conscious! Not just in dreams... (arguably Robb did it?)

* Quentyn Martell arriving at Meereen, Dany marrying Hizdahr while rejecting Quentyn.

* Reek. The reveal of Theon as Reek was pretty cool, though nothing overly exciting comes of it until he escapes with Jeyne(?) and reunites with Asha.

* Drogon attacking the fighting pit and Dany flying off on him was probably the best moment of the book for me. The way she tames him with a whip while surrounded by chaos, god damn that was awesome. Also Tyrion performing for her, I was really hoping they would meet then and there.

* Brienne being alive, I thought she was hung in AFFC? Oh well, she's only in the book for a paragraph but it was cool to see she's still alive. And Jaime's fucked if she takes him to Stoneheart... so that sucks. 

* Arya changing her face and completing her first real assignment for the assassins. The way she thinks to murder that insurance broker with the coin was genius.

* Jon Snow being stabbed...presumed dead... WHAT. THE. FUCK?... He better not be dead! I was so enraged, so upset when I read that chapter. The most upsetting moment of the series for me, far worse than the RW.

* And of course the ending with Varys killing Pycelle and Kevan Lannister, showing his support for Aegon. 

What did I miss?

**TL;DR: Season 5 is gonna be huge...**

In GoT Varys is talking to Ned when he's imprisoned just before his execution about honor vs. love and his daughter and the destruction of The Targaryans.

""Rhaenys was a child too. Prince Rhaegar's daughter. A precious little thing, younger than your girls. She had a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you know? I always wondered what happened to him...""

Earlier in the book Arya is catching cats as a part of her lessons with Syrio.

""The Red Keep was full of cats... One by one Arya had chased them down, snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel... all but this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. 'That's the real king of this castle right there,' one of the gold cloaks had told her. 'Older than sin and twice as mean. One time, the king was feasting the queen's father, and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin's fingers... You stay away from that one, child.'""

IT'S BALERION, RHAENYS' CAT!!! IT SURVIVED THE SACKING OF KING'S LANDING, WREAKS HAVOK ON THE USURPER, AND IS THE NASTIEST CAT IN THE CITY.

I'm a dedicated show-watcher, and after Little Finger's ""Chaos is a Ladder"" monologue, I was inspired to build a song around it and ultimately include it within the song. The song itself is entirely finished, except for editing in the speech and making minor tweaks, if necessary, around it. However, the speech is where the problem becomes apparent. I have gotten the speech into a singular Mp3 file, yet there lies the problem. The show, very aptly may I add, utilizes the music within it. And, consequently, the speech I have also has the background music. Now, I tried a few editing tricks I know, but to no avail. There seems to be no way I know of to remove just the music. So, I'm asking r/Gameofthrones for help; since I can't get the original audio from the show to work, I would like to have someone record their self saying the monologue and use that instead.

Likewise, if anyone was able to get the raw speech of the show without the music intertwined I would be forever grateful.

TL;DR:
Would you like to record yourself doing the Little Finger's Chaos Is A Ladder speech so it can be used in a song I'm working on? If so, record and link it to me :3

Link to the song; 
https://soundcloud.com/johnhauver/the-climb

Link to the speech(convenience, yay!); 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpybogxYGsI

Thanks again for those of you who took the time to read this. And to those willing to help, extra kudos!

(Any feedback on the instrumental of the song is appreciated as well! :D)",0,0,False,self,,,,,

From this, I was keeping in mind the theory that Jon Snow was Azor Ahai. Then I was thinking... ""Where's Lightbringer, then?""

Well, how did Jon Snow get Longclaw? Longclaw was Mormont's Valyrian sword, but it's pommel and hilt were remade after Jon set Mormont's tower on fire to kill the Wight. Longclaw was in that tower - it was a burning sword drawn from fire.

Yawn.  I can't figure out why I care about Season 4 at all.  Assuming it won't lead to a Dragons vs. White Walker World War, as perhaps that's a Season 8 thing, it seems Season 4 will be character building to recover from 3 seasons of killing the best characters or helping them recover from their lame domestic situations (how to sword fight with one hand, how to be a drunk in an unwanted marriage, how to learn how to swim while stuck on a boat, how to make friends with your brother after his rescue, etc.).  I imagine Season 5 will be better than 4, unless, perhaps, Arya just starts killing people in their sleep left and right?  OK, I guess I'll watch Season 4 in hopes of that, but I fear even that isn't really coming.  Even now, it seems the best characters from the series are the dead Starks.

The child is Jon Snow. When Rhaegar was dead and Eddard Stark found his sister, he took the child and brought it back to Winterfell, claiming that it was his bastard son. The reason for doing so, is that Robert Baratheon probably would've killed the child if he knew it was a (half) Targaryen. If all this is true, it basically means that Dany is Jon's aunt. Arguably none of this matters since the guy went black. But, i don't know. Maybe they'll meet in the future? Could be very interesting. I'd love to hear your opinions on this. Thanks for reading!

I was wondering something today. In ASOS the events of Joffreys wedding and Sansa escaping occur BEFORE Jamie and Brienne arrive at Kings Landing. However in the show they arrived before the wedding occurs.

How do you think the show writers will handle the issue of Brienne being sent out to continue her mission of finding Sansa and Arya if Sansa is already at Kings Landing? Shouldn't she just walk out with her? I mean (keeping with Jamies honor in the books) he wants to keep his promise to Catelyn so he should technically agree to let Brienne take her.

Do you think they're just gonna have Tywin say ""no you cant take her"" and that will be that until she eventually escapes after the wedding?",6,1,False,self,,,,,

I love the picture Varys is drawing in my head and I am looking for a very nice poster of that situation. Like three powerfully man surrounding a normal sellsword. 
 
Some ideas where I can find it?


&gt; Varys: Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?

&gt; Tyrion: Why? Am I about to hear one?

&gt; V: Three great men sit in a room, a king, a priest and the rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives? Who dies?

&gt; T: Depends on the sellsword

&gt; V: Does it? Hes not the crown, no gold, no favor with the gods

&gt; T: Hes got the sword, the power of live and death

&gt; V: But if the swordsmans who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible:  Joffrey, the executioner, or something else?

&gt; T: I have decided I dont like riddles

&gt; V: Power resides where men believe it resides, its a trick, a shadow on the wall, and a very small man can cast a very large shadow*",26,22,False,self,,,,,

I finally finished it last night so we took it to a pub and gave it a spin.

It was a really, really fun game.  It's like chess, but you don't know what half the board will look like when you choose your setup, you don't know which units you'll still have after the initial blood bath, and each game really is different.  It did take a few games for us both to stop making illegal moves because of forgotten rules, but once we got the hang of it, it became very intense and strategic.

We did tweak the rules a bit when things seemed unbalanced and resolved ambiguities in them.  Those changes and clarifications were:

* The Catapults shoot in lines of length up to 2, not anything in a 2 block radius.  They're still one of the best pieces, but before the change they seemed completely broken.
* Crossbowmen and Catapults can only kill dragons with ranged attacks.  It didn't make sense to think of a crossbowmen killing a dragon in melee combat.  We're sort of up in the air still about the Trebuchet in this regard, as it is another ranged unit, but it ranks right below the dragon.
* The Trebuchet's initial shooting direction is up to the person setting it up.
* When you bash down a Fortress with a piece inside, you bounce backwards along the path you took to the first square legal for you to land on (usually one square back in the direction from which you came).
* Who goes first is chosen at random, but after the setup is done.

I really recommend trying out these rules if you like board games.  They're a ton of fun.  Has anyone else tried them and come up with different tweaks?  Also, now I'm really interested in making a permanent set of pieces/tiles/board/screen.  Does anyone have suggestions of good media to use to make little sculptures for someone who is crafty, but not a talented artist?

It's been a ~~hell~~ seven hells of a season, and as with every season, the show has gained more and more viewers. A lot of this is going to be a rehashing of old things for new subscribers, but I'd suggest everyone read it.

1. **ALL posts need a bracketed spoiler scope in the front of the title.** This is a relatively new rule, implemented to make spoiler scopes clearer. The scope not only tells the casual redditor what the post itself might spoil, but it sets the tone of discussion in the comments. A picture from the first episode may have different discussion with a [S3] tag on it than if it had a [S1E1] tag in front of it. Relatedly, **[Possible Spoilers] is not a valid scope.** You must be sure to clearly define the spoiler scope in the beginning of the title. Your tag may say [No Spoilers], [S3], [AFFC], whatever you want as long as the scope is clearly defined.

2. **[All Spoilers] denotes spoilers for all the books and all the episodes.** If you see a post with [All Spoilers] in the title, it means that everything is okay to post without a tag (except speculation on the future of the series, which still requires the green speculation tag). If you post with [All Spoilers], be prepared for people to talk about the later books. **If you want to define the scope as the most recent episode, then use [All Show], [Season 3], or [S3E10].**

3. **[No Spoilers]** means that the post and discussion should contain no discussion about the story. **[No Spoilers] should be used for meta discussion about the show, books, or subreddit.** For example, if someone asks how to get a copy of ADWD's paperback, that can say [No Spoilers], because it doesn't have anything to do with the story itself.

4. Remember that spoilers should be clear and direct. This next one applies to both spoilers in a comment and in a title. **Do not use clarifiers like ""early,"" ""minor,"" ""soft,"" etc. in the scope.** It doesn't matter whether it's a minor ASOS spoiler, it still gets a regular [ASOS] spoiler.

5. **The third season only covers the first portion of A Storm of Swords!** Even if you're totally caught up on the show, do not hover over ASOS book spoilers. In general, you should only look at spoilers for things you have actually read or seen - they do not translate 1:1 - and if you haven't seen or read the exact thing the scope names, you risk being spoiled. Spoilers are for what the scope says, and both book and show fans can be spoiled if they view something whose scope they haven't seen/read

6. **Multiple tags in the post scope are separate.** For example, you can say [ASOS/S3/Theory] and that means:
  * ASOS spoilers (for the whole book!)
  * Season 3 spoilers
  * open speculation

7. On the sidebar, there are links to four different ways to view the subreddit. **NORMAL MODE** lets you view the subreddit as it normally appears. **SHOW SPOILERS** lets you view the subreddit with all the spoilers showing so you don't have to hover, and is only recommended if you've read and watched everything. **TALK ONLY** lets you view the subreddit's self posts, while **MUTE TALK** lets you view the subreddit without them. Feel free to use these filters to your advantage.

8. Please remember that only content relating to the show or book series is allowed on the subreddit. An image macro over a picture from the show is perfectly fine to post. But if the image itself isn't related, then it doesn't belong. For example, a Confession Bear meme about the series doesn't belong here. All of those posts can go to /r/ASongofMemesandRage. A good rule of thumb is that **if it isn't relevant to Game of Thrones without the title, then it doesn't belong here.**

9. Please check out our posting policy before submitting a link. We on the mod team keep reposts down to a two week limit, so we'll remove anything we've seen recently. We also remove certain content that is overposted. A list of overposted content that we try to limit can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post).

10. As always, be respectful to each other. We don't like people namecalling or being rude. This extends to the actors. Please don't objectify them, especially the young'uns. I don't like to think how many inappropriate comments I've read about Maisie Williams or Sophie Turner. 

Thanks for reading all that. Be on the lookout for a mod post in the near future about what sort of things will happen here on the off-season, including the recent [Preliminary Content Poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1he0mz/mod_raven_the_great_summer_content_poll_of_2013al/).

My problem is caused by a lack of willpower and over-curiosity; I tend to go into threads that are marked beyond my spoiler-scope in the show (I'm current), and I've had lots and lots of things spoiled that way. It's my own fault, I know.

My question: Is there an existing system (Reddit Enhancement, maybe?) that would allow subscribers to this subreddit to specify where they are in the books or show, at which point the system would hide (or otherwise make un-clickable) any post that contains spoilers beyond the point that you entered?

I know this SOUNDS like a lot of work just to keep people from spoiling things for themselves because of their own stupid curiosity, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who would appreciate such a system. Does one exist? Would it be hard to implement?

TL;DR: This may be a spoiled request, I know, but is there a program that can hide posts that are marked with spoilers beyond a specified point in the books/show?",5,0,False,default,,,,,

Slow at parts for sure, but I think that goes well with the post-war Westeros. Honestly, we can't look at this in conjunction with the other books; ASOS successfully closed an act, and AFFC is starting a new act. Btw, if you haven't read AFFC and still reading this, turn away and buy/borrow/download the book. It's worth a read, but do take a day or two break from ASOS to mull things over. If you're still not convinced, you may read my POV reviews to get an idea, I'll keep it minimum to no spoiler.

Before I share my thoughts on the POVs, I honestly had no idea the fandom for Jon, Tyrion and Dany was so huge. Granted I'm reading it much, much later, and I didn't have to wait years for the book, I only missed Tyrion here. I only knew Dany was being saved for ADWD, but was surprised to see Tyrion and Jon left out as well. But (in my opinion) sufficient substitution were made.

First let's jump into the Iron Islands. The **Ironborn** chapters were really interesting to me. Going in, many told me to skip the chapters or said they were boring. I absolutely loved it. Victarion and Euron are on top of my character tier list, and can't wait to see their plans unfold. People complained about kingsmoot and Damphair's fanaticism, but I loved the new traditions being revealed. I'd give it 4/5.

Away from the salt and iron, let's move south to sand and sun. The **Dorne** chapters introduced many, many new things. Unlike the Ironmen (*heh*) we haven't had much exposure to Dorne, or the Martells. At times it was a little bit overwhelming (keeping track of the sand snakes and the new geography being presented), but it unfolds slowly. My biggest problem was the separation of the chapters. The first three Dorne chapters happen rather quickly (in the first half of the book), then you have till the end to get the conclusion. Which, to be fair, was a great one, but brought some characters back to square one. Good chapters, could've had better pacing. 3/5.

Now for our favorite damsel-out-of-distress, **Brienne**. So starting off, she receives a mission from Jaime: find Sansa and protect her. This would be a great mission to read about, if we didn't actually know where Sansa is (she has her own chapters). We do get to see Brienne's inner thoughts, and it's heartbreaking. But it was dull reading through pages of her asking where Sansa was, and taking wrong routes. Her companions definitely made her chapters more readable. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad by average standards, but compared to the other chapters, it's a bit boring. 2/5.

**Sam the Slayer**. Only reason we have Samwell chapters is because he leaves the north, and thank the Gods. I left the books a bit ambivalent about the Samwell chapters. While I enjoyed his chapters, I didn't particularly enjoy it because of him. It was because of Aemon, Xhondo and even Gilly. Nevertheless, the Sam we end up with is a stronger, braver Sam. 4/5.

On his layover at Braavos, Sam meets Cat. Otherwise known as **Arya**. I personally found her storyline is ASOS a bit dull. Oh boy does it change here. If you already adore Arya, then you don't need any other convincing. She dives into Braavos Arya, but resurfaces as someone different. 4/5.

Looks like the Starks are just tired of being Stark. Meet Alayne. Also known as **Sansa**. She is taken to the Eyrie by Petyr Baelish, who's recently a widow. Like Sam, much of what makes Sansa's chapter alluring is Petyr Baelish. Without Varys, Petyr is un-matched. But, Sansa also comes to her own. Believe me when I say I can imagine her being a core player in the game of thrones. 5/5.

In stark contrast (*heh*) we have the Queen of Hearts, **Cersei**. Someone told me previously that reading Cersei's inner thoughts can actually cause a sane person to go insane. I'd say that's underestimating the effect. I think Littlefinger describes her actions the best when he comments that Cersei is screwing up the kingdom faster than he anticipated. Lovely. More importantly, I think Cersei's chapters reveals a lot about GRRM's characters. You can never fully trust these POVs. Best example I can think of is Eddard's view of Jaime. Great chapters, even though it hurt to read sometimes. 4/5.

I had to save the best for last. **Ser Jaime Lannister**. I've actually been a Jaime fan when I was halfway thought AGOT. I wouldn't say I was completely sold, but I thought he was holding onto something. After each book, I'd mull over the characters, and with Jaime I always found myself justifying his actions, at least from his point of view. Still the attack on Bran wasn't right. And he lost a hand a for that (same hand he used to push Bran off, mind you). And with Brienne showing him now all women are Cersei, I think he finally severed his last ties with the old Jaime. Some of my absolute favorite scenes for the whole series comes from the Jaime chapters, the bear pit revisit, conversation with aunt Genna, and the very last Jaime scene on AFFC. 5/5.

There it is, let me know what you guys think about the chapters, I'd love some other thoughts. I can't wait to start ADWD.",63,43,False,self,,,,,

I had wondered whether they'd bring Ser Alliser back for Season 4 since the last time we heard of him was in Season 1 when The Old Bear sends him off to King's Landing with the hand of the wight. After that he just seems to disappear completely.

How do you reckon they'll handle his return and explain where's he been for so long and when he met Slynt? Many show watchers seem to have trouble remembering all of the main characters, let alone a character that was only in a few episodes of Season 1.",1,0,False,default,,,,,

When trying to decide what to do today, he cleverly decided to spoil the rest of the show and books for me. However, I'm not so sure these spoilers are really spoilers...is this really what happens??

HERE IT IS - WHAT HE SAYS HAPPENS: 

[AGOT](#b ""Hodor realizes he is a secret targaryen and begins a campaign to take back the iron throne. bran breaks his arms as well as his legs. brienne dies after eating strawberries, which apparently she is allergic to. jaime attaches a puppet to his hand and becomes enamored with it, leaving cersei in the dust. robert comes back from the grave, does a keg stand, dies again. jon snow gets a haircut. gilly finds out she is descended from the gillyfish and returns back to the ocean. sam tarly watches her go, lighting a paper lantern on the ocean to mark her departure. He and jon snow become civil partners and raise gilly's child as their own. jorah mormont turns into a literal bear. barristan selmy has a heart attack climbing some stairs. walder frey jerks off in a movie theatre. tywin takes off his face, revealing he is actually benjen stark, returned from beyond the wall. the martells never show up, but are actually revealed to be cardboard cut outs standing in for a kingdom. littlefinger meets his long lost brother, bigfinger. they do not get along. robert arryn decides it's pretty weird he is still breastfeeding and decides to open up a law firm. his first case is the divorce between tyrion and sansa, after sansa is caught having an affair with a different dwarf, gimli from the lord of the rings. joffrey learns a little bit more about friendship. arya goes to king's landing and kills everyone, before realizing that it's a different king. classic mixup. the hound goes to Jamaica and comes back a rastafarian, now referred to as the lion. he smokes a lot of weed and eventually forgives his brother, who decides to burn the other side of his face. loras tyrell is still gay. jacen h'gar gets a different face, who is paula deen. he kills roose bolton by giving him too much better. ramsay snow also reveals he is benjen stark, returned from the north. theon and his severed penis team up for a buddy comedy as the two attempt to reunite. dany's dragons attempt to give her sound dating advice, but she ends up ignoring them and dating grey worm. grey worm realizes he has no grey worm, and it ends up not working out. bran realizes he can turn into plants, but accidentally gets stuck in hodor's mind as well. hodor enacts revenge and uses the plants to kill everyone in westeros. this is referred to in the books forevermore as ""the Hodoring"""")

So, obviously that's pretty unlikely...but what if it isn't...? O_O

About halfway through the book, we see Catelyn and Brienne witness the shadow thing that looks like Stannis kill Renly and disappear. Later, there is the Davos chapter where he and Melisandre sneak under Storm's End by boat and this is where he sees her give birth to her shadow baby.

On the TV show, we see Melisandre give birth to the shadow baby first and THEN we see Renly die, and that's how I was expecting it to happen in the books as well but it happened the other way around. 

I triple checked to make sure I wasn't messing up the timelines, and in that same chapter with Davos/Melisandre they speak of Renly's death in the past tense, meaning she's already sent her shadow baby to assassinate him.

So my question is, in the books, does Melisandre have multiple shadow babies? or did she send it after Renly, suck it back up inside her and then sick it on Ser Cortnay Penrose? I'm guessing the former, but does that mean that after she sends a shadow to kill someone, it just disappears and dies? meaning she has to ""create"" another one every time she wants someone dead? Or are they floating around Westeros, waiting for her command?

I hope I didn't make that too confusing!",27,26,False,self,,,,,

I just recently noticed Daenerys' eye color changes to purple in the final scene of Season 1 when she's exposed to fire:
http://imgur.com/tFjJEc3        

Game of Thrones loses certain things from the books (ie, in the books Ser Barristan is hidden from us for a long time as he travels with Dany, which is not possible/practical in the show, so he's immediately revealed), but also has the ability to gain things -- such as exposing those of Targaryen blood when exposed to fire.    

It could be used to foreshadow at some point that Jon Snow is (according to current leading internet theory) is in fact a Targaryen post Winds of Winter release on the show -- this would be an interesting way to tip viewers off that wouldn't be possible in book form.     

Why else change her eye-color during that pivotal scene?",8,0,False,self,,,,,

&gt;*Jul. 4th, 2013 07:01 am (UTC) Re: House Martell Casting*

&gt; I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he will turn out to be a wonderful Red Viper.
I do know that David and Dan and HBO do favor having a racially and ethnically diverse cast on the series. It is true that we've lost several black characters who appear in the novels (Chataya and Alayaya, Jalabhar Xho, Strong Belwas), but to balance that, characters like Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, both white in the books, have been played by black actors. Missandei as well, though in the books the Naathi are golden-skinned, not white.

&gt;As for the Dornishmen, well, though by and large I reject one to one analogies, I've always pictured the ""salty Dornish"" as being more Mediterranean than African in appearance; Greek, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, etc. Dark hair and eyes, olive skin. Pedro Pascal is Chilean. (Check out Amok's version of the Red Viper, that's how I saw him. Or Magali Villenueve's beautiful and sexy portrait of Princess Arianne).
When and if the show introduces Prince Oberyn's daughters, the Sand Snakes, I expect we will see the same diversity as in the books, ranging from Tyene (blond and blue-eyed) to Sarella (light brown skin, as her mother was a Summer Islander). And I expect that the crew of the CINNAMON WIND will all be cast with black actors... assuming, of course, that Sam's voyage remains in the story.

I'm in the beginning of A Clash of Kings and couldn't help noticing parallels between the Seven and certain characters that stood out as examples of them personified. 

[ACOK] (#b ""Especially during the burning of the Seven in the first Davos chapter."") 

[Excerpt] (#b ""The Maiden lay athwart the Warrior, her arms wide-spread as if to embrace him. The Mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face. A longsword had been thrust through her heart, and its leather grip was alive with flame. The Father was on the bottom, the first to fall. Davos watched the hand of the Stranger writhe and curl as the fingers blackened and fell away one by one, reduced to so much glowing charcoal. ..."")

[ASOIAF Wiki] (#b ""The Father: represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead. The Mother: represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as ""the strength of women"". The Maiden: represents purity, love, and beauty. The Crone: represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern. The Warrior: represents strength and courage in battle. The Smith: represents creation and craftsmanship. The Stranger: The Stranger represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to."")

I guess I want to know which characters other people think represent which gods. Mine would be:

[The Father] (#g ""Ned Stark. He was a decent judge of character, fatally honorable. He was the first to fall."")

[The Mother] (#g ""Danaerys. She is the Mother of Dragons, and in the show she is a mother and leader to the freed slaves and represents everything the wiki says the Mother represents."")

[The Maiden] (#g ""Arya. Maybe not beauty so much, but the way the Maiden is described in the excerpt above as opening her arms to the warrior shows her love of her family which leads me to my next one ..."")

[The Warrior] (#g ""Jon Snow. Snow is a good enough swordsman to piss off Ser Alliser Thorne. I'm sure there are a few others who fit here."")

[The Stranger] (#g ""The Wights. Read the excerpt about black hands and such, maybe the Others."")

[The Smith] (#g ""Gendry. He is a blacksmith's apprentice and made the ornate bull helm."")

[The Crone] (#g ""Melisandre. She is a witch, a crone, wise in the ways of the Lord of Light (lantern in the excerpt). Maybe Old Nan, because she is old and has so many stories?"")

So, tell me what you think. Who do you think best represent the Seven? If you can find where this has been discussed before, PM me. I'm kinda new to this sub, so if I posted something incorrectly message me and I'll fix it. I don't wanna spoil anything.",20,8,False,self,,,,,

The first regards Robert Arryn's wardship: the reader first hears - from a Lannister source I believe - that Tywin was supposed to be Robert's guardian (can't remember whose POV supplies this), but later Catelyn learns that Stannis would have had custody over him. It makes sense that Lady Arryn would have fled with Robert if he were to be Tywin's ward, given her distrust of the Lannisters, but why did she fear the arrangement with Stannis? And, more importantly, why does it even matter? Why do the Lannisters want people to think Robert was going to be Tywin's ward?


My second question might be the result of confusion from the show-to-book crossover. In the famous peach chapter in ACOK, Stannis says he was the first to learn of Joffrey's parentage, and he prompted Jon Arryn to gather evidence and tell Bobby B. Renly writes off Stannis' story as a fraudulent attempt to prove he is the rightful heir. I recall (and this may be confusion from the show) that Ned sent Stannis a letter alerting him to Cersei and Jaime's incest in AGOT and naming Stannis heir. Was Stannis really the first to learn the truth about Joffrey? And if Stannis had received Ned's letter, why didn't he offer it as proof during the confrontation with Renly at Storm's End?

If either of these will be clearly resolved later in the books, just let me know",19,17,False,self,,,,,

OK, so having seen only the pilot episode and having hardly any background on the series otherwise, here are my questions:

* I assume the TV series covers more than just the first book, given there are now three seasons of it. With that in mind:

	* Why isn't the show called *A Song of Ice and Fire* instead?

		* Did they not expect a demand for filming beyond the first book?

	* Do they plan on filming the entire series of novels?

		* If so, doesn't that mean GRRM will need to write the remaining books rather soon, before the cast starts showing signs of age?

			* Or will that not be a problem, given the scope of time progression in the series?

			* Has that led to worries that such deadlines may lead to a negative impact on said books' quality?

* Is it highly recommended I read the books first? I don't have an abundance of free time, and they look so very, very thick...

* Is there a minimal-spoiler guide to the various characters/relationships/factions/allegiances/locations I could use for a reference while reading/watching? As far as fantasy lands go, I find Equestria a lot easier to follow.

* The pilot's ending... And the ""You have a woman's body now"" scene... Is there a chance GRRM wrote such stuff for the same reason Tarantino does a lot of scenes revolving around women's feet?

	* Also: Just... What the hell?

 **SPOILERS TO COME***
In the prologue, this guy Pate at the citadel is trying to do the horizontal monster-mash with Rosey, and so he works out a deal with the hooded guy, who casts some sort of spell on him, or some sort of unidentified trickery, and the implication at the end of the prologue is that Pate dies.

In the last chapter, it is revealed that Pate is alive, and this revelation is given a context that sort of (to me anyway) implied that it was a huge reveal.  After all, it's the last sentence of the book.  However, I fail to see why this is a huge deal... am I missing some link between the end of the book and the beginning?

So in summary:
-Who is Pate, and why is he such a big deal?
- Do we know the identity of the hooded man yet? If so, when was this revealed, I must have missed it...
- Do we know what the hooded man did to Pate in the prologue?
- and if someone could give me a quick recap on who Marwyn and Alleras the Sphinx are, that'd be great too. 

Thanks very much, happy reading!

Here are some that I feel are thought of better than they should. 

Tywin. He gets this reputation as this commanding badass but really other putting joffery in his place Tywin an arrogant dumbass that too freely steps on anything to get what wants. I'm frankly shocked he hasn't sparked a populist rebellion and religious uprising. 

Lyanna Stark. I see many people paint her like a romantic figure and play up a romance with rheagar. But in realityif she went with rheagar willingly and stayed with him willingly then she is a bigger cunt than cersi could dream of being. Her little trisk with the prince cost her father and brother their lives in cruel and tortuous fashion. Yet she stayed. Her other brother and betrothed raise their banners in rebellion and plunge the kingdom into war and she stayed. Her brother risks his lives to come get her and not an apology? 

If she wasn't abducted and raped and kept against her will she wins the biggest cunt in westeros award in a land slide.

But after reading through the books, those scenes dont ever hapen, nor do the dialogue. The closest thing that I read that slightly hinted towards it was i believe in AGOT where it was mentioned that Renly was fond of fashion, which isnt the biggest hint.

I'm going with Sansa.  Probably sounds ridiculous but I like how she is completely naive at the beginning of the series but is slowly learning how to 'play' the game.

Littlefinger is teaching her how the game is played and it doesn't seem like she's resisting LF's advances as much as I thought she would.  I'm thinking she's making LF her pawn while she soaks in as much knowledge as possible before making her move.

She was supposed to eventually be queen by marrying joffrey but that didn't work out for her.  It would be nice to see things come full circle and she becomes queen on her own terms.

It's always the ones you don't suspect that are dangerous :p

Two of my friends are non-readers and had no time to watch it yet but want to catch up.. with me there. We watched the first two seasons together and we watch a ton of other shows together as well. It's something we do. Just to make you understand that they wouldn't 'just' watch it without me.

Now that worked until S3E7. They plan on watching Episode 8-10 back to back. I know what happens. I know their feelings for certain characters. Their reactions are priceless. They expect Robb to win this. They have no clue. It's beautiful.

Problem is..I can't stop grinning like an idiot. I start laughing just thinking about it. 

What do I do now? I've been good until now.. but that scene. I know how they will react. I know it.

I want to see their reaction.. but I don't want to spoil it. Even telling them to watch it without me would get them thinking something is up. We've had that problem before.

And I want my Schadenfreude!

I know this is such a first world non-problem... 

By the old gods and the new, I can't fuck this up. Help. 

Help.

Mormont found the sword in the burned ruins of his room. Clearly it was very fire-resistant and this struck me in the context of being up in the North, that perhaps it could have more value than  meets the eye.

The properties of the steel are mentioned ad nauseum - sharp, strong, etc due to spells. It occurred to me that perhaps GRRM is setting up valyrian steel to play some specific role later on in the larger ice/fire battle? That perhaps the magic will play a vital role later on, in fending off the evil beyond the wall? For how much the substance is talked up, I am hoping that it will turn into something more than just a prestigious semi-mystical status symbol. Any thoughts?

In this series we have two lower-ranked teams fighting each other. Denial, formally Artyk gaming, has had some success beating lower-tier NA teams and even taking some series off of iCCup and KP in BO1s. However, they were absolutely demolished versus the top-tier NA teams of Dignitas, EG, and Liquid. Even today when it was EG vs. Denial, Demon and Bamboe fed so many kills it was ridiculous but Bdiz and Fear prevented them from winning even with the most sloppy play. The day before that EG clowned them bad too. They did put up a fight today, but alas are not up there in skill yet.


[Denial Profile](http://www.joindota.com/en/edb/team/1247-denial-e-sports)



[4FC](http://www.joindota.com/en/edb/team/449-4-friends-chrillee) are pretty wonky too. They lose to most of the notable Western teams, and even today got 2-0'd by Dignitas. At least Denial can say they beat Dignitas once. 4FC can also say they 2-0'd EG too however.


Overall, these odds seem pretty accurate. This is Denial's test against some lower-tier European competition, and I'm interested in seeing how the lag factors in here since Denial plays from Peru and 4FC is European. Even with a NA server I think 4FC will have a huge ping advantage in these games. I think I would give the edge to Denial though, since I don't like 4FC's dumb picks and Denial goes with a lot more standard and stable line ups.

Prediction: Denial, but only betting commons.

I feel that book and show Davos have very striking differences, though not in a way that makes the core of their characters different. As a first point, book Davos has far more children than show Davos, who only has Matthos. That's not a huge factor apart from making the aftermath of the Blackwater more tragic, since he's lost his only child in the show.

The big difference for me is religious faith. In the books, Davos is a very fervent believer in the Seven, arguably the most devout of all the POV characters. His distrust of Melisandre is also rooted in the fact that he doesn't like Stannis' conversion to the red faith.

In the show, Davos says this: *""I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.""* He seems to be atheistic, or at the very least agnostic. This is easily the most striking contrast between the two portrayals. It alters the motivations of his actions, in my opinion.

In the books, Davos strikes me as far more idealistic, and his moral behavior stems partly from his devout worship of the Seven. When he's survived the Battle of the Blackwater, he attributes it to the gods having a higher purpose for him, which leads to him resolving to kill Melisandre.

In the show, Davos comes across as a far more cynical man. Not cynical in the way that he doesn't believe good things can happen, but that he believes that a man has to earn a happy ending, and that's why he tries to behave in a moral and upstanding way. He knows what's right, he knows that not everyone is going to do the right thing, but he hopes to better the world by being an upstanding person and counseling the same behavior from Stannis. Show Davos puts a lot more faith in men.

The ultimate result is still and incredibly admirable, honorable human being who serves as a good foil to Melisandre in the battle for Stannis' soul. Honestly, though, I prefer the direction the show has gone with Davos. He seems far more complex and realistic, and I buy that this is a former criminal with a hidden heart of gold who eventually turned over a new leaf. Also, Liam Cunningham is a wonderfully charismatic actor and really gives a great life to the character.

Thoughts? Which interpretation of the character do you prefer?",28,45,False,self,,,,,

Now i understand that Charles Dance is someone's favourite actor (he is brilliant) and the show has somewhat humanised the character. 

but when the events of episode 9 (s3) happened everyone was going ""Fuck the Freys, or Fuck the Boltons"" and not once really did i see anyone point a finger at the painter of the massacre that was the red wedding, Tywin Lannister.

Reasons for liking Tywin :

* Puts joff in his place on multiple occasions.
* Puts Cercei in her place 
* Charles Dance


now let's see why people SHOULD dislike him:

* is HORRIBLE to Tyrion, he hates Tyrion with the fire of a thousand suns, the only reason Tyrion is alive is because he carries the name lannister and he is of use to Tywin 
* the red wedding was his plan, everything before it happens points to this, he also admits it in the tv show (ep 10)
* Does not care about people, while the Tyrells are feeding the people at King's Landing, tywin only cares about killing his enemies
* extremely untrustworthy, if it benefits him Tywin will stab you in the back at the drop of a hat
* Does not adhere to any laws or rules, He does not want to give Tyrion the castle and title that would be rightfully his since Jaime has ""taken the white"" 


so for all the people that still mention Tywin as their favourite character i ask them why, Tywin is as bad and cruel as Ramsay but gets so much admiration.",71,0,False,self,,,,,

Second, when Tyrion finds Shae in the bed, he already knew she betrayed him, but why was she sleeping with Tywin? Was it just because she feared him and wanted protection? Or was it because he just payed her more so she betrayed Tyrion. And concerning that, why would Tywin fuck a whore?

Chapter titles are almost always the POV character name, but there are a few that stray (Theon, Arya, Barristan...POV character_Book_Chapter labels below).  Once sorted (by clicking chapter/track at the top of your audio player) you can  listen to one character's story at a time letting you catch more of the little details GRRM included.  Highly recommend.

Most of my friends are telling me to watch the show first and worry about reading the books after, but I'm not so sure.

What would you reccomend? Show first or books first? I'm a big reader so I don't mind knocking back 5 books (or less) first. I'm a little worried that watching first will make it so that I never end up reading the books.

Thanks.

EDIT: As of 4:45 EDT, the consensus seems to be read the books first. I made a comment to this post reflecting that, so please reply to that one. Thanks so far everyone!

EDIT2: I'm not the type of person that needs the show to visualize the characters (assuming that GRRM does that for me). If that's the only argument for watching first, my decision might be made. However, the decision as to what order, and maybe going Book-Season-Book-Season or something could be changed. ",77,8,False,self,,,,,

First off, [ASOS, YOU'D BEST NOT HOVER OVER THIS SHOW WATCHERS](#b ""The way Tyrion murders his father just felt so off to me. For all of the series and for most of ASOS, Tyrion's proven how heavily he places weight on his sense of familial duty. Even after his trial, he defended his father's honor against Oberyn and felt utterly disgusted with the idea of being labeled a kinslayer. Tywin's clearly been a terrible, horrible person to his son, but he has come nowhere close to Cersei's awfulness, and Tyrion seems to be able to see his father's staunch, albeit twisted, sense of patriarchal duty. The only real precipitating events for Tyrion's sudden bloodlust come out of Jaime's confession at the start of the chapter and from the completely out-of-character (for Tywin) reveal that his dad is fucking Shae, also from that same chapter. This feels really flimsy to me; it's cheap drama, and didn't have that wonderful build-up that the Red Wedding and Joffrey's death had. It just feels like a cheap way to set up a paradigm shift for the southern kingdoms in AFFC."")

Second, [ASOS, YEAH ALSO A BIGGIE](#b ""Lysa's character got dumbed down so bad towards the end. That drunk confession she made was so incredibly contrived, and even before she spewed out (with amazing clarity) how Littlefinger was the puppet master of literally everything, you sorta suspected she was gonna go flying when the door opened up, and when Littlefinger stepped in you had to know. I really hope the show handles that scene differently because that one was all too predictable."")

And the last thing I'll rant about, [ASOS, PROBABLY THE BIGGEST](#b ""WHY DID HE BRING CATELYN BACK? WHYYYY?"")

Am I jumping the gun by getting discouraged here? Will the answers I seek come from AFFC?",4,0,False,self,,,,,

http://artthreat.net/2013/06/game-of-thrones-and-racist-fantasy/

I gather some of your must've definitely read it or seen it on tumblr. I'm a huge fan of the show and am trying to gather my thoughts and understand the perspective from both sides; the director &amp; the audience. My comprehension would be that the show is based in an era where such things were actually prevalent in real-life and thus could be condoned by the viewers.

I denounce the political allegories drawn out by the author but the critique on racist &amp; sexist analogies stemming from our contemporary stereotypes are hard to look past. Its important to stress that this is a commentary specifically about the show and on the racist and sexist portrayal on the part of the director/creator, inverse of which was the case with The Hunger Games movie where some of the viewers were taken aback when one of the beloved characters was portrayed by a black actress.

All in all, I suppose you can take it with a pinch of salt as the author is a comedian and may discount his words as just trying to create a controversy out of nothing but the article does a good job in looking at both-sides of the tv screen.

I read the rules to make sure I can post an open discussion on this subject and am curious to hear what you all think about it.



**EDIT: Copy pasting the article here just in case the site goes down.**


Aamer Rahman has recently caused quite a stir among Game of Thrones fandom with his Tumblr post about the HBO shows very problematic representation of race, most notably that hideous last episode of season three. Rahmans original Tumblr post and his response to the massive backlash from  fans has been reposted below, with Rahmans permission. Spoilers throughout.

RACEFAIL: GAME OF TROPES PART 1

Im late to Game of Thrones  but I caught up. And I couldnt help photoshopping this picture of Khal Drogo as a Klingon. Anyone sad enough to be familiar with both GOT and Star Trek knows exactly what Im talking about.

The Klingons are the Dothraki of Star Trek the scary, warmongering Other from the Heart of Darkness out in deep space. The great thing about imaginary black and brown people is that white sci-fi/ fantasy writers can project their repressed oriental fetishes onto a blank canvas without taking responsibility  WHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS RACIST, THERES NO SUCH THING AS KLINGONS OR DOTHRAKI! How can we be racist towards people WHO DONT EVEN EXIST?? Funny how its always real black and brown people who have to play the role of the imaginary non-existent warrior/tribal/primitive/race. (With the exception of the original Star Trek, which had white actors in blackface as Klingons.)

You can dress it up as fantasy, but we know who youre talking about.

GOT wasted no time in establishing the Dothraki as a horde of raping, warring animals who have no word for thank you and enjoy public sex games and deaths at a wedding. The codes are never original: love of war and pillaging, and animalistic sex rituals (anyone remember this tender moment on Star Trek: TNG?).



Plus some noble savage warrior code that glorifies conquest, authoritarian social order, growling, pumped up men and hyper-sexual women, beards, braids, boobs blah, blah blah. The Dothraki are a grab bag of every native/ savage/ other signifier you can think of.

But this isnt just about imagery and brown people looking bad on TV  the Dothraki storyline is just a stepping stone for Danys overall storyline which is more deeply racist  essentially, a liberal white woman who goes around saving and civilising brown people. The subtext of Danys story is a cultural war where Danys enlightened values triumph over lesser ones, where whiteness is both a conquering and civilising force.

It begins with taming the savage Drogo who rapes her like a hound takes a bitch, on their wedding night (and every night after that)  until she teaches him the tenderness of looking him in the eyes when they sleep together. Then, the reforming of Dothraki customs: Dany prevents the rape of female prisoners and even gets Drogo to back her against the wishes of his riders. Finally, she establishes herself as a leader when she gives birth to her dragons (at this point the brown people literally prostrate themselves to her).


Aamer Rahman
Barbarian cultures who dont know how to treat women bowing in the face of superior technology and military arsenal (Dragons are basically the advanced fighter jets of the GOT universe)  does this feel familiar? She then goes from city to city freeing slaves who dutifully join her quest. Danys story is, at its heart, a neocon wet dream. She is Laura Bush, advocating for the invasion of Iraq under the pretext of saving its women who are desperate to live a life like hers.

I feel like we are supposed to root for Dany because she is becoming a strong woman; originally meek and abused by her brother, she outsmarts men at their own game. We are supposed to forget that she is fighting for nothing more than her own sense of entitlement to the throne, like some upper-class brat who loses her familys fortune and eventually manages to become CEO of her own corporation. Somehow all the grateful brown people she liberates are happy to march behind her for the sake of an imperial project that they have no stake in. Oh  like every good white liberal, she manages to pick up a Black Best Friend (Missandei) along the way:

The Season 3 finale took things to the next level; after liberating another city of slaves, Dany waits to see whether she will be greeted as a liberator or conqueror. (the writers try to get off the hook by acknowledging that she is aware of the difference). In fact, she gets a better deal  they claim her as their Mother. She ends up crowdsurfing over the brown people like some kind of Tagaryan Bono with all of the smug satisfaction of a gap-year backpacker that has just built an orphanage in a village somewhere.

Anyway. Its just a TV show, right?



ARE YOU CALLING ME A RACIST?  GAME OF TROPES PART 2

Wow. Apparently Daenerys Stormborns other title is Mother of Fandoms, since angry nerds across the world are telling me to STFU like I just insulted their mum.  Heres a Top 10 list of the things angry GoT fans have said to me about my first post, and my responses:

1. YOU HAVENT READ THE BOOKS!

Youre right. I have other stuff to do.

2. BUT ITS DIFFERENT IN THE BOOKS!

Good. I watched the TV show and my comments are about the TV show.

3. BUT IT DOESNT WORK OUT FOR DANY, YOULL SEE!!  THEYRE SUBVERTING THE TROPE!!

It doesnt matter if it works out for Dany or not.  This is not about whether she ultimately wins or loses (we know this show loves setting people up for a downfall)  its about the foreign cultures she encounters and her relationship to them.

If she learns a harsh lesson about how she cant win by liberating people it doesnt change the fact that the show clearly presents a central West and a foreign, exotic East with savage practices like slavery  clearly outlawed in Westeros.   Once again, the Other serves as a convenient prop piece for the journey and development of a white character, and we read and approve/disprove of their culture and practices through her eyes.

Failing to liberate/ unite/ save/ the Other in the East might be a harsh lesson in realism for Dany, but will not undo the fundamental dichotomy presented in GOT  a West that is roughly grounded in a culture and history we recognise, versus the savage, exotic Prince of Persia/ Aladdin fantasy theme park of the East.

Plot developments like that might question whether its possible to tame  savage and dangerous cultures  but not why people should be presented as savage or backwards in the first place  why there are such civilised vs uncivilised worlds in this universe to begin with.  Just like the material failure to liberate Iraq and Afghanistan in the face of a growing insurgency have not proven to the West that its notions of cultural supremacy are fundamentally flawed and racist from the outset.

Below: (1) Aint no party like a Dothraki wedding, AMIRITE? (2) some good old-fashioned arm-swinging, fire-dancing (3) NOM NOM NOM! Finger lickin good  personally, I prefer my stallion hearts medium rare (4) I WILL RAPE THEIR WOMEN! Whats not to love about this dude?  Such a romantic.

 



4. WHY DONT YOU TALK ABOUT SEXISM? GAME OF THRONES IS SUPER MISOGYNIST!

Really? The show where women get sold and hired and raped all the time?  And when people arent being raped, people are trying to rape them or threatening to rape them or talking about how they will probably be raped?  This show has more rape references per episode than an average season of Law and Order: SVU.  Pretty sure people have mentioned that already.  Still, GoTs approach to gender figures into its premises about race.

Despite the show basically celebrating rape through its casual, graphic fetishism, GoT attempts to construct a certain moral code around its characters attitudes towards sexual violence.  Danys evil brother touches her.  Joffrey, a villain, brutalises prostitutes, publicly has Sansa sexually humiliated, and threatens to rape her.  Tyrion demonstrates his nobility when he rescues Sansa from Joffrey, outright refuses his fathers orders to rape Sansa for the sake of an heir, and falls in love with Shae despite her being a prostitute and off limits to someone of his standing.  Brienne takes her revenge on three Stark soldiers who admit to raping a girl, and even Jaime Lannister gets a redemption story when he saves Brienne from getting raped by Locke and his men, at the cost of losing his hand.

Khal Drogo, on the other hand, casually rapes his wife on their wedding night and makes an epic speech pacing around a fire where he proudly claims that he will rape the women of Westeros while his troops cheer him on.  Rape is simply presented as an inherent, celebrated element of Dothraki culture.

5. IF YOU GO LOOKING FOR RACISM, YOU WILL FIND IT.

I have never gone looking for racism, racism finds me and slaps me in the face.  HOW DOES IT ALWAYS KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME?

6. ARE YOU CALLING ME RACIST FOR LIKING GAME OF THRONES?

I have no idea whether you are racist or not. But your violent reaction to me calling out some pretty obvious points about imaginary people on a FANTASY TV SHOW makes me wonder.

7. IN GAME OF THRONES, ALL CULTURES ARE SAVAGE AND EVERYONES A BARBARIAN.

Its true, in GoT almost all cultures go to war, everyone fights and people from all cultures are shown doing unsavoury things.  But not all barbarians are created equal.  Only certain cultures demand that a woman eat a raw stallion heart in front of people wailing in a made up language.  Only certain cultures allow and exist entirely on slave trading and slave-based economies.  Only certain cultures have violent sex orgies at their weddings, and only certain cultures sell armies of castrated brown warrior-eunuchs (the Unsullied).  And none of these things happen to be in Eurocentric Westeros.


8. WHAT ABOUT THE WILDLINGS?  ARENT THEY ALSO PORTRAYED AS BARBARIC?

The Wildlings are interesting.  Throughout the show we hear about them being everything from savages to bestiality loving cannibals, but when we finally meet them they turn out to be, wellregular white people in matching furry parkas.

White culture exists as a spectrum in the GOT universe; the Lannisters are the rich, entitled, aristocratic upper-class toffs, the Starks are the honest, hard-working aspiratonal middle class, and the Wildlings (and Hilltribes) are the working class.  The whole Jon Snow/ Ygritte storyline is as Disney as GoT gets with its nobleman-in-love-with-the-common-girl dynamic.  At one point they agree that they even come from the same ancestors, and question why they are fighting at all.

White people in GoT have an array of competing desires, internal conflict, and interesting moral issues to grapple with.  They come from different classes and backgrounds which inform their view of the world, creating believable relationships and interactions between characters. You know, like real people.

9. ITS JUST FANTASY!!

Fantasy reflects your subconscious desires.

I love the show and have watched it back numerous times, however, I'm a tad confused as to the relationships between some of the Lannister characters, specifically that of Tyrion + Cersei and Tyrion + Tywin. For starters, it's initially obvious that Tyrion and Cersei do not and never have gotten on very well (Cersei's comments about Tyrion killing her mother are testament to this) but she later opens up to him. They have a few heart to hearts, which makes me think that perhaps they've learned to like eachother a little. Maybe it's just empathy for the whole wedding situation, but I'm not sure.

And now for maybe the most confusing, Tyrion and Tywin. I'm REALLY not sure what to think about this. Tyrion seems to crack jokes with Tywin and whilst he does scrutinise his honour and tactics (specifically in S3E10), they seem to have a regular tone whenever they discuss things. I'm aware that Tyrion is consistently trying to earn his father's respect so this may be the reasoning. On Tywin's side though, I have no idea. He seems to respect Tyrion and realises his intelligence, often keeping him back to speak one-on-one whilst the rest of the people at the table leave. That said, he does seem to hate him for being a dwarf. I'm just really not sure.

If someone could clear this up for me, that'd be fantastic. Cheers and good day!",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Easy. Have a motorcycle khalasar. There would be a khal and there would be blood riders, khos, khaleesis, and we would get together like once or twice a year and take a trip. 

Rules
The first khal is the starter of the khalasar, (there would be multiple khalasars and such) and after he is either too old to ride or dies, or some other circumstance like moving for work, can't afford the trips, etc., a new khal would have to be a kho and would be voted in by the khos of the khalasar.

No fighting or violence within the khalasars or between two or more khalasars. The members who fought would be stripped of there kutts, and not allowed back in.

The khos would be chosen by the current khal for actions such as organizing a trip, or helping to keep the khalasar under control, etc., and the kho can only be stripped of rank if he is proven to be detrimental to the khalasar, or is caught in criminal activity.

The blood riders of the khal will be chosen by the khal and will ride beside the khal and follow out the khal's orders. If a new khal is reelected, the blood riders will still be able to ride, but will no longer hold the rank of blood riders, unless chosen by the new khal.

The khal cannot make any major or important decisions before consulting the council of khos. The council may also strip the khal of his status if he is found to be detrimental to the khalasar or caught in criminal activity.

If the khal feels he deserves to still be khal he can take it to the Council of the Khals. This council is made up of the former khals of the 8 biggest khalasars, and the khal must get approval of the trips beforehand by the Council of the Khals, and all khalasars must pay dues to the Council.



I know the idea needs a little work and refinement, but I was wanting to get a gauge of how many people would be interested in this kind of thing. If you have any suggestions, email me at tboccaccio@rocketmail.com and I will make another post titled [No Spoilers] Refined Rules and Regulations of the Dothraki Iron Riders

That being said, I made a connection not too long ago (right after I finished ASOS) when I was thinking back to all of those that died within those pages.

The Song of Ice And Fire series isn't about the happenings in Seven kingdoms of Westeros  or beyond the Wall, or across the sea in Essos. It's not about dragons, wars, king and queens, politics, or the ""Game of Thrones.""

By killing off so many major characters (especially fan favorites such as Ned and Robb) G.R.R.M. reminds us of our mortality. He shows that no matter how virtuous, evil, important, small, cunning, valiant, loved, or powerful an individual is we all die in the end.

This idea makes me appreciate Martin as an author that much more. And whatever his real reasons are for killing as many characters as he does, I applaud him for not copping out in his work and just ending the series with the fairy tale happy ending all new readers/watchers expect, and instead constantly throwing us for a loop and keeping us guessing. 

Thank you G.R.R.M. for killing Ned, and Robb and all the others, and in doing such showing us all that the ""hero"" of the story is mortal just like the rest of us average Joes.

Episode 8 of Season 2 is entitled ""The Prince of Winterfell"". As with most episodes of the series, it has a few meanings. The episode opens with ""Prince"" Theon meeting with his sister Yara in Winterfell's halls, and closes with Prince Bran hearing of the deaths of the Miller's boys. It's a good opening and closing for the episode.

There's one other scene that takes place in the episode, though: Robb and Talisa have sex. As we find out a little less than a season later, Talisa is with child. I don't know how far along she is, but by the time of the Red Wedding, she does seem to be visibly showing a bit.

I'm wondering if this was intentional, and Talisa's pregnancy being written into the show was planned from the get-go. It would add a bit of hindsight brilliance to the episode names. If anything, my head canon has Talisa being impregnated the first time she and Robb bang.

Of course, none of this really matters in the long run, since Talisa and Ned 2 were both stabby stabbed, and [ASOS](#b ""Jeyne Westerling isn't pregnant in the books, so the whole thing was just an added element anyway,"") but I thought it was a cool little tidbit.

-Melisandre kills the 'Usurper' Renly with a shadow assassin, created through sex with Stannis, the 'true' heir to Robert and therefore King.

-Robb Stark would as a result count as another Usurper to the throne. He also steadily isolates himself through selfish actions making himself vulnerable. These include breaking his oath to Walder Frey and beheading Rickard Karstark. The killing of Karstark is important as it firstly means he needs Walder Frey's army, leading to the Red Wedding. Secondly Robb does it against the council of his closest supporters due to being unable to swallow his pride at Rickard Karstark's insults towards him. We have already seen that a lack of pragmatism is a surefire way to failure when 'playing the Game of Thrones'.

-Melisandre repeatedly states that there is power in Kings blood, especially when referring to Gendry. This claim has already been shown to be truthful after the death of Renly. We therefore have no reason to believe that she is lying/reason to doubt that she can kill again with the use of King's blood, ie Gendry's blood.

-Melisandre takes Gendry's blood and Stannis burns the blood filled leeches on the brazier. When doing this, Stannis names the 3 Usurpers: Joffrey, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. These Usurper's, just like Renly name themselves King, however do not have as strong a claim as Stannis. As already shown we have no reason to doubt Melisandre's power or the power of King's blood.

- As a result of these events, it should have become clear that Robb Stark was doomed. The true shock is the nature of the Red Wedding, where Walder Frey commits a grave sin of killing guests at his home. Not only this but the juxtaposition with the happiness of a wedding. I thought the Episode was filmed absolutely brilliantly, and it was powerful for that very reason.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

I have been progressively sucked into the book more and more, the Bran assassination attempt chapter was amazing, the conversation between ~~Edward~~ Eddard and Cersei in the holy forest (I read Polish translation, not sure if this is its original name) was even better, then finally the chapter describing Stark's death blew me away. The hope Martin inspired by Littlefinger's promise, the anger caused by Queen tearing up the letter and the sadness caused by Baelish's words to Stark mixed up and exploded, leading to me putting the book away for a few seconds and looking at the ceiling wondering if there's any hope left for Seven Kingdoms and how dumb I was to not expect Littlefinger's treachery."")

My only complaint is that Daenerys's chapters have been a bit less interesting than the rest so far, but maybe only because she is only briefly connected to the main story."")

Looking forward to the TV series as well, I plan to start watching it once I'm done with the books because I want to avoid any and all spoilers. I know this whole post could be summed up with a slowpoke picture, but I was so impressed I felt the need to share it.

Who are all the characters that need to be introduced for this season? Who are characters that you want to be introduced that may not make the cut? Who are some actors you can see playing the upcoming characters?

Characters I definitely see being introduced:

- Dalla. I think we're going to get several expository Mance Rayder scenes next season, and who knows how important Mance's child will wind up being?

- Val. I love Val. She's got serious Wildling spunk. She'll be poised to be a bigger character in seasons to come, and I think that this is the first we'll see of her. 

- Bowen Marsh. There actually was a spear carrier Night's Watchmen in the first season who was apparently meant to be Bowen Marsh, but I imagine they'll go the Beric Dondarrion route with the character and recast him since Bowen plays a bigger role going forward.

- Dareon. Another Watchmen who gains a bigger role going forward. I think he'll be plugged into several scenes to give the viewers an impression of him. He's been mentioned several times in the show, such as a conversation between Sam and Gilly in Season 3.

- Cotter Pyke and Denys Mallister. They  really only factor onscreen in the LC election, but I'm hoping that plot is maintained strongly because Sam gets a seriously awesome plot in it.

Character that *may* be introduced:

- Satin: I don't know how big a role Satin will eventually play, but I like him as a minor supporting character.

- Styr: They had casting calls for the Magnar of Thenn, so Styr may be in the show playing a different kind of role, just as Orell was.

- Varamyr Sixskins: Varamyr's a nightmare from an animal training point of view, but he may come in as another of Mance's war troupe. 

- Donal Noye: I'm doubtful about this one, which disappoints me. Donal Noye was a great character in the books. I doubt they'll be able to flesh him out enough before his heroic death.

I'm wondering why Jaime Lannister is in the Kingsguard, it doesn't make sense to me at all.

The Lannisters are by far the richest family in Westeros.

Tywin Lannister only has 2 sons, and one of them is a dwarf he doesn't seem to particularly like.

As I understand it, by joining the Kingsguard, you are forbidden from taking a wife or inheriting land (similar to the Night's Watch).

So why would the richest man in Westeros be ok with his only able-bodied son joining the Kingsguard?

Where did they go in Season 3?

Surely they would be at the Wall by the end of Season 3?

Also, who is more South of whom? If the Nights Watch was South of the Wildling army, and the Undead army is there already (as they went past Sam), that means the Undead army is South of the Wildling army. If that's the case, why don't the Wildlings just follow slowly on after the Undead clear the South for them, and then move in? How could they possibly reach the wall before the Undead army?

Lastly... why is the Undead army even moving now at all, if they live in the cold lands, don't like fire, and winter is *still* coming? Wouldn't they start marching once the South is already winterised?

I feel I'm struggling a little with the Dorne story arc; many new characters were introduced quickly and I'm losing track of them all, and why the princess is doing what she's doing. I'm enjoying Brienne's story, but it just feels unbelievably slow, almost a completely different book. I try to imagine this as the TV show, and I feel I'd struggle to be engaged.

Does it get better? Do we get the excitement I've seen many times before, the drama of a plot twist mayhaps?

**Edit:** thanks for your info everyone! Seems like this may be a little slow going, but should definitely pick up interest with some of my favourite characters in A Dance with Dragons. I'll keep ploughing on!",25,0,False,self,,,,,

- The Mystery Knight (found in the Warriors Anthology)

So, GRRM borrows that strange portmanteau word ""riverrun"" to name the Tully's ancestral home, the very first word of the first sentence of one of the most famous works of Irish or any literature, Finnegan's Wake (""riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs."") Incidentally its also the last sentence of the book, reflects the circular nature of things, yadda yadda. To be sure ""riverrun"" is not a common word and all Joyce scholars' ears perk when they hear it because they know what comes after. As such I find it a nice nod from Martin to the literary past.

(A theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ijjfh/season_3_how_rich_are_the_lannisters_a_theory/,funkalunatic,1374126773,"My wild guess: The Lannisters are poor and their gold mines are mostly depleted. Evidence follows.

* Tywin's daddy Tytos had a rebellion to put down, lots of offspring to take a piece of his wealth, and was generally crap at governing.

* ""Hear me roar."" are the House words of the Lannisters. This implies that they rely on manipulating other people's perceptions of their strength rather than using the muscle and might they may or may not possess.

* Through the series and its history, the Lannisters have frequently appealed to power they did not have on hand. Lann the Clever, the mythical founder of the house, was a trickster, and gained Casterly Rock through trickery, probably by pretending he possessed power he did not. Tyrion used promises of gold to get out of the Eyrie's dungeons and avoid being mugged on the way out of the Vale. Jamie held up the idea of his powerful father as a shield and it got his hand chopped off.

* The Lannisters make a great deal of effort to project the image of their own wealth. Their armor is gilded apparently with gold. The saying ""A Lannister pays his debts"" is reinforced mostly by Lannisters saying it when they talk about how rich they are. They spend lavishly. An actually rich family would probably be misers.

* The Lannisters we have seen are either bad with money, or do not seem to possess the qualities that would make them good with it. Tyrion was a mediocre Master of Coin. Tywin apparently regarded that position as low, and just wanted Tyrion to find the damn money he needed. Jaime is generally impatient and rash, which are not qualities conducive to managing money and being rich. Cersei [da books](#b ""defaulted on a loan""), which brings me to...

* The indebted kingdom is on the verge of having a faceless man called on them even under Lannister governance! Wouldn't the Lannisters have been willing to extend the kingdom a greater part of their fortune if it meant not being assassinated?

* The Lannister's reputation for wealth has clearly been around for a while. Perhaps longer than the lifetime of your typical medieval goldmine. It seems to me that if they really did mine enough gold to support their spending for so many generations, it would have flooded the markets and gold would not be worth so much, and then they would not be so wealthy. Perhaps.

**Then how do the Lannisters not go broke?**

They loot, steal, and cheat. They don't pay their debts. When Tywin arrived in King's Landing at just the right moment at the end of Robert's rebellion, he sacked King's Landing, probably in lieu of paying wages to the army he brought there. Before that, he offed the Reynes and stole everything they had. (He probably owed both Aerys and the Reynes money.) And then he had a song written about it that he plays to get what he wants from other houses.

However, House Lannister is said to spawn from a hero named Lann, who during the age of heroes, out-smarted the Casterlies and took Possession of Castery Rock. So, I'm slightly confused as to why a house that existed only in Westeros had anestrial weapons residing in Valyria at the time of The Doom.

So House Tully and House Stark are both two of the eight great Houses of Westeros. Edmure have just become Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, Robb is Lord of Winterfell and King in the North. House Tully and House Stark are allies in the war of the five kings.

So why does it seem like Edmure is just another lord for another of Robb's vassal houses? He have to explain himself and his tactics to another lord of a great house, he gets bullied into decisions.

Would Mace Tyrell explain himself in the same way if the Tyrrels and the Starks were allies? I don't think so.

Is it just because Edmure is incompetent?",46,27,False,self,,,,,

What I don't understand is why the show (which generally gets MOST things right) would completely change a character's; name, background, family, implications of war/alliances.

With Jeyne, it implies that robb married her after she 'comforted him when he heard of Bran/Rickon's death' and also that her family (who were sworn to the lannisters) became a small new alliance.

With Talisa, she's a sexy nurse from a foreign slaver's country. He was chasing after her more than just some 'one night stand' sort of situation, and there was chemistry brewing for a number of episodes. 

So where the fuck did these discrepancies come from in between book to screen. I just don't understand why they did it this way? Generally speaking, in my experience so far, they have done a pretty good job of keeping things fairly parallel.

If I were a character in GoT, I'd probably be a lot like Sansa. She was raised to act the way she does! Also, her intentions are never bad I think she's a very pure and sweet character who unfortunately does not understand how to play any games, much less the Game of Thrones.

Honestly, I find her to be a perfectly likable girl. While she's not as magnetic as Daenerys Targaryen or Arya, I think she does the best she can and tries to be a good person. I think she's a lot like Ned in that aspect if she wanted to, she could probably play the Game. She's intelligent, charismatic (by that I mean she attracts a lot of sorta-positive attention from the other characters) and well-bred; however, she is a good person who wouldn't cause food shortages or kill others. I cannot picture Sansa killing *anyone* without extreme reasoning (e.g. this theoretical person raped and tortured her, burned alive her family in front of her, et cetera). 

Any thoughts? ",113,102,False,self,,,,,

After Renly died, Stannis pardoned all of Renly's bannerman who switched to his side. So then Stannis had all of his men, plus the 100,000 Renly had, so if the North joined Stannis a surrender would be even more likely, isn't that right?

Plus Ned is the one who informed Stannis that he was the rightful King, and stood by him. 

I know Stannis isn't supposed to be likable, but he's an honorable man and if Ned could respect him, then the North should as well. The reason most northmen want to secede is because of Joffery/Lannisters anyway, not because of Stannis Baratheon.",33,0,False,self,,,,,

Suffice to say, I'm totally hooked. Embarrassingly so. I also accidentally read a few spoilers on wiki and now I can't wait to see what happens next. (BTW thank you reddit for being so disciplined with spoiler alerts!) My question is, should I read the books?


**CONS**

*I don't have THAT much time, perhaps I should do more productive things (blasphemy!) 

*I don't have very much patience to read through long descriptions of landscapes or feasts without actually finding out WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

*I do enjoy being in the dark and then getting the ""full effect"" of watching the show and being surprised 





**PROS**

*I am a fairly fast reader and do tend to find time for things I love/am obsessed with :-)

*I don't know if I have enough patience to wait until March to see the show. I might end up wiki-ing all the spoilers and then regretting my lack of self control. 



-----------
If I were to start reading the books, I don't think I want to start with book one. Because even though, I know, I know, ""The books are SO MUCH BETTER!"" I really just want to know WHAT HAPPENS????? I will probably one day go back and read the entire series from start to finish, relishing every detail and learning about the history of Westeros and all the character backgrounds and foreshadowing. I love the detail. Right now, it's not that way yet. Right now, I just want to find out about awesome spoilers such as [all spoilers book and show] (#b ""Lady Stoneheart!!!!! OMFG!!!!!"")

I understand the vast prior history of the ""no killing your guest"" rule, but there was a war going on with several factions and it doesn't seem to match Robbs prior battle smarts to be so completely trusting--especially after he knew that he had crossed walder Frey.

He thought of it after reading book 4, but it was somewhat confirmed after reading DoD.  Please do not reveal the following if you do not want to see potential spoilers 

[warning WOW and Beyond](#g ""So let us first review what is known/suspected.  The first key fact that is slowly revealed in GoT is that Roberts Rebellion was started by Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapping/falling for Lyanna Stark.  She is believed to be held against her will, but that is never confirmed.  We just assume she was betrothed to Robert.  

This is the key to this theory;  What if Jon Snow is NOT the bastard son of Eddard Stark?  It is mentioned that Elia was a sickly creature and did not carry the favor of Rhaegar.  What if Lyanna willingly went with Rhaegar out of love.  When Kings Landing was sacked by Tywin Lannister, it is not mentioned HOW Lyanna was killed, but what if she died in child birth, the birth of Jon Snow.

So picture Eddard walking into the following situation, he just walked into a city expecting to save his sister or at least recover her remains.  Tywin Lannister just ordered for the murder of the last (thought to be) Targaryen heirs.  The son of his beloved sister would be a Targaryen heir as well.  If revealed the son would die.  There is only one person who could dare know a secret this huge.  What if Vary's offered the child's life in exchange for his.  For the love Eddard had for his sister, he took the massive blow to his otherwise unflappable honor. 
But what does this mean?  It means Jon Snow is a Targaryen and has the blood of the dragon in him.  He is meant to marry Daenerys and ride her Dragons with her.  Oh, but Jon Snow is a brother of the nights watch and there is that whole thing that he is... well stabbed to death at the wall near the end of DoD.  Who else is at the wall, but the Red Lady a priestess to R'hllor, who has been known to bring people back from the dead.  Also, Jon's death admonishes him from his duty as a man of the nights watch.  He pledged himself to the position to death and with death he becomes free again.

That is the end of the theory.  I hope whomever reads this was as mind-blown as I was when my brother explained it to me.  Feel free to debate! "")",0,1,False,default,,,,,

What if Lyanna willingly went with Rhaegar out of love. When Kings Landing was sacked by Tywin Lannister, it is not mentioned HOW Lyanna was killed, but what if she died in child birth, the birth of Jon Snow.

So picture Eddard walking into the following situation, he just walked into a city expecting to save his sister or at least recover her remains. Tywin Lannister just ordered for the murder of the last (thought to be) Targaryen heirs. The son of his beloved sister would be a Targaryen heir as well. If revealed the son would die. There is only one person who could dare know a secret this huge. What if Vary's offered the child's life in exchange for his. For the love Eddard had for his sister, he took the massive blow to his otherwise unflappable honor. But what does this mean? It means Jon Snow is a Targaryen and has the blood of the dragon in him. He is meant to marry Daenerys and ride her Dragons with her. Oh, but Jon Snow is a brother of the nights watch and there is that whole thing that he is... well stabbed to death at the wall near the end of DoD. Who else is at the wall, but the Red Lady a priestess to R'hllor, who has been known to bring people back from the dead. Also, Jon's death admonishes him from his duty as a man of the nights watch. He pledged himself to the position to death and with death he becomes free again.

That is the end of the theory. I hope whomever reads this was as mind-blown as I was when my brother explained it to me. Feel free to debate! "")

GRRM would not in any way be adapting the tv show writer's vision after the fact, but would finish the novels as he originally intended on his own, giving him the time he needs while simultaneously giving these other writers that he's grown to love, respect and trust, to create their own vision (which they have already been doing, the show isn't a strict retelling of the novels scene by scene), with him as final editor and final say.  It would be an interesting and unique writing artistic venture, one that borders on experimental, but will give a fresh and fitting conclusion to this story.

It would be revolutionary, and here's why.  You have tv series based on books and you have book adaptations made from tv series (expanded universe type stuff), the latter being seen as mostly inferior to the former.  At that point, you have two fans: those who read the book first, and those who started with the tv series and either read the books after or just stick with the tv.

But have you ever had a tv show that was made from a previous source where the fanbase already knows what is happening, and then 3/4 the way through, you have the book fanbase and the tv fanbase both caught up, and then you have the author postpone release of the finished books until AFTER the show ""adapts"" (from outline) the unpublished work?

The book fans would get the unique and thrilling experience that us tv show fans have had throughout these 3 seasons, of experiencing the revelation of story on the screen.  Also, this gives us tv fans a respite against the numerous zealous spoiler threads.

Also, this will give the diehard book fans the other unique opportunity to experience the tv series first and then go back and fill in all the detail, emotion and epic saga that only books can deliver!  And it would most assuredly be a build up to a much higher quality work (tv series adaptation ---&gt; original source novel).  

Who hasn't first been a fan of a show or movie adaptation and absolutely fallen in love again with the story when being able to discover the true depths the original source novel can give.

Honestly, I think it would be a special gift to the fans of both the books and the show to be able to watch in suspense the final seasons of GOT, and then being given the off season release of the novels to gain a deeper appreciation and help with the torturous waiting!",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Gonna post this here as well as r/ASOIAF to get opinions from both communities.  Though be aware the post over there I will attach a ""Spiolers All"" tag, whereas I'm limiting it to show spoilers here.

Before I begin, I want to say that this is not intended to be a books vs show debate. Though the subject matter will deal with an adaptations relation to the source material, I do not wish for this to devolve into that sort of discussion.  I also plan on discussion of the nature of spoilers in one medium vs another and the fandom's approach to spoilers, please note and abide by the marked tag. (Ironically which will be relevant to a later point.  I also plan on discussing other stories (Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit/Harry Potter/ Dark Tower...etc) and while I won't go into major spoilers for those works of literature and film, please be curious to others and mark those with tags as well...so let's begin.

A curious thing I think we'be all noticed regarding the ""A Song of Ice and Fire""(asoiaf) novels and it's adaptation ""Game of Thrones"" is the general attitude of how spoilers should be approached by fans of this world and of the show and/or books.  This approach that I'm talking about is that when discussing the books or the show you should approach discussion under the assumption ""that the person has not read the books, or has not read past the point where the adaptation currently stands"", that when discussing this series and discussion turns to the books you have to check whether or not a person has read or not.  

And I'm not just talking about the state of things here on reddit (actually both r/gameofthrones and r/asoiaf have eximplary spoiler guidelines), but among the fandom's at a whole, so extending this discussion to YouTube, podcasting, late night talk shows, fan conferences... Etc any place wherein discussion could take place.  

The thing is however, I've only noticed this with ASOIAF and Game of Thrones.  This approach I honestly cannot remember happening or being an issue with any other fandom in regards to a book(or book series) and it's adaptation.  In any other fandom the ""standard"" regarding spoiler discussion among fans in any type of forum being the assumption that people ""HAVE read the source material"" and anything is open game.  Or at least it's not a huge taboo to discuss a spoiler that has not yet been covered by it's respective adaptation.  

Th big one that comes to mind is Harry Potter.  In any forum, whether it was online comment threads, podcasts, or message boards the assumption was that if you were participating in that community, you had read the books.  And if you were a movie only person, it was your own fault if you got spoiled on certain aspects of plot ahead of time... That ""you should have read the books"" was commonplace.  

And it's not only Potter, but almost every other fandom I can think of that goes along those same lines.  I don't remember huge negative reactions to spoilers ahead of The Lord of Rings films, granted the Internet is much different and much more populus now than it was on 2002, but I don't see the same level of outlook on spoilers even for the Hobbit, who adaptations are currently coming out.  I don't think if I went to a fan convention and struck up a conversation with someone about how [Spoilers The Hobbit](#b ""I can't wait for Gandalf to discover The Necromancer is really Sauron, or how epic the battle of the five armies will be""), that it would cause any fuss. (Even if I left that previous sentence untagged, eh?).  But, if I go to another convention and start talking about how I can't wait to see [ASOS and ADWD](#b ""The massive battle at the Wall, or Tyrion's travels across Essos""), I do not think it would be a second before someone who accidentally overheard my conversation pounced on me.  I am not, nor was ever the target demographic (26 year old male here) for the Twilight series, or The Hunger Games, so not too sure on this one, but was it the same in those communities?  Did the people who read the books first acquiesce to non readers and check their discussion at the door? 

Non-series books and comics are not immune. I don't remember large uproars and moderation for ""The Watchmen"" or ""Sin City"" when they came out for spoilers online....  Is there gonna be an expectation that viewers have already read ""50 shades of Grey"" when it's eventual adaptation comes out.

So does there exist a double standard when discussing ASOIAF and Game of Thrones online, in person, or in the media that we assume that people have not experienced the source material first before the adaptation.  When it's clear that most other relationships of the same nature are not held to that same standard?  And if it does, then why? Why do we tread on the thin ice of spoilers regarding Game of Thrones, when we didn't for Harry Potter? And lastly, will this shape how fandoms approach Source Material/Adaptation relationships going forward?

The Why is easy, this fandom largely consists of fans who discovered the series through the show, and then have or have not went on to discover the books.  The people who discovered the books years before the show, or have since went on to read the all the books since starting the show is still in the large minority.  This was not the case with Harry Potter, as most people in that fandom had read the books years before the individual movies came out...  I think this could shift however, as more and more people get interested in this series I see that more and more people delve into the ASOIAF novels (you need to only look at the sheer number of ""just finished reading"" or pictures of text posts here in reddit as proof of that).  But will this community ever make that full shift to where most people have read all published books?  Perhaps, maybe when The Winds of Winter is released we might see that happen, but who knows, but it would be interesting to see that paradigm shift.

Could it be the gap between publication and adaptation?  Even considering that A Game of Thrones was published in 1996, you have to note that ASOIAF is fairly recent for an adaptation, especially since the source material is currently ongoing.  This is not the case with something like The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit where the full story has been out there for 40-80 years respectively, and the adaptation was not made until decades later?

The Internet is also largely a factor into why... I touched on it earlier, but the way we discuss what we're fans of, and how we react with one another is much different as even recent as a decade ago.  YouTube comments sections, and reddit were a thing of the future in the early 2000s when the LOTR and the first few HP films were released... Wheras season 1 of Game of Thrones came out in this, our golden era of social and online interaction....Does that play a large part?

That last question is also interesting, has how the ASOIAF/GoT approached discussion of the material effect how other source material/adaptation relationships be handled by their respective fandoms in the future?  I can't help but think of the Dark Tower adaptation that has been on again/off again for the past couple of years... Should that ever come about, and say that it's well done and can pull in the people, I can see it being approached the same way ASOIAF/GoT is approached regarding discussions that involve spoilers.  I think if that were to happen the assumption among that community would be that most people have not read the Dark Tower series and the majority of this hypothetical fan community would be show or movie people.  And I expect with how the Internet and social media has grown over the past decade, that this approach is now a standard.  

Well, those are my observations, I'd like some feedback if you care to leave a responce, and until next time.... Take care",8,18,False,self,,,,,

My personal opinion: I go with the theory that Jon's parents are Lyanna Stark and Rheagar Targaryen. Lyanna wasn't actually kidnapped by him but in fact ran off with him &amp; was secretly married, making Jon snow a legitimate candidate for the iron throne. The promise Lyanna made Ned promise her (in her ""bed of blood"") was that he must keep Jon a secret, in case Robert baratheon would kill in because of what she did and the fact he was Targaryen.The main evidence I hold for this theory is that the 3 Kingsgaurd, arguably the best 3, missed out on the battle of the trident, the sack of kings landing(admittedly they didn't know it would happen but weren't with their king all the same) and the siege of storms end, the only reason that they'd miss those majorly important parts of the war to defend the iron throne would be to protect the next heir to the iron throne, Jon, under rheagars orders! Why else would they be there? Now speaking in terms of the ending of the last book ADWD, the only person who could know the absolute truth of this is Howland reed, as he is the only survivor from the tower of joy battle between the 7 nights headed by Ned stark versus the 3 Kingsgaurd. Another possible person that could know the truth is the greenseer that bran is with in the cave if the children of the Forest, he might have seen ned praying to his heart tree about his troubles with keeping the secret or whatever. Also, Jon snow has seemingly been murdered, or at least stabbed so many times that he could have definitely died from the wounds, this is very important IMHO, as because he was in the night's watch, he would have had no claim to the throne as being a measter. But now that he is dead, he has fulfilled his vows and served until death, so if melisandre brings him Back to life as other red priests have been known to do (thoros of myr) Jon will have his claim to the throne! (And Winterfell maybe, in the eyes of the northern lords other than manderly who knows the truth of bran and rickon) But he still Wouldn't know about It until someone tells him, so I think it comes down the howland reed! Anyway that's my two cents, I'd love to hear what you guys have to say about it!",7,0,False,self,,,,,

To be precise, it's the episode where Theon burned two children who he believed were Bran and Rickon. Yet in the same ep, Jaime brutally kills his cousin to escape. What's interesting is the sentence that Cat told him afterwards ""You are a man without honor', which now puts us in difficult dilenma: Who is the person responsible for the title? To most people Theon obviously has less honour and its his sin that ended the episode, but BOTH of them assaulted children and it's Jaime who gets the exact line thrown in his face.

Now similar thing happened in S3E3 ""Walk of Punishment"", where we get the exact line delivered in Astapor as explanation to the hanging, tortured slaves. Yet the same episode finishes with Jaime getting his hand chopped off. Now it might be pretty straightforward: The line appeared as a decoy, but the true, symbolic meaning was that Kingslayer began his journey to atone for every wicked thing he's done. But then again, seeing the 'Walk of Punishment' had most likely huge impact on Dany, and eventually resulting in her crowdsurfing on slaves calling her mother, it could be just that.

Now when we look back to S1E1 ""Winter is Coming"", I think it's when the whole double-meaning thing starts. On one hand we've got Wights' appearance, on the other war is just around the corner. This one time I think it's certain that they used it for both; as the Stark words themselves have both symbolic and obvious meaning.

What do you think about these? Could it be a clever trick to hint two separate characters/events at once, or is it an actual feinting technique, making one obvious when it's the other? Is there more of this? I'm especially curious about 'The Pointy End' and 'Baelor', these two make me go 'Okay I know what these things refer to' but then again they could have much deeper meaning that I missed!

**EDIT:** Okay, it seems like most people agree that it's a technique where they try to fit as many events under single episode title as they can. I suppose this makes the most sense. Also great finds in the comments! Thanks for pointing these out.",21,11,False,self,,,,,

Did Roose divulge the entire plan to him after their conversation with Brienne and now Jamie is leaving happy knowing what lies ahead for the starks?

I have just finished ASOS, and she still seems like the childish, bad liar, afraid little girl that she was from the start - the way she believed that Sir Dontos was ""her Florient"" was SO frustratingly naive and dumb - it's been THREE BOOKS. Her father, brother and mother are dead, she's almost been raped, her Prince abused her over and over again...Nope, still looking for her knight in shining armor. More than halfway into the series and she's done nothing and not changed a bit. It just feels like her chapters are a waste of space.

I've seen her story arc over the 5 books described as ""a young girl turning jaded and on her way to start doing great things""...but Arya accomplished that same change in the first book, what's taking her SO LONG ?

In comparison, Jon is Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Arya is a badass on her way to become an even bigger badass, and Bran warged into another human being. 

Meanwhile, Sansa's making snow castles. ",13,0,False,self,,,,,

So in the show it is strongly implied that Theon is castrated by Ramsay, an important bit of information which was not made explicit in the books to the best of my knowledge.  Was this fact revealed in the books without my realization or was it something added to the show?  I suppose you could see the references to him being subhuman (or ""not a man"") as an allusion to this fact, and Theon leaves it out when he describes his injuries after having been tortured.

I kind of see it as being similar to the scene added to the show of Varys and the wizard in the box who castrated HIM.  I guess it's just odd that the show is adding a lot more of castration backstory that wasn't in the books.  Shit, I'm not even sure they tell us that Daenerys' Unsullied are eunuchs.

I am almost done with ACOK (Chapeter 66/72) and its been very apparent that it was much different from the show. Which I am fine with, most time after I see a great movie or show that was based on a book, I read that book. So Game of Thrones was no different..... at first..... Now I just cant get enough but one question has been fucking with my head.

My question is for you book readers. Did knowing the book before hand ruin the show? 

I want to take in as much Song of Ice and Fire that I can but I dont want to ruin the awesomeness of the show either. My real life friends are all into it also but most of em are either still in AGOT or just started ACOK and im getting close to starting ASOS. I have real life friends who will know it also but I am tearing through the books at a faster pace then them and dont want to be left with no one with no one to talk to and be ""that guy"" who knows the show before it happens.

UNLESS...........

You book readers tell me true...... that its worth it or not.......


***UPDATE 7/25***

On chap 69/72 of ACOK 

Thank you all for that, this is JUST what I was looking for. I will continue to read, my goal is to try and have them all the books done by the time GoT S04 starts. ",45,20,False,self,,,,,

Most readers will be able to tell you about the **Dunk and Egg** novellas of which 3 out of a possible 9 have been published so far. The story of these novellas follows Duncan the Tall and Egg (nickname) and the adventures they have together. The style is very different from the main story, and more reminiscent of tales of King Arthur and his knight of the round table; however, it is a very good read.

[The Tales of Dunk and Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Dunk_and_Egg) can be found as a part of the anthologies they were published in (Legends, Legends II, and Warriors, respectively). There are also comic book versions of these, but until the reprints come out, you will have a very hard time getting a hold of them.

Now what most readers wont be able to tell you about is **The Iron Throne Saga**. This is an unofficial name given to the novellas that GRRM published in scifi/fantasy magazines before including them as part of the main series. The great thing about these is that they will give you an insight into the world of the show, a taste of the author's writing, and contain a full story arc of a more focused nature. There are three of these so far:

* ""[Blood of the Dragon](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Blood_of_the_Dragon)"" follows Daenery's story in A Game of Thrones/first season of the show.

* ""[Path of the Dragon](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Path_of_the_Dragon)"" follows her quest in A Storm of Swords/third and fourth seasons of the show.

* ""[Arms of the Kraken](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arms_of_the_Kraken)"" contains the four Iron Islands chapters in A Feast for Crows/possible 4th season material. (You would be able to read this without ruining most of the storyline in the show since it really just focuses on the ironborn and ignores the heart of King's Landing, but as always read at your own risk).

I tried to find somewhere to read these stories as they are, but unless you have a copy of the issues they were printed in, it's highly unlikely to do so. You can, however, always just borrow the needed books and follow the chapter suggestions. Maybe, someone skilled at making an ebook would be able to conjure one up, but that might be a copyright thing, so idk. I did, however, find someone's concept for cover art of ""[The Iron Throne Saga](http://galacticespionage.tumblr.com/post/56362734777/thesilentrogue-had-a-little-time-to)"" (which is where I got the name from.

Anyways, yeah. My suggestion is to try reading either of these novella sets if you can't read all the works but still want a taste of the writing.

Arya is blind, Jaime isn't Tywin's son and kind of abandoned Cersei, Cersei is locked up by the High Septon, Sam met with the peeps from the prologue in Oldtown, the biker-dude Maester is off to find Daenerys, Littlefinger is a fucking genius (hopefully this all ends well for Sansa/Alayne), Brienne is dead, Catelyn Stark is a psycho zombie bitch, and Euron Greyjoy can (potentially) CONTROL DRAGONS? I didn't get any of that wrong, did I? Did I miss anything? 
Holy jesus fucking christ. 

I can't wait to start ADWD, but I must say that I am quite intimidated by its size.

Sorry about the rant. I don't know many people that have read all the books, so I've gotta find people to rant to!",19,0,False,default,,,,,

So I wanted to do a post where I could talk about them and people could voice their opinions on them.

* Robb has **Greywind**, named for it's speed and strength, Robb takes him in to battles during his rebellion where the wolf was seen to kill a dozen horses in a single battle. Greywind was slain at the Twins in the Red Wedding, though before, the wolf snarled at the Freys, sensing their intent.

* Jon has **Ghost**, named for it's white fur and silence (said to be without a voice). Though when Jon found him, he was thought to be the runt of the litter, from what I can tell, Ghost's size was no different to the others. Ghost is albino, pure white with red eyes, Jon finds this interesting due to it's similarities to a weirwood of the old gods. Jon has a strong warg connection with Ghost however he is unable to skinchange at will.

* Bran has **Summer**, Bran was last to name his wolf but the name came to him during his coma. Summer is said to be the smartest of the litter, Jojen also comments that he is 'stronger than he knows'. Bran has a very strong warg connection with Summer and can skinchange at will.

* Rickon has **Shaggydog**, called Shaggy for short, he is totally black with green eyes, he is very aggressive and quick tempered due to Rickon's tantrums in which Shaggy has been know to attack the people who cause Rickon's distress. Dispute this, he is perfectly loyal and very protective of Rickon. Jojen describes him as 'full of fear'.

* Arya has **Nymeria**, said to be as wild Arya, she was forced to send Nymeria away after the wolf attacked Joffery to defend Ayra. After running away, she became the leader of a huge pack of wolfs around the God's Eye, despite this Arya still dreams through Nymeria's eyes.

* Sansa had **Lady**, Sansa thought her good-natured and well behaved, however Ned Stark was forced to kill her by order of the King at Castle Darry after Nymeria attacked Joffery. Ned then ordered her bones to be buried at Winterfell.

I hope this helped clarify some details or help explain the details for the non-readers",40,41,False,self,,,,,

Moreso than AGOT/ACOK/ASOS?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1j1p05/spoilers_all_im_one_of_those_who_found_affcadwd_a/,qp0n,1374779992,"I know I'm getting way ahead of myself, yeah yeah, but it's July, Season 4 is *9 months away*, and speculation passes the time.

Been a while since I read AFFC/ADWD and only read them once (supposedly they're much better on 2nd reading), but from faint memory the reasons I'm so excited to see seasons 5-6/7 are:

* **Victarion Greyjoy** - One of the best characters in the series, fills the 'physically imposing moral hero' void in the show (well, relatively speaking that is) ... but most of all, his character miraculously ""pulls a Jaime"" by quasi-redeeming the house of Greyjoy which had seemed like nothing but a fringe, rebellious, unlikable hoard of dirtbags before he arrived.

* **Euron Greyjoy** - My personal favorite character in the entire series. Don't know why, he isn't present much at all and he is generally a sadistic fuck... [but I can't help but picturing him as Mads Mikkelson](http://cdn.bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/VahallaRising2_Mads-Mikkelsen.jpg) acting all mysteriously terrifying &amp; cunning. If cast/acted right I hope the writers take some liberties to expand his characters scenes (unfortunately I don't expect such a highend actor like Mads to be cast).

* **Tyrion out of his element** - seriously can't have enough Tyrion, and the predicaments he is thrust into are ripe for some epic Dinklage.

* **Drogon crashing the gladiator arena** - The shocking scenes of the Stark deaths were perfect but more drama than action, and the Unsullied acquisition was great... but I honestly believe the Drogon massacre could be one of if not the best scene from the first 5 books if done right. The way it played out in my head seemed like it was made to be turned into epic TV action. 

* **That Manderly reveal** - ""The north remembers, and the mummer's farce is almost done."" ... quote always gives me chills.

* **Arya's entire arc** - The Braavos arc was what made Arya my 2nd favorite character. Can't wait to see it on screen.

* **Dorne at last** - Some didn't like these chapters, I loved em. But mainly what excites me is to see this show filmed in such a new environment/landscape. I think ['Kingdom of Heaven'](http://www.silverwhistle.co.uk/knightlife/knightpics/BaudouininStudy.jpg) every time I picture that whole storyline. Also, Doran Martell is such an awesome enigmatic character.

Overall, I think one of the main reasons people didn't like AFFC/ADWD - the diversion away from fan favorite characters to strange new arcs - will actually translate to being an advantage for the show. If the series instead had went on season after season in familiar Westeros territory where winter still hadn't arrived, the WW still hadn't gone anywhere, and Dany is still lollygagging around Essos rather than actually using her army to finally 'take what is hers with fire and blood' ... then the show could actually wear itself out with anticipation. But by introducing these radically different settings &amp; characters the TV show can keep things fresh while we all wait on that inevitable, ominous ""ice and fire"".",8,6,False,self,,,,,

I don't think the big moment the Mountain has this season is suited to him.

The man may be very tall but he does not have the build the Mountain needs and also he lacks the intimidation factor.

The [previous Mountain](http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x38/Majonga/Alliance%20and%20IH%20Games/ASoIaF%20IH%20House%20Lannister%20Faction%20and%20Battles/Clegane.jpg) displayed all of the Mountain's qualities perfectly. He presented the ferocity, brutality, evilness and animal nature the character has with almost no flaw.
He also was built like a wrestler and was even taller than Whyte.
He even **looks** like the untold brother of the show's [Sandor Clegane](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/21800000/The-Brothers-Clegane-game-of-thrones-21892649-624-701.png) instead of [Whyte](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120531221810/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Gregor_2x08.png) looking almost nothing Sandor and more like his uncle.

It would be a shame if they couldn't get [**Conan Stevens**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qTfDfYQIkjc/UG0JxFzzX_I/AAAAAAAAAms/Y9dkcFPgqeI/s320/cscrop.png) back, it really would.

So even if they can't get Stevens then I'd suggest they pursue other options than just Whyte.

*My* suggestion would be [**Robert Maillet**](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537631/resumephotos). 
The man is almost perfect for the role and just as good as Stevens in my opinion.
He may not be as tall as either Whyte or Stevens(though close, the difference is only 10's of centimetre's) he still seems like a giant. He is built and has that thick posture about him. 
He looks like an absolute brute and share similarities with the facial ferocity Steven's has.
He also looks like the Hound's brother which is very important. 
He is a suitable replacement to Steven's, much moreso than Whyte.

I don't want to seem hard on Whyte but I'm just not satisfied with him as the Mountain. He has done some excellent work in the past (Prometheus, Aliens Vs Predator and the White Walker) but I just don't think he is right for the part. 

I want the role of the Mountain AND the scenes he will be in this season to be done justice. 

TLDR; Whyte out, Stevens or Maillet in.

Season I was probably the most loyal to the books, and the smaller cast of characters meant that individual characters got more focus than they do in the later seasons. However, at times the 'sexposition' got a bit much (the scene with Lord Baelish and two of his whores, for example). 

Season II benefited from an increased budget, and to me it felt like the most focused season; the entire season felt as though it was building up to Blackwater, whereas much of the first season was, by necessity, given over to worldbuilding. This season also had some major departures from the books. Some of them worked, in particular having Tywin and Arya meet in Harrenhal. Some of them were by necessity, such as toning down Blackwater. Some of them didn't work though, in particular Daenerys' story in Qarth.

Season III boasted, I think, the highest production values and a greater CGI quality than the previous seasons. In fact, season III had some of the best CGI I've ever seen in any TV show. I think this helped bring Westeros to life in a way that the previous seasons struggled to do; at times, the first season felt like a bunch of characters walking around sets, but in this season it really felt as though these characters were in another world. There were again departures from the books, many of which didn't work: I'm not a fan of Stannis' portrayal in the show, and I think they overdid Theon's scenes this season. I like that they expanded Robb's role in the show, although it did feel like he was wandering aimlessly around the Riverlands with his army at times, whereas in the books his movements made more sense.

Overall though, I think season III has been my favourite so far. *A Storm of Swords* is filled with moments that I love, and the show brought them to life brilliantly. Jaime losing his hand, Daenerys 'buying' her army, and the Red Wedding were particular highlights. Lady Olenna was also fantastic.",16,16,False,self,,,,,

You break all family ties, you renounce your claims to power and so on and so forth. This would have effectively allowed him to relinquish his right to the throne and not also have to take the black and put himself in harms way which sounds more like the Sam decision.

Now that the season is over and I'm in a lull in AFFC, I've been watching other shows. So many writers seem afraid to kill their characters. You make it to the end of a drama, and sometimes characters have ""died,"" but it's later revealed that they secretly escaped a murder attempt, or they were in hiding, or some other plot device saved a character from death. It really cheapens the story. So-and-so was never in any real danger after all, so who cares if he or she made some heroic sacrifice?

What I'm trying to say is this. A lot of people say GRRM fucks with his audience by building characters into lovable people and then killing them. But I say other writers fuck with us. They lead us into thinking a character is in danger, when we really never had anything to worry about from the beginning.

Am I alone in thinking this?

EDIT: Maybe I didn't think enough before posting. I didn't mean to say that GRRM is the only person ever to kill characters. Of course other writers will do it. I just meant that there aren't many mainstream programs that will kill off characters when the audience really cares about them. That doesn't mean their stories are bad.

I blew through ASOS in five days, and I'm looking at three times that for half of AFFC. 

I enjoy the Jaime chapters, just because he's one of my favorite characters. I'm kinda liking the development of Sansa/Alayne, Arya is pretty good so far, but otherwise I'm bored to tears. The ironborn and dornish are very uninteresting to me, Samwell's is ok, Brienne's is very slow, and all I want to do is tell Cersei to stfu, she's just pointlessly scheming it seems like.

Does it pick up? Do I just accept this book as a drawn out book of character development? Is ADWD just as slow?

EDIT: to give a better point of reference to where I am in the book, [Cersei and her litter are going to see the new High Septon](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_28).

* 40-50 students

* 3-4 floors

* guys and gals

* all first years

* $40 budget

* minimum: each student needs a personalized door tag and I need to have one event night per week (this can even be something very small, like cupcakes in my room)

I was thinking I would do a different house/area for each floor; Dothraki Sea, Westeros, Free Cities or Targaryean, Stark, Lannister, Martells, you get the picture. I could do all the signage (I have loads of signs and posters and bulletin boards I could label) in Dothraki or Valyrian, theme nights with GRRM recipes, etc

So much crazy shit happens, and it is so well written. I cant wait for it to be adapted to screen for season 4, and I'm really glad they decided to break it up into two seasons. 

Favorite death was definitely Tywin. I loved that chapter not cause of the fact he died (I liked his character quite a bit) but because Tyrion was just being his most bad-ass self and was done with that shit!

least favorite was probably the hound (although i guess it never explicitly states ""hes dead"" but is rather implied). I feel like there should have been a more fitting end for him, seeing as how unruly his character is, but who knows, maybe he lives on.

my only *real* complaint was the literal dues ex machina with catelyn in the epilogue, but only cause i dislike her character. At least she cant speak! 

I love ASOIF.

They are huge warriors

They are prodigiously powerful and seem to take hits pretty well

They are not very intelligent

They are the best at what they do - what they do is battle, pillage, rape, and burn.

They hate their brother

They have killed their wife. (I believe Gregor did that, or at least killed many women in his castle)

I'll start with a few I came up with:

After the untimely death of his brother-in-law, a pessimistic father becomes obsessed with climate change and uproots his family in search of more meaningful work.

A pampered, naive teenage girl has an unlikely romance with the leader of a violent local gang.

A dashing young soldier must choose between romance and duty when a reconnaissance mission leads to him falling in love with a beautiful insurgent.

A feisty, determined widow must stick her neck out to try and keep the rest of her grieving family together. 

Join a spunky teenage girl, her best friends and her three magical pets on an exciting journey across a fantastical land!

An ugly but kindhearted aristocrat must use his legendary wit to woo the bashful lady he plans to marry  but could an old flame get in the way?

A shy, bumbling teenage boy wants to lose his virginity and fast. But when his friends introduce him to a houseful of hot, experienced girls, he might wind up with more than he bargained for.

Are there any other Redditors can think of? Sam and Jon buddy comedy, hardboiled detective Ned, Downton-esque intrigue involving the Tyrells,
Dany's dealings with MMD as some sort of Christian anti-abortion fable, that Jamie and Brienne spinoff sitcom everyone would love to watch...

* what happens in the last chapter? the last sentence of the entire book was ""I'm the pig boy"". Really? that's it? I went back to the prologue and read the parts about the candle and the alchemist again....but that didn't really shed any light on what really happens with Samwell.....usually the books end with a giant cliffhanger - am I just too stupid to realize where the cliffhanger is in this book? it didn't really seem like an ending to a book. I still don't understand the deal with the candle that doesn't flicker.

* who was the woman that jaime saw in his....'dream'? his mother? apparently it wasn't a dream, because he only had 1 hands...?

* what was the point of Brienne's character to begin with? it seems to be me, that she didn't really accomplish anything in the entire book-series. she was suppose to rescue sansa and arya, then she got into captivity, then she went to kings landing with jaime - then tried to do it again, then she got killed. the end. ......Is she really dead? the last sentence of her chapter was ""She screamed a word."" what is that suppose to mean? that she reconsidered and now is going to kill Jaime? Or maybe she's just dead and the brotherhood brings her back to life again? it was rather vague

* what was up with Dorne? the iron island chapters made sense because they had progress (the crow's eye became the new king of the iron islands, and they have the horn to control the dragons) .....but the dorne-chapters didn't make any progress at all. Arianne planned to raise Myrcella as queen - but ultimately failed - end of story. Everything else in the last dorn-chapter was rather vague.....(she was promised to marry someone ...who is dead.....okay?!)

* why was Sam even in Braavos? he was on the way to Old Town (which is located in the south west of westeros....why did they even make stop in Braavos?

* what happened with arya? we still don't really know anything about the faceless 'club' that she joined, do we? The last chapter doesn't even refer to her as 'arya' but as 'cat of the canals' (which I assume is suppose to mean that she isn't really Arya Stark anymore, but 'a shadow') but....was that it? what is she doing? she's still just 'training' in braavos? what ultimately happens to her at the end of the book? nothing?

I'm somewhat upset after reading this book, because nothing really happens......only Jaime's and Cersei's storylines had some actual progress....they had an ending.

the other storylines all seem so unfinished. And since none of those characters are going to have (a major?) role in dance with dragons, I don't think that we'll find out more about them until Winds of Winter

or maybe there is just a lot of subtext in this book that I can only understand after reading DWD?",30,0,False,self,,,,,

I was browsing a online book store and they sell book 5 without being split (sorry portuguese site): http://www.wook.pt/ficha/a-dance-with-dragons/a/id/11920262 and its around 970 pages.

They also sell the 2 parts:
http://www.wook.pt/ficha/a-dance-with-dragons-dreams-and-dust/a/id/12162173 around 590 pages
http://www.wook.pt/ficha/a-dance-with-dragons-after-the-feast/a/id/12162174 around 700 pages

Now, 700 + 590 = 1290. The other book had only 970 pages. What am I missing? Is the unsplited book the same? is there even a unsplited book? What about book 3, is there an unsplited version?

Also, where in the books is the series around? I want to start the series but I want to read the books first. Thank you in advance",4,0,False,self,,,,,
