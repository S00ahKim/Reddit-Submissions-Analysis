9,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-12-1,2015,12,1,19,3uzg6c,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] Who knows the truth about a certain character?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3uzg6c/all_spoilers_who_knows_the_truth_about_a_certain/,---__-_--__----_-_--,1448967248,"I've been thinking about this for a while and realised that a lot of characters (in the show, at least) seem to know something about Jon's alleged true parentage or at least the alleged truth surrounding Lyanna's death. Others don't, but should. I have forgotten a lot of characters I had in mind, so I'd like to know who else you think knows. 

&amp;nbsp;

There is of course Ned, but:

1. Littlefinger seems to know more than he's letting on about Lyanna when he has that little chat with Sansa in the crypts. If he knows that Lyanna and Rhaegar fell in love and banged a bit, is it possible that he was able to piece together the truth about Jon?

2. Varys has one of the largest networks of spies and doesn't like to say more than he needs to. He says that he wants what's best for 'the realm' and seems to be supporting the Targaryen dynasty. If the theories are true, Jon would be able to unite the North and the South and continue the Targaryen dynasty and the Stark legacy, thus being what is potentially best for 'the realm'. Why wouldn't Varys know about Jon? I find it a little curious that Jon is one of the most important figures in Westeros, bastard or not, and Varys has not mentioned him once. Perhaps he's currently supporting Dany to use her as a tool to wipe out the current rulers of Westeros to prepare the way for Jon. Lets face it, she's not the best ruler, is she? 

3. Stannis seems to know more than he's letting on too. He wanted Jon to help him take Winterfell and was prepared to legitimise him. He also told his wife that Ned wasn't the kind of guy to bang some chick on the side. Perhaps he was prepared to legitimise Jon because he knows Jon was a Stark all along. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Stannis seems like the kind of guy who doesn't usually act against law and customs, so why would he legitimise Jon just to get him to fight? He was already convinced he could get the wildlings to fight for him. What's so special about a bastard? I don't know how he'd know or why he hasn't told Robert though. 

4. Jeor Mormont, according to Sam, 'saw something in' Jon. Whether it be his beautiful hair or his luscious eyes, that 'something' caused Jeor to give Jon a lot of special treatment. I get that it could just be because he thought Jon was Ned's son and the Mormonts are loyal to the Starks, but there could be something more there. He gave his House's ancestral sword to Jon for god's sake - that's like Ned giving Ice to Tommen because he thinks he's Robert's son and he can see Tommen has a good heart. I mean Tommen would've had to save Ned's life, but you get the idea. I don't think Jon would get anything from any other man at the Wall for saving his life, he's at the Wall and there are no titles or families there. I recognise there's a lot of different things going on here, but I just thought Jeor was a bit... over-affectionate, if you will. Perhaps he thought Jon, once he discovers his true parentage, could rally more northerners to fight for the Night's Watch. I don't know how Jeor would know either, though. 

5. Benjen was part of the reason Jon joined the Night's Watch in the first place. He made Jon think it was a good place to be when he knew the opposite. If Ned encouraged Jon to join the Watch to protect him, perhaps Benjen was in on it. Perhaps Benjen saw Lyanna and Rhaegar ride off together, perhaps Ned told him what happened. After all, at that time, Benjen and Ned were the only Starks left (that I know of). If Ned were to die or have to go away for whatever reason, Benjen would have to look after Jon. Perhaps Benjen ditched his Watch mates after an attack, sneaked through the wall and is mucking around in the crypts in Winterfell, keeping an eye on the place for Jon or keeping the whole ""there must always be a Stark in Winterfell"" thing going.
 
6. Melisandre acts pretty damn weird around Jon. Perhaps Stannis told her something and now she wants to get Jon in the sack because he's got Targaryen king's blood.

That's all I can remember for now. What do you guys think?",57,20,False,self,,,,,

For season 1 we had Cerci, Tyrion, Ned, Robert, Jon and Daenerys. 

After Ned and Robert pass on, they are replaced with Jaime and Robb Stark. Jaime now pertinently stays on with the others.

Due to the Lannister's Regards, Robb's last appearance is on Season 3, and he is replaced by Oberyn Martell. Curious that they choose a popular character that only lasted one season. 

Now with season Five, Oberyn is dead, and once again we are missing a spot. 

Will we get a character like Jaime that has been with us from the start that had a good arc this season like Sansa or Jorah?

Or will they now stick with characters that do not last the season? maybe Stannis will be there? (RIP Mannis)

Thoughts everyone?

I am almost finished watching season 2 for the first time.  I have not read any of the ASOIAF books.

At the point I am in the season, the War of Five Kings has begun.  Stannis is preparing to march on King's Landing, and Renley was planning on doing the same until he was killed.  But there is something I cannot figure out.  It seems as though the Lannisters took King's Landing fairly quickly.  Why did they allow the two Baratheon brothers to leave the city at all?  They just ended up being a threat, and would have been great leverage.

It seems like a huge mistake on the Lannisters' part.  Perhaps there's something I missed.",21,7,False,self,,,,,

However, what if the Theory actually supports the opposite. First I would like to examine that most Targaryens are Blonde/Silver haired, light eyed (I know not all but the majority). Though Tyrion has light eyes, he is dark haired. However, Cercei and Jamie are both light haired and only Jamie of the two has light eyes. Also, if we think about the Targaryen house they are very much associated with Brother/Sister relationships to keep the Bloodline ""pure"". As many know Cercei and Jamie have 3 children together or at least in theory Joffery, Myrcella and Tommen. Lastly, comes the question why Tywin does not stay with the Ty__ theme when it came to his first heir with Jaime, unless Tyrion was his first heir. I understand Tywin wants to deny that Tyrion is his son in many parts ex. when Tyrion asks for Casterly Rock and ex. when Tyrion kills him. However, I believe that there are many other reasons why we should believe just the opposite. However, I really believe that the Twins (Cercei and Jamie) are not related to Tyrion, just because certain things do not make sense or match up.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

Renly, pretty much no matter what, was doomed to fail as king. I'm not talking politically or militarily. He was going to die, no matter what.

Lets look at Renly's best case scenario, what happens if everything went as he planned:

Before Robert dies, Renly takes Ser Loras' advice and secretly declares himself for the Iron Throne. His first move is to gain Ned Stark's support, who was just named ""protector of the realm"" by King Robert before he died. Renly knows this because he spoke with his dying brother after Ned left. 

&gt;Renly- ""Give me an hour and I could put 100 swords at your command.""

&gt;Eddard- ""And what should I do with 100 swords?""

&gt;Renly- ""Strike, tonight while the castle sleeps. We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody. Protector of the realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom. Every moment you delay, gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.""

&gt;Eddard- ""What about Stannis?""

&gt;Renly- ""Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm.""

&gt;Eddard- ""Stannis is your older brother.""

&gt;Renly- ""This isn't about the bloody line of succession, that didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King, it should't matter now. What's best for the kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is. He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a king. I am.""

Now, what if Ned accepted Renly's proposal? What if Eddard Stark threw down his honor and conspired with Renly to sieze the throne from Joffery. 

Best case scenario goes as follows: Since Robert dies that evening, Renly and Ned cannot strike during the night. Ned and Renly are informed of Robert's death and of the newly proclaimed ""King Joffrey."" Renly, being a savvy politician who has sat on the small council for years, doesn't trust Littlefinger and his Gold Cloaks as far as he can throw them. Ned and Renly, with the combined strength of their two household guards (and Ser Loras Tyrell and his men), march into the throne room and confront Joffrey and Cersei. Let's assume Littlefinger never get the Gold Cloaks to support the Lannisters. 

Renly declares Joffery a bastard of incest, Ned backs him up with evidence. With Robert's note, and the evidence of incest against Joffrey and the queen, Ser Barristan and the Kingsguard stand down. Renly and Ned order their men to seize Joffery. Cersei, afraid they will harm her son, stands her ground. Fighting breaks out and the Lannister guards are overrun. The Hound would most likely die in the fighting, but Cersei and Joffrey would be taken prisoner, kicking and screaming into their cells. The Stark and Baratheon guards go rampaging though the Red Keep, eliminating/ capturing all the Lannister guards, and taking Tommen and Myrcella as prisoners too. Renly then sits upon the Iron Throne, as king. Cersei and the bastards are locked away in cells, as hostages. 

Hooray, all hail King Renly! It's over right, the Seven Kingdoms live on happily under the fair, just King Renly, nope. The Lion won't go down so easily, but the Lannisters are hardly a problem for Renly. At this time, Tywin and Jaime Lannister were in the Westerlands preparing their invasion of the Riverlands. When the ravens arrive to all the lords of Westeros declaring Cersei's children as bastards, news of Cersei's imprisonment will make its way into the Lannister camp. Tywin would have to decide whether or not to go to war. Since Renly almost certainly knows Tywin would go to war to defend the Lannister name, Ser Loras would immediately contact his family at High Garden and tell them to ride to King's Landing, with an army. If Renly were to marry Margary Tyrell, he would be able to have the entire might of the Stormlands and the Reach behind his back. And with Ned's support, he could bring the North into the war too. Tywin would be facing the combined strength of the Stormlands, the Reach, the Riverlands, and the North; an impossible enemy to defeat. 

Tywin is cool headed, and knows when he is beat. To his knowledge, Catelyn Stark holds his his son Tyrion as hostage in the Eyrie, Renly Baratheon holds his daughter and grandchildren hostage in King's Landing, the Tyrells march to King's Landing with their banners and a pretty new wife, the Stormlords march to defend their liege lord, the Riverlords stand guard at his borders, and the Northern banners ride south to Moat Calin in case war beaks out. Jaime is the true wild card in this scenario. His devotion to Cersei might force Tywin to plunge his men into war, but diplomacy is his best option for Tywin Lannister. Whether Ned convinces Renly to bring Tywin to court to answer for the crimes of Gregor Clegane, or if Renly offers Tywin amnesty if he swears fidelity, it doesn't matter. War or no, nothing too major will occur on the battlefield that will impact the real juice of the story. 

**Stannis Baratheon on Dragonstone.** This is where things get real interesting. Stannis would inevitably be one of the lords who receives the raven declaring Cersei's children as abominations of incest. Stannis, grinding his teeth, would be enraged that his own brother usurped his rightful title. Stannis pretty much plays his cards the same. He declares himself the one true king and Ser Davos goes out trying to rally support. Stannis grinds his teeth while he has to sit back and do nothing as Renly weds Margary Tyrell in King's Landing. Renly says he has 100,000 men, and many more in the North and Riverlands willing to stand behind him. Stannis can do nothing. 

Then, the bleeding star comes. Mellisandre sees the prophesy has come true, the arrival of the red comet proves one thing, Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn. Stannis burns the idols and grabs Lightbringer out of the flames. Mellisandre is completely devoted to him now. 

After Ser Davos has scrounged up what meager support he could find, Stannis meets Renly in person to discuss the throne. The conversation comes out very similarly to how it really was, neither men back down, and both give each other ultimatums. Stannis rides back to his ship knowing what needs to be done. He talks to Ser Davos, and orders him to smuggle the Red Woman onto the shore of King's Landing. 

This is where the doomed Renly Baratheon meets his fate. Davos, an expert smuggler, easily gets Mellisandre into Backwater Bay. Mellisandre finds a nice conformable spot, lies down, and unleashes her shadow baby. The shadow assassin finds its way through the city, up the Red Keep, and stabs King Renly from behind (probably in front of Ned for ironic purposes). Ned goes into panic mode, gets the girls, and rides out of the city back to Winterfell. Stannis would have Ned's head on a spike for supporting Renly. The grieving Tyrells also get the hell out, along with anyone else who sees Stannis as a threat to their livelihood. But one thing remains clear, **Renly is dead**, even though he was king.

Stannis sails into the King's Landing the next day, greeted by the Baratheon soldiers who occupy the city. Stannis is declared king and Renly's ambition lies dead on the floor. THE MANNIS WINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The point is, that in almost any scenario where Renly declares himself for the throne, and Stannis has devoted Mellisandre with him, he's doomed, end of story. Renly taking King's landing only makes Stannis' job easier. So if anyone ever goes, ""Ned, you idiot! Why didn't you support Renly!!??"" Remember, Renly was doomed the moment he declared himself king. While this would end up way, way better for Ned (he's still alive, his daughters alive, his sons alive), Renly is toast. 

**TL;DR:** Renly was doomed as king because shadowbabies. Renly seizing King's Landing would only end with Stannis as the king. ",45,72,False,self,,,,,

Of course the main theory is that Jon will become Azor Ahai and defeat the Others. There is just one thing I have a question about, is there a reason we presume Jon will still be himself when he becomes AA instead of AA becoming Jon and using his body as a vessel? There are just 2 hangups I have with Jon being himself after becoming AA:

1. Melisandre is said to be having nightmares about someone that we can presume to be Bran. While she could be wrong about the meaning of the dream, it seems too big of a connection to rule out. If they are indeed nightmares, then that would hint her and Bran would be on opposing sides, and thus Bran and AA (since Melisandre would be following AA) would be on opposing sides. This would put either the motives of Bloodraven or the motives of AA into question if they are indeed opposing.

2. The prologue of A Dance With Dragons is about the warg Sixskins and his ability to warg after his 'first death'. This could be a red herring, but at the end of the same book Jon may warg out of his body while AA takes control of it. This would make the prologue seem more pertinent, or it could just be random background information. However, I have read Jon may warg out and then back into his own body which also seems plausible.

I was mainly wondering if there was something in the books that would completely disprove this theory.",18,8,False,self,,,,,

Let's be one hundred percent clear: Ned Stark did not fight with the Valyrian Steel great sword Ice. Not in his duel with Jaime, not ever.

&amp;nbsp; 

Ice was a great sword, which meant it was so large most men could barely wield it, even with the lightness that was inherent in Valyrian steel. Ice was used strictly for ceremonial purposes, such as the beheading of prisoners. In fact it was so large, it was later melted down and made into TWO longswords, Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail.
 
&amp;nbsp;

On the show, during the fight with Jaime, Ned is clearly using a longsword, not a great sword.
 
&amp;nbsp;

In the books, there is never any mention whatsoever of Ned walking around the streets of King's Landing with a six foot sword strapped to his back. GRRM would have certainly mentioned Ice had it been present, as he does any time a Valyrian Steel sword is present. Hell, even a Valyrian steel arakh belonging to a very minor character gets mentioned every time it appears in AFFC.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So please stop perpetuating this myth that Ned fought with Ice.",102,83,False,self,,,,,

^ You've all seen the teaser trailer for the new season. Some of you have even picked up a distinct sound 22 seconds into the video. For the LoL uninformed: it is the exact sound used to notify players that a match has been found. Clearly with such overlap between the fan-bases (this is a sweeping generalization), there has to be some coincidence, some correlation, right?! Well there is. If you sort the League of Legends champions by release date, the 22nd champion to be released is Tryndamere. What is so special about this champion and what is he known for? Well, as he is about to die he can activate his ultimate ""Undying Rage"" which sends Tryndamere into a burning frenzy which prevents/prolongs his impending doom.    

The case is closed. Jon Snow will enter into an Undying Rage in Season 6 - you saw it uncovered here first.",11,17,False,self,,,,,

Why was he sent to Riverrun as a ward?
If anything, wouldn't he be more likely to be sent to the Eyrie or even one of the other houses of the Vale? What was the reasoning behind sending him out his own region?

And a question on wards in general, was it common for wards to be sent outside of one's immediate area. I mean like, it wouldn't have been normal for a small house from the Reach to voluntarily send their kid as a ward in the Westerlands or Stormlands unless the families had some sort of alliance. And probably even less common would be a kid from a minor house not even in the region being sent to live as a ward in the castle of a great house. 

I've seen some of the Southern Ambitions theories where basically all the great houses took on each other's kids as wards so as to strengthen alliances or whatever, but Littlefinger comes from such a minor house that I can't think of any logical explanation as to why he would be sent off to the Tullys instead of any of the other great houses of the Vale. 

It's been a few years since I've read the books so I apologize if this has a totally obvious explanation that I just forgot about. 


EDIT: Another question. How does wardship even work in this case. Does Petyr or someone from his family send an application raven to Hoster Tully like ""hey this is my rsum  and application essay. Please pick me to live in your house and basically be raised by you"". All jokes aside, in Littlefinger's case why would Hoster even admit him as a ward if he's a) not from one of his vassal houses, and b) from a relatively menial house (of course Baelish isn't one of the small folk or anything, but his house can easily be regarded as a very marginal part of the nobility class) ",9,10,False,self,,,,,

Hear me out. If this theory has played out before...I apologize...but watching the new Teaser from HBO last night and going over the theories on this thread made me think. What if Bran as a Greenseer has already seen this event ( Jon Snow being betrayed by his own Brothers) and has warned/indicated Ghost about this event. We all know that as Summer he has been able to sense other Direwolves as they are his brothers as well...What if his powers have manifested and he has been able to harness his powers and seen this past and warned Ghost about it somehow. 

Now we all know that Melisandre is there on the wall, She is a disciple of R'hllor. We also know that Thoros of Myr is a red priest of R'hllor from the Free City of Myr, and Thoros inadvertently resurrected Beric Dondarrion while performing the last kiss. The two men founded an outlaw group, the brotherhood without banners. Melisandre being present at the wall provides a smoke screen that she will resurrect Jon Snow just like Throros has been doing to Beric, but he wont be resurrected instead he Wargs Into Ghost when he is apparently ""killed"" and when the Black Brothers leave him for dead after he is stabbed repeatedly by Bowen Marsh and other black brothers, who attack in tears while muttering ""for the Watch"". He gets a Second Life. What is second life you ask...

**Second Life**

It is incredibly traumatic for a warg if the animal whose mind they have entered dies while they are controlling it, but the warg will survive this. Also there is a brilliant theory that says All Starks are Wargs...so this is kind of playing into that...If a warg's own body is killed while entering the mind of an animal, however, the warg's human consciousness can live on inside of the animal. When Jon Snow killed the wildling Orell by running him through with his sword Longclaw, with his dying breath Orell managed to warg his mind into his eagle. While Orell's human body died, his consciousness survived in the eagle, and proceeded to claw at Jon's face with his new body's talons until Jon was able to fend him off. Also in the first chapter of Dance with Dragon we see how a warg tries to get control of another human being and I truly believe the series and the Books are going to go in this direction.",35,9,False,self,,,,,

So as we all know Jon is joining the NW and Jaime comes upon him at the armory in winter fell while he's having needle made. The conversation is basically just Jaime sarcastically thanking Jon for his service and reminding him how shitty it will be. 

While watching this scene I tried to imagine a possibility of Jaime in the watch. One thing I think that could happen leading to this possibility is if Jaime kills Cersei to protect KL from being burned to the ground by her after Tommens inevitable death. Once he kills Cersei and Tommen is dead Jaime will have 0 allies in Kings Landing. After all he is the Kingslayer and now having killed his sister the Queenslayer as well. This certainly will not sit well with the people of KL that are left. 

If Jaime is in a position like this I could potentially see him joining the Nights Watch to escape prosecution. I suppose he could go rule over Castlery Rock but still not very many Lannisters aside from Kevan left in the picture. 

So let's say for conversation sake that Jaime does make it to the wall and joins the NW. The obvious choice for the men of the watch would be to appoint him Lord Commander. This will be after Ser Allister steps down or is (hopefully) killed in the wake of Jon returning. This would leave the men of the NW in need of a new Lord Commander and who better than the former head of the Kingsgaurd our boy Jaime Lannister. 

One might argue that Jaime would never go without women or luxury but let's remember he has only one love and that is likely the person who he will end up killing. He is tried and tested in the field and spent months as a prisoner of war. While he has had it easy in life and lived well he has also known hardship. 

One conflict I see is that Jaime is determined not to leave the Kingsguard. However, without someone pro-Lannister on the throne I don't see him staying around guarding for long. 

Who knows I could be completely wrong but I have the 1% off chance that I'm right I would like to hear what you all think. ",64,55,False,self,,,,,

Later, Qyburn pops up in Kings Landing and gets in the good graces of Cersei. He builds Frankenmountain. 

We now have a dude who was saved by Starks, with a killing machine, who's super tight with Cersei (known for her political mishaps). Qyburn's the only one who embraced Cersei after her walk of shame. She's totally in his lap (literally and metaphorically). 

Seems to me like a recipe for sabotage and Stark vengeance. Thoughts?

He walks through the tunnel and into the little strip of woods where he meets the wildlings and Mance. Shortly after that, Stannis Baratheon's army attacks and defeats the wildlings. My question, is where the hell did Stannis's army come from? He said at the iron bank he had 4,000 soldiers still loyal to him, did all 4 thousand come through the tunnel after Jon Snow? And we also see his army attacking from both sides of the strip of woods the wildlings were in, so did they come through the tunnel, and flank the woods somehow without a single wildling seeing them?

(fan since 4 days ago) :)

 I had a lot of warnings they kill a lot of people on this show, in fact this is all i knew about the show : Dragons, medieval stuff, and relentless killing of important characters. I must say, it still caught me off guard. Thats my only gripe with the show, as is for a lot of people. I understand it would be lame without important characters dying, but i feel the show, in its 5th season is running out of people to relate or care about. 

  The only people for me to root for are
   Arya, who is now blind, although they might unblind her at some point.
  Tyrion, who is now in a land i dont really care about. Meereen can go fuck itself for all i care.
  The mother of Dragons, who i see as a weak character i dont much care about, and unless she actually crosses the sea, i really dont.
  The Stark boy in the North, who by the way, arrives at the damn tree at the beginning of season 5,and the scene is set for a great reveal, and is never shown again. That was messed up. Yeah, so theres him... if he bothers to show up on screen again.
  Sansa has a punchable face and i cringe everytime she is on screen.
  Brianne i like, but she seems like a lost sheep, doing fetch quests.
  Sam, the fat one, i also dont care about, and i hate his girlfriend.It seems like R.R. Martin wrote himself as Sam. Good for him if true, but i dont care.
  
  Congrats to the writers, i didnt expect Jon Snow to die, i think i liked him the most. I cant find any reason for him to die, other than the show trying to be unexpected. He could have at least died at the hand of the White Walker, not stabbed in a corner by some rapists. Wow, much misery, such drama... So yeah. 
  You might think that introducing new characters will solve this problem. But then the show becomes 2 shows. The first seasons with the first characters, and the latter seasons with the latter characters.

   Concerning the future, I think the Stark boy will either be the only one to survive the whole series, or the last one to die. He will obviously possess a dragon, and probably be trapped in it for some reason. Thats what they meant when they said he will fly. Brianne will at some point fight White Walkers. Arya will probably become an assassin. Cersei will either be 10 times more vicious, or completely change and become good. If that happens, she will die the instant she does a good deed.

How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

##5.05 - ""Kill the Boy""

* Directed By: Jeremy Podeswa
* Written By: Bryan Cogman
* Originally Aired: May 10, 2015

Brienne and Podrick arrive at an inn near Winterfell and asks for help getting a message to Sansa, who, in Winterfell, is reunited with Reek, formerly Theon Greyjoy. At the Wall, Tormund accepts an alliance with the Night's Watch that will allow Wildlings to settle south of the Wall. Jon agrees to accompany Tormund to meet the Wildlings at Hardhome. Stannis' army leaves for Winterfell, taking Selyse and Shireen with them. In Meereen, Grey Worm recuperates. Daenerys feeds a Meereenese noble to Viserion and Rhaegal in retaliation for Ser Barristan's death and imprisons others. She later agrees to reopen the fighting pits and marry Hizdahr zo Loraq to facilitate peace. At sea, Tyrion and Jorah sail through Valyria and are attacked by a group of stone men. They manage to escape, but Jorah is infected with greyscale.

##5.06 - ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken""

* Directed By: Jeremy Podeswa
* Written By: Bryan Cogman
* Originally Aired: May 17, 2015

Jaqen takes Arya to a chamber with the faces of all the people that have died in the House of Black and White. Jaime and Bronn reach the Water Gardens, where they find Myrcella and are attacked by the Sand Snakes. The fight is broken up by Dornish guards. Jorah and Tyrion run into slavers, whom Tyrion manages to convince to take them to the fighting pits of Meereen. Petyr informs Cersei of Roose's plan to marry Sansa to Ramsay, and convinces her to allow him to lead the knights of the Vale to Winterfell to destroy both the Boltons and Stannis, asking that he be named Warden of the North in return. Olenna arrives in King's Landing and warns Cersei that the imprisonment of Loras has put their alliance in peril. At Loras' hearing, Loras and Margaery both deny Loras' homosexuality. Olyvar contradicts their testimony, and Margaery is arrested for lying to the gods. In Winterfell, Sansa is married to Ramsay, who rapes her in front of Reek.

If the white walkers were to invade Westeros from the north, arming the people of the kingdoms with Valyrian steel gives the realm the clear best chance at defeating the white walkers.

It is known that the fire breath of a dragon is a necessity in the forging of Valyrian weapons. Perhaps Dany will realize this and use the breath of her dragons to create enough Valyrian weapons to take down the white walkers. 

Having dragon's breath is one step, but the physical process of forging Valyrian weapons is long forgotten in the realm. It is said that the people of Qohor are the only living men that have knowledge on the process of forging Valyrian weapons. Qohor is the original home of the Unsullied, where Dany went originally in the episode where she burned the master alive and freed the Unsullied.

The knowledge that the people of Qohor know how to forge Valyrian steel is not very commonly known. Someone who is either very smart or reads a lot is most likely to be aware of this. Tyrion (probably the shows smartest character and most avid reader) is now aligned with Dany, which means he has the use of dragons at his disposal. In addition, he is across the narrow sea, meaning he theoretically has easy access to Qohor. 

Even if Tyrion and Dany could successfully forge an influx of Valyrian weapons by utilizing dragon breath and the people of Qohor, Tyrion will realize that Danys following (whoever it may be at the time) will not be enough to take down the white walkers. If they were to unite with the people of the realm and provide Valyrian weapons for all of the great houses and their great Knights, this could be enough to give the white walkers a fight.

I think that would be an awesome way for the show / book saga to end. The combination of Tyrions knowledge and Danys dragon blood &gt; arming Westeros with the Valyrian steel weapons &gt; giving the white walkers and actual fight.",14,0,False,self,,,,,

The Story:

- The first time Eddard saw the beautifull Princess of Dorne, Elia Martel, was during the tourney at Harrenhal. At the opening ceremony Ned has been seen talking and dancing with Elias ""lady in waiting"" Ashara Dayne. The moment, when Rhaegar (Elia's husband) chose Lyanna (Ned's sister) over her, made an impact on Ned. As he recalls it ""the moment when all the smiles died"". Elia's sorrow and Ned's compassion could have been the reason why they met up and fell in love with eachother. Ashara Dayne being the connecting factor.


- Around 282 AC, Rhaegar leaves his wife Elia Martell, the princess of Dorne, and abducts Lyanna Stark (Neds sister) and takes her to the Tower of Joy in Dorne. This might be the moment where Elia seeks to find Ned.


- The abduction of Lyanna Stark and the death of Brandon and Rickett Stark led to Robert's Rebellion. Ned Stark, the new lord of Winterfell, tries to reach Winterfell as he is still in the Vale of Arryn (maybe with Elia?)(282 AC).
 

- Ned Stark reaches Winterfell, called his banners and joined Robert Rebellion (282 AC).


- Ned Stark marries and impregnates Catelyn Stark (282 AC) with Robb Stark to create an alliance with House Tully and leaves her at Riverrun to continue the fight.  


- Robert Baratheon (and everyone else) knows Ned Stark has been unfaithful to Catelyn during this time of war and the name of the woman remains a mystery. Since Robb and Jon don't vary too much of age it must have happened during the rebellion. Either before the marriage with Catelyn or just after. 


- In 283 AC Robert defeats Rhaegar at the battle of the Trident. After this the Mad King Aerys Targaryan keeps Elia Martell hostage in Kings Landing with her children. Elia could have left Ned to go to Kings Landing since she had her children to protect and since she was with child (Jon).


- After giving birth to Jon Snow the raid of Kings landing happened (282 AC, the birthyear of Jon Snow). During the raid Elia Martell is raped and killed by Ser Cregor Clegane. Her other children are both killed during this raid. Ned Stark arrived too late to stop this.


- ""Eddard Stark was disgusted with the act and was haunted afterwards with the memories of Elia and her children's bloody bodies""[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Elia_Martell].


- After the war Ned with six companions approaches the tower of Joy where Ned's sister Lyanna is held. She is guarded by three members of the Kingsguard. He defeats them but finds Lyanna dying in her bed. She might have known about his bastard son Jon and that he survived the raid. She made him promise to retrieve him and raise him at Winterfell.


- Ned leaves for Starfall to find Elia's ""lady in waiting"" Ashara Dayne. Ashara Dayne could have been the one that was instructed by Elia Martell to sneak her child out of Kings Landing. Here Ned Stark finds his bastard son Jon Snow and takes him with him to Winterfell.


Later:

- Jon Snows uncle, the viper (Oberyn Martell), went to avenge his sister (Elia Martell) to challenge the Mountain for a duel. The viper dies in this duel after taking too long finishing the mountain, asking him questions about his sister.


- Three nieces of Jon Snow come into play. Bastard daughters of the Red Viper and part of the Sand Snakes.


- Jon Snow therefore connects the Starks with the Dorne (Elia Martell) and the Targaryan family (the wife of Rhaegar, thus the aunt of Daenerys)


- Will Jon Snow avenge his mother by defeating The Mountain?


- Jon Snow features characteristics from the Starks as well as the Martells (Dark, curly hair)


Could this be possible?

However, recently I've acquired the actual DVD/Blu-Ray sets for the first four seasons. I am staying with a friend for the next month or so, and her parents let her borrow them so that we could watch them. I won't be finished with the books in the next week or two; it took me three months just to finish the first book. At this rate it would take me nine more months approximately to finish the rest of the series (I read on the Kindle, and I'm exactly at 25% done with the entire series right now). 

Since I don't own a TV, I watched the first season on my MacBook Pro. However, now that I temporarily have the first four seasons with my friend and her TV, I'm wondering if it's okay to watch the seasons with her first.

I'm a huge fan of both the books and the show, but like any person who has consumed both, I prefer the books. I spent all of last season pissed off that the show was deviating so far from the books, until I realized why the producers were doing it. Our Lord and Savior, George R.R. Martin, takes a few years to write a book. While the wait is awful (and I expect he's been extra busy the last few years with the show), the final product is always incredible. There was no way He was going to finish the books ahead of the show unless He rushed and put out a shitty final product. With the show moving through production faster than He could write the books, the producers were faced with 3 options.

Option 1: Wait. This was pretty much out of the question, as the younger actors would age, the less dedicated audience would lose interest, and there was just too much studio money on the line.

Option 2: Follow the books (almost) exactly. This would have been difficult to do for a number of reasons. As a general rule for film production, roughly 1 page of script translates into 1 minute of screen time. Since AFFC and ADWD are basically 2 parts of the same 2000 or so page book, there was enough content for a few seasons. However, even if they had followed this approach, they still would have run into the same problem of running out of content once the show surpassed the books.

Option 3: Deviate the show from the books. By leaving some of the story lines (relatively) unchanged (Jon), while completely changing others (Jamie), the show sets itself up as a separate work of art from the books. Some parts of the books will be spoiled, such as Jon Snow being alive, but other parts of it will be completely new. Further, He could change things in the books, so when you're expecting something to happen BAM! something else happens. By making the books and the show two separate works, we get to watch GOT then read GOT and they'll be different, so we won't know what to expect for either. Seems like the best solution to the problem to me.

TL;DR: The show being different from the books means the show can finish and the books won't be entirely spoiled. We get two different works of art in the process.",8,11,False,self,,,,,

While, I for one would hate that, it would be an interesting twist that I would respect nonetheless. One variant of these events that I would like, that I haven't seen anyone come up with would be Bran warging into *Melisandre* and using her blood magic to bring Jon back.

That's completely fine and understandable considering it's the biggest show on TV, and GRRM won't finish the series for some time. 

To preface this, I want to say that both the show and the books are great. Regardless of their differences, they're both incredibly well done and very enjoyable. That being said, I'm disappointed in some of the ways they're killing characters in the show. Characters who haven't even died in the books yet. There are a few, but the biggest one and the one that really bothers me is Stannis Baratheon.

I don't exactly have a problem with how the show killed Stannis, it made sense in the show and I'm not upset with how he died. What I do have a problem with, is that they killed him in general. 

Unless GRRM has told D&amp;D that his plans for Stannis in the books aren't very big at all, meaning maybe he just loses everything and dies in whatever non-important fashion, that I could understand. If GRRM told them Stannis is no big deal from here on, I can understand the show deciding to kill Stannis in a way that makes sense for them - like Brienne getting her revenge.

But, why not just leave a cliffhanger with Stannis until they find out how important his role is in the books? Why not just let Stannis survive a little longer before killing him, just in case he turns out to have a huge role in GRRM's tale?

I just can't help but think WHAT IF when it comes to Stannis, what if he turns out to play a epic role towards the end of GRRM's story? What if Stannis gathers another massive army? What if he somehow rejoins with Melisandre, what if he fights beside Jon Snow or Azor Ahai? What if Stannis kills someone or something important to the story? What if Stannis sits the Iron Throne?

I'd just hate to see GRRM have much bigger or even epic plans for Stannis as this story pans out, and then when it's all said an done...the TV show just killed him for really no good reason in season 5? Like I said, I understand the differences in the show and the books, there are a lot, and there should be. But if Stannis ends up becoming paramount in the rest of the books, it's going to look really bad that the show decided to kill him off, when it was completely unnecessary. Especially if he were to become King at the end of ASoIF or something major like that.

Sorry for that.

Game of Thrones is a show that is almost universally loved and praised. I'm interested in reading some negative points of view as well. However, I had a hard time finding any well thought-out criticism of the show or the books. Most of the stuff I've found either takes issue with sex and violence, or criticizes some very specific scenes (cough Dorne cough), or is just, plainly speaking, low quality (""OMG this show is so overrated, DO U AGREE""). What I'd like to read is criticism of character development, story, world-building, etc. - something where the author clearly put in the effort and discusses it from a literary or cinematic point of view (and not from the moral point of view). Do you know of any such articles/blog posts/whatever? You don't necessarily have to agree with the author, as long as the material is of reasonable quality. I'm also interested in hearing your own opinions.

TL;DR: I'd appreciate links to blogs with some well-thought-out criticism of the books or the show, as well as your own criticism.",70,4,False,self,,,,,

It was bigger compared to other ppl. Im pretty sure Qyburn used another head to necromancy thing. (cuz headless necromancy thing is too wrong for GRRM) My theory is Qyburn used Robb Stark's head to complete necromancy in Mountain's body and thats why he never removes his helm. Because after the red wedding, joffrey wanted to have Robb's head and ordered that to Walder Frey. My second theory is if Arya can reaches to Westeros and tries to kill Mountain, somehow she will remove his helm and gets shocked for the last time. She will die with knowing Robert Strong's ""true"" idenity.

He already has a healthy interest in Robb and has when I tell him to pay close attention to Jon's story he says ""why, Robb is the protagonist?""




This is a rare gift I have here.  I want to encourage this love for Robb without spoiling anything.  I already slipped up a little when he asked if spurning Walder's daughter would come back to haunt him, but my friend certainly doesn't suspect the magnitude of what's coming.




Has anyone been in a similar position?  Any tips on things to say to foster his love for Robb?  I'm open to blatant lying :)




Thanks!",383,1106,False,self,,,,,

House Baratheon was founded by Orys Baratheon, the bastard half-brother of Aegon the Conqueror. My point is, has anyone noticed how the Baratheon line was started by a bastard, and ends with a bastard? It does not seem like a coincidence, but since Orys Baratheon was made Lord of Storm's End by an invading Targaryen, then maybe Gendry could be made the Lord of Storm's End by Daenerys. 

This may be unlikely, however, since Gendry was unrecognized and so it would be unlikely that she would do this, and also because she seems to dislike Baratheons since they took the throne away from her family.

This is likely to have been suggested before multiple times, but I just felt like posting it in case.

Edit: This is dependant on whether or not Stannis is in fact dead, but I think he most likely is. Even though he is not dead in the books, we already know the show is drifting from the books. I also completely forgot about Edric Storm, but to those asking about Barra, he is dead, he is the baby Janos Slynt killed in Littlefinger's brothel (at least he is in the show).",348,1219,False,self,,,,,

Remember the good ol' days when your favorite characters were still alive?  Go back and watch old episodes with the benefit of hindsight!  How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

Make sure to keep the following points in mind before reading or contributing to this thread:

* This thread is scoped for **SEASON 5 SPOILERS.**  This is a rewatch series, so if you are here then it is assumed that you have already seen the entire series at least once.  Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 5.10 is ok without tags.

##5.07 - ""The Gift""

* Directed By: Miguel Sapochnik
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 24, 2015

Jon leaves for Hardhome with Tormund and some rangers. Maester Aemon dies shortly after. Gilly is attacked by two brothers, but Sam comes to her rescue. Sansa asks Reek to help her escape Winterfell, but Reek instead informs Ramsay, who flays the woman who had offered to help Sansa. At Stannis' army's camp, Melisandre suggests sacrificing Shireen; Stannis is disgusted and refuses. Jorah and Tyrion are sold as slaves to Yezzan zo Qaggaz. The two are brought to a local fighting pit, that Daenerys and her consort happen to be visiting in preparation for the coming games at Daznak's pit. Jorah defeats the other slaves and reveals his identity to Daenerys, and that he brought Tyrion as a gift for her. In Dorne, Myrcella asks Jaime why he came to rescue her when she wants to marry Trystane. Olenna's demand for Loras and Margaery's release is declined by the High Sparrow. Later, the High Sparrow reveals to Cersei his knowledge of her and Lancel's adulterous relationship and has her imprisoned.

##5.08 - ""Hardhome""

* Directed By: Miguel Sapochnik
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 31, 2015

Cersei refuses to confess her sins. Arya assumes the identity of Lana, an oyster merchant. Jaqen tells her to study a thin man who sells marine insurance, but has defrauded benefactors. She is to learn everything about the thin man, and then poison him. Olly questions Sam about Jon's alliance with the wildlings. Reek tells Sansa there is no escape from Ramsey, and reveals that he faked the deaths of her younger brothers. Ramsay suggests to his father that they move on Stannis and asks for twenty good men. In Meereen, Tyrion convinces Daenerys to spare Jorah's life and she exiles him again. Jorah goes back to Yezzan and asks permission to fight in the pits. Daenerys accepts Tyrion into her council. Arriving at Hardhome, Jon and Tormund convince about five thousand wildlings to join them, when Hardhome is attacked by an army of wights. Jon kills a White Walker with his Valyrian-steel sword. As Jon and the survivors sail away, they witness the Night's King reanimating the deceased wildlings as wights.

This passage from a AFFC Brienne chapter seemed like a bit of foreshadowing. 


 ""Ser Goodwin used to send her to her fathers butcher to 
slaughter lambs and suckling pigs. The piglets squealed and the lambs screamed like frightened 
children. By the time the butchering was done Brienne had been blind with tears, her clothes so 
bloody that she had given them to her maid to burn. But Ser Goodwin still had doubts. A piglet 
is a piglet. It is different with a man. When I was a squire young as you, I had a friend who was 
strong and quick and agile, a champion in the yard. We all knew that one day he would be a 
splendid knight. Then war came to the Stepstones. I saw my friend drive his foeman to his knees 
and knock the axe from his hand, but when he might have finished he held back for half a 
heartbeat. In battle half a heartbeat is a lifetime. The man slipped out his dirk and found a chink 
in my friends armor. His strength, his speed, his valor, all his hard-won skill... it was worth less 
than a mummers fart, because he flinched from killing. Remember that, girl. 
 I will, she promised his shade, there in the piney wood. She sat down on a rock, took out her 
sword, and began to hone its edge. I will remember, and I pray I will not flinch.""

So what do you think? 
what if she didn't kill Stannis?

Could it be any more obvious what the best way around the Wall would be? Considering the position of Hardhome, I consider it even less likely that the Wall was built to keep out the Wildlings.

The Others on the other hand (as we have seen on the TV show at least) appear to have an issue with crossing water. Therefore, the Wall appears to be enough of a barrier for them to be a problem and the sea, an impossibility.

Probably stating all the obvious here, but just had to say. That Wall is definitely coming down!

Thoughts?

-Jaime and Cersei were King and Queen of King's Landing (I figured this one out by the end of Ep. 1 at least)

-Didn't realize ""Ned"" was just a nickname, and kept getting confused when some characters referred to him as ""Eddard""

-Theon was a Step-son of some sort

Okay, maybe it doesn't rhyme. But the season 5 finale left me wondering. Everyone seems to think that Stannis is either dead or going to the wall. This was my expectation as well, until I had the terrible realization that there may be another fate in store for his bruxist behind.

Since things tend to go Ramsay's way quite often (after all, ""Ramsay"" is Valyrian for ""lucky bastard""), there is a chance the Boltons could find Stannis and take him prisoner. If that happens, the newly abandoned Ramsay might decide to turn Stannis into the new Reek now that his precious Theon is gone.

Cersei, clearly annoyed with her uncle's line of questioning, responds that she is not, as it would be ""inappropriate"" for a woman to assume that role. The term ""inappropriate"" implies that a woman serving in this position is not strictly illegal, but this is perhaps unprecedented.

Westerosi law, which puts the youngest male heir in a given family ahead of the eldest female heir in the line of succession, is certainly set up to favor male rule, but we have seen a fair number of women in Westeros wield real political power as the series has progressed. Olenna Tyrell is probably the best example of this, as we see that she is regarded by many as the de facto head of House Tyrell. Other women we have seen step into major advisory roles for claimants to the Iron Throne include Catelyn Stark, (for Robb Stark) and Melisandre (for Stannis Baratheon). None of these women ever actually served as Hand of the King, however; in Melisandre's case, while she did wield great influence, she was explicitly *not* Hand of the King, as Stannis officially gave that position to Davos Seaworth.

However, for all of the politically ambitious women that have been showcased in this series, none seem to have been able to seek power by working their way up to the Small Council. (Even though the people chosen for these positions are theoretically based more on their expertise in a given subject area than anything else). Returning to Cersei for a moment, we see that she first tries to wield power by acting as Queen Regent shortly after Robert's death, then purports to act as a vaguely defined representative of the King once Tommen ascends to the throne. (Iffier still in that case, since there was by then an incumbent Queen in Margaery Tyrell).     ",24,5,False,self,,,,,

So it has been confirmed that Sibel Kekilli will come back in season 6 to play Shae, and i haven't really seen anyone talk about it here on the subreddit. So i was wondering, are there anyone that has any good theories on what her role will be in season 6?? will she appear in some sort of flashback? Or is she actually alive? Perhaps Tyrion didnt kill her, or maybe she gets ressurected by our good lad Qyburn? And regardless of how she comes back, why did it wait until season 6, If she didn't die from Tyrion choking her, wouldnt she be back already during season 5?",83,138,False,self,,,,,

Here's my reasoning

-This season is being shaped up as the season of resurrections and returns:

It's confirmed that Jon Snow is coming back
Shae has been seen on set
The Hound is all but confirmed to make a comeback 

Second: The Greyjoys have a major role in season 6 (What is dead may never die!)

Third: Daenerys leaves her queendom and returns to her Khalessi ways

Fourth: If this article http://winteriscoming.net/2015/12/17/gwen-christie-may-have-given-away-a-minor-spoiler/ is correct then Brienne may/will make it to Riverrun

Fifth: All of the Bran flashbacks

I think it follows that bringing back so many characters won't be seen as bad writing if they frame the season as the season of resurgence. Thoughts?",21,3,False,self,,,,,

Davos is from Flea bottom, the Faith of the Seven is how he is brought up... even the people much more north than King's Landing (see the Lannisters) don't really take the wall seriously, at all. So I really doubt that he would worry about the Ice Zombies. Would the Wildlings really be such a grave thing - it could destabilize the North (having a bigger effect quite possibly)? Surely that could also be useful for Stannis' cause? Did he only do it so that he could hope and divert some attention away from Mel's plans? Did he think it would've been 'the right think to do', it might, but there were many right things to do, why did this seem so overridingly special?

If you don't have a tongue, or speak in an accent from the neck (because who really knows how they sound), Howland Reed can sound a lot like howling reeds. Could this be in reference to the bed of reeds in Greek mythology, in which Midas' barber whispers secrets? The reeds kept the secrets for a time, but later told many passers by of what the barber whispered to them. Perhaps Howland Reed is about to become the new howling reeds, and tell everyone about Jon's lineage.

Anyone ever think that tyrion will return to westeros and finally have casterly rock, like he should have all along, but find it broke due to the large amounts that his father borrowed to whoever he did (I'm still a bit unclear on this), and wind up doing exactly what tywin did when debts where owed to his father (namely drowning 300 people at once)?

There's so many references to the ""you are my son"" thing between tyrion and tywin with tywin never wanting tyrion to gain anything with the family name and tyrion never wanting to act like or be like his father, or any of the lannisters for that matter, and it would be really bittersweet for me if he did finally wind up with the lands to him, but ultimately turn right into the man he absolutely hates",10,2,False,self,,,,,

Astronomy is one of my favorite subjects and I just started speculating on why it would be like that. Yes I know it is a fictional universe meant to have a different environment but there's no harm in trying to solve the whys.

Is there any explanation to the long seasons? There's several things I can think of as explanation:

- The planet has an extremely slow orbit but fast enough to maintain orbit.

- The planet has a nearly fixed axis that tilts at an extremely slow rate. 

- Its star is huge and thus the orbit is much larger than Earth. Causing the planet to be closer and farther to a star than Earth is.

- Another celestial body pulls the planet away from its star temporary. While the normal orbit is not as elliptical as Earth, another celestial body in the star system causes the planet to be pulled farther out. Once every few hundred years, the planet's orbit becomes close enough to another celestial body that planet is pulled off course by gravity. However, it is temporary and eventually the two gets further apart until the star's gravity starts to oull back the planet until it is back into its normal orbit.

Has anyone come up with a theory yet or even given it much thought?

He objects to Mace Tyrell's characterization of the officers of the Iron Bank being ""gamblers."" Historically speaking, Mace may very well have a point, but the incumbent leadership under Tycho does not seem to adhere to this model.

When Stannis &amp; Davos meet with the Iron Bank in S4, Tycho seems to think highly of Tywin Lannister. This is perfectly understandable, in that Tywin had a previous lengthy and successful stint as Hand of the King under Aerys Targaryen before serving in the same capacity under Joffrey &amp; Tommen. Tycho seems to view Tywin is someone who knows how the game is played, and Tycho and/or his predecessors have likely dealt with him in the past. He only begins to warm to the idea of ""buying stock"" in Stannis when Davos notes that the Lannister dynasty is on shaky ground, and that Tywin himself is of advanced age and there is no obvious heir apparent to fill this role once Tywin is either dead or incapacitated.

Although Davos presents his case for Stannis being the *only* plausible long-term candidate for the Iron Throne, I think he probably knew well that the best he could do was convince them that there was an actual path for Stannis, even if it is somewhat narrow. The Lannister-Tyrell alliance still has the advantage of holding the throne, so the Iron Bank tipping the scales somewhat for Stannis would at least put some pressure on the incumbents. And on the offchance that Stannis was able to eventually take King's Landing, his rule would be *heavily* indebted to the Iron Bank both literally and metaphorically, quite possibly for generations to come.

I get the sense that while the loan Stannis received from the Iron Bank was nothing short of *huge* on his end of things, it wasn't necessarily such a major investment for the Iron Bank. As Season 5 opens, Stannis notes that he probably doesn't have enough men as it stands to take Winterfell from the Boltons, despite the fact that he had routed Mance Rayder's army with relative ease and minimal casualties. (Informing his desire to incorporate the defeated Wildlings into his army, only to effectively close that door by ordering Mance's execution). Still, while the Iron Bank was never entirely sold on the idea of Stannis as the long-term favorite, I can hardly imagine that they would have expected his campaign to collapse so quickly and so entirely either.

So the question becomes, 'where do they from here?' Might they be even more cautious now that Stannis' chances went to hell as rapidly as they did? Do they look now to the Lannister-Tyrell alliance? Despite the fact that they remain on shaky ground, there are some formidable, experienced politicians still left on that side in Kevan Lannister and Olenna Tyrell. Or maybe Littlefinger? The savvy diplomat and financier who has consolidated power in the Vale. With experienced hands such as Tyrion Lannister and Varys on her side, Dany is probably someone they would want to look into, but is she too much a wild card at this point? Her track record on maintaining control of both her dragons and the city-states she has conquered and occupied is mixed at best.",31,4,False,self,,,,,

##5.09 - ""The Dance of Dragons""

* Directed By: David Nutter
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 7, 2015

During a snowstorm, Stannis' camp is sabotaged when Ramsay's force of twenty men completely destroy the entire camp's siege equipment and food stores, while inflicting heavy losses on the army's horses. Melisandre insists they must make a sacrifice of King's Blood to reach Winterfell. Stannis reluctantly offers his daughter, Princess Shireen, burning her alive at the stake, while she desperately cries out for her parents. Jon and the wildlings return to the Wall, where their welcome is fraught with tension. In Dorne, Prince Doran permits Jaime to return to King's Landing with Myrcella, provided Trystane accompany them and serve on the small council in Oberyn's stead. In Meereen, the fights at Daznak's pit begin, and Daenerys is stunned to see Jorah amongst the combatants. Although he is successful, his triumph is interrupted by a fierce attack by the Sons of the Harpy, who quickly surround Daenerys and her supporters. Just as all hope seems lost, Drogon arrives, and Daenerys mounts her dragon and flies away from Meereen, her followers and enemies watching alike in awe.

Sansa escapes her room, but is caught by Myranda. Reek kills Myranda and he and Sansa escape from Winterfell by jumping off the castle walls. Cersei confesses to sleeping with Lancel and is forced to walk naked to the Red Keep, as the crowd jeers, spits, and flings filth at her. She is received by the Small Council, with Qyburn introducing a new member of the Kingsguard. Jaime, Myrcella, Bronn and Trystane sail from Dorne. After Myrcella tells Jaime that she knows he is her father, she collapses from being poisoned by Ellaria. Arya infiltrates a brothel and kills Ser Meryn. Jaqen appears to take his own life to repay the Many-faced God for the life stolen by Arya, and Arya is blinded. Varys arrives in Meereen to rule the city with Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei, while Daario and Jorah search for Daenerys, who, far away, is found by a large group of Dothraki and surrounded by their warriors. At Castle Black a group of brothers, including Alliser and Olly, mutiny against Jon, leaving him to die.

I'm just wondering as to why Ned didn't call for a trial by combat, seeing as he likely would have stood a chance against anyone besides Gregor.
I remember a conversation Ned has with Ser Barristan, and I can't quite remember if the same interaction happened in the books. Essentially, Ned and Barristan were complimenting how great a warrior the other was, and how lucky they were they didn't come across each other during Robert's Rebellion.

I know Ned had to die to set the 'Game' really in motion, but plausibly speaking, shouldn't he have called for a trial by combat?!

TLDR; Ned could have called for a TBC, Iced errbody, and then Robb wouldn't be so reckless to get South and Cat wouldn't unwillingly trust the Freys etc.

This is in reference to the death of Jon Arryn.


At the start, we are made to believe that the Lannisters killed Jon Arryn because he knew about the relationship between Cersei and Jaime, and about the illegitimacy of Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella. This causes Ned Stark to travel to King's Landing (although he was planning to go anyway due to King Robert's order/request, this MADE him go). As time progresses we see a series of clues strengthening the fact that Lannisters indeed killed Jon. 


This is due to Littlefinger mentioning to Ned Stark about how Ser Hugh (personal squire to Jon Arryn) was out of nowhere knighted after Jon's death. Ned is about to question him, but The Mountain kills him. This leads Ned (and us) to further think it is the Lannisters who got him killed (facing The Mountain is death sentence, yo) so that he doesn't speak out. 


The War of the Five Kings happened and later in Season 4 is when we learn that it was Littlefinger who did it (had Lysa do it, to be precise). 


So, what we thought happened:


Jon Arryn found out about the secret, so the Lannisters had Ser Hugh poison him. Pycelle thinks it was Cersei's wish and hence covers it up. The Lannisters then kill Ser Hugh so that the truth doesn't come out.


But what really happened (this is the fun part):

Jon Arryn wanted Stannis to foster his son Robin. Lysa was opposed to this, plus she had the feels for Littlefinger. So, on Littlefinger's wish, she poisons Jon Arryn and writes a letter to Catelyn Stark, blaming the Lannisters. Littlefinger cleverly leads Ned to Ser Hugh (who very conveniently seems to be a dick, so we and Ned believe him to be the killer). Littlefinger (probably) makes sure Ser Hugh faces The Mountain. Ser Hugh gets killed, Ned thinks it was on purpose (""Who holds the straws?"") Littlefinger then leads Ned to make the wrong conclusions and basically kickstarts the whole Starks vs. Lannisters rivalry. 


And GRRM thought of *all* that BEFORE writing the story! ",318,1271,False,self,,,,,

He genuinely thought she was the most beautiful woman to ever live. He was an honorable man at that point, which is why he was Ned's best friend. Sure he liked women, but he was not married to the person he wanted to marry yet, and therefore had no commitment to anyone yet. He also wasn't having sex consistently like you can with your wife. Had he married her, he would have been faithful and honorable to her, and they would have had the most awesome kids ever, especially sons fostered in the Vale or up North. She was his dream girl, all those other ones were practice for the real deal. 

The day Rhaegar (dishonorably no matter how you look at it) stole her, Robert was never the same. He didn't kill Rhaegar because it was a slight to his honor, his ferocity wasn't channelled because of perceptions, but because a shameless Prince took his love away. He saw the means to make that man pay, he rallied men with a charisma unseen, a charisma fueled by his hurt from having his love taken away. Men saw his passion, and knew he was a man they could follow, a man who will get the job done...a man they wanted to help do it. 

He didn't love Cersei. In Westeros, most people marry someone they don't love, but may grow to love. Robert uniquely was paired with the woman he loved. And then to have someone take her away. Not cool. He was never the same. He had to have the typical random ""do it solely for politics"" marriage. 

He didn't want to be King. He felt guilty about even being King because it came about, through losing Lyanna, like she was a sacrifice for it to happen, and he would gladly trade even miserable second of it back for her. He resented being King and probably hated how much Cersei loved it all,  subconsciously he probably even knew those little yellow haired shits weren't his. He just wanted Lyanna, and when the war was over, I think he went back to being the kid he was in the Vale, and never really grew up after that, because growing up meant he had to actually accept the destiny fate dealt him.

Tinfoil (please respond to this separately from the rest) Robert had dragon blood, probably more than a bit, not only his grandmother but his entire line to start with and additional ""infusions"" every couple generations. This story is about fate gone awry and the butterfly effect of that. Robert was supposed to have the song of Ice and Fire with Lyanna, and temptation, greed, and lust screwed that up. So now there is no PTWP or Azor Ahai or Last Hero, so dragons had to come back fully, and now the scorched earth method has to be applied. Burn it all and start over, the disease has spread too far. The bittersweet ending is that all of Westeros is destroyed...completely burned along with the Others, but some people make it to Essos, a large fleet, a mass exodus. And that will probably being an invasion with The Westerosi slaughtering the Essosi natives. Extra bitter...but crazy cackling Dany and brooding Jon Snow, regular Snow, just Ned's bastard, end up ruling something. Extra sweet? Also, Tyrion lives. Because he's in universe GRRM...playing the troll all along.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTgiPmG7OLE

So... Varys has the sorcerer who cut off his genitalia in the box in front of him, and he is speaking of revenge to Tyrion, that if he has the stomach for it, revenge will be had for both of them I'm assuming. I dont remember hearing any reference about this sorcerer in any future episodes. What happened to this guy? Wondering if I've missed something. I have not read much of the books past the first one. I'm open to clarification from book readers if this is explained there.

Also, it seems Varys hates magic and anyone who performs it. Why would he be with Dany and her dragons then? Is he accepting of her? Is he honest when he says Dany should be followed and she can be good for the realm? That comment about hating magic really got me curious. ",4,4,False,self,,,,,

So people have been debating as to whether Jon, Danny, or Tyrion are going to take the Iron Throne since Danny is directly a Targaryen, Jon is most likely a Targaryen (L+R=J), and Tyrion is possibly the chimera offspring of the mad king making his Targaryen-ness (making up words) possible. This could lead to them being the three heads of the dragon, and possibly the three rulers of the whole damn known world. Of course none of this will happen until they battle all of the nonsense over the wall. But once that is taken care of I believe that Jon will tear down the wall (or melt it with dragon fire), reclaim the north as its own kingdom once again, and rule as king of the north and everything that was beyond the wall including the freefolk. Then instead ofDanny claiming Westeros as her kingdom, I find it more possible that she will restore Valyria and rule there. And finally Tyrion will rule over Westeros. He has shown before that he can do a good job at running the kingdom back when he was Joffery's hand.

Just a fun idea I've tossing around. Please feel free argue with me. I enjoy a good GOT debate.",15,9,False,self,,,,,

&gt; I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, oh, I woke from terror.

Is this a piece of foreshadowing for the Red Wedding? When I read this I thought of Cat. The roaring river could be the Freys' betrayal (their sigil is the Twins with the river between them) and the fish would be Cat, whose house has a fish for its sigil. The red tears could be from the crying of seeing what happened to Robb and when she opens her eyes could refer to her resurrection as Lady Stoneheart (haven't read that part yet, so I might be wrong).

Also, what so you guys think the rest could mean?

&gt;I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye. I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.

The first part seems to refer to Renly's murder. What is the part about the crow?

Will I be just as captivated?",27,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;

In the first or second episode, Jon is not allowed to sit at the high table, as seating a bastard with the royal children would be an insult. (All the royal children are they themselves, bastards.)

&amp;nbsp;

The fantastic conversation between Robert and Cersei about their marriage, struck me as Cersei saying goodbye to Robert, as at this point she has decided to have Robert offed. In particular, Cersei's asking about Lyanna for the first time hammered this home.

&amp;nbsp;

In season two, Cersei remarks about Tyrion ""shipping Myrcella off in a crate,"" exactly how Tyrion leaves King's Landing.

&amp;nbsp; 

After Robb and his bannermen learn of Theon's betrayal, Roose Bolton remarks about how the ""Greyjoys are all treacherous bastards"" or something to that effect, and we all know where Roose goes from there.

Obviously there have been leaks from the set showing new events, but I can't help but feel that this path of almost ""stalling"" might be better for the series in order to more accurately portray TWOW when it releases.

- How does it work? How does the Many-Faced God picks the assassination victims? Is it so that whoever comes and drinks from the fountain can ask for a favor in return?
- Why is the existence of the House of Black &amp; White (bunch of assassins really) tolerated in the free cit of Braavos?
- If they only kill jerks, how come there are still jerks in Braavos? As it seems that every Braavosi knows about them I would presume they would all be afraid.
- After Arya is given the  ""gift"" for the thin man, the following exchange takes place between the Waif and Jaqen H'ghar.

    **The Waif**: *She is not ready.*

    **Jaqen H'ghar**: *Perhaps she is. Perhaps she is not.*

Because, really. Why would she know high valerian? What kind of noble education did she get during her lifetime? 
True, she was born a princess, but she left for essos almost immidiately after being born. Her childhood education would've taken place at the 'house with red door' but her educator was a westerosi knight, not targarian nobility. She lived most of her life in various free cities. 
I think her native tongue is actually low valerian, since that's the language she usually spoke when living in the various free cities. That's why she understood low valerian in Astapor. 
She would've learned common tongue at the house with the red door, and that's the language she speaks with her brother. She's bilingual in both low valerian and common tongue. 
I can't see how she would've learned high valerian. Viscerys might have been educated in high valerian as a child, but not Danny. Even Viscerys will not be good at high valerian since he was very little when he left his family. 
I suspect Danny just learned high valerian in the free cities, like any other noble ladies in the free cities. She's probably not as good as she claims. It's not her 'mother tongue'",14,0,False,self,,,,,

Ned begs to spare the innocent life of this girl he's never even seen or had any relationship to, even going so far as to resign as Hand in protest. His honor is unwavering.

In season 5, Stannis, also an honorable man, is ultimately faced with the exact dillemna as Ned - whether or not to kill a young innocent princess to save tens of thousands. Only his test is more personal because the princess is his own daughter. And yet Stannis makes the opposite choice as Ned, to make the sacrifice.

Should be introduced at the begining of the book, I felt really stupid and only when I was on chapter 13 was when I realized there was a lack of something (the other characters)... 

Now for the people who have read it... Spoilers ahead

When I started I had read about Brienne and how a lot of people hate her chapters and considered them boring, for me were one of the best, gives you a great point of view about what's going on in other parts of westeros and how the smallfolk struggle... I loved the Iron islands Plot even more because it was finally something completely new for me (read books after tv-show), the last chapter of dorne exploted inside me the image I had for Doran and made me respect him, after I thought he was a 'bad pussay' at the begining when I thought he was tywin's lickspittle. The final chapters had lot of surprises, Cersei was my least favorite chapters, only because he's so fuking dumb, reminds me of sansa's AGOT but more cringy because she's supposed to be a grown woman... But I gotta say the sparrows - Margaery plot made much more sense in the book compared to the show... and so did Jamie...


And that's it, I just wanted to vent, now I'm so hyped for finally reaching A dance with dragons :D


**PS:** quoting 'Meanwhile back on the wall...':


&gt;all the rest of the characters
you love or love to hate will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons,
which will focus on events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present book focused on
Kings Landing.
