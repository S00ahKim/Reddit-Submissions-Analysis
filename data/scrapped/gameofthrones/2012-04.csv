He did this so he can have Catelyn Tully's hand in marriage by removing Eddard ""Ned"" Stark. He did this by leading Jon Arryn into discovering that the heirs to the Iron Throne are bastards. I'm assuming Littlefinger found this information somehow. He then has Lysa Tully poison him and write to her sister Catelyn Tully that the Lannisters were behind it. Petyr Baelish also sends an assassin to kill Bran with an unique dagger. He then told her that the dagger used in the attack belonged to Tyrion Lannister.     

Robert Baratheon chooses Ned Stark as the new Hand of the King. Ned Stark finds the same information. Confronts the Queen over it. King Robert is assassinated by the Queen. Joffery is crowned King and should have sent Ned to the Wall but beheads him instead enraging House Stark into rebellion. 

Just some questions:

-Why orchestrate such a complex plan that would at least pit House Stark and House Lannister against each other just to get Catelyn Tully on the rebound as a grieving widow? Why not just assassinate Ned like the Lannisters assassinated Robert Baratheon and make it look like an accident? That way you won't have the potential of civil war and you have a now single and emotionally fragile Catelyn Tully that you can try to court. How it turned out is an enraged Catelyn Tully hellbent on waging war on the Lannisters. Now maybe Littlefinger didn't know Joffery would execute Ned Stark instead of sending him to the Wall. But it just feels weird that such a supposedly great [Chessmaster](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) would leave something like that open to chance.       

-How did Littlefinger know that the Lannisters would kill Robert Baratheon? If Robert got back alive from his hunting trip, he would have taken Ned's side and there would be no chance that the Iron Throne would declare Ned a traitor.   

-Just my observation but even if starting a civil war to get the woman you want works. It's still a freaking civil war. Who knows what might have happened. His own lands or Catelyn Tully's might get invaded and ravaged. He or Catelyn might die in the fighting. This is why I felt a simple assassination to make it like an accident is the best way to get rid of Ned Stark instead of starting a civil war. And it should have also been oblivious to supposedly such a smart and cunning character.    ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Well I had some fun making these so I hope you like them r/got, I'm not an artist so they are obviously far from perfect.

I quite like seeing how other people have envisioned these characters we all love/hate- so how did I do? Anything in particular that looks very different from how you pictured it?

In Season 2 however I was blown away with how much they seem to have spent on it. You can tell the budget was much higher, it feels like you are watching a movie rather than a show.

For instance, I think the scene in Season 1 when [TV Spoiler](/s ""Arya stabs the stableboy who wants to turn her over to Cersei"") didn't play out as good as it could have. It was too sudden and didn't mean very much at all to the viewer. However in Season 2 when [TV Spoiler](/s ""they take Robert's bastard baby from the whore, it was really tense and the atmosphere was brilliant."") Both scenes should have had a similar tone and build-up in my opinion.

The first episode or two of Season 1 were quite confusing, but by the time we hit the second or third episode we had completely absorbed the characters and the world surrounding them.

This means that the impact of the burning of the seven and the maester's actions will, in retrospect, increase as the season develops.

The Davos/Stannis/Melisandre scenes were no more rushed than the Season 1 episodes, and I seem to recall fans of the book were making these exact criticisms when Season 1 first premiered.  And those concerns were blown away, as they will be in Season 2!",9,16,False,default,,,,,

I really feel that, having read the books, (wellll....I'm halfway through ADWD) which are so almost over-rich in detail, and put you on such intimate terms with a myriad of characters- that I'm just absolutely finding the television show so much richer than I did last season, not having read a sentence.

 The television series and the ever-happening world of the novels have an interesting effect on each other- on the whole, I *think* I actually enjoy neither the books nor the show more, but the actual experience of **watching the story I've spent so much time with personally** take shape on the television. It's amazing to watch them flesh out Martin's words visually in those beautiful jewel-tones and, it-should-be-said, their incredibly talented art department, not the mention the cast of gorgeous people. It feels like the show takes GRRM's story and illuminates it, kind of like a stained glass window with light pouring through it. 
Plus I love the anticipation of seeing who's going to be cast as who as the season goes on...

Thoughts? Any little things you noticed last night that you've been pouring over all day?

* Pyke and Dragonstone in the intro. Awesome! Did you notice how the bridges on Pyke bounce and sway? Such a cool little detail.

* The actors playing Arya and Gendry have such a great rapport. I was laughing out loud. Also Jaquen was pretty hot.

* Tyrion and Cersei are also great together. It seems the actors have really had time to grow into their roles and their characters' relationships, and everything feels much more genuine and natural so far this season.

* Samwell continues to be adorable, and I like the casting choice for Gilly. Pretty enough but awkward.  

* Theon and Asha (I refuse to call her Yara). I've read the books, knew who she was, and found it all horribly awkward and awesome. Cannot wait to watch it again with the non-readers.

* Also Pyke itself was beautifully done. The kraken fireplace was a great touch.

* Salador Saan, the first black man in Westeros!

* I wasn't too crazy about Melisandre in episode 1 - she seemed too matronly, not the seductive enchantress we get in the books. However, I think I've now changed my mind.

Not so crazy about:

* THAT was Hot Pie? I never thought he'd be so fat and toady... 

* Scene between Littlefinger and Roz seemed very out of place.

* Jon Snow seems far less sympathetic when you're not getting the story from his PoV. He just comes across as a jerk.

* I still don't think Craster looks icky enough. This is a guy who fucks his own daughters and murders his sons, he shouldn't look so much like a cheerful grandfather/soccer coach. I always pictured him looking more like [Argus Filch](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0103195/) from Harry Potter.

* And just like in the books, NEEDS MOAR DANY!

With the premiere episode showing her taking on more an ""assistant manager"" role for Little Finger, it's looking like she may end up replacing Chataya. 

If that's the case I'm going to guess that her ""exotic"" colleague (the one who pretends to not speak common tongue, and had the 'performance lesson' with Ros in season 1) will take on the roll of Alayaya. In fact, I could be wrong, but I don't think that character has even been given a name yet, so she could actually end up being called Alayaya.

I'm calling it now, the unnamed ""exotic"" sex worker colleague from flea bottom is going to be the one Tyrion uses as a cover, and who then gets kidnapped by Cersei and flogged at Tywin's command. I'm making this prediction here, not so I can later say ""I told you so"" as much as to give others the opportunity to rub it in face if I'm wrong.

He's obviously miserable, and he has pretty quickly watched all of the unwatched episodes of the shows he likes from his DVR. 

I told him that he needs to watch Game of Thrones but his response was that ""he's not in to fantasy."" I tried to tell him that the show has much more in common with Richard III (he was an English major with a focus in Shakespeare) and Wagner's Ring Cycle than it does with Lord of the Rings. I've also tried to explain to him that the show is in many ways a retelling of the Wars of the Roses and the Mongol invasions all smushed in to one (he's kind of a history buff too). 

My question is, does anyone have any good reviews of the show that: 1) frame the show in terms of this literary/historical heritage; 2) come from a source that my father is likely to find reputable (NYRB, LRB, NYTimes, etc.); and 3) don't have too many spoilers?

Personally, I don't like to watch the episodes early (and I could if I wanted to, since I have HBO GO) because I have watch parties every Sunday, and surely many people feel the same way. Part of the fun is going in knowing absolutely nothing about the content of that week's episode. It's really frustrating to visit /r/gameofthrones and hope to see new content about the first episode, but instead having to see discussion posts or image macros taken from the second episode. 

At the very, very least, can you be absolutely certain to put [episode 2.2] or something similar in the title. If I don't see any indication that an image or a post is from an unaired episode, I'll just assume it is about the episode that has just aired on HBO. I try to avoid all spoilers/content for future episodes, and if HBO continues to release episodes early, I can see how this subreddit can get out of hand and become a huge clusterfuck that might cater more toward people who skip ahead and watch episodes released on HBO GO before they air on HBO.

I hope this doesn't come across as mean or whiny or whatever, but I just kind of wanted to get some feedback on how other people felt about the issue, Ultimately, I know this is a large subreddit and people are going to post what they want to post and there's really nothing to be done about it. I just wanted to express my concern and my hope that the subreddit doesn't start getting too saturated with content from episodes that a good portion of people can't watch or choose not to watch.

It was as if the music was a mourning for the Old Gods, for the abandonment of their old ways, and this destructive fearsome new religion was overshadowing it all.

It's probably been the only time in a tv show that I've ever noticed some sort of communication of the story through the music; instead of just getting you riled up in suspense or thrills. It made me quite sad.

It's an insufferable irritation for Chessman Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), supporting Baelish's knowledge that her son, Joffrey (Jackass Gleeson) the golden-haired and black-hearted scion of incest, is no rightful reverend at all. She responds by touching a knife to Baelish's throat.

""Cause is state,"" she spits gage. But the threat is sufficiency, she figures, and Baelish lives to strategy another day.

Dominicus's installment, ""The Northern Remembers,"" is ladened of much concealed truths reticulate with brutality. Symmetric for the viewer, with far many perspective than any of the characters, uncertainness is the thought. (A loose chronology and added scenes keep those who've show Martyr R. R. Bishop's product broadcast on their toes as fine.)

There are now threesome challengers to Choreographer. Renly Baratheon, the saxist upstart who doesn't get an feigning, looms formidably with a Southern gray.

The fan loved is Robb Stark (Richard Madden), the princely Eddard (Sean Bean)'s rimy inheritance, who has won threesome battles to unloosen the statesman.

Robb appears in the exclusive axiomatic misstep of the broadcast, as the difficult rendering of his direwolf, Hoary Thread, snaps menacingly at the captured Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). The savage is not only understandably fake, but his presence suggests Robb's insecurity in a way that's abstracted in the assemblage.

Meantime, on the island of Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon (Stephan Dillane), probably has the most true assert to the vest as the slain Parliamentarian's issue crony, but with a impaired organization, he turns to a new faith.

Stannis debuts amid a conflagration of the Cardinal, symbols of Westeros' infidel polytheism, in relic of singular love of the red god espoused by the tempting Melisandre (Carice van Houten), the establishment's flame-haired priestess.

Again, verity -- in this frame, the discourse of the right god -- is subsidiary to promises of land.

Maester Cressen (Jazzman Water Davies), a sincere adorer of the Digit, urges Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham), Stannis' smuggler-turned-knight, to support up for the conservative god.

""If you carried the statement..."" says Cressen.

""What's the statement?"" replies Davos, unemotional.

Parenthesis from his supple worship, Stannis comes off as dour and unrelenting, but transmitter to the powers of plot. He dictates a missive with exactness, vocation Jaime both ""Kingslayer"" and ""Ser."" And when questions of alliance get up, he is unyielding.

""They're all thieves,"" says Stannis. ""I leave undo them.""

Vocalist's broadcast is dignified by unflinching horror of vivification and decease, from the butchery of Magnate Parliamentarian's bastards to the cyclical incest of Craster (Parliamentarian Pugh), who fathers daughters from his own daughters in the boreal wilderness.

Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and Jon Downfall (Kit Harington) seize with unpleasant surround of alter and poet -- despite their early triumphs, they rest shackled by their locations and remain on the boundary to the drama at curtilage.

The most reigning man in the orbit is now Tyrion Lannister (Apostle Dinklage), the battle-hardened new Applause of the Mogul. His new point -- and striking property in the impart's credits -- echoes that of Ned, but he is subtle where Ned was change, unreal when Ned was credulous.

But Tyrion displays a similar marking of compassion, a density in Tycoon's Construction -- he offers his sympathies to Sansa Stark (Sophie Painter) for Ned's end and genuinely loves his younger nephew and niece. His relationship with Cersei is combatative and oxyacetylene by the ascendancy of their ancestor, Tywin Lannister (Physicist Saltation).

""It moldiness be brutal for you to be the unsatisfying juvenile,"" Tyrion remarks during their premiere breakfast,

But when experience is a frontage, a infinitesimal man's overlook can hulk spacious indeed.

Buoyed by the sureness instilled by its massively booming over weaken, the mollify opener for Gamy Of Thrones mollify two showed less want to cooperation. By the period the primo move of an period had destroyed by, we'd had killings, status, sex, the kill of a babe (a genuinely lousy, jaw-dangling moment, one that thankfully occurred off camera), along with current war, and the pass hope of more engagement real understandably around the structure.

We all remember book 5 and how it was going to be out quicker, and it took almost 7 to 8 years. I may not be a pessimist but lets look at the speed of how long most of the sequels took. around 2 to 3 years. This isn't counting the fact that even after its done has to go through editors, reviews, and in the case of the HBO tv show it needs to be filmed and that usually takes 6 to 8 months.

There are suppose to be 7 books which right now most people can't see it happening depending on how GRRM wraps up all the loose ends and ties together it. So unless he pulls a two part Robert Jordan. Aka he dies, or he says well shit I have to add another book, ah crap or another one what will happen when the TV show hits the brick wall of no more books to pull its story from. TV audiences will no be happy with, HEY YOU GUYS NEED TO WAIT UNTIL THE AUTHOR FINISHES THE NEXT BOOK, does HBO have the rights to finish the books via story for GRRM kind of like what they did with Dexter? If he dies will they just cancel it an say smeh sorry too bad so sad?

If it has grown in popularity to say SOPRANO's level does anyone have any speculation or hard fact of what will happen?  I always think about it because 5 years to finish 2 books seems awfully cutting it close.

Then Game of Thrones aired on HBO and I was interested but it wasn't must see for me. My girlfriend's mother sent me the first three (maybe four, can't remember now) books and it seemed more like a burden than anything since it was a gift and I felt obliged to read them. I finally bit the bullet and started reading a game of thrones. Holy shit was that book good but a clash of kings seems to take this to a whole other level. The twisting, winding plot, subplots, backstabbing, political chessmatches, real characters and so much else is so ridiculous in a great way. 

Basically, I'm glad winter is here and I can't wait to see what the rest of this and the other three books have in store. I just hope some of my favorite characters stick around but Martin spares no one as I have already learned. ",31,9,False,self,,,,,

If HBOGo continues to air episodes much earlier to places like Poland (which is what I'm lead to believe will happen), then most fans will watch the episode ASAP (not on TV) rather than waiting a week.

This obviously equates to HBO directly losing viewers.

Does anybody have any idea as to why the series cannot be aired simultaneously on the same day everywhere; give or take hours for time zones.

This would ensure maximum audience numbers, as there would be no need to pirate copies, other than the small majority who do not have access to HD versions on TV and therefore find them elsewhere.

Thoughts?

Edit: grammar.

[Speculation](/g ""This might seem to be the end for him, but I'm thinking GRRM is setting him up for some bigger things in future books. Here's how I see things playing out: Jon is resurrected by Melisandre, much like Beric Dondarrion was resurrected several times by Thoros of Myr. Having died, Jon is free oath to the Night's watch ""...now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death"". He leaves the Night's Watch, and either joins up with Stannis, or takes command of Stannis's broken army, depending on whether Ramsay Bolton was telling the truth in his letter to Jon about defeating Stannis. One way or another, I'm thinking Stannis ends up dead, but, before he dies, he makes Jon legitimate. With Jon in command of a northern army, the armies of the Vale join their power to him, per Sansa's upcoming marriage. Robb's letter naming Jon his heir somehow turns up, giving him extra credibility.
Throughout the books, there has been a recurring allusion to the ""Three-headed dragon"" that is the Targaryen sigil, but is also a manifestation of Targaryen power. Aegon is the first head of the dragon. Daenerys is the second. Jon is the third. At some point, Jon talks with Howland Reed and he reveals the secret of his birth: he is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. He is therefore both the heir to the northern kingdom, and is third in line to the throne of the Seven Kingdoms as a whole.

But now this second season is starting and now people everywhere are watching! That is NOT what I signed up for. I AM NOT watching some mainstream shit that millions of people love. NOPE NOPE NOPE!

And now in Reddit comments people are making Game of Thrones references?? Hello people?? Can you be more LAMEstream? (I meant mainstream, get it?)

It seems like the area maintains a temperature at or near freezing, +- ten degrees.

Starting in the prologue of the first book, there is talk of ""a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men.""  In the second book, there are descriptions of Night's Watchmen crossing rivers swollen by six day's worth of ""warm rain"" that turned the ground into ""soft mud.""  The wall will weep sometimes as well, when the day's temperature gets warm enough to begin melting some of the ice.  On top of this, farming goes on in the gift just south of the Wall, meaning that the area can't be permanently buried in snow.  

To me, it seems like the area is harsh, but livable, and not nearly as snow-packed as the TV series would lead you to believe.  The area is rapidly cooling as winter is approaching, when the real nasty snows will come, but until then things are just bitter.  What do you guys think?  Quotes from the books are appreciated :)

First of all the show has ZERO subtlety. Things that are cleverly implied in the books are shoved in our faces. Stannis and Melisandre, Crasters Sons, the murder of Roberts Bastards, and the Queen searching for Gendry. None of these are explicitly said in the book. For example, it isn't initially clear who the gold cloaks are looking for, Arya or Gendry. The show makes so many unnecessary and grating changes. Take for example, the final scene of episode 2. In ACOK, there is no contacts between the NW and the Others. Why change it? Why show us the Others? Why have Jon Snow be discovered by Craster after watching him sacrifice a child (something  else that is also not explicitly shown in the books)? This completely changes the dynamic of the relationship between Craster and the NW. Instead of Craster begrudgingly helping them, it's likely now that he openly hostile to them, or at least Jon Snow. Jon Snow will now have to be punished by Mormont, which also changes the relationship. Another change is the addition of copious amounts of sex. In the first season and the books, the sexuality does seem a bit excessive at times, but the second season goes to far. It's bordering on smut. There's a difference between being unflinching of sexuality and  throwing sex at our faces. Reptarftw said it best: ""All this extra sex that isn't in the books is just getting fucking stupid, to be honest. The book had enough sex to meet HBO's quota, easily. Now, they're just using up valuable screen time for little exposition. As a fan of the books, it's frustrating. They could use these precious minutes to fit in more valuable dialogue, backstory...but it's just sex, sex, sex even when it wasn't in the books. Doesn't add anything.""  Another change they made is the addition of the character Rose, who's annoying and adds nothing to the plot.
Also, all the clever dialogue and wordplay from the book has been whittled down to thinly veiled threats.  The subtlety of the books is not in the show. 
**TL;Dr**: this season is disappointing due to copious amounts of unneeded sex and unnecessary changes that add nothing, and sometimes even detract.
IF you have a different opinion, explain why in the comments, instead of simply downvoting
**Edit**: Some very good points have been made. I probably shouldn't expect a scene for scene adaptations, and shouldn't pick apart small things. Also I should probably wait at least halfway through the season before I pass judgment. ",11,0,False,default,,,,,

Before it started I was really looking forward to:

* Davos
* Pod (though his time will definitely come)
* Balon and Yara Greyjoy

What I loved about Davos was his, I'm just a simple man and I'll speak the truth to a king surrounded by people trying to please him with lies. In the show, his devotion to Stannis almost reads as cockiness. Pod's role has been non-existent thus far. Balon and Yara just seemed smarmy to me. I imagined fierce, deadly, people enraged by Robb's proposal. Balon and Yara instead came across, to me, as like a cross between the Malfoys and the Dursleys. 

So far, however, these are my favorite characters:

* Tyrion (duh)
* Varys (I can't wait to see more of him with Tyrion)
* Gendry (I forgot how great he was with Arya... I mean... with m'lady)
* Salladhor Saan (Never expected him to be as hilarious as he was in Ep. 2)

Having read the books, the best part of the show, for me, is watching what they change and how the characters come to life visually. Some of them are being done poorly in my mind and some are better than the book even. I'm still very excited to see Jaqen H'ghar get out of his cage. The Red Priestess sleeping with Stannis, is incredibly intriguing. I want to see her shadows before counting her as a great character. And of course there is still Brienne, hopefully Meera, Margaery, Ygritte, and I'd love to see Damphair and Victarion if only for a bit.

What's everyone else thinking?

Edit: One thing I meant to add/ask, was how every thought the wolves were going? The CGI looks a bit off, especially compared to the dragons. But I like that they seem to be a constant presence unlike last series where they were almost reduced to a Deus Ex Machina device.",8,7,False,self,,,,,

The character that I found the most difficult to grasp, as I'm sure is the case with a lot of readers, was Theon. On the one hand, I can empathize with his inner conflict of being caught between two families, neither of which he really belongs to anymore. I see what he is doing by trying to take Winterfell--he wants to show his father that he is truly Ironborn and no better way to do so than to take the house where he was held hostage for nine years. It's also nice to see that he realizes how foolish of a choice it was but he pushes onward always, despite his misgivings. On the other hand, I really want to smack his dick off for what he did to the Starks. I realize that he was never a ""ward"" as Ned always called him; he was more hostage than ward. But he was raised with the Stark children and Robb considered him a brother. He saved Bran's life once and to turn around and take Winterfell for himself while it was guarded by women and old men just seems despicable to me. Gods, he fucked a wench in Ned Stark's own bed. I don't hate Theon as I do Joffrey or Cersei but I really can't wrap my head around him, he's an incredibly complex character and I'm excited to see the role he plays in future books. Well done with this one, GRRM. 
**TL;DR**-I get that Theon has daddy issues, but he's acting like a huge twat. ",14,8,False,self,,,,,

**Please limit your responses to only the first season/first book.**

One scene that comes to mind is Jaime and his men attacking Ned and his men outside of Littlefinger's brothel. He only ordered his men in the books, but I liked the way that he fought himself in the series. Specifically how he was the one to kill Jory. It really made the whole situation even more personal than it already was, and showed how ruthless and skilled the Kingslayer really is. Really gave you more reason to hate him.

Specifically John Snow.

After watching the few fighting scenes that they have him in i realized why i thought it felt wrong.  In the books when I read them every fight seemed fluid, like a dance almost; which is exactly like how sword fighting really is.

But in the show it seems clunky and the moves and counters seem more like those between two people who have never held a sword and are both scared of the opponents abilities.

The reason John's abilities bother me is because he seems overly built and aggressive compared to his lithe and agile frame the books portrayed.  Normally he was calculating and effective with his speed, and only occasionally would he flat out overpower his opponent.  But in the show he would use his strength to beat down his opponent and toss them over his shoulder...WHY!!!!  It was wrong.

Also the Nights Watch. They look extremely bulky with how massive their cloaks look massive (Sam is supposed to be but I digress).  This adds to how wrong John looks along with most of the rangers who are supposed to be like hunters and in my own opinion sneaky.  

Any one wanna enlighten me id appreciate it.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I can only assume that I'm not the only one who has had something spoiled either by accident or carelessness by the reader or poster. Sometimes spoilers might not be tagged and sometimes people drop hints to future events and characters without putting tags and this can be enough to figure out what's going to happen.

This is the main reason I would like to start this sub-reddit as a safe haven for viewers of he show that have not read the books. So that people like myself can browse without being worried about spoilers.

I would really like to make this sub-reddit and as I'm new to Reddit I would like to know how or if someone else more experienced could start it, even better!

The main rule for this sub-reddit would be obviously no spoilers about anything that has not yet happened in the series or providing links to articles that have book spoilers

Also I would like this sub-reddit to be about discussions and questions people have about the series and interesting posts and not just linking events of series/books to memes. So I would like to ban those kinds of posts.

So what do you think? Please don't hesitate to share your opinion. Do you agree or disagree? Tell me what other rules should added/removed.

First, my nerdcred: I'm a classic geek and love lotr, star wars, star trek, grew up playing command and conquer and warcraft (I stay away from WoW though) and I've been to comicon, dragoncon, and other conventions.  I could go on but I am clearly the demographic GoT is targeting.    

A friend of mine introduced me to the series a couple weeks ago.  I've watched the first 7 episodes or so and each one is more excruciatingly bad than the one before.  The following is as clear and concise a list as I can manage to compile detailing why I believe the HBO series Game of Thrones is just an astonishingly bad series:

--------------------------------

* first and foremost, the primary reason why it is unwatchable for me: I simply do not care about any of the characters the slightest little bit.  Absolutely nothing in the series has happened yet to make me care about any single one of them.  Every character speaks with this same wooden monotone voice of impending doom.  They wear these elaborate costumes, and walk around expensive sets, and talk and talk and talk, and they never do anything or expose any humanity.  Remember the Star Wars prequels, remember how bad they were?  Remember how boring Amidala, Qui Gon, Mace Windu, and Obi Wan were?  They wore costumes and walked around elaborate sets and never actually did or said anything interesting.  

* speaking of elaborate sets, the art direction and set design and costumes are brilliant!  Really.  But nothing interesting involving them ever happens.  A kid was thrown from a window, a knight got his throat cut, and there was an elaborate fight scene on behalf of the dwarf, and that's pretty much it.  I still don't care about any of them, and don't know why I should.  I don't know what their dreams and hopes are, what their strengths and weaknesses are, what good they've done, what evil they've done and are capable of...Watch the show again: you'll notice that pretty much EVERY scene is ""camera A, camera B, camera A, camera B, over his shoulder, over her shoulder...walking and talking...sitting and talking...standing and talking...more talking...ok they're in the woods now...more talking......"" and nothing ever happens

* the sets and money in this show, also the frequent boobs, are like jingling keys in front of a toddler.  It's offensive.  If you're going to use impressive effects and sets and costumes, you need story and drama to back it up.  Money only goes so far.

* cliches: there's the badass swordsman in the north by the wall.  He's the aragorn character, clearly, because he looks dashing and heroic in his costume and he's real good at fighting.  He's probably got a good heart.  Hey look, there's the king - he's old and past his prime and waxes on about days past.  And the little girl who wants to become a great swordswoman?  She even got her own training montage showing her getting better!  (That was the end of episode 3 I think)  The dwarf is the only remotely interesting character and I'm not sure how interesting he would be if he were...er, average sized.

* the women: the women are written exceptionally poorly.  Have you seen Rome?  Attia of the Julii is a perfect example of a well written female character.  She used her sexuality and power to manipulate people to get what she wants.  She was imperfect, quite a bitch actually, and had people killed, and used people, but as an audience we sympathized with her position because we knew we would act the same.  In GoT the women are all talking mannequins.  The blond girl with the tribal outlaw guys has zero personality.  (That big tribal outlaw guy is totally technoviking btw) The queen and mother of that little blond dickling who looks like Drako Malfoy is a walking cliche too.  And like I said before, that little girl even got a montage as we see her getting a bit better at swordplay.

* the nudity and sex is not sexy or interesting at all.  So far there's been some nudity in pretty much every episode.  It feels like they filmed the episode first, and then went over it looking for a scene where they could throw in some boobs just to make us nerdy white fanboyz happy.  It feels weird and wrong and out of place like they're just manipulating my genitals for ratings.  

* finally, when some action does happen, it's just an elaborately choreographed fight scene with lots of blood and gore and cinematic effects we've been seeing for decades now.  They don't do anything clever or creative with the characters, settings, history or politics.  It's the same old power struggle, the same boy meets girl, the same heroes fighting the same villains, and everyone LOOKS exactly the way their character prototype is supposed to look.  Nobody in this series is dynamic or conflicted!  I don't understand anyone's motivations.  They just go through the motions as if everyone's read the script and they just want to get done filming it already.  I want to see people being people!  I want to see a mostly good person do something really shitty.  I want to see a kind-of-bad person do something really good.  I want people to be thrust into difficult or impossible situations and see what kind of choices they make under the circumstances.  I want to sympathize with them.  But I can't, because they are all walking cliches delivering lines in wooden uninspired voices via ""camera A, camera B"" shoulder over shoulder narration.

-----------------------------------
The list goes on and on but that's the best I can do at the moment.  I want to emphasize that I have not read the books and I am solely judging the tv series on its own.

In fact she'd have been there when Tyrion stopped by Winterfell offering the plan for Brans saddle and perhaps even realised Tyrion was not a bad guy.

Jamie might not have attacked Ned, Ned would not have sent personal guards away or have lost his men.  Granted he might have still looked into Jon Arryns death but Robert may not have left the city to go hunting because of all the stress the Lannisters and Starks were putting him in.  Which means he might have been in the city when Ned wanted to tell him about the bastard children.  Perhaps still in charge when the nights watch called for help from the others.

Seems to me Joffrey has been the lovely little butterfly that has completely screwed up the Seven Kingdoms and caused a massive chain of events that killed thousands.
That got me thinking that there must have been so many other minute events GRRM created where if one tiny event had gone differently the entire story would be completely different.",13,2,False,self,,,,,

For me in Season 1 it was just unbelievable how they could cast Jamie,Tyron, and so many of the Starks perfectly but then bomb so bad on Cersei. If you've really read ALL the books before you know that there is no way she looks the way she's supposed to. Okay I get it, its a show and you can't re-create everything; Tyrion isn't very ugly, Daenerys doesn't have purple eyes, and Varys looks and sounds like a child molester. I can live with most of it and still enjoy HBO's vision of a world we have a lot of investment in.


But Season 2 Episode 2 hath taken no mercy on my poor soul and cast Asha Greyjoy. 


http://gameofthronesrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/greyjoys.jpg


This will always be more or less my vision of Asha (maybe a little more charisma). 


http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6gVvTqYDunM/Txr5SzpVewI/AAAAAAAABKc/XtEtxggYGcs/s1600/Asha+Greyjoy+%2528AToB%2529.jpg


Asha is a tomboy, an independent Vixen, and smarter than most of the men on the Iron islands. She commands ships and men in battle, and doesn't shy away from death. She even has the balls to take her chances in the Kingsmoot. I just don't see that permeating fully out of the current casting choice. For some reason I'm not going to be able to believe her character when she's shouting orders at men and trying to plant an axe in some ones head. Doesn't mean the actress can't wow me and change my mind either. Brieene of Tarth is also a great character, but leaves more room for an eccentric casting choice, you'll see next episode.  

I just wanted to know if other avid fans of the books seem to have a disconnect with certain characters and a new version of others. 

With SOOO many more important characters coming I just don't want to see the same happen to people like Thoros, Qhorin Halfhand, Yigrette, Mance, the Reed's, Stong Belwas, and Dario. ",3,0,False,default,,,,,

Everyone's read them. But one time, David Benioff and Dan Weiss sent a script out to everyone and they sent a different one to Alfie Allen. They put a new scene in it in which Theon is murdered in a particularly grisly way. They waited to see what Alfie thought of him being killed off so soon when he thought he'd be doing it for [a longer period of time]. So for about a day, Alfie thought his character was being killed off, but it was only in his script did they put that scene. I think they should have made him film it first and then told him the truth.

where this scene comes in the book it seemed a little odd. it's so close to the somewhat shocking ending of the book that it just sort of stood out to me, and it's been making me wonder what the point is. 

Is he just dying of poor health or is there more to it.

Okay, so where I find this the most interesting is that he is Tommen's food taster (to prevent something like what happened to Joffery happening), and has been for some time at that point.

I'd like to welcome anyone to share any feelings or thoughts they have towards not liking certain aspects of the show. I think it's fair that we can discuss this without people giving us too much of a hard time. None of these things are enough to ruin the show for me, but I'd still like to open a dialogue as to how people would maybe improve it themselves, or what they don't like.

1. I've said it before and I'll say it again. I hate Tywin not being bald, that is something that stood out more than almost anything about the books. Him not doing things in half measures -edit- IN LIFE, the performance is spectacular, no complaints there.-end edit- says so much about his character. Of course, I can live with it, it's just one of my gripes.

2. I really dislike Emilia Clarke's performance. I don't know if it's the direction she's getting, I find her incredibly whiny, and she forces emotion everytime she speaks. It turns me right off.

3. I really dislike the woman playing Melisandre, I feel like she's wooden and not drawing from the pool of crazy that she could to play melisandre. I thought the scene with her on the beach preaching to the lord of light was incredibly down played. Maybe it was direction again, either way I thought it would be cooler if she was a bit more fanatical. That's always how I pictured her.

Aside from my bitching there are so many things I love about the show. I think Nicolaj Coster-Waldau is doing way better this season than he was last, I can't wait for his character arc to continue. All the greyjoy stuff is way better than I could have imagined it, I can't wait to see Theon's character arc as well. Tyrion, Cersei, joffrey, arya, all of them are great, and I'm thrilled to be watching. How about you guys?",188,29,False,self,,,,,

Suggestions for background music?

I have a clear image of a completely different world in my head, and I know it just as well as I do this one - it's amazing actually, because I've never really been into books. I mean, how boring would the books be if Martin refused to describe anything?

I'm not an experienced flash developer by any means, so still trying to figure things out. So far only replaced a few images and music. Still scanning through episodes trying to find more suitable images or sequences. Did not ask for permission from the flash site or this subreddit for using the shields image, which I can substitute with something else if it's not cool.

After a few seconds of loading, [**right click and choose play**](http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1334442502)

(I don't know why it does this.)

What do you think? Should I keep going? The game is free to play on their site so it *seems* ok to modify it.

And if so, would any one like to help? I am not as knowledgeable of the story as most of you, so any suggestions of cool dialogue between cut scenes or better footage would be greatly appreciated. 

So far I plan to just have Arya slap Cersei, Joffrey then Jamie. If none if this makes sense let me know. It might also be great just to have something where you can just slap Joffrey non stop.

My main hope is that this can be something you guys will enjoy and have a laugh. If it's not cool I can take it down, but personally will keep working on it.

Things I'm working on next:

* Change flower life indicators for shields
* Get better character footage",4,4,False,self,,,,,

I think the opening credits will feature the following four locations in almost every episode:

* King's Landing
* Dragonstone
* The Wall
* A location in Slaver's Bay or possibly a generic flyover of Slaver's Bay.

In addition;

* The Twins will reappear in one or two episodes
* Harrenhal will reappear in one or two episodes
* The Eyrie might reappear in at least one episode, if they write a scene between Lysa and Littlefinger. I have a feeling Sansa won't make it there until Season 4, but the relationship between Lysa and Petyr needs explaining.

**I'm not completely rock solid on this opinion, I am open to changing it... so I'd like to have a decent discussion on it here... it has been a while since I read ACOK so perhaps I'm mistaken, please point it out if you think I am.**

**Also I'd rather not get into a debate about the show in general and how ""it's an interpretation not a direct translation"" or ""they can't fit everything in because it's a TV show, not a book"". There are plenty of parts in the show which have diverged which are completely understandable, this however is a plot change which I believe could have been avoided without costing any extra air time.**

**So, please, keep the discussion focused on Theon and how this changes/alters his character in direct comparison to the books.**

**Please don't downvote if you disagree, it makes it impossible to voice any controversial opinions.**

They did two things in this episode which set alarm bells ringing and for me they have significantly altered Theons character and my opinion of him. 

The first thing is that Balon Greyjoy states that his plan is to take the entire north. He says ""each keep will fall one by one"". If I'm not mistaken in the book Theon was commanded to raid the Stoney Shore but then took it a step further and landed his army permanently and marched to Winterfell and took it. This was entirely Theons idea and is due to the fact he feels he needs to prove himself to his family. However he later finds out when Asha Greyjoy shows up with 'reinforcements' that taking Winterfell was extremely stupid. The Iron Born have no desire to hold land in the north because they are of the sea - they distrust being so far from the ocean. She even openly mocks him for making such a stupid move which is likely going to cost him his life - then she does indeed leave him to die.

So now the second point which runs off of the first. Why on earth is the plan to take the entire North at all?! As I've mentioned Theon is openly mocked for taking Winterfell due to his lack of understanding of the Iron Born... but now we're told the plan by Lord Greyjoy himself is to take the entire North? What?

This means that when Theon does finally decide to take Winterfell to prove himself, it doesn't sound/look so stupid because his father has already indicated they intend to take it after a year or so. This means that Theons realisation when Asha shows up which is basically; [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-im2F-ziV0sk/T1UDzWJ3XKI/AAAAAAAAA0E/RgJC0VBqQCc/s1600/ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif) either won't happen at all or won't make sense. Taking Winterfell and the magnitude of both his fundamental misunderstanding of the Iron Born and his immaturity in thinking it would please his father when in fact it doesn't - and more importantly any 'true' Iron Born would know it wouldn't - are absolutely critical to Theons character.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Now that Season 2 is ramped up into full gear, the activity on this subreddit grows and grows each week. As much as we all hate when the end credits pop up each Sunday, it also means that it's time (for me, at least) to come here and discuss the episode, and the show/books in general with fellow fans.

However, this means that spoilers are more of an issue than ever. The show is introducing more and more characters that extend farther and farther into the books. By and large, this community is GREAT for protecting fans from spoilers, I can't thank you all enough for being dedicated to that.

But, for someone like me who is only through 4 out of the 5 books, when I see a spoiler tag that simply says ""Book Spoiler"", what do I really know about what's under that red wall? Is this just a ACoK spoiler, since we're watching season 2? Or could this extend into book 5? Maybe a certain conversation is getting into AFfC material, and people are using ""AFfC spoiler"" tags, but then suddenly one person just uses a ""Book Spoiler"" tag. Now I really don't know if the material is AFfC stuff, or maybe extending into ADWD. I think you get my point?

I think the problem is, on the sidebar the example says [Book Spoiler], and then people think that they need to type Book Spoiler in order for the tag to work. ***You can type anything into those square brackets.*** **[ACoK Spoilers], [ASoS Spoilers], [ADWD Spoilers], [Deathly Hallows spoilers]**, etc etc. 

Example, \[ASoS Spoilers](/b ""I just spoiled ASoS for you, sorry"") --&gt; [ASoS Spoilers](/b ""I just spoiled ASoS for you, sorry"")

**TL;DR: Basically, please don't use ""Book Spoiler"" or ""TV Spoiler"" when creating a spoiler tag. Be more specific please! Thank you!**",22,79,False,self,,,,,

Above you'll find a link to support teams playing in the annual 826NYC Scrabble for Cheaters tournament.  Basic info: [826](http://826national.org/about) is a national nonprofit that provides tutoring for under-resourced children, primarily in the fields of writing and reading.  826 was started and is run by author [Dave Eggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers), most famous for his book A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.  Every year, the 826 New York City chapter hosts a Scrabble for Cheaters tournament to help raise money for the organization.  The money a team raises is ""spent"" on cheats such as inventing a word or using a word from another language, so the more money you give Peter Dinklage (or me, or anyone), the better chance they have of winning.  You can donate above by clicking on ""Support _____"" under the team names.  Peter Dinklage's team is called Overall Wash.  My team is called Built To Spell.  You know, if you're interested.  This is a great cause; both my girlfriend and I volunteer at 826.

By the way, regardless of how this post is received, I will be asking Dinklage about doing an AMA, and will report back with results.",12,51,False,self,,,,,

Or rather reacted to it, as I can't say with certainty that I'm right.

As Yoren fights the soldiers after taking the crossbow bolt to the shoulder, we can see pretty clearly (in my opinion) that the weapons are not even close to connecting with the person. Sadly I don't have printscreen function on this computer, but I'll try and point you to the moments I reacted on:

1. Yoren cuts the throat of two soldiers. Right before he cuts the throat of the second man he seems to parry a blow from the same guy. But the blades are not even close to touching. Or am I wrong and a total gumphumper for even pointing it out

2. As Yoren is stabbed in the back and freezes up in pain, the soldier kind of lifts him, holds him up for Amory Lorch to finally kill. But if you look at the spear of the soldier who's supposed to be holding him up, you can see pretty clearly that it is being held behind - and parallell with - the actor's body, not penetrating him.


I hope no one takes this as nitpicking for the sake of being a nitpicker, as I love the series almost as much as I love the books. I just kinda had a reaction to these things when I watched it and started obsessing over it.

So, did anyone else notice this? Or am I just delusional?


PS. Absolutely LOVED that they awesome-ified Yoren's death!

Arya is still being a badass, but recently got captured and is now headed to (???). Cersei Lannister called for all the bastards head on a stick, and commanded her men killed babies and shit. 


Robert is trying to ally with the Baratheons, in order to double his numbers and take Kings Landing. And Jon Snow is searching for his father. Am I getting all of this right, or am I mixing ish up?

In the book, the party is attacked by Amory Lorch's men, but Arya and co are captured later by Gregor's men. I think I missed something the leader said at the beginning, so he might have mentioned it then. Seeing as how they captured Arya's group right away, Lorch doesn't seem too terribly necessary. 

So assuming these are Gregor's men, who takes Needle and kills Lommy? In the books, Polliver takes Needle and Raff the Sweetling kills Lommy. My other guess is that it was the Tickler, and they just decided to condense the three (Raff doesn't do much after this, and Polliver's purpose can be served by another character) so there are less characters to keep track of.

In season one, it used to be I was in agony all week until I could see how AGOT was going to be realized int eh magical medium of television and how some of my favorite fantasy characters of the last decade were going to come to life before my very eyes. 

Sadly, the second season's first two episodes were lackluster to say the least, and the third one has just absolutely failed, in my opinion, to accurately portray the story, and also to even invoke the *spirit* of the books. 

*  Renly's grand tournament, instead of being a colorful and massive menagerie of the hundreds of different houses he has aligned to him, is instead a drab and tiny affair, with maybe (at max) a hundred spectators. And what are they even looking at? The epic melee where we see Brienne first show us her fighting mettle is now a one on one glorified sparring match with probably the most mis-cast character on the show. What the fuck happaend to the ""knights of summer""? what happened to the rainbow Kingsguard? Renly's ENTIRE claim to the throne is based on the fact that the people love him for who he is namely an extravagant party animal who makes everyone around him cheer up by his mere presence. Instead, it looks like a fucking funeral dirge. With the amount of money HBO has spent on this show, they couldn't out just a little bit more effort into costume design? 

* Did we really need that protracted sequence between Loras and Renly? And for that matter, did we really need Margaery Tyrell to not only look much older than she's supposed to be, but to be so blatant in her manipulative ways? It completely ruins any chance of shocking reveals in later episodes and seasons, and frankly simplifies Margaery's character entirely too much. 

* Balon Greyjoy actually pausing in a doorway as his whiny son bitches about being abandoned? Really? Are you fucking kidding me? Why add this needless soap opera melodrama when there is PLENTY of ACTUAL GOOD drama in the books themselves? Additionally, how weak of a baptism scene was that? I know that in the books we never see Theon  get anything but the cursory blessing from Aeron, but can you imagine how fucking awesome it would have been to watch Theon burn that letter and then LITERALLY get reborn as a Greyjoy? But nope, didn't happen. 

* Shae is ALREADY Sansa's handmaiden? That is jumping the gun so damn much I could barely help myself from loudly scoffing at that entire, useless scene. Not too mention the TERRIBLE accents that kept on slipping in and out during most scene's involving anyone at King's Landing. I even managed to dislike Peter Dinklage in this episode, as Tyrion has gone from a complex character to a rather one trick pony in the series. 

* Speaking of complex characters, Thank you , Yara, for completely ruining one of the funner characters in the books and effectively making her into an ugly, uncharismatic annoyance that might as well just be written out of the series all together (much like, oh, I dunno, Meera, Jojen, Patchface, Shireen...) Concerning characters cut out from the show, thanks for having the grand finale of Yoren charging out to meet some fucking ""honorable death"" like a goddamn fool end with an utterly non-descript bald-headed man skewering who I assume to be Lommy at the end of the episode. 

This episode just cemented in my mind that HBO, as a network, has given up on the idea of providing any fan service whatsoever (And please, don't try to tell me Yoren's little story and foreshadowing of Arya's eventual prayer fit the bill. It was pedantic and utterly patronizing at best.) If AMC can put such an *incredible* amount of thought and effort and design and purpose into the most *mundane* parts of Mad Men (sets, clothing, music), and they can do it with a completely *new* story, then why the hell can't HBO even *try* to match them? I mean, between Sam's North Face jacket, YARA fucking Greyjoy, and Ros having more than just a fucking cameo, Hbo has managed to turn Game of Thrones into the one thing I prayed it would never become.

I need your help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/shjz4/hey_rgameofthrones_i_need_your_help/,TheHistorianMan,1334823524,"Straight to the point: I lead a P&amp;P-RPG-group which settles in the world of SOFAI. We use (don't assume you know it, but hey!) the DSA (Das schwarze Auge/The black Eye) 4.1 -Rulesystem. After lot's of good evenings with my group I kind of running out with idea's for further adventures. So my question is: Could someone in this sub give away any good idea for a 1) campain main-theme or 2)a small (ca 40 hours gameplay) adventure?




To give you further information:


-The story settles 200 years before the events of ""Game of thrones"".
under the reign of King Baleor (the on that builded the cathedral).


-The party consists of: A Maester (King's Landing), A Warrior (noble) from the North, a dornish Soldier (deserter) and a ""thief""/""spy"" (Westerlands/Lennisport). 


-The party has a lair in the Rainwoods, Stormlands.


-The party has contact with the Hand of the King, Viserys II.





Some limitations for (hopefully) upcoming ideas: 


-The story should NOT have something to do with the upcoming Blackfyre-rebellion.


-The story may NOT be too epic: No dragon-slaying in Valyria, no really important character from the books/history of westeros involved in a way he/she could die/act different from what GRR M. wrote. 


-NO MAGIC. The reason we choosed Westeros was that there were no dwarfs, elfs, trolls, orcs, unicorns and other pulp. A rare use of ""monsters"" like Direwolves, shadowcats and beasts alike is cool. But no dragons. There are no dragons. Not anymore. 


Thanks, thats all. I hope this won't get downvoted to Oblivion since I would love to here your thoughts and ideas, you scullawaggy-somewhat-creative folk, you!


TL;DR: Need ideas for P&amp;P-adventures in Westeros.

So, I am going to try and edit season 1 and make a clean version of GOT for my mom and 11 year old brother (no boobs for him! hah). 

Basically, I'm just looking for any tips or advice on doing this. 

Anyone got an extensive list of all the nudity/sex scenes in Season 1? Send them my way.

Any ideas how to not lose valuable details when editing out entire scenes for sexual content?

**Please don't down vote this just because you disagree with me editing the show. I'm looking for any helpful tips/advice in creating a clean version. I'm not asking you to watch it.**    

*edit: I plan to edit the nudity/sex out of the show so my brother, mom and dad can watch it without offending my mom. I didn't post this so much to get peoples opinions on whether or not I *should* edit it because I plan to do it regardless of popular opinion. I posted this for tips and advice on *how* to do it. So if you have an tips on how I should go about doing that please share..**If you want to share your opinion on why I shouldn't do it feel free but you're wasting your time..I am already aware that it is not the most ideal way to watch the show.**",9,0,False,default,,,,,

Slynt says that Ned Stark tried to buy his loyalty.  In s1e7 when ned is talking to Littlefinger, he basically asks Littlefinger to bribe the city watch for him.  So is this implying that Littlefinger did infact try to side with Ned at first but went with the Lannisters only because it was the only way he could end up on top?  

When I first watched the series/read the books it was my understanding that Littlefinger had no intention of siding with Ned, so this is throwing me for a bit of a loop.

Tywin Lannister doesn't want Tyrion to inherit Casterly Rock after he is dead. Yet, the day Jamie is appointed to the Kingsguard,  in which a member is not allowed to hold lands, sire children, marry, or have any worldly allegiance except to his monarch, it doesn't occur to Tywin that it would be passed on to Tyrion? Even if it did occur to him, if he hated Tyrion as much as he says, wouldn't it have been in his best interests to remarry and have another son? Robert ruled the Seven Kingdoms for 15 years after over throwing the Mad King Aerys so there was plenty of time to attempt to have another male son. With another heir to Casterly Rock, Tywin could just banish Tyrion to the Night's Watch or just have him killed (although I don't think Tywin would do this) and there would be a new heir which he could groom himself into what he wanted like with the rest of his children.

I now understand that the only high-fantasy novels/works I've ever experienced have been absolutely shit in and of themselves.

Game of Thrones is the BEST FUCKING SHOW ON TELEVISION RIGHT NOW (my opinion will, however, change when Doctor Who comes back. Sorry :D). 

BUT SERIOUSLY, what an amazing show. I know I'm just preachin' to the choir, but wow I am totally blown away by this series. It's really intense, really incredible just amazing really. I'm more blown away by the fact that this is something I would normally never love. If you ever met me, you would think I was the last person to like Game of Thrones.

YET HERE I AM, AND IMMA START READING THE BOOKS AND EVERYTHING. WOO!

sorry if this is not an appropriate post for this subreddit, I had to share though! :-)

Also I really hope Robb or Aria or Tyrian or Genry or Jon don't die.

All I've had spoiled for me is that shit hits the fan during one of the weddings in the book, and I'm not liking some of the dialogue from Lord Walder Frey. If this is indeed the Red Wedding I'm coming up on, I thought some people might enjoy a before/after from a first time reader, and I'm actually kinda nervous right now and needed to take a break from the book. While it won't be quite as good as something from someone who had no clue about RW at all, hopefully it will have some merit. Also, I'm really hoping I'm wrong about what I'm about to read, and that the Red Wedding refers to Joffrey getting fed to the dancing bear at his wedding instead.

I'm going to post about the Catelyn chapter I just read, then read and post about the Arya chapter, and finally read and post about the next Catelyn chapter. If it turns out that this is not the Red Wedding, I'll come back and update when I figure out what that is. Finally, I won't be reading any comments until I finish the book, so feel free to post about all of SoS. While this will probably require me to go a few days without reddit, I really don't want anything else in this book to be spoiled.

**Before:**
 
Thoughts on Catelyn VI:

* Why doesn't anyone ever listen to the wolf?

* ""The red will flow"" not liking this, not one bit...

* What's up with the food? Is Frey just going to say ""Fuck it!"" and kill people anyways, or did he pull some trick like not salting the food or replacing the wine with sparkling grape juice?

Something about this chapter just seems off. I had a bit of a forewarning, so I'm definitely catching things I would have missed otherwise, but Frey is seriously giving me the creeps right now. I can't figure out what he's doing, but he's definitely playing them. Why'd he give Edmure such a pretty wife? This is giving me a bit of hope that everyone's going to make it out of this, but I don't know... Also I don't like the fact that Bolton is here. Seriously, fuck that guy.

Thoughts on Arya X:
Not much to say, other than I hope Clegane gets to wreck some face next chapter. Also, just thought that Frey may have wanted Jeyne there to kill her...

**After:**
....Be back in a bit, need to take a walk. If Arya/Hound don't rampage through the streets I swear I'm done with this fucking book....

That was terrible, I barely made it through the last couple paragraphs...I'm going to have to go back and reread them...but not right now. 

Shit, I got so hopeful there for a while. All that delicious food had me convinced that I had made a fool out of myself on the internet. If only. I knew it was going to be bad, but I thought *someone* was going to live through it. And the way Catelyn went out... I need to read the next chapter now, or I might not ever finish this book. 

I don't think I've ever read something that affected me so much. I watched the first season before reading the books, and Ned's death wasn't nearly as bad. He was a warrior, he knew he fucked, and his only regret before dying may have been proclaiming himself a traitor, but he at least went out thinking he just saved his daughter. Catelyn died thinking all of her children were dead, or soon to be dead. She killed an innocent retard out of anger. It was so unnecessary. And her breakdown at the end there...god. 

I really thought that Robb had pulled some trickery and named her his heir instead of Jon. I could have lived with that. 

These books were supposed to be about the Starks! Even though there's still a bunch of them left, the only one who still seems really Starkish is Jon, and he's got other things to worry about.

I'm off the read the next chapter, I'll add a few more thoughts here then it's bedtime. 

Arya:
What the fuck just happened! That's it, I'm done. I know she's not dead, but really, was that necessary. Fuck George R.R. Martin and his stupid books. That damn bear better eat Joffrey.",59,61,False,self,,,,,

I think more likely the show runners will have a rough outline of everything that's going to happen and create a somewhat different season/ending so that it's not ruined entirely for the readers. Kind of like what happened with the Scott Pilgrim movie. 

Maybe they can slow the pace of the show and cut the books into two separate seasons? 

Personally my favorite idea is to have a flashback season, showing everything that happened in Robert's Rebellion. I mean there is plenty of fodder to flesh out a whole season with the backstory and it would be a great way to get some of the answers you get in the later books.

I have a few questions about the history of some characters and exactly *who* some characters actually are. If some of my questions are answered in future seasons, and are not large plot points or twists, then I don't mind if you use that information. If they are things I shouldn't know yet, then let me find out that way.

* Who is Renly Baratheon? ~~In Season 1 he was in Kings Landing on the council, but now in Season 2 he's king of a different house?~~
Edit: Found out he's King in Highgarden. Why wasn't he King in Season 1? 

* ~~What happened to Eddard Stark's father and brother? In Season 1 Jaime Lannister mentioned something about him and 500 others watching them die? Why were they killed?~~ **Edit:** Found this on the wiki: ""Lyanna (Eddard Stark's sister) was apparently kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen. Brandon Stark, upon hearing this, rode straight to King's Landing, and upon entering the keep he roared for Rhaegar ""to come out and die."" King Aerys had Brandon and his companions arrested. Shortly after his father, Rickard Stark, was summoned to the city to answer for the crimes of his son. He was immediately arrested himself and shortly after brutally killed with his son. This was a primary impetus for Robert's Rebellion.""

* What happened to Eddard Stark's sister? How/Why did she die?

* Why was Jon Snow's uncle at the Wall in Season 1? I'm assuming he signed up to be there, like Jon Snow?

* I'm pretty sure when they talk about my above question, they mentioned Targaryens - who were the Targaryens and where did they rule? Why were they exiled? Why were there only 2 (now 1) left? What is their link to the dragons, and why is Daenerys Targaryen the only one with dragon powers? (Not sure if this question could only be answered with spoilers, so if that's the case ignore this question)

* Who is Melisandre? ~~What was the city she was in where they first show her in Season 2~~? (Where that old guy tries to poison her). What is the significance of that city and it's leaders?

* Where are the Lannisters originally from? Kings Landing? 

* Why doesn't Cersei Lannister's father rule Kings Landing? Why is *he* off at War, and not ruling as King? Or is he King of somewhere else and Geoffry is just king of Kings Landing?

* What happened between the Greyjoy's and the Stark's? 

* Who was Yoren and why was he protecting Arya Stark? 

* In the Game of Thrones universe, do they ever show if God's actually exist? Or do the characters just pray to their God's and that's it?

* Who ""owns"" the Wall? Kings Landing? 

* They say in Season 1 that summer lasted 9 years, and that ""Winter is Coming"" and that it will last a long time. Do they explain why seasons are sporadic like that?

That's it for now. Sorry for all of the questions! I hope it wasn't too much. 


**Edit:** [Found this](http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/) (which I should have looked for before coming here, sorry!). This helped a lot as well.

The fact that Littlefinger seems to have a pretty tight grip on that brothel is the one thing that makes it unclear...

I don't mind the little changes or even moderate ones so far, but this episode really seemed to go into the wild blue yonder on some plot points.

The Volantis womand and Rob (Jeyne?) was created. The scene with the whores (more Ros) and Jof was both cringe-inducing and created. 

I really almost ran to my copy of ACoK because it feels like the book events that *did* happen are happening in the wrong sequences (some things are coming earlier).

I really thought there would be about 3-5 more minutes at the end of the episode, too.

I know my wife (she's only read the first book and just barely started the next) couldn't make heads or tails of some of the events without book knowledge.

After the Dothraki marriage scene, Khal Drogo makes love to Daenerys. From what I recall in the books, he tried to be romantic despite not knowing how (that has a lot to do with him being, well, a savage). Not surprisngly, as a result their marriage was a relatively happy one.

I mean come on these are major things you're changing. And each time we hear a new change it's always to help the viewers not get lost in the names and such. Here's a thought HBO people have been reading the series for years and haven't been hindered by these things. I'm pretty sure we're all grown ups who can keep names straight and deal with family disputes (being that that's what the whole series is about mainly).

They don't ""add to the story"". This complaints are silly.

First of all, in each of the scenes like this, there is dialogue that reveals something about the character or the plot. With Theon it is usually his insecurity and feeling out of place. In the infamous ""play with her ass"" scene, it's Littlefinger's deconstruction of his society and in turn the writers deconstruction of his psyche. Joffrey's scene in the latest episode...I just don't see how people believe this is over the top given, oh I don't know, everything else he has done? The list goes on.

Especially when I hear this from people who have read the books. No some of the sex scenes are not in the book, but then again neither are many of the scenes.  I don't see why the sex is getting special attention as being ""pointless"". Also there is tons of sex in the books. I'm pretty sure half of Tyrion's scenes feature him blowing a load into Shae. And Joffrey is worse in the books than in the show in my opinion. He is just getting started based on tonight's episode. The fact that he is such a scumbag is important for the show's drama as he is the only unrelenting psychopath as opposed to the more human other villains, and if you've read the books you should really know how important that becomes.

This is that classic thing where as soon as people see tits, they turn their brain off. They assume that the creators put it in to give people boners or increase ratings.

MY ""PROOF"":

She is listed as being a ""King's Mistress.""  I'm guessing she was either the whipper or the whippee in the ""Joffrey is really evil"" scene with the hookers.

I can't really think of any other King's mistressess that she might have been.  Renly has Marjorie, Stannis has Melisandre, and Robb looks to have just met his girl. 

Additionally, I might be crazy, but a few of the shots of Joffrey in that scene looked a little odd, like they didn't match.  Reshoots maybe?

In the beginning, Valyria was akin to Rome and the Targaryens and their dragons came from there to conquer Britain. They even had Queen Alysanne who resembles Hadrian, even though the wall was already built in GRRM's adaptation of history, she bestows the New Gift to add strength to the Wall. also the wall serves the same purpose as Hadrian's wall, to keep out the Picts (wildlings). Aerys the Mad King [ASOS spoiler](/b ""is an anachronous version of King Nero, he has the same plan to burn the city and god complex""). Now the other factions are based on real civilizations: the current men of westeros are the Germanic Anglo-Saxons, the First Men were the Britons, the iron men are the Vikings, the Dothraki are the Huns and even sacked Rome (Valyria), the Ghiscari are Egyptians with pyramids and slaves. This clearly sets up the period of the unification of Britain but GRRM clearly does not mean to stick to plain history (because dragons. and Others and...) so whatever happens is clearly up to him now.

I have read the first book only and my girlfriend has read none of them.  We borrowed season 1 from a co-worker and as we watched, my girlfriend asked some poignant questions I had not considered.

How do they not have an accurate idea of when winters come and go and how long the seasons will be?

That led to the larger question of, what kind of planet are they on via-a-vis what kind of solar system are they in?  Does the planet have an irregular orbit around how many or what kind of celestial bodies?

We were really puzzled by this.",9,5,False,self,,,,,

In a ACOK when Arya is witnessing the torture, one of the questions that keeps coming up is ""Where is Lord Beric Dondarrion?"" I had pretty much forgotten about the guy since Ned sent him off, and was a little confused about about how very interested the Lannister men were in finding the guy.  Shouldn't the Mountain be more concerned about Robb Stark?  Turns out no.  Watch out for Beric Dondarrion.

I'm sure fans of the Brotherhood Without Banners were pleased to hear the group mentioned, but the most interesting part of the Brotherhood to me was alway Dondarrion(no offense to Lem Lemoncoat), specifically the way we readers slowly hear his legend grow and grow long before any of our characters meet up with him again. That slow burn was the best.

To really nitpick I feel like the war is still new enough that people in the brotherhood wouldn't have given themselves that name yet, as they may not yet be aware of how long the fighting is going to go on, or that this will become a way of life for them.  They're still just trying to kill the Mountain and protect some small folk.

Okay, thats it. I'm sure we're gonna get a Beric name drop sooner rather than later, but I had always really enjoyed that the first hint we get that somethings going with that guy is that the Mountain is concerned enough about him include it in his torture questions.",13,11,False,self,,,,,

Just wanted to see what reddit's preferences are. If this gets big enough I'll tally them up. It can be a house motto (""Winter is Coming"") or a general saying (""Words are wind""). Readers will likely have more to work with. Here are a few. The flair page is also a great resource.

Major house sayings:
Winter is coming - Stark,
Hear me roar - Lannister,
Ours is the fury - Baratheon,
Fire and blood - Targaryen,
We do not sow - Greyjoy,
Growing Strong - Tyrell,
As high as honor - Arryn,
Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken - Martell,
Family, Duty, Honor - Tully,

Others:
A Lannister always pays his debts,
Words are wind,
The night is dark and full of terrors,
What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger,
It is known,
Fear cuts deeper than swords,
You know nothing, Jon Snow,
Hodor,
Valar Morghulis/Dohaeris

Plenty more but these are the major ones I can think of off the top of my head. Feel free to also add a why to your response.

So, I tried to read ACoK simultaneously with Season 2. It was interesting to watch scenes I had just read and vice versa. Ultimately, however, I ended up finishing ACoK because I wasn't gonna stop and wait for the series to catch up. It is nice to have the book plot fresh in my mind as I watch the adaptation, though.

To start with, i would like to look at the religions. For me, it seams like there are two kind of religions. The ones there is like the religion in our world, created by men to give some rationality to the world (the 7 &amp; drowngod). 

And then the other type, these seam to be grounded/founded in the in the nature/elements around men: Firegod - fire, Old gods - earth, Drowngod - water, whatever Craster has as god - ice. Each is carratized by the nature of the elements. The old gods, grow and create places the living and the spirit can merge into one. The fire-god transfers energy. Were the Ice-god consume everything it touches. 

This just leaves all the magic in the east.
Bloodmagic: it seams like an extension of the knowledge of the fire-god. You transfer energy from one place to another.
 
 

Based on this, we can explain these guys in a rational mannor; 

Dragons: Are of cause creatures of fire. For me they are the ones there make least sense. They are creatures of fire, they need the energy of a King to be born, need the spirit of Daenerys to be created (since she also is a creature fire)
Shadowthing: Based , it comsumed something to create something. It used the energy of a unborn king, to kill a king. 
Greenseer: by gaining this gift, one can channel everything created by the earth. (belive that even dragons can be channeled, since they need spirit to be created) 
White Walkers: they to need the spirit to create life, in form of the babyes there then is cunsumed. 

This also make sense with the title. Earth grow stuff, while fire and Ice fight to consume it (for their own power). That can also be taken into another perspective, were the people build stuff, and some fight over it. 

Is this just me, or does this make sense?

I then read AGoT after the first season, and this is how I'll continue; watch the season then read the book. Both are fantastic in my point of view.
 After Garden of Bones I felt a little confused, and the tiniest bit irritated. I don't read heavy fantasy, because I just can't stand the amount of goblins and orcs and farks and shnotkins and elves and pixies and puttyprancerbittyboks. I've got nothing against that, but it's just not for me. Which is why I'm so obsessed with Martin's story; it's character politics are central to the narrative. And combined with the diverse world these characters inhabit, it's a brilliant construct. I always suspected magic might become a more major player as the story continued, but it would be subtle. After watching [TV spoiler] (/s ""Davos experience - in full view - some sort of smoke monster being birthed from Melisandre""), I'm a little concerned. 
I trust Martin's writing skill and his ability to craft a story, so I'm not really that worried. But what I want to know is, does Martin handle the introduction of magic tastefully and subtly as the series progresses?

House Stark

Welp, apparently I was wrong.I parked the book and read some other thingies.Now I wanna go back to the series and I don't know how to act. I've read the AFFC plot summary on wikipedia (...Yeah, I know..) and my options are now:

1-Read the whole series again.This would refresh my memory, but I'm very lazy and probably wouldn't make it through all the books again.

2-Attempt to read AFFC once more.This would  probably be the best option, as I don't really feel ""ready"" for ADWD, having only read a plot summary from the previous book.

But since I already know the important stuff that happened in it and I don't really like the character choice for AFFC, I don't find it very attractive.

3-GIVE UP AND GO READ SUM HARRY POTTER AND HUNGER GAMES.


Yes, I know this is a silly post and a silly problem, but I honestly don't know what to do.The series are awesome and I don't want to miss the whole thing because of a single book.

tl;dr: It's possible to fail at reading.If you are me. =(

I haven't read the books, so please stay clear of any book references that may be anything close to spoilers for us TV-folk.

In season 1, Tywin Lannister gave half of his army (30,000 men) to Jaime. Robb Stark then defeated Jaime's army. In 'Garden of Bones' [S2Ep4], Robb surprise attacks another Lannister army. 

* Which Lannister army did Robb attack in 'Garden of Bones'?

* What happened to Jaime's army when Jaime was captured? I assumed they retreated/fled - if so, what happened to the survivors?

* What's the status of Tywin's army?

Thanks everyone!

I figure that Tyrion being disfigured at the end of the last book would be okay to skip since such major make up for a major character would be ridiculously time consuming, but for Lord Beric, it seems like his disfigurements are part of the character himself since he has been revived so many times as a result of them. 

So, am I looking too far ahead or has there been any mention. I ask because he seems to play a big role in Arya's story in Storm of Swords and it would be a shame if they replaced him with a generic look as it wouldnt really be the same character. ",14,8,False,self,,,,,

-they say that his braided hair was never cut because he never lost a fight. maybe since he never got hurt in his life his immune system was too weak to handle a single wound.

-the witch lady that was supposed to be healing him actually poisoned him because she was still mad at him raping and killing and stuff

-his love for Dany weakened him so he was no longer the toughest dude ever

He's no better of a person than she is.  He killed the king who he swore an oath to protect, and what's worse is that he and the Lannister's only joined the war on Robert's side when they were sure Robert would win.  He also tried to kill Bran, which I'm sure Cersei would have done as well.

Basically he's a coward and has very little honor.

On Cersei's behalf, I see some compassion within her.  She did try to save Ned Stark from being beheaded and I sense that she has some empathy for Sansa.

A lot of people like it of course, but I was skeptical. I started watching it not too long ago and I liked it.

The creators made it very easy for us to fall in love with the Starks and hate the Lannisters.

King Robert died and his final wish was for Eddard to become protector of the realm until Joffrey was of age. OK. Sounds like a plan. Then Joffrey assumes the role with the help of his mother. This made me mad, of course. But, I didn't worry for long! Eddard's wife's friend (I forget his name) pledged to help him take the throne. Success! But then he was betrayed, thrown into a dungeon and killed.

I started watching this show because of Sean Bean, but now that he's gone, I don't know if it's worth watching anymore. I absolutely loathe the Lannister House, with the exception of Tyrion. He's awesome.

So if the show is becoming more and more focused on them, I don't think I will enjoy it anymore and I certainly don't want to waste time watching a show that I'm hating more and more each episode.

So with that in mind, does it stray from that and ""get better""?

**EDIT**: Thanks for the info guys. I get that this subreddit wouldn't still be active if it wasn't worth it. I basically needed to know if there was someone I could still root for. With Eddard gone, I wasn't sure if there would be since he was the main one I was rooting for. But as people have mentioned, the Lannisters won't get as much limelight, I'll see more of Tyrion, I should keep an eye out for Davos and others.

Thanks again!",55,8,True,nsfw,,,,,

After I'm done with the season, I'll read the book to flesh out all the interesting details. I definitely enjoyed having a visual frame of reference from the show while reading the first book, and imagining how the actors would have portrayed the scenes not in the show is really cool.

Now unless Raeghar held a secret wedding to make Lyanna his 2nd wife (which isn't impossible, but there's no evidence that he did) that would mean Jon's still a bastard because he was born out of wedlock.

So this gets me wondering, is a bastard's name derived from the region where the father comes from, the region of the mother, or the region where the child grows up? In other words, would the revelation that Jon is Raeghar's son change his bastardly last name?

(TV speculation/spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/sz78u/what_are_balons_motivations_here_tv/,elchip,1335756983,"I haven't read the books (yet) and don't want anything major spoiled for me.  So if it's impossible to answer my question without spoiling later events in the books... please don't answer my question.

Anyway, it seems to me that Balon's motivations in the TV show haven't been well-articulated.  Frankly, they make him come off as completely nuts.

I know he rebelled ~8 years ago for independence for the Iron Islands, and failed miserably.

So he's bitter against the Starks for ... what, exactly?  Because *Robert* rallied the other kingdoms against his rebellion and forced him to give up his son as a ward to Ned?

So Theon comes to him with Robb's proposal to give independence to the Iron Islands, and his reply is to raid and rape the North?  What does he aim to accomplish?

He doesn't seem to be capable of actually taking on any of the other major houses in a fair fight, so it would appear that one of a couple scenarios would likely happen:

1) Robb gets wind of what's going on, and crushes him after much damage is done to the North.  Balon, Theon, and Yara/Asha get executed for their treachery.

2) Robb gets wind of what's going on, but in the chaos gets caught between the Greyjoy and Lannister forces and is crushed.  The Lannisters, being Lannisters, refuse to honor the Greyjoy's desire for independence.  At best, they give him dominion over a very unhappy North (but still subservience to King's Landing) for his service in getting rid of Robb.

I know that things often don't go as expected in Westeros, and I'm guessing that neither #1 or #2 **actually** end up happening.  [ASOS Spoiler](/b ""I've run afoul of some spoilers involving a so-called Red Wedding, for instance; I'm not 100% sure how it factors into the grand scheme of things, but I think it involves things not turning out in an expected manner."")  But they seem like the most likely outcomes.

And Balon must know this, unless he's insane.

So.  What's his goal here?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

Qarth is bloody beautiful. They nailed the sets, they nailed the costumes, they nailed the makeup, and for some reason couldn't get the direction right. Pyat Pree was really creepy until he started talking like everybody else. Xaro and Quaithe were the same way.

In case it seems like I'm complaining about a small thing here, let me be reiterate that everything about Qarth screams ""Dany is in a different place from everybody else."" They do this so that we can orient where she is in the narrative without hearing even a line of dialogue. This show actually does this incredibly well or it would be more confusing than it already is.

Game of Thrones is pretty good at not half-assing things, so it really sticks out badly when they didn't bother to tell the Qartheen actors ""do anything but act European."" Especially Pyat Pree, who is perfect, but gave a boring delivery.",0,0,False,self,,,,,
