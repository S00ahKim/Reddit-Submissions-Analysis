Fight every battle everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend. Every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that youve seen before.

Is it possible that what Little finger is describing is actually green sight?

Is the reason he smiles as she walks away because he got in her head, or because he knew Bran was about to make his astonishing homecoming?

The ability to envision every foreseeable outcome and every series of events all at once sounds a lot like green sight.

Could this explain how such a spineless man could have the audacity and courage to incite the War of the Five Kings?

We've seen a man with no land, no wealth, and no armies somehow came into all of them. If it's true, then how can we be sure he is truly dead? He wouldn't be the first person to return from the dead.

Why is HBO making the last two seasons so short if they are just going to rush the story?  The only reason I can think of to shorten the seasons is if theyve no more story to tell but that clearly isnt the case.  They couldve planned a remotely feasible way for the Night King to acquire a dragon if they didnt try to do it all within one episode which ended being absolute garbage.

It seems like all of the missteps that were made was due to being too constrained by screen time and not having enough time to plant seeds, develop the plot and let it breathe a bit.  I think even the most amateurish writers couldve figured out ways to fill up the gaps and despite some of the terrible choices the writers have made I know that they are at least talented enough to pull that off. 

I cant think of any single reason to shorten the seasons and I think GOT has only suffered for it. 100% mistake with zero benefit.",72,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now there were a lot of problems i had with that storyline and while I can think of many ways for it to be fixed I think there is one way they could've fixed it, tell the plotline from both sisters perspectives.

In the plotline we got we only really got the plotline from one of sisters, that sister being sansa and not only did it alienated Arya fans and made them feel like the showrunners only cared about Sansa these days but also it may arya look like she was acting WAY out of line, even out of character in some parts.

And yes I do think she was testing sansa and maybe that is what the showrunners were trying to go for, from the commentary it may it seem like it was meant to be rewatched a second time around to understand rhe subtle clues or maybe you were always suppose to suspect that arya was testing sansa and there was no real reason to give it a full reveal. But to be honest would you really notice either way? Because first of all the average viewer shouldn't have to watch it a second time around to see the subtle clues and secondly they removed the deleted scene with bran where this would get revealed along with them making up so there no point in keeping it subtle or having it be the case if your going to delete a very important scene (unless they reveal it next season).

So believe they should've had the plotline told from both arya and sansa's perspective. You can still have the scenes with Sansa in the story we got but also have some scenes with arya, maybe have some scenes where she does some more FM style sleuthing, maybe have a scene where she talks to bran or herself about what she's been through and how she fears sansa may have forgotten she is a stark and may be going astray, and if she is testing Sansa maybe even explain to bran that it is the only way she can know if sansa is telling the truth or not. Also maybe have some scene where she's bonding with  lyanna mormont and maybe those two guards (and not just make it seem like arya is straight up anti-social). So that way when Arya and Sansa to get into conflict Arya doesn't just look like a psycho but instead you would understand from both characters why they are acting the they are acting and your opinions on which one you agree with can change through out.

Now this wouldnt fix the plotline entirely for example you would still need the scene where bran tells sansa of LF betrayal on Ned. But either way I think telling the storyline from both sisters perspectives may have improved the season.",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Rewatching the show a few times it got my attention that in season 1 they made several little comments foreshadowing Jaime's ending game as Hand of the King.


* **S1E1** in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea.


* **S1E1** When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. ""The Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people""

That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.

* **S1E2** Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon's decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.

* **S1E3** When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King ""how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?

Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.


* **S1E5** - in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

* **S1E5** Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked. I think the show was giving us some hints about the end right in season 1.

* **S1E7** - Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.

______________

**BOOK FORESHADOW**

And I would like to add that in the books it is not a pin, but a chain of hands that signifies the office of the hand.And the mummers make a rope and hang Jaimes hand around his neck like a chain.

&gt;Boltons silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoats slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told. Jaime misliked those eyes. They reminded him of the day at Kings Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne. The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed his lips and said, **You have lost a hand.**             
     
&gt;**""No**, said Jaime, **I have it here, hanging round my neck.**

&gt;Ned, **he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys**, but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Roberts throne

Jaime Lannister, unlike his younger brother, is humble man, he pays attention to his mistakes and tries to learn from it and not repeat them.  He will be an ambassador, a peacemaker, the new Hand of the King. Jon Snow has no experience in the south; he doesnt know the Houses or the High Lords, but Jaime Lannister lived his whole life in Kings Landing, he watched his father his whole life.

I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains. A sentence used too many times to describe my status in this world. As far as I can remember I was told that I was meant to rule Westeros, to be Queen over the land due to my Targaryen blood, the blood of the Dragon Kings. I couldnt have been more wrong. 

I looked out the window, where the sea churned and the storm raged. It was brutally cold, to the point where the fire in the fireplace was struggling to stay strong, to stay warm, to stay vibrant. I smirked at the irony, due to the fact that the fire was me in a way. Slowly dying inside. My dragons have been uneasy lately. I could see, beyond the mist, Drogon and Rhaegal in flight, playing with each other, while also trying to find food, flames flying through the night sky. I suddenly got dizzy and quickly sat on the chair close to the fire. 7 months pregnant, and every moment of the pregnancy has been painful and nerve wracking. I havent even been able to fly my dragons into battle because of my immobility. 

Your Grace, may I come in. I would like to ponder some words with you. said Tyrion

Come in Tyrion. I'm tired of being on this dreadful island while everyone else is at war. Where are the Queens Guard? said Daenerys

Theyre positioned at the gates Your Grace. They will stay there until the war is finished. If, God forbid, the Night King lands on Dragonstone, your dragons will be the last line of defence. said Tyrion 

I was born on this island. Not that I remember it of course. I was too young. I had to flee alongside my brother to another land to escape the usurper Robert and his assassins after they took my families throne. Now another usurper sits on the throne, your sister, his wife Cersei Lannister. I am in a bad position but I assure you, if the Night King comes I will lay fire down on him like never before. I will not flee. I will not run. I promise you that. said Daenerys

Dragonstone Island was once the most irrelevant, miniscule place in the realm, just an island with no produce, and fewer people. But then your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror and his two sisters Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen, alongside their three dragons conquered seven kingdoms and millions of subjects in a few months, acceded the Iron Throne, and his ancestors, the Dragon Kings ruled for hundreds of years. Now youre in the same situation, now youre back at that island, back in the same castle with no Iron Throne to sit on, and a Kingdom you say is yours by right of succession. Youre a conqueror Daenerys, and you will rule, but we must be patient and wait for this threat to be extinguished. Tyrion said

I will not wait, I will not ponder. I am Daenerys Targaryen of the Old Blood of Valyria. I am the dragon. I will not rest until I leave this forsaken island with my dragons and kill the Night King. There is nothing but cold and sorrow on this island, and even more in this castle. My lover, Jon Snow, is off fighting a battle, alongside his siblings, and his subjects. The rest of the kingdom is in motion to stop the dead who march on my Kingdom. yelled Daenerys

I would like to remind you that you once had three dragons. Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. As your hand and advisor I warned you not to fly beyond the wall to protect Jon Snow from the Night King. You did not take my advice. You left with three dragons, and arrived with two. We must be smart. You are in full labor. You are Azor Ahai, You are the chosen one to rid us off the evil that marches on your Kingdom, but all good things come in good time.

As Tyrion was talking a loud shriek came from outside the balcony of the Chamber of the Painted Table. The dragons were uneasy just as their mother was. It was brutally cold and the seas were rising. The storms smashing up against Dragonstone Castle. At that moment Varys the Spider, one of Queen Daenerys advisors and spies came in.

Your Grace. We have just received word from Jon Snow, the King in the North. His little brother, Brandon Stark has a solution that involves you and has seen that you are to save us from the threat marching on the kingdom. The details I do not know but Jon Snow has asked you and your garrison northeast, to The Vale to have an audience with him. He is your husband, your grace, and your protection, as well as the babies is paramount, and so has asked you to travel by land to protect yourself and the baby. Varys said

Daenerys sat at the head chair, and looked over the painted table, which was in the shape of Westeros. She ran her fingers along the table and thought and pondered on their circumstance.

Why The Vale. Last time I heard from him he was in his castle at WInterfell, ruling over the North. What happened? Daenerys asked

Your grace. The Night King and the dead have overrun the North and has dominion over it all. He will be marching into the Riverlands soon enough, which is why it would be dangerous to travel by boat. We must be cautious. Varys said 

Prepare my ships. Prepare my guards. They will stay here at Dragonstone in case of my return. You both will find me at The Vale Daenerys said.

Daenerys then walked out of the chamber, walked through the dragonglass halls, to the royal apartments and sat on the bench in the front of her bed. She looked into the flames of the fireplace and immediately knew what she needed to do.

Missandei come and help me

Missandei came in breathless with Varys and Tyrion behind her.

Im here your grace. How can I serve you? Missandei asked

Help me put my riding boots on, and braid my hair. I cant have it blowing in my face while I fly. Daenerys said

You cannot fly Your Grace. You are too far into your pregnancy and it could be a strain  on you and your baby. Tyrion said 

 I cant be worried about a strain. The baby will be fine. I have a duty to this kingdom. I have a duty to my people. I have a duty to the throne. Daenerys said

Daenerys got up and walked out of the royal apartments, past the Chamber of the Painted Table, through the throne room, and out the main doors. Her guards tried to follow her.

Gaomagon daor nyesha nyke Daenerys said *Do not approach me*

They stopped in their tracks and returned to their positions. 

Daenerys then walked down the steps and through the main gates. The wind swept her dress up and the rain smashed against her face but she kept walking, the next foot surer than the last. She walked through the beach of the island.

Drogon, Rhaegal, mzigon naejot issa. Naejot aha munyke Daenerys said *Come to me, come to your mother.*

Drogon and Rhaegal flew over the ocean and landed in front of their mother. Tyrion and Missandei ran on to the beach and hugged Daenerys. 

Stay safe Daenerys. You are our last hope. Tyrion said 

Youre my greatest friend. You are meant to rule this kingdom. I will see that day come. Missandei said

I love you both. Ill be back. Dont worry about me. I am the blood of Old Valyria. I am the Dragon. Daenerys said

Daenerys climbed onto Drogon and flew away, with Rhaegal following behind her. Daenerys pushed Drogon to break the through the clouds so she could not be seen and flew Drogon as fast as she could. The cold at that altitude was brutal, and the wind nearly blew her away but she kept steady. The Vale is a mountain region ruled by The Arryns, one that is very high up in the mountains and impregnable. *That's probably why Jon escaped there with his household* Daenerys thought. 

Drogon began to shriek, beckoning to his brother Rhaegal to descend as they neared the Vale. As Daenerys got low enough she saw more fires ablaze than ever before, and men scrambling to build up defenses and make weapons. Daenerys saw mothers and children trying hard to stay warm as the Nights Kings jurisdiction and influence grew stronger and stronger, marching closer and closer. Daenerys landed in the gardens of The Eyrie and briskly got off.

Guards came, spears up, surrounding Daenerys, moving in closer

Who are you and why are you here? the guard questioned

No need to be so crude. I am Daenerys of the House Targaryen. I am the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Your Lord, Jon Snow, is my husband, and I carry his child. Daenerys answered

The guards disarmed themselves and bent their knees. They then returned to their positions and lit more fires, hoping to stay warm. Daenerys walked into The Eyrie, and descended deep into the palace to find the throne room. When she reached the heavy Iron doors, she saw her husband at the end of the hallway, with his guards, military advisors, and his brother Brandon, his two sister Arya and Sansa, and his close friends, Samwell Tarly, Tormund Giantsbane, Ser Jorah, Ser Davos, and as she began to walk down the steps the room got dark and the floor began to spun and

Dany, Dany please wake up 

As Daenerys began to stir, she saw Jon sitting at the end of the bed, and the Maester making a potion at the corner of the room. The room was incredibly hot, and it was clearly sunrise by the look of it. Dany got up and Jon ran to her. He hugged her and kissed her, cried on her, and began to laugh.

I missed you so much. Are you okay, do you feel alright? Jon asked 

Im alright my love. Just a bit sore and tired, Its been too long and I couldnt bear myself on that cold dreary island. I needed to see, and my dragons were restless, and I want to fight. I want to kill that monster, and the baby. Daenerys froze 

Where is my baby?

You mean our boy? Hes in the nursery. Everyone is with him. We made a beautiful baby Dany. You did it. Youre the strongest woman I know. Jon replied

How long has it been? Daenerys asked 

Only a fortnight, but the Night King is coming. You must return back to Dragonstone where you can be kept safe. He has taken the Riverlands and the North, and he knows that we lie here, in the safety of the mountain. He will be marching on us soon. Jon said

 He has only taken two of the seven kingdoms. I will not allow him to take any more. How do expect people to follow a Queen, who wont put her life at risk for them. I have given birth already. There is no need for safety any longer. I cannot go to King's Landing to sit on the throne due to the fact that Cersei of the House Lannister sits on the throne, and sleeps in my Royal Apartments within the Red Keep, while high walls, and millions of people defend her. We need a solution. Daenerys said

My brother has is a greenseer. The most powerful of all. He has the sight. He is the three eyed raven. He can see the past and the future, he can see all that happens here, and a thousand leagues away all while its happening, all at the same time. He says there is only one solution left and only you can hear it. Jon said 

Then call him for me. Lets see what this Brandon Stark has to say. Daenerys said

Jon left the room with the Maester. After ten minutes Brandon came into the room, spread across his wheelchair, his features askew.

Brandon, my dearest. How are you.? Daenerys asked

Theres no time for formalities. Im living, youre living, but something else marches on the realm. Something with a different form of magic. Something that relishes in destruction and decay. A being that takes away life, and brings death. That something is the Night King, that something is the White Walkers. That something is the hundreds of thousands of dead people that march behind him. But we have a solution. Brandon said 

What is that solution. I have two dragons at my disposal. I have a hundred thousand men who will kill at my command. Daenerys said 

If only that was the answer. I have looked into past and the future, I have looked into the flames. You are the answer. Jon Snow is not the answer. Your dragons and your men are not the answer. Yours is the song of ice and fire. You, Daenerys must be given to the Night King. It is the sacrifice that the realm needs. For eons the white walkers have taken humans to foster into the next Night King, yet always failing due to the constitution of the blood. The Night King now knows that you hold the constitution needed for the accession of a new King. He will not stop until he gets what he wants. This must be done. Brandon said 

Daenerys began to sob clinging at the bed sheets, holding the blankets as hard as she could. She stumbled off the bed and laid on the floor, trying to grasp some sort of foundation, some sort of stability. She laid there for close to an hour, Brandon patiently waiting.

Ever since I can remember, I was told of tales about my brother Rhaegar who I named my dragon after. The man who valiantly went to the crossroads and tried to fight off the usurper Robert Baratheon and failed with no avail. I was told that I am the last Targaryen, the one who needed to bring back the Royal House of Targaryen back to strength. Told that I must sit on the throne. Told that I must rule this kingdom. I see, now, my role in it all. I see my fate. I must do what is necessary. I must serve the realm. In the end I will become a Queen. Just not the kind that I always thought. Dont tell Jon. I must do it without him knowing. Only afterward shall they know my sacrifice. Take care of my child. Take care of Jon. Daenerys said 

You must hurry. Ride Drogon to the crossroads, and give yourself to him. He will take you to the Lands of Always Winter. The ritual will begin and you shall become the Night's King, forced by magic to hold your dominion where the Wall once stood. Frozen in ice for eons until the time comes again to find an heir. Then the cycle will begin again.. Brandon said

I am the Mother of Dragons. I am the azor Ahai. I am the blood of Old Valyria. My time has come. I shall bring a new dawn, and hold a new position. Goodbye my friend. Tell Jon to move on. To find a new purpose. To take my dragons and my child, fly south and take Kings Landing. He shall become King, and raise our child to do the same. A new age shall begin. Daenerys said

That I will do. Brandon said 

Valar Morghulis. All men must die. Valar Dohaeris. All men must serve. An ancient formality said to all in my mother tongue, High Valyrian. And so I must serve. And so I must die  

Daenerys got up, put on her coat, wrapped her hair up into a bun, and put her boots on. She put her arm in the fire. Feeling its warmth for the last time. She put on her crown and walked down the hall. Daenerys walked past the nursery, tears in her eyes, not able to say bye, while everyone laughed and cheered inside. Daenerys walked past the throne room and up the stairs. The next step surer than the last. She walked into the garden, the sun going down. She realized a day had come and gone. Just like her life had. But now it had more meaning than it ever did. She climbed Drogon who shrieked, beckoning to his mother. 

Sves said Daenerys *fly*

Dracarys commanded Daenerys *dragonfire*

Drogon breathed fire into the night sky, taking her back to the first few days she brought dragons into the world after hundreds of years of extinction. Daenerys flew fast, towards the crossroads, to meet her fate.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So, this is already stupid as shit because ***the coins are different fucking shapes***. But it gets worse.

He gives the coins to a whore and blindfolds her before having her blindly go to each man and give him a coin. ***Why the hell is SHE blindfolded? And why does SHE pick which coin to hand them?*** 

Not that letting them pick their own uniquely shaped coins would be much better, but it's just so many unnecessary steps that all boil down to one thing, ""let's have this prostitute pick which one of us does an assassination.""

It's by far the worst sexposition the show has ever done, it's not even sexposition really because there's no exposition, just a topless chick they agree to let rig a random drawing. AND this takes place in s3 when they still have plenty of GRRM material to adapt, but nope, they decide ***this scene*** is worth writing, casting, and spending a shitload of money shooting.

I've not tagged a spoiler post before, so I hope I've done it right (Mods please help me fix it if not)./***

Watching Arya cut open Baelish's throat and watching Sansa start to emerge as a force was incredibly satisfying. For about thirty seconds, after which I started to get annoyed. Baelish was a very clever man; clever enough to have killed a king and gotten away with it, and to have killed several other high-power figures and come away unscathed. It didn't feel right for him to be taken down in the way that he was.

For me, everything about the plot leading up to Baelish's death was messy. I get that they were gunning for a ""will they/won't they"" thing between Arya and Sansa, especially given that the sisters had a turbulent foundation upon which to build, but for me the execution was poor. Re-ordering the scenes could have made the sequence a lot more powerful. In my mind:

* The scene where Baelish tells Sansa about his Little Game (assuming the worst reasons for every action) should have come much sooner. If not at the end of S6 then immediately after Baelish sees the fight between Arya and Brienne. That for me is the moment that Baelish starts feeling uncertain; Sansa now has two trained warriors on her side who can easily outmatch him physically. He needs to secure his place at Sansa's side.

* Then there should have been the scenes with Baelish acquiring Sansa's letter and hiding it so that Arya could find it. 

* Then the confrontation of Arya and Sansa over the letter - which, as it was in the show, seemed jarring and out of place. We know Arya loves a bit of drama (Merryn Trant and the Freys have proved that) but her idea of drama is *doing* something, not just walking around monologue-ing about this one time she shot an arrow and she wasn't told off for it.

* After this, there should have been another scene with Sansa and Baelish: ""Remember my little game? What's the worst reason she could have for using this letter against you?"", guiding Sansa to the 'Lady of Winterfell' conclusion.

* Then the conversation in the bedroom about playing the Game of Faces. Arya's handing over of the knife should have been more significant - a silent nod to 'We're both being played, we both know who's behind it, I'll follow your lead' which I think was too understated in the episode. 

* Then the (shouldn't-have-been-cut) scene with Bran - even if it's just that we see Sansa going in to Bran's room but we don't hear the conversation. 

* Resolving in the scene where Arya's ""trial"" quickly turns on Peter (the only part of the arc that I did like. Honestly, I'm not sure if I prefer Arya's ""My sister asked you a question."" or Sansa's ""Which of the charges don't you understand?"")

People argued after the episode aired that Baelish was blinded by his love for Sansa, which I disagree with. He might love Sansa, but she is still a pawn to be played in the great game. If he loved her the same way he loved Catelyn he would have found a way for her to avoid Ramsey's cruelty (like a marriage and a murder, *a la* Joffrey). And I don't want to argue that he underestimated them because they're children; Arya's fight against Brienne was significant to Baelish, and Bran unnerved him with a simple sentence. 

I think the writers missed out on a great opportunity to really pay homage to Baelish's intellect. In the end he was taken down by a trio of unmatchable force: a trained assassin, aboy who knows everything, and a girl with whom he shared a lot of his wisdom. Bran knew what he had done before, Sansa could best predict what he might do next, and Arya was the best to sneak around and gather intel on what he was doing now. 

In the end it took supernatural assistance to bring him to heel - three minds gathering as much as they could in the past, present and future - and I think this was lost in an overly convoluted storyline.

No, its not the best possible or the only possible end for him - but its narratively and thematically consistent with the rest of the series.

**Books:** Brienne takes Jaime to LSH. After the shock of seeing her alive, you spend some guilt-ridden time as Jaime reflects on his crimes. He's then either killed via execution or in an escape attempt.

**Show:** Jaime doesn't get the welcome he expects in the North - everyone still hates him and his family, especially for Cersei's latest betrayal. He's then executed as a political move of Dany's part.

I hold these outcomes to be fitting for the series for the following reasons:

1. The series is known for its shocking and unexpected deaths. At this point, most of the fans seem certain that Jaime would stay alive until he completes his redemption arc - so him dying here would fit the ""plot-twist"" criteria the series is famous for.

2. Its not just a twist for the sake of it. It fits perfectly with all the other major deaths we've had. ""Your actions/mistakes catch up to you before you can fulfill your goal"" - this is a recurring theme for GoT deaths. Viserys unwisely trying to force Drogo causes his death before he even gets his hands on an army. Drogo's atrocities causes his death before he can set sail for Westeros. Ned never gets to fix things in KL or ensure his daughters' safety. Renly is poised to become a major threat with the biggest army - but gets killed before the battle even starts. Robb never gets to secure his kingdom or save his sisters. Oberyn never gets to avenge Elia and her children. Tywin never gets to secure his legacy. The element of tragedy is same in all of them - all these characters had a goal or an agenda they were desperate to achieve and all of them died before they could achieve it. Jaime suffering the same fate - of having his actions and his family's catch up to him before he can redeem himself - fits the theme of the series.

3. It preserves the element of realism and character consistency. Most of the theories regarding Jaime surviving require people to start acting out-of-character. Like the Northerners simply getting over their hatred of the Lannisters. Or LSH caring about rational evidence or fair play. Or the BwB being moved by Jaime's speech. Where LSH is concerned, she should want Jaime dead asap and hang the formalities. And with Dany and the North, scapegoating Jaime is a great political move. In the end, it'd show that the logical flow of the story matters more than any one character's journey.

4. It also highlights the difference between character perspective and audience perspective. Most of the audience consider Jaime to be a redeemed good guy but that's because we are privy to his pov. Most of the characters, however, consider him to be the irredeemable villain who caused one of the most devastating civil wars in the history of Westeros because he couldn't keep his hands off his sister.

5. Someone else killing Cersei would be fine as well. Let's be honest - the main reason why people want Jaime to survive and get back to KL is because they want him to be the one who kills Cersei. The irony of him being the Valonqar - the one person Cersei never considered - seems too deliciously ironic to pass up. But that's not essential to the story. In fact, I'd say that twisting the story in unnatural ways just to make that happen would be doing it a disservice.

So based on these reasons, I'm perfectly fine with the possibility of Jaime dying early into the next book/season.

However, here's what I don't understand - the very notion of Jaime dying like this sends a lot of fans into a passionate frenzy. For a lot of them, this outcome is simply unacceptable. For a lot of them, it seems like this end would be the worst thing ever.

Can anyone help me understand this POV? Yes, I get that fans want Jaime to complete his redemption arc and have his story end a particular way - specifically, with killing Cersei - but that's what the fans want. What they want and what the author wants is not the same thing.

So can anyone give me a rational explanation as to why this ending would be so terrible? Beyond what boils down to ""I don't want it to end that way"", that is?

240,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-9-4,2018,9,4,12,9cs56q,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] MORE EVIDENCE TO WHY JON'S CLAIM TO THE THRONE MIGHT NOT BE AS STRONG AS YOU THINK,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9cs56q/spoilers_more_evidence_to_why_jons_claim_to_the/,mrsedgarallenpoe,1536032846,"First, let me say that I really think it could go either way, ""legally"" speaking according to Westerosi succession laws, as Jon's situation includes some details which have never had to be considered before.  I do, however, continue to see people refer to Jon as ""the true heir"" or ""the rightful heir"", as if Dany simply has no claim now because Jon does.....and that just isn't true. If Jon's claim does put him in line before Dany, that doesn't then render her claim illegitimate.  It's just as legit as ever, she'd just be second in line, which actually doesn't matter anyway since 1) Jon would never EVER contest Dany's claim to the throne for himself. He's sworn an oath to her and he won't break it to step in line in front of her for a throne he doesn't even want.  Whether he actually IS first in line or not, the ONLY way Jon will ever take the throne is if Dany dies (which I believe it's possible she might, while giving birth to her and Jon's child).

But let's get back to the whole ""rightful heir""-thing and the claim that Jon is now first in line for the throne.  Is he though?  If all things were ""normal"" and nothing out of the ordinary had happened, then yes, he would be........but that isn't the case.  First, Jon joined the Night's Watch and when he did, whether knowingly or not, he gave up any right to the line of succession, putting Dany first in line.  NW vows are for life.  And here's where things get REALLY murky: does it then mean that because Jon died and was brought back to life that his NW vows actually ended, and he was then put back into the line of succession?  First off, normally if you, for whatever reason, take yourself out of the line of succession, you stay out.....even if you want back in.  But let's say that doesn't apply here.  Since no one in Westeros would've EVER had to deal with this issue before, a person in line for the throne dying and coming back to life, whether or not his NW vows actually still hold, not whether or not he FEELS like they hold, is unknown.  And if all that wasn't enough, Jon is only in line at all because his real father got a secret (SECRET!!!) annulment and then had a SECRET marriage to Jon's mother. The only things that ""prove"" this is a single piece of paper from the Citadel and visions Bran had, which is really hardly enough evidence to convince an entire country that Jon is legit.  That doesn't mean it won't happen, it's just pretty flimsy stuff, really.  There is absolutely NO DOUBT whatsoever, by anyone, that Dany's claim is real.

So, we're really left not knowing if Jon truly is first in line or if the majority would even buy it if he is.  But again, unless Dany dies, the whole thing is moot anyway.

Below is a a better description of all this. The details on succession laws/traditions are based on British monarchies, which is what Hirst based the Westerosi one on. A link is included to the full page:

"" Yes, But The Succession Still Isn't Clear
By and large Westerosi succession tends to follow European law, and there are cases where the former King dies in a period in which his widow-Queen is still fertile, and the Heir Apparent is a woman. There was a case in recent English law where a Queen would have ascended the throne immediately, but they said ""hey, if the King's widow happens to be pregnant and gives birth to a boy, that boy would replace you as King immediately."" (The same hubbub happened when Queen Elizabeth II ascended because it was not impossible her mom was pregnant with a boy).

Obviously very few people in Westeros knew that the annulment had taken place and that Lyanna had a claim to be Rhaegar's legitimate wife, but this is examining from a perspective of us, the viewers, who know The Truth, and puts the Crown as a high-concept thing that is always with the legitimate heir by law, even if nobody knows it.

The position of King by the Crown was temporarily in limbo because Lyanna was pregnant, and the second the boy who would be known as Jon Snow popped out he immediately became the rightful King by Targaryen claims. The Crown followed him, even if, just like Jon Snow, everyone knew nothing about it.

So wait, he's the heir, why do you say the succession isn't clear?
Because it's all Ned Stark's fault.

The only person in Westeros we can know for sure knew this was Ned Stark. He knew Robert would murder the baby on the spot, and he couldn't let that happen to his nephew, so he passed the boy off as his own bastard son.

The Crown still never left Jon Snow, he was still always the rightful heir... until the moment he took the Black.

As always, Jon Snow knew nothing, but Eddard Stark was likely greatly relieved, because at that moment Jon Snow ceased to be the rightful King and it passed to the presumed holder all along, Viserys Targaryen.

Under the principles of the Monarchy Never Dies, There Is Always A Ruler, and the Targaryen claim that they were still the rightful Kings (actually sitting the Iron Throne is irrelevant), Jon Snow had been king from the moment of his birth, and his technical heir ascended to the throne the moment that black cloak hit Jon Snow's shoulders and he became a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

Viserys, of course, died, and since Jon Snow was still in the Watch, it passed to his heir, Daenerys Targaryen. 
But Jon died (and got better), why isn't he the rightful heir, since his vows ended?
Because there is no legal precedent for making a monarch who rightfully and legally inherited the throne to immediately abdicate just because someone popped up along the former line of succession.

The fact that none of these kings sat on the Iron Throne is irrelevant. Coronation doesn't make a person the monarch, they become monarch the moment they inherit it from the former one (or else they wouldn't style themselves Kings and Queens, even in exile).

Don't get me wrong, Jon Snow has a very strong claim, and he could press it in either a legal proceeding (and probably lose) or on the field of battle (and probably lose), or through murder (which doesn't seem Jon's style).

But given that there is no precedent for Jon Snow actually escaping the vows of the Night's Watch, from which only death allows escape, it's unclear if Daenerys would legally be forced to abdicate immediately, or if Jon would merely be re-added to the line of succession (conveniently as Dany's heir, assuming she doesn't give birth to a male child (or female, given that Dany would probably press for a change to the succession laws)).

This is all setting aside the problems Jon would have actually proving his claim, from which all the people in universe would know is, Jon's 'brother' is having visions, and a single book that was conveniently stolen from Oldtown by Jon's best friend (and could therefore be a forgery). We, as the Viewers, know is claim his true and just. But the characters aren't blessed with our omniscience (except maybe Bran...).""

I only started watching about a month ago, and then binged all 7 seasons in a matter of weeks. I liked it much more than I thought I would. So forgive me if this topic has already been discussed at great length, but like I said, Im new!
So I think its pretty clear each Stark childs wolf is symbolic of the Stark child themselves: Jons wolf is named Ghost, and Jon died and came back, a little like a ghost. Brans wolf died in the cave, just like Brans former self died in the cave. Sansas wolf was cut down young at the hands of the Lannisters, just like Sansa was taken from her family young and had her innocence stripped away prematurely, etc.
Aryas also seems straight forward, as she sent her wolf on the run, and Arya spent much of the series on the run herself. But then, when she encounters that dire wolf in the forest, she determines, thats not you.

This post end at  season 3,  I'll make a few corrections / additions in **bold and continue their work .**

 

&gt;**Season 1**  
Lannisters march for Tyrion:  
&gt;  
&gt;**S1E3 Maester Aemon says that there is less than a thousand men in the Nights Watch.**  
*S01E07* 5:30 min in - Tywin says he'll give Jaime half of his forces, 30000 men, to head to Riverrun while Tywin's 30000 head to the Vale to free Tyrion.The North's march for Ned Stark:  
*S01E08* 40min in: Robb says his scouts report reinforcements for Tywin's army from the south (don't know if it's from King's Landing) are headed to join up with Tywin's 30000, the reinforcements are larger than Tywin's 30000. Robb then tells his mother the Northerners have 18000 at that point. Tywin gets reported Robb's forces have rushed into The Neck. A couple minutes later, Robb's battle map shows he's past Greywater Watch, halfway to The Twins, with Jamie's forces a little southwest of Riverrun, and Tywin's forces south of the river, north of Harrenhal. The Northerners capture a Lannister scout who says he counted 20000 Northerners before he got caught (I don't know if he's lying).  
*S01E09* 6:45min in - Theon says Robb has 5 times more men than the Freys do at The Twins, making the Frey army 4000 men (a ton of foreshowing in this scene btw). Frey gives all of his men except 400 to Robb under the conditions **(This 400 probably are like a Household Guard).** I'm assuming Robb is +3600 at this point, but Robb goes -2000 after sending them against Tywin's forces. Jamie's forces get wiped out, but nothing about the loses on either side after this battle near Riverrun.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Also Yoren says to arya that Ned Strak have 50 men of their Household Guard at KL. Also Ned sends 100 men to capture The Mountain. Ned says to littlefinger that Cersei have a dozen of Knights ( maybe the Kingsguard and others) and a hundred of men, also says that the City Watch have 2000 strong men.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season 1 Summary**  
Starks and their bannermen = **21600**  
Lannisters = +60000  
Daenerys = Three baby dragons **(and some Dothraky with horses)**.  
**Season 2**  
*S02E01 - S02E04* \- Robb says if he allies with Renly Baratheon, They'll outnumber the Lannisters 2:1 **(Renly 100000 plus Robb +20000 is +120000/2 is 60000 Lannisters,  that means that somehow after 3 defeats the Lannisters still have more than 60000 men)** **Robb says that Balon Greyjoy have 200 ships,** **taking into account that the crew of the Sea Bitch (Theon) was 22 and that of the Sea Wind (Yara) was 50 ironborn that means a total of 4400-10000 ironborn.** Salladhor Saan says Stannis has the smallest army out of all the kings. Renly + Tyrells stand at 100000 men. Robb has another battle, 5 Lannister men fall for every Stark man, and it's getting really hazy where their number stands. **I remember that Craster says to Jeor that Mance Rayder have 100000 wildings, confirmed lately.**  
*S02E05* \- Stannis gathers the Baratheon bannermen fighting for Renly while the Tyrells take their army to meet up with Tywin's. I have no idea where Renly's assassination takes place nor how their army was split up. **Tyrion have 7800 pots of wildfire...Rodrick Cassel recruit 200 ""decent men"" when the ironborn attack Torrhens Square.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**S2E6 The letter that Arya stole from Tywin says that 10000 northmen march to the Golden Tooth.**  
*S02E07-08* Robb's forces are located south of the Pyke at The Crag to negotiate a surrender, it's right above Castamere. I never realized until now he's right above Casterly Rock. Tywin's army heads to King's Landing before meeting up with the Tyrells. **Roose Bolton sends Ramsay with a few hundred (500) to recapture Winterfell.**   **Tyrion tells Ceresi that 200 ships of the Stannis Royal Fleet was seen north of Tarth, 30 are from Saans fleet.**  
*S02E09 - S02E10* Stannis vs. the Lannisters/Tyrells. I didn't try very hard, but I couldn't find the number of men on either side in either episode. **( Mathos says that they outnumber the KL defense by 5: 1 - Gold Cloaks and Lannister guards - and 10-1 their fleet, so the Royal Fleet of KL is 20 ships, as for the numbers of soldiers I could not find a source that says how many Stannis had)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season 2 Summary**  
Starks and their bannermen  **+20000**  
Lannisters + Tyrells = +100000 I'm assuming, at least 80000.  
Stannis - After a quick glance, I realize they never say the number of men in Stannis' army, someone correct me if I'm wrong. **200 ships (30 sellsails)**  
Daenerys - 3 Tiny Dragons, some Dothraki and a ship.  
**Season 3**  
*S03E01 - S03E04* \- Robb's forces are at Harrenhal coming all the way from the west. He then heads west again to Riverrun for his Grandfather's funeral. No numbers still.  
*S03E05 - S03E08* \- Robb beheads Rickard Karstark and loses ""almost half his forces"". If the 20000 was correct before, it probably means the remaining forces are at 11000 - 12000 men. He heads to Casterly Rock again, but not before going to the Twins for Frey's men, again. **- I sincerely believe that Karstark has an absurd number of men.**  
 **S3E9 Red Wedding**

I left out some parts that were already written in the comments like Lady Olenna telling Tyrion in S03E05 18 minutes in she donated

&gt;12000 infantry men  
1800 mounted lancers  
2000 in support

to the Crown.

Daenerys stands at 8000 Unsullied and 2000 from the Second Sons.

**Season 4**

S4E6  Stannis and Davos at the Iron Bank say they have 4000 men and 32 ships after Blackwater, **keeping this in mind I would say that if 4000 men are on 32 ships then 200/32 = 6.25 \* 4000 = 25000 men that Stannis PROBABLY had before Blackwater, if we take into account Mathos's comment on how they outnumbered the KL defense, it means that Tyrion commanded 5000 men, of these 5000 we know that 2000 were gold cloaks, but I could not say the number of Lannister guards if there were conscripts of the City Watch.**  
S4E8-S4E9 After the wilding attack in Moles Town there is 100 crows in Castle Black against 100000 wildings, 50 crows die at the following battle.

This images show that there is 2774 cavalry in Stannis army.

*S02E01 - S02E04* \- Robb says if he allies with Renly Baratheon, They'll outnumber the Lannisters 2:1 **(Renly 100000 plus Robb +20000 is +120000/2 is 60000 Lannisters, that means that somehow after 3 defeats the Lannisters still have more than 60000 men)** **Robb says that Balon Greyjoy have 200 ships,** **taking into account that the crew of the Sea Bitch (Theon) was 22 and that of the Sea Wind (Yara) was 50 ironborn that means a total of 4400-10000 ironborn.** Salladhor Saan says Stannis has the smallest army out of all the kings. Renly + Tyrells stand at 100000 men. Robb has another battle, 5 Lannister men fall for every Stark man, and it's getting really hazy where their number stands. **I remember that Craster says to Jeor that Mance Rayder have 100000 wildings, confirmed lately.**  
*S02E05* \- Stannis gathers the Baratheon bannermen fighting for Renly while the Tyrells take their army to meet up with Tywin's. I have no idea where Renly's assassination takes place nor how their army was split up. **Tyrion have 7800 pots of wildfire...Rodrick Cassel recruit 200 ""decent men"" when the ironborn attack Torrhens Square.**  
**S2E6 The letter that Arya stole from Tywin says that 10000 northmen march to the Golden Tooth.**  
***S02E07-08*** **Robb's forces are located south of the Pyke at The Crag to negotiate a surrender, it's right above Castamere. I never realized until now he's right above Casterly Rock. Tywin's army heads to King's Landing before meeting up with the Tyrells. Roose Bolton sends Ramsay with a few hundred (500) to recapture Winterfell. Tyrion tells Ceresi that 200 ships of the Stannis Royal Fleet was seen north of Tarth, 30 are from Saans fleet.**  
*S02E09 - S02E10* Stannis vs. the Lannisters/Tyrells. I didn't try very hard, but I couldn't find the number of men on either side in either episode. **( Mathos says that they outnumber the KL defense by 5: 1 - Gold Cloaks and Lannister guards - and 10-1 their fleet, so the Royal Fleet of KL is 20 ships, as for the numbers of soldiers I could not find a source that says how many Stannis had)**  
**Season 2 Summary**  
Starks and their bannermen **+20000**  
Lannisters + Tyrells = +100000 .  
Stannis - After a quick glance, I realize they never say the number of men in Stannis' army, someone correct me if I'm wrong. **200 ships (30 sellsails)**  
Daenerys - 3 Tiny Dragons, some Dothraki and a ship.  
**Nights Watch 1000**  
**Free Folk 1000000**  
***Season 3***  
*S03E01 - S03E04* \- Robb's forces are at Harrenhal coming all the way from the west. He then heads west again to Riverrun for his Grandfather's funeral. No numbers still. **Tywin says that 20000 northmen have know of the scape of Jaime.**  
*S03E05 - S03E08* \- Robb beheads Rickard Karstark and loses ""almost half his forces"". If the 20000 was correct before, it probably means the remaining forces are at 11000 - 12000 men. He heads to Casterly Rock again, but not before going to the Twins for Frey's men, again. **- I sincerely believe that Karstark has an absurd number of men.**  
**S3E9 Red Wedding**

I left out some parts that were already written in the comments like Lady Olenna telling Tyrion in S03E05 18 minutes in she donated

&gt;12000 infantry men  
1800 mounted lancers  
2000 in support **( WTF is support?)**

to the Crown.

Daenerys stands at 8000 Unsullied and 2000 from the Second Sons.

**Free Folk 1000000 and 3 giants.**

**Season 4**

S4E6 Stannis and Davos at the Iron Bank say they have 4000 men and 32 ships after Blackwater, \*\*keeping this in mind I would say that if 4000 men are on 32 ships then 200/32 = 6.25 \* 4000 = 25000 men that Stannis PROBABLY had before Blackwater, if we take into account Mathos's comment on how they outnumbered the KL defense, it means that Tyrion commanded 5000 men, of these 5000 we know that 2000 were gold cloaks, but I could not say the number of Lannister guards if there were conscripts of the City Watch.

S4E8-S4E9 After the wilding attack in Moles Town there is 100 crows in Castle Black against 100000 wildings, thousands of wildings, 2 giants and 50 crows die at the following battle.

This images show that there is 2774 cavalry in Stannis army.

While im catching a lot of things the 2nd time around, I have a question about the season 7 finale.

In the finale we see Jon demonstrate how to kill the wights with the wight they captured. Before stabbing it with the dragon glass, the Hound had sliced it in half with a normal sword and it was still alive

However, in the previous episode during the suicide mission as well as in Hardhome, many people were killing wights with average weapons (highly doubt any were made of dragon glass or valyrian steel). Correct me if im wrong but isnt it only the white walkers that the dragon glass / valyrian steel are used for to kill? And wights can be killed with any weapon? If so, why didnt the wight they captured die a lot easier or quicker when the Hound used his sword?

I honestly thought ""Breaking Bad is in my top 3 fav shows ever (Along with GoT) but damn I'm sure all of us saw the ending coming (Walt dying while saving Jesse and finally admitting to his wife that he did all those things because he actually enjoyed it) a mile away"" it was a predictable ending and a great one, I feel Game Of Thrones has become so big and has masterfully created a fantasy world where almost everything seems to click, that now we nitpick the show on every minor detail (expectations for S8 are just one example).

I guess it goes to show how it's made us grow to expect the very best from it. :)",22,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

https://motmansy.polldaddy.com/s/the-best-game-of-thrones-characters-of-2018
It has been over a year since the second season of Game of Thrones has come to an end. Yet again, I want to investigate whether public opinion toward the selection of the best Game of Thrones has changed over the course of the year. Last edition, Daenerys Targaryen took over the spot of Jon Snow as the best character of the epic TV series. Is the Dragon Queen still as popular after a year that the last season has aired? Its time for the Redditors to gather and vote for the fourth edition of the Top 50 best Game of Thrones characters!
Rules
- You can only vote for 10 characters, no less. Its entirely up to you if youd like to vote for fewer characters than 10.
- Deadline for voting: Wednesday, September 12th. Results will be online before next weekend, right before the Emmys take place.
- It would be awesome if you upvote my post. The more people to see the post, the more votes I get which will add up to an even more reliable top 50. And to be frank, Im not into upvote whoring.
- Please dont troll vote! I remember a LOT of votes for Grey Worm in a past year. ;-)
- If I have forgotten one of your favourite characters on the list, please let me know via a comment in Polldaddy. Ill try to include your character asap. Normally all TV characters are included. Note that this poll only measures the popularity of the TV characters, not the book characters!

Four criteria (which can help you to choose your 10 favourite characters)
- The acting of the actor/actress =&gt; Did the actor/actress ever touch your soul with his/her performance? How good is the actor/actress in expressing her feelings in Game of Thrones? Are the actors / actresss acting skills consistent throughout all the season(s)?
- The storyline(s) of the character =&gt; Were/was the storyline(s) of the character consistently interesting? Was there a strong building-up in her/his storyline each season? Was/Were the storyline(s) of the character not too predictable? Was the characters fleshed out enough each season? How was the pace of his/her storyline(s)?
- Character development =&gt; How good is the character fleshed out? Does the character have enough depth? Is he/she likable in her/his role? Did the character develop each season and how strong was this development? Look at the characters current state: how strong was his development up to now?
- The uniqueness of the character =&gt; Did the characters actions surprise through the seasons of Game of Thrones? Wasnt the character too repetitive in his/her actions? Did the character never cease to amaze you or did he/she ever started to bore you?

The New 3DS XL is adult owned, and has skinomi protectors on the front plate, back plate, and lower screen of the 3DS. There are light scuff marks on the top screen that can only be seen if powered off and held in a angle, they are non visible during use. The 3DS has been installed with the latest CFW, which is completely safe to update and use. The 3DS will not be coming with any games, what you see on the menu is what you can play as long as CFW is still on the system. Im firm on $200 shipped via USPS, it will be packaged safely.

The Binding of Issac is in great condition and works perfectly. The case itself has a few light scratches that are hard to photograph, and it did not come with a manual when I purchased it from Walmart for some reason. Firm on $24.50 shipped.

Monster Hunter XX is in great condition, the game works perfectly but is in Japanese. $24 shipped.

Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is brand new and still sealed, Im firm on $55 shipped.

The honey is unopened and currently out of production as of 2016, its officially licensed from Capcom japan. Was a pain in the ass to import, but Ill let it go for $20 shipped.

All sales will be through PayPal Goods &amp; Services, I will not accept any other forms of payment.

431,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-9-6,2018,9,6,23,9diwwf,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Persecuted Deliverer Motif,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9diwwf/spoilers_persecuted_deliverer_motif/,kaufman79,1536242728,"GRRM loves using tropes and motifs rather liberally, then adding a unique twist, which is part of what makes his work so great. The one I want to focus on now is that of the persecuted deliverer.

As far as I can tell the oldest literary example of this motif is the Egyptian story of the persecution of Horus. Seth kills his brother Osiris, and scatters his chopped up body in the Nile. Osiris' wife Isis gathers his pieces (and makes a golden phallus, since a fish ate the original), wraps them up in bandages (supposed origins of mummification) and resuscitates him just long enough to conceive. Some time later she gives birth to Horus. Because Seth knows Horus will grow up to be a powerful figure and want revenge one day, Seth seeks to kill Horus as a baby. Isis hides Horus in the Nile, where he is rescued by his aunt who raises him to maturity. Eventually, Horus does grow up and defeats Seth, and is king over Egypt (Pharaoh is an incarnation of Horus).

The story of Moses is seemingly the second oldest, and of course is a very similar story. Plagiarism or copying is not the right word here, as it seems the story (and the broader narrative) are intentionally similar in order to polemically use Egypts own story against her. 

Then we have the story of Sargon of Akkad (probably written long after the historical figure), who is in some sort of danger (no details given), is born in secret, is placed in the rivers, then found and raised by some guy. Sargon grows up in obscurity, and then becomes ruler and deliverer of his kingdom.

Greco-Roman culture had their versions of the story too, notably Romulus and Remus, and Perseus. 

Then of course is Jesus. Sought to be killed by Herod, his mother flees to Egypt before returning home, Jesus grows up in obscurity, and becomes the savior.


This motif has made its way into popular culture as well, most notably with Superman, and Harry Potter. Aragorn of LOTR shares many similarities too.

In essence the story is this:
The persecuted infant with a mysterious birth, a threat to power (kingly or otherwise) narrowly escapes death, is raised by non-parent - often a relative, (Jesus is the sorta exception), grows up in obscurity, and becomes the savior figure.

Finally, Jon Snow, a mysterious birth, whose life would be ended if Robert found out, is rescued and raised by his uncle, grows up in obscurity, and becomes the deliverer. 

Gimme your thoughts! How aware of this were you? Can you think of other motifs in GoT? Cause there are a lot!

(an aside: I know this touches on religious figures and texts. Please dont make this a religious debate. Im not saying this discredits Judaism/Christianity or anything like that.)",8,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

First off, Casterly Rock is the ancestral home for House Lannister. The Rock is known for having flowing gold mines until recent history.

Secondly, House Lannister holds the crown. Throughout the show the crown falls down through the Lannisters by way of the line of succession. 

The point I am trying to make is how the Lannisters didnt really work for their wealth. They just happened to live on land with gold. With the exception of Tywin no Lannisters have earned their wealth such as they havent earned the right to wear the crown. Tommen and Joffrey arent even Baratheons. Then in the show the Gold mines run dry. The crown runs dry for them also as everyone of them to put on the unappreciated, unearned crown dies. 

Just thought it was a funny weird coincidence. I noticed and thought Id share. Thanks for reading.",26,84,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm not saying those are not good characters at all, in fact they're some of the best. However I'm just curios to know which characters you don't really know how to feel about. For example, for me like/dislike would be Daenerys, I like her intentions in general, I think most of the time she tries to do the right thing but then there are times when I really disapprove her actions (When she killed the Tarlys, and the Masters). Love/hate could be Varys, Idk, sometimes I felt (especially in the first few seasons) that he was a traitor and only cared about himself like Littlefinger and despised him, but then he has these amazing lines/quotes that really put everything (power, loyalty, honor) in perspective that I LOVE.

In the situation that the Kingdom finds itself in during the first season, he's clearly not the right guy for the job - a disinterested administrator, personally unfaithful and boorish, spends the Kingdom into debt, and on top of that let himself go to the point that he can't even manage to squeeze into his old armor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But one thing that seems to have kept him in power in spite of all these manifest flaws was that the man was a rare combination of a person who was both brilliant at personal combat, as well as leading armies. If I recall right, Randyll Tarly was the only opponent he faced on the field of battle (Battle of Ashford) who ever bested him - and that amounted to an orderly withdrawal of his offensive and was not a serious setback.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a bit curious - given the situation that the Realm finds itself in at the end of Season 7, those flaws from Season 1 seem the complaints of luxury and peace in retrospect. If Robert had a real war and target for the Realm to rally behind, how do you think he would have done against Dany's forces or the Night King assuming he was still in power.",5,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Weiss should not be blamed for the decline in Game Of Thrones storytelling quality [No Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9dvyp5/why_david_benioff_and_db_weiss_should_not_be/,lbds95,1536337656,"I will begin by saying this is obviously my own opinion from the evidence I have seen, and obviously anyone is free to disagree. I rarely engage in internet debates, but this is something I felt the need to comment on as both a huge fan of both the show and the books.

All over reddit, social media, and pretty much every corner of the internet, I see people blaming David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for the decline in Game Of Thrones storytelling; rushed plots, stretching the laws of time and travel, etc. and I feel I have to draw attention to the very clear reasons that they should not be blamed. They have been given an impossible task that is no fault of their own, and here is why;

* George RR Martin spoke with D&amp;D and completely approved of them adapting ASOIAF into a TV series many years ago. He gave them his blessing and approval. And, no matter what, I think we can all agree that they did a FANTASTIC job adapting the first 3 books into 4 seasons of television. Probably the best series of television we've ever seen, and will see for a long time. They followed the books loyally, knew what to include and what to exclude due to the series' size (for the vast majority of the material anyway), and even included some incredible scenes that were not in the books; Cat talking about Jon Snow to Talisa for example.
* Now I know certain aspects of the TV show began to dwindle around the time they began adapting material from AFFC. That being said, George himself has stated he is a gardener who doesn't plan many aspects of his novel, and just lets it grow. It's a very popular opinion that, after ASOS, the book series spirals out of control and becomes very muddled. Wit that, there is a limit to how much you can produce for/include in a television show; if George's writing is going to spiral, then obviously D&amp;D's job is going to become equally difficult and their writing will become muddled too. The series begins to falter at the same point in both the show and the books; around the beginning of AFFC, which is both the weakest book and the beginning of the downfall of certain aspects of the show. If George can't fully control his own story that he has spent many, many years writing, then how could the people adapting it be expected to do so?
* George originally stated that he planned on releasing TWOW by 2014, the same year that season 4 came out. Had this been accurate, then the showrunners would still have plenty of material to work with. However, 2014 was nearly 5 years ago. D&amp;D could not have prepared for this HUGE delay, nor could they have been expected to. When George gave them the rights, he gave them a VERY inaccurate estimate of how quickly the series would continue, and they were only told that this would not be the case once they were multiple seasons deep. By then, clearly, there is no turning back for many reasons; actors grow older, momentum dies when a book/TV series stops being released regularly (clearly shown by the dwindling interest in the book series), and more. If they HAD waited for TWOW before beginning season 6 to ensure they still had material to work with, then the show STILL would not have progressed past season 5, and would not be doing so for the foreseeable future. This is not only unreasonable to ask, but practically impossible from a technical standpoint. So basically, the writers' only choice was to do what they would on their own with little to no help from George.
* Now let's consider the immensity of ASOIAF. This is a series that has become so complex that the creator of the world, story, and characters himself is struggling to finish a single book in the space of a decade. Yet D&amp;D have had the nightmarish task of writing a full season in a matter of months ON A YEARLY BASIS. This isn't even their story, yet they're having to adapt it almost 10x faster than it's creator - and by now, there isn't even anything to adapt. OF COURSE there's going to be a decline in quality. Who could honestly say they would do a better job?
* And finally, I will not say D&amp;D haven't made some avoidable mistakes, but George is easily mostly to blame here. Not only has he taken almost FIVE YEARS LONGER than he originally stated to finish the books (so far), but he is completely refusing to help D&amp;D finish the show. He has only given them very basic plot points of how the story ends a few years ago, and that's it. He refuses to divulge any important information to help them know where to take the story, even though it's his own doing that the show has surpassed the books. He has seemingly completely abandoned and disregarded Game Of Thrones due to its declining quality, even though he himself is clearly unable to produce more of the story - and it's his own damn book series,

In summary, George has missed every deadline he has been set for TWOW, and as a result he has left D&amp;D stranded after giving them wildly incorrect and overly optimistic information about when the series would be finished. Even though he cannot finish a single book in nearly 8 years, he is completely abandoning them and refusing to help, knowing full well that D&amp;D have to produce material almost 10x the rate he has been doing on an almost yearly basis - and it isn't even their story. AND they now have nothing to work with, no thanks to George. He cannot finish his own story, and he has completely turned away from those who are trying to loyally develop it as best they can with what no material to follow. He won't promote or lend a hand in any way - he is bitter at them for not finishing HIS story to a high standard, when he cannot finish himself at all.

To me it is clear that nobody is to blame but George RR Martin. By this point, given the evidence, there is no reason to claim otherwise. All we can hope for by now is that the wait for TWOW is worth it, thought the odds of this series ever being fully finished are unpromising at best.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

It has been over a year since the seventh season of Game of Thrones has come to an end. Yet again, I want to investigate whether public opinion toward the selection of the best Game of Thrones has changed over the course of the year.

But the best death imo has to be Grenn.  He gets charged with holding the gate and him and the others he takes with him get the job done.  He gets his super badass moment where he recites the watch's oath and we see that he died after he stabbed the giant in the chest, probably killing him.

For a kid born on a farm who couldn't use a sword for shit he ended up possibly saving the 7 kingdoms from wildling invasion and killing the king of the giants.

For worst death I have to give it to Areo Hotah.  Dude had such an awesome vibe going and then doesn't even get a fight scene, he just gets stabbed in the back and died.

So heres my theory.

I think by now everybody has heard that Littlefinger is alive because he is one of the facelessmen and bran knows this he knows everything past, present and future. And based on how the show loves to bring it back around like the bloodwitch saying to dany that the only time youll see drogo agaim and her son is when you know its not true because the sign rises in west and ends in the east yadiyada. So my point is brand deliberately set of the chain of events or the chaos ladder by letting littlefinger know that he is in danger by saying that very worss chaos is a ladder and that dagger is that very symbol we only saw that dagger back on season 1 where it all began. So basically like Dr. Strange bran knew it had to be done for the end game a necessary sacrifice and that he knows arya will kill littlefinger thats why he gave it to her as an ironic symbol for us the viewers.

Yes it is possible the cave drawing could've been because the children misinterpreted his appearance and thought he had a beard or maybe just so it's easier to make him stand out more or maybe the cave drawing is of a vision of the future (but that's another story for another time) but I believe that he is not the same as the NK we see in the flesh.

Okay so if the NK in the cave Drawings is not the same one we see going up against Jon and co. or the one who really wants Bran then who is he? Well to find who he is we should start by looking at the storyboards for the scene where the NK is first turned by the children, One of the big things I notice was in the story boards it mentions he Is a ""Andal in Agony"" yes while they do spell Andal wrong as they spell it as Andle and not Andal I think this should still be a red flag.

Why would the person being turned be an Andal and not a First man if the NK is suppose to be the first WW. Well I believe the Night King is NOT the first WW and the WW's existed before him, and that in reality the NK is the result of a forbidden love between an Andal Warrior Prince and a Northern/Stark Girl. a believe a small division of Andals came to Westeros long before the Andal invasion and that one of them a Warrior Prince (whom also could've being Bael the Bard of Legend or atleast the inspiration for the legend) had fallen in love with a Northern/Stark Girl, leaving her with a child and that child grew up to the NK before being turned by the children (it's also possible he could've been the 13th Lord Commander/Last Hero of Legend/Night's King of legend but i'll save that for a different post). I also believe this child was the original Lightbringer (with the Andal warrior Prince being the original Azor Ahai/PTWP and the Stark girl being Nissa Nissa) and help ended the original long night, But at some point (maybe around the time the Andal were arriving) he was kidnapped by the children and turned into the NK.

So evidence do I have that the NK is the result of a forbidden love between An Andal and a Stark girl:

- Well of course in the story boards for when he is being turned it says he is an ""Andal in agony"" Not a first man or a Stark.

- The timeline is very messy so we don't know if the timeline really is in the true order that we are led to believe it is in. In fact when the synopsis for the Age of Heroes spin-off came out it stated that ""the history and legends of Westeros is not what we think it is""

- Not only would it make a nice parallel with Rhaegar and Lyanna but also with Jon as the NK would've been a bastard as well.

- The NK in human form does not really look like what i'd imagine a first man to look like as he looks to clean shaven and his hair does not look wild or anything like that.

- Also he is blonde not brown hair or black haired like most northerners are.

- Also the way the creation scene is edited it looks like parts of it where left out and also what the children are saying is inaudible, similar to how when we first saw Jon's birth what Lyanna whispered to Ned was inaudible. Could it be D&amp;D are trying to hide a big twist.

- As for why there is no snow, well simple. the WW's may have been further south at the time or completely defeated as there was no leader at that time until the new NK (the one seen in the show) was created.

- It would also give NK some motivation for why he is attacking, he wants to get revenge on the Andals and and humanity as a whole and also is threatened by the birth of another baby that is the result of a love being a Northerner and a Southerner (that baby being Jon)

So in conclusion I believe the NK is the original Lightbringer and the result of a forbidden love of a Andal warrior Prince A stark girl and that when the Andals invaded he was found by the children and turned into the new NK and wants revenge on humanity for making him a bastard and keeping his mother and father apart. Also to end the curse the children put on him, being threaten by the burning of Weirwood under orders from the Lord of Light, and also threatened by Jon's birth.",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is one of my all time favorite Jamie scenes. The picture he paints to Edmure is perfect: *This isnt a negotiation, youre asking about my honor or alignment, its to Cersei and IDGAF how you feel about that. You surrender or I start butchering people to get back to her.*

It really set Edmure up with not *too* bad a deal. *Go home, save your people, dont die by making me take the caste because I will. He gets to be the Tully that brought them back into the 7 Kingdoms after a failed rebellion.* And as far as offers after a failed rebellion go... I feel like thats not a bad offer.

The warlock hid her dragons to lure her inside and trap her - but did he not think that they might burn him (which is exactly what happened)?

As for the ""richest man"" of Qarth, he made a deal with the warlock to kill the rest of the 13 and have the place to themselves? Also, so it turns out his vault was empty - let's say Daenerys had agreed to marry him on the condition that half the vault was his, doesnt he know she is eventually going to find out it's a lie and leave the marriage or have him killed?

It seems like someone of Tywins character and abilities would have some inside knowledge of the murder of the king, his grandson. He obviously wasnt too fond of Joffrey for starting the war of 5 kings and his little twat ways and although he had control over Joffrey, maybe he felt as he got older and bolder, he may have lost some of that control over him. Not to mention all the potential problems Joffrey would create that Tywin would then have to fix. This is the game of thrones after all and its all about amassing power and keeping it; Joffrey was too much of a wild card. So it makes me wonder if Tywin at least had an idea after the fact, if not before and didnt really give a shit. And the added bonus was he would be able to have a mock trial for tyrion and ship his ass to the wall. ",4,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

The way she always looks at the camera dramatically before saying ""dracares"" and seeing one of her dragons burn something while she has a little grin on her face makes me want to just mute any scene with Daenerys Targaryen in it. I feel like every other character has to go through so much struggle character development and depth to them. Lets take Jamie for example. His character development is amazing, he went from one of the most hated characters in the show to my favorite character because of everything he had to go through in order to get back with his family. You can clearly see how he has changed as a person from season 1 to the current season, his character has traits that make him seem human where he is not a perfect person, but you can tell he has good intentions. Meanwhile you got Danny who really has only taken W's since season 1. The only time in the entire show where Daenerys really had some type of struggle is when the Khal died and most of the Dothraki abandoned her, but even after that she gets free entrance into the richest city in Westeros and she ends up beating some silly little trick with the theft of her dragons and pillages the entire city. She then gets an army of the strongest soldiers in the 7 kingdoms basically for free and just wins every battle after that. There is not a single time in the show where you are ever worried about the mortality of Daenerys and it is just so damn boring. She is the typical ""good guy"" where she can do no wrong and is protected by a suit of plot armor. On top of that her acting is so overrated. I think every actor and actress in the show has been amazing at making that character seem real, but not daenerys, every scene with her is the same. She has a little half smirk on her face while she is talking to anyone and always has this attitude of high and mighty. She always has in my opinion boring dialog, with really cringy reactions to everything with her typical smirk. I feel like if any other female character in the show switched rolls with the actress for Daenerys, they would do a much better job at representing that character with the exception of Cersi because lets me honest Cersi is just way too good at her roll. I know this seems like I am really bullying here, but lets make this a discussion. What are everyone else's thoughts on Daenerys Taragyen?",71,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

[Optional rant below]

I was re-watching the clip of Cersei berating Jaime when he was preparing his military leaders for the expedition north. I already understand her reasoning in that if the Daenerys's forces prevail, they will be weakened to the point of feasible defeat. However, if the Whitewalkers were to prevail, and knowing you can kill them with fire, maybe it wasn't such an insane risk to renege on her promise. 

In fact, why hasn't Daenerys's forces thought about possibly obtaining wildfire and weaponizing it to more effectively and safely combat the Whitewalkers? I feel like this could be a minor plothole since her anyone that's anyone has heard about the Battle of Blackwater Bay and the wildfire shenanigans.

With football season here, we all see power rankings for the 32 professional teams. I enjoy reading other peoples thoughts on the football teams. Somehow, arbitrarily ranking the teams and watching how the rankings change throughout the season makes reading more enjoyable.  So, I have decided that I am going to do that too. But, since I have seen the series through season 7, I have already developed opinions about the characters, and it will be hard to not have a bias. So, these rankings are from my girlfriend, Andrea. She has not seen the series, nor has she read the books.  She has given me her thoughts, and I am sharing with you.  I should note, that if a character isnt ranked, that character didnt make a big enough impression on her. So, lets begin:

**The LIVING characters:**

**12. Viserys Targaryen**

Perhaps being a creepy brother is perhaps not the best way of making an impression on a lady or anybody for that matter. But, the hope for this character is that he will die of syphilis, or be eaten by a dragon. Its interesting that Viserys thinks of himself as a dragon, yet Andrea wants him to be eaten by a dragon.  Can you eat yourself? Either way, Viserys has earned the most hated character to this point.

**11. Khal Drogo**

Better known as the animal, Khal Drogo is still in the hated range for Andrea. Despite Drogo being one of the most impressive killing machines around, Andrea thinks that Daenerys is going to kill him, and take over his kingdom.  There is not much to say about Drogo except that he is just a brute. Thus, he has the nick-name the animal.

**10. Tyrion Lannister (The Dwarf)**

Hes just going to keep f@#king and drinking and be an annoying character. Tyrion is the third most despised character. And, this list includes Jamie who pushed Bran out a window. That seems pretty harsh, but perhaps women want more from men than sleeping around and drinking. Who knew? Maybe its because hes a dwarf, and dwarfs always are just there to be an annoying character.

**9. Robert Baratheon** 

Not much to say about Robert other than he is just going to be fat and drunk for awhile before he is f@#ked up by his cheating wife. He may fight a few wars before he gets killed off. Again, sleeping around and drinking all night isnt the best way to impress women.

**8 Cersei Lannister, 7 Jamie Lannister**

Okay, if Cersei is married to Robert why is she still Cersei Lannister and not Cersei Baratheon? That point seems to glossed over.  The future for these two is that Cersei is going to get pregnant, and the king is going to know hes not the father. But, the king is spineless and will not do anything about it. Because, well, you know, the kingdom needs stability. In the end, these two will cause trouble. As if pushing a kid out a window isnt causing trouble.

**6. Sansa Stark**

Better known as the red head, Sansa is the first character to be in the not dis-liked category. Sansa is going to get married off to the punk blonde boy, and hes going to be very evil.

**5. Catelyn Stark**

So, Catelyn is going to be a suffering widow (see Eddard below for more details on this one). She is going to be pining for children, and fade off into a miserable oblivion. Man, I wouldnt want to be her. But, at least shes liked.

**4. Eddard Stark (Lord of Winterfell)**

Hmmm, Eddard is going to die. Hes going to suffer awhile, then hes going to die. But, hes liked too.

**3. Brandon Stark**

The third most favorite character of the series so far, and Hes going to die. Of course, he is in middle of plunging to his death at the end of the episode, so its not much of a stretch to predict his death.

**2. Daenerys Targaryen**  

The second most favorite character so far is Daenerys. The prediction for Daenerys is that she is going to grow up and be more confident. She is going to kick some ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Arya Stark**

The favorite character so far in the series is Arya Stark. She is spunky! You need to keep an eye on this one. She will amount to something!!!

&amp;#x200B;

There you have have it. The first episode's character rankings. Please know, that any predictions here are based on someone who has only seen through episode 1 of season 1. The predictions may be correct, or wrong. For those that have seen further, please put spoiler alerts if you want to comment about a prediction. Also, I would be interested to see what you think about the rankings. Who would you move up, who would you move down?  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking forward to see how well the characters rank in future episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

As a bonus:

Not Ranked:  

Joffrey Baratheon - even though he wasnt on the list, if you looked at Sansa above, Joffrey is the punk blonde boy who is going to be very evil.

&amp;#x200B;

The DEAD characters

1. Will - may he rest in peace. He had useful information, but no-one takes him seriously. He was twitchy.
2. The other two were just generic characters who really didnt matter",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A movie or a show can only be as beautiful as the camera captures the story. The cinematography in Game of Thrones is gorgeous and so unique when compared to most TV shows. What makes Game of Thrones grand is the scope of the show and the camera crew on the show have fully done justice to capturing this grand feel particularly the action scenes and the epic locations of the show. The general opinion is that the music an VFX on Thrones has been excellent throughout whereas its other strong aspects (writing, acting) have suffered somewhat of a slight decline. The cinematographers of GoT deserve a mention as well because the show consistently leaves me visually stunned. Below are a couple of scenes and a few images from season 7 that demonstrate my point:

Because I think that they should address the fact that Arya was kindof stepping out of line alittle last season, and Jon I think needs/should see his sister is not the person she once was, she has changed.

Now, some people may think this is a stupid question, but I'll ask it anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

When Tyrion comes upon Tywin on the shitter and has the crossbow pointed at him, Tywin keeps mentioning to let him get off the pot and they can talk in his chambers. He keeps saying he'd never let Tyrion be executed and whatnot, which Tyrion obviously doesn't believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is simple: Do you think Tywin was telling the truth when he said he'd never let Tyrion be executed? My initial gut feeling is that he was lying, only trying to get to a safer spot so he could alert guards, talk Tyrion down (before executing him, etc.) and he clearly wants him dead anyway. But, my only holdup is that when he mentions to Tyrion he wanted to let him die as a baby- but didn't because he was a LANNISTER \*emphasis intended\*- it makes me wonder if he was indeed telling the truth and was going to let him go to the Night's Watch, basically letting him live again, because of his name. The point has been made that Tywin DIDN'T ever believe Tyrion actually killed Joffrey, but was using the opportunity that arose to kill off Tyrion as he's always wanted to do. That i see, and can agree with. But still, it makes me wonder if there's even the slightest bit of humanity in Tywin that wouldn't allow him to order his son to die.

Now, if you're all caught up in the show series then I'm just going to put a SPOILER warning here for season 6 episode titles ""Hold The Door."" 

My theory has to do with Bran Stark and why we actually saw the Mad King in his visions saying Burn Them All. We saw the impact of Bran Warging Hodor in a vision had, but what if it had a similar effect on the Mad King? The reason he was only able to repeat 1 phrase for hours, days even, is because of Bran trying to reach out in a vision of the past, AND IT WORKING! However it was never about just ""burning them all"" but Bran telling him to ""Bring them to the wall,"" and Bran talking about rallying all the troops and all the bannermen of westeros into 1 great army to fight the dead.

Personally, I thought her character development in Season 1 was great, starting off as a submissive sister that quickly realized his brother wasn't one to admire or follow when she finally saw the real world. She gained confidence throughout the season and made the most out of what initially could've been a shitty situation (basically being sold to Drogo). 

However, in Seasons 2-5 I thought her character development and her story in general were mediocre and frankly overrated at times, yes she had some good intentions to free the slaves and some really cool scenes but let's be honest most of the time she caught breaks, granted that's not her fault but the writing wasn't great imo, her story didn't feel as realistic as some others in the show.

What I had long been waiting for her character were scenes where she opened up, make her a more complex character, let us see what she's actually thinking behind closed doors, don't just give us this she's a badass and nothing more.  And we finally got those scenes in S6 and S7 mainly with Tyrion and Jon, even one with Varys. Her story in S7 is also a lot more realistic, because she finally loses a big part of her army, ships and a dragon, and finds herself in a tough spot of whether or not helping Jon would be the right decision. All of that while not making her character the ""good and perfect ruler"", they still gave us the burning the Tarlys scene to show us she has flaws, she can be impulsive, she's not perfect. So yeah that's why I thought her character development and story in general was much better in Season 7. 

One more thing I would like to add is I think a lot of people don't really quite get that she's not female Jon Snow, she is impulsive at times, doesn't always make the right decisions and she's not necessarily the hero, she's a different character, you don't have to compare her to Jon just because they're both around the same age.

Glaringly obvious (or not so obvious) foreshadowing, jokes or developments I missed the first time, character reactions to events, and the like. I've just reached S5E2 and the scene between Ellaria and Prince Doran just sent a wave of disgust all over me again. 


I honestly have no clue why Ellaria completely destabilized Dorne for unjust vengeance. I'm sure we can all agree that Oberyn's death was his own fault. Toying with his food before he ate it. And I can see why Ellaria could refuse to see it that way. I can also see why she would blame the Lannisters for his death. Oberyn was appointed to judge Tyrion's trial by Tywin. Strange. Tyrion then demands a trial by combat (surprise, surprise...) because of a particular lying whore. Then Cersei just so happens to choose the one man Oberyn sought after the most as her champion. So of course Oberyn would intercede on Tyrion's behalf. How could he pass up an opportunity to kill the Mountain and demand justice for his sister, niece, and nephew? In front of all of the important Lannisters and other high lords no doubt. So I can kind of see how she could maybe view it all as a grand manipulative plot for Oberyn's murder. 



However, I just can't justify how she went about exacting her revenge. I can't justify killing off your lovers family and ending the Martel name in order to start a war with the Lannisters. I'm like 99.9% sure that's not how Oberyn would want to be avenged. I also wonder about all of her fellow countrymen that she claimed also wanted revenge for Oberyn. Were they all backing her and the Sand Snakes? Were all of them down for that coup? And the murder of Myrcella and Trystane as well? 



The picture of Dorne that Oberyn painted for us before his demise is not the picture of Dorne that Ellaria left in her passion fueled tyrannical wake. And that's what confuses me the most. It doesn't seem like she did any of this to honor him. It barely feels like she really tried to avenge him because the only death she caused that would effect the Lannisters was Myrcella. And all that did was make her enemies more dangerous. And we all know how that came back around to bite her in the ass. 




So that's my take on Oberyn's paramore. I don't get her. At all. I just feel like she's kind of on Cersei's level being that she's not as clever as she thinks she is. I just hope there's somewhat of a resolution to this arc in this last season. But I'm doubtful because there's so much to resolve.

But thats not what winter does; it is the necessary death before new life (Spring). 

My theory goes that society and technology have stagnated; the world hasnt advanced much in the thousands of years of humanity, and society is rife with constant violence and instability with no end in sight. The White Walkers are meant to kill this sick world to allow for a new, better one to take its place, and to give humanity another shot. 

This information will reach Jon/Dany, who will then be faced with an impossible choice. Stop the White Walkers and save everyones lives but doom the world to a purgatory, or let them win sacrificing everyone to allow for a new better world to take its place.

834,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-9-12,2018,9,12,2,9ezhq5,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Azor Ahai and Lightbringer - my theory of the end finale,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9ezhq5/spoilers_azor_ahai_and_lightbringer_my_theory_of/,Logistics515,1536686248,"I originally published this theory well over a year ago and decided to revisit it and revise it after some time before the story picks up again. Curious on everyone's thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1 - Jon is Lightbringer

&amp;#x200B;

There are quite a few prophecies in A Song of Ice and Fire, but within the context of the TV show universe there are fewer that have received significant screen time and attention. One of the most major ones concern themselves with ""Azor Ahai"", ""The Prince Who Was Promised"", and the Sword ""Lightbringer"". It was this prophecy that Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was consumed with during his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Azor Ahai is a major figure in the religion of R'hllor, the Lord of Light - the same figure worshipped by the Red Priests/Priestesses, and primarily represented by the character Melisandre in the show. He was a legendary hero who fought in the last ""War of the Dawn"" which occurred during the events of the Long Night and the original invasion of Westeros by the White Walkers / Others and was pivotal in driving the invasion back. Per some of the books and sages in Asshai, Azor Ahai is due to be reborn per a prophecy of ""The Prince Who Was Promised"" and will stand against the White Walkers anew. Melisandre spends most of the time in GoT believing Stannis is that figure. Stannis's defeat and death in the North causes her to realize that her belief was wrong, and leads indirectly to Jon Snow's resurrection.

&amp;#x200B;

A major part of the Azor Ahai mythos is that he forged a powerful Sword known as ""Lightbringer"" that enabled his victory. This sword was attempted to be made 3 times - once by tempering in water, but the sword shattered. The second by tempering in the heart of a Lion, but again it shattered. The third by tempering it in the heart of his beloved wife (known as ""Nissa Nissa"" in the legend), which succeeds.

&amp;#x200B;

As has been noted in-universe and out, the Red Priests and Priestesses have access to a mystic source of information and power. Melisandre performs many feats, but she is ultimately incorrect about Stannis. She transfers (somewhat shakily) this idea of Azor Ahai reborn onto Jon Snow, but is clearly uncertain in her thoughts given her earlier misjudgement.

&amp;#x200B;

It's my contention (as well as others who have gone into far more detail on this and deserve far more credit) that the followers of R'hllor are looking at things in the incorrect manner, and it is leading them astray from figuring out the prophecy correctly - this is not terribly surprising, given that the story is well over 5000 years old at the time of the GoT books, so something was probably mangled in the centuries as the story was told and retold.

&amp;#x200B;

In an alternate take on things, the figure of 'Azor Ahai"", and the ""Prince Who Was Promised"" could be considered separate figures. This is apparently the conclusion that Rhaegar came to as well after he originally considered himself the 'Prince Who Was Promised' and instead concluded that it would be his son.

&amp;#x200B;

Under this reading, Azor Ahai reborn is Rhaegar Targaryen - the facts of his life align well with it - for instance, he was born amidst ""Salt and Smoke"" - which matches the Tragedy at Summerhall very well (a massive fire in one of the royal palaces, killing many of the royal line which also caused quite a bit of grief to the Realm as Aegon V Targaryen (i.e. ""Egg"" of the Dunk and Egg novels) was popular with the common folk). Rhaegar was born on the same day of the event.

&amp;#x200B;

But Azor Ahai still has to forge the sword Lightbringer. Instead of being a literal sword, take it as a metaphor for conception and childbirth. The sword Lightbringer was attempted to be forged three times, and only succeeded upon the last attempt, which also killed his wife. This aligns well with Rhaegar having 3 children - and not coincidentally, Jon kills his mother upon being born. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another interesting angle is the fact that Rhaegar during the course of his life made 3 predictions of who he thought Azor Ahai would be as he studied the prophecy. He first thought it would be himself, then revised that to his first son Aegon. Finally he concluded that he would need to have a 3rd child (""The Dragon has 3 heads""). 

&amp;#x200B;

Note how each of those deaths match up with the forging story of Lightbringer...

&amp;#x200B;

The 1st attempt to forge Lightbringer tempered it in water,  but it shattered and broke. Rhaegar died at the battle of the river Trident in combat with Robert Beratheon.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2nd attempt to forge the sword tempered it in the heart of a lion, but again it broke. Rhaegar's 1st son Aegon died at the sack of King's Landing during the closing days of Robert's Rebellion. The forces of House Lannister, which holds a Lion as their house sigil were most directly responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

The 3rd attempt to forge the sword succeeded. Jon was tempered through Lyanna who died when he was withdrawn.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 - The Ice Dragon changes the Game

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the defense of the Realm is shaping up to be a fortification against the Army of the Dead in the North. However, as more then one poster has noted, this has a glaring weakness - the Night King now has access to a Dragon, and is actively riding it. While this is a potent weapon all on it's own, it's not the true danger - what this does is give the Night King a greatly increased mobility. He has the ability to raise wights from the dead at any location. With the Dragon allowing him to effectively go anywhere he chooses he can easily bypass the Northern defenses and create new Armies of the Dead where he pleases, immediately outflanking our main characters. The only known strategic weakness the White Walkers have been shown to possess is the fact that any wights created by a given WW are destroyed upon their death. This leads to the end game.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 3 - The Last Stand

&amp;#x200B;

The Defense of the North will fall quickly due either to overwhelming numbers or defeat in detail due to being quickly surrounded by new dead armies created at will. The Army of the Living will need to retreat to the south to avoid being defeated entirely - and while the Dragonglass weapons provided by Jon's expedition to Dragonstone and the remaining Dragons may allow them to punch an effective hole through the Dead Army lines, it will be a temporary respite. They would need to fall back to a stronghold and force a confrontation with the Night King in order for any hope to remain - if he is killed, the entire wight army evaporates, and possibly the remaining White Walkers.

&amp;#x200B;

This stronghold is King's Landing - and this brings Cersei's plotting back to the forefront of the plot in order to bring the conclusion to fruition.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, King's Landing has a secret that very few people are privy to - it is mined extensively with Wildfire. I believe the end victory scenario involves Jon and Dany engaging the Night King with their Dragons to force a confrontation at King's Landing. There Jon now gets to somehow invoke his destiny as Lightbringer - and what would be a bigger ball of light then all of King's Landing going up all at once, with the Night King taken by surprise at the last second?",41,24,False,spoiler,,,,,

So, there's a lot of historical links people have notices between the Battle of the Bastards and the Battle of Waterloo: a tyrant (who isn't a ""real"" noble) defeated by a bunch of unusual allies under noble leadership, and the crucial arrival of cavalry at the right moments. 

If you've never seen it, it's worth watching--there's a glorious piece of absurdly-grand epic Soviet filmmaking just called ""Waterloo,"" and I had seen a clip of it the other day and noticed something.  There's a particular moment [when British heavy cavalry are crashing decisively into the battle](https://youtu.be/7vlcuvrM1po?t=3m47s).  Observe the flag-bearer right in the middle foreground.  [Remind you of anything?](https://youtu.be/qA81ewnPEFg?t=1m31s)  It's a really cool motif!  Given the kind of obvious parallels between the battles, and the influence of aforementioned piece of hilarious Soviet filmmaking on the creation of epic battle scenes, I would assume that this is a little homage.

BONUS EXAMPLE: Another one of these I had noticed a while ago: the [arrival of the elves at Helm's Deep](https://youtu.be/51BE_zrpyoU?t=48s) bears a lot of similarities, even down to the nasally sound of the horn's similarity to the bagpipe, of the [arrival of the Canadian allies](https://youtu.be/g1awwAgU_t8?t=3m3s) at the American base in ""Devil's Brigade.""",4,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

In S4E6 when they are at the council meeting Tywin orders an increase in The Hounds bounty from 50 silver stags to 100, when he was seen in the riverlands

There was also a handful of other times where 20-50 dragons were recognized as a heaping amount of wealth like when Tyrion pays Bron , or pays hookers etc etc.. Also when Davos pays his friend the Lysene pirate (I forget his name)

Anyways, 

There's 7 dwarves and the wedding which equals with simple math 20 dragons x 7 dwarves they give out 140 dragons for a small act/penniless bit  'albeit at Joffreys wedding' . 

And they paid that to them over the 50-100 Silver stag bounty set out for the hound, 

Also. Roose Bolten receives his wife's weight in silver and another the Hound steals a small bit of silver with Arya which is enough for them to survive

This looselessness with the gold dragons at joffreys wedding giving them what we are supposed to expect to be a shitload of gold is one of those annoying things that I think they didn't pay attention to ..

There are others but let me know what you think about this or if it is overlooking",4,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sansa was hated by so many people early on because of what happened to Ned even though she didn't deserve it.

Compared to other characters who at least had friends or people they could rely on, Sansa only ever had those in short bursts and had to go it alone most of the show.

The other 2 seem clearly built to repel the white walker threat, so why did Bran build Storm's End? My last piece of evidence comes the name of the castle itself, Storm's End.

Who is the actual smartest, most even handed strategic person left alive? Who would you put in charge of all of mans forces (if they could be united) to ensure the best chance for victory? 

My take in order of increasing usefulness as a leader...

Euron Greyjoy - Claim to fame, he took out the Sandsnakes with a sneaky sea maneuver. Downside, walkers fight on land. I rank him at the bottom, he'd feed his own troops to the NK and couldn't care about Westeros. I think he runs. 

Melisandre - helped win the War of the Five kings theoretically with magic. Walked Stannis into his doom also. I wouldn't trust her advice.

Cersei Lannister - She outmaneuvered the High Sparrow but also can't see the big picture. If everyone surrendered to her I don't think it would go that well. She lacks imagination to understand the threat. Most likely she ends up deep inside the castle ready to kill herself again. 

Varys - Either on purpose or not he has missed the boat on a lot of big intel (like Casterly Rock being empty) and I just can't trust him or his judgment.

Tyrion Lannister - Shined at the battle of blackwater bay Like the above, the meeting with Cersei is either bad judgment or worse. I haven't loved his military judgment this last season.

Jon Snow - fending off Mance Rayder's assault on Castle Black was epic but then the battle of the bastards would have been lost without Sansa. Jon has a good heart but a hot head and while he can be great on a battlefield but I don't know if he is cunning enough to outmaneuver an enemy like the NK. 

Daenerys Targaryen - Her dragons can turn the tide in most situations and she has had some incredible moments (outsmarting the Khals and burning them alive). But like Jon she can be hot headed and rush in without thinking. She can be manipulated fairly easily by her own people and others at times. She nearly got killed by Jamie rushing in herself. Putting herself above others (like Jon) and leading from the front isn't the best way to win a war. I can see her going out in a blaze of glory potentially.

Jorah Mormont - Even tempered, well trained and has a grasp for the situation and politics. His weakness is only Dany. He is a good knight but has a lack of experience in politics.

Bronn - He is a merc and cares about himself however he understands well if the NK wins they all lose. He may be prone to cut and run but he has the right temperament for victory and leading in a war. He also plays the game fairly well. But he might not have enough loyalty and doesn't care too much for the realm or the people in it. 

Davos Seaworth - not a fighter but cunning and smart. A valuable leader and could be an asset if he was actually listened to by the ones he worked for. I just don't know if he has the ruthlessness needed to win if he were leading on his own. He needs to be paired with someone who has aggression.

Theon Greyjoy - His early exploits are embarrassing but he has been forged into something better. Trained by Ned at warfare, courage was his missing ingredient. He may have found it. He hasn't proven anything in battle...yet. But he might finally ""get"" it. He now has empathy but also a violent streak in him which is the combination required. 

Jaime Lannister - After all he's been through, he's the best military commander standing who actually understands the stakes. His lone weakness, his sister, might be in the rear view mirror. He lost his hand but he gained perspective. The one thing he lacks is a true desire to be a king, he doesn't really crave power for himself and you need someone who understands the game of thrones. He is almost going down the Ned road, a little too naive to manage the kingdom and keep the alliance needed to win.

Sansa Stark - zero military experience but is smart enough to outsource it. Sansa learned to LISTEN. She is actually my pick for the best standing leader. She isn't stubborn and has humility now, its been beaten into her. She has a thorough grasp of the dangers of situations and politics. She is ruthless (Battle of the Bastards) and cunning (Battle of the Bastards) but also has a mind for things like resources and how things look to other lords. All the abuse forged a solid well balanced leader and not a monster in this case. She lacks military experience but would be smart enough to actually listen to people like Davos and Jorah not minimize them as Jon, Dany and Stannis had. She would see through Varys types now and use someone like Jamie for all he was worth while making sure he didn't get too powerful. I think she can run the ship, the whole ship and would be their best bet at managing to a victory. 

Anyway that's just my pick, I am sure most would disagree but therein lies the fun...",76,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've heard a theory recently and, although I don't fully believe it, I find it interesting and I decided to share it with you. 

I have seen a video recently where it was discussed the possibility of ""Planetos"" being a post-apocalyptic world. According to the theory, the planet used to be occupied by a very advanced civilisation before the Long Night. Be it a highly technological civilisation or a magical one is besides the point. The issue is that there are some constructions in Westeros that defy the current technological capabilities of their civilisation:

* Storm's End - a castle surrounded by a massive wall with incredibly smooth walls and stones the fit together perfectly that, although it is thousands of years old **and** built right next to the ocean, shows little to no signs of wear and degradation.
* Winterfell - one of the largest castles on the continent, with a very large system of subterranean tunnels.
* The Wall - an ice structure, almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower. 

All these structures, as well as the technological advancements of the Valyrians, are clearly far beyond the technical abilities they are currently capable of. The current GoT civilisations simply cannot reproduce those buildings. According to the theory, there was a major conflict or natural calamity that forced them to regress technologically. Also, since there seems to be little progress in the last 8 millennia and they're stuck in an early medieval society , they probably no longer have the means to rediscover and rebuild what was lost.

This could also explain their wonky climate. Maybe whatever tragedy destroyed the previously advanced cultures screwed up the planet's axial tilt (or even the orbit), which would result in extreme temperature variations and abnormally long seasons.",37,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Is this what they truly want?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9fmy11/i_noticed_something_strange_about_the_white/,MyRoomWithAView,1536881060,"This is not a very fleshed out theory at all, but I just realized something very weird about the White Walkers. There seem to be hardly people who ever get away from them unscathed. The only ones I can think of right now are Sam Tarly (after being seperated from the others after the fight at the fist of the first men, I think S2E10) and the Ranger we get to meet in the very beginning of the series, who is later beheaded by Ned.
For all others an encounter with the WWs seems to end with a fight to the death. Plus, by controlling the wights the WWs have literally killed thousands of innocent people. Strong and fierce warriors, but also women and children. Young people and old people. Good people and bad people. The WWs don't discriminate.

So why were Sam and the Ranger spared? What makes them different, what did they have that all the others didn't?
In my opinion, they were spared because they surrendered. They did not even attempt to take up arms and defend their lives. They didn't scream for help or tired to run. They simply accepted their fates and waited to die. 
The Ranger in season one just drops to his knees in fear and resignation upon whitnessing the death of his comrade. Sam also just cowers on the ground, completely paralyzed by fear.
Both of them recognized and accepted the superiority of their opponent and prepared to die. And that's why they didn't.

So my conclusion is that the WWs don't really want to exterminate humanity, what they truly want is subordination. They literally want you to KNEEL. I've always liked the idea of the WWs being intelligent beings and having their own agenda apart from killing everything and everyone in sight. This also seems much more in line with the story of their creation. The children of the forest seem to be quite peaceful in principle, and it wouldn't make sense for them to create a mindless killing machine. They just needed some sort of power to keep the first men in check and preserve their environment. I don't think that ending as many lives as possible was ever their intention.

Another thing that made me sure that it's subordination and obedience that the WWs want is when I thought about the time when Sam killed the WW while protecting Gilly and the baby. Why wasn't he spared then? He's still the same person, nothing really changed... nothing except his attitude. This time he found his courage, he was angry, he was ready to fight and kill! All the things the WWs don't like to see. And that's why it had to end with death, either for the WW or for Sam, Gilly and the baby.

By extention, you could also say that Craster had his own way of being obedient to the WWs. By sacrificing his sons and living WITH the WWs rather than against them, he ensured his own safety.

Anyways, as I said, this is not a well thought out theory. It's just something I noticed, found really exciting and wanted to share with you. What do you think, does this sound plausible? ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Strong and fierce warriors, but also women and children. Young people and old people. Good people and bad people. The WWs don't discriminate.

So why were Sam and the Ranger spared? What makes them different, what did they have that all the others didn't?
In my opinion, they were spared because they surrendered. They did not even attempt to take up arms and defend their lives. They didn't scream for help or tired to run. They simply accepted their fates and waited to die. 
The Ranger in season one just drops to his knees in fear and resignation upon whitnessing the death of his comrade. Sam also just cowers on the ground, completely paralyzed by fear.
Both of them recognized and accepted the superiority of their opponent and prepared to die. And that's why they didn't.

So my conclusion is that the WWs don't really want to exterminate humanity, what they truly want is subordination. They literally want you to KNEEL. I've always liked the idea of the WWs being intelligent beings and having their own agenda apart from killing everything and everyone in sight. This also seems much more in line with the story of their creation. The children of the forest seem to be quite peaceful in principle, and it wouldn't make sense for them to create a mindless killing machine. They just needed some sort of power to keep the first men in check and preserve their environment. I don't think that ending as many lives as possible was ever their intention.

Another thing that made me sure that it's subordination and obedience that the WWs want is when I thought about the time when Sam killed the WW while protecting Gilly and the baby. Why wasn't he spared then? He's still the same person, nothing really changed... nothing except his attitude. This time he found his courage, he was angry, he was ready to fight and kill! All the things the WWs don't like to see. And that's why it had to end with death, either for the WW or for Sam, Gilly and the baby.

By extention, you could also say that Craster had his own way of being obedient to the WWs. By sacrificing his sons and living WITH the WWs rather than against them, he ensured his own safety.

Anyways, as I said, this is not a well thought out theory. It's just something I noticed, found really exciting and wanted to share with you. What do you think, does this sound plausible? ",23,48,False,spoiler,,,,,

Everyone has been throwing out ideas on where the people of asoiaf will end up so here is my kick of the can. Don't really have a lot of evidence its more of a gut feeling.

Dany: a lot of people seem to agree (me as well) that by the end of the show dany will end up dead. Maybe in a dragon accedent? Maybe before the attack of the night king (or after the nk destroys winterfell) she goes to kings landing and destroys the red keep she dies when someone shoots down her dragon?

Tyrion: i believe that tyrion will end up as the lord of casterly rock. It will probably be given to him or he will ask for it after the nightking is defeated. I think this because he has always seemed to want the rock: he asked it from tywin in kings landing (cant remember the episode) and he convinced dany to launch an attack on it. 

Jon: i believe Jon will not take the Iron Thron after he defeats the nk but he will go to the north and rule. After all is said and done i believe john will get rid of the ""seven kingdoms"" and just sepperate it into two (maybe three depending on what dorne does) with the north being one and the south being another. I think this because jon has been raised as a stark and in the show it has been mentioned a few timed that starks dont fair well in the south (ned, rob, neds father and older brother (cant remember there names)) meaning that maybe the writers are sutibly telling audiences that starks won't rule the south? So because dany is dead and I dont think jon will become king in the south he will put a ruler on the Iron Throne, which brings me to......

Gendry: In my expert (not really) oppinion i think jon will put gendry on the throne. Here is my thoughts: Jon is a very honerable person so i think that since Robbert won the cival war by right of conquest a Berathion should sit on the throne. I think jon would do this because ned and robbert were good friends and that would also provide an ""underdog"" situaltion as gendrys mother is a prostitute. And since all of the pure blooded ones are dead so he goes with the next best thing! (Im most hopeing for this one)

Sansa: as for sansa i think she will be do one of three things 
Option A: she will stay in the north and help rebuild the north
Option 2: maybe since jon will sepperate the kingdoms he will introduce Gendry to sansa in the hopes that they will hit it off? (Bonus because this garentees that there will be no fighting between the kingdomes for the forseeable future
Option three: she dies when the nightking destroys winterfell
(Of all of the characters this is the one im least confedent in being right)


So thoes are my ideas!! Again most of these are just my brain saying ""what about this!!""

1030,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-9-14,2018,9,14,22,9fs4ms,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] - Varys and Littlefinger - The Players,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9fs4ms/spoilers_varys_and_littlefinger_the_players/,Caesar3890,1536932794,"Recently there are a lot of posts regarding these two, a lot of people annoyed at LF's death or how the two haven't bene important since book material ran out. Also some who think Littlefinger is a faceless man or something and faked his own death, which is just plain awful story telling and I just want to say my piece on some of the perceived issues on the show. 

First off let's talk about the streamlined story lines and quick appearances these two have made in the last season. Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, Jamie, Brienne, Cersei, Theon, Yara, Euron, Sam, Jorah, Bran, Night King that's a quick nod of the top of my head to characters who out rank Varys and LF as main characters, just look at the amount of them and how many story lines and different things that had to be attempted to be tied up, it's a staggering amount. Never mind any one I have missed or any other storylines that are still going, I hadn't even mentioned the Hound, the Brotherhood or Gendry, and whether we like it or not this show was to end in 7 series and instead they producers went with 8 seasons, see if we take away the notion that this is season 8 and more of a season 7 part two therefore we got 2 smaller seasons of 13 episodes opposed to 1 series of 10 episodes. So with limited time left there are a remarkable amount of storylines to still be covered unfortunately someone has to miss out. The writing in S7 was rushed and not as good as other seasons also that cannot be hid from but some of the remarks that users make about DnD are just plain stupid, DnD clearly realised the rushed writing in S7 and that is why the new season took almost a full year to film and will not be released for another 7 months at best. 

* The characters had less influence or had nothing to do - well Varys secured an alliance between the Reach, Dorne and Dany while also leading Tyrion to her. The man has also lost all his little birds in KL and presumably a good chunk of his birds in Westeros in general if no one is there to watch them. In the book GRRM has Varys at the head of Aegon's campaign to take Westeros so with the omission of Aegon it was always going to be hard to write Varys storyline perfect in what little time they had left. As for LF since S5 he had successfully harboured a criminal against the crown, used her to broker a marriage with the North, took control of the Veil all under Queen Cersei's nose and until the Battle of the Bastards where is men saved the day she thought he was on her side. His only mistake in those years was not doing his research on Ramsey but then again why would the Lord of the Vale worry about some bastard, even Roose underestimated him. 

One thing I will say in the defence of DnD is that the author can't even get to the next part of this complex story never mind two guys who were adapting it, GRRM can't even give us the penultimate book and DnD have to finish it within time limits, I'm sure if they had 5 years or more to make the last series it would be brilliant, and I for one think they have done a very good job at a very hard task.  

* Littlefinger's death (or lack thereof) - ""he was used to make a death quota"" ""no way he would be outsmarted by Sansa"" ""he would have ran away if he thought there was trouble"" ""how did he think Sansa and Arya wouldn't trust each other"" - all complaints made, all with no water behind them if you ask me. Littlefinger was always going to die this year or early next year, the second the Night King broke past the wall LF scheming and plans became redundant, the NK does not take prisoners and cannot be bargained with. 

I have explored many subs for many years and the feeling always was that earlier in the series Sansa would learn from those around her, learn from LF and would out Littlefinger, Littlefinger to his death, yet people act surprised that she did that. Even though Sansa was only able to do it with the help of Bran. 

On running away, where would he go? Sit in the Eyyrie with Robyn and hope it all goes away? The Vale were fully invested in the great war that is to come and they knew that the NK was real and there was no chance in hell Lord Royce and the other nights were leaving with him regardless of what they may say, also sneaking away is one thing, sneaking away with 10,000 horses is another. 

Why did he try to pit Sansa and Arya vs each other? Because he made the same mistake that Rhaegar made, Jamie made, maybe even the Mad King made with Joanna he fell in love. No matter how calculated and cool everyone likes to think LF is he still loved Cat and when she died that love moved to Sansa, he had ideas of them ruling and thought that Sansa had become so alienated with life that she only loved LF. He totally over estimated her love for him just like he did with Cat when he was younger. This made him cocky and complacent and it cost him his life in the end. He died as he deserved to die on his knees, the man responsible for so much hurt and pain and death who wouldn't dare pick up a sword or fight honourably died the way he lived.

Oh and LF is not a faceless man dressed up, Faceless men aren't like cars that you can just rent, they require riches to purchase and not just money. Even in S1 LF highlights the expense of the FM, also it would be really stupid that Bran can see everything about LF and totally happens to miss the part he got a Faceless man to kill himself and swap places. 

We still have to hear what Varys heard in the flames but as Mel said he will die. The same episode Mel said that to Varys Bran also said ""Chaos is a Ladder"" to Bran, this was a nod that things aren't the same any more, secrets, rumours, schemes, betrayal none of it matters now there are bigger powers at work now, the 3 eyed raven, the Lord of Light if he is out there and the Night King are ready to come to their conclusion and the only ones who will survive the Long night are those who either fight to save themselves or stay in their pack. These two are very much lone wolves and as Ned said the lone wolf dies but the pack survives. The Long Night is here and the game is over, the players are redundant and there is nowhere to hide.

It may still feel like an age away, but before long GoT will have delivered its final season and we will find ourselves in the eternal lot of reddit boards which outlast their inspiration. There will be an expanded universe to enjoy but this is it, one more brief season and well know the answer to all the questions. We will have a conclusion. It will be filed in the history books and compared to everything from The Sporanos to Lord of the Rings, it will be measured, critically evaluated and then we can begin to forever disagree over the fine detail. So I pose 5 key questions or areas of discussion. The chips have fallen for the Baelishs and *The* Marjories of the world of Westeros but how these 5 areas are concluded will have a massive bearing on how much or less we love the final season, and the whole. 

1.	Can Cersei be redeemed?
2.	Will Bran play jazz with history?
3.	Can Jon Snow survive the Night King?
4.	Warden of the North?/Lord Commander of the Nightswatch?
5.	Cleganebowl?

Yes Jamie/Sandor/Theon are on near death experience personality transplant comeback tours and Dany has promised an Iron Throne forever and a day and there are countless other plot points that demand resolution but the 5 listed are conversations weve been having for years, and heres why theyre still as important as ever.

1.	Cersei Lannister was last seen turning KL into an Ivory Tower, with clear plans to turn her back on a Northern Alliance in favour of continuing to act completely irrationally in the face of undeniable evidence. Jamie leaves last, a symbolic gesture. Cerseis obsession over her Mother being taken from her by her baby brother Tyrion would be amplied by the loss of Joffrey, Mycella and Tommen where she couldnt control the first, wasnt allowed the control the second and had all the control in the world over the third. Their father has now left and she is alone. Ive heard internet speculation about what could happen with her child but there needs to be a contrast between Dany and Cersei for this. If the central theme of only death can pay for life Is true then this is where it will deliver its final stroke in the story. Will Cersei lose her child before its born? Will it die in childbirth? Will Cersei die in childbirth knowing the love her mother felt for Tyrion, finally finding peace with that? Her isolation has to play a role, but what? Will the NK get to her and take her as his Queen? What will happen to her baby?

2.	Bran Stark, kids an enigma. His climbing accident at the end of the first episode of the first season pointed Bran out as someone whos story needs a satisfying conclusion for the story to have one, and to this point nobody could have predicted the path that has turned his from Dennis the Menace into Neo. He broke Hodor (and created Hodor) but in so doing he proved that its dangerous to meddle with history, but it is possible and it can be useful. In fairness they did survive the cave invasion of season six. Yes the realisation of what Hodor means was poignant but at the same time it proved Bran must have more tricks up his sleeve. Will he use his psychic link with Hodor to infiltrate the Army of the Dead hivemind and destroy them from the core like a computer virus? Will he make the mad king go mad? Will he use the ability to find out information valuable in the war? When Ned said When we see eachother again, well talk about your mother like he was about to cry to Jon was that him really saying weve already had this conversation, you just havent yet.? Can Bran do that? What would be a satisfying use of Brans abilities in the final season besides personality contests? What would justify all the training and ultimately how will he exist in the world after the war is over? Will he become a tree too?

3.	Jon Snow and the Night King have this mad tension, its something like sexual energy, just edgier... They dont fight as much as flirt and the Night King did not respond well when Jons girlfriend showed up to pick him and his mates up from a party the Nights King has laid on specially for him. They dress the same, both prefer the Northern climate and have been on a collision course since they first locked eyes. Any satisfying conclusion of this story needs a fight or a situation where one destroys the other. It would be a shock if the Night King won but is Jons fate tied to his nemesis? Hes had mini-bosses along the way but if this was a video game then Jon should resolve this in the final season. But how, and will he have to die in order to cancel out his nemesis? What will happen to Jon Snow? If this is indeed bittersweet then surely hes on our list of maybe fallers, no?

4.	There are a few important positions that need to be filled when this story comes to a conclusion. Will there be a need for a Nightswatch anymore and who will lead if there is... Will Arya and Bran maybe? Does no wall mean no Nightswatch? And what of Winterfell, which of the Starks will take the family seat when this is done? I havent mentioned the Iron Throne because its very likely it wont matter when this story comes to a conclusion. The destruction which the Night King will rain down will bring into stark contrast (no pun intended) the pointlessness of regional rivalries. Its the living against the dead. There will however be some kind of structure in place. Will Theon return to the Iron Islands? Will we see the complete demise of more houses, if so who... Lannisters Im looking at you. In order for the final season to work there needs to be a connection continued with some of these roles. Will House Baratheon, a house rooted in the first season, see its restoration under Gendry? What was it RB said, make my son a better man than I am Ned, something like that. Who do we want to see in these positions? How will it happen, and why?

5.	I literally downloaded a foghorn app on my phone in anticipation of this before season 7. Think I still have, guaranteed to still have it come the start of season 8. It shouldnt be as big a deal. Its been brought up precious little over the series, in many ways the narrative points to Arya as being so much more crucial than either of the Clegane boys, but when I think about how its going to make me feel to see them fight its like Im Ric Flair at a Wooing Festival #timeofmylife... Its something which the anticipation of may overshadow but its a TV event nobody will want to miss. How will this play out, will Arya get involved? Will it be an official or unsanctioned fight? Where will it take place? Do we have any concrete clues for how the Hound will defeat him? Is it something which could kill the Hound, or mortally wound him long enough to witness Arya kill the Mountain. Will Arya get many more names off her list? Is she over the whole list thing now shes avenged the red wedding?




That is the tip of the iceberg, but enough conversation points to get the weekend started. Any and all opinions welcome, debates over the direction the show has taken welcome, book fans welcome, show only fans welcome... How will this reach a satisfying conclusion... Personally, and not for nothing, but I want to see Gendry with Davos by his side, sitting on the throne in Kings Landing. I wont see that happen but that the beauty of this, there are a million permutations still to play out, so feel free to discuss. 

What is dead may never die.

Am i the only one who didnt realize it straight away.

Everytime i tried to think about who did it id always come up with tywin ir varys 

My reason for suspecting both tywin amd varys was that joffory was getting further out of control both would have rather had the docile tommen on the throne

But later on after i a while i figured that varys couldnt have done it cause he need the realm to be in chaos and then danny would have swooped in like a white knight on a dragon to save the kingdom.



So it never occured it was olenna but now that i think it. The evidence was there it was incriminating but it was still there. The scene where olenna and margery ask Sansa about joffory was prove enough no grandmother would want her grandaughter married to that monster but why didmt she ask the servants or ask the spies because the tyrells obvs had to have spies each house needs them in court to survive",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Am i the only one who didnt realize it straight away.

Everytime i tried to think about who did it id always come up with tywin ir varys 

My reason for suspecting both tywin amd varys was that joffory was getting further out of control both would have rather had the docile tommen on the throne

But later on after i a while i figured that varys couldnt have done it cause he need the realm to be in chaos and then danny would have swooped in like a white knight on a dragon to save the kingdom.



So it never occured it was olenna but now that i think it. The evidence was there it was incriminating but it was still there. The scene where olenna and margery ask Sansa about joffory was prove enough no grandmother would want her grandaughter married to that monster but why didmt she ask the servants or ask the spies because the tyrells obvs had to have spies each house needs them in court to survive",17,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

hey, folks , there might actually be a hidden easter egg when arya, gendry and hot pie encountered the brotherhood without banners for the first time.

here, check the below link for that video in season 3 episode 2

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZH3lWhUHTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZH3lWhUHTI)

in that scene(at 1:17), when the brotherhood shoots an arrow at arya's hiding place, thoros makes an interesting comment.

Thoros of Myr: \[Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie have been cornered by the Brotherhood Without Banners\] *What's lurking behind that wall?* ***A lion?*** *A wolf?*  
Anguy: *Just a dirty little cub, I think.*

see, this thoros of myr is a red priest like melisandre, who has some magical abilities attributed to him, in both books and show.

he refers to arya as a wolf( makes sense since arya is a stark), dirty little cub may fit for hot pie, and more importantly he referred to gendry as ""***a lion""***.

why did he use this word to refer to gendry??

the way i see it, this is another indication that gendry is actually the son of cersei and he is a lannister.

too many coincidences happening for this theory and more and more youtubers like tony teflon, are saying that gendry is actually son of cersei. see this video for more info

So, my impression is, we're going to get the entirety of the explanation for what is going on in GoT in the prequel series only. - Because, so far, the story, as effectful and eye-pleasing as it is, doesn't make much sense until now.

I wrote a longer version of this question a while ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6x2v4w/spoilers\_extended\_so\_what\_is\_gots\_actual\_main/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6x2v4w/spoilers_extended_so_what_is_gots_actual_main/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In the books, things, IIRC, pointed towards a Blackfyre conspiracy: Varys IIRC is suspected to be a Blackfyre, as are the Tattered Prince and a couple of other Essos-based characters; the Three-Eyed Crow, who is suspected to be Bloodraven, as well as fAegon even have their own, expanding plotlines. Jon could be one, for all we know. - And, most importantly, of course, the plot concerning the Others still needs to be explained on a fundamental level - even if we can perhaps assume that the Long Night/Battle of the Dawn 2.0 will also mark the end of the book series.  
&gt;  
&gt;(My personal, uneducated bet is, it will somehow be revealed that the Doom of Valyria somehow triggered the return of the Others, and that the Targs have been fighting them, each their own way, for quite a while - maybe that R+L=J even was a conscious breeding effort to create The Prince That Was Promised.)  
&gt;  
&gt;But now, to the show: No Blackfyres, and given that GRRM has apparently vetoed a ""Dunk &amp; Egg"" spin-off, we might perhaps not see any of that, at all. So, could it be that we have seen the basic explanations for everything that's been going on already?  
&gt;  
&gt;To begin with, the Children of the Forest had an epic fail in their Spellcheck roll for the magic they used to create the Night's King, and pacted with the First Men to defeat him, if only temporarily. The NK then either spent the next 9.000 years either asleep, or waiting for a particular event that hopefully is still to be explained, in or around the place of his original bewitchment, South of Hardhome, but North of Eastwatch, until he decided to reveal himself for unknown reasons. (So plot, much sense.)  
&gt;  
&gt;In more present times, the downfall of the Targs was triggered by Rhaegar eloping with Lyanna Stark, instead of, frankly, doing literally anything else that would have made more sense in that situation. And because his daddy had been a dick as a ruler, his subjects chose to rebel.  
&gt;  
&gt;And now, as the action now unravels for season 8, we are gearing up for a second siege of Winterfell, with strong hints being given that salvation against the White Walkers might lie in the dungeons of the castle, if not already being (partially) present in the form of the Catspaw dagger. (Again, IMHO, stretching the boundaries of logic and coherency to a limit, despite the show's generally pretty good storytelling.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, timetravel is possible, and, because of that, virtually everything, from Bran warging into the Mad King, to time being a flat circle (Bran also being Brandon the Builder).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to add: So, Craster supplies the NK with babies that he then turns into White Walkers. Is Craster THE ONLY PERSON in 9.000 years, though, to leave a babe unattended while North of the Wall? Couldn't the NK have obtained more babies in quicker ways?

\---

What is your take on this, after all? - I like the fancy pictures the series provides its audiences with, but, so far, I am not seeing any logic in the events of the last few seasons. It's basically ""The Walking Dead"" with medieval people now. ...Or am I missing something integral?

Thank you,

Rafe",6,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Before I go into the scene in S1E3, I want to briefly skip ahead to [this scene in S1E5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8ES_ElI6Wg&amp;t=1m14s) where Cersei and King Robert have a conversation that turns surprisingly deep. It's one of the best written original (not in books) scenes in the whole show. Cersei and Robert talk about a few things, including Lyanna Stark. 
&gt; **Cersei**: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us?

&gt; **Robert**: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted. Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.  

I love Robert's dialogue in this scene so much that I've practically memorized it by now. It shows a vulnerable side of Robert that we never see at any other time in his brief appearance on the show. 


OK, going back to S1E3. During [the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6GW03WsFgU) where Robert, Ser Barristan, and Jaime discuss the first time they killed someone, the opening line is from Robert. It's a line that I must have heard dozens of times, but I had to pause the episode immediately last night because I finally, truly, *heard* it. 
&gt; (in regards to killing people in War)

&gt; **Robert**: It's been a long time, **but I still remember every face**. 

So King Robert, the man who went to war to win back the woman of his dreams, the woman he loved, the woman who he labeled as ""the one thing I ever wanted"", does not remember her face, but remembers all the faces of the men he's killed in battle. 

I always assumed Robert's anger towards Targaryens was because of his immense love for Lyanna. Now, I think I was wrong. Did Robert love Lyanna? Yes, I think he did. I think he thought she was the most beautiful girl he ever saw, and he was so excited that she was going to be his wife. But then Robert's life was turned upside down. His love for her, after he learned of her ""rape and murder"", turned to hatred for the people who prevented that love from carrying on. And so with this new information of Robert's facial memory, I now firmly believe the amount of love he had for Lyanna does not even come close to the amount of hatred he had for Rhaegar and all Targaryens. That is where the real passion is. In hatred, in anger, **in violence**. All positivity in his life was replace with intense negativity. 

This is why he remembers the faces of the ones he's killed, but not the face of one he loved.

**TLDR:** Robert remembers every face of every man he's killed, but doesn't remember the face of Lyanna Stark, the woman he loved more than anything in the world. This is because the hatred in his heart severely outweighs his love for her. ",244,3581,False,spoiler,,,,,

Welcome to the second week of Andreas favorite characters in the Game of Thrones. There are a couple of changes from the last week based on the feedback I received from the first week's list, I find that changes are in order going forward. The first change is the title. Last week, the title indicated power rankings instead of favorites. ""Andreas favorites"" is more accurate in describing what is being listed here than power rankings. Despite the title change, the goal remains the same, to be number one!  The second change is the order that list is presented. Last week I counted down and this week I count up. I have decided that many  dont want to read the entire list to see who is number one, they want the answer now! So, without any further ado, lets get started.

&amp;#x200B;

This week's episode:  The Kingsroad

**1. Arya Stark (Last week 1)**

Despite having a rough week with losing her dire wolf and her friend, Arya proves she is an awesome character by maintaining her grip on the number one spot on this list. Her spunk continues to shine as she accuses the Prince of being a liar in front of the King. Not only is Arya going to amount to something, she is going get her revenge for the events that occurred this week!

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Daenerys Targaryen (Last week 2)**

Andreas prediction for Daenerys involves gaining more power. The question is, will the Daenerys gain in power improve her coolness enough to bump her up to the number one spot in the coming weeks. Maybe, but for now she holds on to the number two spot.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Brandon Stark (Last week 3)**

The top three spots in the list remain the same. Brandon didnt get a lot of screen time this episode. He was unconscious most of the episode and woke up at the end. Apparently, that is enough to keep hold of his spot at number three. Having the last scene of the episode, makes Andrea believe that hes going to amount to something.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Catelyn Stark (Last week 5)**

Our first mover of the week is Catelyn Stark, moving up one spot to the number four position.  The main reason that she has moved up is because she is showing more spunk.   She fought off a would be attacker and stood vigil over Bran for weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Ned Stark (Last week 4)**

Lord Eddard Stark drops one position this week. Hes going to hold the king in lessor favor after the incident on the kings road. Andrea doesnt think that Ned has the cojones to do anything about the traitor in the midst (Cersei Lannister).  

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Dire Wolves (Last week - not ranked)**

The dire wolves get ranked this week. They are ranked as a pack because they are spiritually connected somehow. Bran is in the loop too.  Having one run away after saving the day on the Kings road, and having another save Bran and Catelyn has shown that these animals deserve a favorable ranking. So, they fall in at number six. The news isnt all happy though, we morn the loss of poor Lady. She didnt do anything! Lady is good. Unfortunately, being good, doesnt save you in the Game of Thrones.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Jon Snow (Last week - not ranked)**

Welcome to the list Jon Snow!  Youre just a poor doofus that is going to try to do your best. This is an admirable trait, and lands you at the number seven spot. We wish you luck in finding out who your mother is. 

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Sansa Stark (Last week 6)**

Dropping two spots this week to make some room for the new comers to the list is Sansa Stark.   There is a lot of flip flopping going on with Sansa. One moment you kind of like her, the next you think shes an idiot. Its a lot like Mean Girls. She want the boy, but knows she cant have her sister executed.  Wait, what?   

&amp;#x200B;

**9.  Khal Drogo (Last week 11)**

Moving up in the world, Khal Drogo is getting less bad. Hes getting a little bit smitten with his wife. But, hes going to lose control of his khalasar to her. After all, hes just a dumb animal. Drogo is still firmly on the dislike side of the list, but hes moving up. Last week, there was only Viserys Targaryen who was despised more than Drago. This week, the khal has moved up to an almost neutral zone.  If he keeps moving up, he may even be liked in the not too distant future.  Go Drogo!

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Robert Baratheon (Last week 9)**

Dropping a spot to number 10 this week, Robert is even more unliked.  Last week, the thought was that he was just going to keep f@#king, drinking, and being an annoying character. But, this week he showed he was pretty spineless too.  Hes going to learn that his wife is a traitorous bitch, but, he will not do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Joffrey Baratheon (Last week - not ranked)**

Last week Joffrey didnt warrant getting ranked. He was mentioned, but he seemed like too small of a character. This week, hes a no lipped blonde piece of sh#t. The hope for Joffrey is that he will get his throat ripped out by one of the dire wolves. Apparently, just biting his arm wasnt enough cruelty to inflict on Joffrey.  He deserves much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

**12. Viserys Targaryen (Last week 12)**

Taking a week off this week, Viserys moved no closer to the number one spot. However, he did move out of the basement because more characters were ranked this week.  Viserys is still a creepy bother but he no longer holds the most hated character at this point, but there is a character hated more than him.

&amp;#x200B;

**13. Cersei Lannister (Last week 8)**

The most hated character award goes to Cersei Lannister.  She drops five spots to land down in the basement.  Being a traitorous bitch can do that to a character.  Last week, it was thought that Cersei and Jamie were going to cause trouble. Who knew that Cersei didnt need Jamie to cause trouble. She can do that all on her own. It is pretty bad when you encourage killing off a beloved dire wolf.  But, this is only the beginning. She is going to cause a lot more mayhem before anything will happen to her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There you have it.  The second weeks character rankings. These rankings and predictions are made from a person who has only seen through episode 2 of season 1 (The Kingsroad). Its interesting to see how accurate (or inaccurate) the predictions are.  Also, its fun to guess if the predictions are going to change.  Where did your favorite character land?  Who do you think is going to move up next week? Who is going to move down?  Check back next week to find out.

&amp;#x200B;

As a bonus:

Not ranked this week:

Jamie Lannister (Last week 7) and Tyrion Lannister (Last week 10) were not ranked this week. Im sure they will come back in the coming weeks though.

&amp;#x200B;

The **DEAD** characters:

2. Mica: Mica was just fonder on the side. Poor guy.",2,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

The ""chain"" and ""hands of gold"" in the song is about [the golden chain of linked hands the hand of the king wears](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e7/Tyrion_Blackwater_Promo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120529033629). So golden hands refers to Tyrion's chain. However, Jaime also has a golden hand. They are both valonqars (little brothers) to Cersei as Cersei was born before Jaime and much before Tyrion. For those who aren't keen on the prophecy as the show tweaked it: the valonqar (high valyrian for little brother) is said to wrap his hands around Cersei's throat and choke the life from her.

[Going to the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOneWHLaPQ). Ed Sheeran sings most of the song until the refrain where all the men begin singing:

""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm.""

""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are...**"" and they stop to look at Arya. Arya concludes the scene with ""I'm going to kill the queen.""

Arya is the valonqar.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was asking myself if Jon snow would have blood of the dragon like dany. Would fire hurt him? 

Re-watching season 1 I answered my own question. 
In episode 8 of season 1 The Pointy End, about midway through the episode, Jon encounters his first white walker. When the lord commander enters the scene with a lantern, Jon grabs it and throws it at the white walker. When he does this he burns his hand and cries out in pain. 

So he obviously does not have blood of the dragon, unless the director didnt know Jons lineage prior to filming this and it was an error. 

Some questions for our lore experts: if Jon doesnt have the blood of a dragon.... why? What dictates this ability? (Jon and viserys both lacking but both Targaryen) 

Or was it an error during filming as stated above? 

What do you think? ",23,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Over  some time reading on this Reddit, I've run across more then my fair  share of hostility to Rhaegar Targaryen due to his actions prior to the  story starting, and particularly due to his choices in regards to Lyanna  Stark and the resulting civil war that engulfed the Realm. I thought it  would be a good idea to lay out my case for the opposite interpretation  - that he's the hero of the story who did his duty at the cost of his  life.

Rhaegar  was born on the same day of a major catastrophe - the ""Tragedy at  Summerhall"". This was the Targaryen's summer palace, which burnt to the  ground killing a large portion of the royal family and important people -  for instance Sir Duncan the Tall and Aegon V Targaryen...the two  characters we see prominently in the ""Dunk and Egg"" novels. Now during  the course of those novels, ""Egg"" gets an unusual education in the  workings of the Realm while traveling with Duncan - he gets to see much  of the gritty reality of the common folk, and this naturally carried  over into his rule once he found himself on the Throne against all  expectations (He was also known as ""Aegon the Unlikely"" due to the sheer  number of people who were in line of succession before him.) Aegon V  insituted a large number of progressive reforms that weakened the power  of the nobility and gave common people considerably more options in  life. This naturally earned him a number of enemies. He concluded that  his reforms would stand no chance of long term success unless he could  rebuild the power base of the Targaryens of old - i.e. Dragons. He  procured a number of eggs somehow and was attempting a ritual to hatch  them when the ""tragedy"" occurred. Its speculated that the fire that  resulted was no accident and was a deliberate assassination by his  enemies. The fact that his reforms were quickly undone seems to lend  this some credience.

So  Prince Rhaegar was born into this mess and it colored his life from the  beginning. He was considered a sort of melencoly child. He seemed to  excel at whatever he set his mind to, but he was naturally a bookish  sort who enjoyed reading and composing music. He often spent time in the  ruins of the old Summerhall palace and corresponded with his uncle  Aemon at the Wall. During their back and forth correspondence over the  years, both Aemon and Rhaegar brought up the theory that Rhaegar fit the  Azor Ahai prophecy very well. Azor Ahai is mentioned being born amidst  salt and smoke, and Aemon reckoned the smoke fit the fire naturally, and  the salt the tears of the mourners of those who had died in the fire -  which included a good portion of the Realm as Aegon V was popular with  the common folk. This actually inspired Rhaegar to take up martial arms  training as Azor Ahai was reckoned to be a warrior.

As  time went on courtly intrigue kept him busy. He was married to Elia  Martell of Dorne for political reasons. While she was sweet natured she  was also quite frail and while Rhaegar appeared to be fond of her that  probably fell short of real love. She bore him two children but the  strain was clearly more then she could take and additional children were  out of the question. Rhaegar still thought about the old prophecy and  started thinking his 1st son Aegon was actually Azor Ahai due to a comet  that appeared in the sky on the day of his birth. Meanwhile his father  Aerys II was starting to become unstable...and obviously enough that  people were noticing.

Aerys  II started to go mad over a fair amount of time, gradually becoming  more and more obsessed with fire, enemies and traitors in his midst, and  often combining the two. It's my personal speculation that this had  something to do with the Targaryen family's penchant for prophecy. The  whole reason the Targaryens survived the Doom of Valaria unlike the  other Dragon Lords was due to an ancestor ""Daenerys the Dreamer""  forseeing the calamity and inspiring the family patriarch to move to  Dragonstone 12 years before the Doom. In more recent times, in the Dunk  and Egg novels, we run across the sad state of Prince Daeron Targaryen  who spends most of his time drinking... it turns out that he spends that  time drunk because it helps him avoid his prophetic dreams. So we have  evidence of relatively recent prophecy as well as individuals who can't  cope with it very well. I think Aerys II started to get some hints as to  the upcoming calamity in regards to the resurgence of the White  Walkers...and notably fire is one of the few weapons effective against  them. But mentally he just wasn't up to the challenge of dealing with  this and it slowly wore down his sanity.

Meanwhile,  Rhaegar was starting to move towards disposing his father due to said  instability. He organized the Tourney of Harrenhal as a grand event,  ostentatiously to celebrate the youngest new member of the Kingsguard,  one Jaime Lannister (this was mostly seen as a political ploy by Aerys  against Tywin who he was jealous of at this point). But the real purpose  of the Tourney from Rhaegar's perspective was to plot with other  members of the nobility to peacefully transition over to Rhaegar's rule  as by this point he was one of the few remaining reasons that Aerys  remained in power at all as he was personally popular as the heir  apparent. Aerys wasn't big on traveling due to his paranoia and wasn't  expected to attend...until he changed his mind at the last minute. The  overall events of the Tourney are huge in their future ramifications and  many of the future power players in the story show up here - Elia, Ned  and his older brother Bran, Robert Beratheon, Jaime, as well as Lyanna.  But we know curiously little about this important series of events.

One  thing that stands out to me is a relative minor thing - Howland Reed  attended as well. He was a bannerman of the Starks, but due to where he  grew up - essentially a huge marsh - he had precious little experience  with horseback riding or the customary talents needed in a tourney. As a  result he was accosted and picked on by a few of the other Squires in  attendance...and saved by one Lyanna Stark who chased them off with a  tourney sword - a very curious thing for a Lady to do. Aside from her  sense of fairness she was also sticking up for one of her bannermen  which gave her some 'official' motivation to fall back on. Howland was  offered armor and horse to challenge his tormentors but notably didn't  take up the offer, presumably fearing to make a fool of himself. As  'luck' would have it the Knights who the Squires represented each placed  in the Champions for the day and advanced.

The  next day in the Tourney a mystery Knight entered the competition rolls,  the ""Knight of the Laughing Tree"". This Knight was outfitted in a  hodgepodge assortment of armor that fit poorly and was noted to be  'short in stature'. The mystery Knight proceeded to best the three  Knights in question and took their horses and armor as ransom (as  customary). In terms of ransoming their equipment back the mystery  knight asked the defeated to teach their Squires honor and they were  chastised sharply. It's my contention that the person who best fits this  mystery knight is Lyanna Stark.

Now  King Aerys was in attendance (unexpectedly) and took his paranoid view  of things. He demanded Rhaegar determine who this mystery knight was to  avoid assassination. I believe Rhaegar determined Lyanna's role as the  mystery knight and was impressed by her actions. The next day the  mystery knight disappeared, and Rhaegar crowned Lyanna as the ""Queen of  Love and Beauty"" of the Tournament, snubbing his wife and embarassing  Robert publicly.

I  believe Rhaegar crowned Lyanna both to privately honor her actions and  to distract his father from investigating the matter of the mystery  knight any further, as he was liable to burn people at little  provocation at this point.

Now,  after the tourney, Rhaegar's actions go off the rails. He supposedly  later absconds with Lyanna setting off the chain of events that led  inexorably to civil war and then spends most of the time sitting out  said war. This is something completely at odds with his prior actions  and personal character...unless one starts wondering about that pesky  prophecy again. Rhaegar had done some more thinking and concluded 'There  must be a third...the Dragon has 3 heads.' He was convinced that his  3rd child would be Azor Ahai, the savior of the world.

But  his wife Elia was clearly in no shape to bear him another child, and  then Lyanna is introduced to him in dramatic fashion, as well as being a  Stark to his Targaryen - Ice and Fire. I believe Rhaegar knew full well  what his actions would do to the realm, but thought he needed to  complete the prophecy above all else. His later rally of the loyalists  against Robert's rebellion came conspicuously late in the  conflict...well after it could be really effective and he was killed  during the Battle of the Trident. I think he knew what was coming - all  the death involved including his own, his older children, and Lyanna's  per the prophecy, but also did his duty as best he saw it. He was always  a melancholy sort... what if he knew, and  had reason to be if he could  see how things were likely to play out.",14,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

Taking her choice out of it, what three characters could be eliminated that would have had the greatest positive effect for her family? 

You can also look at it from the perspective of what she knew at the time or omniscient, if you could eliminate three characters, what would have helped her and the Starks the most?

I figure Jof would have to go no matter what. Maybe a peace accord could have been struck with Tommen and Sansa marrying...unlikely but possible. The blame for Ned's death was totally on Joff and with him gone maybe the two families could put it behind them...doubtful but possible in GoT world. 

If she didn't know about Tywin then she couldn't mark him for death but he might have pushed to win the war and wipe out the Starks if Jof died. If Tywin were gone then I think the Lannisters are far less formidable at that time. But that is totally debatable. 

Lastly, she could have picked Stannis. Now later on he is an ally of Jon but at the time, the war of the five kings, Stannis (other than Tywin) is probably the only real threat to Robb. I think Robb could have handled the Ironborn and Renley and a Tywinless Lannister family. 

But she likely wouldn't have known to get rid of Stannis or Tywin so she'd probably pick Cersei and Jamie which with Jof would be a devastating blow to that house. Imagining Tywin sitting at a table with Tyrion as the last two is hilarious. ",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'll start!
In the show, I would choose to live in the Arbor, even though it is raided by the Ironborn, it still seems like an ideal spot, considering that it is sort of ""removed"" from much of the action, and it is in the lucrative business of wine. I'd probably be a merchant, in a modest accommodation, just keeping to myself and trying to not get burnt. Free wine to whomever wins the throne! I know in the books that the Ironborn razed the island, but let's ignore that detail for now :)

If we're going by the books, I'd honestly choose to live as a sailor, exploring west of the Iron Islands or explore Ulthos! It's great because you avoid being killed by crazy powerhungry characters and you get to explore the unknown at sea. ",23,8,False,self,,,,,

Well let's get into the evidence shall we:


- One of the biggest forshadowing towards this is the fact that Margaery was once called Pigface at a young age and she ended up growing up to be very beautiful. Arya was called Horseface.

- Arya is said to look like Lyanna, and I don't think the author would mention that if she was not meant to become as beautiful as Lyanna. Ned was also the only true person to see this though lady Smallwood and the Kindly man tell her she is pretty as well.

- Also Bran in one of his visions in the books mistakes Lyanna for Arya.

- It's implied in the text for Winds that Arya got her apartment because she knew how to use her ""Pretty Smile"". Also in the books Arya is training to be a courtesan.

There's also a lot of hints in the show as well:

- In S6 they cast Aisling Franciosi to play Lyanna who looks a lot like Maisie Williams (the actress who plays Arya) and Lyanna looks like a more feminine Arya.

- in S7 when Arya was at the Crossroads Inn Hot Pie told her she was pretty.

- I believe they also may have aged up Arya alittle in the show for two reasons 1. so its doesn't feel awkward when she starts to look more feminine and mature (okay it may still be alittle awkward but still) 2. they can't show a 12 year old get stabbed in the stomach like she did in S6, and 3. Maisie Williams is like 21 years old now.

- When she first enters the courtyard training area in S7 to spray with Brienne the way they film makes it look like they are revealing her as if she just had a makeover or something like that, and yeah Arya does look more beautiful or pretty when she does appear in the courtyard to spray with Brienne. There are also other moments where she look more feminine such as when she reveals herself after killing the Frey's.

- Finally one of the first few promotions leading up to the new season is a ad for the New York Library featuring Maisie as her character reading the first book. However she does seem to have the same costume or hair style she had in S7, take a look for yourself https://i.redd.it/2f0klwt6jy611.jpg Her armour looks only slightly different as I notice the torso is alittle more black while her armour on her torso last season was brown. But also her hair looks much more lighter and curled then last season slicked back hair style. She seems to be wearing Braids which is something only lady like characters wear and Arya is not really lady like. Hmmmm.",7,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

He will in the end become the Lord Commander of the Nightswatch (because so far his whole arc has been about fitting in the NW). He will probably have to part with Gilly and little Sam. She would settle down with his mum and sister at Hornhill. Poor Edd will probably die early on in S8 while fighting the white walkers. I dont think the Nightswatch will be disbanded after the NK will be dealt with, because theres always a chance that he will return in some form (like he did after the first long night). He might also rebuild the wall, maybe even with Brans help (mirroring Bran the builder). 

When the war is over the wheel will be broken. There wont be a single monarch. Instead theyll have a council (like the knights of the round table from the legend of King Arthur). The council will consist of 7 people, thatll parallel the Seven. 

Father (justice) - Jon/ Davos if Jon dies 
Mother (strength of women) - Daenerys 
Maiden (innocence and beauty) - Sansa
Crone (wisdom and foresight) - Bran
Warrior (courage) - Yara/ Theon if she dies
Smith (craftsmanship) - Gendry 
Stranger (death) - Arya


Tyrion will become a traitor 

The rest of the main characters, except Brienne will die. Thoughts?

Id like to hear your predictions as well! Itll be fun to revisit these when the S8 is over.

Coster-Waldau &amp; Headey are among the finest actors in the series. I'm glad they got a nomination. However I can't help but think that however great an actor is, they should not be nominated, let alone win, if the show or episode they featured in is bad. A great actor can't save a bad script.

I'm probably in the minority here in the show only sub but I think GoT started going downhill alternatively from season 5 onward. Yes there were spectacular moments but to me it doesn't make up for the bad writing.",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I decided to watch the first whole episode and realize it seriously tailors to my love of medieval culture. I watched 2-5 episodes a day, and the shit was F\*\*King incredible. The visuals, the developed cultures, and darkness.

This is the best show ever made, and I cannot believe I didn't watch it sooner.

I was so scared to watch the last episode just knowing after I finished I'll be waiting until 2019 to watch more. My god, the production is absolutely fantastic. The worst seasons, like season 5 are STILL good. The expectation for quality of content is so absurdly high in each episode that people seem disappointed often when certain things don't happen but they don't realize that standard of high quality is because of how well produced this show is.

I guess i'll just rot in a hole now, I am lost without more Game of Thrones to watch. 11/10.",55,64,False,spoiler,,,,,

The moments with Tyrion seem to really show this clearly. Nearly every interaction Cersei has with Tyrion she is cruel to him and it's clear she disdains him, she doesn't even make an attempt to hide it.

\&amp;nbsp;

I always understood Ned Stark's warning that ""Winter is coming"" to mean the north above the Neck and Moat Cailin. However, when Jaime rode out of King's Landing in S07E07, he sees snow falling, and we see a lot of it falling in the Dragon Pit in the next scene. The whole time I've watched GOT I've accepted the map as ""horizontal."" Now, I doubt the truth of this and here's why. Unless the planet is a single biome (meaning one contentious feature such as the desert planet Arrakis from Dune), most follow the same general geography. Depending on the tilt of the world, the more north and south one goes, the colder and more covered in snow the land becomes. Conversely, closer to the equator that region becomes more arid and humid, and occasionally both at the same time. Even in fantasy, authors follow the rules of geology and science when it comes to an inhabited planet orbiting a star.

\&amp;nbsp;

Now if you look at The Known World, it doesn't make geographical sense horizontally. If snow, or the long winter, fall as far south as King's Landing, and these winters last for years, then geographically the land should be more northern. For snow to stick and stay stuck for years, the ground has to be colder. Conversely, Esso remains a veritable desert, with pockets of lush forests and southern tropical islands. If Westeros is like Russia, Alaska, and rural Canada, then Esso and the lands east to it are like Africa.

\&amp;nbsp;

The thing is George has never shown us what the continents look like on a globe, so orientation is open to interpretation. The following represents what I believe the map of ""The World"" to be based on common geography and science.

\&amp;nbsp;

[https://i.imgur.com/4N9I6RI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4N9I6RI.jpg)

\&amp;nbsp;

Here's another strong case. Notice that the angle of this map now positions Dorne laterally to Essos. Both are deserts with similar features. Only the fragmented Stepstones divide them. For all we know, these land masses could have been once connected.

First and foremost, this is such a WOW moment as you realized what Ned went through to protect his identity. Ned was literally such a good person and endured so much bullshit. He had to act like he had a baby with a whore, and did had such good morales yet was beheaded. Additionally, Jon Snow had to endure being treated as a bastard his entire life (not that I see why it matters so much but it clearly did in this era and lost you lots of respect) when he actually was a Targaryen and had the blood of dragons. Unreal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Jon would be the rightful heir to the throne after Aerys was murdered. How? First of all, before Viserys died wasn't Viserys the rightful heir, not Jon? I am a little confused on the claims to the throne and who actually should be king by technicalities. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) So Daenerys had sex with her nephew (aka Jon)?",21,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Adding to what [Pycelle mentions about Aerys](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Mad-King-go-mad), *""He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away right before my eyesconsumed by dreams of fire and blood""* It only makes sense to believe that Aerys' decline into madness was triggered by some external event.

My theory is that Bran already saw the Walkers making it to King's Landing (If he can see into the past, it is really a matter of time before he starts seeing the future). He already knows about his ability to warg into the past to effect past events such that they shape the future. So, he goes into the past to plant the idea of filling all of King's Landing with Wild Fire into Aerys' head. Hence, once the walkers reach there, he could *Burn Them All*. This gains leverage with respect to Bran's visions in the episode, *The Door*.

We need to understand that the way the Three Eyed Raven has influenced events in the past comes down to them already having occurred in the current timeline. He can't prevent the Mad King from losing his mind and committing the atrocities he did as a consequence. But he can still salvage it all by saving the rest of the kingdom by getting the Wildfires around the city to stop the advance farther south.

I do predict that in the future not all of the White Walkers will die as a result (Cercei having wasted a whole chunk of the stash in her little fireworks under the Sept of Baelor). So, a final stand has to be taken, but probably not in King's Landing. Dorne would be a more sensible option where the sun scorched kingdom makes up for an even ground to fight.

Well, if so, and this isn't exact, Rob Baratheon is Henry VII (conqueror and married to a woman who is not his biggest fan for political reasons), Joffrey is Henry VIII (just a tad bit temperamental and women change his personality), Margaery is like all of Henry's wives in different aspects, marrying one brother,then the next after death, Cersei calling her a whore etc. Tommen is then Edward VI, a short reign, and although he's not weak and sickly in his body, he relies on his advisors too much, and flip flops between them. Cersei is both the white princess (Henry VII's wife) and Bloody Mary, with the walk of shame being the demarcation between the two. Mary is married to Phillip of Spain, who only wants England and doesn't care for her. This is Euron. I think she's bluffing on the pregnancy, and that bluff will get her killed , though not necessarily the same way as Mary died, to abdominal illness.

That leaves the end of the Tudor dynasty, Elizabeth I. After MaryCersei's death, Phillip/Euron believes the throne is his, and sends the Spanish/Ironborn Armada, which Elizabeth/Dany soundly defeats with pirate/smuggler turned good, Raleigh/Davos' help. Now Elizabeth had a love interest, Robert Dudley/Jon. They were similar in age and had the same tutor, Roger Ascham/the Mormonts. This was a long lasting affair that never led to marriage or children between them. He died first, but she had other suitors.

I currently don't have any plans to make a mod like this, nor do I have the skills. Just want to discuss the possibilities of having a Nights Watch mod for Skyrim with others who would like to play this kinda mod.

My idea would be to have a new landmass that would resemble this map:[http://awoiaf.wester...nd\_the\_wall.jpg](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/6/6c/Westeros_-_Byound_the_wall.jpg)

Then build several settlements, for example: A few castles along the wall, wildling camps and communities throughout the lands north of the wall.

The main quest lines would resemble that of Skyrim, where instead of the dragons, you are fighting the white walkers, and instead of the stormcloaks and imperials you have the Wildlings and the Nights Watch.

I imagine that in these questlines you can upgrade and help develop your camps/castles depending on which faction you fight for, and also try to recruit troops and followers. So for the Nights Watch you send off ravens and do quests for the locals below the wall in exchange for northern lords sending

recruits to help man the wall, and for the wildlings you would do quests that involve challenging other tribes for them to join you.

Magic would be heavily nerfed, with new schools of magic. If you decide to follow the ""School of Maesters"", you could take a carriage to a seperate city ""Oldtown"", and then you could have ""Warging"" as a magic school. Archery and melee weapons would be the main focus with smithing, camping, and foraging being important skills as to survive north of the wall you'd need to level these up.

I know there are big mods out there that try to change Skyrim into Westeros, my plan for this would be to focus specifically on one area and try to include a lot of content. I know the Nights Watch is quite popular so I imagine a lot of people would want to play it. Of course giants and mammoths would be included, as well as children of the forest, white walkers, ice spiders (they have been mentioned several times), and wights.

My friends and I are starting up a game of D&amp;D, and Im taking some inspiration for my barbarian character. While looking up barbaric or savage characters from my favorite books, shows, etc., when I remembered Tormund

Both come from a northern culture that raids and pillages, both can be a little... unsubtle about their thoughts, and both have a connection to bears (My Barbarian pulling his abilities from a bear spirit, and good ol Torm being rumored to plow one)

To make a long post shorter; I want to understand the character of Tormund to be able to channel aspects of him at the table. To understand how he thinks and solves problems. To understand the inner machinations of his mind. To ask What would Tormund do?

I thank yall if you can give me any ideas on how to roleplay as a character like our favorite Tarth-pining crazy wildling

TLDR; Need help figuring out how to roleplay Tormund in a D&amp;D game

Also sorry if this post is too irrelevant to r/gameofthrones. Still newish to Reddit",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I have a theory that I would like to either confirm or deny with you guys. My theory is that Tyrion is going to move to Cerseis side as Season 8 progresses. I came up with this based on the events of the Season Finale of season 7. Most importantly, when Tyrion talks about how nothing meant more to him then the nephews and niece that died. Tyrion then learns that Cersei is pregnant again, and it immediately cuts back to the Dragon pit, where Cersei gives her full support, regardless of whether Jon gives his word not to support Daenerys afterwards. 

Another small details hat may or may not have any real meaning  is near the end of the episode when Tyrion glares at the room Daenerys and Jon are in.

While this is a vision this is a major dropped hint by GRRM and the producers on Daenerys' fate.  The hint is that Daenerys will die in a the fight for King's Landing between the White Walkers and the combined Westerosi army. Now the Khal Drogo and their son portion is Daenerys passing to the Shadowlands that the Dothraki believe are the afterlife. Khal Drogo is obviously believed to be in the Shadowlands by the Dothraki and remember that Daenerys did in fact give birth to the two's son but that the witch doctor killed the baby due to it's grotesque appearance.

Here we go:
Jon Snow will become the knight king. 

As it turns out a person can survive becoming a white walker by proof of Uncle Benjen surviving that fate.  the twist behind the, lets call it an infection, cannot be healed. It can only delay a person from turning into a white walker for hundreds of years.  

Meanwhile, Jon Snow will he forced to face the Knight Kings army head on. He will be turned into a white walker but it will somehow be stopped (not sure who or how yet), similar to Uncle Benjens case. Jon will kill the Knight King, leaving him to be the only remaining source of the infection. he will not be eliminated as he is not yet turned, but it will eventually consume him.  He will then exile himself to the north to live out his days until it consumes him and compels him to become the Knight King. (while hes in the North living out his long life, he will conjure the power the three eyed raven posses)  

The three eyed raven will uncover this is an endless cycle. He will get caught in that seeing it all; all the way back to the beginning.  He will uncover how the previous Three Eyed Ravens throughout history have done their part to prepare Westeros for Winter. Doing so will have him stuck in that realm. While stuck inside the loop he will realize that he can influence certain events (i.e. the god of light, young Ned Stark hearing Bran, etc.). (This would then differ from the Knight Kings ability because he is not stuck in the loop as the three eyed raven is).

Meanwhile, there will be a power struggle. The people will not understand what happens to Jon Snow and become divided over who the next ruler should be. The new king or queen (i cannot guess yet who) will resume life. That is, until the story is ancient and forgotten... winter will come again.

So we've all seen, by now, the finale of Game of Thrones: The Dragon and the Wolf. Of course, we'd all highly-anticipated Daenerys and Jon's joining of houses - both in an official as well as intimate capacity.

However, knowing now what we've learned through the no-longer so young Bran Stark and his all-seeing 3-eyed Raven seeing eyes, what is to come of this new romance? As the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen, Jon now has the best claim to the Iron Throne, especially over his AUNT - who we know feels it is her RIGHT and her DUTY to be Queen. It's an interesting turn of events since I've always favored House Targaryen first and Stark second... But now, Jon represents both houses.

How will Daenerys take it when she discovers the truth? Will she see Jon as a threat to be eliminated? Will Jon even *want*the Iron Throne? Will they truly join their houses, in marriage - I mean, if incest by sibling was permitted, is aunt and nephew really so horrendous? Will it even matter - as there may be no kingdoms left to rule when the Ice King is through with them?

1702,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-9-23,2018,9,23,14,9i67dr,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] How would you rank each season's final scene?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9i67dr/spoilers_how_would_you_rank_each_seasons_final/,FearTheBeardLK,1537681022,"Before anything else, I wanna say I think all 7 have been really really good, all of them leave you with a very powerful final taste. That being said, here's how I would rank them.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Season 1, I mean this is what sets everything up for Dany's story and changes everything even now in S8, the birth of the dragons!
2. Season 5, Jon Snow's death was so unexpected up until a couple seconds before the first stab, definitely a wtf moment, heartbreaking to see his own people betraying him like that.
3. Season 6, I'm a lil bit biased here because ""The Winds of Winter"" is my favorite episode ever and I thought the final scene with the music and everything fit perfectly, very powerful scene too, Dany finally sailing to Westeros.
4. Season 7, We learnt Jon was Lyanna's son in S6 but to know that he isn't a bastard and actually is the heir to the Iron Throne is a whole new thing. Leaves all of us with all these questions of how the characters will react in S8 when they find out.

Okay so for the final 3, the effect they had on the show itself or the next season isn't as big imo but they are still amazing/beautiful scenes.

5. Season 3, I'm not even the biggest fan of Daenerys storyline from S2-S5 bc of some of the breaks she gets, but imo this scene is beautiful, think about it, these people have been slaves all their lives, and someone they've never seen before gets there and tells them that's not the way they have to live the rest of their lives, for many of them she's their mother/savior.

6. Season 4, Another beautiful scene, you get the feeling Arya's life is finally gonna go the right direction after having so many problems along the way (we didn't know as much about the faceless men back then so we wanted to see what they were) and the music again is perfect.

7. Season 2, Don't get me wrong, this scene is great, the only reason I didn't love it as much as the rest probably has more to do with the fact that S3 doesn't really follow this scene (we don't really see the AotD like that again) than with the scene itself which again, is really good, AotD is real and they're coming!  

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah that's mine, keep in mind we're ranking just the final scenes not the whole final episode. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Just keep it respectful, opinions always differ and that's great, this is just to have fun remembering all these amazing scenes.",16,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Varys responds with,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The tunnel was dug for another King's Hand, whose honor would not permit him to enter such a house openly.""

&amp;#x200B;

This was in the beginning of Joffrey's reign so the year is 298. It tells that Chataya has guarded the secret of the tunnel, implying she was there when it was made, so it must be fairly recent I'd think. Looking back at the previous Hands, there's 7 in the last 36 years - Tywin Lannister, Owen Merryweather, Jon Connington, Qarlton Chelsted, Wisdom Rossart, Jon Arryn, and Eddard Stark.

Merryweather and Connington only lasted a few years a piece. Chelsted and Rossart not even a year a piece. I feel like the endeavor of building this tunnel, especially keeping it secret, would take time. So I think there's a good chance it was not any of these four.

Arryn was Hand for quite a while and he was a very honorable man. It is possible it was him, but I doubt it. He didn't seem the type to have fake honor, like you'd need to sneak into a whorehouse through a secret tunnel. That makes it seem like the honor isn't for themselves, but for others... the type who only does the right thing when people are watching. Eddard Stark was not that man, plus we were aware of his perspective for the entirety of his tenure as Hand AND he was only Hand briefly. I think that crosses Arryn and Stark both off.

This leaves Tywin Lannister. As seen in the fourth book/season, he's not as against whores as he claims in public. Since Shae is in his chambers in the Tower of the Hand and I highly doubt he brought her in the front door (neither fear of the Lannisters nor love of gold would keep EVERYONE silent. Someone would spill), then he knows of at least some of the secret towers. And his tenure as Hand was about 20 year under Aerys, so he had plenty of time.

I think the tunnel Tyrion used to sneak out of Chataya's was built by his father.

Here is Sam and Gilly [S4E3]:
@Castle black.
Sam: I worry about it sometimes.
Gilly: Why do you worry about it?
Sam: One hundred man, one woman. 
Gilly: They got other things to think about.
Sam: That's the only thing they think about.
Gilly: Being silly
Sam: I am not being silly. There is a hundred man lying awake at night picturing you.
Gilly: What about you?
Sam: What about me? Gilly.
Sam: I worry about you. 
Gilly: Thank you.
Sam:  For what?
Gilly: For worrying about me.
Sam: I don't know if you are safe here. They are my brothers but they were thieves before they came here, some were rapers. You saw what they did at your fathers keep. 
Gilly: So, what are you saying.
Sam: Maybe you'd be safer in Moles Town. 
Gilly: Are you bored of me?
Sam: Bored of you. I. Want to protect you.

@Mole town.
Sam: I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.
Sam: You'll be safer here. Who is gonna protect you at caste Black, me?
Gilly: You protected me north of the Wall.
Sam: This is different, they're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away which is what we did at Caster's
Sam: You have to trust me! It is for the best.
Gilly: Best for you.
Sam: Gilly, please don't. 

Here is Tyrion and Shae [S4E2]:
Tyrion: Don't
Shae: You want me on the desk? What's wrong my lion.
Tyrion: Don't call me that.
Shae: What should I call you?
Tyrion: I am afraid our friendship can't continue. 
Shae: Our friendship?
Tyrion: There is a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
Shae: What?
Tyrion: And you'll have your own cabin of course. And across the narrow sea a house, servants.
Shae: What is this?
Tyrion: I am a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal. I don't want her to suffer any more on my account. I need to uphold my vows. 
Shae: She doesn't want you, you don't want her.
Tyrion: I need to do right by her. By our children
Shae: What are you afraid of?
Tyrion: I am not afraid.
Shae: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister, you are going to run from them all your life?
Tyrion: I need you to leave.
Shae: I am not afraid of them. I am not going to run from them.
Tyrion: Shae
Shae: We'll fight them together. It is like you said, I am yours and you are mine.
Tyrion: You are a whore. 
Tyrion: Sansa, is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore, I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with, five hundred, five thousand? 
Shae: How many whores have you been with?
Tyrion: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all, but now that time is over. 
Shae: *crying*
Tyrion opens the door for Bron to come in.
Tyrion: You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bron will escort you to your ship. 
Shae hits Bron and walks away. 


So these both men accomplish their goals however in very different manners. Both the men and the women acknowledge the danger of their present situation. Sam approaches this from his personal care for Gilly, Tyrion, however, argues as his father would. These scenes contrast each other and thereby show even more character details. 

What do you think?

So I am thinking about their careers post Thrones. Look at Star Wars where Harrison Ford were he was able to break away from Han Solo but Mark Hamill was kind of stereotyped. Friends actors had varying degrees of success. Then there is the Seinfeld curse..

&amp;#x200B;

I love all of these actors and wish them success post GOT. That said, here are my unscientific predictions.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Kit Harrington will be typecast and find it difficult to break out of the Jon Snow preconception.

\* Peter Dinklage - difficult to break away from Tyrion typecast

\* Maisie Williams,Lena Heady,Aiden Gillen, Ian Glen,NathalieEmmanuel, Conleth Hill, Issaac HempsteadWright, Liam Cunningham, Kristofer Hivju, Jerome Flynn are versatile enough in appearanceand/or range that they will have successful post Thrones careers  Lot of great opportunities for character actors, BBC series, period dramas, and film success

\* Richard Dormer - if not as an actor this guy will have a spectacular voice-over career

\* Sophie Turner - varying

\* Emelia Clarke - varying

\* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau -varying, mostly typecast in good-looking guy roles

\* John Bradley - typecast in side kick roles

\* Rory McCann -typecast in muscle roles

\* Gwendoline Christie - varying

My name is Omar, and I'm a HUGE fan of the series. I'm a little bit late to the r/gameofthrones game, but I thought I'd share my predictions for next season with everyone on here. I've rewatched the entire show several times now, and I feel like I am confident about some of my predictions for the final season. So without further ado, here is my list of predictions:

* Arya Stark and Melisandre, the Red Woman, are going to meet in this final season. For those who do not remember, in Season 3 Episode 6 (The Climb), Melisandre takes Gendry so that Stannis could use his blood to win the War of the Five Kings. As Melisandre takes him away, Arya confronts her. Melisandre then proceeds to say the following to Arya: ""I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."" The two have not met as of yet.
* Jaime Lannister will arrive at Winterfell, and Bran Stark will probably drop the bombshell that Jaime is the one who pushed him out of the window. Before things can get chaotic, however, I'm thinking that Bran might thank Jaime, for if it weren't for him, he wouldn't be where he is at the moment.
* Daario Naharis will come to Westeros in accordance with the Golden Company's arrival. Whether that will be in an attempt to warn/save Daenerys or fight her is not something I am yet certain of.
* I believe Jaime Lannister will die on the watch of Brienne of Tarth. The reason I think this will happen is Brienne said something in Season 5: ""Nothing is more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.""
* Cersei will likely sacrifice Qyburn or leave him for dead in order to save her own skin.
* The dragons will die with the White Walkers as a way to balance things out. A balance between Ice and Fire. The magic will leave the world of Westeros with the deaths of both sides.
* Daenerys and Drogon will go down together. I don't see either of them surviving without the other to be honest.
* Beric Dondarrion has a massive part to play this coming season. I'm not sure what it is, but I think it's gonna be huge.
* There will be a huge battle at Winterfell. It is mentioned at one point in the series that Winterfell could hold off 10 thousand assailants with only 500 defenders manning it.
* Nymeria and her pack of wolves are going to join the Great War.
* The dragons will die some pretty gruesome deaths. I don't know why, but I'm expecting something shocking.
* Sansa might just survive everything. Because that's what she is: a survivor. She survived Joffrey, she survived Ramsay, and she could very possibly survive the Great War. She and Cersei could be the last ones standing. It would be rather poetic, paying homage to the relationship they had in the earlier seasons. I really would love to see at least one more scene with the two of them together.
* Varys' story will have some shocking twists. Remember that we still do not know his full story. Look out for this guy.

I'll update this list as I remember more predictions I made/think of new ones. Please feel free to share your opinions and thoughts!",101,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I was thinking maybe the actor's ages has something to do with it as well (not saying it would be the main reason at alm but maybe something they've considered). My point is if they did 10-12 seasons before the Great War like George said a few weeks ago, some of the characters are gonna be 10-12 years older than they were in the 1st season and correct me if I'm wrong as I haven't read the books but Ned Stark announced winter was coming since the first episode so I don't think 10+ years are supposed to go from S1 till winter. I know they can use makeup and stuff but the difference in age could definitely be noticeable especially for some of the young ones like Arya, Sansa, Jon and Dany to name a few. Idk, just something that crossed my mind today. Now this doesn't explain why S7 and 8 can't be 10 episodes each like the previous ones but could be one of the reasons why it can't really go for 3, 4 or 5 more seasons.",64,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm pretty confident that a few seasons ago the Hound coming across a fire witch would be a pretty hostile encounter considering his history with fire, but how do you think that'd change now that Beric/ Thoros have seemingly converted him? Another example that's kinda cheating since they have a scene together in s1 is Jaime and Jon. Last time they were together Jon seemed pretty pissed about Jaime's view on the nights watch. I wonder if his experience of getting backstabbed by his brothers, or falling in love with Ygritte, will have Jon seeing the merit in Jaime's view?

So what do you think will happen if/ when any of these characters meet up? What other characters that haven't had any screen time together do you want to see in S8 and how do you see the encounter going?",29,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

After watching the 7th episode in the first season I got confused(part of these ""questions"" are not really question but rather just making sure I understand what is going on):

1.I know Robert wanted Joffrey to be his successor because he thought he was his son, but I don't understand what Ned wrote down in the letter. Did he mean by my rightful successor to Joffrey or Robert's brother?

2.What was Ned's plan? to let Robert's brother role and then to let Joffrey role when Robert's brother dies?

3.Why did Joffrey got angry when sir Sebastian read the letter? is it because he wanted to role right away and if they had followed the letter he would have needed to wait until he grows up?

4.Why did cersai got angry? is because she wanted her son to role right away and if they had followed the letter she would have needed to wait until Joffrey grows up?

5.Why did Ned need the men to protect him? is it because he thought Cersei was going to kill him because he knew about Jamie and her and she thought he would try to make sure she or her son doesn't role?

When he insists that Arya eat his meal because it's mutton and he doesn't like mutton, he wasn't being generous, he was having her test his food for poison. After all, he still thought that there was an infiltrator from the brotherhood without banners among their ranks following the assassination of Amory Lorch. Additionally, he was curious about Arya's indentity (luckily, not too curious) and he had already caught her lying about her who she was once. Take note of him observing the way she handles a fork and knife which confirms what he already suspected, that she is highborn after he already made her admit that she's a Northerner.

I know I am alittle late as we will hopefully be getting some more ads and Promo vids/image soon but better then late then ever right? 2. I know I have tried doing this multiple times but I have taken those down and these are my final FINAL predictions that I am sticking with until I am proven wrong other wise, 3. I have NOT red any ""Leaks"" (I use bunny ears because I don't there multiple ones that are most likely fake nor are they from the same guy from last year) nor have I looked at any set photos, I only know a small amount so I will combining the small amount I know with some of my OWN ideas. Also unlike my predictions for last year, Which i'll leave a link too: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5r12r5/s7_my_late_season_7_predictions/

I will be doing something atlittle different, instead of writing it like a full story I will be doing it more like a outline and just going through each character's fates and also big things I think will happen in the season just to cut to the point, Now I got that out of the way let's begin:

- First up I think the NK will bring down the rest of the wall, killing Edd and the remaining NW (now weather or not he uses the Undead Viserion to bring the rest down or him and the other white walkers do what they did to the force field around 3ER's cave is up to debate).

- I also do believe Euron and the GC will surprise attack WF and set it aflame, But weather or not someone like Jon or Sansa gets captured and taken to KL and haven't decided yet. But it will lead to Euron getting executed by the Mountain after it's revealed by Qyburn he was going to betray Cersei, and Harry changing sides stating ""Red or Black a Dragon is a Dragon"" and helping whomever got captured overthrowing Cersei (if Jon gets captured it makes sense for Harry to change sides since Jon is a Targ, if It's Sansa it be poetic for obvious reasons) with Qyburn and Mountain pretending to change sides and Cersei imprisoned.

- Jon Snow I think will get smack from the Northern lords, Sansa, and even Arya for bending the knee but the sisters and some Northern Lords will grow to accept Dany. Also Jon will not only have the truth revealed to him (his parentage) but also he is Lightbringer with his Father Rhaegar being Azor Ahai and Lyanna being Nissa Nissa, In the end he will decline the offer to rule the Crownlands and return North to rule there and raise his twin children with Dany by his side.

- I believe Mel and Arya will meet again but Mel will be in her old lady form, I believe in the first battle against the AOTD Mel will raise her own dead to fight the NK's wights. I believe she will give the kiss of life to Dany.

- The Stark children, I personally believe Bran will have a part in defeating the NK, In this case he may get into a battle of the minds with the NK and maybe even preform a Hold the Door 2.0 on him. Now I originally thought maybe Bran leaves of piece of himself in the NK when trying to Warg him in the past and maybe Arya has to stabbed him in the heart with catspaw in order to weaken the NK but I don't think Bran will die, I think after all is said and done Bran will leave to go beyond the former wall to be the new 3ER. Arya I think we will not only see a more human/sympathetic side to Arya next season but also I think she will live and marry Gendry becoming Queen of the Crownlands or sail west of Westeros with Gendry by her side. Sansa I believe may or may not have a romance with Pod but will die sacrificing herself saving Arya (paralleling Lady and Nymeria).

- For the Lannisters, Cersei I believe will have a miscarriage and grow much more Mad and Paranoid and with all her allies gone (Harry and GC changing sides and Euron maybe even getting executed by Cersei via the Mountain after he brings her a possible hostage (Jon or Sansa) and also it getting revealed that Euron was going to betray Cersei to win Dany's trust), The citizens turning on her, and her being imprisoned after Harry changed sides Qyburn frees her and puts dragonglass into her chest turning her into the Night Queen. She is killed by either Arya forcing a bottle of Wildfire down her pale white throat or giving her to the Commonfolk to stab to death with Dragonglass. Jaime and Bronn will get an army in the Riverlands made up of 300 or 100 Sellswords and Edmure and Frey/Tully forces and will save the Starks and other survivors in WF. Dying North in Brienne's arms (Bronn and Edmure will die also). Tyrion will probably do something big in this season and by the end will become King of the Westerlands and open a vineyard (or Crownlands if Arya and Gendry sail west, with a new house getting the Westerlands).

- NK like I said I believe will destroy the rest of the Wall. The first battle against him and the living will be in the North while Euron and the GC are surprise attacking WF for Cersei and the second battle in KL, his backstory will be revealed and that he and the WW's are not just mindless killing machines (and he is possibly NOT the first WW but The Night's King/The 13th Lord Commander) and the WW's have returned due to a Resurgence in magic, Jon's Birth, being threatened by Red Followers burning Weirwood, and wanting to end the curse the children put on them. his final battle with Jon will be in either the God's Eye or the Dragonspit and at some point Bran will have a battle of the minds with him which will weaken/distract him long enough for Jon to best him and Sam and Jon remove the Dragonglass from his chest resulting in NK dying a mortal man, the Wights collapsing, and WW's turning back human (though I think it be pretty cool if someone we didn't expect to defeat the NK like Davos or Beric defeated him)

- Longclaw is destroyed in the first battle against the dead and Sam gives Jon Heartsbane. But ICE will be reforged by the end of the story.

- Gendry will die but Beric will give him the kiss of Life, also CLEGANEBOWL happens with Sandor winning but dying not long after too bloodlose.

- Dany I believe will not be Queen or sit the Iron Throne by the end. I believe all her dragons will be killed by the end. With Undead Viserion being killed by Rhaegal, Rhaegal dying killing Viserion, and Viserion will break Drogon's neck and fall with Drogon. Dany body will still be somewhat in tact thanks to Drogon's body stopping her speed alittle bit to not make the impact as bad but she will still die. Mel, Jorah, and Missendei will find her and as Dany is seeing visions of Drogo and her child Mel gives her the kiss of Life bringing both her and her unborn children back. She will decide not to rule Westeros and rule the North with Jon (she is a conquer not a queen, also she may decide 'Maybe the Iron Throne is not worth it"" after all is said and done).

- Varys will be revealed to be allies with harry and even coming with him and Euron to KL pretending to be on Cersei's side only for him and Harry to revealed not to be, However he will be revealed to be on neither Dany or Cersei side and will have his own agenda involving the Blackfyre's, but he will die (he may also set off the wildfire in KL but I have not decided yet).

- The throne will be melted down and a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established. Plus the Seven Kingdoms will be made there own separate, independent kingdoms once more.

- Also Theon will try to save Yara after discovering Euron's lie but will be forced to put a tongueless Reek like Yara out of her misery, and Theon will die in the battle against the AOTD in KL. a New house rules Pyke. Roslin rules the Riverlands until her son with Edmure comes of age.

- Robin survives (though Yohn Royce doesn't) and becomes King of the Vale, Also a new house rules the Stormlands and a likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne. 

- Davos, Pod, Harry, Jorah and Brienne will live to the end. Harry will assign a new GC leader and have them leave back to Essos with Harry staying to be a Kingsgaurd and leave some gold from them to use to rebuild KL, Brienne and Jorah also become Kingsgaurd (also the rules for the Kingsgaurd change and now Woman can join and members are allowed to marry and have children) Pod becomes a Archer realizing he is better with a bow and arrow then a sword. Davos becomes hand.

- Sam and Gilly become King and Queen of the Reach and Sam write the Song of Ice and Fire.

- Qyburn flees Westeros and is never heard from again, He is presumed dead.

People who Live: Jon, Dany, Arya, Bran, Pod, Davos, Brienne, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, Gendry, Robin, Nymeria and her Wolfpack, Hot Pie, Tyrion, Roslin and Edmure's son, Lyanna Mormont, Missendei, Qyburn, Jorah, and Harry Strickland.

People who die: Edd and the NW, Tormund, Ghost, Grey Worm, Bronn, Edmure, Yohn Royce, Theon, Yara, Damphair, Euron, The Mountain, The Hound, Mel, Varys, Jaime, All of Dany's dragons, Beric, Cersei, Sansa, and the NK.",14,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hes went through the full story being mocked as the king slayer when really he did it for the good of the people. Theres a scene when hes seen reading the book of the leaders of the kings guard and Joffrey mocks him saying That hes Jamie Lannister the king slayer, stabbed aerys Targaryen in the back and killed him. He responds back stating that there is still time yet for more to wrote about him.

Hes en route to winterfel I expect, Danny will be wanting to kill to for all hes done however through a combination of Tyrion word smithery and Brans vision she will allow him to fight with them.

Were watching and were at the end, the last part before the episode ends. Im watching and I cant wait for his reaction. But then...there isnt one? Im confused.

I like this scene even more than the Jon Snow King in the North scene, because it has a much more intense catharsis. Jon became King in the North after over coming everything imaginable, winning against the Wildlings, reuniting with them, fighting the White Walkers, dying, being resurrected, defeating Ramsey Bolton etc. It's a logic consequence for him to become King in the North.

Yet in S1 everything is way more depressing, the main player of the North Ned Stark is dead, executed somewhere in the South. Robb Stark becoming the King is a huge risk for every man in the north, but the people have lost all of their trust, they are desperate and they reach out to the only opportunity given to them  - they see the young Robb Stark as the only one who can step into Ned Starks role.

2005,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-9-28,2018,9,28,5,9jg7ts,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Obvious symbols foreshadow our favorite characters' deaths,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9jg7ts/spoilers_obvious_symbols_foreshadow_our_favorite/,TryhardBrody,1538078794,"So here goes my theory, I've been watching Game of Thrones for a little while, and something struck me as odd the second time I watched season six. This comes in the trial scene in episode 10. While they cut between all the major players preparing for the trial, there is a very subtle level of symbolism that denotes who dies and who lives in the Sept of Baelor. X's, physical X's, appear in shots with characters meant to die, while Cersei seems to break free from the X's in her room saying she will avoid death for now. Attached are some (very low quality, my apologies) images showing the X's in the various scenes. This technique is not new, starting from, I believe, the original Scarface film and then being used again in The Departed. Though both these films used the symbolism often and not very subtly. Game of Thrones appears to be hiding this a lot better, using the natural backgrounds and settings and even costume designs to hide their X's. Without further ado, here is the evidence.

1. ) First we have a simple one, Loras being dragged into the Sept by sparrows with the cross made of chains. It's subtle, most would probably chalk it up to costume design but since when is Game of Thrones ever not so deliberate as to tell the story through costume? I believe the design of the Sparrows was probably very deliberate and made for this purpose of symbolism in their final scene. Think of Cersei's quote, ""\[I blew up\] all his little sparrows, because it felt good to be rid of them."" All those little Sparrows she refers to wear this X on their chests. [https://imgur.com/e2GN2Tu](https://imgur.com/e2GN2Tu)

2. ) Now this one is a little tougher to see but here is why I believe it is intentional. Maragaery's first shot is a perfect mirror of Tommen's. Profile of the head, and an X pattern on the window behind them. For this reason I think it is deliberate as both characters are the two shocking deaths of this sequence of events so why not present it the same way? I'm only including Maragery's at the moment because Tommen's is far more obvious which I'll get to later. Look hard, you can see a perfect pattern of X's behind the Queen's head. [https://imgur.com/w0CRlLE](https://imgur.com/w0CRlLE) 

3. ) Here is the High Sparrow's X. Much like Loras Tyrell's it comes in the form of the chains across the Sparrows. Look at how menacing the sparrow is, how deliberately he is placed behind the High Sparrow. He is just as much the focus of the shot as the High Sparrow himself, very intentional symbolism. [https://imgur.com/tYE0owm](https://imgur.com/tYE0owm)

4. ) Now Lancel has plenty of X's. I assume people will point to a lot of them as being pure coincidence but think about just how deliberate the placement of the shots are, the settings are completely designed to fit the episode, these details are not put in out of coincidence. Maybe one is a reach, but even I feel as though the shot of his sandal was very focused and probably another reach at symbolism. Specifically, the first X is the design on the door of the Sept as Lancel walks outside. The second one appears when he is chasing the child in the tunnels, it's small but look to the corner of the wall for a white X, what makes me think it's intentional is how it is essentially the center of the shot. The final one is seen on the straps of his sandals as he crawls down the vault. The focus of the shot is entirely on his feet, notice how the X's even come forward into the fire of his dropped torch at the end of the shot, symbolic of how he will die. [https://imgur.com/a/cfBw0in](https://imgur.com/a/cfBw0in)

5. ) Next up I want to show a subtle one we only see for a brief moment. While many open and overhead shots of the Sept are shown there is only one instance for which this X makes an appearance. It is in the statue of the Warrior in the upper left corner whose swords are crossed to form an X. We never see his statue while the Sept is empty or while it is filling, only once it is completely full of every person Cersei plans to murder do we see the X, making me believe it's inclusion is symbolic and intentional. [https://imgur.com/PLDMAWB](https://imgur.com/PLDMAWB)

6. ) Although she lives, shots including Cersei are not devoid of symbolism. In these three images we see that one, she has a different geometric design on some of her windows, unlike virtually everyone else we see who has an X pattern. Two, we see that she breaks free, exiting from her confined room to the terrace, leaving the X's behind her in the dark while she steps into the light. And three, her's is the only room with ivy growing. Green like the wildfire, and quite literally covering up her X's in certain other shots, this symbolizes how she will use the wildfire to escape certain condemnation. [https://imgur.com/a/bF0gQWC](https://imgur.com/a/bF0gQWC)

7. ) I did save the best for last despite going out of chronological order in the scenes. Here we have Tommen's X's, possibly the most shocking death of this entire sequence, and thus deserving of more than a little intensely obvious symbolism. The pattern on his window as he sits waiting to leave, the pattern on his window as we see the single shot of him climbing the ledge and jumping to his death. But the most obvious one, the one we have been so oblivious to, is one where the pattern on his window is shot so closely that we can only see the X and not the repeating pattern. It is a unnecessary shot, Tommen does nothing to prepare for the trial, he only gazes off in the direction of the X we see. The entire purpose of this shot is symbolism and foreshadowing. If you had any doubt about whether or not this is intentional by the show, this should convince you otherwise. [https://imgur.com/a/hbqxkVS](https://imgur.com/a/hbqxkVS)

Now why does all of this matter? We all know how this scene goes and all the potential deaths foreshadowed by the X's have happened. All the characters are now dead. But this means we can look to the future, and a certain special scene in season 7 episode 6 makes me believe with full confidence we will lose our most beloved hero. In the second to final scene Daenery's talks to Jon on the boat, saying she believes in the threat and will commit to fighting it, while Jon shows just as much humility and declares Dany his queen. Here is where I worry. For the majority of this scene shots of Jon focus on just that, Jon Snow himself. But as the scene nears its close we get a tighter shot, where Jon takes up the right half of the screen and his bedpost takes up the left half. Look to the bedpost, a clear cut metal X hammered right next to Jon Snow's head. It is just as much the focus of the shot as Jon is, and we even get a glimpse of something we've grown familiar with, Jon laying motionless with closed eyes as if dead. And while he lays like that, an X inches from his head. It is my prediction that they are calling the death of Jon Snow in the final season, and this symbolism is all the proof we need. [https://imgur.com/a/Q2oGIbe](https://imgur.com/a/Q2oGIbe)

In conclusion, this is my first ever reddit post so my apologies if the formatting is off or if it is too lengthy. I'll learn the ropes eventually. I was driven to create an account and make this post out of my love for Game of Thrones, and because after conducting multiple internet searches I have not found a single mention of this symbolism or foreshadowing yet. If it has been posted about before my apologies, and credit to whoever spotted it, but I do not believe the internet has caught on to this yet. With a show that uses mirrored shots (think Jon arriving at Hardhome vs. when the Night King claims victory) and extremely advanced foreshadowing I would be more surprised to hear that all these X's were coincidences rather than intentional. Anyways, thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed my analysis and please leave your thoughts below, especially if you find more X's that have occurred during the series which I am also currently rewatching and looking for.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ive been rereading the series and came across the chapter where Biter EATS BRIENNESS FACE OFF. And it gave a graphic description of his appearance. 

Brienne's chest was burning, and the storm was behind her eyes, blinding her. Bones ground against each other inside of her. Biter's mouth gaped open, impossibly wide. She saw his teeth, yellow and crooked, filed into points. When they closed on the soft meat of her cheek, she hardly felt it. She could feel herself spiraling down into the dark. I cannot die yet, she told herself, there is something I still need to do. 

Biter's mouth tore free, full of blood and flesh. He spat, grinned, and sank his pointed teeth into her flesh again. This time he chewed and swallowed. He is eating me, she realized, but she had no strength left to fight him any longer. She felt as if she were floating above herself, watching the horror as if it were happening to some other woman, to some stupid girl who thought she was a knight. It will be finished soon, she told herself. Then it will not matter if he eats me. Biter threw back his head and opened his mouth again, howling, and stuck his tongue out at her. It was sharply pointed, dripping blood, longer than any tongue should be. Sliding from his mouth, out and out and out, red and wet and glistening, it made a hideous sight, obscene. His tongue is a foot long, Brienne thought, just before the darkness took her. Why, it looks almost like a sword.

\-The actor who plays Bran said that a good portion of the fandom will be disappointed when they see it..also Maise williams(arya) and Emilia clarke said that it's gonna be divisive and few days ago Sophie turner(Sansa) said the exact same..

and Kit Harington seemed disappointed  just like he was disappointed with The soprano's finale and breaking bad..

with that being said i think nothing  predictable can divide fans and make them disappointed.

we can also assume that those statements are just teasing the fans for something bad gonna happen cause at the end GRRM said before that it's not gonna be a happy ending but instead it will be a bittersweet one.

  i can think of at least 4 ways to end it and all of them will be good enough to satisfy the fans but i'll respect the show more if it went to an entirely different direction and end with a bald ending even i didn't like it.

But, after watching S7E4, (the attack on the Lannister army), my attitude for her has done a 180.  What she did was absolutely brutal, Id say just as brutal as things Cersei has done.  

Also, the way she treated the captives shows rule through fear.  And what she did to the Tarleys is scarily reminiscent to her father.  I understand the reason for execution, but the method was truly evil.

Some others over here said Jaime could be Dany's military commander if Tyrion vouches for him - do you really expect her to give command over all her armies to Jaime??? Yes, we know that Jaime is a better man than he was years ago, but they don't - it'd be follish to trust him and risk angering the North by appointing him.

&gt;Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices. Choices that might look wrong to others, but that you know are right in the long run.

Look at his face as Sam explains the rationale behind Jon's decision. There's a lot going on there. He's realizing the hard choice he's going to have to make, one that he thinks will be right in the long run. While I assume that one of the senior members of the watch, like Ser Alliser, **this** was probably the moment where he decided he would help.

The Final Season.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9k29mq/spoilers_my_late_season_8_predictions_the_final/,darrylthedudeWayne,1538270328,"Okay so I already made a post on this but I accidentally deleted it, so I am posting it again. That and I going to make some changes after rereading it anyways, anyways here is the new and improved post.

Okay so today I am going to give you my predictions for the final season of Game of Thrones, before I start a few things 1. I know I am alittle late on this as they have started to show footage with the first official footage in the HBO promo this year but better late then ever right? 2. I have made predictions on S8 in the past, but I took them down because I didnt like the quality of them and this one will be my final FINAL predictions and the ones I am sticking with until I am completely proven wrong otherwise. 3. I have NOT read any Leaks for the new season (I use bunny ears because all of them are not from the same guy from last year) nor have I seen a lot of the set photos, The very few set photos I have seen and also the small amount of Leaks I know about will be combined with my own ideas however for my predictions, But for the most part I have not read any leaks or seen all the set photos so please if you plan on mentioning them use spoiler tags.

Also unlike my predictions from last year which Ill leave a link to here https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5r12r5/s7_my_late_season_7_predictions/

I will be not only writing them in the form of an outline rather then a full paragraphed fan-fiction, but also I am only going to get to the point. As in I am not going to mention stuff we know will most likely happen (such as Jons various reunions, NK attacking Karhold and Last Hearth, and Theon getting to Pyke only to learn of Eurons lie) and mainly focus on characters fates and some big moments that I think will happen, So without further ado on with the show.

-	The NK I believe will dispose of the rest of the Nights Watch resulting in Edds death (weather or not he brings done the rest of the wall to do idk, but I would like the rest of the wall to be destroyed)
-	I also believe the first battle against the dead will be in the North with J&amp;D and there armies fighting against AOTD while WF is surprise attacked by Euron and the GC (which I think could result in a important character being taken hostage in order to end the bloodshed at WF, in this case either Jon or Sansa though I havent decided yet) but the second battle is at KL.
-	Mel I think will meet Arya again as forshadowed in S3, however I believe Mel will be in old lady form meaning Arya will not recognize her at first. Mel will also raise some of the dead and use them against the NK, Mel will also indeed die as forshadowed last season but how she will die? I personally believe it will be giving the kiss of life to one of Danys children or Dany herself.
-	 Jon I believe will get the truth revealed to him by Sam and Bran and he will probably have to accept that he is both a Targaryen and a Stark, However he will lose Ghost in the first battle and his sword Longclaw I believe will be destroyed by the NK but Sam will give him Heartsbane. Jon I think will be offered the Iron Throne but decline it and have it melted down as he decides to go home to the North and raise his children as Ned did for him with Dany by his side or on his own, Also ICE is reforged.
-	I dont believe Dany will rule Westeros or get the Iron Throne by the end, I believe all three of her Dragons will be gone before the end of the season and I see one of two fates for her. Before the final battle in KL she will go into labour and give birth to twins (surviving childbirth) but one of them is not breathing and Mel will give that child the kiss of life. Afterwards Dany will die in battle with Drogon against the NK, or she will not go into labour at all and when she and Drogon die her body will still be in tact and Mel will give her the kiss of life bringing her and her unborn children back.
-	For the Starks. I believe Arya will survive through all of this and may sail to lands west of Westeros with Gendry by her side, I also believe we will start to see a more sympathetic side of Arya next season with her regaining her Humanity, Sansa I think will die saving Arya (paralleling Nymeria and Lady), and Bran I believe will help in the defeat of the NK by having a battle of the minds with him (maybe even pull a Hold the Door 2.0 on the NK) weakening him, and I originally thought maybe Bran left a piece of himself in the NK while he was being turned and Bran will have to stab Catspaw in his heart to weaken the NK and while that is still possible, I believe it be a better twist if Bran lived to the end and went beyond the former wall to take his place as the 3ER.
-	As for the Lannisters, Jaime &amp; Bronn will gather the Frey/Tully forces with Edmure and march North, I think they will save whomever is left after the surprise attack from the AOTD and Jaime will sacrifice himself saving Bran and/or Arya and die in the arms of the woman he loves Brienne (Bronn will die also), Tyrion will in my opinion live to the end and become Lord of Crownlands, open a Vineyard and finally finish that joke, Cersei will have her miscarriage and grow more mad and paranoid and with Harry Strickland and the GC changing sides she has Qyburn turn her into the Night Queen. But she will die at the hands of Arya via Catspaw to the chest (where the Dragonglass was put in) while she wraps her hand around her pale white throat.
-	NK and WWs will be revealed that they are not just mindless monsters wanting to kill everything and that there is a reason for there return that even connects to the symbols they make (there return is a combination of Resurgence in Magic, Jons birth, Being threatened by the burning of Weirwoods by Red Priest, and wanting to end the curse the children put on them) 
-	Jon being Lightbringer fights him 1v1 and Bran has a battle of the minds with him to distract/weaken him, its successful and with Sams help removes the Dragonglass from NKs chest, Making him die a mortal man, As the other WWs turn back human and all the Wights collapse.
-	The Kingdoms will be made independent and in each one a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established after Iron Throne is melted down.
-	Varys I think will be revealed to be more then he seems and it may involve him betraying Dany in the name of House Blackfyre, but will die in the end.
-	House Greyjoy I think will go extinct with Theon being forced to put a tonguless Yara out of her misery, Damphair dying in Theons arms, and Theon dying killing Euron in the final battle.
-	CLEGANEBOWL, Sandor wins but dies not long after too bloodlose. Also Beric gives Gendry the kiss of life.
-	Sam and Gilly will become Lord and Lady of the Reach and the Bittersweet ending will be the war is one but at a great cost as many friends, family, and good people dead and Jon possibly lost another lover.
-	Qyburn has fled Westeros and is never heard from again, he is presumed dead.

People who live: Jon, Bran, Arya, Brienne, Davos, Missendei, Qyburn, Hot Pie, Nymeria and her wolfpack, Gendry, Tyrion, Roslin and Edmures son, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, Robin, Lyanna Mormont, Harry Strickland, and Podrick.

People who die: Cersei, The Mountain, Varys, Sandor, Beric, Grey Worm, Tormund, Ghost, Yohn Royce, Ned Umber, Lord Glover, Alys Karstark, Jorah, Damphair, Theon, Yara, Euron, Mel, Sansa, Edmure, All of Danys dragons, Bronn, Jaime, Illyn Payne, and the NK.

You know Ned wouldn't be able to prevent himself from bringing up the murder of Rhaegar and Elia's children, and his dishonourable betrayal of the Mad King. Tywin of course would not allow himself to be visibly fazed and not back down from Starks challenge.

That and I going to make some changes after rereading it anyways, anyways here is the new and improved post.

Okay so today I am going to give you my predictions for the final season of Game of Thrones, before I start a few things 1. I know I am alittle late on this as they have started to show footage with the first official footage in the HBO promo this year but better late then ever right? 2. I have made predictions on S8 in the past, but I took them down because I didnt like the quality of them and this one will be my final FINAL predictions and the ones I am sticking with until I am completely proven wrong otherwise. 3. I have NOT read any Leaks for the new season (I use bunny ears because all of them are not from the same guy from last year) nor have I seen a lot of the set photos, The very few set photos I have seen and also the small amount of Leaks I know about will be combined with my own ideas however for my predictions, But for the most part I have not read any leaks or seen all the set photos so please if you plan on mentioning them use spoiler tags.
Also unlike my predictions from last year which Ill leave a link to here 
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5r12r5/s7_my_late_season_7_predictions/

I will be not only writing them in the form of an outline rather then a full paragraphed fan-fiction, but also I am only going to get to the point. As in I am not going to mention stuff we know will most likely happen (such as Jons various reunions, NK attacking Karhold and Last Hearth, and Theon getting to Pyke only to learn of Eurons lie) and mainly focus on characters fates and some big moments that I think will happen, So without further ado on with the show.

- The NK I believe will dispose of the rest of the Nights Watch resulting in Edds death (weather or not he brings done the rest of the wall to do idk, but I would like the rest of the wall to be destroyed)

- I also believe the first battle against the dead will be in the North with J&amp;D and there armies fighting against AOTD while WF is surprise attacked by Euron and the GC (which I think could result in a important character being taken hostage in order to end the bloodshed at WF, in this case either Jon or Sansa though I havent decided yet) but the second battle is at KL.

- Mel I think will meet Arya again as forshadowed in S3, however I believe Mel will be in old lady form meaning Arya will not recognize her at first. Mel will also raise some of the dead and use them against the NK, Mel will also indeed die as forshadowed last season but how she will die? I personally believe it will be giving the kiss of life to one of Danys children or Dany herself.

- Jon I believe will get the truth revealed to him by Sam and Bran and he will probably have to accept that he is both a Targaryen and a Stark, However he will lose Ghost in the first battle and his sword Longclaw I believe will be destroyed by the NK but Sam will give him Heartsbane. Jon I think will be offered the Iron Throne but decline it and have it melted down as he decides to go home to the North and raise his children as Ned did for him with Dany by his side or on his own, Also ICE is reforged.

- I dont believe Dany will rule Westeros or get the Iron Throne by the end, I believe all three of her Dragons will be gone before the end of the season and I see one of two fates for her. Before the final battle in KL she will go into labour and give birth to twins (surviving childbirth) but one of them is not breathing and Mel will give that child the kiss of life. Afterwards Dany will die in battle with Drogon against the NK, or she will not go into labour at all and when she and Drogon die her body will still be in tact and Mel will give her the kiss of life bringing her and her unborn children back.

- For the Starks. I believe Arya will survive through all of this and may sail to lands west of Westeros with Gendry by her side, I also believe we will start to see a more sympathetic side of Arya next season with her regaining her Humanity, Sansa I think will die saving Arya (paralleling Nymeria and Lady), and Bran I believe will help in the defeat of the NK by having a battle of the minds with him (maybe even pull a Hold the Door 2.0 on the NK) weakening him, and I originally thought maybe Bran left a piece of himself in the NK while he was being turned and Bran will have to stab Catspaw in his heart to weaken the NK and while that is still possible, I believe it be a better twist if Bran lived to the end and went beyond the former wall to take his place as the 3ER.

- As for the Lannisters, Jaime &amp; Bronn will gather the Frey/Tully forces with Edmure and march North, I think they will save whomever is left after the surprise attack from the AOTD and Jaime will sacrifice himself saving Bran and/or Arya and die in the arms of the woman he loves Brienne (Bronn will die also), Tyrion will in my opinion live to the end and become Lord of Crownlands, open a Vineyard and finally finish that joke, Cersei will have her miscarriage and grow more mad and paranoid and with Harry Strickland and the GC changing sides she has Qyburn turn her into the Night Queen. But she will die at the hands of Arya via Catspaw to the chest (where the Dragonglass was put in) while she wraps her hand around her pale white throat.

- NK and WWs will be revealed that they are not just mindless monsters wanting to kill everything and that there is a reason for there return that even connects to the symbols they make (there return is a combination of Resurgence in Magic, Jons birth, Being threatened by the burning of Weirwoods by Red Priest, and wanting to end the curse the children put on them) 

- Jon being Lightbringer fights him 1v1 and Bran has a battle of the minds with him to distract/weaken him, its successful and with Sams help removes the Dragonglass from NKs chest, Making him die a mortal man, As the other WWs turn back human and all the Wights collapse.

- The Kingdoms will be made independent and in each one a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established after Iron Throne is melted down.

- Varys I think will be revealed to be more then he seems and it may involve him betraying Dany in the name of House Blackfyre, but will die in the end.

- House Greyjoy I think will go extinct with Theon being forced to put a tonguless Yara out of her misery, Damphair dying in Theons arms, and Theon dying killing Euron in the final battle.

- CLEGANEBOWL, Sandor wins but dies not long after too bloodlose. Also Beric gives Gendry the kiss of life.

- Sam and Gilly will become Lord and Lady of the Reach and the Bittersweet ending will be the war is one but at a great cost as many friends, family, and good people dead and Jon possibly lost another lover.

- Qyburn has fled Westeros and is never heard from again, he is presumed dead.

People who live: Jon, Bran, Arya, Brienne, Davos, Missendei, Qyburn, Hot Pie, Nymeria and her wolfpack, Gendry, Tyrion, Roslin and Edmures son, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, Robin, Lyanna Mormont, Harry Strickland, and Podrick.

People who die: Cersei, The Mountain, Varys, Sandor, Beric, Grey Worm, Tormund, Ghost, Yohn Royce, Ned Umber, Lord Glover, Alys Karstark, Jorah, Damphair, Theon, Yara, Euron, Mel, Sansa, Edmure, All of Danys dragons, Bronn, Jaime, Illyn Payne, and the NK.

I only make my predictions past off forshadowing from all seasons leading up to this. Now let's Begin:

- Dany will survive childbirth to twins but will die n battle and be turned into the Night Queen, and Jon will be forced to kill Dany the new Night Queen.

- Jon will like I said be forced to kill Dany (whom is now the Night Queen) and one of Jon's twin children is Lightbringer and could bring a long summer of fire and blood, So Jon makes a pact with the NK and he helps take the magic away from the baby (with Mel's possibly help).

- It's revealed Bran has a piece of himself left in the NK from trying to prevent his turning and Arya is forced to stab Bran in the heart to weaken the NK, Jon then stabs Longclaw right where his Dragonglass was placed killing him and all the Wights and WW's.

- Jon will melt down the Iron Throne and from a Proto-Democracy and rule the Seven kingdoms not because he wants to but because it will be his duty, Jon will also marry Sansa so his twin children can still have a mother.

- Bran will of course die in order to defeat the NK, But the NK's backstory will be revealed with him being more then just a monster.

- Mel will be executed after all is said and done with fire, Varys will also die at some point.

- Theon will die killing Euron and Yara will rule the Iron Islands, Arya will become Warden of the North and Lady of Winterfell, she will also marry Gendry who may or may not give up Legitimacy to take the stark name (though that may be alittle fan fictiony).

- Arya or Euron will kill Cersei but then when she raises as a Wight Jaime will kill her by putting Widow's Wail through her pale, white, throat. Jaime will die in the arms of Brienne, the Woman he loves. Brienne (possibly pregnant with Jaime's child though idk yet) will become Lady of Stormlands in memory of Renly.

- CLEGANEBOWL, Sandor will win and become Sansa's bodyguard. Bronn will also get his castle in the form of Highgarden but Sam will be lord of the Reach ruling from his ancestral home.

- The Golden Company will probably change sides but most of them will die off the AOTD, there leader Harry Strickland will probably take whatever is left back to Essos with him or they will stay to help rebuild. Daario (who I still think WILL return) will probably die from Jorah or one of Dany's dragons for betraying Dany.

- Ghost and all the dragons will be gone by the end.

- Tyrion becomes Lord of Westerlands and opens a Vineyard and Winery with Jorah

- Sam will write the Song of Ice and Fire. The Bittersweet ending will be Westeros is saved but at what cost as loved ones died, Jon lost another lover, and Westeros is left in ruins and must be rebuild.

People who die: Edd, Ghost, Tormund, Grey Worm, Edmure, Qyburn, Varys, Gilly, Davos, Yohn Royce, Pod, All of Dany's Dragons, Damphair, Euron, Theon, The Mountain, Cersei, Dany, Bran, Mel, and the NK.
