I know people are constantly complaining about their favorite characters dying and their hopes for the future being dashed, and you're all probably getting rather tired of it. I hope this observation is different enough from the rest to hold your interest and to keep within the rule that requires me to ""provide value to the subreddit.""  
  
Anyways, to the point. 
  
I didn't start watching the show until well into Season 2, when Reddit started really getting worked up over it. Found a nice source online and started watching. Loved it, of course. Why would I be here otherwise?  

The fantasy was refreshingly low: a (nearly) all-human, low-magic, real-tech universe without most of the earmarks of traditional high fantasy.  

The characters were refreshingly real: people with real traits driven by real motivations who-- perhaps the most realistically-- were almost all out for something completely unique.  

One of the things I'd heard was that *Game of Thrones* is a show that's not afraid to kill characters. I'd seen comments in various places about the concept, even if I hadn't seen the show.   
  
But I wasn't worried. Central characters have never been my favorites. It's not a choice, really. They're just never written in such a way that I get attached to them. Sure, I like Arya and Tyrion just like everyone else, but they're not the dearest to me.

So I watched with confidence that I wouldn't be as stricken by the show's reportedly numerous character deaths as were those *other Redditors*.  

As Season 1 started to gain momentum, I was most looking forward to scenes with four characters in particular: Petyr, Varys, Tywin, and Sandor. They were the most interesting to me and (at the time) they were safe. I don't know which of them are POV characters in the books, but in the show they were background.  
  
Now, don't get me wrong: anyone with eyes could see that most of them had real power to exercise. I'm not saying they were extras; it was abundantly clear that Petyr and Varys at least were being set up to be power players. All I'm saying is that they weren't Ned Stark. They weren't characters that I was being coaxed into believing were protagonists.  
  
*S1E09: ""Baelor""* rolls around and-- spoilers-- Ned Stark kicks it. Much rage is heard from those of us who, as I said, were tricked into believing that there's such a thing as ""plot armor"" in ASOIAF. Much smugness is had from those of you who made it through the first half of *a Game of Thrones* and had already learned that lesson. Hype is had on both sides.  
  
And following *Baelor,* named characters start dropping like flies. Everyone's favorites start dying. [This](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/1b/9e/d0/1b9ed0c665e738a4e1af92324d5417f3.jpg) picture becomes relevant.  
  
Well, we're reaching my conclusion here, which is this: what happens to tertiary characters when primary characters die?  
  
They become primary characters.  
  
And what happens to primary characters? Well, once again, picture relevant. And it took S4E10 for me to realize that. Two of my four straight-up snuff it, one right after the other, and a third (Varys) ends up just a little bit boned. And what about Petyr? What's he doing? Being a primary character, that's what he's doing. The fucking prick. Doesn't he know that's a death sentence? *Why would he do this?!*  
  
Yeah, yeah, Kittenclysm. Boo-hoo. Everyone you love is dead. Call the Waahmbulance. It's happened to everyone.  
  
But that's not my point. My point is that, without the luxury of pages and pages to tell GRRM's story, the show's writers have effectively conveyed at least one thing through the lens of theater. They brought to their audience at least one of the wider messages that *A Song of Ice and Fire* strives to tell. Even I-- a person who never got through a single one of the books-- can understand it now, and I feel that it tears at me the same that it tears at the rest of you.  
  
All men must die.

Meryn is still alive,  Syrio fought with his sword made of wood, so he just knocked down Meryn, as he did to the other guards (probably killing them in the process as you can hear Meryn being disarmed and the screams of the other guards in the room) and escaped.

And to the question why Meryn never said anything about that, we have got another potential answer: Meryn fears Cersei (in the second book with Tommen's case she almost wants him dead) so if he said that he failed to take Arya Stark and has been knocked out by a little man with a training sword, I don't think he would in the royal guard anymore.

This leads us to Seasonn 2 when Arya met Jaqen for the first time when she found him locked up with the two other criminals. And the way Jaqen looked after Arya when they both parted ways, it would make sense that that was actually Syrio (keeping his identity hidden).

Re-watching the earlier seasons, I'm convinced this is true.

To be clear, there's no question that a conflict over the throne was eventually inevitable, but the fact that it happened how it did, and involved as many people vying for a crown as it did, and especially its impact on the Stark family, is entire Catelyn's responsibility.

By capturing Tyrion on the Kingsroad, she started the war.  Period.  The all-powerful Lannisters retaliating was the only response that could have been expected by doing that, and she did it based on Baelish's claim about who owned a dagger.  It was a foolish basis for doing something so obviously cataclysmic, and [All Spoilers](#s ""she ultimately paid for it with her own life as well as the life of her husband, her first born, and scads of Northerners."")

And even if Tyrion had in fact been the one who had attempted to assassinate Bran, and even if she had incontrovertible proof that he did it, why would she make an enemy of the wealthy house that essentially ran King's Landing while her husband - who reluctantly went at her insistence - was at their mercy?  Not to mention her daughters.  It's an indefensible mistake in the sense that it puts her family at obvious risk to no benefit.  There were ways to seek her vengeance that might have actually been effective.  Instead she accomplishes nothing that serves her interests and sets off a devastating chain of events. 

Forget Ned's various failings at the game of realpolitik.  Once he stepped down as Hand, he told his men they were going home.  He was confronted by Jaime over Tyrion on his way out of the city, and takes credit for Tyrion's capture to protect his wife.  His men are killed and he's wounded in the leg, keeping him in the lion's den longer.  Catelyn is the reason Ned even had the opportunity to be a captive of the crown, and by extension the reason her son raises his banners.  No matter how nave Ned's behavior may have been, Cat's actions are what doom him in the first place.

People overplay Littlefinger's machinations.  Sure, he maliciously stirred the pot at every opportunity, but he could only add dynamite to the stack, not actually light it.  The fact that things panned out as chaotically as they did, to his delight, is something he can only take so much credit for.  It still required an actual act of war by someone stupid enough to commit it, and that was Cat.

[All Spoilers](#s ""If anything, Littlefinger delayed the war, because had Jon Arryn not been poisoned, he would have presumably gone to Stannis with the evidence.  Stannis would have still launched war against the Lannisters, but the fight would have come down to those who supported his claim versus those who supported Joffrey's, thus resulting in a much cleaner conflict that wouldn't have begun with half the Stark family captured before it even began.  Renly would have had less opportunity to try to take a stab at his own claim, Robb of course would have no reason to end up named King of the North, and it's even less likely Balon would have gotten involved."")

Capturing Tyrion was the inciting incident, and Cat made the call unilaterally.

77,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-10-3,2014,10,3,1,2i3on8,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS ALL - SEASON 5 SPECULATION] Jaime's role in the introduction of YG,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2i3on8/spoilers_all_season_5_speculation_jaimes_role_in/,hashbrohash,1412266820,"REMINDER: ""Spoilers All"" means ""All Books.""  You have been warned.

I've come up with a decent theory about Jaime's role in Dorne and how it could facilitate a smooth introduction of Aegon into the story.

I believe that this series of events will occur:

-Episode 1 or 2: En route to Dorne to deliver the Mountain's fake skull and probably also to kidnap Myrcella for Cersei, Jaime tells Bronn the Lannister-friendly version of the story the death of Elia and her children.  Jaime states that his story is biased, though, and feels remorse for the Martells and expresses disgust in the Mountain's actions during the Sack of King's Landing.  Jaime's story includes a firsthand account of seeing Aegon's head smashed in ""beyond recognition,"" which is a main reason behind his disgust in the Mountain.  He also states that he's quite worried about whether or not he will survive the trip, considering that, as a Lannister, the Martells will likely receive him with as little courtesy as they would had received Tywin or even the Mountain himself.

-Meanwhile, in Dorne, Myrcella, with the Martells, hears the news of Oberyn's death.  The Sand Snakes are less than thrilled, but Doran's opinion is impossible to read.  Soon after, over a game of cyvasse in the water gardens, Trystane asks Myrcella what she knows of the murder of Elia and her children.  Myrcella tells them a story very similar to Jaime's Lannister-friendly version.  Trystane tells Myrcella the Martell version of event (which is still a bit biased, but captures the brutal truth of the incident with far more accuracy than the Lannister version).  Aegon is described as having had his head smashed in ""beyond recognition.""  This happens probably a few scenes after Jaime's telling so as to make the similarities and differences of the two accounts very apparent.

-Meanwhile, Tyrion embarks upon his boat journey with Griff and Young Griff, after Varys and Illyrio enlist Tyrion to support the Targaryens for the throne rather than Stannis or Myrcella (without mentioning either Dany or Aegon by name).

-An episode later: Jaime arrives in Dorne.  He offers his condolences for Oberyn's death, which seem to be respected by Doran but are met with open contempt by the Sand Snakes.  He meets in private with Myrcella, who asks if what their family did to Elia and her children was true.  ""The boy, Aegon... they said the Mountain smashed his head beyond recognition...""  Jaime reveals that it is indeed true, and that Cersei and Tywin's telling of the event was a lie.  Jaime, who is seeking to restore his lost honor, thinks that perhaps he could right his past wrongs by helping the Martells in some way.

-An epiode later: Obara instigates a fight with Jaime.  What starts the fight?  Perhaps Obara tries to sell him on the Queenmaker plot, but Jaime fears that doing so will mean Cersei and Tommen will face the same fate that Elia and Aegon once met.  Other factors behind the fight would probably include revenge for Oberyn or Jaime's attempted kidnapping of Myrcella.  Both of them survive the fight (though Obara will surely perform better than Jaime).  In the wake of the fight, Jaime tells Obara that he was not at all happy about how the Sack of King's Landing went down.  He reveals that he supported Rhaegar, and recounts how Rhaegar, before riding to his death at the Ruby Ford, had told Jaime that ""there would be changes"" (i.e. Aerys would be replaced by Rhaegar) upon his return.  Jaime states that wishes that Rhaegar had returned.  He wishes that Rhaegar was still king, Elia was still queen, and Aegon was still his prince.

-Meanwhile, in Essos: Tyrion deduces that Young Griff is in fact the lost Prince Aegon, who is beginning his own campaign to retake the Iron Throne.

That would be a very satisfying way to introduce Aegon to the story.  This would be a bit less jarring than how it happened in the books, and it wouldn't leave show watchers confused as to who Aegon is in the first place.  

It would also set up intriguing changes to the Queenmaker plot (especially if Aegon doesn't actually end up making it onto the show at all), and it would introduce more tension into Jaime and Cersei's relationship, which I know some book readers are yearning for.

I love the ""non-cowardly Falstaff"" persona he gives the character.  Certainly it comes from the books, but he really brings it to life.

Robert is such a comic figure and yet also such a tragic one, doomed and consciously incompetent as a king.  Like Ned, he's not a fool in a general sense but rather someone who's completely out of his arena in the political landscape.  When he speaks wistfully about the war you can't help but imagine how badass he must have been in his prime, waving his massive war hammer, and when he speaks of Lyanna you can't but pity him a bit.

No punches are pulled when it comes to his uglier qualities, and yet for all of them I always come away liking the fat, restless loudmouth and feeling saddened by his fateful inability to adjust from conqueror to ruler.

She's never read the books or seen the show, and doesn't know much about it except that Sean Bean dies in the first season. But, she has a degree in film studies and is a self-described professional TV watcher who watches more television than any person I know. 

So, we started watching season 1. She's asking me lots of questions trying to grasp all the characters and their relationships. She immediately picks up on the references to Ned Stark's sister and I explained to her a little of the backstory about Rhaegar, Lyanna, and Robert's rebellion. 

Then, about 20 minutes into just Episode 2, after Jon Snow leaves for the Wall and Ned tells him ""you are ~~not~~ a Stark, you may not have my name but you have my blood,"" she asks me, ""Are we going to find out that Jon Snow is not actually Sean Bean's son but the son of his sister? Maybe with Mark Addy, or maybe by the guy who kidnapped her? Sean Bean doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would cheat on his wife.""

Blew my mind. I told her that her guess is as good as mine, that it's one of the most popular and compelling fan theories but that, if it is true, GRRM hasn't even written that far yet. But, I couldn't believe she came up with that on her own just 20 minutes into S01E02. She is like a television-watching savant. Maybe it's just me, but I never considered that theory until much later after I read about it.

Here's the way I think it'll pan out: The Meereen storyline will continue as per the books (Daznak's Pit, the battle of Slaver's Bay, etc). However, when the Iron Fleet shows up, it's not led by Victarion, but by Balon. What's more, it turns out (and this is where it gets tinfoily) Daario is actually Euron Greyjoy, who was sent by Balon to win Daenerys' trust so that once the Ironborn fought off the slavers for her she would form an alliance with them to conquer Westeros. From there, Balon will mention in passing that Theon is either dead or unable to further the Greyjoy line and that Daario/Euron is now Balon's heir, at which point Euron kills Balon to become King of the Iron Islands. I know that the tinfoil here is off the charts and that there are some holes in the theory (how did Balon know about Daenerys and her dragons? How did Daario/Euron come to be a lieutenant of the Second Sons in the time between Balon learning of Daenerys and her march on Yunkai?) but I think it elegantly deals with some uncast characters, introduces a major plot twist, and of course also actually confirms that crazy theory that Daario = Euron",5,0,False,self,,,,,

So I'm kinda confused about the Many-faced god. Can someone ELI5 the whole Faceless men temple, the people there and the faceless men to me? I want to sort my questions but I keep writing and deleting them because they sound so confusing &amp; stupid when reading them. I don't get who's the Faceless men, are they the assassins, or are they the men in the temple? Are those the same things? Do they serve the many-faced god(assassins), then why does Jaqen believe the Red god.

Also I didn't quite get the first part with the skeleton Arya kisses.

And does the kind man keep asking ""who are you"" because you HAVE to be ""no one"" to serve the many faced god?


About Myrcella, I don't get what's making her a queen going to do. Arianne says she wants to crown her, but what does that mean, will she be the queen of Dorne when she's crowned? How does that benefit Arianne exactly? So she wants to rule Dorne and she wants people to know it's her birthright to rule since she's the older sibling, right? But isn't that how Dorne works *already?* And how does crowning Myrcella going to do anything about that really, it'd just make the Lannisters more powerful, no?


Please excuse me if the questions sound stupid, I'm just overwhelmed a bit on my first read of AFFC",8,3,False,self,,,,,

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

I couldn't have asked for a better ending, with the exception of poor little Podrick Payne. Brienne's death is regrettable, though if she was too dumb to simply lie to LSH and promise to kill Jaime she could've gotten out of there alive.

I cannot say how pleased I am with Cersei's downfall, Jaime's complete lack of concern for the crazy cheating bitch, and how his goals fit in nicely with Pycelle and Swyft and their idea of how things should go forward in Kings Landing. Allowing the Faith to revive the Sons and Stars was obviously the dumbest thing she could have possibly done and now her crimes are coming back to bite her in the ass.

I'm not a Danaerys fanboy, but it's pretty awesome how Doran's plans coincide nicely with Archmaester Marwyn's plan to reach her while the Ironmen are also trying to get to Slaver's Bay. So many crazy awesome things happening at once! Should make for nice plot development in ADWD. 

And on top of all of this, Littlefingers little matchmaking scheme between Harry the Heir and 'Alayne' and his reference to ""three queens"" makes me believe he intends to make Sansa queen of all Westeros. Not sure how all that fits in with his creepy ass pedophile obsession with kissing her all the time and undoubtedly wanting her for himself, and to make himself king of Westoros I can only imagine. I just don't see Peter Baelish settling for being Lord Paramount of the Trident and Hand of the Queen. Seeing how these plans collide with the Danaerys storyline and all her supporters (which I'm positive includes Varys {and by extension maybe even Tyrion} for obvious reasons when you consider the Arya chapter in the dungeons from AGOT) should make for an unbelievably awesome showdown.

But I do have a couple questions if someone could help me out without spoiling ADWD.... First of all, am i correct in concluding that the shady as fuck wizard guy in the prologue was actually Archmaester Marwyn? If so, why would he have needed the other Archmaester's key?",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Now if you don't quite understand why this is worth mentioning then let me remind those of you who have forgotten or those of you who didn't know that Tywin Lannister's deceased wife was called Joanna Lannister, making for an interesting casting choice.

Another point to make is Dance and Haythorn divorced in 2004, and Tywin lost Joanna during childbirth...

The side of the book with the title and author's name on the other hand doesn't seem to be easily damaged. It's still a golden material, but is more durable than the front cover.

I'm a bit irritated here that this book costs $35 in the hard copy and yet you cant even hold the cover normally because it will get ruined. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience. If so than I advise avoiding the hard copy as it seems to be a complete waste of money compared to other editions.

So at the end of S04E10 we get to see Tyrion stumble upon Shae in his father's chambers and it is apparent that she is having an affair with Tywin. However her motives are left somewhat unclear to me. The part that I don't get is how and when this affair is implied to have started and whether or not Shae's feelings for Tyrion were genuine at all. So would someone answer some of these questions for me:

1.Did Shae really love Tyrion or was it just for the money?

2.Was she just using him until he kicked her and then she needed a new patron - Tywin?

3.Was she approached by either Cersei or Tywin to betray Tyrion and testify against him or did she volunteer herself to do it? 

4.Was Shae  maybe working for Tywin all along and was only with Tyrion so that Tywin could have a way to spy on his son while Tyrion was the acting Hand of the King?

Basically did Shae get with Tywin for emotional reasons (to sort of spite Tyrion, even though he wouldn't know) or practical ones? Or maybe a little bit of both?

Also, on another note, doesn't having an affair with Shae make Tywin somewhat of a hypocrite seeing as how he always chastised Tyrion for his constant whoring.",15,15,False,self,,,,,

And the other major houses left remaining have to actually fight together to win, until dany and her dragons come. 

Or something like that. I would just like to see the massive flooding/humanity doomed thing",29,6,False,self,,,,,

Now, I would like to share my enjoyment of this wonderful universe with some other people, namely my parents.

My parents are a bit conservative, they like to watch corny Chinese dramas and though I doubt they've seen anything like game of thrones I seriously believe they would enjoy quality television regardless of the language barrier.
However, I'm a bit nervous that the amount of explicit content (the sexual bits especially), might be a bit much for them. I'm afraid they might be put off by the sometimes extremely graphic surface elements before they truly get to experience the complex story-line and fascinating characters.

Is there a censored version of GoT? Something that tones down the sexual and perhaps violence aspects down a notch. A version that cut out a scene now and again that isn't absolutely essential to understanding the story. I'll eventually suggest they watch the ""true"" version to get the full enjoyment, but right now I'm worried I might scare them off before I get to hook em in.",28,11,False,self,,,,,

So there's a passage I was reading and it's been discussed in /r/asoiaf but I wanted to both give it exposure over here and get this subs feedback.
Mostly everything is from either AGOT or has been seen in the show already. The two references to ADWD aren't terribly important and just add slightly to the theories.

What I'm talking about is AGOT Bran 3 [here]( http://m.imgur.com/a/117Ep), specifically the highlighted section. (It runs over from pic one to two).

For context this is right before Bran wakes up from his coma and he has a dream where he is falling and he can see things happening all over the world. Here he is looking at his Father, Sansa, and Arya. He says he sees shadows all around them and then describes 3. The first two seem pretty straightforwardly Sandor Clegane and Jaime Lannister. The third at first glance is Gregor Clegane. He is literally a giant, darkness and  thick black blood would mean his general evilness or [S4](#s ""Oberyn's poison and whatever Qyburn does to him"") / [ADWD](#b ""Robert Strong foreshadowing"") and the armor made of stone a reference to his nickname the mountain.

Two other possibilities that I like a little more:

1. Tyrion: there are multiple multiple references to Tyrion casting a large shadow. Armor made of stone I took to mean either Casterly Rock (as Tyrion recently talked about people not being able to hurt him because he's a Lannister) or [ADWD](#b ""the fact that he may have greyscale""). The thick black blood presents a problem though. He's not totally moral but he's not evil like Gregor. As well as being GRRM's favorite character so it seems unlikely he'd be described that way.

2. Littlefinger: [S4](#s "" He's orchestrated basically everything that happened up until this point in the books. Lysa poisoning John Arryn and having her send the Starks a letter saying the Lannisters did it and setting all of this in motion. Making him sort of a giant""). For his armor made of stone, his grandfather was from Braavos and originally picked the Sigil of house Baelish to be the Titan of Bravos (which was on of the first images I got from a giant in armor made of stone). And again Thick black blood a reference to his evilness.

Overall it doesn't seem like the Mountain, he just isn't as important as Jaimie and the Hound are throughout the series. If I had to pick I'll say he's referencing Littlefinger.

This is really a great chapter all together.

So speculate away and feel free to critique.",12,3,False,self,,,,,

I've heard it mentioned that in the ASOIAF story, the seasons use to be regular THOUSANDS of years ago until a preternatural event changed it. So if there even is a reason according to GRRM, I think it would be this.

The planet of Ice and Fire is in a binary star system. The seasons changed because a second star came along and disrupted the single star and its planets. You would have to give me a little creative license here and assume that somehow nobody in Westeros or Essos can see the second sun, or at least they cannot see both of them at the same time.

Which is, as posted, the whole show and the books up to book 3 A Storm of Swords. Not sure of the relevance since this post is dealing more with ancient history and so should not be a spoiler for anyone really.**

The Targaryens, traditionally marry Brother to Sister, and carry their bloodline forward as ""pure"" as they can. We know their line has birthed bastards as early as Lord Aerion, father to Aegon the Conqueror and (rumored) Orys Baratheon, the progenitor of the Baratheon household.

But how far back can we find reports of Targaryen madness?

Baelor the Blessed who Refused to eat to rid himself of sin? Perhaps, but he was without issue, so he could not have passed on any genetic deviances.

What about Aerion Targaryen, or Aerion Brightflame, Aerion the Monstrous who drank wildfire claiming it would turn him into a Dragon.     
He was never king though, and this happened after he returned from a lengthy banishment to Lys, and during a drunken night at a Tavern in Westeros.     
But certainly fit the profile, Sadistic with Delusions of Grandeur.     

The same which can be said for Aerys the II or the Mad king. Same pattern, Sadistic behavior and Delusions of Grandeur. He also believed he could be turned into a Dragon, in his case by a conflagration of fire.

Indeed it was his own Father, King Jaehaerys II who coined the term: 

**""Madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.""**

So what was the cause, inbreeding? There certainly was a lot of that, but at this point in time the bloodline had seen its share of pollution as well.

Aerys II was the son a of non Targaryen woman as his father had married for love, taking after his own father Aegon V who did the same.

Indeed no sign of Targaryen madness is recorded early on in the Targaryen reign, when they exclusively married their own, or the close bastard houses Baratheon and Velaryon.

Indeed it wasn't until Viserys I married Aemma of the house Arryn, a traditional Andal family (though she was the grandaughter of a Targaryen) that we see the first hints of madness in his issue and unintended successor Aegon II, who took the throne for his own in rebellion against his older Sister sparking the ""Dance of the Dragons"" civil war. They were also the grandparents of Ageon the unworthy, whose actions caused the Blackfyre rebellion.

And it was Daeron II who married Myriah Martell and begat Baelor the Blessed. Who might not fit the Pattern of Sadism, but perhaps Masochism in his case, though the Delusions of Grandeur can certainly be argued. Lets not also forget that Baelor appointed an 8 year old to high septim, believing he had miraculous powers.


Does anyone with more knowledge them me on this subject have something to add here? Is there some reason, beyond what we might know at this time why the Targaryens found it necessary to preserve their bloodline through inbreeding in the first place?`    
Perhaps some magical connection in their history to Dragons. After all we know GRRM likes to take inspiration from real world history and there are examples there of people maintaining inbreeded lines as a holy commandment.

**TL;DR** - Should I say something to my gf to sort of ""mentally prepare"" her before watching this episode? If so, any suggestions?

I've watched the entire series as it airs, but I've been rewatching it all with my gf to catch her up before season 5. Let's just say she's more emotionally affected by this show than I was my first time watching it. She's invested in the characters and really does enjoy the show, but she can get really sad after certain things happen (convincing her to stick with the show after the first episode ended with Bran being pushed out a window was hard enough).

I'm worried if I let her go into The Red Wedding blindly it may put her off from the show entirely, or at least for a period of time. Do you think I should preface the episode with some sort of warning? Or should I let her suffer like the rest of us did the first time watching it?

I remember in one episode Jon said something along the lines of ""if they get past the wall, they will ravage the land for a thousand miles before they meet an army that can stop them"". 

Is the big deal just how much chaos and damage they could cause before they could be stopped (a thousand miles is a very long distance)? Also that they are more unpredictable than the armies of the seven kingdoms because they have no lords or land? Is the hundred thousand men Mance has the majority of the wilding population?

* Lady Stoneheart
* Griff &amp; Young Griff
* Victarion, possibly Euron
* Arianne + conspirators
* Quentyn
* Jeyne Poole/fArya
* Penny
* Moqorro

Now, I've heard convincing arguments about cutting some of these plots out entirely or having them consolidated into other story lines. While I can see how this could be done for a few of them, I cannot bring myself to believe they would cut out ALL of this. They would completely ruin the integrity of the story line in an unprecedented way. Yeah, they've made changes before, such as the Tysha thing, but I think they were able to compensate for that by changing Shae's character. And besides, the main events of Tyrion's last chapters were kept pretty faithfully.

But to take out the Griffs? Then what would be the point of Tyrion's story until he gets sold into slavery? What about Varys and Illyrio, are they going to make them loyal to Dany or include someone else? Illyrio saying he expected Dany to die in the Dothraki sea was one of the biggest revelations in the last two books imo. It completely changes the way we see the events in Dany's life before the dragons hatched. Especially with Arianne's released chapter from TWOW showing that both her and the Griffs will feature prominently in the book, how could they just cut out all of it? 

And then there's Quentyn and Victarion. I don't see why D&amp;D would choose to exclude two story lines that 1. provide epic dragon/battle scenes and 2. make the Meereen story line much more interesting, which I know is a huge complaint from both book readers and show watchers. Plus I'm assuming the horn is going to feature prominently in the upcoming Battle of Meereen. Quentyn's death could make for some genuinely emotional scenes, also. 

Cutting out Lady Stoneheart makes Brienne and Jaime's arc pointless, unless they can come up with something better. But see, that's what I don't get. It's one thing to cut out extraneous or boring material for the sake of fitting everything into 10 episodes, but that's not what cutting these characters out would do. This would literally be changing the direction of at least a third of the overall plot. And I've heard suggestions that maybe the lack of casting indicates that these characters won't be relevant for much longer in the books, but I'm not sold on that. (f)Aegon, in my opinion, was the biggest twist of the last two books and a complete game-changer even if he is just a ""red herring."" 

Given the fact that they already have to write new story lines for Bran and Sansa, it just seems like so much more work on D&amp;D's part to completely remove or change these plots. And when TWOW comes out, they will have to further change everything to accommodate all the foundational stuff from AFFC/ADWD they took out. It seems so much easier to take the major plot points as they are and cut out details when necessary. It's not even like these are boring plots. Vengeful zombie Catelyn, Myrcella getting cut, Quentyn's dragon debacle, Victarion's ""fuck you"" to Euron + the dragon horn, Rhaegar's (possible) son being alive (!!!). This stuff would be exciting for even the least critical show watchers. 

I have stood behind D&amp;D for most of the changes they've made this far. Yeah, the Cersei and Jaime rape scene was not cool, and I would have preferred the inclusion of Tysha, but at the end of the day it seems like they've been making a sincere effort to stay true to the books. So my question is, are we sure that they're really going to do this? I just cannot for the life of me conceive that they would screw up this badly. ",50,19,False,self,,,,,

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

Bear with me, as this is my first post on this sub. I've been lurking for a while and haven't seen this mentioned before.  
  
  
So here it goes... Many readers have been disappointed by the omission of **Lady Stoneheart** in the season 4 finale and it has been speculated that she might not make it into the show at all. However I have a possible explanation for this omission, and why it might still happen...  
  
As most readers seem to believe, I too beleive **Jon Snow's death** at the hands of his 'brothers' will not be a permanent one. I tend to agree with the theory that Melisandre will revive him in order to fulfill her prophecy.  
  
  
Having said that, I think the showrunners have decided not to reveal LSH yet in order to make Jon's death more impactful (Are they planning to make this the final scene of Season 5 ?). Otherwise, once again assuming the Jon resurrection theory is correct, it might be too obvious to show watchers that Jon would get the same treatment Catlyn had. They might still include LSH in the show but it is unlikely it will happen during season 5.
  
  
Any thoughts ?  
  
  
**tl;dr** : LSH was omitted from Season 4 so Jon's fate stays uncertain to show watchers.

I'm rewatching the series with my girlfriend, she's a newbie, and in the episode where Tyrion meets Shae, they play a drinking game along with Bronn. Tyrion guesses that Bronn has been beyond the wall, which is true according to Bronn. Shae asks what brought him there, and he simply says ""work."" 

What do you think brought him there? Normal sellsword stuff? Smuggling? How often do sellswords get up beyond the wall? There's no chance I should don my tinfoil cap and imagine he was one a crow or a wildling, right? 

Also, on shae: this series is amazing. There's even a hint to her treachery later on in the first episode she's in. Tyrion tells the story of Taesha, and she says ""you should've known she was a whore."" He says he was young and stupid, and she says ""you're still young and stupid."" What else would she mean if not that Tywin is playing the same trick on him again? And of course we know what happens later. Great stuff from the writers.",21,36,False,self,,,,,

I've included more assumptions in brackets but please feel free to dispute. Also, many characters are missing. 

1. Barristan Selmy 
2. Robert Baratheon (during rebellion)
3. Jamie Lannister (with hand)
4. Rhaegar Targaryen
5. Eddard Stark
6. Brienne of Tarth
7. Tywin Lannister
8. Gregor Clegane
9. Grey Worm
10. Bronn
11. Oberyn Martell
12. Sandor Clegane

Allow me to defend my rankings:

1. Barristan has won more 1v1 duels than any other character. Plus, you don't obtain leader of Kingsguard without being one of the best.

2. Robert was a formidable fighter back in his day. He killed Rhaegar, who was also an exceptional fighter, as reflected in his lower ranking. Robert's death was merely a matter of him becoming a complacent king, as reflected in his death as a result of hunting. Note how many other characters also speak of Robert's fighting prowess, including Tywin.

3. When Jamie had his hand, he never lost. When he and Eddard fought in the first season, the fight was very close, but was ended early. The reason Jamie lost to Brienne on the bridge was because both of his hands were tied together. This justification shows just how close the rankings are though! With a bit of luck, a lower ranking character can kill a higher ranking character, although I've tried to factor luck into attitude.

4. Rhaegar was a boss. Although he was royalty and most male characters in a royal family are among the best fighters in the realm, Rhaegar was a bit of a pretty boy. However, one day he decided that he wanted to learn how to fight, and he became a deciding factor during Robert's rebellion.

5. Eddard was a good fighter. I doubt he could have beat Robert, since Robert became king, and I doubt he could've killed Rhaegar. Won't find out though. I'm fairly certain he could beat any of the characters ranked below him, including Tywin. The only reason Ned died after Tywin is because he got politically outplayed.

6. Brienne is a wildcard. She seems to deal with everyone she fights flawlessly, and even disarms The Hound very early in their fight, as reflected in the large disparity in their rankings. The only reason that fight was so close is because The Hound fought without honor. I wouldn't be surprised if she could beat Tywin.

7. Tywin seems to be a good fighter in large-scale fights, but I have never seen him fight in a 1v1. I believe he could beat The Mountain though.

8. The Mountain is a good example of braun not being enough. Yes, he is very strong and kills many men, but he gets killed by The Red Viper, who is ranked lower than him. I'll explain this later.

9. I have not seen Grey Worm fight in a 1v1 either. He does well when Daenerys takes Yunkai, and also volunteers to fight the champion of Meereen. He was also picked as the leader of the legendary Unsullied. I doubt he could kill any of the people ranked above him in a 1v1 though.

10. Although Bronn is undefeated, he only picks fights that he knows he can win. One could argue that this makes him a top fighter in the realm, but he has never fought anyone more skilled than a regular knight.

11. If it weren't for his cockiness, I would rank The Red Viper near the top. His attitude gets him killed, and I'm fairly certain that he would've met the same demise against any of the other characters that are ranked higher. (i.e. gain significant upper hand but end up getting smoked) I had a tough time deciding where to rank him because of this.

12. Think of The Hound as a weaker version of his brother. Yes, he is a good fighter, but he fights without honor and does not fight people that are very skilled. Plus, he is killed by Brienne.

Other comments:

- In my opinion Jorah Mormont is not a good fighter. I would rate him as a better-than-average knight, but for that I would have to create a second tier of fighters.

- Daario Naharis and Jaqen H'gaar aren't here because they employ very sneaky tactics that likely wouldn't work against highly ranked characters, but given the fact that they are from Bravos, they could well be among the best (same with Syrio Forel).

- Jon Snow is a good fighter who has never lost either, and has actually killed some very vicious Wildlings, but I doubt he would stand a chance against any of the characters mentioned above. Again, second tier needed.

- Brandon Stark uses magic and could probably decimate any of the characters above once he masters his abilities, but this list concerns physical 1v1 fights with or without weapons.

E: damn guys! Go easy on me :( After reading the comments, here are some changes that I completely agree with (also bear in mind that I have not read the books, I just started the first one):

1. Ned and Tywin shouldn't be on the list. Their skill comes from leadership, not combat.

2. The Clegane brothers should be higher up. Much higher up.

3. Oberyn should be higher up as well. Thinking about it now, he could very well be in the top 4 or 5, but lost only because of who he was fighting.

4. Loras and Stannis should be on this list, replacing Ned and Tywin.

5. This list doesn't do the best job of factoring in several things:
- Dirty vs. clean (e.g. Hound vs. Loras)
- Primitive vs. modern (Drogo could be on this list if this factor was ignored)
- Natural counters (e.g. Viper vs. Mountain)
- Trickiness (Bravosi fighters)
- Environment (i.e. if north of Wall then Qhorin could be on list)

6. This list is flawed, please forgive! Thanks for giving your suggestions, the one I like best so far is from /u/barbasol1099

He was telling a story about how he received a letter from a female reader who shared with him how sad she is that all the characters who she grew to love slowly died one after another and that she can't read the books anymore because of that. He responded that he can understand that she feels that way but he wants to tell the story exactly how he envisions it in his mind and that maybe the books just aren't for her then. (At least that's how remember it) I think it's super important for an author or artist to stay true to himself, which is why I want to use that quote in particular.

So here it is! Winds of Winter Expansion for 10 players for the Game of Thrones the Board Game. It's all begun when I found Pypoks version of Winter Winds for 9 players and I thought it would be great to play the Game of Thrones on so monstrous level. (http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/13tjdv/game_of_thrones_9_player_board_game/ ) I planned to make it but then I realized I would change this ability and this image and ended in making my own version for 10 players. I worked with Pypoks files so youll note his signature on some files which I didn't change in any way. Secondly those beautiful images on cards, screens are not mine (I only changed some of them to fit my imagination from books - some eye colours, heraldry, bigger boar :D ).




The game is partially based on theories and some things (like Jon) are just speculation. However I though that it would be nice to have 10th player and have some wildlings running around, so here it is.





There is a IV deck which I changed a bit from Pypok's version. I also made up some new rules. First thing are Alliances which enable two players to win together and enter each others territory, but it also increases the paranoia and bacstab-risk between them (Lets enjoy the Tyrell x Lannister feeling you know from the story). Second thing is Hand of King which is a token given by Iron Throne holder to one player at the beginning of each round. Choose the right player and youll become much stronger, choose the wrong one and you are in big troubles. Youll also find deck VI (Fire and Blood) which is meant to be played with Hand and Alliances expansons. However these two expansions doesnt have to be played together or at all. Its your choise.





Here is the link:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/362sygyu5og5ske/AAAhyapjumDRbTo40VwVbt6Ra?dl=0





I changed several things in the south when compared to Pypok's version (which was playetested and was relatively balanced) Specifically: I added some islands, added some buffer territories between Aegon and Martell (which seemed to me and felt too tight as well from what I read) and finally I deleted one of Lannisters castles - Tumblestone (they wrote that Lannister was a bit stronger than others, and I think that this was a bit too much castles at one place). That should be all in the south.






The major change is in the North where I added Jon's house so it's almost completely reworked. Well North is BIG, so I wanted to represent it somehow so there is relatively large amount of territories. I was unsure whether it's not gonna worsen the momentum in the North, but I think that it'll work. One reason is that Jon's house cards are very mobile. Second is that Greyjoy will push into these territories as well (and will seriously threaten Baratheon's supply). North will be definetely somehow slower because of the distances, but there is large amount of conflict zones with great importance (Winterfell, Deepwood, White Harbour, Moat Cailin) which should maintain momentum and players just won't be able to sit and camp around in trenches. 






Last problem is Greyjoy. I worsened his position by placing Stronghold into Twins instead of Seagard. But I created very strong position on sea for him. Now he can attack very easily whole western coast from Tyrell to Baratheon (or maybe even Jon) and he has very good House cards for sea as well. So while I limited his mustering capability I greatly strenghtened his agresivity on sea. It's somehow assymetrical, but I don't think that it limits his chances for victory. 






Neither the game nor new rules have been playtested yet, but I'm gonna try to make the game as soon as possible (Im looking forward to playing it :D). However I like to hear some feedback and suggestions before printing it .  Im interested in your  ideas so if you find any problem, something you feel that is not gonna work or something to improve then write me right here and I'll think about it.

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

 BRIENNE: More or less.
 
 SEPTON MERIBALD:  More less than more.  There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds.  A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same.  The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord.  They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves.  Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous.  Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war.  Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a  maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide.  Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends.  They've heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win.  War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.
 
Then they get a taste of battle.

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first.  Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they've been gutted by an axe.

They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now.  They take a wound, and when that's still half-healed they take another.  There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be.  They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize.  They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground.  And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world...

And the man breaks.

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide.  All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours.  The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man.  Lady Brienne is not wrong.  In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them...  but he should pity them as well.

This time we tackle the ""fan chosen"" ""Valar Morghulis"" dubbel that was just released, so lets get going. Though if you would like to check out the reviews of the last 3 beers in the series you can check them out here...

[Iron Throne Blonde](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ak5ui/iron_throne_blonde_ale_review_from_a_beer_nut/)


Unlike the previous reviews, as I mentioned that this particular beer was ""fan chosen"", that at about the same time the last beer (Fire and Blood Red) was released Brewery Ommegang hosted a poll on their Facebook Page offering fans to choose from 4 styles (A Dubbel, a Tripel, and two different types of Quadrupels), all of which are trademarks of Belgian brewing, and the fans chose the Dubbel ale.  However Brewery Ommegang is somewhat known already for offering a Dubbel, their ""Abbey Ale"", the flagship beer for their brewery.  So when the fans chose the dubbel, and in heading into this review my biggest concern was that this new GoT tie in would be too similar to their ""Abbey Ale"" to justify the brewery going out of their way, so is it different enough?  Yes...I believe so, I did not do a side by side tasting of this to judge, and it's been a while since I had the ""Abbey Ale"" but I have had that beer enough times to judge where ""Valar Morghulis is different, and I will mention that a few time going into the review proper..

ABV: 8%, 750ml (Bomber) poured into a ""Game of Thrones"" Tulip (The glass that was sold along side the ""Take the Black Stout""), you can view my pour.. [HERE](https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10516825_4715624424859_6163805073762244068_n.jpg?oh=54a4ff6000450ac6ddba80c2c15eae54&amp;oe=54EC3C17&amp;__gda__=1425344917_e43a3b2d1b2a22050defb8f32d5cbc32)


First off this beer pours a deep mahogany brown with a light tan head, and unlike the ""Abbey Ale"" their is very little yeast sediment visible floating in the beer.  The aroma of the beer is typical of the style, dominated by dark fruits (cherries, plum, rasins ) and the breadyness of Ommegangs trademark yeast, both of which were apparent upon first sip as the dominating flavors present in the beer.  But unlike the ""Abbey Ale"" the Valar Morghulis I found to be a bit more dry, and slightly more bitter.  Other reviews I have read on this beer mention a hint of pepper in the beer, though I myself could not pick up on.  One of the most distinguishing things about the beer was the boozyness presented on the back end of a swallow, and unlike the Abbey Ale (even being of slightly higher alcohol content) which hides its alcohol a bit better, the alcohol is a bit more forward here giving the beer a bit of warmth like you would expect from an American Strong Ale, or a Winter Warmer.  It's not overly apparent, but it helps distinguish this beer from it's regular dubbel counterpart.  Overall the beer was a strong representative of what to expect of this classic Belgian style, I still prefer their regular ""Abbey Ale"", but I am glad that this was different enough to warrant a purchase...

Before I give my final score, I want to give a few tips or recommendations of how a craft beer novice should approach this beer, and make some recommendations of other beers of this style that might be more affordable or approachable. First of all, the most important thing I can say about opening a bottle of ""Valar Morghulis"" is to LET THE BEER WARM UP before drinking it.  I admit, in going into my bottle I got a bit antsy and started drinking right after pulling it out of the refrigerator, drinking a beer that cold will not allow you to enjoy all the flavors and nuances present in the beer.. and this beer got remarkably better as it warmed up.   This rule is true of any darker beer, but I think it is very important in any kind of strong Belgian style.  Lastly off all the GoT tie-in beers this beer is the least approachable of the four that Brewery Ommegang has released thus far, Belgian style beers are Ommegang's bread&amp;amp;amp;butter don't get me wrong, but for those who are not overly into craft beer might find ""Valar Morghulis"" out of their comfort zone.   So on that end I can offer one small tip before you blow $9 on a beer you may not like, try a few singles of other dubbles out there and see if you like it, one beer in particular I can recommend is New Belgium Brewing's (The makers of Fat Tire) ""Abbey Ale"", a very good dubbel with a lower ABV, but very faithful to the style, much more approachable, and much more cheap ($8 for a 6-pack).  I have been referring to it throughout this whole review, but Ommegang's regular Abbey Dubbel is also worth trying, and unlike the ""Valar Morghulis"" the Abbey ale is available in 12oz bottles of which most grocery stores, or bottle shops will break up and sell as singles which you can get for $2-$3 depending where you shop, I would recommend trying one of those before investing in the $9 750ml bomber if you are unsure of the style.  

In closing, I enjoyed this beer very much.. Not as much as the Fire and Blood Red ale, but this nudges in right behind that in terms of ranking the GoT tie-in beers.   I don't see myself buying a second bottle, as I prefer Ommegang's standard dubbel, but this beer was well worth the investment to try.   It is far away from the best representative of the dubbel style. (You would have to go to the Trappist breweries for that), but overall a really enjoyable beer, pick up a bottle if any of this sounds appealing to you.  This is the last ""scheduled"" GoT tie-in beer, though the brewery has said they wish to continue the relationship with HBO and produce more tie-ins... I hope this is the case, but nothing official has been stated as of yet.. So for now I hope you have enjoyed my series of beer reviews, have a good day, and drink good beer..

The two of us are crazy about game of thrones - our wedding in 12 weeks' time has lots of GoT in it, including red details (red wedding!), the best man is wearing a hand of the king pin, we're using robb and talisa's vows and I've made a House themed table plan! We're even considering playing Rains of Castamere during the evening reception just for laughs....

I've been trying to figure out what to get my SO for a wedding present. I want something really special that will blow him away - and I was thinking of maybe contacting Sean Bean or Peter Dinklage for signed photos? He's got a serious man crush on Ned Stark and thinks Tyrion is one of the best characters in TV history so I think he would love signed photos from the actors! Only thing is, I have no idea how to do this. Do any of you know how I would contact them? Do you think I've got time to sort this?

Also if this is not possible, do you know of any cool GoT stuff that I could get him? Maybe a painting or some kind of collectible?

I wonder how some of the characters alive currently will be seen a few hundred years from now. Will Walder Frey, for instance, be condemned as an awful villain? Or will history forget the whole salt-and-bread thing and see him as akin to Lann the Clever, as a man who used trickery to achieve his aims? Lann seems to be admired, rather than shunned. 

Rhaegar, to pick another example, has been gone less than two decades, and already it's difficult to disentangle fact from legend.

So I've decided to open a more official sigil request thread for me to pick away at while I binge watch Kitchen Nightmares.

**WHAT YOU GET**

* 250x250 pixel sigil.
* Your house words written in my chicken scratch.
* Overly complex sigils or mottos will be modified for the benefit of the piece.
* I will attempt to stay as close to your original idea as possible.

**GUIDELINES**

* Provide a brief description of the animal, insect, item or images of your sigil.
* Your motto. Please do not exceed five words.
* Name your House colour(s) to emblazon your crest on top of.
* Joke submissions are allowed but will probably be ignored. Each sigil takes somewhere between 15-40 minutes depending on complexity, in this particular instance I'd prefer spending the time on a genuine personal symbol.
* In interest of time and fairness, limit of one sigil per person.
* Commonly requested sigil symbols may start to be recycled and recoloured to save time.

I hope to be working on these for the rest of the night and into tomorrow, so don't feel shy to comment even if you're late!

**DISCLAIMER: Even in the original thread I did not get to all of the sigils despite the current count nearing thirty. I'm going to do my best to do as many as I can, sorry to anyone who misses out! If this goes over well, I may one day do a redux.**",81,18,False,self,,,,,

However I cannot remember seeing anything official on how this sub will handle submissions regarding TWOIAF.  I know /r/ASOIAF has prepared for the release by updating their spoiler tags, but I have not seen any word of adjustment for here.  So how will or how should this sub great TWOIAF?

I am more specifically referring to on what spoiler scope any ""new"" material from the book be treated. As this book will encompass in a vast majority pre-ASOIAF history, which under this sub's spoiler guide still states counts as a ""no spoilers"", I wonder if there will be any change at all.   I know this is a mod decision, but with the release immanent it is a curiosity I did have.  

The other issue I can see arising is people sharing artwork/family trees available in the book,  and as I would imagine that as all the artwork was commissioned specifically for TWOIAF that there could be copyright issues in posting some of that content here.  I am also curious as to how users should approach sharing that content here as well.

He and his brother were taken from their home in Germany and raised in Rome.  Arminius became a trusted warrior who led Roman troops and advised Roman leaders.  However, when he returned to Germany with the Romans as part of a mission to keep the Germans under control, he visited his family and his old home and decided to turn against Rome.  From there his story goes a little better than Theon's because he led an incredibly successful campaign against the Romans and eventually drove them out of Germany.  However, IIRC, he was also betrayed by his followers when he became too ambitious.

What other parallels have you seen?

Mathematically you'd think they would try to get at least two seasons out of book 4 but it's not that simple.

And Bran's story is already caught up to the books. Leaked production photos seem to show that Cersei's nude walk (book 5) is being shot for season 5, so they don't seem to be slowing the pace at all. 

Has anyone read what the plan is? It seems like season 5 will exhaust the books. I know that GRRM has told certain plot details to the showrunners but that's a far cry from giving them the whole story.

Then when the village is attacked the crows help them, which you'd think is the old gods, but the dark guy on the Elk who helps them leaves you with the same spooky feeling as The Stranger mentioned just a few pages ago. 

Will it be revealed later or are we left to speculate?

My question is, from birth are dragons raised by their humans or by their parent(s)? In the case of wild dragons I would assume they would be raised/cared for by their dragon parent. However say Dany's dragons reproduced. Would Dany be the caregiver for the newborn dragon as well, or would the dragon that laid the egg be the caregiver?

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ghost_grass

I initially thought it might be an allusion to snow/ice, but then it seems like the prophecy is talking about two variants of the same thing.  It isn't really applicable to snow/ice as snow is not a white variant of something else. edit: plus snow wouldn't necessarily kill everybody, people have lived through countless winters.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently midway through A Storm of Swords, and am 3 episodes into the second season. The amount of differences so far in the second season have been huge to me. While the first season seemed to follow the book very closely, this season seems so much different. Bronn is captain of the citywatch, Shae is Sansa's handmaid, Davos and Stannis Baratheon's story seems so much different. Did I really gloss over the fact that Stannis is getting it on with Melisandre in the book?I kind of had a feeling, but I don't remember anything that outright said it. Also plot points seem to be occurring faster or before they should compared to the book.

Anyways, the reason I bring it here is to just get anyone's opinion on this. Does it make watching the show difficult, because I've spent the first few episodes of this season comparing them to the book more than getting into it. I think I finally realize what people mean by ""the book is much better than the show/movie""",9,4,False,self,,,,,
