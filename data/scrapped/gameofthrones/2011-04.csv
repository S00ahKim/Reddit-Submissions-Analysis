One idea I quite like (I have no idea if it's possible or not) would be to change the entire top blue banner into the wall, complete with a little castle black with elevator or something.

Something much simpler like using the official GoT logo, or some heraldry would also work of course.

All suggestions welcome!

**Edit**

A few really great submissions have been posted, any banner you see up top is not final and is me playing around with things and having a look at them in the proper context. **Keep on posting ideas, this isn't over yet!**

kjhatch's idea of the alien atop the Iron Throne was both the most popular and best implemented suggestion, and the new banner and logo is courtesy of him. A very big thank you to you from all of us at this subreddit!",49,14,False,self,,,,,

I would say of all the awful and fucked up shit the other characters pull, I would say Cersei is just beyond the pale in terms cunt-itude, and her dad is a close second (he's just a real grade-A douchebag). Later on in the series Martin tries to make her more sympathetic by explaining how terrible of a husband Robert was, and how afraid she is for her children. But it's like even in those things all she can ever think about it is how she can capitalize on it, and manipulate people, and even worse, as you see later in the series, she's not even that good at it.

I actually find this to be absurdly low.  The same articles say each episode of Camelot (which I would rate just a notch above Pillars of the Earth in terms of quality) is costing $7 million.  The pilot episode of Boardwalk Empire alone cost [$18 million](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Boardwalk_Empire#Development) and the The Pacific series together cost a staggering [$217 million](http://www.popeater.com/2010/08/27/the-pacific-budget/) *plus* $10 million for promotion.

I find it difficult to believe that all ten hours of what looks to be a very good series with high production values was shot for what Hollywood would consider a ""low budget"" film.  I can't believe that (fairly) well known actors such as Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, and Lena Hedley would work for what must be scale.  Actually if these reports are true and HBO is getting such an incredible deal on this series I think that is a good thing as they are much more likely to greenlight additional seasons.

The limbs hacked apart and arranged in some sort of a circle - for what purpose? How was the blood mysteriously gone when they went back? What was that red blanket in the snow?

3) How the heck did Will get away? Why not have him climb a tree like the book? So the WW just left him alone? Why?

4) It would have been much more chilling had Will been just struck dumb by fear, mumbling to himself, raving, like in the book. 

5) What was up with that shirtless scene with Theon, Rob and Jon? Why was that in there? Seemed weird to me.

So far I've seen a lot of common complaints about changes that diverge from the book cannon.  I thought it could be fun to explore this with the Reddit community and fellow nerds.

I'll go first!

**Change:  TV Catelyn, as opposed as book Catelyn, begs Eddard to refuse the King's offer.**

I've rewatched the episode and I think I know why they did that.  To us book fans, we see the bigger story and kind of saw the episode for it's full symbolic/foreshadowy glory.

But HBO is making a show that needs to appeal to a larger crowd and so choices must be made to simplify the storyline at first to draw people in at a comfortable pace.

My guess is that choice was made to illustrate the strong loving relationship between Catelyn and Eddard.  Think about it.  Had Catelyn insisted on Eddard leaving with no second thought about their marriage, the casual, blank slate viewer might not understand that their relationship is one of the few marriage in the story to be actually loving.  This plays a huge role in how we perceive Eddard and we all know why the writers want us to get attached to the character.


Speaking of which....  DAE really felt uneasy at the end of the scene in that Stark bedroom, with Catelyn arguing why Eddard shouldn't go over one of his shoulder, and that other guy arguing why he should go over Eddard's other shoulder.  It was. so. cheesy.",31,22,False,self,,,,,

I can see some real dangers in how this show will play out though. Dany's entire story is a real minefield. The Rapey marriage consummation scene was a quite from the book, but I don't think the original scene works as a screen play. 

So much of this story connection to the reader is through the characters internal dialogue. We already see a lot of the issues translating media present's in the first episode. I'm not sure this excuse's how the show out when play's out when presented to the uninitiated viewer. I suspect the female characters are going to lose more in translation then their male counterparts this may be a real problem for the popular appeal of this show.

But something that's been bugging me since the show was first announced is how they're going to pull off some of the more fantastical aspects of the books within a television budget. This isn't too much of a problem for the first book, and I think we saw some of how they'll address this in the very beginning of the episode where an Other made a brief appearance. It was kept mostly in shadow and seen in brief glimpses, partly to keep them mysterious, but I imagine it was mostly done that way because why spend a bunch of money designing and creating a creature that [won't be a main part of the plot until a season or two from now](/spoiler)? And the battles shouldn't be too hard either, as they're mostly talked about rather than seen. Even the ones that are observed by POV characters could be done with a bunch of extras on some CGI set extensions like [the sea battle at King's Landing](/spoiler).

But, what I'm concerned about is the character work that seems like it would take a film budget to pull off convincingly. Likely in the next episode we'll see [a direwolf ripping out a man's throat](/spoiler) and by the end of the first season, [Daenerys is going to have three dragons crawling around her](/spoiler). I don't see how they are going to do that with the little puppies they've been using, and honestly thought they might cut out the wolves altogether. Sacrilegious, I know! But most of them [are out of the picture by the end of the first book](/spoiler) and leaving them in the story just means that next season [we'll have two characters fighting side-by-side with direwolves](/spoiler).

It'll only get more challenging from there, in terms of special effects, when you've got a character walking around missing an arm, [sorceresses summoning demons](/spoiler), and the menagerie of creatures on the other side of the Wall make themselves known. And of course, there's [Daenerys' aforementioned dragons](/spoiler) which will probably the bellwether of their intentions for future seasons. They've been doing a great job with the CGI set extensions, but close-up character work is much harder to pull off convincingly with low-budget effects.

I have been a huge fan of the series since I picked up the first book last year and my girlfriend has been around to witness me geeking out about it, so we came at it from two different perspectives; me with a lot of expectations and her eager to see what all he fuss is about.

Everything was clearly rushed and shoehorned into an hour's time. If I were to put my own stamp on the storytelling, I would have cut out the prelude scene and I would have taken more artistic liberties with streamlining the story around the events and characters that moved the story forward. For example, Jorah Mormont's introduction was unconvincing and simplified. ""Hello, I'm your knight."" ""Oh great, I guess I will trust you now."" No, that won't work on TV. We needed to see some serious fealty swearing going on.

Similarly, the way the episode ends is shocking, but not nearly as much as it should have been. Basically, we end the hour with 3 characters whom nobody really cares about yet, and then are forced to witness something that SHOULD be really impactful, but comes off as a mere cliffhanger. Cersei and Jaime, well, the audience knows they're naughty, but unless you were paying extra close attention to their earlier scene, (which you probably weren't if you are new) then you might be more confused than intrigued by the fact that they're fucking. Then there's Bran. Adorable, yes, but not nearly as strong a character as he needed to be in order for us to feel sympathy.

Tyrion and Arya, two of the more enjoyable characters in the book, were introduced to the TV audience as nuisances. I absolutely abhorred the tack of turning Arya into nothing more than a bratty child. Part of her appeal is that she has her own intelligence and imagination. Tyrion's introduction, it seemed, was just a ploy to get breasts on the screen. What a mistreatment!

The Dothraki wedding lacked the real brutality that I was expecting. I hate to be so nitpicky, but you could totally tell the men were ""fucking"" the women while fully clothed. That made it so cartoonish and PG-13 to me.

But look, I enjoyed the show none the less. Viserys and Dani's interactions were much better than I had hoped for. Sean Bean is great. And its only the beginning. It wasn't as good as some of the other premium channel stuff that's out there, but I won't write it off based on one episode. One critical review I've read called out the lack of episodic cohesion, which is very apparent so far. Most individual episodic shows have a common theme amongst each episode and this is where I actually wanted the writers to get creative.

From here, spoilers absolutely abound.  If youre not familiar with the books, please, dont read on.  It seems impractical to [/spoiler] every post.  

If you look at your copy of aGoT, weve had the events from the following chapters: Prologue, Bran I, Cat 1, Daenerys 1, Eddard I, Jon I, Cat II, Arya I, Bran II, Daenerys II.  The most notable change is the reshuffling to fit the episodic format.  In the book, Daenerys wedding happens *after* Bran falls.  We even see Tyrion 3 days later, commenting on him still being alive, before the wedding.  Obviously, that was reshuffled to give a cliff-hanger ending and bring a bit more Daenerys into the opening.  

(Interestingly, if youre reading on Kindle, Brans fall is exactly 10% of the way in.  I doubt the rest of the episodes will slice up so nicely, but I still think its pretty cool)


I think its likely that the next episode will encompass Tyrion I (Tyrion and various members of the Lannister family discussing the fall.  Establishes Joffrey and the Hound as utter shits, which I suspect will be important later in the episode as well as clarifying the importance of what Bran saw  Quite a few people dont seem to have caught the significance of the twincest), Jon II (Establishes the Jon/Catelyn relationship, the Jon/Arya relationship, Needle and the departure), Eddard I (Travelling South, details about how scummy the Kingslayer is), Tyrion II (Tyrion and Jon on the route north), Catelyn I (The assassination attempt), Sansa I, Eddard II (I suspect this will be the end of the episode), as well as a chunk of Daenerys III (This follows the trend of the first episode of reshuffling her scenes so as to keep her involved in the story).  


The major events from these chapters are: Needle, Jon leaving to join the Black Watch, the attempted assassination of Bran, the beginning of Joffrey/Aryas hatred and the loss of Nymeria and Lady.  

Im genuinely not sure what theyll be doing with Daenerys.  Shes not mentioned after the wedding till about half way through the book.  I assume theyll be splitting her scenes in order to spread her throughout the episodes.  Shes only got 10 PoVs throughout the book, and the vast majority happen in the second half.

Spoilers for episode 1.01 and all of book 1.**

I'm seeing a lot of comments about how that first tender night in the book is the basis for their whole relationship, and that the TV version completely ruins it by changing it to a rape. I believe that's reading too much into the book version and over-romanticizing it.

I submit that that night does not set off a storybook romance. They do not love each other, or even begin to, that night. At most, it adds some depth of character to Drogo (which can easily still be shown later on the show). It adds little to Dany's character other than her acceptance of her duty (which is sufficiently shown anyway by the entirety of her actions) and it speaks nothing to their actual feelings for one another.

Her wedding-night ""yes"" was not the spark of a relationship, it was the simple duty she had been working up the courage to go through with all day, facilitated by the physical readiness of foreplay she had no authority to refuse. Its omission does not really change the arc of their relationship.

Consider what follows in the book. After the wedding night, they embark on the long journey from Pentos to Vaes Dothrak. (Difficult to know the exact timeframe, but we can assume at least several weeks from the transitions in the prose.) Here's the beginning of that journey in the book (I hope it's acceptable fair use to quote this):

&gt; At first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.
&gt;
&gt; Even the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night...

A true night in shining armor, huh? Ignoring his princess by day, brutally forcing her every night, no matter her pain, no matter her tears, for days (maybe weeks) on end. Those of you objecting to the TV version, why are you accepting of the book version? Does one situationally-required ""yes"" at the beginning excuse all the rest? Frankly, that opinion seems even more offensive -- just caress your way to one verbal consent (in a situation she's not allowed to refuse anyway) and after that, an unlimited amount of painful forced sex is perfectly fine?

During the above, the book gives us no thoughts of love in Dany's mind. No wishful remembrance of that gentle warrior on the first night. Nothing. She is not in love. She is in pain and wants to kill herself.

The true first sparks happen AFTER all of the above, as Dany overcomes her pain and grows in strength, later along that journey to Vaes Dothrak. This strength comes from the dragon blood within her, not some fairy-tale unrequited love. Only when she is strong enough to cast off her brother and take what she wants from her husband, only when he starts to see her as a worthy mate and not a piece of property to be used for his enjoyment, that's when their love begins.

OK, we know that season 2 has been greenlit (10 episodes), and the producers are saying that book 3 will require two 10-episode seasons because it's so long. So, first question:

Where in book 3 do you think the split will be? One article I read suggested it would be in a particularly heartrending place...

Second question/musings: Given that book 2 is a lot longer than book 1, I personally don't think 10 episodes will really cut it. But conversely, I don't think book 3 will need 20 episodes, since it's only half again as long as book 1.

So what if they split book 2 into 12 episodes, and book 3 into 18 episodes? Season 2 would be the first 10 of book 2, season 3 would finish book 2 and have the first 8 episodes of book 3, and season 4 would finish book 3. Given that, the season breaks would split book 2 at 10/12ths (lets say just over 80% of the book) and book 3 a little before the halfway point. If they chose something like that, where in books 2 and 3 do you think the logical split points would be for maximum awesomeness and ""god I can't wait for the next season""-ness?",5,3,False,self,,,,,

""Martin's writing is less than stellar and more screenplay than actual literary fare. AGOT engrossed me until the last third of it when he bogged the reader down with unnecessary expositions. His editor just simply didn't do his/her diligence. 

Clash is another matter. I couldn't believe the nonsense about the rainbow colors of the guard and the bit about the character always being interested in colors and different fabrics. Oye. That's just weak. Even if the characters weren't gay it's telling and not showing. Telling in this manner is crass and just very, very poor (it's also the same reason I have not been reading a lot of new romance in recent years- I'm pretty absolute in not tolerating authors who take the easy way out; if they can't take the time to do it well then there's no reason for me to spend the time reading it). If the characters are lovers then let the relationship be addressed through their actions, etc, but to do the above in the prologue is in poor taste to say the very least and it's just bad craft. 

I do take exception to the prologue in each book because it's supposed to be things that happened outside of the time line of the story itself. This is a sequel. The time line is following events of the first book. Martin just needed a good editor to tell him that all these things can be put into the storyline somewhere if they're necessary. It would keep forward momentum and the writing would be tighter. The prologue in the first work wasn't even necessary when it came down to it as the issues were wonderfully dealt with through Jon Snow's POV. It was awesome and demonstrable of weaving the story together tightly and well. The prologue, subsequently, wound up being irrelevant and extraneous (although it was at least shorter than the behemoth prologue in Clash). Mind you, I could get past the prologue being there if it were shorter, more concise and just not so darned ham fisted.

I think Martin paid more attention to his words and craft in AGOT. Very, very bummed. And seriously, what weenie compares this guy to Tolkien? Same genre, I suppose, but the writing of Martin is far inferior to Tolkien's.""

Personally, I don't object to the prologue issue, as the definition of a prologue does not say it is supposed to take place ""outside the timeline.""  As far as her quips about the writing regarding Renly, I just disagree.  I really don't see why this is ""poor writing.""",17,1,False,self,,,,,

Call your Cable operator and ask them how much it is to add basic cable to your Internet. Make sure you stress BASIC. If it sounds high inquire if there are any lower packages. If it still sounds high inquire if there are any lower packages. After you agree on the price ask how much for HBO, you heard they had a promo on it right now.

My company gives a $15 discount on Internet for Cable subs (or Phone Subs) and offers Basic Cable for $9-$19. HBO is also free for 3 months when signing up. The only other cost is the Box ($3.25 STD, 8.20 HD) and the setup (Ask about Self-Install)

I could care less if you Pirate the show, just many of you have expressed an interest in paying for it.

Once you set this up you can use HBOGo or your cables providers portal (xfinity.com etc...) for viewing.

I am at the point where Bronn has just fought for Tyrion's freedom, and won (*gasp*).

Were I differ from many of you, is that I started reading the books after I saw the show, so if anyone's curious about how I would interpret the books after seeing (admittedly the first episode of) the show, ask away (BUT PLEASE DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING!!)

My Predictions:

* I will soon get to a point where Jon runs off the find Benjen

* Arya's gonna beat the shit outta Joffrey (more of a hope than a prediction)

* Lyssa poisoned/killed Jon Arryn (Here's why: we just found out that Jon Arryn wanted to send the son away to be fostered. It is clear that the woman has a... too strong relationship with her son. Rather than lose him, I feel like she may have just killed the husband)

* Jon Snow is somehow heir to the throne (Petyr (who I really like as a character, definitely an intriguing guy) mentioned something that made me think that that was what Jon Arryn was investigating before he died, something about the lineage of Jon Snow, or at least that's what I seemed to take away)

But more than all of that, I just wanted to say **THANK YOU!!!** This book is awesome! I'm powering through it, and absolutely love it! And again, if you have any questions about how the book looks through a person-who-watched-the-show-first's eyes, ask away

P.S. If anyone is asking whether they should bother reading the book, having already seen the first episode, the answer is a resounding YES

- The whole thing about where Robert Arryn was going to foster (Casterly Rock, no - Dragonstone - no Casterly Rock - Dragonstone, I tell you!): This is given big importance it seems. Not sure why yet. I mean, we already know all we needed to know about Jon Arryn, who cares about the kid, right? :D -&gt; I'm guessing I must be wrong ;)

- **Varys**.  I'm assuming the two guys Arya eavesdropped on were him and Illyrio. So he's doing everything he can to keep the peace (juggling, as he puts it) UNTIL the Dothraki / Targaryens were ready to cross the sea. But then he did as Robert asked and offered lordship to whoever killed Dany, wtf? (oh, maybe he KNEW that sending someone to kill Dany was going to fail, but would succeed in getting Khal Drogo to bestir himself? damn clever bald man)

He probably didn't even care about Ned, either - he just gave him that life-saving advice (denouncing the Baratheons as usurpers, telling Robb to lay down his sword) in order to hold off war just a bit longer :/

- Interesting point I caught on the second read: **Pycelle**. When Ned asks him, he says he's certain Jon died of illness. A while later, Robert demands Dany killed, and Varys suggests the tears of Lys. Pycelle then EYES HIM SUSPICIOUSLY! Why, old man? if it's true that you didn't know anything about no poison? Speaking of it, isn't purging something you do to people who have been poisoned? Sending Maester Colemon away...you are indeed a ""creature of the Queen"" -.-'

- **The Hound**, I think you'll turn out to be an awesome badass character :)

- Syrio Forel, thanks for that fight. I hadn't cheered for a book in years :)

- Tyrion. I loved his neutrality at the beginning, and how he helped Jon and Bran. I know I'm supposed to love him, he's one of the most favorite characters of people who've read all the books, but I think I'll find it hard to do until he makes his peace with the Starks.

Alright, that's what I can think of right now. Discuss if you want, but please don't spoil :) I had to get these things out of my head :)

Two. I can't stand Melisandre. All her red business, what with the phantom-shitting and religious fervor - it's getting a little old. I wish she becomes wolf food soon.

Three. The Reed girl tells Bran a semi-allegorical tale involving wolf girl, dragon knight, porcupine squires, and a Knight of the Laughing Tree. Who were the people involved? Is the Lyanna story? I didn't pay much attention the first time around.

Finally. These books are so good! I get so excited for my reading time, and dread the moment I finish the fourth book because I don't want to wait for the next one. Isn't as bad as waiting five years, I guess. But still!

This is a followup from my [old post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/gv8b0/just_wanted_to_say_thanks_book_spoilers/) in which I was about halfway through the book. Well, rather than going out and toasting the victory of my Bruins, I stayed in and read. And I am glad I did. I am so fucking engrossed in this series it's not even funny. I literally can't think of *any* series I've read that I've enjoyed this much. The most accurate parallelism I've heard so far is between this series and *The Wire*, in that they are both unflinchingly honest, with characters that seem way to real to be works of fiction.That being said, here come my initial thoughts after finishing the first book:

* FUCK. JOFFREY.

* I'm so nervous about to what's gonna happen to Jon Snow, and I really hope he can meet up with Robb at some point and kill, well... the Lannisters as a whole, I guess

* The fuck happened to Arya? Did she get scalped? When I read her last scene, I had assumed Yoren was going to cut off her hair, and then help he get out, hence the emphasis on *boy*

* Jon Snow (yes, if you haven't figured it out, he is my favorite character) definitely has some other shit going on. No one broods that much about being a bastard unless they're secretly not a bastard. Time will tell, but I think he's somehow connected to the Baratheons

* Again, FUCK. JOFFREY.

* Something sketchy is going on with Stannis, and I'm really not sure what it is. No word from him, for basically the entire book. Now his scumbag nephew (fuck Joffrey) [HE'S NOT REALLY A BARATHEON, GUYS! IT'S A LIE! A LIE!!](\spoiler) is on the throne, his brother is claiming to be king, and everyone else and swearing allegiance to whoever, which brings me to m next point:

* I'm confused about what they decided at the Riverrun. Was the general consensus that they wanted to go back to having seven individual kindoms, and hence Robb would be ""The King of The North""? What were the original Kingdoms (I had thought they were Eyrie, Riverrun, Winterfell, Casterly Rock, etc), and wouldn't half of that group be swearing fealty to Edmure?

* They're something fishy going on with Lysa and her son. I still think that she killed Jon Arryn, but I don't know why she's so... possessive? It's a little bizarre

* They didn't really say it one way or antoher, but please tell me that Jaime's dead...

* And finally, FUCK. JOFFREY.

That's about it. I'm so pumped to start the second book (which I will be doing in about 15 minutes, after making myself a chicken salad sandwich",19,2,False,self,,,,,

We seem to be doing pretty well so far, but there are still a few disagreements over exactly what should be tagged and what shouldn't. I would like to propose the following:
*****
*Submissions*  
If your submission contains any spoilers at all, make it clear in the title what might be spoiled; so a typical section of the frontpage might appear like this:

**Scumbag Jaime [1.01 spoiler]** (imgur.com)  

**Some questions about Renly [book 2 spoilers]** (self.gameofthrones)  

**HBO casting call for Season 2** (HBO.com)  

**Events near the Ruby Ford [1.02 spoilers]** (self.gameofthrones)  

**Interview with Kit Harington (Jon Snow) [minor book 2 spoilers]** (youtube.com)  

**Who makes Sansa's dresses?** (self.gameofthrones)  

**Events at Winterfell [1.01 spoilers]** (self.gameofthrones)  

**Daenerys' return? [book 4 spoilers + speculation]** (self.gameofthrones)  

If partway through a book I suggest that you make a self post labelled ""[partway through book X]"" and begin by stating how far through the story you are.
*****
*Comments*  
I would suggest that within threads and submission comments, no spoiler tags are needed for spoilers already mentioned in the title. So in a submission labelled [Book 2 spoilers], one could expect to see untagged spoilers for books 1 and 2, but any information/informed guesses about books 3 onward would be tagged.  
*****
Finally, as a contingency plan, I suggest that major events are *always* in spoiler tags regardless of where you are posting them. This might include things like [Bran's fall](/spoiler) [1.01], [Joffrey's ""mercy""](/spoiler) [end of book 1], [The Red Wedding](/spoiler) [book 3?], [Jaime &amp; Aerys](/spoiler) [book 3] and [Jon's parentage](/spoiler) [speculative].

Beyond that, just use common sense; Is posting information X in thread Y likely to spoil the story for anyone? If so, use tags.

Not bad, but if I hadn't of read the books I could see myself not getting into it. 

Open to the Dothraki walking in a single line in an obvious attempt to make them look like a horde. I know, I know, what else are they going to do, and overall the atmosphere and the sets are great, but I just saw that and was like, yup, that's a line of people meant to suggest thousands. 

I'm mildly disatisfyed with the treatment they've given the Dany-Drogo love story. She didn't get raped, it's really, really hard to root for a rapist. I get that they're trying to make it out to be that she conquers Drogo with sex, but to me, from the books at least, Drogo was a great man in his own right. Now he's just a barbarian that will bend to the will of anyone that sexes him up good enough. Dany was lucky to have been wed to him. 

Jon's storyline is pretty simple here. His exchange with pretty much everyone was really good. The only one that seemed a little weak was with Robb. Why do TV and movies feel the need to have all man hugs go like, start towards each other a little, both stop, then be overcome by passion and take each other in a many man hug. That's a bit nitpicky. Now, the Catelyn exchange wasn't bad for the TV show, but it was bad for the story IMO. I had already read it wasn't coming, but I still wanted ""it should have been you,"" so bad. And what was worse was how well the scene leant itself to it. It's a parting, he's showing love to someone she loves, he's clearly a good guy, and what we get is, ""I want you to leave."" That's changed intentionally to make us not hate Catelyn, but it detracts from her character to tone down her hatred of Jon. The actress that plays her grew on me after one episode, but that's dissipated with this one. Partially because she looks so old. She just seems whiny. 

As far as not hating characters goes, that entire Cersei first child speech better be shown to be a lie or I'm going to be royally pissed. 

The Arya telling Nymeria to go scene was hurt, for me, by the feeling that I had seen it about nine other times in various movies, shows, books, whatever. It probably would have worked better to have thrown more rocks. I was taken out of the story because it seemed....lazy. Go wolf. Wolf looks confused despite it being an animal and not understanding English. Wolf gets one rock thrown, more push thrown I might add, at it and just runs off stage because a trainer called it away. In the book the scene was better because she's has to really drive the wolf away instead of it just being like, awww, alright, later ho. 

Summer ripping the throat out was about as well done as it could be, but still a bit hard to believe. The dogs are too small if nothing else. 

There were only a few things that felt were great about this episode. Mark Addy and Sean Bean interactions. I'm starting to see that Sean Bean is a very, very good actor, and so is Mark Addy. Together they work perfectly. It was true in the crypts as well. They're the most enjoyable to watch on screen together for me. 

Arya's actress is great. I suspect it's a case of her just having to play herself, not unlike Charlie Sheen. I can't tell if the actress playing Sansa is really good and helping her portray her character how she's supposed to be portrayed, or kind of bad, but it still works out because the end result is the character being portrayed as she's supposed to be portrayed. 

The scene at the end where Ned pushes through people to see Arya and talk to the Robert, up through killing Lady is gold. The tension in that scene is spot works really, really well. Little annoyed that Ned didn't use ice, but if you think about it, it's kind of hard to do that with a dog. It probably worked better on screen how it went down. ",0,1,False,default,,,,,

The twists and turns.The near-constant action from chapter to chapter. The complete disregard for the traditional ""hero preservation"" model of pretty much all popular fiction. I'm a ""thorough"" reader when it comes to this stuff, and I like to stop and think and stew about things, so it took me almost two weeks to read the first book. 

Second book took longer, and it was a bit slower in the pacing. I was used to important people being killed off unceremoniously by then. Still an excellent book with lots of great plot movement and excitement about where things are going.

Book 3 took me quite a while to read, and I thought it was better than book 2 in almost every way. The Red Wedding scene managed to shock me even after everything that's happened. That is an impressive feat.

Through all three books, the story progressed, and the POV characters were interesting and important. It was all just undeniably, unapologetically GOOD.

And last week I started Book 4. I said it in the title, and I'll say it again...WTF?

What happened? Who are these POV characters? Why are they so boring and pointless? So far I've had a couple Sansa POVs, a couple SAM POVs, and a couple Cersei and Jamie POVs. Those were all fine, if a bit slow. Nothing seems to be happening anymore. It's like a train was barreling down the tracks, and I looked away for a second, now the train has alzheimers and can't remember where it was going, or why. And it's sitting there on the tracks, looking around at the trees and stuff laying around in the middle of nowhere, confused.
I can't understand what happened. 

This feels waaaay too much like what happened to the Wheel of Time series after half a dozen books...only with that one it took about 3 books to devolve into a boring confusing political mess. This was like...flipping a switch.

WoT has even recovered since the bad times (books 11-13 are great, IMHO).

Where is Tyrion? Where is Bran? Where is Dany? Where is the Onion Knight?

Why all this focus on Pike's succession story? Who cares? The only interesting person from that whole ""world"" is the daughter. It's all just so boring.

WTF happened to the story? Does it get better as the book progresses? I seriously want to just stop reading right now. I can't tell you how sad that makes me, either. HBO would have condensed the 200+ pages of Book 4 that I've read so far into maybe 1 episode of TV, being generous.

At this point, for a moment, you have to stop watching the show as someone who has read the books and pretend you don't know anything else about Cersei Lannister.

First they are making it so Cersei is in some way identifiable: she has feelings, can be hurt, etc.

Second (which has yet to come) in an offhand comment or anecdote they reveal the truth about about her son's death (which in the books was merely pregnancies, however abortions wouldn't arouse as much sympathy as a sick and slowly dying child), which we will see is similar to the mysterious fever that afflicted Arryn.

Upon revelation that Cersei has deliberately poisoned all of her husband's offspring to produce a pure Lannister heir, the audience is left with a feeling of betrayal and genuinely perceives Cersei is evil incarnate.

Whereas it takes several books to fill a year (in Westeros), this is obviously not possible with the TV show. With one book/series being produced per year, certain characters will age very fast quite obviously  in a way that is disparaging to the timeline of the book.

I feel like they can get away with it for Sansa they might even be able to keep boy actors (Joffrey/Bran) looking quite young for another few years. 

But Rickon, and especially Arya will go through considerable growth spurts (not to mention puberty). When I think forward to, say, season 6... the Arya in the book will be 13/14 whereas the actress will be quite obviously 18/19. 

This makes me wonder if the showrunners might consider portraying the actions of the book as farther apart, ie: what runs over 3 months in the book runs over a year in the show. That way everyone grows older naturally...

I have a feeling that Jon is going to be the savior of Westeros because he is set up to be the most courageous and is one of the most like-able characters.

I think that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark, and - for the real twist - Rhaegar Targaryen. Rhaegar is the complete package, handsome, valiant, genius and by all accounts a nice and fair person. There is no way that he would steal a women, he simply wouldn't need to. He fell in love with Lyanna which is why he named her the Lady of the Roses after winning a tournament and she fell in love with him then too. She was set to marry Robert but didn't want to so the only way they could be together was for them to hide away.

When Eddard and his crew showed up and fought and killed the three Kingsguards he found Jon inside and Lyanna dead (possibly from complications in childbirth?), which is the only reason I could see Rhaegar leaving her side to fight Robert.

I've thought about this quite a bit in the last year or two since I've read the books (all four of them and the graphic novels) and the more I think back the more it makes sense. Jon will awaken the fire sword because he has Dragon's blood in him, he might even get to be one of the people who rides one of Daenerys's dragons. Also I remember the book that Jon Eryn had that said the last time a Stark and Targaryen had a child it looked exactly like a stark, which is why Jon doesn't have any of the looks from Rhaegar.

I'm curious to see how you all think this might get adapted (or cut) from the series. There are various reasons why we will not likely see any flashbacks from the overthrow in season 1. However, I see several possible courses HBO might take.



WEBISODES

Why - It would be a GREAT way to feed us snacks in between seasons, and help to provide a greater understanding of how the overthrow of House Targ went down.

Why Not - I don't think that HBO has done this for any other series. Although I know THE WIRE did have some DVD extras that were flashbacks to before the series.



SEASON 2

WHY - Because HBO has already shot of all of S1, we would know if they had cast a Prince Rhaegar or Lyanna (for flashback purposes). By the time S2 rolls around we will know who is cast for future characters.

WHY NOT - S2 will cover presumably all or most of ACoK. The difficulty behind this would be trying to introduce the MANY new characters, while also explaining key events from 15 years ago.



A SINGLE SIDE-EPISODE

WHY - An effective way to tell viewers about the past is to take a single episode, and have it cover what happened 15 years ago. This could be told through the lens of either a bard, a maester, or perhaps even Howland Reed (albeit, that is just pure speculation on my part).

WHY NOT - Though it would be GREAT to see an episode with cameos for Lyanna, Rhaegar, and a revisit of Ned (after he dies in S1), HBO would have some difficulty deciding when to air it, and even MORE difficulty finding a way to present canon in a way that is different from the literature WITHOUT pissing off fans.


PERHAPS THEY WON'T?

WHY - In a series that is ALWAYS moving forward, it would be confusing to new-viewers to drop that much information and THEN go back to the present story-arc. Also, perhaps it creates a more alluring sense of grandeur regarding the deeds of Rhaegar by the storytelling alone. Much like the Greek tragedies, by learning about something without seeing it, the audience must instead fill in the blanks themselves.

WHY NOT - While I might speak for myself, I think most fans would at some point LOVE to see a skillfully done on-screen of what happened at Summerhall, The Trident, etc.

This is because the spoiler tag itself is flawed.

The spoiler tag relies on the css of the subreddit to mask itself. This means that when browsing /r/got from a mobile, or *even worse* reading a reply in your inbox, these spoiler tags will show up **as plain text**. So, just leaving a comment somewhere in /r/got puts you at risk of being severely spoiled - through nobody's fault!

Back when the show Lost was on, I modded the /r/lost subreddit and we used a different spoiler tag technique. One that actually successfully keeps the spoiler hidden even when browsing from a mobile or from your inbox. You can see that in action [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/be7kz/rlost_spoiler_rules/).

The spoiler tag does the same thing in that it makes use of reddit's hyperlink-masking, but the spoiler itself is hidden in mouseover text, instead of just the link-name. So, making a spoiler on this subreddit, where the proper CSS hasn't been implemented to make it mask itself, would still hide the text as intended. Observe;

    [spoiler](/s ""the spoiler text goes here"")

The spoiler-text goes inside the quotation marks instead of just inside the parenthesis, this forces reddit to hide the text naturally, resulting in;

[spoiler](/s ""see?? you'd have to mouseover this word to see the spoiler."")

That, combined with this nifty CSS added to the stylesheet will make the above word 'spoiler' turn into a block of whatever colour you like (in my example's case, reddit's light blue)

    a[href=""/s""] {
        font-size: 0;
        cursor: default;
        visibility: hidden
        }
    a[href=""/s""]::after {
        content: attr(title);
        background: #CEE3F8;
        color: #CEE3F8;
        font-size: small;
        padding: 0 0.5em 0 0.5em;

        }
    a[href=""/s""]:hover::after, a[href=""/s""]:active::after {

Some not so much. What do you guys thing? Favorites? Hates?

Here's my thoughts so far

Loves:

Arya - Best character in the show so far, she's been translated from the book even better than I expected and has the tomboyish rebel down pretty damn well

Tyrion - Great pick with Peter Dinklage.  He pulls off the smarmy outcast perfectly, although not exactly what I pictured in the book

Jon Snow - I feel he's done justice to the books and plays the lovable half-brother very well.

Joffrey - I want to kill the kid. He's a petulant little fuck and he does it perfectly.

Jaime - Grew on me the last episode, exudes the confidence Jaime threw around in the book and the actor pulls off his brash arrogance really well.

Likes:

Sansa - A little dry but it was actually kind of cool in episode 2 where you can almost hear her thoughts as she's processing how to live her little princess dream world.  Especially as she's betraying Arya.

Ned - Sean Bean definitely is the best pick to me.  He does the cold stoicism perfectly although I hope he's not a one-trick pony and that's all we'll get out of him

Baratheon - Great character but not really how I pictured him in the books.  I'm just not convinced of his friendship with Ned, it seems a little bland.

Dislikes:

Kat - In the books I always felt she was a cold but strong motherly type with a strong sense of duty to Ned.  In the show she just comes off as whiny and hobbled and it's totally throwing my perception of her off.  Not sure if it's the actress or just an inaccurate portrayal but so far not a fan.

Robb Stark - UGH NO. Not even sure how to explain it.  Bad.

Maester Luwin - AWFUL! Seems to pop in randomly to ramble off some horrible attempt at exposition and never offer anything directly to the Starks, but rather seems to almost be talking directly to us as the viewers.  Luwin was great in the books, horrible on TV.

(Not really spoilers for the series here strictly speaking, just dealing with the history of the rebellion, so if you don't want to know what happened then stop here.)

We know that Eddard S. and Robert B. were both warded as boys in the Eyrie to Jon Arryn. Ned being there makes perfect sense, he's the middle son of another great lord who would logically be traded as a ward for the purposes of making alliances. At this stage his father still lives in Winterfell and his older brother (Brandon) is the heir to the north.

But I can't reason out why Robert should be there at all. He already IS the lord of Storm's End. His lord father and lady mother were killed in a shipwreck (seen by Cressen in ACOK) and as the eldest of the 3 Baratheon boys he would have become the lord. Robert himself was there as the ship broke up within sight of the Keep's walls.

So why was he let leave the Stormlands at all? It doesn't make sense to send away a young lord when the line of the house would be in jeopardy since all the B. boys are too young to procreate (legitimately) yet. He'd also need to learn the art of rule and command, along with learning how to control his bannermen, which would be a lot more difficult to do away from the place he'd rule for the rest of life (as far as they'd know then). It'd make a lot more sense for Renly or Stannis to be sent off, but they WERE in Storm's End (or very close to it), since they had to survive the siege by Mace Tyrell during the rebellion.

Have I missed something glaringly obvious about this? The Starks make a big deal about keeping a member of the house in Winterfell at all times when possible, just in case, so it stands to reason that the other houses would try when possible to play on the safe side during the bottlenecks in the family tree.",20,3,False,default,,,,,

Our spoiler poilcy has three simple rules - 

* **Do not post spoilers in the title**

* **Report any spoilers you come across, downvoting isn't enough**

* **Use correct spoiler tags at all times - if you're not certain you need them, err on the side of caution**

We now have two spoiler tags - one for TV spoilers and one for book spoilers. The old spoiler tag system will remain in place to cover up spoilers already posted, but using the new tags is the way to go from now on.

With all the buzz lately, I want to finally get into this series.  So I was looking on Amazon for the books and came across the 4-book box set (which was recently packaged in response to the HBO series).  Here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/George-Martins-Thrones-4-Book-Boxed/dp/0345529057/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304049674&amp;sr=8-1

But from what I hear, the build quality of the books might not be as good, so I was hoping that maybe some member of this subreddit might have it and share their opinion on it before I hit the button on it.  Or alternatively, suggest other versions that may be better.  Thanks!",11,5,False,self,,,,,
