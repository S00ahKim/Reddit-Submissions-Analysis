(Major spoilers all around),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/idu49/differences_between_book_and_show_that_irked_you/,agentdom,1309486905,"I finished the book last week and I'm about five episodes into the show. The show is good by its own right, but there is some stuff that I just don't like.

* I don't like how they make Cersei a sympathetic character. On the flip side, they make Robert much more of a dick. Robert was just such a lovable oaf in the books, and Cersei was just another untrustworthy Lannister.

* Tyrion is portrayed as more of a Lannister than in the books where he's the outcast. He does take a whore later in the book as a companion, but he struggles that she only loves his money. In the show, he's fine with the easy whore love.

* Episode 4 had a lot of moments that were ""eh"" for me. Sam and Jon's talk about virginity was a tad bit odd. The fact that Littlefinger is the one to tell Sansa about the Hound got his burn from his brother didn't fit for me either. When the Hound starts being kind to her later, I feel like it hinges so much on that scene.

I also don't love the aging of the kids, but I can understand why they did it.

Anyway, those are my thoughts. I'm still loving both, I'm just curious how others feel about the difference.

I see so many surprised people who have just finished the Red Wedding and are completely stunned, but I remember that this wasn't my experience reading the book...

I was, admittedly, shocked when Ned Stark died in Game of Thrones.  I didn't see that coming, and that event basically reframed this whole fantasy world of Westeros for me.  

Which is why I pretty much saw Robb Stark's death coming. He is the sole remaining character living by 'What would Ned Stark do?'  I mean the whole set up and lead in to the Red Wedding, I just kept saying 'It's a trap, don't go there, they gonna kill you son,' during all the chapters building up to that point.  As such, when it finally happened, I wasn't nearly as traumatized as other readers.

On the other hand, this what my reaction to the Jaime Lannister events:

""Wha?  What?!  No, Vargo Hoat, no!  you can't take the Kingslayer's right hand!  He's the best swordsman in the realm!  You can't disarm him!  NOOOOOOO!!  George RR Martin, you cruel fat fucking man!""",47,6,False,self,,,,,

I would not advise it to anyone who has not read ASoS yet. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
**

So, I just finished the chapter of Edmure's ""wedding"" and therefore learned about Catelyn's, Robb's and other's death. Even though I am not yet sure that they are dead (this is one thing Bran's and Beric Dondarrion's ""deaths"" taught me), my heart is obviously broken, my mind blown and I want nothing more than to see the Freys die in blood and agony. But it also lead me to a somewhat interesting reflexion about the curse of the Starks and the theme of justice in ASOIAF.

* First, about the direwolves. At this point it seems obvious to me that a Stark who loses his direwolf is a doomed Stark. For instance, Eddard was without a direwolf when he died. Same thing for Robb. And Sansa's life is a hell about since Lady's death. On the other hand, Rickon is as safe as a Stark can be and he stays with his Shaggydog. As for Bran, he is a warg, and he seems safe too. This makes Sansa and Jon's chapters all the more interesting. It also makes me wonder if there is something in the history of the Starks that would support this theory. Besides, is it even possible for a direwolf to live as long as its master, which would make them somewhat like the Targaryen's dragons?

* My second point regards the themes of justice and vengeance in ASOIAF. On the one hand, we have people like Walder Frey but also Arya and the Lannisters (""A Lannister always pays his debts"") who think in terms of revenge. On the other hand, Beric Dondarrion and Stannis Baratheon think in terms of justice: they are fair, and both are supported by the Lord of Light. Am I onto something there or is it just pure coincidence (if there is such a thing as coincidence in ASOIAF)? Is the Lord of Light the god of justice? What would it make of the old and new gods or of the Drowned God?

Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this while I take a break from the books and the bloody horror. 

**Please, mark the spoilers beyond Edmure's wedding (p.706 of the latest paperback edition).**

A few months ago I ran a minecraft server but I was unhappy with the stability of the server-side mods.  I'm interested in playing again, but would anyone from this reddit be willing to help me put in the time to create a recreated game of thrones universe? 

[I'd want to create it off of a map like this](http://winterfellkeep.com/images/westeros-essos-map%20lq.jpg)

There would be some initial terrain design to get our world to match the shape of westeros, and probably ""boundaries"" beyond that where the minecraft terrain would generate freely.

Once the shape of Westeros was complete I would probably put place-holders at all of the named areas of the map and users could build at those sites, but the larger sites would be kept true to the story-line and based off of images from the book and the series.

Let me know if there is interest in this,  thanks!

So how is it that Jaime is able to flee the city after attacking Ned, and then go on to lead Lannister forces in battle? How come no one mentions that he is abandoning the job that he is sworn to do? (When he broke his oath to protect the King the first time, he earned the scorn of the entire Kingdom. Granted, running away isn't nearly as bad as killing the king, but breaking an oath is a big deal in this world.)

First up: [Crusty, fresh-baked Bread](http://innatthecrossroads.com/2011/05/18/crusty-fresh-baked-bread/)

I followed the recipe exactly.  This [bread](http://i.imgur.com/UomnE.jpg) is amazing! The outside is nice and crusty, and the [inside](http://i.imgur.com/unehs.jpg) is soft and chewy. My husband and I polished off a loaf in under 30 minutes by dipping it in a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and feta cheese.  Sooooo yummy.

The only thing I would do differently with the bread next time is let the dough sit in the fridge a day or two as my husband and I are both partial to sourdough.  Otherwise, it is perfect.

Next up: [Thick stew of Mussels, Crabs and 3 kinds of Fish](http://innatthecrossroads.com/2011/06/08/thick-stew-of-mussels-crabs-and-3-kinds-of-fish/#more-2154).

The first difference was the timeline.  At the start of the book it has been 15 years since Robert's rebellion.  In the show however, it has been 17 years, and therefore everyone is two or 3 years older in the show (Bran is 10 not 7, Jon and Rob are 17 not 15, Rickon is 6 not 3).  I'm just wondering if this difference was put in place by the shows producers to make the story more believable and the characters better (having a 15 year old playing Rob or Jon and being such badasses would seem weird to the american public at large), or was this difference put in by GRRM because he later came to believe that the characters should be older than when he started out (i get this idea from the fact that he originally was going to write ADWD starting 5 years after ASOS, but decided he didn't want to write with so many flashbacks and decided to write AFFC and ADWD to fill in that five year gap and expand the series to 7 books)?

The next difference isn't as major, but I don't really see any reason why the difference exists.  The difference I am referring to is in the Books the Others are called ""Others"" but in the show they are referred to only as the ""White Walkers.""  I can't figure out why they did this as it removes a common curse phrase from the books - ie the others take your honor and shove it up your ass - and also makes it hard to explain to people watching the show what a wight is, since they seem to think you are just forgetting to say walker.",15,3,False,self,,,,,

There is a lot of imagery the TV series left out for sure (The Eyrie, Dothraki 'capital', the tournament, sail to King's Landing, battle scenes)... but very little plot. 

There is a lot more reference to characters that are yet to appear (Stannis, Rayner, lords of Riverrun, probably a bunch more that have been mentioned but yet to prove significant) and the chapter on Bran's dream along with the heavier emphasis on crows felt like new foreshadowing... 

... but otherwise the series has kept to the book so strictly that I feel a bit like I am re-watching the series in extremely slow motion.

I believe the problem is when the description in the spoiler tag is changed to specify the book the spoiler refers to. It's not a huge deal right now, but if more people start specifying the book number in the spoiler, it could make this subreddit very Alien Blue unfriendly.

Here's what I'm expecting to find.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/iizks/i_never_read_the_books_and_im_about_to_watch/,Idonttrustpandas,1310043411,"I have a few ideas on what Games of Thrones will be like, mainly based on what I read and saw on Reddit.
Sean Bean is the king of Gameofthrone-land, and he has a lot of enemies, noble families who want his throne (thus the name). So intrigues and manipulations and conspiracies and murders and power games all around.
Peter Dinklage is a nice guy in a family of bad guys, and he uses humor and diplomacy to gain power, instead of, you know, cutting people's throat open. He also bitch slaps Draco Malfoy (blond annoying kid). Which seems to be a high point of the show, according the popularity of gifs and videos endlessly replaying the scene.
I heard ""winter is coming"" a lot so I suppose things must be settled down before winter, because snow/cold stop people from traveling and fighting ? And there is something about a John Snow. So this guy is either a personification of winter, or a badass adventurer traveling around and... giving cool advices to other protagonists ? About the futility of power and money ? Maybe ?
Mainly, I assume that it will be a lot of intrigues, like a Middle-Age and fantasy version of the Tudors. Since I'm not really into that I'm not sure I will like it. But people seem to be really enthusiastic about the show so I'm ready to be pleasantly surprised. I hope there will be a little bit of politics and a lot of fighting in the snow with 6 feet long swords. 
I guess I'll edit the post after watching the first episode, to see if I got it right, or if I was totally mislead.

Edit : Sooooooo, I finished the first episode. And it's one of the best pilote that I have seen in a while ! I didn't think they would be so many places and so many characters, and that every one would be so complex and intriguing. So far, I can tell who are the bad guys and the good guys, but I can hate or love them at 100%, which I guess is a very good sign for the rest of the show. And the blonde ones from oversea who complain about behing exiled ? No idea if they are right or wrong...

But I haven't really been a fan of much high fantasy in a long time.  I was actually thinking I might not be that interested in the show after the first scene involving the White Walkers.  It was well done, to be sure, but I was skeptical about how much monsters and the like were going to be a part of the show.  
   
  
Needless to say, there was barely a hint of anything too fantastical for several episodes, and even what little was there was pretty easy to swallow.  Even the wights weren't too bad, but maybe I am just desensitized to zombies these days.  So I was most of the way through the show, and I was pretty satisfied it would be staying grounded in realism with only hints of the supernatural.  The dragons did make me question that assumption a bit, but I guess I didn't mind too much because dragons are still physical beings.  They are powerful, for sure, but their power is pretty well-defined: can fly, can breath fire, hard to kill.

Enter book 2.  I am still enjoying the story (Tyrion's sections are just awesome and should make for great TV), but some of the more ""crazy"" magic elements have left me with an ever so slightly sour taste in my mouth.  

The problem I have with things getting too magical is that it becomes hard to define where the powers begin and end.  If anybody ever watched that show Heroes, it started off well enough, but eventually I spent half the episodes saying to myself ""If this character has power X, why doesn't he just use it to do Y?""  And the answers never came, or when they did, they were unsatisfying and seemed a product of lazy writing.  

An example from ACoK is after Melisandre already had her impossible-to-stop shadow baby kill Renly.  When they need it to kill Ser Courtnay inside Storm's End, and Davos asks why she needs to be brought under the castle, there is some lame response that the castle stones are old and have protective spells in them.

I have the same such questions with Jaqen.  If he has the face changing power, how did he ever get caught?  And couldn't he have thought of a more clever method to escape?

Now don't get me wrong.  I still love the books and have many tired mornings from staying up too late reading.  I am just slightly disappointed that the fantasy aspects seem to be getting stronger as we go on.  I am hoping they have sort of plateaued and we won't be getting into anything much more insane/powerful.

But even given that, I worry about how the general viewing audience will react to some of this come season 2.  My parents (dad especially) really loved the show.  But, these are people who fell asleep half-way through the first LotR movie.  They generally get bored and just gloss over stuff when it contains too much fantasy.  I just hope that the series doesn't start alienating too many of the casual viewers with some of the more outlandish moments.

But I would really love to hear different takes on this.",14,1,False,self,,,,,

(no spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/inrkk/grrm_wont_able_to_finish_writing_in_time_for_the/,metacontent,1310503393,"There are a total of 7 books planned by GRRM, which potentially means we will get a 7 year HBO series.

But unfortunately only the first 5 books have been written, and the first year of the HBO series has already finished. 

Basically this means GRRM has 4 years to finish book 6, and then 1 more year to finish book 7. 

*But* GRRM has said he will *not* start writing the 6th book until sometime next year, so really he only has about 3 years to finish book 6 and 1 more to finish 7. 

It is highly doubtful that GRRM will finish 2 books in 4 years, given his track record. 

(Also don't forget that once a book is finished it then needs to be re-written as a screenplay and that HBO needs to have that screenplay well in advance of any filming, so in truth saying that GRRM has 4 years to finish the last 2 books is being extremely generous.)

**So what will HBO do when they run out of books?**

Personally, I joined the club about 2002-2003, a bit before AFFC was released. Before the series, I had read through as much Sword of Truth and Wheel of Time as was available, and while I was impressed with those at the time, I feel that GRRM truly spoiled us with the quality of his writing. Pretty much everyone back then agreed that the series was amazing, while the following remained relatively small.


Fast forward 8 years later and now there is a great show, and the 5th book is making the front page of main stream media publications. As much as we knew the books were amazing, did you ever foresee the popularity growing as it has, especially considering the adult content of the books?

I'm not saying she's likable or worthy of admiration by any means, but her chapters are just as interesting for me as the others.  I notice however that here on Reddit, Sansa gets hated on regularly...and I was suspicious that it's for the following reason:

I'm guessing Redditors are mostly (younger) guys, and I think they don't know how to allow themselves to step into a young female's perspective without feeling it's ""gay"" or ""stupid"" or ""boring"".  There are understandably some barriers in that guys maybe can't directly relate to things like pre-teen girl crushes (like Sansa had for Joffrey), but with a little imagination--and this is *fantasy* after all--I know it's possible for them to do so.  But the impression you get from Reddit is that because Sansa is something of an airhead she's a bad character and not worthy of our time.  

Yet here's how I look at it: it's not Sansa's *fault*.  The way she is is how many attractive noble daughters would be in medieval worlds, where being pretty was the main virtue (the other ""virtue"" being fertility) and being smart wasn't really encouraged.  Think of the opposite, Arya: she tries be more active, learn to fight and such, and she's instantly branded as being a ""boy"".  So, given the world and its culture, it's not necessarily Sansa's fault that she's the way she is.  Nearly all pretty girls of her position would probably be like her, and they would be viewed within that society as proper young ladies.  In other words, Sansa was being the kind of person she thinks she's supposed to be in that world.  **And I think this perspective is a very important one and it's a credit to GRRM for writing from this under-represented perspective.**

Let's face it, most fantasy books (until recently) do tend to show only two types of women: the very feminine ""hot chick"" the hero wants to hook up with, or the masculine ""warrior chick"" that is bad-ass...but often essentially a guy in a female body.

That's my hypothesis if you will...but it could just be she's flat-out uninteresting to both genders.  So I want to know if you female readers/viewers also dislike Sansa?  Maybe for different reasons?  Maybe for the same reasons?  

Also, guys, maybe I'm mischaracterizing your responses...feel free to correct me or enlighten me on what I might be missing.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses everyone!  It's getting kind of big for me to reply to all but I'm reading all of them and learning a lot!",119,28,False,self,,,,,

Not sure what I expected (maybe some thoughtful debate) from a subreddit for devoted fans, but getting downvoted for having a different perspective. Nice.

**EDIT 2**

Well, this 'discussion' has definitely gone off the rails, and it's my fault. I've been accused of being an ignoramus, an asshole, and told that i'm a pussy and 'whipped' and should really just fuck off. Most of the accusations that have been made are completely baseless and misunderstood, but I'm not going to give all the malice fuel. 

The fact that this thread has become so heated and controversial though, tells me that I may have something (albeit my position being initially vague and made without evidence) and there has been some nuggets of valuable insight amidst the flaming and derision. That is a good thing at least, and all the bile and venom people have contributed to the discussion says more about our society than the show.

i am in the process of relocating, so i do not have my desktop/server to run, but something like this would take a decent amount of planning before setting forth, the main concerns i have are:

ability to create the landmass that is westeros, while this is not a huge issue using an editor, something like forcing weather to be localized to certain areas might be an issue as well as..

scale, the wall alone is around 500 km in length, which would mean 500,000 bricks x 200 x thickness to complete it, not to mention it is around 2500 km from winterfell to kings landing, while these distances are easily within minecraft limits, performance issues will likely arise from having people so far apart

of concern as well would be the height of 200 m for the wall, last i checked, the limit is 128 blocks from bottom to top, while we could easily circumvent this issue a la the enterprise (by running in alpha) i would like the ability to use pistons and such for gates as well as obviously having monster spawns, so doing it at 50% scale might work

anyways, this is really just to see if there is interest in it, if we do, i'm sure we can draw up a plan to make it happen

Dany is still in Mereen, Jon is still trying to figure out what to do, Stannis is still in the north....nothing has happened. The character list at the end is over 50 pages long. Goddamitall, a plot should move forward, but instead it just branches out more and more and more perpendicular to any linear motion. What's next, a book detailing a single day from everyone in this stupid world's perspective? And fuck anyone who thinks martin is anywhere near Tolkein, that is so laughable. The first one was thrilling and intriguing and they have gone downhill since....At least that man will be long dead of gout or diabetes before this thing ever wraps up...I seriously doubt he has any idea where any of this is going, no outline in his head, no clue what will happen next, just see where his whim takes him. I am done with it, I no longer care about any of his characters or what happens to them. Sorry, but I'm going to re-read  some Tolkein and remember what good writing is. I wish Martin would do the same. I'm out. (If you like it, cool, this is just like, my opinion, man)

I started off with the book drop, nothing special, until I saw that some guy had dropped off a copy of ADWD. I inspected it and noticed that it didn't contain our library bar code or that of any library really, meaning it was a donation, meaning it would put in the back room closet never to see the light of day (we're sort of lazy bastards towards that), meaning  Baelor would unleash his wrath upon me if I didn't ""rescue"" it.

However in the two latest books, it seems like Feast and Dance should have been *one* book, with the filler chapters removed.  

I had read somewhere that these books weren't originally supposed to exist, that the story was supposed to pick up years after Storm of Swords, but Martin felt too much was being told in flashback, so he wanted to write Feast as a bridge book... but then it grew too long.

But I think Feast and Dance could have been combined easily-- just lose most of Brienne from Feast, and lose the Jon, Dany and Tyrion chapters from Dance where *nothing happens at all.*

I remember reading some initial criticism in the early reviews of the HBO series that made the point that ""non white"" characters were limited to the Dothraki and they were essentially ""savages"". Though, I can't imagine anything more savage than Viserys's treatment of his sister. That criticism has gone away with the perception of Khal Drogo changing and the ""European"" continent demonstrating just how deplorable it could be. But, I digress. Though, the criticism for the first season is un-warranted there is a great potential to diversify the cast depending upon the interpretation of the physical characteristics provided in the book.

Though, the character is only a minor character in the books I've read so far and as we know with Martin that means nothing. Fans of The Wire, imagine Idris Elba playing Jalabhar Xho or a major character from the Summer Isles.

Now here is where interpretation comes in. I've always interpreted Dorn as an amalgamation of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. My reasoning, the food, the mountainous region separating them from the remainder of the continent, complexion, buildings, and attire. The chance to use India as a backdrop for Dorn and the resources of Bollywood would be very exciting. Here's a question. Provided you accept the same interpretation would you use Indian actors with Indian accents, or English Indian actors with English accents? Here's an easy one for me to imagine Ben Kingsly as Prince Doran Martel and the Sand Snakes as beautiful Indian actresses.

Are the people of Myr, Asian in appearance, yes I realize India is in Asia as is Russia, you know what I mean? I've always imagined Taena Merryweather as being Asian having an appearance that really made her stand apart from the other ladies in waiting for Margery. On screen the contrast would have a visual appeal. Please offer all your own feelings on this discussion, which I guess is on the subject of what are expectations on upcoming character's appearances.

As to that. Christina Hendricks as Melisandre is terrible I couldn't imagine a worse choice for me at least. Below is a model on a magazine cover of what I believe Melisandre would look like given Davos description of her, who is the only man I trust in this and was of a woman who was terrifying and intimidating to him.

She's not really what I'd say is pretty in this picture though in others she is, but not ugly at all, intimidating is the word, and eyes you could never get a read on. This is the look I imagined she gave the Measter who tried to poison her.

2. What are the character's lifespans? Are they the normal lifespans of medieval people or longer? 

3. If the history of all the different kingdoms have existed for 12,000 years why have they never progressed past medieval level of technology or societal structure?

To me it's pretty obvious that Elmar's princess is none other than Arya. When he talks about the princess he's going to marry, he doesn't know he's talking to her, and she doesn't even know she's supposed to marry anybody.

However, in the last Arya chapter, Elmar is crying, and says that his house has been dishonored and that he's not going to marry his princess anymore.

Now, my question: am I supposed to know what all this means? As far as I know the marriage agreement still stands, but I might have missed something. Of course, it might also be the case that we're not supposed to know what's going on until later, and we are just left wondering until next book (maybe Robb married someone else, or the ""dishonor"" is not done by others but by the Freys themselves by renouncing the deal; I don't know).

So basically what I want to know is if I missed some detail, or if it's just a random clue for something else. Please no ASoS spoilers  I plan to start it this weekend (unless Rule 34 arrives, in which case I'll take a break from ASoIaF).",20,9,False,self,,,,,

Im very disappointed however, there is no wow factor, no sense of achievement it is pretty much a book that delays and delays. Gokus spirit bomb episodes come to mind. 

The book goes into every detail and keeps taking steps backwards. What is the justification of having a book this long? 

Nothing happens. 

There is no major breakthrough with the dragons

Some progress on the wall, 

No difference in Danys situation

The Dornish prince episodes were a complete and utter waste as he just dies with no significance. 

Aegon was just introduced without any prior hints, leading me to believe that hes just another attempt for the author to milk his franchise more. 

The whole book is essentially travelling, getting lost and then travelling. The destinations are the exact same as the last book with no progress. 

I swear I feel scammed. You might not agree with me and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but this man is no Tolkien and I feel like I just had to get this off my chest. Also, unlike his last books which were beautifully written this one is just endless pages of whining from the characters with the same exact problems and repetition with whole pages of him just listing off different tribes, sons, sell sword companies, etc.. 

For example, how many pages did we go through with Sons of Harpy being brought up with Dany saying the same thing and doing nothing. I counted 3 separate instances and then she made her choice. Or the whole sending help to Astapor, same dilemma, same conversation there goes 5 pages, and another. 

The wall, hey lets save these wildlings, then those ones, then these ones, were short on food, lets go count our food, lets count it again, we shouldnt trust wildlings, lets count our food 

It is just filler,

[This](http://i.imgur.com/FLtpG.png) is precisely why I'm considering dropping the series.  Don't get me wrong, it's been fun and I want to know what happens and all, but I just finished aSOS and I'm getting more and more disappointed.  I love politics, exposition and intrigue and if I wanted straight up action I'd go watch a shitty Michael Bay film, but I can only read so much of the same stuff over and over and over.

I guess I was actually expecting a *clash* of Kings in aCOK, but instead there are only a couple of important battles that we actually see and the rest are ""Oh did you hear?  Robb won the battle at X.""  More importantly though, I was disappointed with how everything turned out, namely the deus ex machina that is Melisandre.  Have two huge armies ready to fight with lots of potential outcomes (my favorite of which would have been them teaming up, but that's irrelevant)?  Better kill one of the kings with some random shadow shit.

And then there is aSoS.  I kept reading about how it was the best book in the series, that the action would pick up and et cetera so I was really excited.  I thought, well the Kings didn't really clash, but I guess mayhap there will be a storm of swords in this book.  And yeah, I guess there was to an extent, more so than in the other books, but there were maybe 3 or 4 huge events in 1200 pages?  I'd hardly call that a storm.

Finally, my biggest disappointment thus far has been Arya.  She was one of my favorite characters in GoT and I really wanted to see where aCoK would take her, which ended up being pretty much absolutely nowhere.  Then I thought, hey, maybe she'll actually do something in aSoS.  Nope - well save the very end, but even then she is back where she started, just wandering around with no real place to go.  I get that she is only around 10 so she can't exactly lead an army into battle, but *anything* would be better than her scrubbing castle floors and running from this group or that group *for two thousand pages*.

-I'm not a farmer, but I'm terrified of the thought of farmwork because it seems like hard manual labour and I'm sure I would hate that.  It also seems like in the rough and tumble world of the 7 Kingdoms, you pretty much have to farm, i.e.. sow your crops a lot or your entire population withers and dies.  The Greyjoys are such BAMFs that they don't need to do this, they can fish, collect tribute, whatever, anythings better than farming.

2. House Baratheon: *Ours is the Fury.*
-This is nice because it has a subtle little dig at the other Kingdoms.  Sure they may play the part and seem tough, but we, we are the real deal.  Plus these are one of the only words that actually sounds pretty cool.  Fury is a strong word.

3. House Tyrell: *Growing Strong.*
-Surprisingly high I know, but a little bit of modesty is a good thing in my opinion.  A bit like Winn-Dixie's ""Getting better all the time"" campaign.  They may not be the most powerful house yet, but they recognize that and as such, overconfidence will not be their downfall.  But they have high aspirations and will be dangerous on the horizon.

4. House Stark: *Winter Is Coming.*
-Dark, ominous and foreboding, quite good quite good, but come on.  It's already winter like 45% of the time in the 7 Kingdoms.  So half the time it's already winter so what good is wandering around growling ""winter is coming""?  ""Winter is already here you daft Starks! Summer is coming and can't come soon enough!"" Is what I would yell.

5. House Arryn: *As High As Honor.*
The Eyrie is quite literally, way up high in the mountains and honor is thought of a lofty principle.  You see what they did there?  It also has alliteration when seen if not pronounced.  And alliteration is usually awesome!

6. House Lannister: *Hear Me Roar!*
-You guys aren't literally lions you know.  This reeks of trying to hard.  I mean, check out the exclamation point at the end.  Oh they're yelling?  Cool I guess.

7. House Martell: *Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.*
-Hey lets take three synonyms that all start with 'b' and but 'un-' before each of them!  That will be really cool right?  No.  Not particularly.

8. House Tully: *Family, Duty, Honor.*

So forgive if I'm putting my foot in my mouth - this is not a snarky question, but a legitimate one.  **There are general, uncovered spoilers here - you are warned.**

When you get to the end of Feast for Crows, the final chapter points out that there was too much going on in this universe to contain in one book.  (Or at least it did in the Kindle version I downloaded.)

So has anyone considered that the two books together are essentially a 2,000+ page novel that took over a decade to write? That while some are complaining there's too much Essos and not enough Westeros in Dance with Dragons, that that was the point of this book?  You could just as easily say that FfC didn't have enough Essos or North, if you were interested in those characters.

Yes, there was a massive wait for this book.  But you knew at the end of FfC that the geography was going to be the opposite of DwD, and that you were rewinding the clock to a point at the end of Storm of Swords. 

Now, am I excusing the rather slow progress of Dany's story?  No - that POV could definitely had been well served by a tighter edit, I think.  I would have rather had more [DwD](/b ""Theon""), and perhaps a little more info on [DwD](/b ""Melisandre, as she is turning into a more important player"").

I don't know - it just seems as if this is the middle of the saga, and the characters are being moved around the board to prep for the climax.  As happens in most very long sagas.  It's inherently less interesting, but important in the overall arc.  And since you're looking at an arc, you need to kind of keep the books together, don't you?",3,9,False,self,,,,,

In fact, I did see it coming at the beginning of the chapter, but I just thought, ""No, they wouldn't do it. They are making a lot of noise about this wildling thing, but they'll shut the fuck up and do as their told ultimately. Besides, he hasn't been the Lord Commander for long enough to off him yet."" Silly me, right? 

But I am gonna go out on a limb here and say this- Jon isn't really dead. Or at least, he's not out of the story yet. The reason I think this is, when Ned and Robb died, it was tough to take but you could see that it made sense from a narrative/character development standpoint. Their stories had basically been told. Jon's death feels...anti-climactic. I felt the same way when I thought Arya died, and I also felt the same way about Mance Rayder's death. There is too much good story to tell with these characters to kill them so early. I didn't know how Mance survived that shit, but it was just premature, I knew he got out of it somehow. He was too interesting a character. Same thing with Arya.

So I think he either will survive somehow in Ghost, or Melisandre will save him Berric Dondarrion-style. By the way, Melisandre- WTF? Way to drop the ball on that. Didn't it occur to you to maybe elaborate on the ""daggers in the dark"" thing a little bit more? Maybe be a little more persistent? It might have been relevant, is all I'm saying. If I were working with a guy who as gonna lead a major part of the army that was going to defeat the winter demons bringing about the end of the world, I might have mentioned to him that someone was planning to kill him in cold blood. Just saying. 

* Mance Rayder is a fuckin gangster. I demand Mance Rayder PoVs in the Winds of Winter. 

* To Danaerys all I have to say to you is...him?

Thanks to the 42 people that voted!

First off, [here are the raw numbers.](http://i.imgur.com/18qtO.png)

Now let's take a look at what those mean.

**What did the majority say for each place?**

- **1st Place** - 92.1% said: **Storm of Swords** (DwD 5.3%; GoT 2.6%)
- **2nd Place** - 50.5% said: **Game of Thrones** (CoK 29.7%; DwD 9.2%; SoS 5.3%; FfC 5.3%)
- **3rd Place** - 58.4% said: **Clash of Kings** (GoT 20.5%; DwD 15.8%; SoS 2.6%; FfC 2.6%)
- **4th Place** - 47.4% said: **Dance with Dragons** (FfC 25%; GoT 18.4%; CoK 9.2%)
- **5th Place** - 67.1% said: **Feast for Crows** (DwD 22.4%; GoT 7.9%; CoK 2.6%)

If we average all the ranks the books got from the voters, we get their **average rank**:

- 1.11 - Storm of Swords 
- 2.78 - Game of Thrones
- 2.85 - Clash of Kings
- 3.72 - Dance with Dragons
- 4.54 - Feast for Crows

I'll comment on two things.

- Note the tight race between Game and Clash. Only 38.1% of people think that CoK is better than GoT - so why are the two so close?

Because readers seem to have a ~~love/hate~~ love/like relationship with Game. 26% of voters placed it either 4th or 5th - something only 11% of voters did with Clash.

- How about Feast and Dance?

Some people say they're two halves of the same book, some are very disapointed with Dance - some just want some motivation to get through Book 4. What do the numbers say?

Besides the higher average ranking that Dance got, **70.21% of people say things get better after book 4!**

Dance was the only book, besides Storm of Swords, to get more than 1 vote for 1st place.

The one I found for GoT was old and low quality (22 sides on cassette tapes!) but other than pronouncing a few characters' names strangely (BA-ra-THE-on instead of ba-RA-THEon), it was pretty good. The narrator really lent a pretty unique voice to each character. (Looked it up: Roy Avers)

But the narrator for CoK is unendurable. The biggest annoyance is his tendency to say each sentence. With frequent pauses. As if. Each group of words. Were a separate sentence. It's as if he treats each comma as a full stop, and every clause of each sentence is an independent thought. So we get things like ""A Song of Ice. And Fire. Book two. A Clash. Of Kings.""

And then despite having a British accent (specifically, the kind of British accent that says ""power"" as ""pah""), he for some reason gives several characters Irish accents or other bizarre choices. This is especially strange when some members of a family will have one accent while others, presumably raised together in the same area of the world, will have a completely different accent. Tyrion is Irish while Cersei and the rest of the Lannisters are English. Arya has some kind of Cockney accent while the rest of the Starks have a more typical British accent.

But then there's what he does to poor Ser Davos and Yoren and a few other characters. The narrator already sounds like he's about two hundred years old, the kind of stuffy old Englishman that you half suspect is actually a reanimated mummy, but when he reads Ser Davos' or Yoren's lines he adds in an insane lilt that makes them sound like creepy old men. For some reason, Ser Davos cackles at the end of every other sentence. Yoren talks with a juicy lisp as if he were talking around a huge wad of chewing gum or a mouthful of marbles; is the narrator trying to portray him as if he were chewing sourleaf?

Anyway, I won't be recommending anyone else listen to the audiobook version narrated by Roy Dotrice. (Just looked him up. Looks like he was originally cast as Pycelle before they got Julian Glover to do it. Glad they went with General Veers for that one.)",10,1,False,self,,,,,

(major spoilers through aDwD)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/j2sts/on_the_import_and_motivation_of_varys_and/,[deleted],1311905281,"I have to admit, I'm late to the party on this one. I read Game of Thrones and Storm of Swords years apart. I didn't pay close attention to Lysa's ranting  I simply forgot certain revelations in A Feast for Crows. So, when I was browsing Tower of the Hand a couple of days ago I was surprised to learn that Littlefinger was responsible for virtually all of Ned's storyline in the first book, and by extension brought the realm to a war that lasts two years and two books. Up until Feast, he has only a handful of scenes. Less observant readers, like myself, could likely miss this crucial story detail. If that's by design I can't say, but I suspect it is. It certainly would take a discerning reader to piece it all together by memory alone.

Much like Varys' storyline. Up until Dance with Dragons, there is only the hint of a whiff of his motivations to restore the Targaryens to their throne.

So let's try to get a clear picture of these two characters. Martin has so far done a good job of keeping the reader as confused about these two as the other characters are.

Lets discuss the following topics, and whatever else pops up:

How much of the events of the series were planned by these two?

What are their true motivations in the long run?

Does Littlefinger really regard Sansa as a daughter? Is he capable of affection or was he ruined by Catelyn?

What are their next moves?

Are they prepared for what's coming from the north and the east?

My opinion:

I think that Varys has a much better handle on what's really going on than Littlefinger. I think he's prepared for the mythic endgame. I think that when the Others descend, and Azor Ahai is reborn in Jon Snow or Daenerys, he'll be able to adapt to that.

Littlefinger, on the other hand is obsessed with the game of thrones. Soon, that game will be irrelevant. He's pretty much the poster boy for the ignorant and selfish game the petty lords are playing in the south. He's obsessed with a distraction and his downfall will be pretty spectacular.
