imagine if sansa received this letter (bellow) from cersei, how she'd react? and if you were in sansa's position how would you react.   

""Dear Sansa,    
Beside all our differences and our conflicts, Im pleased to write to the only sane person I still know ... I'm also happy to hear that your innocence has been proven from the murder of my son Joffrey, know that in my heart I've always knew that.     

You must have already learned that your half brother the king in the north is held prisoner in the red keeps dungeon under the queens orders, awaiting his trial for high treason and rebellion against the crown siding with a foreign and a would be usurper whose father killed your uncle, and brother kidnapped and raped your aunt Lyannan, a targaryen who is not any different from all the othersinstead of staying true to his duty to protect the kingdom and the crown and doing what his feelings for a foreigner have blinded him from doing.     

You're quite in a good position to turn the scales around and this time save a Stark.        
I swear to you that I will grant your brother a royal pardon and to free him... and I will make sure that house Stark gets away from this war with no harm but the respect of all the other houses. I only want one thing from you.    

 a little vial of a very powerful and discreet poison must have been given to you with this message, you only have to pour some drops of it in the queens drink or meat and stop something regrettable from even happening, so have the merit of having acted like a true northerner queen and a stark worthy of her name.    

Keep in mind that I can not give you more than three nights to think and actafter that the only thing youll receive are news of how your brother was screaming in pain while Sr Gregor was failing to decide how he's going to perform...I'm convinced you'll make the right choice."".

It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and waterwith which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metalssteel, copper, aluminum, etc.because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire.

Battle of the Bastards and Light of the Seven were so good it sucked me in completely, and I almost forgot I was watching them play it live. The stage art and happenings were so well orchestrated, and it really felt like I was IN the battles when they were shown on screen.

10) [Joffreys armour at Blackwater Bay](https://i.imgur.com/EC9ZcsL.jpg) a beautifully engraved set, with lions etched everywhere, its the best House Lannister has ever looked

9) [The Dornish soldiers](https://i.imgur.com/HBflr0b.jpg), a very different style of armour, suited to the Dornish climate and style of warfare, gives me very Moorish/Spanish/Middle Eastern vibes

8) [The goldcloaks](https://i.imgur.com/oCbf04j.jpg), very Ottoman inspired armour, fitting as Kings Landing is supposedly based on Constantinople and also very similar to other Baratheon armour

7) [Stannis and House Baratheon of Dragonstone](https://i.imgur.com/CREN9gZ.png), heavily armoured in plated mail, they look imposing and professional

6) [House Stark soldiers](https://i.imgur.com/UC47koa.png) Im a sucker for mail, and the Starks have a lot! A very weathered and northern look about these men, I like it

5) [House Tyrells heavy infantry ](https://i.imgur.com/KeZzeZc.jpg), professional, flashy and fabulous, these soldiers look like theyd get the job done in style

4) [The Hound](https://i.imgur.com/bIUYDwK.jpg), brutish and heavy, it fits the Hound perfectly, and he looks intimidating as hell wearing it

3) [Briennes first suit of armour](https://i.imgur.com/IH7Z93W.jpg), fluted and styled in a very unique way, this captures Brienne and the Stormlands martial nature in a very practical looking set including both plate and mail

2) [Ser Loras Tyrell ](https://i.imgur.com/lGWiwH0.jpg), the perfect knight in shining armour, he looks straight out of a fairytale. However, it still looks practical and is very close to historical plate armour 

1) [Ser Jorah Mormonts first suit](https://i.imgur.com/lR9QLgD.jpg), greyed plate from years of battle over fine mail, with northern style pauldrons and a unique look that seems like the Norths answer to knights, this armour has been my favourite since I saw.

So that was my list of my favourite armour, what do you think? What armour/costume do you like?

So, I recently attended an event called Throne\-fest. For what it was, it was okay, it received some negative reviews which is understandable. However, this truly made my day. Lets set the scene...

My sister wanted to sit on the Iron throne, so I agreed. At the time we went, the queue was huge. After about an hour, I was questioning leaving it, but I am glad I didn't! At around the hour and a half mark, we were close. In eye sight the excitement was kicking in. They had a huge dragon going past and it was such a good environment. Despite the huge queue everyone was chatty. Anyway, we were around 10 people behind to the Throne, and Dean walked past the queue. I immediately recognised him because of his hair. No one else did though, and not until his agent said that it was Tommen that people started getting excited \(which kinda annoyed me, but this isn't a rant\). The longest 7 minutes began of my life, trying to move closer to see him. I saw he engaged in a conversation with a woman, which showed how genuine he was. They then agreed something \(I couldn't hear\) and I could clearly see he was about to leave. I was genuinely so lucky and grateful I was in his path as he went to leave as it allowed me to get a photo. He is such a genuine guy and this truly made my day, I was so lucky as he didn't stay long. I am so grateful for a cast that cares. The Throne was quite far from where his tent \(for signing\) was, so he didn't have to do that. This was my second experience with a celeb, and he made it a truly memorable one.

My first experience was earlier that day with Tom Wlaschiha where he signed my Pop! Vinyl, where he was also very kind. He said 'Have you sat on the Iron Throne? They say it is a bad omen, everyone who sits on it dies' which made me laugh, but I am glad I didn't listen to him as i met Dean :D

Today I will be doing the two last Targaryens in the world (as far as I know) Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Now I have already done two already, One for Arya which I will link right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

And one for both Bran and Sansa Stark which I shall also link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8nbg4u/spoilers_my_predictions_for_bran_sansa_in_season_8/

Okay so last season saw Jon and Dany hook up on there way to the North on a boat and I believe this season will be about them coming to terms with the situation of Jon being a Targ. But however who will the North react well they will probably send Gendry first to let everyone know of there arrival. When Jon arrives to WF Jon and Dany will get looks from the Northern Lords and some of the Northern Small Folk (and not nice looks either) But Jon will get reunions with Sam, Ghost, Sansa, Bran, and a very heartfelt reunion from Arya. I also believe we will get some bounding scenes between Jon and Dany and we may get the revelation of Dany being pregnant when she sees a Maester about it. Anyways Jon will hold a meeting in the Great Hall to prepare for the battle, Though they will have made a plan the Northerners including Sansa and even Arya will give Jon smack for bending the knee.

Jon will also confront Arya about the Bag of Faces and what she and Sansa did last season, She will explain everything she had to go through and also that she was simply testing Sansa/Pushing her into not trusting LF. Anyways Jon will be told the truth by Bran, Sam, and Howland Reed (if Howland even shows up, which I sadly doubt he will at this point), Jon will have a lot of mixed emotions and not only tell the Stark sisters but also Dany and before Dany can even tell him she's pregnant the horn's go off signalling the WW's have come. Dany will take to her Dragon Drogon and fly off into battle while Jon will lead the armies on the ground. The battle is brutal and Jon will lose a lot of men (including Tormund, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern lords). He and Ghost will go in on the NK but NK will tear off Ghost head. Jon angered by this will charge at him but get surrounded by three WW's only to be saved by Jaime and Brienne.

Everyone will evacuate to the Riverlands and Jon will get revealed by Dany that she is pregnant, Jon will ultimately decide that they stay together for the child, not caring weather or not there Aunt and Nephew. Jon will also ride to the God's Eye to find out how to defeat the NK once and for all while Dany evacuates everyone to the Trident. Jon will be revealed by Bran once he is at the God's Eye that not only is his father Rhaegar AA/TPTWP and he is Lightbringer but also WW's have return due to a combination of...well if you read my predictions for Sansa and Bran I explain why. Anyways Jon is also told he must embrace his Targaryen side, Jon decides he is both a Stark and a Targaryen and ask Bran to warg into Rhaegal.

Meanwhile Dany goes into Labour alittle too Early but survives childbirth, giving birth to twins a boy and a girl (Rhaegar the II and Arya the I Targaryen). But she and her Drogon sense that the NK is near, she gets on Drogon and her and the NK and Viserion fight in the skies above the Trident with Dany leading him away to KL, Jon on Rhaegal joins in the fight as well. Viserion breaks Drogon's neck and Dany with Drogon fall from the skies, Dany is killed from the impact of the fall. Jon furious goes in on the NK and Rhaegal dies killing Viserion, the two land near the God's Eye. The two 1v1 with Bran trying to mess with NK's head by warging into him. Ultimately Jon gets the best of the NK and with help from Sam they pull out the Dragonglass from his chest, instantly killing him.

All the Wights Collapse and the WW's are turned back to human form. Jon learns of Dany's death Jon is chosen by the people to be king of the Seven Kingdoms and his first act is to melt down the Iron Throne and declare that there will no longer be one ruler ruling the whole seven kingdoms but a ruler for each kingdom, with them all working together. Jon will be forced to raise his children on his own with the Bittersweet ending being they one but Jon lost another lover and a lot of friends in the process.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If they are never certain who you are or what  you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the  best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even  seem to work against you. Remember that, Sansa, when you come to play  the game. 

I don't really think Littlefinger  just died that easy. this man was prepared for everything and mastered plot to get rid of a king and his hand. He had the balls to say to the hand

&gt; ""Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse."" 

He said this to Ned in his face so he knew that everyone shouldn't trust him, and what about being in the middle of winterfell among Sansa, Arya, Bran and knights of the Vale!

He knew the damage he did to Sansa, he heard what Bran said ""chaos is a ladder"" and this means Bran can see and hear everything including all his plots and lies. 

there was a woman talking to him and he gave her a coin, not sure its iron or silver, but it may be iron for it's just one coin and no one will pay in silver or gold in one piece, and if it's iron the woman must be from the faceless men, who can be hired to kill someone or to die for others.

I think he sensed the sensed the danger rising around him and knew that it's coming one way or other so he increased the tension between Sansa and Arya and gave them an image of himself to be slaughtered while he ran away. 

Here is one weak point that is Bran is here who sees everything, but maybe if that is true Bran would leave him as now Littlefinger isn't his biggest problem.

Every other character in the show is well developed and their abilities/characteristics that will affect the end game are established (Jon's leadership, Tyrion's intellect, Daenerys' dragons and their ""magic""). Yet, while we do know some of what Bran can do, we do not fully understand his power and therefore people seem to be struggle to see where he fits in the end game. We know he can see the past, present, and future (when he said the sea would flood Winterfell, and then Theon captured it). We know he has the ability to alter events in the past, even though the TER said the ink is dry, how else can you explain Hodor or young Ned turning around at the Tower of Joy? To me it is clear he is more powerful than the TER, but to what extent I'm unsure. I know there are a lot of theories about where Bran will come into play, but he has the widest range of theories due to the ambiguity of his powers and that which gives him these powers. I have read that some people believe Bran's abilities will somehow tie into the religious aspect of the story. Since religion plays such a vitally important role in advancing the story's plots, I truly believe that there will at least be some tying out of the religious powers on Westeros. Given that Bran can influence the past and see the future, it is clear he is vastly more powerful than any other character, we have already seen that he has the power of, I dare to say, a ""god"". I know if there is some kind of tie out for religion it will probably draw heavily from the ""it's just magic"" card, but I really hope it doesn't end with Bran just having special abilities everytime he touches a certain type of tree, I hope we get some more clarity than that. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on exactly how they could see this clarity being given through Bran's role in the endgame and if  this will involve tying out some of the unexplained religious events we have seen.",34,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now my evidence for this is first up, look at the order of when the houses side With dany and then when they are wiped out, Greyjoys are the first to side with Dany. Then Houses Tyrell and Martell. The order of who's getting wiped out goes backwards from this. House Martell and Tyrell have already gone extinct now it is only a matter of time until Greyjoy get there turn.

Also we know that Theon can't produce children, Euron will most likely die, Damphair has no real propose in the story, and Yara children would not be named Greyjoy. It has been foreshadowed for either Yara or Theon to die so maybe both die. Now how do I think they will die? Well...

Euron will be killed by Theon, Damphair will die at Eurons hands, Theon will be forced to put Yara out of her misery as she is now in her own Reek Persona, and Theon will die either saving Yara or protecting Bran and maybe Arya.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Both of their fathers died before their birth, and both of their mothers dies during childbirth.  

2\) Both were then smuggled away from their birthplace for the same reason, it wasnt safe for them. Daenerys to Essos, Jon to Winterfell. 

3\) While there they both lived as outcast. Dany because she was in exile, and Jon because he was a supposed bastard. Furthermore, they were both treated bad during their childhood, Dany by Viserys, and Jon by Catelyn.  

4\) They both lived in the shadow of their brother. Jon was always in the shadow of trueborn Rob Stark, heir to Winterfell and the North, and Jon also claimed he was Jealous of Rob his whole life. Daenerys was in the shadow of Viserys, who was the one true king of Westeros \(according to himself\) 

5\) Both Jon and Daenerys' life are forever changed because of a feast. For Daenerys, it is her wedding feast and for Jon it is the feast at Winterfell where he decides to join the Night's Watch. 

6\) They both struggle in their new life. Daenerys finds it hard to adapt to the savage Dothraki's way of life, and Jon has a hard time to become accepted by his new brothers of the Night's Watch.  

7\) Their first love parallels each other as well. Daenerys and Drogo  Jon and Ygritte. At first both Jon and Daenerys didnt really like their love, but after a while they started to generally love them. In the end they both died in their arms, and in both cases Daenerys and Jon were somewhat responsible for that.  

8\) They both dedicated their lives to save and help those who were refused. Daenerys was interested in helping free the slaves and keep them alive. Jon did all he could to help the Wildlings and save them for the Army of The Dead. Also, both are now fighting with Jon and Daenerys. The wildlings are fighting with Jon  for example in the Battle of the Bastards and the unsullied, who were the former slaves are fighting with Daenerys not by force but because they want to. 

9\) Both Jon and Daenerys are the ones to bring back the magical animal sigils of their house, Jon was the one to convince Ned to keep the direwolf pups, and Daenerys literally brought back dragons. 

10\) Both Jon and Daenerys were given the chance to get what they always wanted, but both refused to do what they believed was right and because of their morals. Jon was offered by Stannis to be legitimised, and Daenerys was offered ships and money to sail to Westeros for the throne. 

I'm sure there's many many more!

Did John Snows sword Longclaw actually blink?

How does Benjen conveniently show up to save both Bran and John?

How are all of these connected?

To start things off I would like to set a base of general assumptions that can be made based of what the story has offered so far up until season eight.

Bran has the ability to time travel and is somehow connected to the Knightking because the Knighting was able to see him when Bran was traveling through time.
The children made white walkers during the war against the first men to combat the first men and their destructive tendencies.
The white walkers were men that were created as a weapon for children of the forest.
After the scene where bran travels back in time to the first white walker being made, later that episode it alludes to the fact that the white walkers had fulfilled the task that would bring them out of existence (destroying the first men). This is accomplished in the scene where bran is next to theWeirwoodwhere the scene takes place in winter and the army of the dead is at the tree. It is assumed the war against the first men is over because its winter and the first men had been destroyed so why would the white walkers return to the tree of their creators ,the children of the forest, other than to have their curse removed. The night king and his followers are searching for an end to their existence yet are at a standstill at this point in time. Their purpose is exhausted at this point in time and this is where they wait for Bran. They have no goal until they make contact with Bran which gives a sense of where he is in the physical and temporal. This shows there is some similarity in the magic that the Kinghtking and Bran utilize.

Bran, the knightking, Benjen, and John Snows sword are all aligned with each other in some sense to make a profound ending to relieve the whites from their curse.

Benjen was turned into a walker and was turned back into a man through the children of the forest. Benjen is not acting out of self-interests which raises concern about the magic or superior force that is communicating with him to save two pivotal characters in the story not only once but twice. The first being when he saves bran from the white walkers and the second when he saves john snow from the walkers. If he is somehow correlated with the same magic the white walkers embody that means that the controlling force of that magic wants both of those characters alive for a particular reason. In the scene where John is fighting a white and surprisingly deflects the strike of a walker the walker is significantly surprised that the sword prevented his strike. I believe this is to assert the power and role the sword has to play in some sort of prophecy. Could it be that Bran and John snow or his sword have a role to play to end the suffering of the knightking in some ultimate sacrifice or prophecy?

This is all in addition to the fact that The Lord of Light (the only religion in this show to be proven true) also wants John Snow alive. They say they dont know why this is, but it must be for the same reason the force controlling Benjen saves John Snow. His prophecy must end up being to save mankind, which would entail stopping the curse of the White Walkers which would free both the Knight King as well as mankind. All in all, whatever the prophecy is to end the suffering of the Knight King, it requires John Snow and Bran to be alive, for now
Basically the whole series is about the Knight King wanting to relieve his curse. For the past however many years, the Knight King has repeatedly traveled South every winter to attempt to relieve his curse. For some reason, the time frame we are watching contains characters that will make his journey South different this time. There has to be something we dont know about that is the key to breaking the curse of the Children.

What are some of your opinions or references that might contribute to why the Knight King would need both John and Bran alive? Where does Khaleesi come into all of this? What role exactly does Benjen play? What would end the curse?

I may be completely off on these assumptions, but if I am then Game of Thrones has huge plot holes to it, major ones being that a character (Benjen) we see only in the first episode comes back randomly to save the two most important characters of the show from Whites. Coincidence? I think not

Arya/Gendry besides Jon/Dany and Jaime/Brienne is my Favorite shipping in Game of Thrones mainly because it has been setup a lot (especially in the show), unlike most shippings it would make sense from a storytelling perspective, and overall they seem to trust each other. But however for the books I think we could see a love triangle between Arya Stark, Gendry Waters/Baratheon, and Young Griff/Aegon the VI Targaryen (Blackfyre). 

I believe in the show next season we will see a possible romance between Arya and Gendry, and in the books we could see a love triangle between Arya, Gendry, and Aegon. Now what is my evidence for this, well...i'll start with Gendry:

- Arya and Gendry have been friends and with each other for awhile now and in the show Arya says the line ""I can be your family"" in which Gendry replies ""you would not be my family. You would be my lady"". The actress who plays Arya was told to say it if she was telling him ""I love you"".

- Arya and Gendry seems to trust each other

- Robert told Ned that he had a son and Ned had a daughter they would join houses. yes that was meant for Joffrey and Sansa though it could also be seen as forshadowing for Arya and Gendry.

- There marriage would bring full circle the idea of a Baratheon marrying a Stark.

There are many other reasons I could get into right now but I will stop here, Now let's get to Aegon:

- Both Aegon and Arya know what it's like to be afraid, be hunted, and be the hunter.

- Both have also have been shaped to rule since they could walk (though with Arya is harder to see but if you look deeper into it, it makes alittle more sense).

- A Marriage between Aegon and Arya would be full circle with Rhaegar and Lyanna (yes I knows Aegon is most likely a Blackfyre but nobody knows he is one though)

- Also it would grant Young Griff control of the North, If Arya reunites with her family.

- In the Maggy the Frog prophecy it is said a more beautiful queen will cast Cersei down, and I believe Arya is that more beautiful queen (though I don't think Young Griff is the Valonqar, he could be Jaime's Valonqar but not Cersei's. Jaime would be Cersei's Valonqar). Yes I do think Arya will grow up to be as beautiful as Lyanna.

- It is stated Dany has one last betrayal, the one for love. Perhaps if Aegon falls in love with Arya that will be the betrayal for love. 

- Now how would they meet idk.

Now in conclusion I think it is definitely possible we could see a romantic love triangle between the three. Do I think it will happen? No I think Arya will end up with Gendry (especially in the show) and Young Griff will end up with Sansa. But I think the love triangle idea is possible.",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well Jamie last saw Cersei at the neck of Westeros and himself at the Fingers \(see the picture below\). the Valonqar prophecy states ""And when your tears have drowned you, the **Valonqar** \(Jamie\) shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat an**d choke the life from yo**u"", as we leave King's Landing we see Jamie in all black covering his golden hand \(the one in this theory would have killed Cersei, and would dissolve his Lannister name\). and why would Jamie do all of this? well, throughout his story Jamie has been on a path to change his former self by doing good and \(not by his own hand\) loosing his tool that killed the King and raped his sister. So killing Cersei would disprove the myths that Jamie had insest with his Sister or that he killed the King just for himself and most importantly that he is not a Lannister the family that started this whole mess.

Next, I just don't like the hate for Cersei from the fandom. This isn't exactly the problem with the show, but I think they could have made her more easy to sympathise with. I think she's the most interesting and well-performed character on the show, and the fandom should see from her precarious position.

168,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-6-4,2018,6,4,7,8ocg6s,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Can we talk about Sandor and the mountain in the dragon pit season 8?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ocg6s/spoilers_can_we_talk_about_sandor_and_the/,Binghiev,1528066576,"So I just read the theory by /u/440k that Sandor says to the hound that he knows what is coming for him because he saw his death in the flames as a child. 

My guess on this is that there is a lot that could actually lead to this theory not only being true but also extend it a little. So hear me out, put your tinfoil on and let's go.

So it all starts with Sandor seeing the death of the mountai in the flames as a child. In response to this Gregor Turns completely nuts and pushes Sandor in the flames. But at this point how would Sandor know that he can trust the vision? He could think that it was nothing and just troll his brother little.

I think he doesn't understand until he sees the vision in season 8 and it is confirmed for him that he can trust them as suicide squad reaches the spikey Hill and the army of the dad is actually there. In this moment it snaps for him and he is absolutely sure that the flames showed him the actual death of Gregor and that he can trust the visions. 

Now in season 8 there are two scenes that make me suspicious about how Gregor actually dies. Here comes the tinfoil part. Sandor did not only see Greg die but he saw Arya kill him. We know that Brienne is a tough girl and able to defeat the hound. And in season 8 we learned that Arya is insane with her assassin's abilities so that she was able to beat Brienne in a sparring. For me this is serious foreshadowing that the mountain could be defeated by Arya. 

Moreover he actually is on her list and the hound knows this I mean... There has to be some connection. 

The second big red flag for me was when the hound and Brienne met in s8. They talk about Arya and he learns that she has become very good with the sword, he does not seem suprised by that. This just proofs even more the vision he saw as a child and that they were real. 

In the end the questions remaining are why the Lord of light wanted Sandor to see this and why Arya has to kill the mountain. Another question is if the hound purposefully wanted to keep Arya alive because to some extend he believed in the vision.

 focusing on listening for history and foreshadowing... havr some quick questions, then some.random musings..


In regards to.the Tower of Joy, Jon Snow &amp; Ned stark 
* what do the common folk think happened to Lyanna? She just died?
* everyone in the realm knows who need stark.is and thst he's honorable, even ones thst don't follow politics.. who do the common folk think is the mother of lord eddards bastard son?
* during RR, why didn't elia and her two children flee to dragonstone with the young (I'm sure bratty) Viserys, and mad kings preggo wife (with daenyrs)?


What's truly amazing is how much information they give out in season 1. And it's very well told IMO.. It's subtle and worked into dialog... besides bran asking for scary stories from old nan, you learn a ton of.history in season 1. 
* I often wonder though if people who are watching for the first time, and don't know the names rhagar, Lyanna, battle of trident and the burning of.neds older.brother and dad (this.is.one of.the few.history items that is repeated, most are.one off convos) --- *would they pick up on the history*??

* they say Tywin was fierce and cunning before we even met him. Also said he was hand of the king for 20 years. They also mention he sacked the city 
* almost seems like people know about Jon 
* Jamie was being a prick to the dude  (jory?, meds right hand man in KL) he ended up stabbing in the eye.. they share war stories and talk.about Thoros of Myr breaking the pike siege by running right through it (and in the most recent season he had his flaming sword..and admitted he was drunk. Well no shit)
* They tell lots of stories like little finger talking about dueling Brandon and learning he couldn't play their game, or varys telling us how he lost his man hood and traveled with thespian (can't remember Essex/bravo word for actor/performer), learning Theo's story.. they mentioned ward Like one maybe twice.. then in a later episode, tyrion gave us more info before bending rod over. His father balon mention onky once 

There are more.subtle.ones but they escape me currently
* 

Also tons of foreshadowing and hints,
* girl in tub with Viserys talka.about faceless men
* multiple Jon Snow is special moments thst didn't notice the first two times

Both of their fathers died before their birth, and both of their mothers dies during childbirth.   
* Both were then smuggled away from their birthplace for the same reason, it wasnt safe for them. Daenerys to Essos, Jon to Winterfell.  
* While there, they both lived as outcast. Daenerys because she was in exile, and Jon because he was a supposed bastard. Furthermore, they were both treated bad during their childhood, Daenerys by Viserys, and Jon by Catelyn.   
* They both lived in the shadow of their brother. Jon was always in the shadow of trueborn Rob Stark, heir to Winterfell and the North, and Jon also claimed he was Jealous of Rob his whole life. Daenerys was in the shadow of Viserys, who was the one true king of Westeros \(according to himself\)  
* Both Jon and Daenerys' life are forever changed because of a feast. For Daenerys, it is her wedding feast and for Jon it is the feast at Winterfell where he decides to join the Night's Watch.  
* They both struggle in their new life. Daenerys finds it hard to adapt to the savage Dothraki's way of life, and Jon has a hard time to become accepted by his new brothers of the Night's Watch.   
* Their first love parallels each other as well. Daenerys and Drogo  Jon and Ygritte. At first both Jon and Daenerys didnt really like their love, but after a while they started to generally love them. In the end they both died in their arms, and in both cases Daenerys and Jon were somewhat responsible for that.   
* They both dedicated their lives to save and help those who were refused. Daenerys was interested in helping free the slaves and keep them alive. Jon did all he could to help the Wildlings and save them from the Army of The Dead. Also, both are now fighting with Jon and Daenerys. The wildlings are fighting with Jon  for example in the Battle of the Bastards. The unsullied, who were the former slaves are fighting with Daenerys not by force but because they want to.  
* Both Jon and Daenerys are the ones to bring back the magical animal sigils of their house, Jon was the one to convince Ned to keep the direwolf pups, and Daenerys literally brought back dragons.  
* Both Jon and Daenerys were given the chance to get what they always wanted, but both refused to do what they believed was right and because of their morals. Jon was offered by Stannis to be legitimised, and Daenerys was offered ships and money to sail to Westeros for the throne.

You might already know these, but I've only just started picking up on them.

Leitmotifs are used often, like the melancholy Stark theme playing when Ice is melted down, then taken over by The Rains of Castamere as Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail are forged. After Cersei blows up the Sept, her theme changes to incorporate the Light of the Seven alongside her Rains of Castamere.

Both Joffrey and Tommen have similar themes to King Robert's ""The King's Arrival"", with Joffrey having ominous strings in ""You'll be Queen one day"" and Tommen having a solemn choir taken over by an orchestra in ""First of his Name"".

One of my favourite examples is Dany's ""The Winds of Winter"" which starts out with the Greyjoy theme, replaced by all of Dany's themes, from the Dothraki ""Blood of My Blood"" to the Unsullied and dragon theme ""Dracarys"" and the main theme.

Two other amazing examples are the two parts of ""Spoils of War"" from S7. They have themes from the Rains of Castamere to Light of the Seven to the Dothraki warhorns, and ""What is Dead may never Die"" from Season 2, when Theon travels back home. It starts with the Stark theme, then drums join as it fades to the Greyjoy theme as Theon looks over to the Iron Islands.

I could go on forever about this, but what are some other recurring leitmotifs you noticed?",3,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've noticed that she has the most haters probably than any other character on the show, considering that she isn't a villain.

I've always loved sansa. She was a young girl that was spoiled and had vision of how her life was supposed to be. And she was very naive and unable to stand up for herself. Yes she's had a very slow learning curve but she has learned and she is growing stronger. She is very young and has been through a lot of loss, torture and humiliation and has not done anything to be cruel and yet people hate her. And Ned didn't die b/c of her, she thought Joffrey would spare him if he pledged his loyalty. She had no way of knowing that he would behead him! I mean hell, even Cersei, his own mother, was unable to predict that.
Sansa has been tortured, beaten and raped at such a young age. And has grown strong through it all, sure it took time, but IMO she's the most realistic character. She has no dragons, no men to fight for her, no boyfriend/husband that she truly loves and she literally was separated from her family until end of s6.

The man was a monster, and absolutely deserved to die. Arya could not kill all the monsters in the world (either directly or indirectly), but she could have that particular one killed, and so she did. I applaud her choice.
Her reasons for choosing Weese were more personal, as he was the man who she reported to as a slave-in-all-but-name at Harrenhal, and who abused her daily. She does feel ""buyer's remorse"" for this one, and decides that she should use the kill for some more important political figure, but Jaqen kills Weese before she can change her mind. But I wouldn't call even this kill a waste: there's nothing wrong with Arya wanting someone who beats her bloody everyday to die.
She names Jaqen himself as her third victim in order to get his cooperation for freeing Northern prisoners in Harrenhal, who then take over Harrenhal from the Lannisters. In one sense, this is the most valuable use of her three wishes - but in another, it's the only one that's really a waste in the long term, as the political coup would have happened even without her help: the Northern prisoners were working with Vargo Hoat (who had joined forces with Roose Bolton) to take over Harrenhal anyway, and all Arya's plot did was to speed up the process a bit. Arya doesn't even get anything positive out of it - she recognizes that Roose Bolton is not to be trusted, and wisely decides not to reveal herself to him.

Consensus belief is Arya wasted her 3 kills, and  for a long period of time  I thought the kills should be Geoffrey, Tywin, and Cersei.

However, if this happened then perhaps Daenyrs doesnt form an alliance with Jon Snow and Westoros has to deal with the army of the dead AND Daenyrs.   So I ask you:

1. Who did you want initially killed?


2.  Would you pick the same people today?

Im not sure what my difficulty is as I dont THINK Im a poor reader. Some of my favorite books are The Name of the Wind (Patrick Rothfuss) and Andrezj Sapkowskis writings, which I think are subtle stories which require attention to detail to fully understand. 

Just wondering if anyone had any thoughts. Im in my 20s and have been a bookworm all my life. Ill also post this to the r/books subreddit as maybe my difficulty has more to do with GRR Martins writing style.

* ***Both Cersei and Daenerys futures were revealed to them through magic*** \- Daenerys sees a slew of visions, which is likely foreshadowing future events. Most notably, Daenerys sees the throne room covered in snow. Cersei visits Maggy the Frog, who tells her that she will marry the king and become the queen. This came true when she married Robert Baratheon. The witch also says that she will have 3 children, all of whom will die, this also came true as well. During the show, Cersei has let her prophecy affect her mental state much more so than Daenerys has.
* ***Both Cersei and Daenerys were forced into arranged marriages to further the family name***  in Cersies case, Tywin Lannister married her to Robert Baratheon after he claimed the Iron Throne. Whats interesting is that the only reason Cersei is in the position she is in now is because of her marriage to Robert. If she did not marry Robert and live through his death and the death of her children, she wouldnt be sitting on the throne right now. Like Cersei, Daenerys endured an arranged marriage to further her families name. Viserys married Daenerys to Khal Drogo, as Viseryss plan was to command the Dothraki and take back the Iron Throne. 
* ***They are both products of in\-breeding, like a lot of characters *** almost all Targaryens are were inbred. In Daenerys case, the Mad King \(Aerys II\) married his sister, Rhaella. Rhaella then has Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys. Cersei, on the other hand, is the product of cousins. Tywin Lannister married his cousin  Joanna Lannister
* ***Both Daenerys and Cersei use firepower when backed against a wall***  Daenerys had 3 dragons \(now 2\), the first time we see Daenerys use firepower is in the House of the Undying. Pyat Pree had Daenerys in chains, until she ordered her dragons to set him aflame. From that point on, Daenerys has used her dragons quite a bit. Like Daenerys, Cersei also uses firepower when backed against a wall. Cersei saw no way out of her trail with the High Sparrow, this caused her with the help of Qyburn to blow up the Sept and major portion of Kings Landing. Whats interesting though is Daenerys firepower is often seen as a power move, which leave people to root for her. Cerseis firepower is seen as evil. 
* ***Both has Gotten savage revenge on their enemies***  Daenerys burned Mirri Maz Duur at the stake, who used blood magic to kill Daenerys unborn child and put Khal Drogo in a vegetative state. Cersei got revenge on Unella, the Shame nun, by pouring wine on her and, well who knows what the Mountain could have done to her. Cersei also got revenge on Ellaria Sand, who killed her daughter Myrcella with poison. The difference here, is Cersei takes much more pleasure taking revenge on her enimies.
* ***Both Daenerys and Cersei have asked Jon Snow to bend the knee***  in season 7, they both sent letters to Jon Snow, which asked Jon Snow to bend the knee \(not that polite though\). Cersei asked Jon to bend the knee to his rightful queen or suffer the fate of all traitors. This is an obvious call back to Ned Stark, as Ned was beheaded once considered a traitor. The true difference between the letters is that Cersei was upfront with her desire for Jon Snow to bend the knee, while Daenerys got Jon Snow to come to Dragonstone before demanding this. It is worth noting though that Tyrion sent the letter on Daenerys behalf, which could explain why it wasnt as demanding. 

Here's a nice image to go with it:

New to this subreddit and its spoiler system so not sure if I got the tag right. There are no spoilers in this post but there are in the wikis and their annotations.

I've been working on something I think you'll all find very intriguing: converting articles from the [Westeros](http://awoiaf.westeros.org), [Ice and Fire](http://iceandfire.wikia.com), and [Game of Thrones](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com) wikis into annotations on [xyAnnotations](https://annotations.xyfir.com/sets/42451), which can be integrated directly into ebooks and viewed in just about any ebook reader. It's really neat being able to just tap on a name or phrase or location within a book and have the wiki articles already loaded and available to view right there.

I made a [short video](https://youtu.be/0j7Ly8_vg6Y) demonstrating it in action, and if you'd like to give it a try, I'd recommend starting [here](https://annotations.xyfir.com/sets/42451/read). I've also been working on creating annotations from other wikis for these and other popular books. You can see some of the annotations on my [xyAnnotations profile](https://annotations.xyfir.com/users/1).

As you can see, I've got a large part of the main articles transferred over, thanks to the [automated tool](https://github.com/Xyfir/annotate/tree/master/cli) I built. However, because it _is_ automated, there are some things that aren't quite right and I'd love to get some help improving the converted annotations. I need to do things like remove annotations that will never be highlighted within books, remove sections that are not relevant in the annotation format, fix searches so that more aliases are highlighted within books, and much more. Additionally, I also need help adding books, their covers, and their metadata to the xyAnnotations books database.

I'm a moderator on all of the ASOIAF and GRRM books and annotation sets on xyAnnotations so I can accept your changes or even make you a moderator as well if you're willing, able, and trustworthy. It'd be great to have some of the trusted members here moderating the related books and sets of annotations on xyAnnotations. There are a lot of books and series and authors I'm working on annotating so it's hard for me to properly manage all of these annotations and books without any help.

So if any of the ASOIAF fans or scholars here are interested in helping out, just let me know and I can point you in the right direction. If you're just looking to get these annotations into your ebooks and are having trouble, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.",1,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

His goal is to restore his own humanity and reverse the curse the Children of the Forest put on him.  In order to do this, he needs to destroy the magic that binds him to this curse.  The only way to do this is to destroy the Three-Eyed Raven and the CotF.  This has always been his goal, but it has not been even remotely possible to actualize until the end of season 1 when he sees the red comet, signaling the presence of fire magic (dragons) again in the world, giving him hope that he could finally complete his mission of destroying the wall and moving south to the Gods Eye (where it all started).  So, he makes the TER his first priority and mobilizes his army to the Weirwood tree north of the wall.  

The Three Eyed Raven was always going to be the first step in completing the Night King's goal of revenge and restoration, which is why the TER has been protected by the Children of the Forest (and magic) for centuries. The TERs warging and greenseeing abilities (not to mention being a source of magical power for the CotF) make TER the biggest initial threat to the NK. Only with the TER out of the way can the NK take on the CotF and accomplish his goal.  So, the NK attacks the Weirwood in season 6, destroying Brynden Rivers and is now after the new TER, Bran Stark. 

The Battle of Winterfell will be about protecting Bran (and ultimately the CotF who now reside on the Isle of Faces).  Most of the wights and WW are destroyed, and there will be many deaths in this battle, but the NK will leave several survivors; his intent is not to kill for killings sake. Bran, however, will die. NKs intent for the dragon, Viserion, becomes clear as he can now get across the water to the Isle of Faces, where he hopes to confront the last CotF and restore his humanity.  

This is where I believe the NK will be destroyed by Jon Snow, most likely fulfilling the prophecy of Azor Ahai.  JS must forge his sword in fire, which is Daenaryss heart.  Then, he is able to kill the NK, protecting the CotF.

Just opening up my predictions for discussion.  Any further thoughts?  Thanks!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

***""And a coat of Gold, a coat of red, a lion still has claws. And mine are long and sharp my lord, as long and sharp as yours.""***\&lt; Is this the Lannister responding to the Lord? Saying that even though their coat is red, they're still the same as the Lord of Castamere's. He's saying that his family is as strong as the Lord's.

**And so he spoke, and so he spoke; that Lord of Castamere** \&lt; So this is the Lord Of Castamere going off on the Lannister, seemingly angry at the Lannister's claim. He's shouting and shouting at the Lannister.

Will the finale season explain the Lord of Light concept once and for all? Is the Lord real, or are the fire visions just magic or spells of some sort? Is the LOL (lord of light this post) a good entity or an evil one? IF LOL is good, than is the many faced god the bad god, like the devil?

My thoughts: I think that we will find out that the LOL has some kind of physical form, like someone is actually the LOL. I've also thought in the past that the LOL is really an evil entity or bad god, like the devil, because remember that black demon thing that the Red Priest birthed in front of Ser Daavos? That was definitely something evil. So maybe the LOL is really the night king or some other evil thing. LOL sounds good because light=good usually, but I think that is to deceive us. I back this ""devil"" theory up with an example from biblical stories: remember Lucifer means light, satan used to be the most beautiful angel of light in heaven until he fell from god's grace. So maybe the LOL thing is an adaption of the devil concept. If this is true, than who/what represents the good? Jon Snow? I mean he has been resurrected just like Jesus Christ was. He is good through and through and has been a savior to many people already.

This is my theory.  I want to hear all of yours!",15,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Game of Thrones writers included these mechanisms to some degree so I was just thinking of a few that may pay off at some point...some things that could factor in the final episodes...

1) A little earlier someone questioned ""who will be brought back as a White Walker?"" Good question and since we have seen the NK dramatically raise people from the dead including some Wildlings at Hardhome we liked. I think dramatically it would be cool and also make sense for the story for him to raise a character we all know and love as one of his servants. So I think at some point we may see a major character die onscreen during the war with the NK and come back and another character that (might have loved them) have to battle them. 

2) Faceless men - we have characters who can take faces and identities. I think at some point some character will switch (or have been switched out) to dramatic effect. Maybe Arya uses a disguise we don't realize until the last minute as she pulls something off or maybe Jaqen shows up one last time. But I think something could turn out to be not as it seems and allow for a fun sequence using this tool. A lot of time has been sent explaining what it means to be no one so I'd like to see how it works in practice. Its also possible someone has been 'no one' all along. (tin foily but isn't that the point of having disguises)

3) Time travel - Bran effected Hodor and he was the way he was in part because of Bran. I do think this will come to pass in some form that Bran using his abilities will have already caused (accidentally or even on purpose) something that is occurring in the past that leads to the current events in an important way. it will be confusing but I think anything Bran has done has already been done (the ink is dry, as the Three Eyed Raven pointed out) but that doesn't mean Bran wasn't the one who wrote it from the present. So I do think we will get a moment where some things link together through Bran.

4) Beric - We know how his story and Catelyn's was changed from the books. I do think at some point the lord of lights ability to resurrect will be used one final time on a needy character.

5) Warging - The wolves have been given some short shrift which is a shame because I would have liked to see Drogon meet Ghost. But warging with animals is something we have seen earlier on but hasn't really had a major impact on the narrative so far with the changes they have made to eliminate some of it but it has been clearly explained and set up. Many thought Jon would escape his death at the Wall using warging but he didn't. I think the elements are there for it to be used one last time in the show either to call for help or to give a character one last shot at life by warging into another being.  

6) Wolves - speaking of wolves, this might not be likely, we know the CGI budget isn't big enough for dragons and wolves apparently and fur is a nightmare to render but I do hope the wolves show up in the end and bring the story full circle in a big showing. Not so much a concept that can lead to a story point like the others, just something cool that has been set up (sparingly) that I think could pay off in the final battle. Hopefully they get together some budget for the wolves to come riding in at some point.

And its a new thread- lol! :P

GRRM is so good at fleshing out characters. he creates intrigue in a variety of ways with descriptors that beg to be studied further. I especially love his profuse use of handicaps, or physical detriments in his characters, that imo illustrates a world where people are damaged and carry burdens. He's also fantastic at playing with tropes and even further has an genuine gift for evolving characters in fantastic ways in a method that still makes their development plausible and believable. I am enamored with his character creations!!

So my question is what minor characters have you heard about that you want to get the full GRRM on? Ive got one but its pretty vague and I was going to hold on to it until I heard a few from other people on here. Hint: its pretty obscure- think he gets a paragraph or two in DWD in a daenarys chapter- lol! Also he gets more ink but Im really sucked into the Roose Bolton mystery and still fanatically holduing out for the ""Bolt-On Theory"" to come true, at least in ink (where all the best stuff happens).

Anyways Im currently on my 3rd full read and am more sucked into this world than ever- haha! Ftr I strongly reccomend a second read as soooo much really comes through the second time. Im only reading it a third time because his prose and storytelling are like heroin fopr me now :P Im doing the King of Thorns triolgy and I keep picking up DWD instead- lmao!!

I just rewatched the final episode of Season 7 and I can't help but really wonder what deal Tyrion and Cersei struck to allow Cersei to let Tyrion walk out of that room without being murdered in cold blood.

It's got to be something big, right? Because we know Cersei has no intention of honoring any deal they made and I assume Tyrion knows this. He had to have offered her something that he believes she would actually take and that Dany would actually agree to.

Because of this, we know it can't involve Cersei staying in power. That's not going to happen as Dany would never agree to it.

We also know it can't possibly involve Dany taking the throne as Cersei would never agree to it and, if she did, Tyrion would automatically call BS and know she was lying.

Maybe he agreed that Cersei, Jamie and their child gets to live when Dany takes control? I doubt this would work because Tyrion knows Cersei will never give up power and would die trying to keep the thrones.

So what is it then? 

Is Tyrion going to take out Jon Snow? To me, that seems like a true possibility as he would see it as a strategic move to placate Cersei but ultimately not cost Dany the crowd. And it's vengeful enough that I could believe Tyrion thought Cersei would find that an acceptable deal.

Or maybe Tyrion has pledged to allow Cersei's child to take the throne after Dany? There was a lot of talk about succession in Season Seven between those two characters. 

We know Tyrion isn't going to turn on Dany (at least not at this point.) We know Cersei won't trust or fear Dany so what deal could possibly work for everyone involved?

First off, Crasters home is pretty far away from the Land of Always Winter. WWs could steal babies much easier from wilding settlements closer like the Thann. Also, it seems like the point of grabbing the babies is that they are alive (otherwise they would become Wights not WWs) and the logistics of this means that the babies have to be picked up by WWs relatively soon after Craster leaves them. How would the NK know a few days ahead of time that Crasters daughter is about to give birth, so one of the WWs should leave now to be around Crasters Keep in a couple of nights to grab the child? Also, how would they know it was going to be boy and not a girl? This whole situation implies a lot. We know that WWs are not wandering around regularly near the wall, because at the beginning very few Rangers are really taking the rumours of WWs seriously. This all really makes sense if the NK has greensight, otherwise, I just dont understand how they could have a WW in the right place, at the right time. I also think the fact he chooses Crasters children instead of just pillaging wilding settlements really proves the theory that the WWs are way more than just mindless tools of destruction. It would be annoying to battle with your neighbours and steal their children. It might even result in them trying to rescue said children, so the WWs obviously think the easiest path is to just take the unwanted children Craster provides. Again, if destruction is your game then you wouldnt value life and wouldnt care either way. 

Also, how did the whole situation come about? I doubt the NK showed up at Crasters one day asking if he could have his sons going forward and then they had some nice southern wine and watched the fire for a bit. The most likely theory is that Craster starts putting the sons out simply because he is trash bag of a human being, and then one morning someone notices that the babys body is gone. Craster is curious about what happened (or paranoid that one of the daughters snuck out and saved it) so the next time he waits after he drops the baby. He sees the WW grab it. This is where I think it went two possible ways. The least likely is that Craster actual has a convo with the WW about the babies, and the WW promises that if Craster continues to sacrifice babies he will be spared in the upcoming war. The more likely theory is that the WW says nothing, but also doesnt try to kill Craster, just turns around and leaves with the child. Craster is a fool, so he assumes that they are gods (wildings seem more willing to believe the magical nature of things) and that sacrificing his children must be pleasing them. He runs with this assumption going so far when the Nights Watch shows up to brag that he will be spared in the coming war. So Craster just creates his pact with the WWs from his own assumptions/imagination. 

Either way the whole situation with Craster sticks out to me as very odd. All we see (especially in the show) is the repeated narrative that WWs are this undead zombie army that just wants to destroy. Even one of the GOT show creators said recently that the NKs just wants death. Yet, with Crasters baby swap they employ serious restraint by choosing to take Crasters given children instead of stealing wilding babies. It also proves they are able to employ some level of greensight and organization/planning. If they are just about destroying then why would they act like rational beings with a planned purpose only when it comes to Crasters children? 

I have one more tin-foil theory about the whole thing. In my search for answers, I found out that Craster is the bastard son of a wilding woman and member of the Nights Watch. It said somewhere that the mother went to Castle Black and tried to get the father to take responsibility but she was chased off. You never find out who the father was. The Nights Watch has a long history of random nobles ending up there. Could it be that there is something about Crasters blood? The Red Witch was a big believer in the power of royal blood, and there are a lot of parallels between the Red Witch and the WWs. Maybe the reason they want Crasters children is because of their blood, because their blood allows them to turn into WWs when touched? The Starks, for instance, are known to have green sight in their family tree, and the Targs have visions etc. So it could be less about royal blood and more about magical power inherited through the blood? I have tried to look back through the Nights Watch history to see if anyone would have ended up in the Watch at the right time but cant find anyone special that makes sense.

With the world of ASOIAF gaining traction on multiple fronts for new shows, this is personally at the top of my list and one that I think covers the Dance of the Dragons, but from the best possible perspective and through one of the coolest more mysterious characters (death wise) in the entire anthology. Also, you've got ""The Rogue Prince"" to build from already which is an awesome starting point.

It's just called: **Daemon** (or maybe ""The Rogue Prince"")

As a precurser, I'm not likely the first to propose this and probably not the last. I just think this little pocket in time is ideal. Far enough away from GoT that it is it's own thing while also being close enough that there's clear parallels and easter eggs to the show.

John Adams/Band of Brothers style. Just think of all the elements...you have Rhaenyra, House Hightower &amp; Velaryan with a presence (new), Criston Cole as a huge part, Addam V, Nettles, Aegon II, his Stepstones shenanigans, the Dance of the Dragons, Dark Sister, Ceraxes, the list goes on.

Also, the most epic climax towards his end (or maybe not bc his body was never found): The Battle Above the God's Eye. Imagine that on screen.

It would be one thing to follow along all the working parts of the Dance as is always mentioned, but I think his arc actually encapsulates the war in a nice way and does even more from a story wise perspective.

Just wanted to put this out there. Cheers.  ",1,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

The fact theyre bothering to create a whole show about it proves most of those who dismissively quoted lines characters regurgitated from legends we were told were suspect about the history as if it were a closed topic were likely wrong. When the show ends it will likely have a shocker that will lead us to want to understand how the whole story was set up. In this way the shows will be connected.

There probably is more to the concept that the history is a lie. The fact the COTF lied once about making the WW was dismissed as a small lie and they were seen as repentant due to the NK killing one of them and one helping Bran, and the WWs only got out of their control. The cave paintings Jon saw are more propaganda to convince man they are friends. If theyre doing a prequel the age of heroes is more complex and man was likely manipulated more than they know.

I had thought them out a lot and wanted to give them to you all, It is not too in-depth I am only going to go through some of the highlights of my predictions, Also I will only include ONE leak in my predictions, Just ONE and thats it. Now I shall begin.

-	NK attacks Winterfell

-	Longclaw is destroyed by NK, He also kills Ghost right in front of Jon.

-	Jaime dies after defending Bran, dying in Briennes arms.

-	Cersei has a miscarriage

-	Sam finds out the Catspaw Dagger is the only thing that can kill the NK, he also finds out how to forge Valyrian steel.

-	It is revealed nobody is Azor Ahai, the prophecy was wrong and was created by the NK awhile ago as a false tale to bring false hope.

-	 Winterfell burns

-	Giant battle between living and ATOD in the North and Riverlands.

-	Arya slays NK with Catspaw in either Episode 4 or 5, the final conflict is with Cersei. 

-	Euron is taken care of early on in the season by Theon and afterwards him and Yara sail to help Jon and co.
-	Jon and Dany march to KL, Tyrion makes a plan for a small group of people to sneak in and kill Cersei.

-	Qyburn is revealed to be a traitor and is working with Varys. An Angry mob of Citizens kill Cersei (either that or Arya kills Cersei).

-	CLEGANEBOWL, the Hound wins of course.

-	ICE is Reforged (though this happens earlier)

-	All dragons are killed.

-	The throne is melted down and it is decided the people should elect there new ruler, But it will not be a king as a sort of Democratic system is established.

-	Either Tyrion is elected the new ruler of the Seven Kingdoms or Arya and Gendry are made new rulers and get engaged, which ever one is elected rebuild Westeros after the Long Night.

-	Sansa is made Lady of the Vale and Jon and Dany choose to live in the North, With Dany giving birth to a son and surviving child birth (the sons name is Jorah the I Targaryen).

-	The Bittersweet ending is that the world is saved but at a great, great cost as most of the characters like Tormund, Beric, Grey Worm, Missendei, Ghost, Bran, Jorah, Jaime, Pod, Edd, and Yara are killed, and a lot of people died in this war.",21,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I didn't think they would do Age of Heroes I thought they would just do the Original War for the Dawn and that's it, I didn't think they would do the Age of Heroes as well. So yeah I am hyped and I have a lot of faith in Jane Goldman as she did a lot of my favorite films such as Kingsman and Kick-ass.

However this does make me wonder, Will the WW/NK origins still be the third book twist because in the quote about it, it stated we would learn the true origins of the WW's. I have three interpretations for that:

1. The third book twist will NOT be revolved around the WW's and the NK and it will be something else (maybe revolved around Little Sam, or Arya, or Euron, or the Lord of Light, or Dany's true parentage) and we won't learn the true origins of the WW's and NK until the Age of Heroes spin-off.

2. We will learn about the WW and NK's true origins and motives but not the full extent of it, or it wont be the third book twist and it is a origin/motivation just made for the show.

3. NK is not the first WW, for this I would like to bring to youtuber Bridge4, check him out he makes really good content. He believes that the NK we see was NOT the first WW but that WW's existed long before him, and that we will learn that in reality he is the child of Bael the Bard (the bearded NK in the cave Drawings), The Last Hero, The 13th Lord Commander, and the Night's King. the legends of the Night's King were lies and when the Andals arrived the Children found Night's king and turned him into a WW/the new NK. Now there are some holes with that (mainly if the NK we see is suppose to be the Night's king and he was created around the time the Andals showed up, Why is there no snow on the ground when he is being created), But it is still a good theory.

________

&gt;""As you wish,"" said Whitebeard. ""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault. He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.""

&gt; - Daenerys I ASoS

&gt;Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

&gt;""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

&gt;""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""**He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire**."" He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

&gt;On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo's talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. ""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! **The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame**. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."" Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. ""I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger.""

&gt; - Samwell IV AFfC

&gt;In the streets, they call [the Red Comet] the Red Messenger. They say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.

&gt; - Tyrion I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""It is the sword that slays the season,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt;Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. ""Dragons,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be dragons, boy,"" she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

&gt;I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.

&gt; - Melisandre I ADwD

Melisandre is our direct source of information in regards to Azor Ahai and she links the Prince that was Promised to Azor Ahai by using TPtwP and Azor Ahai interchangeably.  Mel talks about how it is written in the ancient books of Asshai that it is prophesied that Azor Ahai shall come again and wield a sword called lightbringer to lead the fight against the Others. Now, there seems to be two ends of the spectrum in regards to people's views about prophecy: on one side is a literalist approach and the other end of the spectrum is that the prophecies are more metaphorical in nature to it having no bearing on the story at all.  I am of the former group because we have already seen that prophecies hold significant bearing. Maggy's prophecy has accurately predicted Cersei's narrative so far as Cersei has married a king and not a prince and had three children as well as Robert having numerous bastards. And in a world of magic where there are greenseers and wargs that are able to see the entire past through the eyes of weirwood trees and animals such as crows and ravens, I do not think that visions in the flames of the followers of Rh'llor are any different.  As for prophecies being metaphorical, I say there *are* aspects of visions being not *completely* literal but I would say that visions are more literal than not, as in that they are more straightfoward than some suggest.  It is for this reason I must say that to be parsimonious in interpretation that prophecies are more literal than they are metaphorical, but they still have an aspect of *being* metaphorical in order to prevent it from being too easy. What GRRM has said reflects this idea:

&gt;Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... 

Melisandre believes it to be Stannis that is TPtwP which is understandable and you will see why. It is Rhaegar's revelation that ties the idea of Azor Ahai/TPtwP into two heads of the three headed dragon.  Rhaegar, from whatever he read, firmly believed that Azor Ahai was three heads of the dragon. And wise old Maester Aemon believed him as well. The reason I suspect that it is only two heads of the three headed dragon is because the third head might not necessarily even be a prince/princess because:

&gt;""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not nessesarily BE a Targaryen...""

&gt; - So Spake Martin, the Citadel

So the third head of the Dragon might not even have a royal title and is not a prince/princess.  Which means Azor Ahai/TPtwP is three heads of the dragon minus one. I'll get to who these two people are later, but as for the third head I strongly suspect it is actually Tyrion and that he is a bastard of Aerys II Targaryen. Despite it having evidence, many people do not like this theory because of personal distaste of the dynamics between Tywin and Tyrion which is fine because I believe that you do not need to accept this theory for the structure of this one to be sustained.  Tyrion could be just a Lannister, but there is much evidence that ties him to the Third Head of the Dragon. Not only does the Red Comet mean dragons but:

&gt;In Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new age

&gt; Theon I ACoK

The three heads of the dragon = A king, a queen (the prince/princess that was promised) and the Hand to bring the new world Daenerys and Tyrion talk about.

Rhaegar strongly points to the fact that Azor Ahai is somehow tied into the Three Heads of the Dragon.  Rhaegar not only thought that the Prince that was Promised was three people, but he also strictly believed that it was only males/princes that fulfilled the prophecy.  Hence why Maester Aemon talks about ""no one ever thought to look for a girl"" and the dragon gender mistranslation, hence Rhaegar stated ""there is one more"" when he thought himself, his baby Aegon, and not his daughter Rhaenys was two of the three heads.

So Maester Aemon thought that Daenerys was the one that was promised.  The reason why he only talks about Daenerys alone is because she is the only living Targaryen, despite Aemon, known to characters in the book. However, we do know that Jon is a legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna. (/u/SchmedStark has a good thread on this that will also be discussed later in this thread [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6wggrg/spoilers_extended_the_books_already_told_us_that/))

Maester Aemon also gives us insight to why Melisandre thought Stannis was the Prince that was Promised.  It is because no one thought to look for a Princess and Stannis is the next choice for TPtwP. Not only do Baratheons have the blood of Targaryens, but Stannis is also rightful heir to the Iron Throne after Robert. Melisandre seems to get caught up in her belief that Stannis is TPtwP that it affects some of her sight seeing. But Mel keeps asking the Lord of Light for visions of Azor Ahai and the Lord keeps showing her Jon Snow, who she does not know is actually a Targaryen.  Many people take Mel as a prime example as a misdirection on GRRM's part, but GRRM tells us indirectly from the start that Stannis isn't actually TPtwP:

&gt;""That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

And then Maester Aemon later confirms this when he marks a quote about lightbringer:

&gt;""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword... Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot...

&gt;Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat ""

&gt;"" would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""**A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold**.""

&gt; - Jon III ADwD

___

Let's take a look at Azor Ahai and how Jon and Daenerys both fit it.

Azor Ahai:

 - Born again amongst salt and smoke

 - Raise dragons from stone

 - Champion of Rh'llor/""Warrior of Fire""

 - Wields lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, to fight the Great Other

Daenerys:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage

 - Born again amongst the funeral pyre

 - Raised dragons from petrified/stone dragon eggs

Jon:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage, ""rightful heir"" of the Iron Throne

 - Resurrected from the dead

 - Is foreshadowed to fight the Others with a burning red sword:

&gt;That night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.

&gt;""Stand fast,"" Jon Snow called. ""Throw them back."" He stood atop the Wall, alone. ""Flame,"" he cried, ""feed them flame,"" but there was no one to pay heed.

&gt;Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. ""Snow,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. 

&gt; - Jon XIII ADwD

 - After reading heavily in his books and reading about prophecies, Rhaegar states ""It seems I must be a warrior"". Rhaegar is now dead, but this could hint at Jon being the warrior he read about, thus is the warrior of fire. The Undying even call Daenerys ""bride of fire"" in the House of Undying in a reference to Jon Snow.

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice (blue flower = Lynna Stark, Jon's mother), and filled the air with sweetness... mother of dragons, **bride of fire**...

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

The reason why I think this Azor Ahai = Prince/Princess duality is perfect is because Jon is the Prince that was promised and will get with Daenerys, the Princess that was promised. That is why Maester Aemon emphasizes the fact that the translation can be one or the other, flickering back and forth like flame, and that dragons are both male and female. The duality also fits the Ice and Fire theme, in that Jon is Ice and Daenerys is fire.  Which is why Mel says in the show:

&gt;Varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King of the North, don't you want to see him again?

&gt;Melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought Ice and Fire together.

However, in the same right which Daenerys claims the Iron Throne actually gives Jon the right (birthright), it is important on Jon's part to marry Daenerys to solidify his claim to the Iron Throne.

###GRRM: on ASoIaF and Lord of the Rings

It is important to see how LotR influenced GRRM and ASoIaF

&gt;**I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.** [link](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/george-r-r-martin-i-revere-the-lord-of-the-rings/)

&gt;**Martin has called J.R.R. Tolkien his great model in shaping the overarching plot of his series.** If you look at Lord of the Rings, it begins with a tight focus and all the characters are together. Then by end of the first book the Fellowship splits up and they have different adventures. I did the same thing. Everybody is at Winterfell in the beginning except for Dany, then they split up into groups, and ultimately those split up too. The intent was to fan out, then curve and come back together. [link](http://time.com/4769331/game-of-thrones-books-george-rr-martin/)

So GRRM has stated that JRR Tolkien (maybe George R Martin chose ""Richard"" as his confirmation name to become George RR Martin in order to mimick JRR Tolkien?) served as a model for the **overarching plot** of the series. GRRM gives the Stark family as an single example, saying that it is modeled after the Fellowship, which were together at the beginning but became split due to a series of events.  You can even see that he modeled Jon after Aragorn:

Jon Snow/Aegon(?*)| Estel/Aragorn| 
:- | -:
Descended from the Targaryen Kings.|Descended from the Kings of Gondor.
Mother is descended from the first King in the North.| Mother was descended from the first chieftain of the Dnedain Aranarth, the rightful King of the Northern Kingdom. 
Takes after his mother in her Stark coloring with grey eyes and dark hair.|Takes after his mother in her Dnedain coloring with grey eyes and dark hair
The Targaryens left Valyria, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the Doom came and much of the peninsula was swallowed by the sea, and kept the last dragons with them, dragons being the signature creatures of Valyria. The dragon would become the sigil of House Targaryen, the kings of Westeros.|The Elendils left Numenor, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the island was swallowed by the sea, and kept what would be the last line of White Trees, a mystical tree from Numenor and the island's signature tree that became the sigil of House Elendil, the kings of Gondor.
Jon leads the Night's Watch in the far North. Those who go north of the wall are called rangers| Aragorn led the rangers of the North.
Just before birth, Jon's father was killed while pursuing rebels. Jon's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Winterfell by Ned. At the bidding of Ned, his lineage was kept secret, as Eddard feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Rhaegar's heir became known. Jon was renamed Jon Snow to hide his existence from Robert Baratheon and his servants| When two years old, his father was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel to hide his existence from Sauron and his servants.

\*The show has already made its mind for Jon's actual name, but the books aren't clear on this.  I think its fitting.  For Aegon was said to forge the Seven Kingdoms with Dragonflame while Jon/Aegon unify, lead, and rebuild the Seven Kingdom that was frozen over and shattered by the Others. As Rhaegar states, ""What better name for a King?"". Plus I wouldn't suspect D&amp;D would deviate from the books on something this big.

Aragorn, in a sense, was the Prince that was Promised of LotR. Aragorn, much like the TPtwP and the Legend of Lightbringer, used Andril: the Flame of the West reforged from the shards of Narsil to fight against Sauron. You will see where I am going with this later. However, as I see this objection to TPtwP being one person and lightbringer being his sword to win against the Great Other, it is important to note that Aragorn isn't the reason why the War of the Ring was won.  Aragorn certainly was a factor in winning the War of the Ring, but he was not the sole reason. Similarly, I do not think Jon nor lightbringer is going to be the sole reason why the living wins the War of the Dawn.

##The Red Comet and Lightbringer: The Sword of Ice becomes Fire


Now this is where I have gotten a lot of flak and ask for temporary suspension of disbelief not because there isn't strong evidence, as you shall see there is *very* strong evidence and I have found some more quotes to support my claim, but because it conflicts with many people's view/interpretation of lightbringer. Again, I take the law of parsimony and state that there is no trickery on GRRM's part and that he intends lightbringer as an actual sword because there is no reason to suggest that it is anything else.

The Red Comet appears not in *A Clash of Kings*, but in *A Game of Thrones* right after Ned Stark's beheading.

&gt;""I  I  I "" Arya sobbed.

&gt;The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. ""Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy."" Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a  a noise  a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. (Ned Stark is beheaded) The old man's fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. ""Look at me. Yes, that's the way of it, at me."" Sour wine perfumed his breath. ""Remember, boy?""...

&gt;""Know me now, do you? There's a bright boy."" He spat. ""They're done here. You'll be coming with me, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. ""Shut, I said.""...

&gt;As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears.

&gt; - Chapter 65 Arya V AGoT

&gt;""For a certainty,"" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.

&gt; - Chapter 66 Bran VII AGoT

Daenerys then takes this as a sign at the end of *A Game of Thrones* to light a pyre to raise her dragons, the same comet which is said to herald the Prince/Princess that was promised, the same comet said to mean of fire and blood, the same comet that is said to mean the coming of dragons, both literal and the three heads. The comet appears *the chapter after* Ned Stark's beheading.  And interestingly enough, there is a description of salty tears from Arya which is often used in the ASoIaF community as evidence for one of the characteristics of AA: born amongst salt and smoke.  Maester Aemon even uses salty tears as evidence for such.

If the Red Comet is a sign of AA coming in this time, then it also follows that the creation of lightbringer is soon to follow.

&gt;""**With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword**, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. **A king should bear a kingly weapon.**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""**It is the sword that slays the season**,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

&gt;""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. **And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him**.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

Here we have three quotes from first chapters of PoV characters at the beginning of ACoK that are all in reference to the Red Comet, which appeared after Ned Stark was beheaded with Ice. It seems obvious that this ties to Ned Stark's Ice being Lightbringer. Ned Stark's Ice is going to become reforged into a sword called Fire, which is fitting considering that the series name is *A Song of Ice and Fire* and has Ned's Ice on the front cover of the first book. Jon snow wielding Ice reforged into Fire reflects the theme.  [There is even a post about how Jon Snow and Ghost are on most of the covers of the first book in different versions of the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/86bsvv/searching_ancient_preshow_bk_1_covers_and_there/)

Not only does these passages seem to imply it, but in the *current* state of Ned Stark's Ice is in two derivative swords from it: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper. In the books, Tywin tried to get Gendry's master Tobho Mott to infuse the two swords with crimson red:

&gt;Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black, as was true here as well. **But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore. ""How did you get this patterning? I've never seen anything like it.""**

&gt;""Nor I, my lord,"" said the armorer. ""I confess, these colors were not what I intended, and I do not know that I could duplicate them. Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House, and it was that color I set out to infuse into the metal. But Valyrian steel is stubborn. These old swords remember, it is said, and they do not change easily. I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again, but always the color would darken, as if the blade was drinking the sun from it. And some folds would not take the red at all, as you can see. If my lords of Lannister are displeased, I will of course try again, as many times as you should require, but""

&gt;""No need,"" Lord Tywin said. ""This will serve.""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

If Ned Stark's greatsword Ice becomes reforged from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail into one sword, then it seems likely that the red coloring in both of the swords can become uniformly red throughout the sword and become the prophesied Red Sword called lightbringer. Interesting how Tobho Mott states ""the steel remembers"" just like the phrase ""the North remembers"" as if to say the ""steel remembers Ned's beheading"". On the Season 7 lore history, Thoros of Myr narrates a segment on the Lord of Light, Azor Ahai, and lightbringer and his wording is interesting:

&gt;According to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and **reforge the great sword** Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with the lifeblood of a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much, at least, the Lord of Light is clear on.[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjs)

""Reforge the great sword"".  Greatsword, like Ned Stark's Ice?  Many say that this is a silly idea because it is a huge sword, but its description makes it seem like the size of a regular greatsword (~5 ft, wide as the width of a hand) and greatswords were commonly used in war.  And if greatswords can be used in war, then a Valyrian Steel greatsword is lighter than regular steel greatsword and most certainly can be used in battle much like when Ned used it at the breach of the Pyke during the Greyjoy rebellion.

The Legend of Lightbringer

&gt;""...I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

Ned Stark's Ice was melted down and worked into two swords and tempered in water.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

This is going to involve Cersei's death.  Now, Cersei's death was said by Maggy:

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

So people take this as Cersei being choked to death. However, the valonqar's hands wrapping around her throat, I believe, signifies her becoming a captured lion.  And there has been plenty of foreshadowing of Arya being the one to kill Cersei.

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

Cersei spends her entire time being paranoid that Tyrion will be the one to kill her. GRRM on prophecies:

&gt;[Laughs] Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? Thats the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

I think Tyrion is going to plot with Arya Cersei's assassination in order to prevent further conflict from happening.  Arya knows how to get into the Red Keep, she found out about the tunnels while training by capturing cats.  Tyrion knows where it leads to, so he will be able to help Arya kill Cersei.  I think Arya is going to use Jaime's face, as Arya is, indeed, left-handed and can play the role of Jaime, and there is a refrain that keeps popping up in the series:

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**...""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The hands of gold refers to Tyrion, as the chain of the Hand of the King is golden interlocked hands and Tyrion's person sigil is a golden hand surrounded by gold lions on a crimson field, but I think it is a double entendre on GRRM's part to say that ""Tyrion nor Jaime (who has a golden hand) are the valonqar, but a woman is"". Arya being Jaime would mean she would have Widow's Wail (if the show is to be believed that Jaime would get it).  The show further emphasizes this idea with Ed Sheeran singing Symon silver tongue's song up to the refrain where all the Lannister men sing: 

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm. For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" (They stop and look at Arya).

The scene concludes with Arya saying:

&gt;""I'm going to kill the queen"" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9OoIQUTPaQ)

Arya having the catspaw dagger in the show could be fitting as Arya will become Tyrion's catspaw. Then capturing a lion is much like Arya's training to capture cats.  Even the Hound taught Arya where to find the heart to kill a person.

&gt;Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?""

&gt;She nodded. ""Tomorrow we're going to catch cats.""

&gt; - Eddard VII AGoT

&gt;Catching cats was hard...

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of Cats**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat* (Rains of Castamere refers to Lannister lion = cat)

&gt; - Arya VII ASoS

&gt;The queen watched his face, wary as a cat.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;Cersei hissed like an angry cat

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;She slapped him. Jaime's arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick . . . but this cat had a cripple's stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek.

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;Cersei summoned Jocelyn to brush her hair out whilst she slipped off her shoes and stretched like a cat.

&gt; - Cersei IV AFfC

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

And Arya has a chapter in TWoW where she pays a character named ""Mercy"" in a play about Tyrion called the ""Bloody Hand"".  The show takes a twist on this chapter.  Arya is sent on a redemption mission to kill the actor who plays Cersei Lannister.  Arya advises the actor to rework her speech about Joffrey dying, stating that a mother who watched her firstborn die would be more angry (likey reflecting on Catelyn watching Robb die infront of her).  The actor asks for Arya's name and Arya says ""Mercy"". [link](https://youtu.be/mJE87JlWZig?t=79)

The reason why it is more appealing for Arya to kill Cersei is because the undoing of the Stark family was at the hands of the Lannisters, and Cersei played a huge role in it. Arya is one of two characters that experienced the beheading of Ned as a well as the Red Wedding.

 Ned Stark stated that it was the madness of mercy that made him confront Cersei. [link to the scene](https://youtu.be/Q-GSOHCVPfA?t=80). Ned didn't want Robert to go on a rage and murder Cersei's children, as the books reveal that the murder of Elia Martell's children really had a toll on Ned and Ned didn't want Robert to go Tywin on Cersei's kids, but Ned also felt that he couldn't keep the truth of Cersei's children secret from Robert so he confronted Cersei about it in *hopes* that she would flee Westeros for her children. If you look at the valonqar prophecy about her children and Arya killing Cersei in an act of mercy, it parallels Ned's mercy to Cersei.  The valonqar prophecy states that Cersei's children will die ""gold will be the crowns.  Gold their shrouds"" and then it moves to the idea of Cersei going mad with her grief to the valonqar killing her (Arya giving her the gift of mercy) ""when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you"".[You can read more about Arya delivering Ned's justice in my post ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7jpr67/spoilers_main_arya_is_neds_gift_of_mercy/).

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?""

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""The madness of mercy,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV AGoT

&gt;Corruption! There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge (the Red Comet)! We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon... There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!

&gt; - Tyrion V ACoK

&gt;Catelyn: The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it's an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue. I wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.

&gt;Brynden: That thing's not crimson. Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That's blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.

&gt; - Catelyn I ACoK

The fact that Arya will be part of the second forging of lightbringer is reflected in her first two paragraphs of her first chapter:

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

And her naming her sword ""Needle"" after her stitch-work is symbolic that she is going to be part of the ""stitching together"" of Oathkeeper and Widow's wail. I actually believe that Gendry will be the one to reforge Ned Stark's Ice, as his master was the one who worked the greatsword into two separate blades and he was the one to call the Red Comet ""red sword"".  And, in a chapter that is full of symbolism, Catelyn was praying and says this of the smith:

&gt;Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. **She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken**.

&gt; - Catelyn IV ACoK

Daenerys becoming a wight/Other (which is for another post).

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

But I do have a strong feeling that Ned Stark's Ice will become reforged into Fire because of all of the evidence that is presented.  The reforging of the Stark ancestral sword that was used to cut off Ned's head, which caused the family to further split up, is a symbolic of the Starks coming back together.  Much like the splitting of the sword into two Lannister swords is symbolic of the Stark family being scattered by the doing of Lannisters.  [The scene with Tywin where Oathkeeper and WW was made reflects this as Ice was sheathed in a Greywind's pelt and after the splitting of the swords Tywin throws the direwolf's pelt into the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcr_mj3VTTQ).  What better weapon for a Targaryen king than a greatsword named Fire? Fire reforged from Ice for the son of Ice and Fire.

I think the lover ""Nissa Nissa"" implies two read-throughs of the legend of Lightbringer. The second read-through was presented first here for argument's sake and because the second-read through tells us *how* lightbringer is made. The first read-through tells us which sword is lightbringer by Joffrey's swords and is tied together with rubies. Rubies are gems that luster like fire. What better way to point to Lightbringer than with gems that have a fire to them? The fire to rubies is why Targaryen kings chose the gem for their crowns and armor, and why followers of Rh'llor, like Mel, wear the gem. 

Joffrey's first sword, Lion's Tooth, thrown into the Ruby Ford by Arya.

Joffrey's second sword, hearteater, had a heart shaped ruby in the jaws of a lion for the pommel and was presented at the battle of blackwater where Tyrion was almost stabbed in the heart:

&gt;""I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."" **Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart**. ""Who else was lost?""

&gt; - Tyrion I ASoS

And the show reveals that it is Joffrey that commanded Ser Mandon Moore.  So Tyrion plotting Arya assassinating Cersei reflects the fact that these two people are the people Joffrey tried killing in the first read through of the Legend of Lightbringer.

The third instance, King Joffrey gets Widow's Wail, one of two swords derived from Ned Stark's Ice and has rubies in the eyes of a lion on the crossguard, much like its sister sword Oathkeeper does.

The first read-through points to Ned Stark's Ice being lightbringer, while the second read through tells us *how* it becomes lightbringer. 

So here I have presented my argument on why:

 - Azor Ahai is not only real but is tied to TPtwP and the Three Heads of the Dragon.

 - Azor Ahai is duality, two of the three heads of the dragon

 - Lightbringer is very likely Ned Stark's sword reforged.

I am here to open minds to my ideas and discuss, I hope you enjoyed what I presented.  There are some obvious objections that I haven't addressed because I do not have much more space to do so.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

________

&gt;""As you wish,"" said Whitebeard. ""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault. He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.""

&gt; - Daenerys I ASoS

&gt;Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

&gt;""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

&gt;""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""**He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire**."" He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

&gt;On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo's talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. ""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! **The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame**. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."" Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. ""I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger.""

&gt; - Samwell IV AFfC

&gt;In the streets, they call [the Red Comet] the Red Messenger. They say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.

&gt; - Tyrion I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""It is the sword that slays the season,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt;Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. ""Dragons,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be dragons, boy,"" she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

&gt;I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.

&gt; - Melisandre I ADwD

Melisandre is our direct source of information in regards to Azor Ahai and she links the Prince that was Promised to Azor Ahai by using TPtwP and Azor Ahai interchangeably.  Mel talks about how it is written in the ancient books of Asshai that it is prophesied that Azor Ahai shall come again and wield a sword called lightbringer to lead the fight against the Others. Now, there seems to be two ends of the spectrum in regards to people's views about prophecy: on one side is a literalist approach and the other end of the spectrum is that the prophecies are more metaphorical in nature to it having no bearing on the story at all.  I am of the former group because we have already seen that prophecies hold significant bearing. Maggy's prophecy has accurately predicted Cersei's narrative so far as Cersei has married a king and not a prince and had three children as well as Robert having numerous bastards. And in a world of magic where there are greenseers and wargs that are able to see the entire past through the eyes of weirwood trees and animals such as crows and ravens, I do not think that visions in the flames of the followers of Rh'llor are any different.  As for prophecies being metaphorical, I say there *are* aspects of visions being not *completely* literal but I would say that visions are more literal than not, as in that they are more straightfoward than some suggest.  It is for this reason I must say that to be parsimonious in interpretation that prophecies are more literal than they are metaphorical, but they still have an aspect of *being* metaphorical in order to prevent it from being too easy. What GRRM has said reflects this idea:

&gt;Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... 

Melisandre believes it to be Stannis that is TPtwP which is understandable and you will see why. It is Rhaegar's revelation that ties the idea of Azor Ahai/TPtwP into two heads of the three headed dragon.  Rhaegar, from whatever he read, firmly believed that Azor Ahai was three heads of the dragon. And wise old Maester Aemon believed him as well. The reason I suspect that it is only two heads of the three headed dragon is because the third head might not necessarily even be a prince/princess because:

&gt;""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not nessesarily BE a Targaryen...""

&gt; - So Spake Martin, the Citadel

So the third head of the Dragon might not even have a royal title and is not a prince/princess.  Which means Azor Ahai/TPtwP is three heads of the dragon minus one. I'll get to who these two people are later, but as for the third head I strongly suspect it is actually Tyrion and that he is a bastard of Aerys II Targaryen. Despite it having evidence, many people do not like this theory but I stand firm in saying it is true. Not only does the Red Comet mean dragons but:

&gt;In Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new age

&gt; Theon I ACoK

The three heads of the dragon means the New World that Daenerys wants to build.

Rhaegar strongly points to the fact that Azor Ahai is somehow tied into the Three Heads of the Dragon.  Rhaegar not only thought that the Prince that was Promised was three people, but he also strictly believed that it was only males/princes that fulfilled the prophecy.  Hence why Maester Aemon talks about ""no one ever thought to look for a girl"" and the dragon gender mistranslation, hence Rhaegar stated ""there is one more"" when he thought himself, his baby Aegon, and not his daughter Rhaenys was two of the three heads.

So Maester Aemon thought that Daenerys was the one that was promised.  The reason why he only talks about Daenerys alone is because she is the only living Targaryen, despite Aemon, known to characters in the book. However, we do know that Jon is a legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna.

Maester Aemon also gives us insight to why Melisandre thought Stannis was the Prince that was Promised.  It is because no one thought to look for a Princess and Stannis is the next choice for TPtwP. Not only do Baratheons have the blood of Targaryens, but Stannis is also rightful heir to the Iron Throne after Robert. Melisandre seems to get caught up in her belief that Stannis is TPtwP that it affects some of her sight seeing. But Mel keeps asking the Lord of Light for visions of Azor Ahai and the Lord keeps showing her Jon Snow, who she does not know is actually a Targaryen.  Many people take Mel as a prime example as a misdirection on GRRM's part, but GRRM tells us indirectly from the start that Stannis isn't actually TPtwP:

&gt;""That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

And then Maester Aemon later confirms this when he marks a quote about lightbringer:

&gt;""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword... Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot...

&gt;Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat ""

&gt;"" would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""**A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold**.""

&gt; - Jon III ADwD

___

Let's take a look at Azor Ahai and how Jon and Daenerys both fit it.

Azor Ahai:

 - Born again amongst salt and smoke

 - Raise dragons from stone

 - Champion of Rh'llor/""Warrior of Fire""

 - Wields lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, to fight the Great Other

Daenerys:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage

 - Born again amongst the funeral pyre

 - Raised dragons from petrified/stone dragon eggs

Jon:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage, ""rightful heir"" of the Iron Throne

 - Resurrected from the dead (or Lyanna birthing him also fits).

 - Is foreshadowed to fight the Others with the burning red sword called Lightbringer:

&gt;That night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.

&gt;""Stand fast,"" Jon Snow called. ""Throw them back."" He stood atop the Wall, alone. ""Flame,"" he cried, ""feed them flame,"" but there was no one to pay heed.

&gt;Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. ""Snow,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. 

&gt; - Jon XIII ADwD

 - After reading heavily in his books and reading about prophecies, Rhaegar states ""It seems I must be a warrior"". Rhaegar is now dead, but this could hint at Jon being the warrior he read about, thus is the warrior of fire. The Undying even call Daenerys ""bride of fire"" in the House of Undying in a reference to Jon Snow.

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice (blue flower = Lynna Stark, Jon's mother), and filled the air with sweetness... mother of dragons, **bride of fire**...

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

The reason why I think this Azor Ahai = Prince/Princess duality is perfect is because Jon is the Prince that was promised and will get with Daenerys, the Princess that was promised. That is why Maester Aemon emphasizes the fact that the translation can be one or the other, flickering back and forth like flame, and that dragons are both male and female. The duality also fits the Ice and Fire theme, in that Jon is Ice and Daenerys is fire.  Which is why Mel says in the show:

&gt;Varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King of the North, don't you want to see him again?

&gt;Melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought Ice and Fire together.

However, in the same right which Daenerys claims the Iron Throne actually gives Jon the right (birthright), it is important on Jon's part to marry Daenerys to solidify his claim to the Iron Throne.

Ice is to marry Fire.

###GRRM: on ASoIaF and Lord of the Rings

It is important to see how LotR influenced GRRM and ASoIaF

&gt;**I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.**

&gt;**Martin has called J.R.R. Tolkien his great model in shaping the overarching plot of his series.** If you look at Lord of the Rings, it begins with a tight focus and all the characters are together. Then by end of the first book the Fellowship splits up and they have different adventures. I did the same thing. Everybody is at Winterfell in the beginning except for Dany, then they split up into groups, and ultimately those split up too. The intent was to fan out, then curve and come back together.

So GRRM has stated that JRR Tolkien (maybe George R Martin chose ""Richard"" as his confirmation name to become George RR Martin in order to mimick JRR Tolkien?) served as a model for the **overarching plot** of the series. GRRM gives the Stark family as an single example, saying that it is modeled after the Fellowship, which were together at the beginning but became split due to a series of events.  You can even see that he modeled Jon after Aragorn:

Jon Snow/Aegon(?*)| Estel/Aragorn| 
:- | -:
Descended from the Targaryen Kings.|Descended from the Kings of Gondor.
Mother is descended from the first King in the North.| Mother was descended from the first chieftain of the Dnedain Aranarth, the rightful King of the Northern Kingdom. 
Takes after his mother in her Stark coloring with grey eyes and dark hair.|Takes after his mother in her Dnedain coloring with grey eyes and dark hair
The Targaryens left Valyria, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the Doom came and much of the peninsula was swallowed by the sea, and kept the last dragons with them, dragons being the signature creatures of Valyria. The dragon would become the sigil of House Targaryen, the kings of Westeros.|The Elendils left Numenor, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the island was swallowed by the sea, and kept what would be the last line of White Trees, a mystical tree from Numenor and the island's signature tree that became the sigil of House Elendil, the kings of Gondor.
Jon leads the Night's Watch in the far North. Those who go north of the wall are called rangers| Aragorn led the rangers of the North.
Just before birth, Jon's father was killed while pursuing rebels. Jon's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Winterfell by Ned. At the bidding of Ned, his lineage was kept secret, as Eddard feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Rhaegar's heir became known. Jon was renamed Jon Snow to hide his existence from Robert Baratheon and his servants| When two years old, his father was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel to hide his existence from Sauron and his servants.

\*The show has already made its mind for Jon's actual name, but the books aren't clear on this.  I think its fitting.  For Aegon was said to forge the Seven Kingdoms with Dragonflame while Jon/Aegon unify, lead, and rebuild the Seven Kingdom that was frozen over and shattered by the Others. As Rhaegar states, ""What better name for a King?"". Plus I wouldn't suspect D&amp;D would deviate from the books on something this big.

Aragorn, in a sense, was the Prince that was Promised of LotR. Aragorn, much like the TPtwP and the Legend of Lightbringer, used Andril: the Flame of the West reforged from the shards of Narsil to fight against Sauron. You will see where I am going with this later. However, as I see this objection to TPtwP being one person and lightbringer being his sword to win against the Great Other, it is important to note that Aragorn isn't the reason why the War of the Ring was won.  Aragorn certainly was a factor in winning the War of the Ring, but he was not the sole reason. Similarly, I do not think Jon nor lightbringer is going to be the sole reason why the living wins the War of the Dawn.

##The Red Comet and Lightbringer: The Sword of Ice becomes Fire


Now this is where I have gotten a lot of flak and ask for temporary suspension of disbelief not because there isn't strong evidence, as you shall see there is *very* strong evidence and I have found some more quotes to support my claim, but because it conflicts with many people's view/interpretation of lightbringer. Again, I take the law of parsimony and state that there is no trickery on GRRM's part and that he intends lightbringer as an actual sword because there is no reason to suggest that it is anything else.

The Red Comet appears not in *A Clash of Kings*, but in *A Game of Thrones* right after Ned Stark's beheading WITH his greatsword Ice.

&gt;""I  I  I "" Arya sobbed.

&gt;The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. ""Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy."" Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a  a noise  a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. (Ned Stark is beheaded) The old man's fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. ""Look at me. Yes, that's the way of it, at me."" Sour wine perfumed his breath. ""Remember, boy?""...

&gt;""Know me now, do you? There's a bright boy."" He spat. ""They're done here. You'll be coming with me, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. ""Shut, I said.""...

&gt;As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears.

&gt; - Chapter 65 Arya V AGoT

&gt;""For a certainty,"" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.

&gt; - Chapter 66 Bran VII AGoT

Daenerys then takes this as a sign at the end of *A Game of Thrones* to light a pyre to raise her dragons, the same comet which is said to herald the Prince/Princess that was promised, the same comet said to mean of fire and blood, the same comet that is said to mean the coming of dragons, both literal and the three heads. The comet appears *the chapter after* Ned Stark's beheading with Ice.

If the Red Comet is a sign of AA coming in this time, then it also follows that the creation of lightbringer is soon to follow.

&gt;""**With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword**, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. **A king should bear a kingly weapon.**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. **And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him**.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""**It is the sword that slays the season**,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

Here we have three quotes from first chapters of PoV characters at the beginning of ACoK that are all in reference to the Red Comet, which appeared after Ned Stark was beheaded with Ice. It seems obvious that this ties to Ned Stark's Ice being Lightbringer. Ned Stark's Ice is going to become reforged into a sword called Fire, which is fitting considering that the series name is *A Song of Ice and Fire* and has Ned's Ice on the front cover of the first book. Jon snow wielding Ice reforged into Fire reflects the theme.  [There is even a post about how Jon Snow and Ghost are on most of the covers of the first book in different versions of the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/86bsvv/searching_ancient_preshow_bk_1_covers_and_there/)

Not only does these passages seem to imply it, but in the *current* state of Ned Stark's Ice is in two derivative swords from it: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper. In the books, Tywin tried to get Gendry's master Tobho Mott to infuse the two swords with crimson red:

&gt;Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black, as was true here as well. **But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore. ""How did you get this patterning? I've never seen anything like it.""**

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The red is infused like a bloody wave on a black steely shore and the two colors didn't touch.

If Ned Stark's greatsword Ice becomes reforged from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail into one sword, then it seems likely that the red coloring in both of the swords can become uniformly red throughout the sword and become the prophesied Red Sword called lightbringer. On the Season 7 lore history, Thoros of Myr narrates a segment on the Lord of Light, Azor Ahai, and lightbringer and his wording is interesting:

&gt;According to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and **reforge the great sword** Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with the lifeblood of a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much, at least, the Lord of Light is clear on.[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjs)

""Reforge the great sword"".  Greatsword, like Ned Stark's Ice?  Many say that this is a silly idea because it is a huge sword, but its description makes it seem like the size of a regular greatsword (~5 ft, wide as the width of a hand) and greatswords were commonly used in war.  And if greatswords can be used in war, then a Valyrian Steel greatsword is lighter than regular steel greatsword and most certainly can be used in battle much like when Ned used it at the breach of the Pyke during the Greyjoy rebellion.

But I strongly suspect that the Army of the Dead will be lured into King's Landing and that they will blow up King's Landing.  However, the Night King will still be alive with wight Viserion and so they reforged Ice into one sword to be used against a dragon.

The Legend of Lightbringer

&gt;""...I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

Ned Stark's Ice was melted down and worked into two swords and tempered in water.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

This is going to involve Cersei's death.  Now, Cersei's death was said by Maggy:

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

So people take this as Cersei being choked to death. However, the valonqar's hands wrapping around her throat, I believe, signifies her becoming a captured lion.  And there has been plenty of foreshadowing of Arya being the one to kill Cersei.

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

Cersei spends her entire time being paranoid that Tyrion will be the one to kill her. However, Arya knows OF Maegor's tunnels but Tyrion knows *how* to navigate them to get where Arya can kill Cersei.  So I think Arya will use Jaime's face as Tyrion's catspaw to kill Cersei. GRRM on prophecies:

&gt;[Laughs] Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? Thats the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

Arya found out about the tunnels while training by capturing cats.  Tyrion knows where it leads to, so he will be able to help Arya kill Cersei.  I think Arya is going to use Jaime's face, as Arya is, indeed, left-handed and can play the role of Jaime, and there is a refrain that keeps popping up in the series that /r/asoiaf took as ""Jaime's hands will strangle Cersei"", but it goes:

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**...""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The hands of gold refers to Tyrion, as the chain of the Hand of the King is golden interlocked hands and Tyrion's person sigil is a golden hand surrounded by gold lions on a crimson field, but I think it is a double entendre on GRRM's part to say that ""Both of Cersei's brothers, Tyrion nor Jaime (who has a golden hand) is the valonqar, but a woman is"". Arya being Jaime would mean she would have Widow's Wail, one of the two swords that came from Ned's Ice.  The show further emphasizes this idea with Ed Sheeran singing Symon silver tongue's song up to the refrain where all the Lannister men sing: 

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm. For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" (They stop and look at Arya).

The scene concludes with Arya saying:

&gt;""I'm going to kill the queen"" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9OoIQUTPaQ)

Then capturing a lion is much like Arya's training to capture cats.  Even the Hound taught Arya where to find the heart to kill a person.

&gt;Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?""

&gt;She nodded. ""Tomorrow we're going to catch cats.""

&gt; - Eddard VII AGoT

&gt;Catching cats was hard...

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of Cats**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat* (Rains of Castamere refers to Lannister lion = cat)

&gt; - Arya VII ASoS

&gt;The queen watched his face, wary as a cat.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;Cersei hissed like an angry cat

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;She slapped him. Jaime's arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick . . . but this cat had a cripple's stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek.

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;Cersei summoned Jocelyn to brush her hair out whilst she slipped off her shoes and stretched like a cat.

&gt; - Cersei IV AFfC

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

And Arya has a chapter in TWoW where she pays a character named ""Mercy"" in a play about Tyrion called the ""Bloody Hand"".  The show takes a twist on this chapter.  Arya is sent on a redemption mission to kill the actor who plays Cersei Lannister.  Arya advises the actor to rework her speech about Joffrey dying, stating that a mother who watched her firstborn die would be more angry (likey reflecting on Catelyn watching Robb die infront of her).  The actor asks for Arya's name and Arya says ""Mercy"". [link](https://youtu.be/mJE87JlWZig?t=79)

The reason why it is more appealing for Arya to kill Cersei is because the undoing of the Stark family was at the hands of the Lannisters, and Cersei played a huge role in it. Arya is one of two characters that experienced the beheading of Ned as a well as the Red Wedding.

The father of the faith of the seven is sought out for Divine Justice, and his description perfectly fits Ned. The people who set up Ned to be imprisoned and then beheaded are: Janos - beheaded by Jon Snow, Littlefinger - killed by Arya at Sansa's sentencing, Cersei - killed by Arya.  So you can see where the idea of divine justice comes into play.

Ned Stark stated that it was the madness of mercy that made him confront Cersei. [link to the scene](https://youtu.be/Q-GSOHCVPfA?t=80). Ned didn't want Robert to go on a rage and murder Cersei's children, as the books reveal that the murder of Elia Martell's children really had a toll on Ned and Ned didn't want Robert to go Tywin on Cersei's kids, but Ned also felt that he couldn't keep the truth of Cersei's children secret from Robert so he confronted Cersei about it in *hopes* that she would flee Westeros for her children. If you look at the valonqar prophecy about her children and Arya killing Cersei in an act of mercy, it parallels Ned's mercy to Cersei.  The valonqar prophecy states that Cersei's children will die ""gold will be the crowns.  Gold their shrouds"" and then it moves to the idea of Cersei going mad with her grief to the valonqar killing her (Arya giving her the gift of mercy) ""when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you"". You can read more about Arya delivering Ned's justice in my post ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy"". (I am unable to post it links to other subreddits, but it'll pop up if you google it.)

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?""

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""The madness of mercy,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV AGoT

&gt;Corruption! There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge (the Red Comet)! We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon... There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!

&gt; - Tyrion V ACoK

&gt;Catelyn: The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it's an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue. I wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.

&gt;Brynden: That thing's not crimson. Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That's blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.

&gt; - Catelyn I ACoK

The fact that Arya will be part of the second forging of lightbringer is reflected in her first two paragraphs of her first chapter:

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

And her naming her sword ""Needle"" after her stitch-work is symbolic that she is going to be part of the ""stitching together"" of Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail  and the restoration of the Stark family much like Narsil reforged into Andril was the restoration of the line of the Kings of Gondor.

I actually believe that Gendry will be the one to reforge Ned Stark's Ice, as his master was the one who worked the greatsword into two separate blades and he was the one to call the Red Comet ""red sword"".  And, in a chapter that is full of symbolism, Catelyn was praying and says this of the smith:

&gt;Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. **She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken**.

&gt; - Catelyn IV ACoK

The next instant of forging lightbringer:

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

Daenerys becoming a wight/Other.

I do have a strong feeling that Ned Stark's Ice will become reforged into Fire because of all of the evidence that is presented.  The reforging of the Stark ancestral sword that was used to cut off Ned's head, which caused the family to further split up, is a symbolic of the Starks coming back together.  Much like the splitting of the sword into two Lannister swords is symbolic of the Stark family being scattered by the doing of Lannisters.  [The scene with Tywin where Oathkeeper and WW was made reflects this as Ice was sheathed in a Greywind's pelt and after the splitting of the swords Tywin throws the direwolf's pelt into the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcr_mj3VTTQ).

I am convinced Ice is lightbringer. I am confident I have provided a framework for understanding TPtWP/AA/LB/THD prophecy and I must present it to the community for further discussion to happen and to reveal the literary genius that is GRRM.

&gt;""As you wish,"" said Whitebeard. ""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault. He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.""

&gt; - Daenerys I ASoS

&gt;Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

&gt;""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

&gt;""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""**He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire**."" He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

&gt;On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo's talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. ""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! **The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame**. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."" Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. ""I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger.""

&gt; - Samwell IV AFfC

&gt;In the streets, they call [the Red Comet] the Red Messenger. They say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""It is the sword that slays the season,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt;Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. ""Dragons,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be dragons, boy,"" she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

&gt;I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.

&gt; - Melisandre I ADwD

Melisandre is our direct source of information in regards to Azor Ahai and she links the Prince that was Promised to Azor Ahai by using TPtwP and Azor Ahai interchangeably.  Mel talks about how it is written in the ancient books of Asshai that it is prophesied that Azor Ahai shall come again and wield a sword called lightbringer to lead the fight against the Others. Now, there seems to be two ends of the spectrum in regards to people's views about prophecy: on one side is a literalist approach and the other end of the spectrum is that the prophecies are more metaphorical in nature to it having no bearing on the story at all.  I am of the former group because we have already seen that prophecies hold significant bearing. Maggy's prophecy has accurately predicted Cersei's narrative so far as Cersei has married a king and not a prince and had three children as well as Robert having numerous bastards. And in a world of magic where there are greenseers and wargs that are able to see the entire past through the eyes of weirwood trees and animals such as crows and ravens, I do not think that visions in the flames of the followers of Rh'llor are any different.  As for prophecies being metaphorical, I say there *are* aspects of visions being not *completely* literal but I would say that visions are more literal than not, as in that they are more straightfoward than some suggest.  It is for this reason I must say that to be parsimonious in interpretation that prophecies are more literal than they are metaphorical, but they still have an aspect of *being* metaphorical in order to prevent it from being too easy. What GRRM has said reflects this idea:

&gt;Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... 

Melisandre believes it to be Stannis that is TPtwP which is understandable and you will see why. It is Rhaegar's revelation that ties the idea of Azor Ahai/TPtwP into two heads of the three headed dragon.  Rhaegar, from whatever he read, firmly believed that Azor Ahai was three heads of the dragon. And wise old Maester Aemon believed him as well. The reason I suspect that it is only two heads of the three headed dragon is because the third head might not necessarily even be a prince/princess because:

&gt;""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not nessesarily BE a Targaryen...""

&gt; - So Spake Martin, the Citadel

So the third head of the Dragon might not even have a royal title and is not a prince/princess.  Which means Azor Ahai/TPtwP is three heads of the dragon minus one. I'll get to who these two people are later, but as for the third head I strongly suspect it is actually Tyrion and that he is a bastard of Aerys II Targaryen. Despite it having evidence, many people do not like this theory but I stand firm in saying it is true. Not only does the Red Comet mean dragons but:

&gt;In Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new age

&gt; Theon I ACoK

The three heads of the dragon means the New World that Daenerys wants to build.

Rhaegar strongly points to the fact that Azor Ahai is somehow tied into the Three Heads of the Dragon.  Rhaegar not only thought that the Prince that was Promised was three people, but he also strictly believed that it was only males/princes that fulfilled the prophecy.  Hence why Maester Aemon talks about ""no one ever thought to look for a girl"" and the dragon gender mistranslation, hence Rhaegar stated ""there is one more"" when he thought himself, his baby Aegon, and not his daughter Rhaenys was two of the three heads.

So Maester Aemon thought that Daenerys was the one that was promised.  The reason why he only talks about Daenerys alone is because she is the only living Targaryen, despite Aemon, known to characters in the book. However, we do know that Jon is a legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna.

Maester Aemon also gives us insight to why Melisandre thought Stannis was the Prince that was Promised.  It is because no one thought to look for a Princess and Stannis is the next choice for TPtwP. Not only do Baratheons have the blood of Targaryens, but Stannis is also rightful heir to the Iron Throne after Robert. Melisandre seems to get caught up in her belief that Stannis is TPtwP that it affects some of her sight seeing. But Mel keeps asking the Lord of Light for visions of Azor Ahai and the Lord keeps showing her Jon Snow, who she does not know is actually a Targaryen.  Many people take Mel as a prime example as a misdirection on GRRM's part, but GRRM tells us indirectly from the start that Stannis isn't actually TPtwP:

&gt;""That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

And then Maester Aemon later confirms this when he marks a quote about lightbringer:

&gt;""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword... Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot...

&gt;Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat ""

&gt;"" would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""**A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold**.""

&gt; - Jon III ADwD

___

Let's take a look at Azor Ahai and how Jon and Daenerys both fit it.

Azor Ahai:

 - Born again amongst salt and smoke

 - Raise dragons from stone

 - Champion of Rh'llor/""Warrior of Fire""

 - Wields lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, to fight the Great Other

Daenerys:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage

 - Born again amongst the funeral pyre

 - Raised dragons from petrified/stone dragon eggs

Jon:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage, ""rightful heir"" of the Iron Throne

 - Resurrected from the dead (or Lyanna birthing him also fits).

 - Is foreshadowed to fight the Others with the burning red sword called Lightbringer:

&gt;That night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.

&gt;""Stand fast,"" Jon Snow called. ""Throw them back."" He stood atop the Wall, alone. ""Flame,"" he cried, ""feed them flame,"" but there was no one to pay heed.

&gt;Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. ""Snow,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. 

&gt; - Jon XIII ADwD

 - After reading heavily in his books and reading about prophecies, Rhaegar states ""It seems I must be a warrior"". Rhaegar is now dead, but this could hint at Jon being the warrior he read about, thus is the warrior of fire. The Undying even call Daenerys ""bride of fire"" in the House of Undying in a reference to Jon Snow.

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice (blue flower = Lynna Stark, Jon's mother), and filled the air with sweetness... mother of dragons, **bride of fire**...

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

The reason why I think this Azor Ahai = Prince/Princess duality is perfect is because Jon is the Prince that was promised and will get with Daenerys, the Princess that was promised. That is why Maester Aemon emphasizes the fact that the translation can be one or the other, flickering back and forth like flame, and that dragons are both male and female. The duality also fits the Ice and Fire theme, in that Jon is Ice and Daenerys is fire.  Which is why Mel says in the show:

&gt;Varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King of the North, don't you want to see him again?

&gt;Melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought Ice and Fire together.

However, in the same right which Daenerys claims the Iron Throne actually gives Jon the right (birthright), it is important on Jon's part to marry Daenerys to solidify his claim to the Iron Throne.

Ice is to marry Fire.

###GRRM: on ASoIaF and Lord of the Rings

It is important to see how LotR influenced GRRM and ASoIaF

&gt;**I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.**

&gt;**Martin has called J.R.R. Tolkien his great model in shaping the overarching plot of his series.** If you look at Lord of the Rings, it begins with a tight focus and all the characters are together. Then by end of the first book the Fellowship splits up and they have different adventures. I did the same thing. Everybody is at Winterfell in the beginning except for Dany, then they split up into groups, and ultimately those split up too. The intent was to fan out, then curve and come back together.

So GRRM has stated that JRR Tolkien (maybe George R Martin chose ""Richard"" as his confirmation name to become George RR Martin in order to mimick JRR Tolkien?) served as a model for the **overarching plot** of the series. GRRM gives the Stark family as an single example, saying that it is modeled after the Fellowship, which were together at the beginning but became split due to a series of events.  You can even see that he modeled Jon after Aragorn:

Jon Snow/Aegon(?*)| Estel/Aragorn| 
:- | -:
Descended from the Targaryen Kings.|Descended from the Kings of Gondor.
Mother is descended from the first King in the North.| Mother was descended from the first chieftain of the Dnedain Aranarth, the rightful King of the Northern Kingdom. 
Takes after his mother in her Stark coloring with grey eyes and dark hair.|Takes after his mother in her Dnedain coloring with grey eyes and dark hair
The Targaryens left Valyria, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the Doom came and much of the peninsula was swallowed by the sea, and kept the last dragons with them, dragons being the signature creatures of Valyria. The dragon would become the sigil of House Targaryen, the kings of Westeros.|The Elendils left Numenor, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the island was swallowed by the sea, and kept what would be the last line of White Trees, a mystical tree from Numenor and the island's signature tree that became the sigil of House Elendil, the kings of Gondor.
Jon leads the Night's Watch in the far North. Those who go north of the wall are called rangers| Aragorn led the rangers of the North.
Just before birth, Jon's father was killed while pursuing rebels. Jon's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Winterfell by Ned. At the bidding of Ned, his lineage was kept secret, as Eddard feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Rhaegar's heir became known. Jon was renamed Jon Snow to hide his existence from Robert Baratheon and his servants| When two years old, his father was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel to hide his existence from Sauron and his servants.

\*The show has already made its mind for Jon's actual name, but the books aren't clear on this.  I think its fitting.  For Aegon was said to forge the Seven Kingdoms with Dragonflame while Jon/Aegon unify, lead, and rebuild the Seven Kingdom that was frozen over and shattered by the Others. As Rhaegar states, ""What better name for a King?"". Plus I wouldn't suspect D&amp;D would deviate from the books on something this big.

Aragorn, in a sense, was the Prince that was Promised of LotR. Aragorn, much like the TPtwP and the Legend of Lightbringer, used Andril: the Flame of the West reforged from the shards of Narsil to fight against Sauron. You will see where I am going with this later. However, as I see this objection to TPtwP being one person and lightbringer being his sword to win against the Great Other, it is important to note that Aragorn isn't the reason why the War of the Ring was won.  Aragorn certainly was a factor in winning the War of the Ring, but he was not the sole reason. Similarly, I do not think Jon nor lightbringer is going to be the sole reason why the living wins the War of the Dawn.

##The Red Comet and Lightbringer: The Sword of Ice becomes Fire


Now this is where I have gotten a lot of flak and ask for temporary suspension of disbelief not because there isn't strong evidence, as you shall see there is *very* strong evidence and I have found some more quotes to support my claim, but because it conflicts with many people's view/interpretation of lightbringer. Again, I take the law of parsimony and state that there is no trickery on GRRM's part and that he intends lightbringer as an actual sword because there is no reason to suggest that it is anything else.

The Red Comet appears not in *A Clash of Kings*, but in *A Game of Thrones* right after Ned Stark's beheading WITH his greatsword Ice.

&gt;""I  I  I "" Arya sobbed.

&gt;The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. ""Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy."" Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a  a noise  a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. (Ned Stark is beheaded) The old man's fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. ""Look at me. Yes, that's the way of it, at me."" Sour wine perfumed his breath. ""Remember, boy?""...

&gt;""Know me now, do you? There's a bright boy."" He spat. ""They're done here. You'll be coming with me, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. ""Shut, I said.""...

&gt;As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears.

&gt; - Chapter 65 Arya V AGoT

&gt;""For a certainty,"" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.

&gt; - Chapter 66 Bran VII AGoT

Daenerys then takes this as a sign at the end of *A Game of Thrones* to light a pyre to raise her dragons, the same comet which is said to herald the Prince/Princess that was promised, the same comet said to mean of fire and blood, the same comet that is said to mean the coming of dragons, both literal and the three heads. The comet appears *the chapter after* Ned Stark's beheading with Ice.

If the Red Comet is a sign of AA coming in this time, then it also follows that the creation of lightbringer is soon to follow.

&gt;""**With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword**, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. **A king should bear a kingly weapon.**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. **And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him**.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""**It is the sword that slays the season**,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

Here we have three quotes from first chapters of PoV characters at the beginning of ACoK that are all in reference to the Red Comet, which appeared after Ned Stark was beheaded with Ice. It seems obvious that this ties to Ned Stark's Ice being Lightbringer. Ned Stark's Ice is going to become reforged into a sword called Fire, which is fitting considering that the series name is *A Song of Ice and Fire* and has Ned's Ice on the front cover of the first book. Jon snow wielding Ice reforged into Fire reflects the theme.  [There is even a post about how Jon Snow and Ghost are on most of the covers of the first book in different versions of the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/86bsvv/searching_ancient_preshow_bk_1_covers_and_there/)

Not only does these passages seem to imply it, but in the *current* state of Ned Stark's Ice is in two derivative swords from it: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper. In the books, Tywin tried to get Gendry's master Tobho Mott to infuse the two swords with crimson red:

&gt;Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black, as was true here as well. **But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore. ""How did you get this patterning? I've never seen anything like it.""**

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The red is infused like a bloody wave on a black steely shore and the two colors didn't touch.

If Ned Stark's greatsword Ice becomes reforged from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail into one sword, then it seems likely that the red coloring in both of the swords can become uniformly red throughout the sword and become the prophesied Red Sword called lightbringer. On the Season 7 lore history, Thoros of Myr narrates a segment on the Lord of Light, Azor Ahai, and lightbringer and his wording is interesting:

&gt;According to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and **reforge the great sword** Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with the lifeblood of a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much, at least, the Lord of Light is clear on.[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjs)

""Reforge the great sword"".  Greatsword, like Ned Stark's Ice?  Many say that this is a silly idea because it is a huge sword, but its description makes it seem like the size of a regular greatsword (~5 ft, wide as the width of a hand) and greatswords were commonly used in war.  And if greatswords can be used in war, then a Valyrian Steel greatsword is lighter than regular steel greatsword and most certainly can be used in battle much like when Ned used it at the breach of the Pyke during the Greyjoy rebellion.

But I strongly suspect that the Army of the Dead will be lured into King's Landing and that they will blow up King's Landing.  However, the Night King will still be alive with wight Viserion and so they reforged Ice into one sword to be used against a dragon.

The Legend of Lightbringer

&gt;""...I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

Ned Stark's Ice was melted down and worked into two swords and tempered in water.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

This is going to involve Cersei's death.  Now, Cersei's death was said by Maggy:

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

So people take this as Cersei being choked to death. However, the valonqar's hands wrapping around her throat, I believe, signifies her becoming a captured lion.  And there has been plenty of foreshadowing of Arya being the one to kill Cersei.

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

Cersei spends her entire time being paranoid that Tyrion will be the one to kill her. However, Arya knows OF Maegor's tunnels but Tyrion knows *how* to navigate them to get where Arya can kill Cersei.  So I think Arya will use Jaime's face as Tyrion's catspaw to kill Cersei. GRRM on prophecies:

&gt;[Laughs] Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? Thats the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

Arya found out about the tunnels while training by capturing cats.  Tyrion knows where it leads to, so he will be able to help Arya kill Cersei.  I think Arya is going to use Jaime's face, as Arya is, indeed, left-handed and can play the role of Jaime, and there is a refrain that keeps popping up in the series that /r/asoiaf took as ""Jaime's hands will strangle Cersei"", but it goes:

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**...""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The hands of gold refers to Tyrion, as the chain of the Hand of the King is golden interlocked hands and Tyrion's person sigil is a golden hand surrounded by gold lions on a crimson field, but I think it is a double entendre on GRRM's part to say that ""Both of Cersei's brothers, Tyrion nor Jaime (who has a golden hand) is the valonqar, but a woman is"". Arya being Jaime would mean she would have Widow's Wail, one of the two swords that came from Ned's Ice.  The show further emphasizes this idea with Ed Sheeran singing Symon silver tongue's song up to the refrain where all the Lannister men sing: 

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm. For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" (They stop and look at Arya).

The scene concludes with Arya saying:

&gt;""I'm going to kill the queen"" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9OoIQUTPaQ)

Then capturing a lion is much like Arya's training to capture cats.  Even the Hound taught Arya where to find the heart to kill a person.

&gt;Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?""

&gt;She nodded. ""Tomorrow we're going to catch cats.""

&gt; - Eddard VII AGoT

&gt;Catching cats was hard...

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of Cats**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat* (Rains of Castamere refers to Lannister lion = cat)

&gt; - Arya VII ASoS

&gt;The queen watched his face, wary as a cat.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;Cersei hissed like an angry cat

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;She slapped him. Jaime's arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick . . . but this cat had a cripple's stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek.


&gt; - Cersei I AFfC
&gt;Cersei summoned Jocelyn to brush her hair out whilst she slipped off her shoes and stretched like a cat.

&gt; - Cersei IV AFfC

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

And Arya has a chapter in TWoW where she pays a character named ""Mercy"" in a play about Tyrion called the ""Bloody Hand"".  The show takes a twist on this chapter.  Arya is sent on a redemption mission to kill the actor who plays Cersei Lannister.  Arya advises the actor to rework her speech about Joffrey dying, stating that a mother who watched her firstborn die would be more angry (likey reflecting on Catelyn watching Robb die infront of her).  The actor asks for Arya's name and Arya says ""Mercy"". [link](https://youtu.be/mJE87JlWZig?t=79)

The reason why it is more appealing for Arya to kill Cersei is because the undoing of the Stark family was at the hands of the Lannisters, and Cersei played a huge role in it. Arya is one of two characters that experienced the beheading of Ned as a well as the Red Wedding.

The father of the faith of the seven is sought out for Divine Justice, and his description perfectly fits Ned. The people who set up Ned to be imprisoned and then beheaded are: Janos - beheaded by Jon Snow, Littlefinger - killed by Arya at Sansa's sentencing, Cersei - killed by Arya.  So you can see where the idea of divine justice comes into play.

Ned Stark stated that it was the madness of mercy that made him confront Cersei. [link to the scene](https://youtu.be/Q-GSOHCVPfA?t=80). Ned didn't want Robert to go on a rage and murder Cersei's children, as the books reveal that the murder of Elia Martell's children really had a toll on Ned and Ned didn't want Robert to go Tywin on Cersei's kids, but Ned also felt that he couldn't keep the truth of Cersei's children secret from Robert so he confronted Cersei about it in *hopes* that she would flee Westeros for her children. If you look at the valonqar prophecy about her children and Arya killing Cersei in an act of mercy, it parallels Ned's mercy to Cersei.  The valonqar prophecy states that Cersei's children will die ""gold will be the crowns.  Gold their shrouds"" and then it moves to the idea of Cersei going mad with her grief to the valonqar killing her (Arya giving her the gift of mercy) ""when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you"". You can read more about Arya delivering Ned's justice in my post ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy"". (I am unable to post it links to other subreddits, but it'll pop up if you google it.)

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?""

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""The madness of mercy,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV AGoT

&gt;Corruption! There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge (the Red Comet)! We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon... There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!

&gt; - Tyrion V ACoK

&gt;Catelyn: The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it's an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue. I wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.

&gt;Brynden: That thing's not crimson. Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That's blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.

&gt; - Catelyn I ACoK

The fact that Arya will be part of the second forging of lightbringer is reflected in her first two paragraphs of her first chapter:

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

And her naming her sword ""Needle"" after her stitch-work is symbolic that she is going to be part of the ""stitching together"" of Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail  and the restoration of the Stark family much like Narsil reforged into Andril was the restoration of the line of the Kings of Gondor.

I actually believe that Gendry will be the one to reforge Ned Stark's Ice, as his master was the one who worked the greatsword into two separate blades and he was the one to call the Red Comet ""red sword"".  And, in a chapter that is full of symbolism, Catelyn was praying and says this of the smith:

&gt;Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. **She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken**.

&gt; - Catelyn IV ACoK

The next instant of forging lightbringer:

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

Daenerys becoming a wight/Other.

I do have a strong feeling that Ned Stark's Ice will become reforged into Fire because of all of the evidence that is presented.  The reforging of the Stark ancestral sword that was used to cut off Ned's head, which caused the family to further split up, is a symbolic of the Starks coming back together.  Much like the splitting of the sword into two Lannister swords is symbolic of the Stark family being scattered by the doing of Lannisters.  [The scene with Tywin where Oathkeeper and WW was made reflects this as Ice was sheathed in a Greywind's pelt and after the splitting of the swords Tywin throws the direwolf's pelt into the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcr_mj3VTTQ).

I am convinced Ice is lightbringer. I am confident I have provided a framework for understanding TPtWP/AA/LB/THD prophecy and I must present it to the community for further discussion to happen and to reveal the literary genius that is GRRM.

&gt;""As you wish,"" said Whitebeard. ""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault. He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.""

&gt; - Daenerys I ASoS

&gt;Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

&gt;""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

&gt;""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""**He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire**."" He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

&gt;On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo's talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. ""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! **The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame**. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."" Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. ""I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger.""

&gt; - Samwell IV AFfC

&gt;In the streets, they call [the Red Comet] the Red Messenger. They say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.

&gt; - Tyrion I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""It is the sword that slays the season,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt;Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. ""Dragons,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be dragons, boy,"" she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

&gt;I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.

&gt; - Melisandre I ADwD

Melisandre is our direct source of information in regards to Azor Ahai and she links the Prince that was Promised to Azor Ahai by using TPtwP and Azor Ahai interchangeably.  Mel talks about how it is written in the ancient books of Asshai that it is prophesied that Azor Ahai shall come again and wield a sword called lightbringer to lead the fight against the Others. Now, there seems to be two ends of the spectrum in regards to people's views about prophecy: on one side is a literalist approach and the other end of the spectrum is that the prophecies are more metaphorical in nature to it having no bearing on the story at all.  I am of the former group because we have already seen that prophecies hold significant bearing. Maggy's prophecy has accurately predicted Cersei's narrative so far as Cersei has married a king and not a prince and had three children as well as Robert having numerous bastards. And in a world of magic where there are greenseers and wargs that are able to see the entire past through the eyes of weirwood trees and animals such as crows and ravens, I do not think that visions in the flames of the followers of Rh'llor are any different.  As for prophecies being metaphorical, I say there *are* aspects of visions being not *completely* literal but I would say that visions are more literal than not, as in that they are more straightfoward than some suggest.  It is for this reason I must say that to be parsimonious in interpretation that prophecies are more literal than they are metaphorical, but they still have an aspect of *being* metaphorical in order to prevent it from being too easy. What GRRM has said reflects this idea:

&gt;Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... 

Melisandre believes it to be Stannis that is TPtwP which is understandable and you will see why. It is Rhaegar's revelation that ties the idea of Azor Ahai/TPtwP into two heads of the three headed dragon.  Rhaegar, from whatever he read, firmly believed that Azor Ahai was three heads of the dragon. And wise old Maester Aemon believed him as well. The reason I suspect that it is only two heads of the three headed dragon is because the third head might not necessarily even be a prince/princess because:

&gt;""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not nessesarily BE a Targaryen...""

&gt; - So Spake Martin, the Citadel

So the third head of the Dragon might not even have a royal title and is not a prince/princess.  Which means Azor Ahai/TPtwP is three heads of the dragon minus one. I'll get to who these two people are later, but as for the third head I strongly suspect it is actually Tyrion and that he is a bastard of Aerys II Targaryen. Despite it having evidence, many people do not like this theory but I stand firm in saying it is true. Not only does the Red Comet mean dragons but:

&gt;In Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new age

&gt; Theon I ACoK

The three heads of the dragon means the New World that Daenerys wants to build.

Rhaegar strongly points to the fact that Azor Ahai is somehow tied into the Three Heads of the Dragon.  Rhaegar not only thought that the Prince that was Promised was three people, but he also strictly believed that it was only males/princes that fulfilled the prophecy.  Hence why Maester Aemon talks about ""no one ever thought to look for a girl"" and the dragon gender mistranslation, hence Rhaegar stated ""there is one more"" when he thought himself, his baby Aegon, and not his daughter Rhaenys was two of the three heads.

So Maester Aemon thought that Daenerys was the one that was promised.  The reason why he only talks about Daenerys alone is because she is the only living Targaryen, despite Aemon, known to characters in the book. However, we do know that Jon is a legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna.

Maester Aemon also gives us insight to why Melisandre thought Stannis was the Prince that was Promised.  It is because no one thought to look for a Princess and Stannis is the next choice for TPtwP. Not only do Baratheons have the blood of Targaryens, but Stannis is also rightful heir to the Iron Throne after Robert. Melisandre seems to get caught up in her belief that Stannis is TPtwP that it affects some of her sight seeing. But Mel keeps asking the Lord of Light for visions of Azor Ahai and the Lord keeps showing her Jon Snow, who she does not know is actually a Targaryen.  Many people take Mel as a prime example as a misdirection on GRRM's part, but GRRM tells us indirectly from the start that Stannis isn't actually TPtwP:

&gt;""That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

And then Maester Aemon later confirms this when he marks a quote about lightbringer:

&gt;""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword... Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot...

&gt;Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat ""

&gt;"" would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""**A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold**.""

&gt; - Jon III ADwD

___

Let's take a look at Azor Ahai and how Jon and Daenerys both fit it.

Azor Ahai:

 - Born again amongst salt and smoke

 - Raise dragons from stone

 - Champion of Rh'llor/""Warrior of Fire""

 - Wields lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, to fight the Great Other

Daenerys:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage

 - Born again amongst the funeral pyre

 - Raised dragons from petrified/stone dragon eggs

Jon:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage, ""rightful heir"" of the Iron Throne

 - Resurrected from the dead (or Lyanna birthing him also fits).

 - Is foreshadowed to fight the Others with the burning red sword called Lightbringer:

&gt;That night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.

&gt;""Stand fast,"" Jon Snow called. ""Throw them back."" He stood atop the Wall, alone. ""Flame,"" he cried, ""feed them flame,"" but there was no one to pay heed.

&gt;Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. ""Snow,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. 

&gt; - Jon XIII ADwD

 - After reading heavily in his books and reading about prophecies, Rhaegar states ""It seems I must be a warrior"". Rhaegar is now dead, but this could hint at Jon being the warrior he read about, thus is the warrior of fire. The Undying even call Daenerys ""bride of fire"" in the House of Undying in a reference to Jon Snow.

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice (blue flower = Lynna Stark, Jon's mother), and filled the air with sweetness... mother of dragons, **bride of fire**...

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

The reason why I think this Azor Ahai = Prince/Princess duality is perfect is because Jon is the Prince that was promised and will get with Daenerys, the Princess that was promised. That is why Maester Aemon emphasizes the fact that the translation can be one or the other, flickering back and forth like flame, and that dragons are both male and female. The duality also fits the Ice and Fire theme, in that Jon is Ice and Daenerys is fire.  Which is why Mel says in the show:

&gt;Varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King of the North, don't you want to see him again?

&gt;Melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought Ice and Fire together.

However, in the same right which Daenerys claims the Iron Throne actually gives Jon the right (birthright), it is important on Jon's part to marry Daenerys to solidify his claim to the Iron Throne.

Ice is to marry Fire.

###GRRM: on ASoIaF and Lord of the Rings

It is important to see how LotR influenced GRRM and ASoIaF

&gt;**I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.**

&gt;**Martin has called J.R.R. Tolkien his great model in shaping the overarching plot of his series.** If you look at Lord of the Rings, it begins with a tight focus and all the characters are together. Then by end of the first book the Fellowship splits up and they have different adventures. I did the same thing. Everybody is at Winterfell in the beginning except for Dany, then they split up into groups, and ultimately those split up too. The intent was to fan out, then curve and come back together.

So GRRM has stated that JRR Tolkien (maybe George R Martin chose ""Richard"" as his confirmation name to become George RR Martin in order to mimick JRR Tolkien?) served as a model for the **overarching plot** of the series. GRRM gives the Stark family as an single example, saying that it is modeled after the Fellowship, which were together at the beginning but became split due to a series of events.  You can even see that he modeled Jon after Aragorn:

Jon Snow/Aegon(?*)| Estel/Aragorn| 
:- | -:
Descended from the Targaryen Kings.|Descended from the Kings of Gondor.
Mother is descended from the first King in the North.| Mother was descended from the first chieftain of the Dnedain Aranarth, the rightful King of the Northern Kingdom. 
Takes after his mother in her Stark coloring with grey eyes and dark hair.|Takes after his mother in her Dnedain coloring with grey eyes and dark hair
The Targaryens left Valyria, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the Doom came and much of the peninsula was swallowed by the sea, and kept the last dragons with them, dragons being the signature creatures of Valyria. The dragon would become the sigil of House Targaryen, the kings of Westeros.|The Elendils left Numenor, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the island was swallowed by the sea, and kept what would be the last line of White Trees, a mystical tree from Numenor and the island's signature tree that became the sigil of House Elendil, the kings of Gondor.
Jon leads the Night's Watch in the far North. Those who go north of the wall are called rangers| Aragorn led the rangers of the North.
Just before birth, Jon's father was killed while pursuing rebels. Jon's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Winterfell by Ned. At the bidding of Ned, his lineage was kept secret, as Eddard feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Rhaegar's heir became known. Jon was renamed Jon Snow to hide his existence from Robert Baratheon and his servants| When two years old, his father was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel to hide his existence from Sauron and his servants.

\*The show has already made its mind for Jon's actual name, but the books aren't clear on this.  I think its fitting.  For Aegon was said to forge the Seven Kingdoms with Dragonflame while Jon/Aegon unify, lead, and rebuild the Seven Kingdom that was frozen over and shattered by the Others. As Rhaegar states, ""What better name for a King?"". Plus I wouldn't suspect D&amp;D would deviate from the books on something this big.

Aragorn, in a sense, was the Prince that was Promised of LotR. Aragorn, much like the TPtwP and the Legend of Lightbringer, used Andril: the Flame of the West reforged from the shards of Narsil to fight against Sauron. You will see where I am going with this later. However, as I see this objection to TPtwP being one person and lightbringer being his sword to win against the Great Other, it is important to note that Aragorn isn't the reason why the War of the Ring was won.  Aragorn certainly was a factor in winning the War of the Ring, but he was not the sole reason. Similarly, I do not think Jon nor lightbringer is going to be the sole reason why the living wins the War of the Dawn.

##The Red Comet and Lightbringer: The Sword of Ice becomes Fire


Now this is where I have gotten a lot of flak and ask for temporary suspension of disbelief not because there isn't strong evidence, as you shall see there is *very* strong evidence and I have found some more quotes to support my claim, but because it conflicts with many people's view/interpretation of lightbringer. Again, I take the law of parsimony and state that there is no trickery on GRRM's part and that he intends lightbringer as an actual sword because there is no reason to suggest that it is anything else.

The Red Comet appears not in *A Clash of Kings*, but in *A Game of Thrones* right after Ned Stark's beheading WITH his greatsword Ice.

&gt;""I  I  I "" Arya sobbed.

&gt;The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. ""Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy."" Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a  a noise  a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. (Ned Stark is beheaded) The old man's fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. ""Look at me. Yes, that's the way of it, at me."" Sour wine perfumed his breath. ""Remember, boy?""...

&gt;""Know me now, do you? There's a bright boy."" He spat. ""They're done here. You'll be coming with me, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. ""Shut, I said.""...

&gt;As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears.

&gt; - Chapter 65 Arya V AGoT

&gt;""For a certainty,"" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.

&gt; - Chapter 66 Bran VII AGoT

Daenerys then takes this as a sign at the end of *A Game of Thrones* to light a pyre to raise her dragons, the same comet which is said to herald the Prince/Princess that was promised, the same comet said to mean of fire and blood, the same comet that is said to mean the coming of dragons, both literal and the three heads. The comet appears *the chapter after* Ned Stark's beheading with Ice.

If the Red Comet is a sign of AA coming in this time, then it also follows that the creation of lightbringer is soon to follow.

&gt;""**With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword**, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. **A king should bear a kingly weapon.**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. **And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him**.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""**It is the sword that slays the season**,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

Here we have three quotes from first chapters of PoV characters at the beginning of ACoK that are all in reference to the Red Comet, which appeared after Ned Stark was beheaded with Ice. It seems obvious that this ties to Ned Stark's Ice being Lightbringer. Ned Stark's Ice is going to become reforged into a sword called Fire, which is fitting considering that the series name is *A Song of Ice and Fire* and has Ned's Ice on the front cover of the first book. Jon snow wielding Ice reforged into Fire reflects the theme.  [There is even a post about how Jon Snow and Ghost are on most of the covers of the first book in different versions of the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/86bsvv/searching_ancient_preshow_bk_1_covers_and_there/)

Not only does these passages seem to imply it, but in the *current* state of Ned Stark's Ice is in two derivative swords from it: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper. In the books, Tywin tried to get Gendry's master Tobho Mott to infuse the two swords with crimson red:

&gt;Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black, as was true here as well. **But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore. ""How did you get this patterning? I've never seen anything like it.""**

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The red is infused like a bloody wave on a black steely shore and the two colors didn't touch.

If Ned Stark's greatsword Ice becomes reforged from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail into one sword, then it seems likely that the red coloring in both of the swords can become uniformly red throughout the sword and become the prophesied Red Sword called lightbringer. On the Season 7 lore history, Thoros of Myr narrates a segment on the Lord of Light, Azor Ahai, and lightbringer and his wording is interesting:

&gt;According to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and **reforge the great sword** Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with the lifeblood of a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much, at least, the Lord of Light is clear on.[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjs)

""Reforge the great sword"".  Greatsword, like Ned Stark's Ice?  Many say that this is a silly idea because it is a huge sword, but its description makes it seem like the size of a regular greatsword (~5 ft, wide as the width of a hand) and greatswords were commonly used in war.  And if greatswords can be used in war, then a Valyrian Steel greatsword is lighter than regular steel greatsword and most certainly can be used in battle much like when Ned used it at the breach of the Pyke during the Greyjoy rebellion.

But I strongly suspect that the Army of the Dead will be lured into King's Landing and that they will blow up King's Landing.  However, the Night King will still be alive with wight Viserion and so they reforged Ice into one sword to be used against a dragon.

The Legend of Lightbringer

&gt;""...I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

Ned Stark's Ice was melted down and worked into two swords and tempered in water.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

This is going to involve Cersei's death.  Now, Cersei's death was said by Maggy:

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

So people take this as Cersei being choked to death. However, the valonqar's hands wrapping around her throat, I believe, signifies her becoming a captured lion.  And there has been plenty of foreshadowing of Arya being the one to kill Cersei.

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

Cersei spends her entire time being paranoid that Tyrion will be the one to kill her. However, Arya knows OF Maegor's tunnels but Tyrion knows *how* to navigate them to get where Arya can kill Cersei.  So I think Arya will use Jaime's face as Tyrion's catspaw to kill Cersei. GRRM on prophecies:

&gt;[Laughs] Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? Thats the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

Arya found out about the tunnels while training by capturing cats.  Tyrion knows where it leads to, so he will be able to help Arya kill Cersei.  I think Arya is going to use Jaime's face, as Arya is, indeed, left-handed and can play the role of Jaime, and there is a refrain that keeps popping up in the series that /r/asoiaf took as ""Jaime's hands will strangle Cersei"", but it goes:

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**...""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The hands of gold refers to Tyrion, as the chain of the Hand of the King is golden interlocked hands and Tyrion's person sigil is a golden hand surrounded by gold lions on a crimson field, but I think it is a double entendre on GRRM's part to say that ""Both of Cersei's brothers, Tyrion nor Jaime (who has a golden hand) is the valonqar, but a woman is"". Arya being Jaime would mean she would have Widow's Wail, one of the two swords that came from Ned's Ice.  The show further emphasizes this idea with Ed Sheeran singing Symon silver tongue's song up to the refrain where all the Lannister men sing: 

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm. For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" (They stop and look at Arya).

The scene concludes with Arya saying:

&gt;""I'm going to kill the queen"" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9OoIQUTPaQ)

Then capturing a lion is much like Arya's training to capture cats.  Even the Hound taught Arya where to find the heart to kill a person.

&gt;Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?""

&gt;She nodded. ""Tomorrow we're going to catch cats.""

&gt; - Eddard VII AGoT

&gt;Catching cats was hard...

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of Cats**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat* (Rains of Castamere refers to Lannister lion = cat)

&gt; - Arya VII ASoS

&gt;The queen watched his face, wary as a cat.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;Cersei hissed like an angry cat

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;She slapped him. Jaime's arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick . . . but this cat had a cripple's stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek.


&gt; - Cersei I AFfC
&gt;Cersei summoned Jocelyn to brush her hair out whilst she slipped off her shoes and stretched like a cat.

&gt; - Cersei IV AFfC

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

And Arya has a chapter in TWoW where she pays a character named ""Mercy"" in a play about Tyrion called the ""Bloody Hand"".  The show takes a twist on this chapter.  Arya is sent on a redemption mission to kill the actor who plays Cersei Lannister.  Arya advises the actor to rework her speech about Joffrey dying, stating that a mother who watched her firstborn die would be more angry (likey reflecting on Catelyn watching Robb die infront of her).  The actor asks for Arya's name and Arya says ""Mercy"". [link](https://youtu.be/mJE87JlWZig?t=79)

The reason why it is more appealing for Arya to kill Cersei is because the undoing of the Stark family was at the hands of the Lannisters, and Cersei played a huge role in it. Arya is one of two characters that experienced the beheading of Ned as a well as the Red Wedding.

The father of the faith of the seven is sought out for Divine Justice, and his description perfectly fits Ned. The people who set up Ned to be imprisoned and then beheaded are: Janos - beheaded by Jon Snow, Littlefinger - killed by Arya at Sansa's sentencing, Cersei - killed by Arya.  So you can see where the idea of divine justice comes into play.

Ned Stark stated that it was the madness of mercy that made him confront Cersei. [link to the scene](https://youtu.be/Q-GSOHCVPfA?t=80). Ned didn't want Robert to go on a rage and murder Cersei's children, as the books reveal that the murder of Elia Martell's children really had a toll on Ned and Ned didn't want Robert to go Tywin on Cersei's kids, but Ned also felt that he couldn't keep the truth of Cersei's children secret from Robert so he confronted Cersei about it in *hopes* that she would flee Westeros for her children. If you look at the valonqar prophecy about her children and Arya killing Cersei in an act of mercy, it parallels Ned's mercy to Cersei.  The valonqar prophecy states that Cersei's children will die ""gold will be the crowns.  Gold their shrouds"" and then it moves to the idea of Cersei going mad with her grief to the valonqar killing her (Arya giving her the gift of mercy) ""when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you"". You can read more about Arya delivering Ned's justice in my post ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy"". (I am unable to post it links to other subreddits, but it'll pop up if you google it.)

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?""

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""The madness of mercy,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV AGoT

&gt;Corruption! There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge (the Red Comet)! We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon... There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!

&gt; - Tyrion V ACoK

&gt;Catelyn: The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it's an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue. I wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.

&gt;Brynden: That thing's not crimson. Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That's blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.

&gt; - Catelyn I ACoK

The fact that Arya will be part of the second forging of lightbringer is reflected in her first two paragraphs of her first chapter:

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

And her naming her sword ""Needle"" after her stitch-work is symbolic that she is going to be part of the ""stitching together"" of Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail  and the restoration of the Stark family much like Narsil reforged into Andril was the restoration of the line of the Kings of Gondor.

I actually believe that Gendry will be the one to reforge Ned Stark's Ice, as his master was the one who worked the greatsword into two separate blades and he was the one to call the Red Comet ""red sword"".  And, in a chapter that is full of symbolism, Catelyn was praying and says this of the smith:

&gt;Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. **She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken**.

&gt; - Catelyn IV ACoK

The next instant of forging lightbringer:

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

Daenerys becoming a wight/Other.

I do have a strong feeling that Ned Stark's Ice will become reforged into Fire because of all of the evidence that is presented.  The reforging of the Stark ancestral sword that was used to cut off Ned's head, which caused the family to further split up, is a symbolic of the Starks coming back together.  Much like the splitting of the sword into two Lannister swords is symbolic of the Stark family being scattered by the doing of Lannisters.  [The scene with Tywin where Oathkeeper and WW was made reflects this as Ice was sheathed in a Greywind's pelt and after the splitting of the swords Tywin throws the direwolf's pelt into the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcr_mj3VTTQ).

I am convinced Ice is lightbringer. I am confident I have provided a framework for understanding TPtWP/AA/LB/THD prophecy and I must present it to the community for further discussion to happen and to reveal the literary genius that is GRRM. 

________

&gt;""As you wish,"" said Whitebeard. ""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault. He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.""

&gt; - Daenerys I ASoS

&gt;Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

&gt;""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

&gt;""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""**He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire**."" He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

&gt;On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo's talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. ""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! **The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame**. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."" Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. ""I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger.""

&gt; - Samwell IV AFfC

&gt;In the streets, they call [the Red Comet] the Red Messenger. They say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.

&gt; - Tyrion I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""It is the sword that slays the season,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt;Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. ""Dragons,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be dragons, boy,"" she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

&gt;I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.

&gt; - Melisandre I ADwD

Melisandre is our direct source of information in regards to Azor Ahai and she links the Prince that was Promised to Azor Ahai by using TPtwP and Azor Ahai interchangeably.  Mel talks about how it is written in the ancient books of Asshai that it is prophesied that Azor Ahai shall come again and wield a sword called lightbringer to lead the fight against the Others. Now, there seems to be two ends of the spectrum in regards to people's views about prophecy: on one side is a literalist approach and the other end of the spectrum is that the prophecies are more metaphorical in nature to it having no bearing on the story at all.  I am of the former group because we have already seen that prophecies hold significant bearing. Maggy's prophecy has accurately predicted Cersei's narrative so far as Cersei has married a king and not a prince and had three children as well as Robert having numerous bastards. And in a world of magic where there are greenseers and wargs that are able to see the entire past through the eyes of weirwood trees and animals such as crows and ravens, I do not think that visions in the flames of the followers of Rh'llor are any different.  As for prophecies being metaphorical, I say there *are* aspects of visions being not *completely* literal but I would say that visions are more literal than not, as in that they are more straightfoward than some suggest.  It is for this reason I must say that to be parsimonious in interpretation that prophecies are more literal than they are metaphorical, but they still have an aspect of *being* metaphorical in order to prevent it from being too easy. What GRRM has said reflects this idea:

&gt;Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... 

Melisandre believes it to be Stannis that is TPtwP which is understandable and you will see why. It is Rhaegar's revelation that ties the idea of Azor Ahai/TPtwP into two heads of the three headed dragon.  Rhaegar, from whatever he read, firmly believed that Azor Ahai was three heads of the dragon. And wise old Maester Aemon believed him as well. The reason I suspect that it is only two heads of the three headed dragon is because the third head might not necessarily even be a prince/princess because:

&gt;""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not nessesarily BE a Targaryen...""

&gt; - So Spake Martin, the Citadel

So the third head of the Dragon might not even have a royal title and is not a prince/princess.  Which means Azor Ahai/TPtwP is three heads of the dragon minus one. I'll get to who these two people are later, but as for the third head I strongly suspect it is actually Tyrion and that he is a bastard of Aerys II Targaryen. Despite it having evidence, many people do not like this theory but I stand firm in saying it is true. Not only does the Red Comet mean dragons but:

&gt;In Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new age

&gt; Theon I ACoK

The three heads of the dragon means the New World that Daenerys wants to build.

Rhaegar strongly points to the fact that Azor Ahai is somehow tied into the Three Heads of the Dragon.  Rhaegar not only thought that the Prince that was Promised was three people, but he also strictly believed that it was only males/princes that fulfilled the prophecy.  Hence why Maester Aemon talks about ""no one ever thought to look for a girl"" and the dragon gender mistranslation, hence Rhaegar stated ""there is one more"" when he thought himself, his baby Aegon, and not his daughter Rhaenys was two of the three heads.

So Maester Aemon thought that Daenerys was the one that was promised.  The reason why he only talks about Daenerys alone is because she is the only living Targaryen, despite Aemon, known to characters in the book. However, we do know that Jon is a legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna.

Maester Aemon also gives us insight to why Melisandre thought Stannis was the Prince that was Promised.  It is because no one thought to look for a Princess and Stannis is the next choice for TPtwP. Not only do Baratheons have the blood of Targaryens, but Stannis is also rightful heir to the Iron Throne after Robert. Melisandre seems to get caught up in her belief that Stannis is TPtwP that it affects some of her sight seeing. But Mel keeps asking the Lord of Light for visions of Azor Ahai and the Lord keeps showing her Jon Snow, who she does not know is actually a Targaryen.  Many people take Mel as a prime example as a misdirection on GRRM's part, but GRRM tells us indirectly from the start that Stannis isn't actually TPtwP:

&gt;""That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

And then Maester Aemon later confirms this when he marks a quote about lightbringer:

&gt;""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword... Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot...

&gt;Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat ""

&gt;"" would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""**A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold**.""

&gt; - Jon III ADwD

___

Let's take a look at Azor Ahai and how Jon and Daenerys both fit it.

Azor Ahai:

 - Born again amongst salt and smoke

 - Raise dragons from stone

 - Champion of Rh'llor/""Warrior of Fire""

 - Wields lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, to fight the Great Other

Daenerys:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage

 - Born again amongst the funeral pyre

 - Raised dragons from petrified/stone dragon eggs

Jon:

 - Is of Targaryen lineage, ""rightful heir"" of the Iron Throne

 - Resurrected from the dead (or Lyanna birthing him also fits).

 - Is foreshadowed to fight the Others with the burning red sword called Lightbringer:

&gt;That night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.

&gt;""Stand fast,"" Jon Snow called. ""Throw them back."" He stood atop the Wall, alone. ""Flame,"" he cried, ""feed them flame,"" but there was no one to pay heed.

&gt;Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. ""Snow,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. 

&gt; - Jon XIII ADwD

 - After reading heavily in his books and reading about prophecies, Rhaegar states ""It seems I must be a warrior"". Rhaegar is now dead, but this could hint at Jon being the warrior he read about, thus is the warrior of fire. The Undying even call Daenerys ""bride of fire"" in the House of Undying in a reference to Jon Snow.

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice (blue flower = Lynna Stark, Jon's mother), and filled the air with sweetness... mother of dragons, **bride of fire**...

&gt; - Daenerys IV ACoK

The reason why I think this Azor Ahai = Prince/Princess duality is perfect is because Jon is the Prince that was promised and will get with Daenerys, the Princess that was promised. That is why Maester Aemon emphasizes the fact that the translation can be one or the other, flickering back and forth like flame, and that dragons are both male and female. The duality also fits the Ice and Fire theme, in that Jon is Ice and Daenerys is fire.  Which is why Mel says in the show:

&gt;Varys: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King of the North, don't you want to see him again?

&gt;Melisandre: I've done my part. I've brought Ice and Fire together.

However, in the same right which Daenerys claims the Iron Throne actually gives Jon the right (birthright), it is important on Jon's part to marry Daenerys to solidify his claim to the Iron Throne.

Ice is to marry Fire.

###GRRM: on ASoIaF and Lord of the Rings

It is important to see how LotR influenced GRRM and ASoIaF

&gt;**I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.**

&gt;**Martin has called J.R.R. Tolkien his great model in shaping the overarching plot of his series.** If you look at Lord of the Rings, it begins with a tight focus and all the characters are together. Then by end of the first book the Fellowship splits up and they have different adventures. I did the same thing. Everybody is at Winterfell in the beginning except for Dany, then they split up into groups, and ultimately those split up too. The intent was to fan out, then curve and come back together.

So GRRM has stated that JRR Tolkien (maybe George R Martin chose ""Richard"" as his confirmation name to become George RR Martin in order to mimick JRR Tolkien?) served as a model for the **overarching plot** of the series. GRRM gives the Stark family as an single example, saying that it is modeled after the Fellowship, which were together at the beginning but became split due to a series of events.  You can even see that he modeled Jon after Aragorn:

Jon Snow/Aegon(?*)| Estel/Aragorn| 
:- | -:
Descended from the Targaryen Kings.|Descended from the Kings of Gondor.
Mother is descended from the first King in the North.| Mother was descended from the first chieftain of the Dnedain Aranarth, the rightful King of the Northern Kingdom. 
Takes after his mother in her Stark coloring with grey eyes and dark hair.|Takes after his mother in her Dnedain coloring with grey eyes and dark hair
The Targaryens left Valyria, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the Doom came and much of the peninsula was swallowed by the sea, and kept the last dragons with them, dragons being the signature creatures of Valyria. The dragon would become the sigil of House Targaryen, the kings of Westeros.|The Elendils left Numenor, the highest human civilization that fell to a cataclysmic event, before the island was swallowed by the sea, and kept what would be the last line of White Trees, a mystical tree from Numenor and the island's signature tree that became the sigil of House Elendil, the kings of Gondor.
Jon leads the Night's Watch in the far North. Those who go north of the wall are called rangers| Aragorn led the rangers of the North.
Just before birth, Jon's father was killed while pursuing rebels. Jon's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Winterfell by Ned. At the bidding of Ned, his lineage was kept secret, as Eddard feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Rhaegar's heir became known. Jon was renamed Jon Snow to hide his existence from Robert Baratheon and his servants| When two years old, his father was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn's mother wanted him to be fostered and protected in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel to hide his existence from Sauron and his servants.

\*The show has already made its mind for Jon's actual name, but the books aren't clear on this.  I think its fitting.  For Aegon was said to forge the Seven Kingdoms with Dragonflame while Jon/Aegon unify, lead, and rebuild the Seven Kingdom that was frozen over and shattered by the Others. As Rhaegar states, ""What better name for a King?"". Plus I wouldn't suspect D&amp;D would deviate from the books on something this big.

Aragorn, in a sense, was the Prince that was Promised of LotR. Aragorn, much like the TPtwP and the Legend of Lightbringer, used Andril: the Flame of the West reforged from the shards of Narsil to fight against Sauron. You will see where I am going with this later. However, as I see this objection to TPtwP being one person and lightbringer being his sword to win against the Great Other, it is important to note that Aragorn isn't the reason why the War of the Ring was won.  Aragorn certainly was a factor in winning the War of the Ring, but he was not the sole reason. Similarly, I do not think Jon nor lightbringer is going to be the sole reason why the living wins the War of the Dawn.

##The Red Comet and Lightbringer: The Sword of Ice becomes Fire


Now this is where I have gotten a lot of flak and ask for temporary suspension of disbelief not because there isn't strong evidence, as you shall see there is *very* strong evidence and I have found some more quotes to support my claim, but because it conflicts with many people's view/interpretation of lightbringer. Again, I take the law of parsimony and state that there is no trickery on GRRM's part and that he intends lightbringer as an actual sword because there is no reason to suggest that it is anything else.

The Red Comet appears not in *A Clash of Kings*, but in *A Game of Thrones* right after Ned Stark's beheading WITH his greatsword Ice.

&gt;""I  I  I "" Arya sobbed.

&gt;The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. ""Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy."" Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a  a noise  a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. (Ned Stark is beheaded) The old man's fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. ""Look at me. Yes, that's the way of it, at me."" Sour wine perfumed his breath. ""Remember, boy?""...

&gt;""Know me now, do you? There's a bright boy."" He spat. ""They're done here. You'll be coming with me, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. ""Shut, I said.""...

&gt;As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears.

&gt; - Chapter 65 Arya V AGoT

&gt;""For a certainty,"" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.

&gt; - Chapter 66 Bran VII AGoT

Daenerys then takes this as a sign at the end of *A Game of Thrones* to light a pyre to raise her dragons, the same comet which is said to herald the Prince/Princess that was promised, the same comet said to mean of fire and blood, the same comet that is said to mean the coming of dragons, both literal and the three heads. The comet appears *the chapter after* Ned Stark's beheading with Ice.

If the Red Comet is a sign of AA coming in this time, then it also follows that the creation of lightbringer is soon to follow.

&gt;""**With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword**, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. **A king should bear a kingly weapon.**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. **And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him**.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""**It is the sword that slays the season**,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt; - Bran I ACoK

Here we have three quotes from first chapters of PoV characters at the beginning of ACoK that are all in reference to the Red Comet, which appeared after Ned Stark was beheaded with Ice. It seems obvious that this ties to Ned Stark's Ice being Lightbringer. Ned Stark's Ice is going to become reforged into a sword called Fire, which is fitting considering that the series name is *A Song of Ice and Fire* and has Ned's Ice on the front cover of the first book. Jon snow wielding Ice reforged into Fire reflects the theme. 

Not only does these passages seem to imply it, but in the *current* state of Ned Stark's Ice is in two derivative swords from it: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper. In the books, Tywin tried to get Gendry's master Tobho Mott to infuse the two swords with crimson red:

&gt;Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black, as was true here as well. **But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore. ""How did you get this patterning? I've never seen anything like it.""**

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The red is infused like a bloody wave on a black steely shore and the two colors didn't touch.

If Ned Stark's greatsword Ice becomes reforged from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail into one sword, then it seems likely that the red coloring in both of the swords can become uniformly red throughout the sword and become the prophesied Red Sword called lightbringer. On the Season 7 lore history, Thoros of Myr narrates a segment on the Lord of Light, Azor Ahai, and lightbringer and his wording is interesting:

&gt;According to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and **reforge the great sword** Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with the lifeblood of a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much, at least, the Lord of Light is clear on.[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJ7h5rwvjs)

""Reforge the great sword"".  Greatsword, like Ned Stark's Ice?  Many say that this is a silly idea because it is a huge sword, but its description makes it seem like the size of a regular greatsword (~5 ft, wide as the width of a hand) and greatswords were commonly used in war.  And if greatswords can be used in war, then a Valyrian Steel greatsword is lighter than regular steel greatsword and most certainly can be used in battle much like when Ned used it at the breach of the Pyke during the Greyjoy rebellion.

But I strongly suspect that the Army of the Dead will be lured into King's Landing and that they will blow up King's Landing.  However, the Night King will still be alive with wight Viserion and so they reforged Ice into one sword to be used against a dragon.

The Legend of Lightbringer

&gt;""...I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

Ned Stark's Ice was melted down and worked into two swords and tempered in water.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

This is going to involve Cersei's death.  Now, Cersei's death was said by Maggy:

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

So people take this as Cersei being choked to death. However, the valonqar's hands wrapping around her throat, I believe, signifies her becoming a captured lion.  And there has been plenty of foreshadowing of Arya being the one to kill Cersei.

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

Cersei spends her entire time being paranoid that Tyrion will be the one to kill her. However, Arya knows OF Maegor's tunnels but Tyrion knows *how* to navigate them to get where Arya can kill Cersei.  So I think Arya will use Jaime's face as Tyrion's catspaw to kill Cersei. GRRM on prophecies:

&gt;[Laughs] Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? Thats the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

Arya found out about the tunnels while training by capturing cats.  Tyrion knows where it leads to, so he will be able to help Arya kill Cersei.  I think Arya is going to use Jaime's face, as Arya is, indeed, left-handed and can play the role of Jaime, and there is a refrain that keeps popping up in the series that /r/asoiaf took as ""Jaime's hands will strangle Cersei"", but it goes:

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**...""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

The hands of gold refers to Tyrion, as the chain of the Hand of the King is golden interlocked hands and Tyrion's person sigil is a golden hand surrounded by gold lions on a crimson field, but I think it is a double entendre on GRRM's part to say that ""Both of Cersei's brothers, Tyrion nor Jaime (who has a golden hand) is the valonqar, but a woman is"". Arya being Jaime would mean she would have Widow's Wail, one of the two swords that came from Ned's Ice.  The show further emphasizes this idea with Ed Sheeran singing Symon silver tongue's song up to the refrain where all the Lannister men sing: 

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm. For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" (They stop and look at Arya).

The scene concludes with Arya saying:

&gt;""I'm going to kill the queen"" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9OoIQUTPaQ)

Then capturing a lion is much like Arya's training to capture cats.  Even the Hound taught Arya where to find the heart to kill a person.

&gt;Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?""

&gt;She nodded. ""Tomorrow we're going to catch cats.""

&gt; - Eddard VII AGoT

&gt;Catching cats was hard...

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of Cats**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat* (Rains of Castamere refers to Lannister lion = cat)

&gt; - Arya VII ASoS

&gt;The queen watched his face, wary as a cat.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;Cersei hissed like an angry cat

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;She slapped him. Jaime's arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick . . . but this cat had a cripple's stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek.


&gt; - Cersei I AFfC
&gt;Cersei summoned Jocelyn to brush her hair out whilst she slipped off her shoes and stretched like a cat.

&gt; - Cersei IV AFfC

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

And Arya has a chapter in TWoW where she pays a character named ""Mercy"" in a play about Tyrion called the ""Bloody Hand"".  The show takes a twist on this chapter.  Arya is sent on a redemption mission to kill the actor who plays Cersei Lannister.  Arya advises the actor to rework her speech about Joffrey dying, stating that a mother who watched her firstborn die would be more angry (likey reflecting on Catelyn watching Robb die infront of her).  The actor asks for Arya's name and Arya says ""Mercy"". [link](https://youtu.be/mJE87JlWZig?t=79)

The reason why it is more appealing for Arya to kill Cersei is because the undoing of the Stark family was at the hands of the Lannisters, and Cersei played a huge role in it. Arya is one of two characters that experienced the beheading of Ned as a well as the Red Wedding.

The father of the faith of the seven is sought out for Divine Justice, and his description perfectly fits Ned. The people who set up Ned to be imprisoned and then beheaded are: Janos - beheaded by Jon Snow, Littlefinger - killed by Arya at Sansa's sentencing, Cersei - killed by Arya.  So you can see where the idea of divine justice comes into play.

Ned Stark stated that it was the madness of mercy that made him confront Cersei. [link to the scene](https://youtu.be/Q-GSOHCVPfA?t=80). Ned didn't want Robert to go on a rage and murder Cersei's children, as the books reveal that the murder of Elia Martell's children really had a toll on Ned and Ned didn't want Robert to go Tywin on Cersei's kids, but Ned also felt that he couldn't keep the truth of Cersei's children secret from Robert so he confronted Cersei about it in *hopes* that she would flee Westeros for her children. If you look at the valonqar prophecy about her children and Arya killing Cersei in an act of mercy, it parallels Ned's mercy to Cersei.  The valonqar prophecy states that Cersei's children will die ""gold will be the crowns.  Gold their shrouds"" and then it moves to the idea of Cersei going mad with her grief to the valonqar killing her (Arya giving her the gift of mercy) ""when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you"". You can read more about Arya delivering Ned's justice in my post ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy"". (I am unable to post it links to other subreddits, but it'll pop up if you google it.)

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?""

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""The madness of mercy,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV AGoT

&gt;Corruption! There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge (the Red Comet)! We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon... There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!

&gt; - Tyrion V ACoK

&gt;Catelyn: The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it's an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue. I wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.

&gt;Brynden: That thing's not crimson. Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That's blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.

&gt; - Catelyn I ACoK

The fact that Arya will be part of the second forging of lightbringer is reflected in her first two paragraphs of her first chapter:

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

And her naming her sword ""Needle"" after her stitch-work is symbolic that she is going to be part of the ""stitching together"" of Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail  and the restoration of the Stark family much like Narsil reforged into Andril was the restoration of the line of the Kings of Gondor.

I actually believe that Gendry will be the one to reforge Ned Stark's Ice, as his master was the one who worked the greatsword into two separate blades and he was the one to call the Red Comet ""red sword"".  And, in a chapter that is full of symbolism, Catelyn was praying and says this of the smith:

&gt;Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. **She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken**.

&gt; - Catelyn IV ACoK

The next instant of forging lightbringer:

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

Daenerys becoming a wight/Other.

I do have a strong feeling that Ned Stark's Ice will become reforged into Fire because of all of the evidence that is presented.  The reforging of the Stark ancestral sword that was used to cut off Ned's head, which caused the family to further split up, is a symbolic of the Starks coming back together.  Much like the splitting of the sword into two Lannister swords is symbolic of the Stark family being scattered by the doing of Lannisters.  [The scene with Tywin where Oathkeeper and WW was made reflects this as Ice was sheathed in a Greywind's pelt and after the splitting of the swords Tywin throws the direwolf's pelt into the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcr_mj3VTTQ).

We all know how Dragonglass plunged into a Humans heart created a Whitewalker. The Theorie i referred to (Videolink to it:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng42UweCnLI**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng42UweCnLI)**) states that another human was created by having a valyrian Steel Sword plunged through her heart which lead me to write this super Long comment below the Video but i thought it is too much fun to think into and should be posted for everybody to being read here as well.\]**

dragonglass and valyrian steel seem to have same magical properties. i think the connecting link is dragonfire. valyrian steel and Dragonglass propably are both imbued with it. the reason no Smiths can reproduce valyrian steel is propably due to no Dragons being around the Knowledge of how to utilize their magical properties for the steel was put aside, lost or it still resides somewhere in the ruins of valyria which is currently crawling with stonemen. this is also the reason why the current Smiths can reforge it by smelting it down but they cannot recreate it. 

but then again the Question arises why something touched by dragonfire, plunged through the very core of a human being turns them undead and drains the life and warmth from them, leaving Nothing but a seemingly empty Cold husk. logically something imbued with potent energetical dragonfire should have the opposite effect of energizing or burning but this seems rather void and vengeful, absorbing all Energy of Body and Soul that it can get its Hands on. perhaps the valyrian steel and dragonglass are won through dragonblood and i kinda get the Feeling or have the assumption that Dragons might be the emmissaries or perhaps even children of the Lord of light and killing them for worldy gains is a sacrileg. so i could see why crystalized dragonblood (dragonglass) and dragonblood\-forged weapons would be cursed by him, her or it. 

but given that they are cursed they are also the key to either lift the curse (killing whitewalkers) or finish the Job in taking the last bit of Soul, life force and Energy of the victim, leaving them crumbling to dust as seen with the couple of whitewalkers that have already been slain by that type of weapon. (why something that is bringing a curse and Lifting it at the same time at first glance seems very contradicting but actually might not be it you can see in the last Paragraph at the \*)  going further down the Rabbithole it is worth thinking About what brought About the ruin of valyria and the loss of all the Knowledge. a civilisation so advanced that even to this day in game of throne Terms People cannot reproduce their technological feats.  from an earlier Episode we know that Dragons bring About a age of great magical power and they boost the magic capabilities of all the magical beings around them greatly. think About it, in old valyria Dragons were propably so common that they were regarded as more expandable and knowing human nature and the clichee endings of human high civilisations that get too greedy at some Point, opening the pandoras box at some time which leads to their ruin. let's assume the Lord of light, his emmissaries the Dragons and the valyrian People were Living together Hand in Hand in harmony and happiness, but of Course some People tried to have more and be more than others out of greed and in order to do so they Need to become more powerful than their peers. 

how do you do that in a civilisation where magic is commonly practiced? you Need something to either boost your own magical prowess or to completly nullify the enemies magic to gain the upper hand. since valyrian steel seems to have magic\-countering abilities it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to believe that it could also have been used for armor to protect users from magic of all Kinds, even perhaps from dragonfire. greyscale might be a sickness derived from very brave individuals trying to directly infuse themselves with dragonblood to gain a magic boost which worked at first and later turned them into feral scaly creatures and since then like a curse plagued humankind for it's crimes. heck, perhaps even a crazy way more powerful and potent form of bloodmagic, dragonbloodmagic had its hand in the creation of the dragonglass and/or valyrian steel and since it might have lead to the downfall of that high civilisation that is also the reason why the late descendant of it ""normal"" blood magic is so frowned upon because it already once brought a time of a great  war or crysis About which perhaps even almost led to human extinction but more to this Topic later on. 

a civil war might have broken out in which Dragons were willingly killed by either one side or eventually both sides because the means justify the Ends which eventually led to the ruin of old valyria. further and further losing the Benevolenz of the Lord of light he retracted, losing all hope in humankind. he later on decided to Show his face again because he perhaps saw hope in the upcoming Generation, People strong enough and willing to do the Right Thing, to lead humanity back onto the Right path of Peace, justice and happiness (danaerys and jon). at this Point i'm starting to imagine that the Lord of light perhaps is a very old, powerful and huge Dragon hidden somewhere in a cave. Dragons are considered to be super intelligent. Maybe the Lord of light is so old and has grown so Mighty that he aquired abilities similiar to brans, seeing past and future Events, being able to telepathically communicate with other Living creatures and distribute portions of his power between his faithful subjects.    

another Thing that is very interesting in that aspect is, that melisandre used bloodmagic to fullfill the Lord of Lights will to kill remley baratheon. since blood magic is so frowned upon and it propably is even highly illegal to use and most People that aren't in the know About magic since it Pretty much died out with the Dragons (my guess) don't even know About it it makes me wonder why the Lord of light which is supposed to be this good character with this ultimate masterplan to save the world wields such cruel and dispicable magic. my guess is, that at some Point he might have turned mad by seeing how his emmissaries or Children have been slaughtered by man for their own personal gains and even the supposedly good ones turned bad and he wants to take Revenge on all of humankind.

the Lord of light Always has strucken me as wicked. being cruel with bloodmagic, Burning and killing People to utilize their life force for magic, yet seemingly pushing the as ""good"" and ""righteous"" perceived characters to further their or his ultimate Goal.   at this Point the final Nemesis in the game of thrones series might not even be the nightking but the Lord of light. the other gods seem to have become very passive, kinda letting nature take it's own Course. the only god activly meddling with human quaries is the Lord of light, either making him more or less powerful than the other gods, but definitely different. kinda sticking out like a sore thumb and not letting nature take its own Course which leads me to believe that the Lord of Lights Motives are selfish which in turn leads me to believe that it is actually a super powerful, yet mortal creature which only solidifies my ancient Dragon Theory as they usually grow more powerful the older they become.   

The Lord of Light, the legendary Sword lightbringer (lucifer = lightbringer), the disregard for human values (Burning pure People alive for power gains) all make this ""god"" seem vicious. He is fooling everybody with his Supernatural magic tricks into believing he is the real deal, that he is good because he is seemingly aiding humankind in a war against a obvious foe of which we don't know much yet, especially not that foes Motives... \*or perhaps this was all a Setup from the getgo. creating the whitewalkers with dragonglass that he willingly provided for the Children of the forest, thus creating two huge Forces that will nearly annihilate each other to seize Control in the Moment when they are the weakest. kinda reminds me of how littlefinger goes on About his Little powergrabs and schemes. :\^)

Sam will be the savior for House Tarly and heres why. 

First of all, after Drogon incinerated dad and brother, Sam is technically the only remaining Tarly even though hes taken the black. 

Secondly, Sam stole Heartsbane on the way to the Citadel so he has the ancestral sword which basically saved it from being melted by dragon fire. 

Lastly if all the signs point towards King Jon Targaryen, guess who has the ability to turn him in Lord Tarly. Stannis offered to do it for Jon once, so the show has already set the precedence that this is possible. 

In an interesting twist, Sam eventually becomes the savior and lord of the new House Tarly. ",31,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

We know that Dany had that prophecy of being betrayed. Blood. Gold. Love.

As far as I know we've had blood and gold. The question has been, who betrays her for love?

I have long held the belief that while we all love him, Tyrion is like any other character. He is neither black nor white, good or bad, he is grey. Yet we've mostly seen him do things we all define as good or right. Even killing his father seemed right given we were aware of the pain he has suffered at his hands.

But, this is Game of Thrones. Tyrion is clever and plays the game better than all others. I believe in Season 8 the conversation Tyrion had with Cersi that was hidden for us will be revealed. He bargained with her or promised her something.

I think that Tyrion will ultimately betray Dany. A betrayal for love. Is that love because he secretly fancies Dany or is that the love he ultimately always has for his family. Or is it a betrayal towards someone she loves, Jon? 

Always bet on the Lannisters, that's what he believes. 

I have a sinking suspicion that Tyrion is going to do something unexpected. Something that makes sense for his overall character but is tough for fans to take. Does that make him the ""bad guy""? There are no good and bad guys in GOT. 

I think Tyrion will do something that he believes to be right but that we the audience may have a hard time getting on board with because it will effect characters we love. But we also love Tyrion. Maybe that will be the bittersweet, something that is great from the POV of Tyrion yet not so much from other angles.

I think the whole season will be sprinkled with bittersweet moments so I don't think this will be the grand overall one but I am still convinced Tyrion's brains are going to come into play, just his actions may not seem clean cut to us.

I find that too many people watching see it as the good ones and then the bad ones and I reckon Season 8 will turn this thinking on its head and remind us that no single character is totally pure.

This one focusing on the Lannisters: Tyrion, Jaime, and Cersei. This will be the final part in my predictions for the character arcs of Season 8, the reason being is that I want to move on to doing more fan theories. But I will be doing an outlined version of my full predictions shortly after this with links to all four post in it. Anyways here are the links to the first three.

Arya: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

Sansa &amp; Bran: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8nbg4u/spoilers_my_predictions_for_bran_sansa_in_season_8/

Jon &amp; Daenerys: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8o1pr5/spoilers_predictions_for_daenerys_targaryen_and/

So anyways S7 ended with the targaryens united (maybe too united), The Starks United, and in a surprise twist the Lannisters completely divided, I think next season we will see the fall of House Lannister, With Cersei and Jaime dying AND Tyrion not have any children. Anyways I will start with Cersei, Cersei will end up having a miscarriage and with this and the fact the citizens are starting to riot due to a lack of food she grows more mad and paranoid, Euron will arrive with the Golden Company led by Harry Strickland and Cersei stats he can get his reward after he finishes one final task and that is to march North to Winterfell and sack it for its food which he does, he also sends some of his Ironborn to take Dragonstone and some of the GC to take Storms end. We see Cersei start to grow more mad and Paranoid as she has Qyburn sets up Wildfire barrels in the Red Keep that when set off will cause a chain reaction that blows up the whole city so if her enemies or the undead come a knocking it will be set off.

Anyways Euron arrives with food from WF and also three hostages. Varys, Tyrion, and Sansa though I will get into that when I get to Tyrion and I also talked alittle about this moment already with Sansa predictions. Cerseu later that evening marries Euron Greyjoy (with Euron taking the Lannister name or them combining the Lannister and Greyjoy name to GreyLannister? LannisJoy? Okay maybe not those two) and at the wedding Cersei meets Arya disguised in clothing similar to what Lyanna whore on her wedding day, Whom gets Cersei suspicious believing she is a child of Lyanna with Rhaegar (she probably also believes the story of Rhaegar raping Lyanna, though it would be cool if she SOMEHOW knew about Rhaegar and Lyanna actually truly loving each other) Cersei also becomes furious when she finds out Varys turned up missing. Anyways the next day Arya, Gendry, and Jaime and co. sneak into the Red Keep as Wights come near the city and Jon, Dany, and NK are fighting in the skies above KL and Euron is fighting Theon and Yara at Blackwater Bay.

Arya is given the chance to kill Cersei but chooses family over vengeance letting Jaime get the kill, With Jaime putting his sword right through Cerseis throat. Now lets get into Jaime. Jaime and Bronn will meet at the Crossroads Inn where Jaime will explain that he left Cersei and why he did and also he has a plan to get his own Army and march it down North to help Jon and co. Bronn goes to the Westerlands to get 300 or so Sellswords while Jaime goes to the Riverlands to get some Riverlands forces. Jaime goes to the Twins and Rosin explains Edmure escaped to the Neck to hideout there until things blow over (the actor who plays Edmure said he may not be coming back so this is how I would write him out) and says winter came for House Frey. Anyways Bronn and Jaime get there forces made up of 300 or so Sellswords, Frey bannermen, and Bannermen still loyal to House Tully.

When Jaime arrives he is not given nice looks from the Northern lords but he does apologize to Bran and Jon for his behaviour and also has a nice reunion with Brienne and during the battle in the North Jaime and Brienne will save Jon from three WWs, Anyways after the battle he and Brienne, Pod, and the Hound are send to KL to deal with Cersei, along the way they run in to Arya &amp; Gendry. They make it to KL Jaime and co. camp outside while Arya and Gendry sneak into the city, Varys finds them outside the city and shows them into the Sewers the next day, After Jaime kills Cersei they find out the Wights are entering the city. Jaime has Arya, Gendry, and Pod evacuate the city while him and Brienne find the barrels of wildfire. Jaime sets it off killing him and Brienne but also destroying the Wights that have made it inside the city. 

Now finally Tyrion, Tyrion I believe after the S7 finale will be concerned about Jon &amp; Dany being in love, as he feels it will create problems and also if there is a Heir (and yes that is an IF) then the whole breaking the wheel dream will be ruined as there will be a heir for the Iron Throne, he will have a reunion with Sansa when he arrives at WF and confront Dany about his concerns. When Euron and the GC surprise attack WF him, Varys, and Sansa will be taken hostage. Anyways the three will be taken to Cersei where it is revealed that Tyrion made a deal with Cersei that the child will live and be made Heir to Casterly Rock if she helps Jon and Dany however with her having a miscarriage and also her not keeping to her promise the deal was broken and Euron cuts Tyrion tongue out right in front of everybody. Tyrion and Sansa are thrown in a black cell and Sansa gives him motivational speech to get his hopes in Jon &amp; Dany back and that he is just as important as Jon &amp; Dany. He is saved with Sansa by Arya and in the end of this Tyrion is made Lord of Casterly Rock.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Anyways the three will be taken to Cersei where it is revealed that Tyrion made a deal with Cersei that the child will live and be made Heir to Casterly Rock if she helps Jon and Dany however with her having a miscarriage and also her not keeping to her promise the deal was broken and Euron cuts Tyrion tongue out right in front of everybody. Tyrion and Sansa are thrown in a black cell and Sansa gives him motivational speech to get his hopes in Jon &amp; Dany back and that he is just as important as Jon &amp; Dany. He is saved with Sansa by Arya and in the end of this Tyrion is made Lord of Casterly Rock.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

They choose Aegon. Up until season 7 of the show came along, we assumed there was only one Aegon, deceased son of Elia and Rhaegar. Now that we know Jon Snow's true identity being Aegon Targaryan, would it be crazy to think that maybe it wasn't Elia in the books, but rather Lyanna, just in a more cleaned up version. Maybe GRRM did not want to give too much away by making her bloody in a bed. If this is true, then Jon Snow is the Prince That Was Promised and he is the song of Ice and Fire, which in my opinion makes so much more sense than Elia and Rhegar's dead son being TPTWP and SOIAF.

We all know Jon is a true northmen and identifies himself as such. And that's unlikely ever to change. But I think we can all agree that the news of Jon's real parentage and status is going to mess with him a bit. It's likely to cause some friction with the Northern lords, and possibly even Sansa. Not to mention potentially jeopardize his relationship with Dany. I feel like there is going to be a scene early on after the reveal where Jon will be at somewhat of a crossroads. And just as Jon reminded Theon in S7E7, Theon will remind him that he doesn't have to choose whether he is a Dragon or a Wolf. He's both.",46,65,False,spoiler,,,,,

622,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-6-11,2018,6,11,3,8q2r1o,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] fAegon - role in show vs books,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8q2r1o/spoilers_faegon_role_in_show_vs_books/,GWillHunting,1528655237,"So, after reading the books, I became a pretty big fan of fAegon, regardless of whether he turns out to be fake or real. My question is - how do you think D&amp;D incorporated him into the show with the following:

1. Jon Snow's true name revealed to be Aegon Targaryen on the show. To me, this seems like a complete nod that they are fusing fAegon with Jon's character on the show. It wouldn't make any sense for Rhaegar to give two of his sons the exact same name - I'd be shocked if Jon's real name in the books was Aegon. So, D&amp;D went with Aegon as Jon's name on the show to kind of merge the characters to a degree.
2. Cersei getting the Golden Company next season. Since this is fAegon's army in the books, it seems that D&amp;D are also merging some of fAegons plotline into Cersei. 

I've read a couple posts on fAegon where people act like he's irrelevant or just some plot device to give Dany another challenge on her way to the throne. It's somewhat reasonable to think that fAegon overthrows Cersei and gains control of the throne - there's also that line ""the cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd"" which you can interpret as fAegon gaining the support of the realm. At this point, I really think that fAegon has a huge role in the story because he represents a real moral conundrum for Dany - this is supposedly her cousin who she now will have to take the throne from (assuming fAegon weds Arianne from Dorne, so he can't just wed Dany). Not to mention, in the books, he seems like a competent ruler, not some psychopath like Cersei or Joffrey. So, it would really create a split in who is in the right here - does Dany have the moral highground to take the throne from her supposed cousin that's just overthrown Cersei? 

Other posts I've read also act like if fAegon turns out to be fake (which I'll admit, is somewhat likely given the Blackfyre theories), he's suddenly a bad guy. I completely disagree, if anything, it makes me more sympathetic towards him - here's a kid who's been lied to his whole life about his family, ends up on the throne, only to find out he has no real claim to it. I can definitely see fAegon fighting Dany for the throne - it lines up with how Cersei is about to be given the Golden Company - but I definitely think readers will be somewhat split on who they're rooting for, unlike how everyone wants Dany to beat Cersei (assuming GRRM doesn't turn him into a clear villain in the future books).

There's also the possibility that fAegon represents one of the three heads of the dragon. Not to mention A Dance With Dragons part II. I understand that the show cut his character out because he has such a complex plotline that most of the casual viewers would have gotten completely lost, but I don't get it when people act like his exclusion from the show means that he really won't have an impact on the final outcome of the ending of Game of Thrones, because in my opinion, he's one of the most important characters.",34,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

This will be the final part in my predictions for the character arcs of Season 8, the reason being is that I want to move on to doing more fan theories. But I will be doing an outlined version of my full predictions shortly after this with links to all four post in it. Anyways here are the links to the first three.

Arya: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

Sansa &amp; Bran: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8nbg4u/spoilers_my_predictions_for_bran_sansa_in_season_8/

So anyways S7 ended with the targaryens united (maybe too united), The Starks United, and in a surprise twist the Lannisters completely divided, I think next season we will see the fall of House Lannister, With Cersei and Jaime dying AND Tyrion not have any children. Anyways I will start with Cersei, Cersei will end up having a miscarriage and with this and the fact the citizens are starting to riot due to a lack of food she grows more mad and paranoid, Euron will arrive with the Golden Company led by Harry Strickland and Cersei stats he can get his reward after he finishes one final task and that is to march North to Winterfell and sack it for its food which he does, he also sends some of his Ironborn to take Dragonstone and some of the GC to take Storms end. We see Cersei start to grow more mad and Paranoid as she has Qyburn sets up Wildfire barrels in the Red Keep that when set off will cause a chain reaction that blows up the whole city so if her enemies or the undead come a knocking it will be set off.

Anyways Euron arrives with food from WF and also three hostages. Varys, Tyrion, and Sansa though I will get into that when I get to Tyrion and I also talked alittle about this moment already with Sansa predictions. Cerseu later that evening marries Euron Greyjoy (with Euron taking the Lannister name or them combining the Lannister and Greyjoy name to GreyLannister? LannisJoy? Okay maybe not those two) and at the wedding Cersei meets Arya disguised in clothing similar to what Lyanna whore on her wedding day, Whom gets Cersei suspicious believing she is a child of Lyanna with Rhaegar (she probably also believes the story of Rhaegar raping Lyanna, though it would be cool if she SOMEHOW knew about Rhaegar and Lyanna actually truly loving each other) Cersei also becomes furious when she finds out Varys turned up missing. Anyways the next day Arya, Gendry, and Jaime and co. sneak into the Red Keep as Wights come near the city and Jon, Dany, and NK are fighting in the skies above KL and Euron is fighting Theon and Yara at Blackwater Bay.

Arya is given the chance to kill Cersei but chooses family over vengeance letting Jaime get the kill, With Jaime putting his sword right through Cerseis throat. Now lets get into Jaime. Jaime and Bronn will meet at the Crossroads Inn where Jaime will explain that he left Cersei and why he did and also he has a plan to get his own Army and march it down North to help Jon and co. Bronn goes to the Westerlands to get 300 or so Sellswords while Jaime goes to the Riverlands to get some Riverlands forces. Jaime goes to the Twins and Rosin explains Edmure escaped to the Neck to hideout there until things blow over (the actor who plays Edmure said he may not be coming back so this is how I would write him out) and says winter came for House Frey. Anyways Bronn and Jaime get there forces made up of 300 or so Sellswords, Frey bannermen, and Bannermen still loyal to House Tully.

When Jaime arrives he is not given nice looks from the Northern lords but he does apologize to Bran and Jon for his behaviour and also has a nice reunion with Brienne and during the battle in the North Jaime and Brienne will save Jon from three WWs, Anyways after the battle he and Brienne, Pod, and the Hound are send to KL to deal with Cersei, along the way they run in to Arya &amp; Gendry. They make it to KL Jaime and co. camp outside while Arya and Gendry sneak into the city, Varys finds them outside the city and shows them into the Sewers the next day, After Jaime kills Cersei they find out the Wights are entering the city. Jaime has Arya, Gendry, and Pod evacuate the city while him and Brienne find the barrels of wildfire. Jaime sets it off killing him and Brienne but also destroying the Wights that have made it inside the city. 

Now finally Tyrion, Tyrion I believe after the S7 finale will be concerned about Jon &amp; Dany being in love, as he feels it will create problems and also if there is a Heir (and yes that is an IF) then the whole breaking the wheel dream will be ruined as there will be a heir for the Iron Throne, he will have a reunion with Sansa when he arrives at WF and confront Dany about his concerns. When Euron and the GC surprise attack WF him, Varys, and Sansa will be taken hostage. Anyways the three will be taken to Cersei where it is revealed that Tyrion made a deal with Cersei that the child will live and be made Heir to Casterly Rock if she helps Jon and Dany however with her having a miscarriage and also her not keeping to her promise the deal was broken and Euron cuts Tyrion tongue out right in front of everybody. Tyrion and Sansa are thrown in a black cell and Sansa gives him motivational speech to get his hopes in Jon &amp; Dany back and that he is just as important as Jon &amp; Dany. He is saved with Sansa by Arya and in the end of this Tyrion is made Lord of Casterly Rock.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Varys visits Ned in the dungeon in The Pointy End, he asks why Ned would tell Cersei that he knew the secret about her and Jaime, and Ned replies that he was trying to show her and her children mercy, because Robert would certainly kill them all when he found out. Varys replies that this mercy is what killed Robert, which I always took to mean that Cersei had a hand in killing Robert, which she pretty much admits to later on when she tortures that Septa. (I guess by making sure Lancel gave him tons of wine, so hed be slow and more likely to get hurt?)

But, Ned doesnt tell Cersei he knows about her and Jaime until the previous episode, You Win or You Die. By then, Robert had already left on his hunting trip. If Cersei did have a hand in Roberts death, she probably planned it out with Lancel before they left for the trip. So how did Ned warning Cersei out of mercy affect anything since Robert was already gone and his death was most likely already planned?

Ok, Im new to this and this is my first post, but here it goes. 

I was thinking today about Ned and his admission of guilt. What effect did his admission in front of the small folk have, if any?

Considering the mistreatment of lords by a king would break the feudal agreement that they all live under. So lets say when Rickard and Brandon were killed this was seen as unjust amongst  the lords and would therefore impact their decision to join the rebels cause. 

So basically does anyone think that if Ned would not have admitted to treason would more lords have sided with Robb? And also would any of them been more reluctant to join the crown?",5,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

 TINFOIL AF but....what if you need Valyrian Steel to kill Bran? If you're sending a hired assassin, why send them with such an valuable weapon? He's a little boy. The right assassin could have killed him with just about anything. So, what if the person who sent the catspaw knows something none of us know yet. Whatever in him makes him the next 3\-eyed raven, has been in him since birth imo. Think like the Avatar. He or she was always the avatar, but just had to be trained. He's always been the raven, but had to be trained. So the person who sent it would have to know who and what he was and know that he had to be killed with Valyrian steel.

It is generally obvious that Yi Ti, being in the far East of the known world, is representing of some of the better-known East Asian Countries (China, Japan etc.) Even so, the Westerosi know very little about the Yi Tese (Yi T-ish? How do you say it?) this generally represents the amount of knowledge Europeans had of the Far East in midieval times, (ie none) Which brings me to the next point.

**Sothoryos is Africa**

Yes it's kind of obvious that Sothoryos is a representation of Africa. Th Europeans generally knew little about the continent other than the Northern Coast, yet that was inhospitable enough to where they didn't try any further colonization until much later. Sothoryos is said to be huge, having deserts and mountains along with it's northern jungles. It's practically screaming Africa. So now that we established the fact that Planetos (The entire world) is an allegorical representation of Earth, I started speculating about the other landmass below the Shadow Lands.

**Ulthos is Australia**

Now, before the disbelief, just know, this is a silly theory that has no basis in fact. I posted it for brainfood and entertainment. Now, ulthos looks like a jungle on the part we see on the official WOIAF map. take into account that on the coasts of Australia there are some rainforests. What I'm saying is, I theorize that most of Ulthos is a massive desert. to keep in the theme of an Australian-type continent. It is even in the same location in relation to Australia on the Real world map. Now time for the massive, most stupid part of the entire theory.

**There are two other continents across the Summer Sea**

Okay, that might be a stretch, nut it most definitely keeps in the theme of the Planetos map being an allegorical representation of the Real World map. There could definitely be a ""North and South America"" west of Westeros across the Summer Sea. No one has found anything yet, so it might be pretty far. But, who knows? this theory was for fun. I hope you enjoyed reading this. I had fun writing it. (Gotta love formatting.)",6,11,False,self,,,,,

791,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-6-13,2018,6,13,17,8qqu44,self.gameofthrones,why i dislike daenerys so much,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8qqu44/why_i_dislike_daenerys_so_much/,dangerouslyordinary,1528878925,"for some reason i decided to share my opinion on dany (a lot of people thought at first that i like her) so yeah enjoy ig

so seasons 1,2 and 4 daenerys get a pass because she was ok in these seasons ig, even though i really liked her character only in season 1.

season 1 dany was very much her being her brother's sister. she did as he told, and through being married to drogo became exposed to more brutal, powerful side of life. it was through this new power that she was able to stand up to viserys, kill the witch that killed her unborn child and fucked with drogo,and inspired her to take charge in travelling to westeros and taking the iron throne. 
season 2 built upon this nicely, her whole travelling to qarth, trying to find ships etc. like season 1 she was engaging because she had real troubles to deal with.
then season 3 came along. this was the first instance of the writers pushing a dany agenda too strongly down the audience's throats. she became a lot less compelling this season because instead of real hardships and challenges, she just got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. her taking of the unsullied army was ridiculously cheesy and unrealistic, i'm supposed to believe that killing the guy in charge is all it takes to acquire this huge ass army, and his murder was completely justified? i'm supposed to believe just saying ""you're all free,but you can fight for me if you want"" is all it takes to get the entire army to fight for her truly with passion? it felt like they were trying to make a perfect leader out of her by making her go on a liberation streak (which shouldn't be the only thing a perfect ruler does obviously). what i didn't like about this was that it was just her vs nameless bad guys. nothing compelling there,and no truth there too. good and bad on both sides, yet the scenes painted her as some perfect person. as if there are no ethical dilemmas with taking these cities. now granted, this didn't bother me TOO much, this is more a criticism of how the filming and music was done in season 3 to try and paint her as some wholly good jesus-like figure. the worst part was the finale, her being held up by a bunch of former slaves whilst cheesy music plays way too much oh god. (was rewatching recently so it's been really stuck in my head) that was the first of MANY cheesy scores to play during her scenes. 
season 4 was actually a massive improvement, i'd go as far as saying i kinda liked watching her in season 4. the show finally introduced some moral dilemmas of her actions, her crucifying of the masters, drogon killing livestock and children, former slaves not liking the new life she's forced them into, it was something compelling and interesting for a change. she made some mistakes, but she listened carefully to the advice of jorah and barristan, and managed to make the right decision regarding these matters. hizdahr was a good display of how the ""bad guys"" dany's been up against aren't all just bad guys. there was this great quote from jorah - ""it's tempting to see your enemies as evil,all of them. but there's good and bad on both sides of every war ever fought."" 
ending the season on her locking up the dragons away was nice, it showed her thinking like a ruler and it was an emotional moment. it was also through these experiences she decided to stay in meereen to improve herself as a ruler and a liberator.
season 5 comes along and shits all over this. i had high hopes that the sons of harpy would build upon her season 4 dilemmas in a way that would force her to become smarter about how she deals with people that don't support her. jorah's gone, and they kill off barristan too for some reason (well actually it's d&amp;d's fault, just won't be getting into it). first thing she does in response? feeds masters to her dragons. that was a huge insult to everything barristan stood for,during the whole sons of the harpy situation he was the one pushing for fair trials, not impulsive murders. then this season she just changes as a character, she keeps having lame ass speeches like the ""i'm going to break the wheel"" which sounds kinda cool for the trailer, but barely carry any actual weight. and as though season 4 didn't happen, she goes back to viewing all her enemies as evil. she now hates the masters again, and even worse she now starts to genuinely perceive herself to be an all perfect ruler. when tyrion comes into town, she seems shocked when tyrion even suggests that she may not be worth his service. i don't know why, but for some reason emilia clarke decided to take an entirely different route with playing daenerys this season too. this season she just puts on this expressionless face for nearly all her scenes that aren't deliberately trying to be emotional. detached me from her character a lot. she also became a lot more argumentative and irrational this season. then there's this issue with drogon. i loved the fact that as her dragons grew she could no longer control them, that felt real. but then for some reason drogon flies in, saves her and flies off with her on his back. there was just no build up on this scene so it felt flat. (but ig they went for that ""a pet will protect its owner when in danger"". idk why i'm trying to explain d&amp;d's poorly written scenes, fuck them)
and the whole trying-to-touch-his-nose thing all season was so lame too. but anyway, season 5 undid all her learnings from the previous season. 
up next is season 6, i'm really hoping it'll be a redemption for dany. being captured by dothraki, i'm hoping for a season 3 jaime-esque redemption arc, coz in season 5 she became very entitled. too entitled. i was hoping that being a captive would bring her back to reality,and remind her of her roots with the dothraki in season 1. the dothraki are after all a good facilitator of how there is good and bad on both sides. they were good for her in season 1, but bad to others. boi could i have been further from the truth. instead she's entitled as ever, boasting about her titles to the khal [whatever his name was] in the most ridiculous scene ever.
 then that scene where she burns the khals rolls around with her cringy speech. this is one of those areas that the show is deliberately not explaining. they need her to have a large army and needed to come up with some way to get her out of captivity so they killed two birds with one stone. but they know this can't stand up to scrutiny so it doesn't get any. once she simultaneously murdered all their leaders and desecrated their holy site all of the dothraki joined her. 
like it's that liberation of the unsullied army all over again. apparently dothraki follow strength so it's fine ahhh i fucking hate that tho. and i'm supposed to be happy for her? fucking hell. (the biggest unanswered questions is where are the women, children, and non-fighting aged men? if dany brought them with her that makes no sense. it's already nonsensical how she can provision her army, but if she has to feed an even larger amount of civilians as well it's beyond absurd. but if she left the civilians in essos, then that means she managed to convince all the men to abandon their families to certain enslavement since they would be completely defenseless.) 
so she finally gets back to meereen with her army, and how do we see dany deal with this threat to revolt in her city? she unleashes the dothraki horde to kill them all. real nice. and ofc there's all happy music and d&amp;d are like ""yeah be happy! isn't this awesome? she's solving the situation."" 
but even tho season 5 had faults it at least acknowledged that the sons of the harpy couldn't be dealt with just sheer violence. you can't kill ideas, killing all those people shouldn't have done shit, if anything it would've made things even worse. not to mention the dothraki are savages. but yet we're supposed to watch that and think ""wow isn't dany great?"". bullshit, that wasn't a thing a great ruler would do. she learned absolutely nothing from her time with the dothraki, and absolutely nothing more about ruling. and for some reason all the dragons that she had massive problems with are all perfectly tame now? they do exactly as she wants them to do because .. reasons? (i think i actually mentioned some cringy ass excuse somewhere in this rant already) perfect. it just felt like more and more shit getting handed to her because it's convenient for the plot. but there's nothing compelling about that. why would i want to watch the adventures of someone that just gets whatever they want with no consequences? a good example of the no consequences situation would also be the fact that they killed off tommen just so that danny wouldn't have the moral dilemma of having to overthrow a child, d&amp;d will really do anything for her, won't they? it pisses me off. i don't want to watch her vs just bad guys. i used to be excited at the prospect of her travelling to westeros because i acknowledged it would be her versus other good people for a change, but the show just went and fucked all that didn't it? guess they couldn't risk dany looking bad in any sort of way. it'll be the same with cersei if she does give birth to her new child. she'll spare her or they're just gonna have cersei miscarry the child.
so yeah for some reason at the end of the season 6 she's like ""i'm ready now, i'm totally a competent ruler now"" yet she showed no evidence of having learned anything. if anything she became worse.
another thing to add to season 6 is that yeah of course the season ends on her getting greyjoy support, tyrell support and dornish support. as if she wasn't overpowered enough already. i seriously don't understand why they think we wanna see some overpowered person just get the support they need easy peasy. no controversy? the closest we got to controversy tbf was randyll and dickon's death in season 7. i liked that they put tyrion and dany on the spot.
season 7 rocks about and she's now pushing this narrative that she's taking the 7 kingdoms because she wants to help the people. are you fucking kidding me? if you cared about people you'd have stayed in essos and ensured slavery actually ended. you wanna fight oppression? there's your oppression. but i guess if she just admitted she was there to conquer it would make her look bad? well done d&amp;d. this season she's just portrayed as the perfect person that believes everything she does is right and moral, when it isn't. she justifies everything because she just thinks everyone that's against her is evil. that annoys me. and to build onto to what i was saying about her in season 5, emilia clarke's acting has just gone for some reason. like i believe she can act, but it's like she chooses not to in these later seasons and it's so frustrating to watch. or maybe it's just d&amp;d's fault, they're giving her the instructions on how to portray her character (? man why am i trying to defend her). but yeah overall i just can't stand d&amp;d trying to make everything super easy for her, painting everyone that's against her as evil and her as always justified, her long cringey speeches, and her sense of entitlement. you didn't see seasons 1-4 dany saying she'd take the 7 kingdoms in order to help the people i mean come on. she's just lost all the compelling traits and it sucks. to be perfectly honest i just see her now as catfood for feminists. she's supposedly perfect, she's supposedly powerful, she talks some smack, and she makes speeches. all without the grit that makes a character interesting. yet somehow she gets shitload of screentime. oh right d&amp;d we get it, she's yo fav.
and then we have daenerys doing the following for her allies: 
yara ignored 
ellaria ignored
olenna dead 
(with no word about losing them on a personal level)
berating tyrion publicly and questioning his loyalties more than once
threatening to burn varys alive (who delivered dany the dornish and tyrells)
holding her only (and newest) ally prisoner on her island until he capitulated to her demands
delivered the dragon to the greatest enemy of the new ally, an enemy that ally came to her specifically to seek help in destroying
burned a large percentage of the food with an impending long night on the not-too-distant-horizon and 
wasted time brokering peace with someone who would have betrayed them anyway (no shade to cersei, i love the fact she did that)
ugh 

i defo rambled on here, so sorry if that's not my most coherent argument. it just annoys me how wrong they went with her arc after season 4 ended. like game of thrones wasn't all about people just fighting bad guys and getting what they want. it was about real conflict where there are no easy choices. real conflict where your enemies aren't just evil, and you have to question the morality of your own actions. real conflict usually for power. all of these themes have been stripped from dany's story and it sucks dicks. they can't even keep the power aspect since it's now just her taking over the westeros to benefit the people of westeros.

i just thought of another reason, but for me daenerys' story is the epitome of what i don't like about what the show has become. lack of complexity,lack of scheming,generic good vs evil,lack of emotional moments,plot armour,lack of moral conflict,cheese/cliche tropes,forced quotable lines (i swear half her speeches are just so they can have cool sounding words to put in trailers),too much magic, too many ex machinas. these are all things i find popping up in her story more than anyone else's, which ofc plays a big part of why i don't like watching her character on the show. i do believe her story didn't always suffer from these disadvantages,alas that is not the case anymore.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

(i think i actually mentioned some cringy ass excuse somewhere in this rant already) perfect. it just felt like more and more shit getting handed to her because it's convenient for the plot. but there's nothing compelling about that. why would i want to watch the adventures of someone that just gets whatever they want with no consequences? a good example of the no consequences situation would also be the fact that they killed off tommen just so that danny wouldn't have the moral dilemma of having to overthrow a child, d&amp;d will really do anything for her, won't they? it pisses me off. i don't want to watch her vs just bad guys. i used to be excited at the prospect of her travelling to westeros because i acknowledged it would be her versus other good people for a change, but the show just went and fucked all that didn't it? guess they couldn't risk dany looking bad in any sort of way. it'll be the same with cersei if she does give birth to her new child. she'll spare her or they're just gonna have cersei miscarry the child.
so yeah for some reason at the end of the season 6 she's like ""i'm ready now, i'm totally a competent ruler now"" yet she showed no evidence of having learned anything. if anything she became worse.
another thing to add to season 6 is that yeah of course the season ends on her getting greyjoy support, tyrell support and dornish support. as if she wasn't overpowered enough already. i seriously don't understand why they think we wanna see some overpowered person just get the support they need easy peasy. no controversy? the closest we got to controversy tbf was randyll and dickon's death in season 7. i liked that they put tyrion and dany on the spot.
season 7 rocks about and she's now pushing this narrative that she's taking the 7 kingdoms because she wants to help the people. are you fucking kidding me? if you cared about people you'd have stayed in essos and ensured slavery actually ended. you wanna fight oppression? there's your oppression. but i guess if she just admitted she was there to conquer it would make her look bad? well done d&amp;d. this season she's just portrayed as the perfect person that believes everything she does is right and moral, when it isn't. she justifies everything because she just thinks everyone that's against her is evil. that annoys me. and to build onto to what i was saying about her in season 5, emilia clarke's acting has just gone for some reason. like i believe she can act, but it's like she chooses not to in these later seasons and it's so frustrating to watch. or maybe it's just d&amp;d's fault, they're giving her the instructions on how to portray her character (? man why am i trying to defend her). but yeah overall i just can't stand d&amp;d trying to make everything super easy for her, painting everyone that's against her as evil and her as always justified, her long cringey speeches, and her sense of entitlement. you didn't see seasons 1-4 dany saying she'd take the 7 kingdoms in order to help the people i mean come on. she's just lost all the compelling traits and it sucks. to be perfectly honest i just see her now as catfood for feminists. she's supposedly perfect, she's supposedly powerful, she talks some smack, and she makes speeches. all without the grit that makes a character interesting. yet somehow she gets shitload of screentime. oh right d&amp;d we get it, she's yo fav.
and then we have daenerys doing the following for her allies: 
yara ignored 
ellaria ignored
olenna dead 
(with no word about losing them on a personal level)
berating tyrion publicly and questioning his loyalties more than once
threatening to burn varys alive (who delivered dany the dornish and tyrells)
holding her only (and newest) ally prisoner on her island until he capitulated to her demands
delivered the dragon to the greatest enemy of the new ally, an enemy that ally came to her specifically to seek help in destroying
burned a large percentage of the food with an impending long night on the not-too-distant-horizon and 
wasted time brokering peace with someone who would have betrayed them anyway (no shade to cersei, i love the fact she did that)
ugh 

i defo rambled on here, so sorry if that's not my most coherent argument. it just annoys me how wrong they went with her arc after season 4 ended. like game of thrones wasn't all about people just fighting bad guys and getting what they want. it was about real conflict where there are no easy choices. real conflict where your enemies aren't just evil, and you have to question the morality of your own actions. real conflict usually for power. all of these themes have been stripped from dany's story and it sucks dicks. they can't even keep the power aspect since it's now just her taking over the westeros to benefit the people of westeros.

i just thought of another reason, but for me daenerys' story is the epitome of what i don't like about what the show has become. lack of complexity,lack of scheming,generic good vs evil,lack of emotional moments,plot armour,lack of moral conflict,cheese/cliche tropes,forced quotable lines (i swear half her speeches are just so they can have cool sounding words to put in trailers),too much magic, too many ex machinas. these are all things i find popping up in her story more than anyone else's, which ofc plays a big part of why i don't like watching her character on the show. i do believe her story didn't always suffer from these disadvantages,alas that is not the case anymore.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

797,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-6-13,2018,6,13,18,8qr64d,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] why i dislike daenerys so much,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8qr64d/spoilers_why_i_dislike_daenerys_so_much/,dangerouslyordinary,1528883322,"for some reason i decided to share my opinion on daenerys (people think at first that i really like her) so enjoy ig 

so seasons 1,2 and 4 daenerys get a pass because she was ok in these seasons ig, even though i really liked her character only in season 1.

season 1 dany was very much her being her brother's sister. she did as he told, and through being married to drogo became exposed to more brutal, powerful side of life. it was through this new power that she was able to stand up to viserys, kill the witch that killed her unborn child and fucked with drogo,and inspired her to take charge in travelling to westeros and taking the iron throne. 
season 2 built upon this nicely, her whole travelling to qarth, trying to find ships etc. like season 1 she was engaging because she had real troubles to deal with.
then season 3 came along. this was the first instance of the writers pushing a dany agenda too strongly down the audience's throats. she became a lot less compelling this season because instead of real hardships and challenges, she just got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. her taking of the unsullied army was ridiculously cheesy and unrealistic, i'm supposed to believe that killing the guy in charge is all it takes to acquire this huge ass army, and his murder was completely justified? i'm supposed to believe just saying ""you're all free,but you can fight for me if you want"" is all it takes to get the entire army to fight for her truly with passion? it felt like they were trying to make a perfect leader out of her by making her go on a liberation streak (which shouldn't be the only thing a perfect ruler does obviously). what i didn't like about this was that it was just her vs nameless bad guys. nothing compelling there,and no truth there too. good and bad on both sides, yet the scenes painted her as some perfect person. as if there are no ethical dilemmas with taking these cities. now granted, this didn't bother me TOO much, this is more a criticism of how the filming and music was done in season 3 to try and paint her as some wholly good jesus-like figure. the worst part was the finale, her being held up by a bunch of former slaves whilst cheesy music plays way too much oh god. (was rewatching recently so it's been really stuck in my head) that was the first of MANY cheesy scores to play during her scenes. 
season 4 was actually a massive improvement, i'd go as far as saying i kinda liked watching her in season 4. the show finally introduced some moral dilemmas of her actions, her crucifying of the masters, drogon killing livestock and children, former slaves not liking the new life she's forced them into, it was something compelling and interesting for a change. she made some mistakes, but she listened carefully to the advice of jorah and barristan, and managed to make the right decision regarding these matters. hizdahr was a good display of how the ""bad guys"" dany's been up against aren't all just bad guys. there was this great quote from jorah - ""it's tempting to see your enemies as evil,all of them. but there's good and bad on both sides of every war ever fought."" 
ending the season on her locking up the dragons away was nice, it showed her thinking like a ruler and it was an emotional moment. it was also through these experiences she decided to stay in meereen to improve herself as a ruler and a liberator.
season 5 comes along and shits all over this. i had high hopes that the sons of harpy would build upon her season 4 dilemmas in a way that would force her to become smarter about how she deals with people that don't support her. jorah's gone, and they kill off barristan too for some reason (well actually it's d&amp;d's fault, just won't be getting into it). first thing she does in response? feeds masters to her dragons. that was a huge insult to everything barristan stood for,during the whole sons of the harpy situation he was the one pushing for fair trials, not impulsive murders. then this season she just changes as a character, she keeps having lame ass speeches like the ""i'm going to break the wheel"" which sounds kinda cool for the trailer, but barely carry any actual weight. and as though season 4 didn't happen, she goes back to viewing all her enemies as evil. she now hates the masters again, and even worse she now starts to genuinely perceive herself to be an all perfect ruler. when tyrion comes into town, she seems shocked when tyrion even suggests that she may not be worth his service. i don't know why, but for some reason emilia clarke decided to take an entirely different route with playing daenerys this season too. this season she just puts on this expressionless face for nearly all her scenes that aren't deliberately trying to be emotional. detached me from her character a lot. she also became a lot more argumentative and irrational this season. then there's this issue with drogon. i loved the fact that as her dragons grew she could no longer control them, that felt real. but then for some reason drogon flies in, saves her and flies off with her on his back. there was just no build up on this scene so it felt flat. (but ig they went for that ""a pet will protect its owner when in danger"". idk why i'm trying to explain d&amp;d's poorly written scenes, fuck them)
and the whole trying-to-touch-his-nose thing all season was so lame too. but anyway, season 5 undid all her learnings from the previous season. 
up next is season 6, i'm really hoping it'll be a redemption for dany. being captured by dothraki, i'm hoping for a season 3 jaime-esque redemption arc, coz in season 5 she became very entitled. too entitled. i was hoping that being a captive would bring her back to reality,and remind her of her roots with the dothraki in season 1. the dothraki are after all a good facilitator of how there is good and bad on both sides. they were good for her in season 1, but bad to others. boi could i have been further from the truth. instead she's entitled as ever, boasting about her titles to the khal [whatever his name was] in the most ridiculous scene ever.
 then that scene where she burns the khals rolls around with her cringy speech. this is one of those areas that the show is deliberately not explaining. they need her to have a large army and needed to come up with some way to get her out of captivity so they killed two birds with one stone. but they know this can't stand up to scrutiny so it doesn't get any. once she simultaneously murdered all their leaders and desecrated their holy site all of the dothraki joined her. 
like it's that liberation of the unsullied army all over again. apparently dothraki follow strength so it's fine ahhh i fucking hate that tho. and i'm supposed to be happy for her? fucking hell. (the biggest unanswered questions is where are the women, children, and non-fighting aged men? if dany brought them with her that makes no sense. it's already nonsensical how she can provision her army, but if she has to feed an even larger amount of civilians as well it's beyond absurd. but if she left the civilians in essos, then that means she managed to convince all the men to abandon their families to certain enslavement since they would be completely defenseless.) 
so she finally gets back to meereen with her army, and how do we see dany deal with this threat to revolt in her city? she unleashes the dothraki horde to kill them all. real nice. and ofc there's all happy music and d&amp;d are like ""yeah be happy! isn't this awesome? she's solving the situation."" 
but even tho season 5 had faults it at least acknowledged that the sons of the harpy couldn't be dealt with just sheer violence. you can't kill ideas, killing all those people shouldn't have done shit, if anything it would've made things even worse. not to mention the dothraki are savages. but yet we're supposed to watch that and think ""wow isn't dany great?"". bullshit, that wasn't a thing a great ruler would do. she learned absolutely nothing from her time with the dothraki, and absolutely nothing more about ruling. and for some reason all the dragons that she had massive problems with are all perfectly tame now? they do exactly as she wants them to do because .. reasons?

And I've done well in avoiding that information so far, only accidentally seeing that there may be a WW battle at Winterfell and apparently the final shot of Dany is supposed to be a shot of her arm. I'm fine with that.

But I've obviously come across the news that we'll be waiting until 2019 for it to release. And I also know they're sort of close to wrapping up shooting. So has there been any news released or does anyone have an educated estimate as to when in 2019 season 8 will be airing? Are we talking January/in winter or will it be delayed until spring/summer like season 7 was?

815,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-6-14,2018,6,14,0,8qt32x,self.gameofthrones,"[SPOILERS] - So Many End Game Theory Attempts, Let's have a Go Together",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8qt32x/spoilers_so_many_end_game_theory_attempts_lets/,Caesar3890,1528902035,"Okay I have noticed a lot of end game theories recently, people pushing theories and almost shoving them down our throats, some lost in total delusion of their favourite characters and others just small received theories without much attention. I want to try and break the main points we have to work out and see if we can have a go at it, I welcome all criticism and admit I do not have the answers but if we all take a bit on it we might get something good. Plus it's off season and I'm bored. 

* **Brans Power and the Power of the God's** - Many of you probably seperate the two but my thoughts on this that Bran is working through the God's as a means of communication, then being mistaken as an actual deity, here is a post I did before on it feel free to pick it apart like I've done to you lot https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8axrdc/spoilers_bran_stark_the_three_eyed_raven_and_the/ 

* **The First/Last battle** - OK we know that the last battle will be against either Cersei or The Night King. My thoughts on it are that The Night King has broken throught the wall, he may go to the Night's watch but I don't see the point in that, he won't care about 20 shitty warriors and I actually believe the NW will abandon the wall and head to alert Jon at Winterfell, we may have heard murmers of a battle but I don't want to be that guy but logically as I have been saying for a year the NK is heading to Winterfell and will be there quickly, the first battle will be against the army of the dead. Now that means they lose that battle or they win, they won't lose I don't think, but if they win then that leaves us with two options that A) The Night King is dead B) the loss was so bad that he had to retreat. So if he dies he dies and then it makes sense for whatever reason to go to war with Cersei. Let's discuss if he retreats, something very traumatic would have to happen for that guy to feel threatened into a retreat which I imagine is one of or a mix of 3 things which are Viserion being fully killed, huge losses, Bran hitting back at him. Maybe even all three. What do you guys think, will this be the first battle? Will the NK die? Will Jon or Dany? I for one think he will be made retreat and will show himself again at Kings Landing and take the million people there into his army. 

* **Euron/Theon** - I am convinced (on pure notion alone) that we will see a resolution to this in Essos. Theon has to get to Euron and presumably get past the GC, Daario is our only friend in Essos and I think they will hit a covert attack on the GC and Euron and they will never leave Essos. 

* **Valyrian Steel &amp; Lightbringer** - Ok we have 5 weapons left that are VS and they are with Arya, Jamie, Brienne, Jon, Sam there are also rumours of a certain PTWP carrying a dagger, a dagger that sounds very much like the one around Rhaegar's waist in the wedding scene but I am unclear weather it is VS or not. I am fascinated by the selection of heroes as I will call them who have the weapons and I do not think this is by accident. Maybe it's a sign that they are AA together (I don't believe that) or maybe it is by total chance, anyone got a good guess? I really do believe as you will see in my post about Bran that Bran handed Arya catspaw for a specific reason and that is to finish of the NK when the time comes, she has been trained as a master assassin and let go on Bran's command to Jaqen and she will kill the NK. Lightrbinger I don't know, perhaps it was melted down and formed into other weapons, perhaps it won't exist or as many of you think it might be Jon (I really hate the idea of Lightbringer being a person or mindset, or that we will have a last hero and AA a PTWP and a Lightbringer) but whatever we seen in those cave painting all I know is that Jamie Lannister has an important part to play but my money is on Jon to be our main ""hero"". 

* **King's Landing** - and by extension Cersei. Either the Night King will be dead by the time Jon get's to KL and a siege will happen, or else Cersei will take prisoners as some have speculated (I hope not because it would just be a forced Cleganebowl) but I have a feeling that Jon and co will be pushed from the North and go to KL out of necessity and may have to try and lay siege if Cersei won't allow them in and at that moment the WW will attack both armies. Leading to the streets filling with Wights and the city going boom boom. But then again that is all guesswork, any better? One thing I would love to see is a moment when Cersei realises that the NK is no joke and she has to face him or his armies, hell we might even see the Lannister forces move in on the survivors from Winterfell only to be taken by the NK and his army. Again all guesswork, but we are trying to put together a Jigsaw but we don't know what shape the pieces are. On a further note, will we have Cleganebowl? Who will set off the would be bomb? 

Jon's reveal, Who will sit atop the Iron Throne, who will rule, who will rule each kingdom, what is to become of the wall, who will marry who, who will die. All other questions you can answer now or if this post goes well I will attempt to make a proper post addressing those or any other topics and maybe we can get into a group discussion over all of this. Let's start with what I have so far, feel free to pick me apart and please try your best to answer and keep leaks under wraps.

Thanks

Looking at you Robb and Cat. 

Im not going to write too much more because nobody wants to read a wall of text. From season 1 to 7 though Ive been able to pick my favourite characters which have developed incredibly over each season. Arya, Sandor, Jaime, Tyrion, Bronn and of course the Targaryen siblings.

Really excited to watch the final season next year and Im hoping the recently announced prequels will be great too. I havent looked into it much so Im not sure what story they are focussing on there. I am personally hoping for them to focus on the Mad King and his dragons conquering Westeros. ",32,54,False,spoiler,,,,,

Lyrics from genius.com

[Verse 1]
They made up their minds, and they started packing
And left before the sun came up that day
An exit to eternal summer slacking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?
They drank up the wine and they got to talking
But now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down
They started walking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
And never get hungry, never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today

[Verse 2]
The children woke up, and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
And never get hungry, never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
And never get hungry, never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today

Since then, he has never been mentioned again or even referenced. Did they just give up on that part? Is there like a secret where Cersei was making that child up or something and he never existed? How does the witch play into all of that, when she said Cersei would have three children that would all die? Perhaps the witch was referring to how Cersei viewed her children, and maybe Cersei never saw that child as her own since it was Roberts or something?

Season 1 highlights. Dialogue... great individual duals between Mountain vs Hound, Ned vs Jamie... Drago getting hyped after the failed assassination attempt on his moon Daenerys and promising to invade Westeros and killl the men and rape the women... Arya being cute but already deadly ... Sansa really was detestable... and my gosh Joffrey was a cunt

I have an idea for a tattoo but am in need of a sketch for it. Attached is my attempt of a sketch which needs a few tweeks:

Obviously color. What Im aiming for is a rustic golden color all around on the gauntlet and on the outer metal ring &amp; sword and the infinity stones (gems) colored in order from the MCU. (Thumb\- Green, Pointer\- Purple, Middle\- Blue, Ring\- Red, Pinky\- Orange, Center\- Yellow) 

I also want to make sure the fingers are proportional to one another and are in a very similar shape to the original Game of Thrones Hand of the King Pin. Also the sword will need to be tucked in behind the pointer and middle fingers.

I chose to go with a celtic ring pattern for the surrounding circle, but would need help making it look like a golden metallic ring. 

If anyone feels up to the challenge of sketching this design, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you very much!

I've always loved sansa. Sure she was spoiled and naive at first, but that's b/c she's very young and was unable to know how to stand up for herself. She is not by any means cruel but still people hate her. Ned's death isn't her fault, she thought Joffrey would spare his life if he pleaded, she didn't fucking know he would behead him- I mean his own mother, Cersei, didn't even predict that!
Sansa has been tortured, beaten, raped and humiliated. And she has survived. She has grown stronger and become less naive. She may be a slow learner but damn it she learns.

So anyways R+L=J has been confirmed in the show and I believe it will be in the books (minus Jon's name being Aegon, I think it will be something else like Jaehearys or Aemon or hell maybe even Aerys) yes while I don't think R+L is the third book twist (In the sense that it was NOT something we would see coming) but I do think it will be the confirmed parentage in the books.

I don't think Ned and Ashara had a thing. Yes maybe Ned did have some feelings for Ashara but I don't think he ever acted on them nor do I think it led to the two having a child I think the whole rumors about Ned and Ashara being a thing is a red herring and I think it is made clear Jon is not Ned's child in the text. But that being said is it still possible Ashara fell in love with a Stark and had a child. Yes while I am not 100% certain I think it is possible Ashara may have had a child still but NOT with Ned, But instead perhaps with Brandon Stark Ned's older brother whom I believe is the one who slept with Ashara if this is the case (though another possibility I had that maybe Barristan Selmy is the true lover of Ashara Dayne but that theory is for another day).

However if it did lead to a child who do I think the child is? well I don't think it is Jon and also do not believe the child is Dany. So who could it be Edric? Gerold? Meera? Daario? Aegon/Young Griff? I believe if there was a child (and yes that is an IF) I believe it is a completely new character we have not met yet who could be introduced in the next book. Perhaps maybe he will turn up after the book version of the Battle of the Bastards with Howland Reed and reveal who he is, Maybe want to take one of his cousins hand in marriage (Arya or Sansa) or maybe take Alys Karstark's hand in marriage. However I don't think the show will do something like this since they will not have time to do this though it is possible...I say that very loosely by the way because we are reaching the final season (though who knows maybe it is the third book twist, not saying it is I am saying who knows).

Anyways do I think something like that will happen, I am not 100% on Ashara having a child with Brandon but I think it is possible.",5,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

You can win actual prizes (even just by taking part).

If you're checking this subreddit in the deep heart of the off-season, there's a fair chance you're quite a dedicated Thrones fan. And so, probably pretty knowledgeable.

We run a Trivia competition every second Saturday on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gameofthrones)  anywhere between 50-100 quickfire questions, from lore to completing quotes. [Here's an example of the chat](https://i.imgur.com/ZXZbVEx.png) (the bot deletes all replies after the correct answer is given).

Aaaand you can win prizes. Not every Trivia has prizes, but many do, including the next  the winner can pick a prize, and one random person who takes part too. [Here's a link to an image showing the selection.](https://i.imgur.com/ZXZbVEx.png)

Arya:  https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

Sansa &amp; Bran: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8nbg4u/spoilers_my_predictions_for_bran_sansa_in_season_8/

Jon &amp; Daenerys: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8o1pr5/spoilers_predictions_for_daenerys_targaryen_and/

House Lannister: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8q8pb1/spoilers_my_predictions_for_house_lannister_in/

But I short Arya and Gendry hook up, Bran and Sam go to Gods Eye, WF plotline from last season is retconed, Cersei sends Euron to surprise attack WF, and Jon rides Rhaegal. Okay now I will get into my actual predictions. Okay so I will be combining some of my ideas with most of the news I heard so far (and maybe just one Leak).

-	NK attacks WF not before attacking Bear Island, Last Hearth, and Karhold. Also Euron and the GC surprise attacks/sacks WF.
-	Also before hand Edd and his men were killed attacking AOTD after Eastwatch (I think he and the NW will die one way or another)
-	Mel uses her magic to fight off the undead and the NK.
-	Cersei has Miscarriage
-	Gendry forges Dragonglass and Valyrian steel (thanks to Sam telling him how)
-	Lives are lost in the first battle (Tormund, Ghost, Yohn Royce, Grey Worm, Bronn, Beric, and most of the Northern Lords), Beric gives Gendry kiss of life.
-	Yara gets forsaken treatment; Theon is forced to put Yara out of her misery after he finds her in her own Reek Persona.
-	Sansa, Varys, and Tyrion are kidnapped by Euron and taken to Cersei, conflict on both sides with Tyrions tongue getting cut out.
-	Jaime, The Hound, Brienne, and Pod are send on a mission to deal with Cersei, they run into Arya and Gendry who are on the same mission.
-	Arya gets the chance to kill Cersei but chooses family over vengeance letting Jaime get the kill.
-	Dany gives births to twins, Survives childbirth.
-	CLEGANEBOWL, the hound wins but dies not long after too bloodlose.
-	Dany and Drogon die fighting the NK and Viserion.
-	Bran at the Gods Eye reveals to Jon the reason the WWs returned and that Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP and Jon is Lightbringer.
-	Jaime and Brienne set off the wildfire under the Red Keep, Sacrificing themselves to kill the Wights that have entered the city. In Blackwater Bay Theon fights Euron and dies killing him, avenging his sister.
-	Jon and NK have one on one fight in the Gods Eye, Which ends with Jon and Sam holding him down and removing the Dragonglass from his chest killing him.
-	All Wights (including Viserion) collapse and WWs turn back to human form.
-	All three Dragons die.
-	Jon is chosen by the people to be the new king of the Seven Kingdoms, However he decides to break the wheel and melt down the Iron Throne starting a Proto-Democratic Government/Proto-Republic ending the Game of Thrones.
-	It is also decided there will no longer be one person ruling the seven kingdoms, and that there will be a ruler for each Kingdom ruling together.
-	Tyrion is made Lord of Casterly Rock, Sansa made Queen of the North, Robin is made Lord of the Vale though a new house is using him as a puppet leader under Sansas orders, New house rules Pyke, Edmure rules the Riverlands, A new Sand Snake rules Dorne, Sam rules Highgarden, and Bran leaves far North with the now turned human WWs
-	Either Arya sails more West with Gendry by her side or she marries Gendry and they become Lord and Lady of Stormlands.
-	Jon rules the Crownlands and raises his children and Ned raised him long ago.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

All the other Starks have big roles in the series but his was so underwhelming. He just followed Bran until he left for castle black, Tarly somehow made it there before him.

After spending two seasons wondering where he went, he came back but only in two scenes where he didnt speak and was killed. Im wondering if this is different in the books or just why they did this

I thought it was gonna be a similar length to the other books given the page count. I didn't realize until I started reading it that the spacing is MUCH smaller. There's many more lines per page than the other books and the text is fit so tightly together that I am having trouble getting a good flow going.

I know that is a weird question but what will it be, Sam reading to Little Sam and Jon and Danys child the story we just watch, A scene regarding the future of Westeros the children (NOT the children of the Forest but the children of the older generations)? Will it see all characters dead? Hopefully NOT that last one but what do you guys think? Personally I think it will be Sam reading the story to Little Sam and the child of Jon and Dany but I think it will be more then that. I think it will also focus on the future and changing the mistakes of the past (after the NK is defeated of course and I may make a separate post on how they are defeated), Basically in the words of a certain person who may or may not be from a separate franchise entirely Let the Past die. Kill it if you have too of course in the sense they would be fixing the mistakes of the older generations.

For example maybe if a child Is Illegitimate he will not longer be labelled a bastard and be treated with the same respect, care, and love as the legitimate children from now on, most of the marriages will be out of love and not arranged ones, and there will no longer be one person ruling a kingdom but each of the Seven Kingdoms is ruled by there own ruler, Oh and also a Proto-Democratic Government is established for each one maybe. Also I think it be cool (Only if both Jon AND Dany will die, which I dont think will happen I think Jon will live but Dany will die) if Jon and Dany die. Perhaps there child is raised by either Sam and Gilly (Jons best friend), Jaime and Brienne (the man sworn to protect Rhaegar raises Jon and Danys child), or Arya and Gendry (not only Jons favourite sibling/cousin but also it would be a Stark and a Baratheon raising a Targaryen, let that sink into your head.), Though I believe that Dany will die but Jon will live to raise his child or children.",32,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

The damning piece of evidence against Loras, is the reveal of a unique birthmark on his upper thigh.

Could Loras have not stated, that as his squire, Olyvar would have seen him naked or even near naked at some point.

Instead he lunges at Olyvar, damning himself. I know it was a highly emotional and intense moment, but the Tyrells are very witty in politics and persuasion. I feel they could have dealt with the inquest much better.

I have only seen the TV series, so maybe there is more information in the books, it just grinds on me slightly, how the Tyrells missed this opportunity to maybe save their only future of their house.

So when Dany reaches Dragonstone at the end of the episode and finally walks into her fortress, why are there still so many remnants of Targaryens - the two large dragon heads by the entrance, dragons as door handles, the Targaryen sigil on the floor of the throne room and the full dragons on the walls of the war room? Why did Stannis not erase all signs of their hated Targaryens from the halls he was granted by Robert when they won the war, since he would be holding it for life as the crown would always go to Robert's children? We see that Dany does pull down one of Stannis' 'flaming heart with a stag' banners, meaning the castle was still untouched since Stannis departed and also shows that Stannis did indeed put up banners of his house. Yet there are no signs of the lord of light or even plain Baratheons before the Red Priestess came to Stannis. Why would Stannis want to have the sigil of his enemy's house (and a presumed-dead-at-that-time dynasty) branded across the floor of his throne room/great hall?",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm a bit late to the party. Just started and got caught up with Game of Thrones over the last few weeks. I've just watched the hbo show and haven't read the books, so I don't know very much.

&amp;nbsp;


 I'm confused about why everyone seems to dislike Cersei's decision to betray Daenerys and Jon Snow (they seem to support Jaime's decision to leave Cersei)? It seems like this is Cersei's only reasonable option? If the white walkers didn't exist and the full brunt of Daenery's Targaryen's forces were coming towards Cersei, Cersei and the Lannister family would end up dying. Daenerys seems to be clear about wanting to break the wheel and doing that involves taking away the power the Lannister family had (effectively killing it...even if Daenerys doesn't take their lives). So, Cersei is dead anyways. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, doesn't her argument of staying out out of the truce give her the best odds of winning as 

&amp;nbsp;

1) either the white walkers win and they're all dead anyways 

or 

2) Daenerys wins with a much weaker force that the Lannisters have a much better chance against. 

&amp;nbsp;

That seems like much better odds of survival as opposed to joining forces with Daenerys and getting destroyed after the white walker fight (when Daenerys resumes her goal of breaking the wheel)

&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion, Cersei's decision is the result of foolishness by Daenerys and Tyrion. They should've realized it's in Cersei's best interest to let them wither and Tyrion should know Cersei views losing the game of thrones as death anyways.

1. Eddard Stark (Executed at King's Landing)

2. Catelyn Stark (Murdered at the Twins)

3. Robb Stark (Murdered at the Twins)

4. Rickon Stark (Murdered at Winterfell)

Yes, you read that correctly.  King Bobby B unwittingly has the touch of death.  Their fates were sealed since the first episode.  This certainly seems to be a happy coincidence more than a planned foreshadowing but I thought it was fun to spot.

P.S. The only other character he makes physical contact with was the wench sitting on his lap at the feast.  She may have died during the sack of Winterfell by the Boltons/Greyjoys but it's not confirmed.",6,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

I decided to submit my thoughts on the spin-off in hopes of reading some of yours', as well getting feedback on mine.

It is basically confirmed by George R.R. Martin, himself, that it takes place during The Long Night. Westeros, as we know it, was a much different place then and thats going to be an interesting world to see. To get a better idea of that world, I spend way too much time reading up on it. At that point there was only the First Men and the children of the forest, who eventually added the Others/White Walkers to the equation. Many of the royal houses of GOT did not exist yet. Now, I knew House Stark and House Greyjoy were of the First Men and likely would appear, but I wanted to get a more vivid picture. 

Via awoiaf, I got a better idea of the other families that were around during this time. ""While much of their culture was lost over the millennia, the people of the north retained the spirit of the First Men and many carry the blood of the First Men in their veins, including those of House Stark. South of the Neck there are people that still proudly claim the blood of the First Men, such as the Blackwoods and Brackens, the Daynes, the Redforts, the Royces, the Westerlings, and the people of Crackclaw Point...Beyond the Wall the Thenns consider themselves the last of the First Men."" Any thoughts on seeing these houses? I'm so fuckin' stoked for House Dayne in particular.

With a better idea of which houses (that we know of) that could have possible involvement in the plot, I was also interested to see if there was any additional information that could provide insight on what the plot would entail. Obviously, it will involve the rise of the others/white walkers. We are likely to see conflict arise with mankind and the CoTF, resulting in the creation of the WW, and chaos ensues. That being said, there is likely to be human vs human drama. Human drama is an important part of the series, so I questioned the political landscape of the time. 

I then discovered The Thousand Year War, which I expect to have importance in the upcoming show. With this war taking place around the time period that the season in works would take place, and with human conflict and politics being so essential to this universe, it just seemed to make sense to me that it would be included. There aren't many details on it, obviously, but awoiaf did provide enough information to pique my interest.

Here is what I could find out about it: The monarchs of the First Men were known as the Barrow Kings. Intriguingly, the name of the house is never given, although House Dustin is a known descendants of the family that was the Barrow Kings. Anyway, The Thousand Year War is what singers call the ancient fighting between the Barrow Kings and the Kings of Winter (House Stark). The wars ended when the last Barrow King submitted to Winterfell and gave his daughter to the Stark king to marry. 

My next train of thought revolved around the magic, another important aspect of the universe. It, like the human drama, is essential to the world. The question, though, is what scale the magic will be on in this spin-off. Obviously we will see the Children of the Forest and the Others/White Walkers. Giants, too, are probable to appear, I think. I'm also hoping we will get some direwolves, but who knows? In regards to the extent that we will see magic in this series, I think depends on how many seasons this particular spin-off will get. If we are going to get an anthology series, with each new season focusing on a different part of history in this world, I'm really not sure how much magic we will get. However, if the Long Night is going to get a few seasons, I think, like GOT, the magic will increase in time, starting on a smaller scale, but escalating has the story progresses. 

Anyway, those are my thoughts on what we could see in the spin-off, which I'm really excited for. I trust HBO not to fuck it up and to make something interesting. What are your thoughts? Who/what do you expect to see? 

Edit: I may be wrong, but I believe House Dondarrion, who the Baratheons are decedents of, were of the First Men. It would be pretty cool to meet House Dondarrion.",12,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

Lets clear that up a bit.

Incest is defined as a relationship between two persons commonly regarded as too closely related to marry.

As we all know, it is perfectly normal and common to wed first cousins.
Examples include; 
Tywin and Joanna Lannister 
Rickard and Lyarra Stark
even Jocelyn Baratheon and Aemon Targaryen.

The views regarding marriages between an uncle and a niece (or an aunt to a nephew in this case)  might differ between the Faith and the old gods. 
Although the High Septon protested against a possible marriage between Prince Maegor and his niece Rhaena, in the north, Serena Stark had been wed to her uncle, Edric, while her sister Sansa Stark had been wed to her uncle Jonnel Stark.

All in all, if they decide to be wed under the old gods, it's all fine and dandy.

What if this was the time the Night King had woken up, and maybe saw a vision (if he has the sight like Jojen) about this sick little baby, and that's where he came up the idea about taking babies for building an army or something. He then waits for them to grow up, so he can finally attack the Wildlings and the Night's Watch to gather some more army (wights).

But the White Walkers are clearly old, you'd ask? Well, what if they are the same age as Jon, it's just that their skins have worn out because they're undead like the wights.

Then the chain of events happenedMance Rayder saw the Night King took a baby, just like Jon Snow. Then Mance realized the babies have grown to be the White Walkers and have been attacking the Wildlings. So he left the Night's Watch, gathered every Wildlings clan for 10 years to keep them safe. And so on. And that's where the opening scene (Night's Watch ranger) started.

Also, Catelyn said, ""And I couldn't keep my promised."" This was definitely the moment Ned Stark didn't want to tell her the truth about Jon. Ned has promised his sister. But Cat couldn't kept hers. Jon Snow is truly the prince that was promised.

I don't really think this is a spoiler, because most people know that Game of Thrones takes place in a medieval world, or that there are ice zombies. Duh. Marked it anyways.

[SERIOUS THOUGHTS HERE] 
I think that at the end of Season 8/final chapters of DoS, someone is going to invent proper gunpowder. An alchemist or maester will create, I suppose. Considering that the era GRR based GOT on was directly followed with the spread of firearms, it makes sense in terms of Westeros history. ALSO, there is already a counterpart to 'Greek fire' in the GOT universe (Wildfire), so GRR hasn't written off explosives.

[JOKING STARTS HERE] 
And wouldn't you love to see/read that. Just imagine: everyone takes down the Others with Valyrian steel bullets, then live together in peace and prosperity. Then kill the dragons, replace them with eagles and rename Westeros to 'MERICA.

The wall has always been a joke for most people in Westeros  and has been manned, mostly, by criminals for as long as the show means to tell you.

Why didn't Mance hit the wall full force? He could have easily of taken it had he actually tried. Hell, he sent a group of men to their deaths just to test the defenses (I'm talking about Tormund and friends). It's not like he was seriously supporting that group from the other side. It was a suicide mission for them from the start. Mance saw the wall's defenses and pretty much tells Jon later that he knew he could take the wall (""you fired on us will everything you had. It wasn't much. Once I knew that, I sent 200 men to climb the wall""). Why did he retreat when he saw this? Why two separate battles when he knew that one would have won?

The point I'm trying to make is that, despite being a wildling for 30 (?) years, he should know that the wall is probably still undermanned. Even if he didn't, he learned that during the battle and should have actually attacked. Why didn't he? Did the book say something that the show did not?",11,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

I enjoyed both the character a lot but I don't understand why Tywin gets a pass for things Catelyn is attacked for.

I agree that Tywin is one of the best military strategist and is the biggest force behind the Lannister power. However, his treatment of his children is the biggest reason for the downfall. How does he turn a blind eye to the Jamie/Cersei affair? His abuse of Tyrion also got him killed. Tyrion was his child and his treatment of Tyrion was awful. Catelyn gets so much hate for Jon Snow, but I think other than a couple of instances, she wasn't awful to Jon. She was not a mother figure to him and ignored him for the most part, but she never stopped him from growing up with her kids. He received the same education, treatment and training as her kids. Tywin never gets that much hate for plotting to kill his own son. 

Catelyn has her positives and negatives, like every single character in the show. She makes some stupid decisions and some smart ones. I think the red wedding would have gone very differently if Robb has listened to her about not sending Theon to the iron islands. He wouldn't have sacked winterfell, Robb wouldn't have married Jeyne since Rickon and Bran wouldn't be dead (supposedly). Catelyn wouldn't have released Jamie if she believed Bran and Rickon were alive. Ramsey wouldn't have sacked Winterfell. 

 I feel like Tywin is constantly praised and his faults overlooked. He was a horrible father and cared only about the Lannister name. Catelyn gets a lot of hate for her treatment of Jon Snow, which I don't even think was particularly cruel. Her strengths and loyalty to her children and family are ignored.

In S04E02 ""The Lion and the Rose"", in the first 1/4th of the show, Tyrion and Varys are having a conversation. Varys informs Tyrion that Shae has been noticed by someone and that she has been reported to Cersei. Tyrion basically says to Varys ""she's my wife's handmaiden, make up some lie"" and Varys immediately and firmly denies this ""request"". They have a quiet yet heated exchange about the topic before Varys rushes off, but not before Varys bows as he begins to scurry away.

The fact that Varys and Tyrion were speaking off the main path on which they were initially walking, and were generally out of sight from anyone who wasn't specifically looking for them (all that to say they were basically alone), and Varys still bows speaks to his character quite a bit. All of his intrigue, all of his deception and manipulation, regardless of all of it, he still genuinely believes in the customs of the realm, which he so often claims to be in service of (I believe him). I also think it shows that despite what Varys does to Tyrion (not helping him with Shae, testifying against him), he still truly respects him (which I don't think was uncertain before, it just bolsters it).

I know it's stupid and inconsequential, but I just liked that they added that in. Any other character would have just trudged off after their disagreement, but Varys still showed his respect to someone he does in fact respect, despite everything. 

Are there any other small details like this one that have made you think better of the show?",1,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

Daenerys Targaryen, *Mother of Dragons*, will lay an egg.


**EVIDENCE:**

1.  Daenerys is a dragon.  She and Drogo had a stillborn sonRhaegowho was described as ""[. . .] scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat [. . .].  This could be explained by Rhaego having been a half-human half-dragon hybrid.

2.  Jon Snow is likely a dragon.  Since we have learned that he is actually Aegon Targaryen, son of Rhaegar Targeryenwho was believed to be the last dragon before Daeneryswe have no reason to suspect him of not being a dragon.

3.  Daenerys (dragon) and Jon Snow (dragon) consummated their friendship at the end of season 7.  And based on what I have read on the internet about sex, this means we will be getting more dragons soon.

4.  Since dragons obviously hatch from eggs, we should expect to see an interesting egg-laying scene from Daenerys in season 8.


**REASONABLE QUESTIONS:**

- Can Daenerys physically lay an egg?

Yes.  As you will see in the side-by-side comparison of Rhaego to a dragon egg ([Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/F1JHOmT.png)), they are approximately the same size.  Mechanically speaking, if she can lay a Rhaego, she can lay an Eggo.


- But I thought dragon eggs came from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai?

This is a figure of speech.  When used in this context, ""Shadow Lands and Asshai are Valyrian slang terms.  Eggs develops in the uterus, but during labor they are expelled by passing through the Shadow Lands (commonly referred to as the Cersei in Westeros).",27,249,False,spoiler,,,,,

Note that this theory is based more on narrative ideas rather than foreshadowing in the show.

Most stories have a protagonist and an antagonist, someone for us to root for and a rival for that person. GoT arguably has three primary protagonists; Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryan and Tyrion Lannister. Sansa, Arya and Bran Stark could also be considered protagonists but they support the main protagonists rather than drive the story themselves. What the show lacks is a primary antagonist; we have Cersai Lannister but shes not the primary villain of the story, we have the Night King who would be a better option but hes not really a character, more of a plot device.

The question is whether we need a true antagonist, someone who wants the opposite of our heroes and can be defeated in the final episode? A Song of Ice and Fire is famous for avoiding normal narrative ideas so perhaps there isnt one. However, I believe that every major storyline needs a purpose so George RR Martin has to be employing some normal narrative devices and I wouldnt be surprised if there was a major antagonist yet to be revealed, but who could it be? There is some foreshadowing that Daenerys will go mad king and become a villain but I have a sneaking suspicion that thats a fake out. Im putting my money on Jon Snow.

Is there any reasonable reason to think this? Heres my arguments for it:

Jons character is at odds with GRRMs approach to the story  Jon Snow is the only character in the show that resembles a traditional hero. Hes honourable, does his duty, protects the weak, is selfless and hes the secret rightful heir to the kingdom, hes basically a perfect fairy tale hero. GRRM doesnt believe in good and evil, his good characters are flawed and his bad characters are given relatable motivation. Jon Snow shouldnt exist in a Song of Ice and Fire.

Were waiting for a twist  what GRRM does like is turning a story on its head, the death of Ned Stark, the Red Wedding, Lyanna Stark willingly going with Rhaegar Targaryan rather than being kidnapped. We shouldnt be surprised if theres going to be at least one more major twist to come and what would be bigger than Jon Snow becoming the villain.

Plot points have to have consequence  two major events have happened to Jon Snow which havent had any real consequence on the story. The first and biggest is Jons death and resurrection. What was the point of that? It cant have been to simply give him a reason to quit as Lord Commander of the Nights watch. There is going to be a call back to his death, we just dont know what it will be. The second was Jon being left behind By Daenerys north of the wall, what was the point of that if he returned unharmed just a few hours later? Im pretty sure it wasnt just about explaining what happens to Benjen Stark. Did something else happen there that we dont know about yet?

The Lord of Lights Plan  were constantly told that the Red God brought Jon back from the dead for a reason, were meant to assume that Jon was brought back so he could fight the White Walkers and save the world from the Great Other. But what reason are we given for believing that Lord of Light wants the best for the people of Westeros? Hes a vicious god that demands sacrifices and encourages the use of magic to commit murder. I have little faith that he is an altruistic god and if hes not that doesnt bode well for Jon Snow.

It gives Aryas entire plot a purpose  This is a secondary theory but I think Arya will end up killing Jon Snow. Aryas plot is all about becoming a bad ass assassin and her story will be complete when she kills someone major. Who will that be? Cersai? that would be an underwhelming end to Aryas arc and its far more likely that Jamie will kill her. She was trained by the faceless men to be a servant of the Many-Faced God, we know the many faced god believes that deaths should be accounted for. Jon Snows resurrection means the many-faced god is owed a death and it would make sense that Aryas purpose is to balance that debt, for her to kill him shed have to have good reason and him becoming the series antagonist could be that reason.

So narratively I think theres good reason for Jon Snow to end up the villain but I wont claim to know how that might happen. Perhaps Melisandre can control him against his will, perhaps he drowned in the lake and the Night King resurrected him again and hes currently a slave of both the Lord of Light and the Great Other. Whatever does happen, If Jon Snow ends up being the antagonist and is killed by Arya remember you heard it here first :)

I've noticed similar comments in here as well. Can someone please point to me the source of that rumor?

From http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-7-running-times-revealed-record-length-season-finale-included/

&gt; Historically, the average episode ranges very little from season to season (from a low of 54:25 in season two to a high of 56:08 in season one), so its fair to claim this season leaps ahead with its 63 minutes average  that is, 8 minutes longer than the typical Game of Thrones episode. Though the longer episodes do not make up for the missing three, they do make up for one of them; this season may as well have eight episodes.

From https://winteriscoming.net/2018/01/12/will-season-8-episodes-be-super-sized-kit-harington-and-hbo-weigh-in/

&gt; We know we have six episodes  we are not sure whether they will run for 70 minutes or even 90 minutes

I feel like media played the telephone game with each other when Kit Harrington at a random interview casually dropped ""90 minutes."" People started calling it a full-length movie, then someone jumped from full-length movie to ""2 hours.""

Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, will give birth to a litter of direwolves.

**EVIDENCE:**

1. Daenerys cannot give birth to a human child. She had a stillborn son, Rhaego, who was described as, ""scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like wings of a bat."" Rhaego looked like a dragon but her children won't be dragons.

2. Jon is a Targaryen but looks like a Stark. The Stark seed must be stronger than Targaryen seed which is why Jon has Stark features instead of Targaryen ones. We now that brown hair must always win since Ned was able to find out that Cersei's children were not also Robert's because Baratheon also have strong seed. So it's likely Jon's children will be more Stark than Targaryen

3. Daenerys (dragon) and Jon Snow (wolf) had sex and the show seems to be pointing toward Jon impregnating Daenerys. This means that Jon will be fertilizing Daenerys eggs with his stronger than Targaryen Stark seed.

4. GRRM was going to title the last book A Time for Wolves. This points to the direwolves having a rebirth in the story. It's likely that all the direwolves found at the beginning of the story will die so Jon and Daenerys' probably have six direwolves at the end of season 8.

**REASONABLE QUESTIONS:**

* How do you know that there will be six?

Since we saw that the direwolf at the beginning of story had a litter of six direwolves, Daenerys will also have a litter of six direwolves to symbolize a rebirth. 

* What about Daenerys and Jon's Targaryen side?

The Targaryen (dragon) part of Jon and Daenerys' genes will cause Daenerys to lay eggs. She will lay six eggs and the eggs will hatch into a litter of direwolf pups. If Daenerys can lay a Rhaego, she can lay a Doggo [(Imgur).](https:imgur.com/kOcLZpZ)",2,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now I do think Cleganebowl will happen, I believe the Hound will fight the Mountain protecting Arya and will win and kill his brother via fire but at a great cost as not long after he will die from losing a huge amount of blood but before he does Arya and/or Sansa will be at his side telling him he will die a hero Sandor Clegane and NOT a Hound (Symbolisms galore I know), However this is like I said a counter theory if that does not happen and is somewhat inspired by Bridge4s vid on why Cleganebowl will NOT happen. So basically Cleganebowl is NOT an actual battle but more of a psychological one and that being of Sandor needed to forget the past and get rid of his hatered (especially for his brother, not saying he should forgive his brother but what I mean by is just forget his vengeful ways). 

Sandor has won that battle as he found a new family in the form of the Brotherhood, Tormund, and most likely the stark sisters, yes he is still a fighter but he has changed, and to fit more better with his arc he will die protecting Sansa from either a White Walker, the Night King, or Euron when/if he surprise attacks WF. Sansa would be near him as he dies and Sansa the Lady Bird will sing to him as he dies. But who will fight the Mountain you askwell Either Arya, Jaime and Brienne, or (in the coolest full circle act ever) Samwell Tarly (okay that last one is my own tinfoil idea but still).",30,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Specifically, Im talking about the bit of dialogue where Daenerys basically explains she cannot be the prince that was promised because shes not a man. Missandei explains that the noun prince in High Valyrian doesnt have a gender so its The Prince/Princess that was promised. 

This to me is just really poor writing. When Daenerys frees the Unsullied she explains to the master (who had been insulting her under the premise that she did not speak High Valyrian) that High Valyrian was her mother tongue. So it just doesnt make sense that she should be the one to have this explained to, from a logical or writing standpoint. 

I understand that this is a prophecy and idea the show wants to pursue, and I understand that it hasnt been fully flushed out in the show as well as it has in the books so they need to leave the breadcrumbs for non-book readers. But this is just so god damn lazy and the delivery of this scene was honestly clunky. 

An easy rewrite would be to have the scene play out almost the same way except have Tyrion be the stand-in for the audience who doesnt know High Valyrian. He has already displayed that his High Valyrian is novice at best. And then you could even have Daenerys explain it to him while side-eyeing Melisandre because shes realizing what shes saying to her. That she could be Princess that was promised. 

Or have it written almost any other way so that it conveys to the audience that: 
A. The show wants to pursue this plot line
B. It doesnt have to be a man 

Idk just my thoughts I guess. Let me know what you think. ",12,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe he does try to warg into people to change the past and continually fails like the mad king saying burn them all just like hodor does hold the door. I believe he also built the wall as well. Weather he actually becomes the night king though is where Im iffy 

I dont believe it stops there though. Bran eventually learns that going back in time by warging or taking physical form has drastic consequences he decides to take a more off hands approach. How does he do that?

He communicates to the past through flames sending messages about how to stop the white walkers. In other words hes the lord of light.",12,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Rhaegar is a Targaryen- there is no real indication that the Targs kept to any specific religion, what with their history of incest and dragon-lordship.  It is possible that as the royal family, they were polite about doing things for the Seven like the common people, but again, no indication that it was actually their belief.

So, when R &amp; L marry, why is the ceremony the hand fasting which seeks the blessing of the Seven?  Their officiant is not a Septon, it's a Maester.  The ceremony is in secret, so there is no judgment to be passed by the common people. 

My own theory is laziness. We've seen what a wedding looks like when the parties believe in the seven and we haven't seen a wedding for those who keep the old gods.  No creativity needed to reuse the ceremony and words we've already seen.  I find it a bit of a let down.",11,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I don't see any problem about this. There have always been quick time-jumps and fast ravens since the beginning.
S1E1 - Cersei/Jaime were in King's Landing, then the next few scenes, they're now in Winterfell.
S1E2 - Starks &amp; Lannisters were all in Winterfell at the start, then later, Snow and Tyrion are at the Wall, and the rest are in Riverlands (the Inn) at the end.
S1E3 - They arrived in King's Landing, then later, Catelyn arrived in King's Landing tooshe left before the last sequence of the previous episode.
S1E4 - Tyrion with Yoren arrived in Winterfell (left the Wall previously), then later met Catelyn at the Inn (Riverlands), who just left King's Landing previously.
S1E5 - Yoren reached King's Landing, Cat/Tyrion arrived at the Eyrie, and then Jaime received the news about Tyrion's kidnapping.
S1E6 - Robb received the raven's news about Ned fighting Jaime
S1E7 - Jorah, who was in Vaes Dothrak, received the King's pardon from Westeros (which was sent episode 5 or 6).
S1E8 - Ned is now in the dungeon. Cersei made Sansa write the letter, and the NEXT sceneRobb received Sansa's letter and send ravens to the bannermen. Next scene, Catelyn, at the Eyrie, received news about Ned in the dungeon. Later, all the bannermen are in Winterfell. Then the Starks left Winterfell. And then Cat, all the way from the Vale, met Robb at the battle camps in Riverlands (maybe). All in the one episode.

Time jumps and fast ravens have always been there. the difference was Season 1 had tons of characters to interject, whereas in Season 7, only two or three scenes can be intercut because of less fewer characters.",18,28,False,spoiler,,,,,

He believes that everything about the Age of Heroes and the Long night was built on a lie (or atleast was misinterpreted), and that the NK we see is really the Night's King/The Last hero/The 13th Lord Commander. The videos are pretty good and I would recommend watching all three before looking at my thoughts on it today:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Ve94lUvbw

Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEsWpQ1LrWE

Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdYcw99JxFc

Okay so I would recommend watching all three vids first before continuing to read this as I will be giving my thoughts on the theory and also give my interpretation on how I believe things played out if this theory turns out to be true (basically after I give my thoughts, I'll be giving you my version of the theory). So anyways what do I think of the theory? personally I actually kindof like it. Because for one it still fits with GRRM's Anti-War message and we know the ending will be atleast similar to the books (and I don't think D&amp;D would want to mess up the ending and the overall message of the story, atleast I hope not), It would be fitting that the NK like most characters on GOT is still a morally grey character (yes he killed a lot of people but still), and also I actually think it is a kindof cool idea, that his tale is somewhat a parallel to Jon's arc. But with a more screwed up fate.

So yeah if this was the case, i'd be content with it to be honest, Do I think the NK is the Night's King? Personally no as D&amp;D have stated there two different characters and also I still believe the NK is a Proto-Stargaryen (as in the first child of ice and fire, but that is a theory for another day), But this is kindof like my favorite counter theory if my Proto-Stargaryen theory ends up being false. But however there are problems with the NK=Night's king/Last Hero/13th Lord Commander theory, First up the timelines don't really add up (as I am pretty sure Bael the Bard (who is the NK's father in this theory) wasn't around during the Long Night (atleast I don't think he is). He also stats the guy we see get turned by the children is the Night's king and that makes straight up no sense since there is no snow on the ground.

You can argue the Long Night was not happening then and Bridge4 argues that the snow when away when the first long night ended and he was turned around the time the Andals arrive but that requires a huge stretch. Also in order for this theory to work in the show it would require a HUGE exposition dumb which I don't think is something we need with six episodes left, and on top of that being near the endgame. Meaning if this is true it would end up being a dumbed down/Simplified version of it (and no one wants to see that). That being said I still really like the theory and if it turns out the NK is the 13th Lord Commander AND the son of Bael the Bard that in my opinion would be very interesting.

Anyways now here it is, My version/interpretation of the NK=Night's king/Last Hero/13th Lord Commander by Bridge4.

So anyways if this turns out to be true I believe that the children and the Giants where living in peace but not only did the First men come around but also some early followers of TLOL (as there are buildings in Westeros such as the Iron Islands and the Citadel that resembles something from Essos) anyways the children create the Others in a attempt to not only fight off the first men but also the early followers of the Red God, but surprise surprise...that just makes things even worse. So the children create a pact with the First men to push back the early followers of the Red God and also Others, building the wall to keep out the WW's with the children also destroying the bridge between Dorne and Essos to keep out the Red God Followers and any other first men. 

At some point Bael the Bard (the bearded NK in the cave drawings and maybe the person we see get turned by the children in Bran's vision) sneaks into WF and takes a Stark girl with her, I am not going to say the entire Bael the Bard story because if you know about then you know how it goes. Anyways they were actually in love and The Stark girl had a child, This child was a bastard (like Jon) and left to the Wall where he fought off the Others and anything else that is a threat, He however at some point falls in love with a woman (either Dany Flint or a White Walker woman (who could be revealed to be his half-sister, paralleling Dany and Jon kindof)) and they get married and the 13th lord commander declares himself king. His brother Brandon the Breaker does not like this and yeah you know the rest.

Anyways Night's King with some other companions including his close friend the Last Hero go off beyond the wall but at some point they are captured by the others with the Andals coming they turn him into the new NK...The NK we see on the show.",6,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Not the humans, but what the Night King either does or doesn't do throughout it. Theories suggest he planned for the dragons to come north in order to seize one, but what happens doesn't seem to help his cause. Apologies if it's a bit messy.

**Option 1)** Night King attempts to lure a dragon north of the wall

*Problems:* if he wants the dragons to come, then he needs to keep the group alive in order to give Daenerys a reasons to stay long enough so he can kill one. If she saw that the group had been killed, she would likely leave before the NK could kill one. 

      However, the Walkers don't stop the Wights from attacking the group. They learn to attack because Clegane is throwing rocks on the ice, they learn they can go in small numbers to attack the group. What if they killed them before Daenerys arrived? Or was it just coincidence? 

        Yes, this issue assumes the Night King wouldn't be able to kill a dragon before she left, but why would she stay considering everyone has been killed by Wights? And seeing as the NK took his time getting a spear handed slowly by a Walker, it seems he may need a bit of time.

**Option 2)** he was unaware of the dragons/them coming north

*Problems:* if he didn't know, why did he just camp his army around the lake do nothing? If Daenerys didn't come and Clegane wasn't throwing rocks, they'd still be sitting there. They could probably survive a couple days as they were. 

           Was the NK A) going to wait for them to die of natural causes, or B) wait until the Wights become intelligent enough to cross the lake slowly? Neither seems in his best interest. He could've instructed the Wights to go slowly (unless he wasn't smart enough either...), used his ice magic/powers, or started lobbing spears at them for fun.

It seems really contrived, but maybe it's just down to bad writing/directing. Still was an enjoyable episode, but these (among other things) seems like a rather glaring issue.

On season one we were literally told by Tyrion Lannister on episode 1, that Jaime was the handsome brother and that Tyrion was the smart one. That of course, its not a lie, but I do think it was a way for books and show to deceives us, to overestimate Tyrions intelligence and underestimate Jaimes capability as a leader and as a judge of human character. Jaime was the one who told to Jory on S1 E4  how dangerous Theon seemed to be for House Stark and what a risk his was for the family, while Tyrion could only mock the way Theon talked about his masters. Jaime proved to be the one right since later Theon would betray House Stark and take Winterfell.

Saving the lives of innocent people and spare blood shed seems to be a constant on Jaimes live. He saved the life of millions of people in KL and instead of being made a hero, he became a disgraced man, and oathbreaker, a man without honor because only few knew the reason why he did what he did. 

Yet, Jaime still kept on trying to save lives during his life, in fact, it got my attention in my re watch that he did offer himself to fight Robb Stark in a man to man combat, in order to avoid the war between Starks and Lannisters. Thats exactly what Jon Snow did in season 6, but of course at the time we all thought he was a jackass to make such offer, because we knew it he was a great swordfighter and would of course beat Robb Stark, but he was trying to save the lives of thousands because thats one of the constants in Jaimes life. He is always trying to avoid more blood shed. 

When he was sent to Riverland to take back the Tullys castle he tried every way he could to avoid more deaths and more conflicts. First he tried to use diplomacy but when that didnt work he lied to Edmure Tully and told him he would kill his son, it was a drastic way, but it did avoid even more destruction and deaths in the Riverlands. I think thats one of the most important points of the books. A leader, a king, a ruler should always try to save their people and try other methods before war. George RRM is a anti war man, but he does believes that some war are necessary and unavoidable, BUT if there is chance for peace, it should be explored.

So, I believe George RRM has big plans for Jaime in the end of this story and will award him with a hppy ending for caring so much for the lives of the people in Westeros. 

I believe that Jaime will be Aegon Targaryen Hand of the King, I know many believe it will be Tyrion, but Tyrion was the man who brought the Mad Kings Daughter to Westeros and that I think it wont end well. Here are the clues that I got it from the show.

* S1E1 in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea.


* S1E1 When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. ""The Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people""

That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.

* S1E2 Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon's decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.

* When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King ""how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?

Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.


* S1E5 - in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

* S1E5 Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked. I think the show was giving us some hints about the end right in season 1.

* S1E7 - Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.

Jaime completely outsmarted Tyrion in season 7 using the mistakes he made in the past as a lesson. Jaime and Jon were literally the two leaders on season 7 trying to save their people from unecessary deaths. He went to Cersei to tells her that they couldnt win against Dragons, he wanted her to surrender to Dany to save the lives of his armies and his people; he decided to abandon her to go fight North and save the realm. He is finally becoming the man he is supposed to be. 

And that quote from Jon in season 7 also made me think of him and Jaime ""my father used to say, we find our true friends in the battlefield"". I think Jon and Jaime will forge a nice relationship in season 8 and Jon will need someone with experience in Kings Landing. Jaime lived his whole life in the capital and watched his father and Jon Arryn being hands of the king for decades. He will help Jon to be a better king.

Also, remember Jon and Tyrion were friends of summer; Jaime and Jon will become frinds during winter. **Summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever.**

I don't mean to say my interpretation was the correct one, but my reading and understanding of their interactions made actual sense.

Arya and Sansa have never gotten along since the beginning. She blamed her to what happened to Mycah (actual quote, SE1E3, ""You're a liar, and if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive""), just like she very much hated The Hound back then and wanted him dead. Except she had gotten to know Sandor Clegane throughout their journeys, and had grown to not hate him anymore (evidence: S5E6, when Jaqen and Arya played the Game of Faces).

The keywords here are the ""Game of Faces."" *Arya: ""I don't want to play this stupid game anymore."" Jaqen: ""We never stop playing."" SE5E6*

When they finally reunited, Arya was still cold and untrusting. But Sansa, who smiled when the guards told her about her sister, was more warm and excited. Their reunion was distant and met with brief silence and awkwardness (unlike Jon and Sansabecause Jon is more kind-hearted and forgiving, whereas Sansa finally felt safe), but despite that, Sansa was the one who came to her and hug her first. Arya didn't touch her on their first hug. But the second hug, after they talked again, was where Arya finally made peace. She finally hugged Sansa.

In the next scene, Arya and Bran talked about Arya's list of names she wanted to kill and the dagger that belonged to Littlefinger. Sansa's reaction about Arya's list gave her unease and discomfort (she knows Arya hated her before, so she was concerned if she was on her list). Then Sansa mentioned that Littlefinger wouldn't give the dagger if he didn't need something. This gave Arya suspicion about Littlefinger and his motive. (Remember, Arya didn't know anything about Littlefinger, only us viewers. She only met her at the tourney when he told Sansa the story about The Houndand at Harrenhal with Tywin.)

Next: Arya's sparring with Brienne. Sansa is looking down, observing her sister's remarkable skill and was slightly concerned (still wondering if she was on her little list), and Arya, after the spar, looking up, suspecting Littlefinger once again. 

Next episode (Eastwatch), Arya observed Sansa governing, then later asked her why she didn't defend Jon against the Lords who was complaining about his absence. Arya thought killing them would be more reasonable because they insult Jon, who is the King, while Sansa thought listening to their complaints is what being a good leader is. (Remember when Bran was ruling Winterfell and he didn't like the old guy talking about Robb, who was the King in the North. Arya had the same approach in terms of ruling with Bran, defend their own family.) Keep in mind, Sansa is more a politician than Arya, had learned the basics of governing through Cersei (Blackwater episode) and also the art of lyingthrough Littlefinger (Sansa's confession at the Eyrie). From here on, up to the Beyond the Wall episode, Arya wants to know everything, wants to know who is lying and who can be trusted. Arya, who doesn't know anything about ruling, who only knows about killing and death, who is serving the Many-Faced God, is now trying to test Sansa (and Littlefinger) about her (their) real motives.

Next scene: Arya is spying on Littlefinger. But he noticed her spying, so he tricked Arya, as Petyr Baelish is the master of this. I truly believe Littlefinger tricked Ayra. She doesn't know anything about Sansa and what happened to her since they got separated. Her last memory/meeting with her was when Sansa told their father she wanted to marry Joffrey (""Seven hells!""). She truly believed Sansa wrote that letter, but... now that she is a Faceless Man, she wanted to test Sansa if she's trustworthy and telling the truth. So she played ""The Game of Faces"" with her. That's right, the next episode (Beyond the Wall), the courtyard scene, she was already playing the Game of Faces with her. She told Sansa a story about shooting an arrow over and over, while Ned was looking on that same balcony. I think this story was true (she was a good archer, hit a bullseye in the very first episode while Bran was practicing), but then she inserted a statement that Sansa helped the Lannisters killed their father. Making Sansa replied, ""What?"" The exact same response by Arya when the Waif asked her if the story she told was the truth or a lie (Arya replied ""What?"" and the Waif just walked away because Arya couldn't tell yet what are the truth and lies of the story).

So they bickered back and forth. Sansa got annoyed and argued back. This become a heated argument. This made Sansa worried about her sister, a girl who has a list to kill. But for Arya, it's just a game. Then Littlefinger, who orchestrated this plan to make the sisters fight (like what he did to Catelyn and Lysa), came to Sansa after the fightor Sansa reached to him for some advise. Either way, they both talked about Arya. Littlefinger is always nosy. And this is where Littlefinger manipulates Sansa, telling her a Faceless Man is very dangerous.

Next scene, Sansa went to Arya's room to check up on her things where she found the faces. The weird faces made Sansa very afraid (that's why she quickly told Arya she has guards outside willing to protect her). But Arya had already tested Sansa in the previous scene. She knew Sansa was genuine to her but still afraid. She knew Sansa didn't betray their father. So she told her about ""The Game of Faces,"" and played the game once again (""We never stop playing"") to demonstrate and show Sansa that Arya, too, will never betray nor kill her own family. She told another story about she wanted to become the Lady of Winterfell (which is clearly a lie) while pretending to threaten her with the dagger. Sansa knew this statement was a lie, and that's why Arya handed the dagger to her because Arya lost the game. Arya explains that whoever caught a lie in their story would win. Giving the dagger also symbolizes she now trusts Sansa, and by telling her a lying statement about wanting to become the Lady of Winterfell, it also gives her a clue about Littlefinger's manipulationthat if ever Littlefinger mentions this statement to Sansa, she'd know he is lying.

Furthermore, Arya already knew the letter was a trickpurely based on Sansa's testimony about the letter earlier. (Also, Arya is still spying Littlefinger, the scenes where she follows Littlefinger didn't stop, she never stops spying, just like she never stops playing the Game of Faces.) The next episode, Littlefinger mentioned the lie again, and there Sansa realized Arya was genuine all along, that she will never betray her and her family.

And that's where the trial of Littlefinger begun. They now already know Littlefinger is a liar, who tricked them to fight one another, but they wanted to know more about it, and at this moment is where they thought about why Littlefinger gave the dagger to Bran, so they reached to Bran off-screen, and there they discovered more about Littlefinger's lies and treachery, and this is also why we see the dagger back into Arya's possession again. They met together to have Littlefinger be executed, for betraying their father that led him to death, but they wanted to trick him, just like how he tricked their father, so they called for a trial, a supposed Arya's trial, but really for Littlefinger.

Their scenes, interactions, and motives made sense to me. Their actions and arguments to each other made sense. And this is why I didn't have a problem with their story. And made the Littlefinger trial scene and the ending scene (""The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives"") even more emotional and impactful for me.",35,80,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's around 12 minutes into the second episode of the first season when  Jamie talks to Jon.  When they are talking together the camera specifically zooms in on their hands. Jamie uses his right hand to control and intimidate Jon when they are talking. I think the writers were making a statement about how much power and control his fighting hand gives to him in normal context. It's just another example of how meaningful his hand was to him and an example of the other advantages he had that he lost along with his hand.

I knew a lot of people would die, so none of the deaths susprised me. But it was worse an that. I though so many more people would die. People constantly compared this event to others events in works of fiction where a lot of people die. So I though I would experience a bloodbath. Instead only three people and one dog died. Dissapotment.

Also, all these deaths or for nothing more than for shock value. I'm not going to get invested in any of these characters if they keep killing them off for no reason.

Probably one of the worst episode of the show IMO. I think I'm officially done with this show. I'll go watch something with GOOD writing. :)",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

GrrM is now heavily involved (it seems more like he was in the early days of the GoT show) with Jane Goldman on a potential prequel that would delve heavily into the origins of the White Walkers. Could he address some of the changes and bring the two visions together? 

Based on how other adaptions have been made, the world GoT was originally produced in is much different than it is now in my opinion. Creators and ""universes"" adaptions are being made with increased attention to detail as they are noticing that this results in a better received product by analytical fanbases online. No one really deserves to have their vision be delivered in its purest form more than George RR Martin. So considering the WW were heavily changed and the prequel will feature the Long Night and their origins I think we could get a reconciliation from the origin in the books (when delivered) to the show.  

One last ""theory"" is that not only did the showrunners ""streamline"" the WW but I wonder if they left out some of GrrM final books twists from GoT final season. Will the prequel show have some of the surprise flashbacks the last two books may feature thus preserving some of the shocks from those books? Did they look at the narrative and come to the conclusion that some of the flashbacks in the last books that explain the Starks and WW were so epic they could be their own show and in pulling them out and making them a show that won't come out for years give him the time to finish his books with these surprises in them (hopefully)?

-- According to George R. R. Martin, the Others ""are strange, beautiful think, oh the Sidhe made of ice, something like that a different sort of life inhuman, elegant, dangerous.""[5] --

-- The blood of old Valyria is often manifested by eyes in shades of purple, and hair of silver-gold or platinum white. --

In many ways the Others are more like frozen Targs to me than zombie warriors. There is also the origin of the seduction of the Night King with the Night Queen which was omitted and I wonder why beyond ""streamlining"" which doesn't seem like enough of a reason. Much has been removed and replaced with the mysterious show Night King. Just wondering what others might be thinking of the Others changes...

This can be translated to many other aspects of life such as the order and chaos of society and reality. Peterson also talks about a cycle of metaphorically dying, and being reborn as something better. When a part of you dies, whatever that piece may be, your life is thrown into total chaos.

It's when nothing seems to be going right in your life, either you're aware of the catalyst or you're not, and your life is a living hell. This can be translated to many other aspects of life such as the order and chaos of society and reality. Peterson also talks about a cycle of metaphorically dying, and being reborn as something better. When a part of you dies, whatever that piece may be, your life is thrown into total chaos. If you can overcome this wave of darkness, then you will eventually be reborn as a better person, and there will be order in your life again. So how do you get from the seventh level of Order to the eighth level of Order? By climbing the ladder of chaos. ",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I remember somewhere in Season 1 she mentioned that Robert would never actually be present while she went into labour, so is it possible that she aborted Roberts child while he was away and staged the death of another newborn child to avoid suspicion from Robert? If so then the prophecy would still be completely accurate. Ive only watched GOT twice so correct me if Ive missed anything? ",10,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

At the start of the first book, how comes the Nights Watch was in such a bad state

Firstly, the kingdom has been through a period of relative peace, with a long summer. There should have been surpluses of money and men that could be sent to the wall.

Secondly, Ned had been ruler of the north for over a decade. He showed great respect for the Nights Watch. He would have known about their situation better than anyone as his brother was first ranger. Ned would have had the kings ear. Surely he would have had some influence with the king/other rulers in westeros. 

Thirdly, the kings hand had been jon arynn, a sensible hand who would have listened to requests from the Nights Watch/Ned

I would understand if there wasn't a lot of money to be sent north as king Robert spent a lot and may not have valued the Nights Watch, but surely they could have made a deal for prisoners to be sent north.

With Ned being such a respected ruler, and him holding the wall in such high regard, why did that not rub off on to other leaders, with them sending bastard sons off to live an honourable life. 

Sorry if this question is really obvious but I've always wondered. Thanks in advance!",13,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

To that end I thought I'd speculate about who's left running things when the dust settles.

Dorne - The only Dornish character alive in the show is Elaria Sand who should still be in a cell in King's Landing. Tyrion hates her for killing his neice but it might be good diplomacy to put her in charge.

Iron Islands - It's either Euron, Theon or Yara. Yara is the obvious choice but putting Theon in charge as a puppet of King's Landing would be more interesting politically.

The Reach - With the Tyrells wiped out it is likely that the Reach will be awarded to someone who's served our heroes with distinction. I'd really like it if Bron or Greyworm was given it.

The Westerlands - Cersai won't survive and i think Jamie will reject it, that leaves Tyrion to rule as Warden of the West.

Stormlands - Gendry will likely be legitimised and given the Stormlands.

The Vale - Robin Arryn is the only choice.

The Riverlands - Edmund Tully will be lord of the Riverlands.

The North - Almost certainly Sansa as Bran will be off being a Raven. It won't be Jon as he's a Targaryan not a Stark.

Lord Commander of the Night's Watch - Step forward Jamie Lannister who will take the Black after killing his sister.

The Iron Throne -  The big one, it's either Jon, Dany or their child. I don't think Jon will get it, I'd pay good money that he doesn't survive the show. I also wouldn't be surprised if Dany doesn't get it so my money is that their son will be in charge with Varys acting as Viceroy until the child comes of age. ",44,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well, it's so Daenerys and Jon could fight in Season 8.

Now that might sound really hypothetical, but think about this: in S7 Lyanna says Jon's name is Aegon. Now Aegon (Blackfyre) is the guy setup to clash with Dany in the 2nd Dance of the Dragons in the books. DnD renaming Jon is basically them showing their ""combining characters"" strategy to the fans.

And we should keep in mind that a Targaryen's arrival to the North will NOT go over smoothly...

BUT THE OTHERS!

Well that I leave up to you. The showrunnes cannot logically resolve the Others thanks to omitting stuff from the books. Supposing they try to get the same message across - which is the Others are only as good or bad as humans themselves, we could either see a peace deal or total death of both sides... which I don't think is likely considering the drama around the 'bittersweet ending'. The Others need to mate with humans to survive or per show cannon need human babies, so killing everyone does not make sense.

So expect some dragon on dragon action, just not the undead one and the big black one.

You can quite clearly see that all the dead are avoiding the broken pieces of the wall, is that because it would simply be hard for them to walk over or are the pieces of the wall still imbued by some of their original magic which can in turn be used against them ?

Now, I am probably going to get quite some hate, as most seem to be completely in love with that character. For me though, it's the opposite - I can barely stand her.

At first I thought her story was going to be interesting, but quite soon after Arya's leaving of King's Landing, her entire story has gone down like a rock, starting with Arya in Harrenhal, where she proves to be in many ways more competent than Tywin's commanders, who probably worked as  commanders for longer than Arya lived. Hardly even Arya's noble birth explains this.

Another thing is Arya's behaviour while travelling with Brotherhood with no Banners and with the Hound. In both times, Arya was acting like a rude, obnoxious, annoying brat, who also put Hound in danger several times. And despite that, everyone (including the Hound, who just got rid of another brat) treated her like a proper princess. And the thing is, that Arya was constantly in danger, as she was just a little girl. The smart way to act would be to keep her head down, be quiet and obedient, so she wouldn't draw attention, and act covertly. But she did the opposite of that. And despite all of this, everything went swimmingly for her.

Next comes Arya's time in The House of Black and White, where, despite Arya basically doing the exact opposite of what Jaqen tells her to, she still succeeds to become ""nobody"", at (probably) a record time, as well. At this point, I expected to see Arya fail, because, obviously, she could not let go of her past. And, I thought, her time with Jaqen would help her realize, that she is not ""nobody"", nor should she try to become that. But no, the show simply could not have Arya fail at anything. And thus, now Arya also has the massive Deus ex machina, that is the power of face-changing. Like, this convenient power can basically be used to get away with all kinds of nonsense, and, of course, it will be. Not to mention, that now Arya is even more God-like.

And now, after Arya comes back home, she's such a perfect warrior, that she defeats Brianne... Of Tarth... Two things about this:

\&gt; It's never really shown how exactly Arya acquires such swordsmanship skills. Syrio does not explain this, as even after his training, Arya was a noob.

\&gt; Regardless of training, Arya is still a little girl. There is no way in the world she would stand a chance against Armoured Brienne. It's like fighting an armoured giant for her. And she had a bloody short-sword of all things! Brienne would win 10 times out of 10, with Arya never landing a hit, if this was reality. 

I could accept it if Arya was an assassin type character, who avoided direct confrontation, because she knew she couldn't win. But this... This is ridiculous. I thought Game of Thrones was supposed to be realistic (excluding all the magic, dragons, etc.).",66,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

There is no way in the world it would ever pierce plate armour. If it did, what would be the point of armour? And indeed, Jorah contradicts himself immediately after:

&gt;""&lt;...&gt;Amour makes a man slow. It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.&lt;...&gt;"".

If a simple longsword could pierce plate armour (which we actually see multiple times in the show), it doesn't exactly ""help to keep a man alive"".

The one where she arrests Tyrion. It is widely regarded as the beginning of the end for House Stark and Catelyn is blamed for it because, according to a lot of fandom, she played right into Littlefinger's hands by making a stupid, impetuous decision with no regard for consequences. And even if House Stark had prevailed, people still blame her for all the death and destruction caused by the war because they see the consequences here as both necessary and foreseeable. 

Now, I've argued against this assessment quite a few point, but here I'd like to point out 3 major aspects in which the fans get it wrong. 3 things that people mostly take for granted, but where a deeper examination of the story reveals that the opposite is true. 


**Catelyn played right into Littlefinger's hands:** For some reason, quite a few people seem to believe that LF knew that Catelyn would arrest Tyrion and that's why he named him as the owner of the blade. This is completely incorrect. 

To begin with, Tyrion's arrest could've only happened in that specific set of circumstances - they had to meet at the Crossroads Inn surrounded by Tully bannermen and Tyrion had to recognize her. The chances of that were a million to one. Unless LF is a greenseer, he could not have known that this would happen. Catelyn herself showed absolutely no inclination to confront Tyrion before he recognized her. Had they simply passed each-other on the road, nothing would've happened. Its simply impossible that LF could've planned for this. 

But did Cat still play into his hands? Did LF catch a lucky break here? I'd argue the opposite. Baelish lied about the dagger - so its in his best interest that the Starks simply believe him but don't pursue the investigation any further. This chance meeting had the potential to unravel all his schemes. Had Ned not been wounded and Robert returned from the hunt, the truth about the dagger *would've* come to light and Baelish would be done. Catelyn meeting Tyrion was actually a very unlucky break for him - one that had to be counterbalanced with the lucky break of Robert's death. 


**Catelyn made an instinctive, impetuous choice based on her emotions:** Catelyn haters love to paint her as irrational, emotional and short-sighted and this action of hers is one they love to point to as an example. But was this decision really that irrational?

Consider how well she executes the arrest despite having no any time to plan it - securing her fathers' bannermen's overwhelming support to get it done without any bloodshed. These are not actions of an impetuous woman. 

And the arrest itself wasn't her first instinct. Look at these bits from the chapter:

&gt;Oh, gods, Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard around his forearm.

&gt;The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them

&gt;His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move awayand found Catelyn. He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. 

&gt;If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only

Clearly, Catelyn is trying to hide and avoid being recognized here. And for good reason. Ned is deep in Lannister territory and investigating them. It'd not serve at all for Lannisters to know that he is onto them - they might kill him like they killed Jon Arryn. Once Tyrion got back with the story of Cat's secret visit to King's Landing, the Lannisters would put it together and know that Ned was on to them. Remaining unknown was the best possible outcome here, but once Tyrion spotted her, that was no longer an option. 

She had to do some really quick thinking here. She could've fed Tyrion some story, but there was no story that would've made a lady of her station traveling incognito with only one old retainer any less suspicious. The conspiracy was going to come to light anyway - arresting Tyrion, however, forces it to come to light on her terms, not the Lannisters'. And now she has a hostage in case the Lannisters make a move against Ned. 

Given the short time she had to make this decision, I'd say she made quite a smart move. It was risky, yes, but doing nothing would've been even more risky. 


**Catelyn should've seen Tywin's response coming:** This is a pretty important one - was starting a war the appropriate and reasonable response to Tyrion's arrest? Was it a response to be expected of Tywin Lannister?

I've often argued that Tywin's action here were a major overreaction - and a very stupid one at that. Had Tywin responded pragmatically and with a level head, he'd have achieved a lot more while sacrificing a lot less. Had he gone to Robert for justice, Catelyn would've been forced to release Tyrion and the Starks would've been humiliated for making such a stupid mistake. Ned would've been likely dismissed as Hand with Tywin becoming his likely replacement. 

Starting a war on the other hand risked everything. Robert would not have simply overlooked breaking the king's peace and Tywin was in no position to face off against the power of the Iron Throne. Tywin certainly did not think his actions through and he got really lucky that Robert's convenient death allowed him to escape the consequences. 

But don't take my word for it - take Tyrion's. Here's the excerpt from his chapter when he languishes in the Sky Cells of Eyrie. 

&gt;He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard....

&gt;**If Cersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself.** Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that, not without impugning the honor of the king. And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial. Whatever murders they might lay at his door, the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he could see. **Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land. It would be the end of them. If only Cersei were clever enough to see that**

&gt;Tyrion Lannister sighed. **His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but her pride blinded her. She would see the insult in this, not the opportunity.** And Jaime was even worse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword.


Tyrion says nothing about what his father would do apart from sending riders after them, but his comments about the most pragmatic course of action here applies to Tywin as well. Despite being the one imprisoned, he sees that the smartest choice here is to have Robert sit judgment on the matter. He simply doesn't trust Jaime or Cersei to be smart enough to see that. 


But shouldn't Tywin be smarter? He is well known in the Seven Kingdoms to be pragmatic, cautious and cunning. So why would anyone expect him to be like Cersei - blinded by pride and seeing the insult, not the opportunity? Why would anyone expect him to react like Jaime - rushing to action without considering the consequences? Turns out, Tywin ended up being worse than either of them. But if Tyrion didn't expect this reaction from Tywin, why should Catelyn?


**TL;DR:** A more nuanced reading of the text shows that arresting Tyrion at the Crossroads was perhaps the smartest choice Catelyn could've made at the moment. It spiraled out of control partly because of unexpected actions by others and mostly because fate (GRRM) was conspiring against the Starks - but the blame for that cannot be laid at Catelyn's feet.

\- In the books, three Targaryen remain alive: Aegon (who's already landed in the seven kingdoms with the Golden Company), Jon and Danny. One female to lead and two man to help her. Exactly the opposite as the Aegon conquest.

\- In the series Aegon is not there. That's why the White King captured the dragon. That's why Jon is named Aegon (I belive he will be named something else in the books).

1868,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-6-30,2018,6,30,22,8v205a,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] A theory on Arya and Gendry,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8v205a/spoilers_a_theory_on_arya_and_gendry/,darrylthedudeWayne,1530366997,"So anyways today I wanted to give you all my full proof for why I believe if Arya ends up with anyone (yes that is an IF) it will be Gendry, Yes I believe that IF Arya ends up being with anyone I believe it will be the blacksmith Gendry. So lets get started:

-	Okay so first one of the interesting themes that people miss is that most of the romances in the Story (the Healthy Ones by the way) have always been between a highborn and a lowborn. Jon and Ygritte, Sam and Gilly, to some extent Tyrion and Shae, Robb and Talisa (sorry if I butchered the name (though yes I am aware her character is extremely different in the books)), and finally Tormund and the bear that ate his private area off that may or may not be Maege Mormont (though if it was Maege Mormont that will probably be a book only thing). You could also argue Lyanna is not as highborn compared to the man, the myth, the legend, Rhaegar Targaryen, Same Argument for Ned and Cat.Kindof (I say kindof because technically they are both from Highborn families even though Tullys arent really as big as a house as house Stark its hard to explain), And Arya is a highborn while Gendry is a lowborn. Arya has also lived amongst lowborns most of her life as well.
-	Also Arya is said to look like Lyanna
-	It was stated awhile ago I think that Gendry was brought back for a very important role, Now this will probably be forging Steel needed to fight the others and the wights but I think it could be for another reason, and that reason could be a possible romance with Arya.
-	In Season 3 Arya stats that she can be his family and Gendry replies no you would be my lady. Okay so this can be seen as evidence on its own but also if you bring in the fact that Maisie Williams (the actress who plays Arya) was told to say it as if she was telling Gendry she loves him.
-	Also fair to mention Arya had obviously checked out Gendry at Harrenhal when he had his shirt off (God I wish I had Abs like that) and also Apparently In the books Gendry watched Arya pee (or was it the other way around, I dont know if that is true though so if someone can confirm this would be grateful).
-	This come full circle with Roberts line in S1 that he had a son, Ned had a daughter, and they would join houses. Except rather then it being Sansa and Joffrey (Ugh, even saying his name makes me want to punch that little blonde brat in the face) it would be through Arya and Gendry.
-	Also if Jon ends up dying in battle and Dany dies in Childbirth (NOT saying that is there fates just saying out of example sake) then maybe Arya a Stark and Gendry a Baratheon could raise the targaryen children of Jon and Dany
-	Gendry would also be in my opinion a fair husband and let Arya be whom she wants to be and not be forced into the role of a lady
-	Also it come full circle with Robert betrothal to Lyanna.
-	Now you are probably wondering why I see Gendry as a better fit and not Jon, Well a few reasons actually, and before you start YES I am aware Gendry is a around the same age as Jon and all that other stuff in the books that implies Jonrya but let me explain my two wait no three things going against Jonrya. For one Jon and Arya grew up believing they were brother and sister meaning even if they were revealed to be cousins they would still not act on Incest, secondly There is nor real setup for Arya and Jon in the show, if there was more forshadowing to it I could see it being a possible thing. But they didnt, and finally isnt it alittle convenient that Jon is a Targ like his father and Arya is said to look like Lyanna.What I am trying to say is that the idea of Jon and Arya getting together is a red herring created by GRRM with all the parallels between it and Rhaegar and Lyanna and also the fact the GRRM himself scrapped the idea before making the final version of the series. It would make more sense story wise if Arya ended up with Gendry (IF she decides to hook up with anyone anyways)
-	Speaking of age we got to talk about the elephant in the room, The Age difference. Arya is much younger then Gendry though back then I dont really think it matter (well okay I can imagine there is a certain age were there too young to be married off back then but still though, Woman did get married at very young ages back then, NOT saying it was right but it was common), another thing is Arya in the show. Now I think they did not only age up Arya in the show (as she looks alittle older then her book counterpart and the actress who plays her is literally 21 years old) but also look at the way the present Arya in S7 when she whined out to spray with Brienne, the way it was shot kindof seemed like the person had a change in style (obviously because she is in actual fighting gear) but also the fact thatOkay is it me or is Arya starting to stand out alittle more, as in shes starting to look more pretty (I mean Hot Pie said it himself).
-	Yes the actor who plays Gendry has stated that he feels uncomfortable on the subject of Arya/Gendry hook up but A lot the actors probably had to play out uncomfortable scenes or scenes that made them uncomfortable. Also Maisie has stated she is a fan of the Arya and Gendry shipping
-	I feel there relationship would be very healthy and non-incestous. Also the fact they were friends the last they saw each other.
-	Ned stated that she would marry a king and rule his castle, in the show they change it too you will marry a High Lord and rule his castle though this could still mean Arya could marry the King (Gendry) and rule his castle, And in the show Arya could somehow become queen and marry the High Lord of Storms end (Gendry) and rule his castle.",4,3,False,spoiler,,,,,
