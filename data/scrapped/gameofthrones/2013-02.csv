But one thing I didnt notice until later is that the icons next to the cast names are accompanied by their characters' sigil (or a generic one if they dont have one, like GRRM and that ex-porn star who plays Shae). 

What irks me is that after putting all that detail into it, occasionally the sigils are wrong. Aidan Gillen has a mockingbird next to his name, a detail that from what I can remember, only gets touched on in AFFC, yet they mistakenly put a Direwolf next to Jack Gleeson? They could have put a stag OR lion and gotten it right. Just bothers me

My thinking on this is that Mance has killed Ramsay Snow and now is pretending to be him.

Think about it, he went with only him and 6 spearwives, which can hardly take back Winterfell no matter how sneaky they are. I'm sure that one of them would be able to get close to Ramsay and kill him.

We already know that Mance was helped by Melisandre to appear like Rattleshirt, so I'm thinking she can also make him look like Ramsay.

This makes sense because it prevents Roose Bolton from attacking further, it means that Mance can use Ramsay's position to turn the troops to Stannis side. 

So it limits the bloodshed, which helps Stannis war effort and also puts Mance, Stannis and the Wall in a good position with Roose and those in the North.

EDIT - Also, how would Ramsay figure out who Mance was? Rattleshirt was burned to death without the spell wearing off.",29,0,False,self,,,,,

They were more trueborn then them, joffrey and them,

I trusted Baelish to help in my defense,
But he betrayed me and now all I am is broken.

Remove my head right off my shoulders, act like it was nothing,
THey said theyd send me to the wall,
But joffrey is the king and had to act so tough.

Among my friends that's a pretty typical question, and throughout this subreddit I have seen some pretty amazing things such as people feeling so strongly about this question that they are even willing to get tattoos of house insignia and mottos.

So, what is it that draws you?  The house, it's logo, it's motto, the characters, the ideals?  

Do you ever change your mind, especially through the reading of the books?  Get to book four and five and say hey, maybe the Lannister's aren't what I thought they were?

Do you feel in anyway that your association has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, ie,  I feel like I'm in this house and now I do things that prove it because of that choice?",118,25,False,self,,,,,

Here, where I live, each book is divided into 2 parts, so there is A Storm of Swords as the part 1 and The Glory of the Traitors as part 2, this is for ASOS.
Now, I'm not an avid reader, and I don't think I'd like reading the first books, as I already know most of what happens, and I'm thinking about reading ASOS Part 1 before Season 3 starts. I'm mostly worried about the surprise factor being reduced in the show, so this is an experience,  if I like it, I'll keep reading.

Do you think that's good enough? Or are there any background stories from the first books hidden from the show that I really need to know? Mind you, here I'd have to buy 4 books, priced at 20 euros. So, yeah.

You already know this, but please no spoilers.

(Season 1 spoiler)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/17txo2/a_huge_a_song_of_ice_and_fire_theory_season_1/,[deleted],1359931745,"   I'm sure many people have thought there must be a deeper meaning to the title ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" because George R.R. Martin is all about going deep into his story. Here is the most logical, crazy, happy yet sad endings that I can come up with...
   The series is named ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". To put it simply, I'm thinking, John Snow being ice, Daenerys Targaryan being fire. These two are a relatively similar age and this is what I propose; when winter has come and almost all hope is lost, Daenerys swoops over with her dragons and teams up with John Snow to eliminate the white walkers. Now, songs can often be defined as love stories. I'm thinking this, and with it in mind, John and Daenerys get together. Now, an age of peace sweeps over Westeros, but so many amazing characters die that its no hollywood happy ever after bullshit.
   All great series need a good end, all amazing ones need an ending to drop jaws. I couldn't think of another way that George could knock his work straight up to the top series of all time than to finish like this. But we know he has many surprises. Yet this theory is so far fetched that it would still be a huge surprise to the majority of his readers. 

tl;dr  ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is named that way because Jon Snow(ice) and Daenerys Targaryan(fire) get together at the end and the dragons save the world.

I couldn't help but think maybe GRRM got a little inspiration from him for Tyrion.

&gt; 
Polydore Vergil and Thomas More expanded on this portrayal, emphasising Richard's outward physical deformities as a sign of his inwardly twisted mind. More describes him as ""little of stature, ill-featured of limbs, crook-backed ... hard-favoured of visage.""[56] Vergil also says he was ""deformed of body ... one shoulder higher than the right"".[56] Both emphasise that Richard was devious and flattering, while planning the downfall of both his enemies and supposed friends. Richard's good qualities were his cleverness and bravery. All these characteristics are repeated by Shakespeare, who also adds to Richard's deformity to include a hunch, a limp and a withered arm.  Richard's reputation as a promoter of legal fairness persisted, however. William Camden in his Remains Concerning Britain (1605) states that Richard, ""albeit he lived wickedly, made good laws"".[59] Francis Bacon also states that he was ""a good lawmaker for the ease and solace of the common people.""[60] The first attempt to defend Richard completely was made by George Buck, a descendant of one of the king's supporters, whose life of Richard was completed in 1619. Buck attacked the ""improbable imputations and strange and spiteful scandals"" related by Tudor writers, including the alleged deformities and murders. He located lost archival material, including the Titulus Regius, and claimed to have seen a love letter written to Richard by Elizabeth of York. The book was published in 1646.""",31,41,False,self,,,,,

We know that Ian McElhinney is returning in season 3 as Barristain Selmy, but my question is how much will his portrayal be changed from the books... 

As readers know Selmy returns in secret in aCoK under the alias ""Whitebeard"" as an elderly squire to Strong Belwas.  He serves Dany for a time as Whitebeard before he reveals himself as Barristan Selmy during ASOS, after he saves her life from the Titan's Bastard.... It was a great reveal I the books and a shock to the reader that Barristain the Bold is now in the Company of Dany...

My question is, how is the show going to handle the ""Whitebeard""/secret identity plot line?  The secret identity plot works in print because the books are a non visual medium and there were very little clues to his identity to be picked up.  On the show however viewers are going to be able to pick up that it's the same actor and draw out the answer the moment appears on screen.  So will HBO keep the plot line at all?  

Mero has been cast, but Strong Belwas has not, so that leads me to think the Whitebeard plot might be dropped entirely...  This leads to another problem though, Whitebeard is with Dany for a while before he reveals himself, if you drop the Secret identity plot entirely you also have to by extension expose Jorah as Robert's informer way too early, as well as the reason why Barristain was in disguise for so long. (Getting a gauge of Dany's sanity). 

I would hate to see the Whitebeard plot go, but I think they'll just wind up keeping it in, but viewers will just know the truth of his identity, and the characters on screen won't.  It's a bummer that show only viewers won't get the surprise of his reveal later on, but them's the bricks. I just hope they keep it in, but if so I also how they will rework the plot line without Strong Belwas?",71,69,False,self,,,,,

As we approach the new season, there is something I wanted to mention.  Spoiler policy is a big issue here, with a series so full of twists and turns and surprises...those of us who have an idea of what's coming (minus the changes and alterations the new medium surprise even *us* with) want people who haven't yet or don't intend to read the books to be able to enjoy HBO's rendition without spoilers.  That's a good thing.  However, I became very irritated last year by some readers who seem less interested in allowing non-readers their own fandom of the series; who instead want to recreate their own, and live vicariously through the uninitiated.  Some people are trying to force their own experiences onto new viewers, and have blatantly *lied*, as if they now consider themselves co-authors with Martin to manipulate the experience.



Specifically I am talking about the deaths of Bran and Rickon last year.  Now, lots of people were surprised by that when it happened in the books, and plenty were surprised by the show.  MANY, though, were not duped; this is not meant as any sort of insult to those who did believe them dead.  Plenty of times the series has fooled me, tricked me, surprised me...plenty of times I didn't realize what had happened until I actually came online and saw some post and went ""OH!""  However, this wasn't one of those times.  Many readers saw Theon's thoughts as the bodies were revealed re: both the other children and how the tar disguised the heads so that they could be anybody, and combined with the fact that Bran at least clearly had more story to be told, never believed the children were dead; knew all along they were decoys and that this was still a sin by Theon, a horrible crime, but not one that resulted in Stark death.



The show put plenty of clues itself.  They set up the other kids running around, and plenty of non-readers during the post-episode discussion noticed those other kids and made the connection; they, in their own experience of the series, looking at clues (like we all due), deduced a theory about what had happened.  Some non-readers suspected Bran and Rickon lived.  And then readers began blatantly lying.  ""No, they're really dead.""  The fun non-reader video reviewer at OtakuAssemble! himself was duped by a friend; convinced that he had simply misunderstood a clearly stated fact of the series.  Readers began convincing non-readers they were watching the series *wrong*, just to get them to be surprised at something that wasn't necessarily a surprise for all of us.



I think that some readers are too focused on their own experiences of ASOIAF and are less willing to allow new viewers to have their own, especially if they might not have the same enjoyable ""surprises"" or, seven forbid, might have actually deduced something *before* a reader had in their own experience.  Some readers were distraught, in season 1, that the show made overt that Illyrio and Varys were talking in the Red Keep, despite the fact that the clues were there in the books and plenty of readers figured it out even as it was happening (even though Arya did not, and could not; unlike the reader, she hadn't *met* Illyrio with his distinctive forked yellow beard).  Now I am seeing discussion about Arstan Whitebeard.  Arstan Whitebeard.  ARSTAN.  The not-too-different alias of bARiSTAN Selmy.  Again, I and other readers figured it was Selmy from the moment he arrived.  If you did not, that's fine.  It was not clearly stated; there were certainly clues.  The fact that he took a relatives name as an alias that was only his own minus 3 letters, the fact that Selmy was a character bound to return and had been gone for a while and now suddenly a badass and chilvalrous white haired character arrives.  There were clues that led many of us to realize who it was, and the ""surprise"" some of you felt was not necessary to the story as many of us never had it.  It is only important to the drama that *Dany* is surprised, and seeing as how she has never met Bold Barry she will be.  HBO has no *reason* to try to hide the actor, and if some viewers are surprised and others penetrate the disguise of the beard, then so be it (just as some viewers thought Bran and Rickon were dead *without* the lying of readers, and some deduced they weren't from clues, and how some of us readers deduce things from hints and others do not).



The point is, we are all going to have our own personal and unique experiences of this series.  I was spoiled on Eddard's death and shocked by the Red Wedding.  Plenty did not have Ned's death spoiled, or perhaps saw it coming.  Some were surprised by this or that or the other.  I remember reading a reaction where someone wasn't surprised by Ned's death because she thought he had died earlier:  she had misread the line about Littlefinger putting a dagger to Ned's throat during the goldcloak betrayal and thought it meant Baelish had killed Ned.  Having already had that shock, when it really happened she was less surprised.  


**TL;DR**:  We all have our own experiences of the series, so I ask other readers:  along with not spoiling non-readers, try not to *force your own experience* onto them by blatantly lying about what they saw and dismissing their own personal interpretations.",16,32,False,self,,,,,

In a little over two weeks I'm headed down to Pennsylvania State (I'm in Ontario) with my school to attend Penn State's Model UN event, which this year, to my surprise and delight, features a Game of Thrones crisis committee!  After some fierce inter-delegation competition I have received the position of Lord Grandison of the Stormlands for the committee.  I'm super excited, and I want to make the conference as awesome as possible - so I've decided to go in costume.  But I have no idea how to do that.

House Grandison isn't a particularly famous house.  Harlan Grandison was the Kingsguard member who died in his sleep and Jaime replaced in 280AL.  Lord Grandison, whom I am, began Robert's Rebellion as a Targaryen loyalist, but joined Robert's side after being defeated at the Battle of Summerhall.  He travelled with Robert to the Battle of the Trident, where he was wounded and died one year later.  Their symbol is a sleeping black lion on a yellow field, and their words are Rouse Me Not, though this is only semi-canon.  Though there are a few other references to the house, the committee takes place during Robert's Rebellion, so this is pretty much all I have to go on.

So I'm looking for a medieval, probably late 1400s, costume.  I can't really do this myself for a few reasons.  Firstly, we don't see much of the Stormlands in the show or books, so I've got little to go on as far as their fashions go.  Most of the premade fantasy/medieval costumes are for knights or queens are are generally pretty terrible.  I don't intend to show up in armour, either - this is a diplomatic council simulation, after all.  And most importantly I'm absolutely useless as far as clothing and costuming goes in general.

Though I normally lurk /r/asoiaf over this board, I remember seeing all the lovely costumes people made for Halloween and I thinking ""hey, I should get in on that"".  So I figured I'd ask all of you for some costuming advice.  Anything you could offer - even insights on where to look - would be really appreciated.",6,13,False,self,,,,,

During the Tourney at Harrenhal, Rhaegar supposedly kidnapped Lyanna and took her to the Tower of Joy for safekeeping during Robert's Rebellion. Although Robert insists he stole and raped her, Barristan Selmy insists in ADWD that ""Prince Rhaegar loved his Lady Lyanna"" which is apparent since he honoured her after the winning the tournament instead of Elia, his wife. So perhaps she wasn't kidnapped after all and merely eloped with Rhaegar to Dorne where she had his child; Jon. The next time we hear of Lyanna is when Eddard arrives to rescue her only to find her protected by the three *greatest* knights of the Kingsguard. Why were they not at the decisive Battle of the Trident but instead guarding a tower if not for an even more important reason; Rhaegar's secret heir. Eddard finds Lyanna dying in a bed of blood. Is it possible that it was the childbirth that killed her? No other reason is ever provided. Eddard promises her something and returns to Winterfell with the babe Jon.

Now, why do we assume that AA reborn only referrs to *one* person? Isn't it possible that he is reborn in the form of more than one? We know that the dragon has three heads, that probably referrs to Dany, Aegon and Jon who are all candidates for being AA reborn. All of them fulfill parts of the prophecy, yet no one fulfills every part. Maybe only the three of them together are AA...

And maybe Lightbringer isn't taken to be literally, since the oath of the Night's watch is 

&gt; I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn

Lightbringer would definitely be the same. And provided that AA needs lightbringer to defeat the others, D+J+A (Dany, Jon, Aegon) need the night's watch to do the same.

Our technology is leaps and bounds more developed than theirs, and we got there in less than half the time. 

While having an 8000-year history makes Westeros seem like it has layers and layers of epic history...assuming, of course, that the Wall wasn't built by neanderthals (or however they might have evolved in the GRRMiverse), has it occurred to anybody else how utterly and improbably slowly advances are made in Westerosi technology?

I'm writing this post tonight because I'm concerned the warning fell on deaf ears.  There is still a lot of careless spoiler posting, and it does seem to be increasing.  I wish it were just more trolls; they're easy to spot and deal with.  But instead it's mostly been people who don't seem to care about warning at all.  

* If you are posting from a mobile phone and have trouble adding a spoiler tag, don't post spoilers.  Posting from a phone is not an excuse for leaving open spoilers for others to stumble on.
* Don't use vague spoiler labels that cause people to mistake the scope of your tag.  At least name the book or episode you're talking about.  
* Lazy and/or intentional mis-coloring of tags doesn't fly.  It used to be just people using the default black for every type, but lately the tagging is all over the place.  
* And there is definitely an increase in blatant ASOS spoilers posted with no warning at all.  We've already warned multiple times about how insta-ban that is.

Please, take 5 minutes to read over the [Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/thrle/posting_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) and [Spoiler Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/iamws/spoiler_guide_for_rgameofthrones/).  Spoilers are not allowed in titles or thumbnails.  Don't use the NSFW mark unless your post is NSFW; people actually risk spoilers to see what was NSFW (and are even more upset when they find it was only spoilers).  Good warnings are not optional, and anyone that seems to be a real spoiler risk is banned.  We don't want to ban you, so please be careful with your posts.

*""Under the sea the mermen feast on starfish soup, and all the serving men are crabs. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."" Patchface, Lord Stannis' Fool*
 
In 298 AL following the death of King Robert I Baratheon, the Seven Kingdoms fell into complete disarray due to the ensuing sucession crisis. This period was referred to as simply, ""the Bloodletting.""
 
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, not trusting Lord Balon of the Iron Islands his progeny, sent the hostage Theon Greyjoy to the dungeons of the Dreadfort under Lord Roose Bolton. Theon was interrogated about his knowedge of the Ironmen's plan's, and ultimately lost his feet, hands, and several teeth in the process. The torture of the Young Kraken was discovered by Lord Mace Tyrell after recieving a raven that was meant for the Dreadfort. A war ensued between the North and the Iron Islands, the costlier battes fought for Moat Cailin, which changed hands frequently. The Stark armies were led by Eddard Stark and Roose Bolton, leaving Theon in the tender care of Ramsay Bolton, a newly raised bastard. Thousands died on both sides. 
 
Lord Tyrell, also fearful of the instability in the Seven Kingdoms and believing Stark's accusation that King Joffrey was a bastard born of incest, sucessfully won a series campaigns against Lord Tywin Lannister, securing Highgarden as well as the Reach. The Lannisters were forced to retreat to Casterly Rock. Thousands died on both sides.
 
Lord Stannis Baratheon, feeling that he was the true heir of Robert, gathered his banners at Dragonstone and invaded mainland Westeros en force. He siezed Storms End and most of the eastern shore, and ousted the Lannisters from King's Landing, claiming the Throne.
 
The Lords and Ladies of the Great Houses of Westeros feared the awesome display of military might on the part of King Stannis I Baratheon, and feared that he would use his now-idle armies to expand and attain further holdings for himself. Said Houses ceased all fighting and united as the Coalition of the Six Kingdoms, and slaughtered Stannis' troops by the tens of thousands. House Stark returned Theon to Pyke with Sansa as a hostage of the Ironborn as a sign of trust.
 
King Stannis was ousted from King's Landing by Lord Mace Tyrell, who crowned himself King Mace I Tyrell, and sat the Iron Throne. Lord Stannis fled to Dragonstone. He put Melissandre to the sword in his rage, and embraced the Drowned God.
 
King Mace was then betrayed by the Dornish; Prince Doran could not quell the cries for Tyrell blood on the part of the Dornishmen and suffered from debilitating creativity. Thieves in court stole the Iron Throne, loaded it onto a wagon, and transport it to Sunspear. A new throne was crafted for King Mace from the bones of fallen Baratheon and Martell troops, called the Throne of Skulls. King Mace sent an urgent message to Lord Eddard Stark in Winterfell, asking the Starks to send him a Hand to seal their alliance. Lord Eddard, waging a new honor war against the Ironborn and growing tired of King Mace's demands, sent Hodor in a necklace made of golden hands, with a note reading, ""A hand fitting for the Second Fat King of the Seven Kingdoms."" 
 
Lord Eddard, feeling that the war against the Greyjoys was all but won, sent a contingent of troops by sea from Winterfell to Dragonstone, conquering it easily. Lord Stannis and his retinue were stripped of their titles and sent to the Wall to take the black. The Onion Knight was put to the sword.
 
Lord Reaper Balon Greyjoy, seeing an opportunity to bathe House Greyjoy in glory, initated a gambit to swallow the holdings of Houses Stark and Lannister on his borders. Winterfell and every major castle in the North was put to the torch, and Balon crowned himself King. The Starks fled by ship to Dragonstone, and have not been heard from since. Many have entered the castle, but none of returned. 
 
Lady Sansa Stark lept from a bridge on Pyke to avoid being shamed by the Ironmen.
 
Lord Tywin died peacefully of old age, and the Rock was passed to Tyrion, as Jamie had died in battle by the hand of the Knight of Flowers.
 
Prince Doran returned the Iron Throne to King's Landing in exchange for a truce with King Mace, and the bloodshed ended for a time.
 
King Mace went mad with rage after Balon's crowning. A letter was recieved at the Wall from King's Landing. It depicted a surpassingly crude drawing of the Hand and the King, and a letter reading:
 
*""Hodor Hodor,*

*Hodor Hodor, Hodor Hodor Hodor.*
 
*Hodor,*
 
*Hodor.""*
 
The Hand's head was later reported to be seen hanging above the Gates of the Gods at King's Landing.
 
Lord Stannis Baratheon fell through a patch of thin ice while on a ranging and died of drowning, with no heirs.

However, I don't think it's the easiest thing for viewers who haven't read the books to pick up on. I wish the show would film and air the Tower of Joy scene referred to in the first book. It would make an excellent opening scene for one of the upcoming seasons and also give fans the chance to see Ned in action again, in what could be an epic fight if filmed properly (Ned and 6 of his best bannermen against the three best knights in the kingsguard!). It would also draw viewers into the deeper mystery surrounding Jon Snow, which is one of my favorite elements of the ASOIAF series.

I don't think it would be out of place to add this flashback into one of the seasons.

Planting trees up and down the Rocky mountains of British Columbia. I was forced to leave the company where all my friends worked and go to a new one. There I was alone and working with a horrible band of roughians. This is when I listened to the audio books. A game of thrones to a dance with dragons in one month. This was my comfort. 


* Being a forester with a great beard and rough hands I felt like I **became** Jamie Lanister in captive. My love was elsewhere, my arena at another place, surrounded by people who hated me. I quickly became engulfed in the world. Fully captured and living in the fantasy. Roy Dotrice was my narrator. So well voiced that characters did not need to be introduced. I was there. I knew who was speaking through him. I felt the cold of wall, the warmth of the hearth, the dryness of the desert, the scourging of dragons, the salt of the sea, and the stink of kings landing. And the pain, oh the pain of love and loss. Never have I been so enthralled by a fantasy. The love was mine. The lust was mine. The hate, fear, loss, and pain all more real to me then the tree in my hand. In reality I was alone working as hard as I could physically exhausting myself. Sacrificing my summer so I could go to university in the fall and be with my love. Eating like a king, Sleeping like a babe, Working at a trade I do best, but no songs of glory. No joy shared in this world. Just dark depression. I am thankful for my physical being to be so drained that my mind was free to give itself to Westeros and Essos.
 
Tyrion my little brother had a hard life. Mine was simple. I am a sword. I am justice. I am the best at what I do. I know my craft and I have trained my whole life to become so. I feel my emotions and act accordingly. I am action, not thought.  My brother's life was different. His role undiscovered to others. He has had to fight for his. A different method than I could understand. I always loved and will love him. I have compassion for him. The only thing in this world I can say that about. I have tried to make his life happier. I sadly have failed more times than succeeded. Through the mystery of this world I heard a song. Sung by a bard in King's landing. 

*""He rode through the streets of the city,
down from his hill on high,
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles,
he rode to a woman's sigh.
For she was his secret treasure,
she was his shame and his bliss.
And a chain and a keep are nothing,
compared to a woman's kiss""*

Love. Making hands of gold love. This is what it was about to me. My brother took the song differently. Fear and anger is what he felt. The song changed after that. It has become a memory linked to the past. Its the memory that haunts him. Whereever he is now I am sure he is haunted by it. Echoing in his disfigured ears. I wept and could no longer work. In my great beard and muddy hands. I could no longer plant trees. I just sat on a stump in the clear cut forest. Looking out over the mountain side into the valley below and wept. I can not understand the pain and betrayal he must have felt. I feared that this could happen to me. I was fully in love and could be deceived. My love is only human. They are as full of flaws as me. I know this to be ture, but I cannot see them. No matter how hard I have looked she is perfect. 

* I had lost my strength and motivation that day. I thought what could drive my love to such betrayal. I also wondered what could make me betray her. NOTHING! yet how could I know until faced with the proposition? A wise man once said ""*Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point* ""-C. S. Lewis. I am a courageous man. I doubt anyone would question that. Yet, what if my honour gets tested and I make a small compromise. Then another instance I make another compromise. Again and again until the point where I no longer recognize the future me. That person surely would think differently and no longer love the love of my life. 


This fear I had. This is what I worried and lost strength. There could be someone/thing out there planting this deception into my head. Voices of comfort, a friend who needs help that influences less time to protect her. Who out there could be the master of deception and manipulation? What if there are multiple people trying to lead me the wrong way? what then? Can I spot everyone? How many people do I trust now that are already trying to pull me and my love apart? These are thoughts brought on by a verse and a story. To calm my mind I remind myself of who I am and what I do. I am a sword. I am action. Thought wastes my joy.    


**In Short:**
I  could really use your help finding a time stamp or a reference guide. I wept when Roy Dotrice read ""hands of gold"" by Symon SilverTongue. As well as everytime it was mentioned in passing. Does anyone know where/when I can listen to Roy Dotrice reading it?


* A video of what I could find. Beautiful, but not what I had in mind.

I started re-reading the series and I formed a theory as to who one of the heads of the dragon might be. I think that it could be Tyrion (this may already be an existing theory, I don't know.) My reasoning is that he's described in the books as having hair so blonde it's almost white (a classic Targaryen trait), he has an intense fascination with dragons (both in text, and the dragon skulls), an appreciation of fire, and was despised by his Tywin. I think that Joanna could have conceived a child from the Mad King (by force or otherwise (because Aerys had a crush on her)), which Tywin can really do nothing about except despise Tyrion with the intense hatred similar to that which Catelyn reserves for Jon. Tyrion even says that ""all dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes"", and the rampant incest in the Targaryen line could explain all of Tyrion's malformations.

I realized that because they are splitting ASOS into two seasons, as well as lengthening each episode by five minutes, the amount of detail each episode will need to have is much higher than previous seasons. 

for example: AGOT had about ~700 pages depending on what version you had. the first season of the show was very very faithful to the books. i'd say bout 90% was the same. this means that even though each ep of the first season covered about 70 pages, it almost all fit there quite nicely. asos is about 900 pages long, meaning each of season 3 and 4 should cover about 450 pages. this also means that season 3 will contain about 45 pages in each episode. this leaves us with either much more detailed episodes, or the addition of extra material. 

i know they are including the reeds and a few characters left out in previous seasons to this season, but i also believe they may introduce flashbacks. i know its a longshot but i believe that this extra space in each episode will contain some kind of flashback to many things referenced in the books such as the tower of joy, roberts rebellion, the greyjoy rebellion, etc. it would be pretty cool if they do this, albeit not likely. i just cant imagine how else they could go from 70 pages per ep to 45 pages per ep and keep the same pace. thoughts?",2,0,False,self,,,,,

The corpses never woke but allowed the Others to project there will onto the dead brothers of the Watch. Now you may be wondering ""Dead brothers"" my theory is that all of the Brothers that attacked Jon were actually thralls of the Other's in the same way that Coldhands lives, just more powerful.

* /u/Anthony_Hopkins

They're all regulars around here, so they're likely known to many of you.  It's our hope that the upcoming storm that is Season 3 will be weathered a bit more easily with their help.

And a big thanks to all of the other redditors who volunteered to help.  We were happy to have the problem of too many good options to choose from.  The stats are already showing traffic three times what we had last year, so the time may come that we want to add another mod or two.  If so we'll be sure to follow-up with the dozen other finalists to see who's still up for the challenge. :)

One of my biggest questions upon completion of ADWD is that of Jaqen H'Ghar. Who is he, who was he, hell...WHAT is he?

We know he was caged with Rorge and Biter, too obviously nasty pieces of work and not too seemingly out of place being kept in the Black Cells. 

So what exactly did Jaqen do to end up in there? That got me to wondering instead of why he was there not for the crime but with the ability to change his appearance at a moments notice, how he was caught to begin with.

My theory, is he intended to be caught. He intended to be kept in the Black Cells and that is where I like the rest of you wonderful people start speculating. 

My theory which I would love for you all to help me out with if you can recall facts that I missed/don't remember are:

He was there not to kill, but to save. Varys hired him and got him into the Black Cells where he was supposed to Impersonate his gaoler, whom was the ONLY person allowed down that far. Varys knew this as he is Varys. However, Varys managed to convince Ned to confess his treason and take the Black. Ned was supposed to be taken to the Wall in the same wagon as Jaqen. 

The plan was for Jaqen to release Ned from the wagon and pose as Ned himself. They wouldn't be looking for Ned, they'd be looking for Jaqen. 

This would have allowed Ned to escape, however that miserable son of a bitch screwed up Varys plan and what we see from that is the falling out from the plan, Jaqen being taken to the wall along with Arya who was supposed to stop at Winterfell on the return. 

Perhaps he realized who she was and sought to help her due to the aforementioned deal he had to save Ned, giving her the coin which got her across the narrow sea and serving...

Yeah...The Many Faced God.

Without wishing to appear overwhelmingly negative, I wanted to see what people thought certain characters were lacking. For a show that's so strongly cast it's made a lot more evident to me when an actor doesn't seem to fit a role totally snugly. For example, I was intrigued by [Conan Stevens](http://i.imgur.com/YJSfeBK.png)' replacement by [Ian Whyte](http://i.imgur.com/7CwVZvK.png) as Gregor Clegane, as (as much as he seems unlikeable to me due to the apparent egotism and entitlement and self-publicity on his blog) Stevens pretty much seemed bang-on as far as The Mountain goes for me, whereas seeing Whyte in that role just doesn't seem to carry the character's moodiness and violent temperament. He's basically just a tall guy in a suit of armour, it seems. Granted he doesn't have many lines to work with, but just not an actor that clicks with the impression I got of the character throughout the books, seemingly far more docile and measured.

Due to what everyone takes away from the reading being slightly different, what actors did you see in the show that just didn't convince you? I'm personally looking forward to seeing how faithfully Strong Belwas is recreated according to my impression, though not holding up much hope. He seems likely to be a tricky one.",130,15,False,self,,,,,

A) I read the first book something like seven or eight years ago and didn't really remember most of it. B) I'm terrible with names, so she constantly has to try to describe people to me so I know what the hell she's talking about. (It probably didn't help that I when I watched most of the series I was interrupted a lot.)

So, here's my awesome and fun idea. We're going to re-watch seasons one and two, and as we go through it, I'm going to take extensive notes. The eventual goal is to create several very large and possibly intersecting time lines. And then convince her to let me put them up on the walls of the office. I figure it'll be a blast, but also will serve to cement the minute details and fifty thousand names into my head.

I'm just not really sure how to go about building the time lines. I'd like to create a separate line for each significant individual or group of individuals. So like... one for Joffrey and that group, one for the guys up at the wall where's it's snowing all the time, one for Tyrion, one for that group of kids and Hodor. I'm not really sure how I should divide things and keep track of them.

Spoilers AGOT,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/18svfb/why_qotho_v_jorah_is_such_a_good_fight_spoilers/,[deleted],1361250936,"Even though the Qotho v Jorah fight is short in duration and simple in choreography, it is one of the [best sword fighting scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZm0pllFuaQ) I've ever seen.

Why? The fight actually has motivation, characterization, and stakes.

Take your average swordfighting scene from Pirates of the Caribbean or the Star Wars prequels. It's just a bunch of guys fighting because...the plot demands a climatic battle. You don't care about the characters beyond ""the good guy will win"".


Qotho v Jorah is much more grey and organically arises from the conflict in Daenerys's storyline. 

First you have the East v. West element and Qotho's apprehension of a foreigner having undue influence in a khalasar. There's also the element of Knight, armor, &amp; longsword vs. Horselord, vest, &amp; arahk. 

But more important is Jorah's and Qotho's motivation to fight. Qotho, ostensibly, is a loyal bloodrider concerned about a witch corrupting his lord with dark magic. However, you can't help but treat him with skepticism considering he's in the best position to become Khal if Drogo simply dies.

Jorah Mormont gives a valiant impression too, appearing to protect the recklessly injured Khaleesi and her interest in reviving Drogo. Jorah's willingness to die for Daenerys stands in stark contrast to his previous role as informant and sole goal of a royal pardon.

Of course, in the background is the impetus to finish the fight **quickly**. Mirri Maz Duur's unearthly chants serve as a tense time constraint on the conflict.

Finally, a foreshadowed scene bears fruit. Jorah taught Aggo about the advantages of Westerosi equipment versus Dothraki fighting style and that advantage is exactly how Jorah slays Qotho.

Brilliant. Just...just fucking [watch it again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZm0pllFuaQ) if you already haven't.

Personally, and I realize this will be controversial, but I would be more than happy to have no Lady Stoneheart. I did not like it in the book, and I fear it could signal a jump the shark moment for casual fans.

It's my 1st post on this subreddit

As the tittle says, I've already watched the series (when the episodes came out) and recently I've bought the Box Set of a *A song of ice and fire*. I received it around mid-January and breezed right through it, because I already knew part of the story due to the TV Show. I've heard that season 3 covers the 1st half of ASOS, so should I read it or no?

A thing that bothered me a bit, was the fact that Aryas and Daenerys storyline was very much far off from the books. [ACOK Spoiler](/b ""Why is it that one of Danys bloodriders are killed, along with Doreah and Xaro? At the end of a ACOK the three are both very well alive. On Aryas storyline, why do they make her an aid of Tywin Lannister? Is it just to save up time in the show? And why is no mention of the Tyrions chain in the battle of blackwater bay?"")

[ACOk Spoiler](/b ""Also, in the books there's a development with the valyrian steel dagger used to try murder bran, when Catelyn Stark questions Jamie Lannister. In the end there isn't a clear owner of the dagger, and who ordered the murder. Can I expect a closure on the matter in the following book? A Y/N answer will suffice."")

And can you guys help me translate a word from the books? What are ""the rushes""? I've seen it over and over again in the books, and I can tell it's something found in the bedchambers, but that's how far I've figured. Can you provide another word for it? Also, what is the difference between a raven and a crow? In my native language both words translate to the same.

Thank you so kindly.

How are the seasons in Westeros so unpredictable when the rest of the world seems to be unaffected. The Wall was never there before Brandon the Builder allegedly raised it with the help of giants. If the winds were to sweep from the North without the wall in the way, then perhaps the seasons in Westeros would not be so out of whack unlike across the Narrow Sea where it is always warm. 

The reason the winters are so bad in Westeros and why they last so long is they are the cold harsh winters that are able to blow over the wall instead of being deflected to the East and West, off into Bay of Seals and the Bay of Ice which are known as being notoriously cold. Further evidence is that at times it is reasonably warm, however still rather cold North of the wall and then you hear from Rangers that it at times is so bitterly cold they are forced to eat their dead, unable to move and barely able to survive. This seems to happen at fairly regular intervals or there are at least vast periods between these extreme colds. Seasons perhaps. What if because winter never seems to happen across the narrow sea, the fact the seasons are so out of whack is seen as normal? What if the seasons were more regular and predictable at one time? What if that changed if something kept the cold wind from blowing down into the neck and into Highgarden and Dorne? What if the reason those places never seem to experience any sort of cold weather is because only the harshest of the winters are able to overcome something in the way? What if a seven hundred foot high, league upon league long shield is preventing the cold weather from reaching these places. 

For me, these questions point to one thing, winter is literally being held back by the wall.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

Stannis doesn't explicitly have his own words, but ""ours is the fury"" is already on my house baratheon sigil and I do not want to duplicate. So any help with words we could use?

1. The Fury Burns

2. One Realm, One God, One King (leaning toward this one)

[Jon's parents theory](/g ""Jon Snow's dad is actually Robert. I mean, he has black hair like the rest of Robert Baratheon's children apparently do. Also since Ned felt the need to 'look' after Jon, I believe Lyana is his mother. If my sister, whom if I had one, died I would take care of the last thing closest to her, her child. Another reason this makes me speculate this reason is because on Cersei and Robert's wedding night, he crawled into her bed and called her 'Lyana'. I assume that's because they'd been doing the old bump and grind before."")

Here's a quick rundown of the main changes:

**Interface Design**

* The Spoiler tag coding has been updated for improved touchscreen/mobile support.  Use # instead of / for the new CSS.  The old tag code is still valid for legacy support.
* The header spacing is compressed to take up less space on the screen (for those with smaller viewing areas, especially mobile devices). 
* The header has been simplified with fewer, clearer header button options to just the most important links.
* The decorative sigils have been updated for Season 3 and now include House Baratheon of Dragonstone and Joffrey's Baratheon/Lannister arms.  
* The submit post page has been reworked with better directions for new users.
* The navigation banners have been updated to provide tabs for new options like the Wiki.
* Many minor adjustments have been made to fix spacing and formatting issues resulting from Reddit's recent changes.


**Content Update**

* The [/r/gameofthrones Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/) is now live.  All of the static info that used to be handled in separate posts are being moved there.
* The [Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) and [Spoiler Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide) have been updated and moved into the Wiki.
* [The FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/faq) that went down when the old wiki was turned off has been migrated, updated for Season 3, and expanded with more entries.  

A few more small updates/tweaks are in process and will be released as they are completed.  If you discover any issues with the new update, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) about it.

In ADWD, it becomes clear that Melisandre has taken a pretty considerable interest in Jon Snow, with her quest to [ADWD](#b ""save ""Arya"""") and Jon's repeated appearances in her fires.  Recall back, for a moment, to ACOK - Melisandre spoke to Stannis about the ""Stone Dragon"" that would need to be awoken in order for the true king to take back Westeros.  [Speculation](#g ""I theorize that Jon Snow *is* the Stone Dragon."")

This may seem like a pretty big logical leap, and to do so requires one of two major inferential steps.  The first, while the weaker of the two, requires no additional facts to exist - Jon Snow is very quickly becoming ""stone"" - forced to constantly make the most difficult decisions, realizing the incredibly complex political and social dynamics of The Wall [AFFC/ADWD](#b ""especially with Stannis, the Wildlings, and the Night's Watch all sharing the wall."")  He's already pushed away people that he cares about, and ""grown up"" in an absolute hurry - for the good of the realm and The Watch.  This might be enough to make the ""prophecy"" apply to Jon, but I think there might be a better, albeit far fetched way to explain the connection.

This explanation requires something that GRRM has never (as far as I'm aware) fully explained - the naming conventions of a bastard.  What we do know, however, is that a bastard is not necessarily named for his father - take Robert's bastards for example [General Spoilers](#b ""we know that he has a bastard with the name Storm (Edric), and another with the name Stone (Mya)""), so Jon isn't necessarily a ""Snow"" based upon Ned, nor [Speculation](#g ""a Waters or Blackfyre based upon Rhaegar,"") so the question remains - what is Jon's proper surname?  It's speculated that Jon was born in Dorne, as was hinted by Ned's dream and Edric Dayne.  If a bastard is named at the time of birth, then perhaps Jon should be Jon Sand.  If, however, bastards don't gain their name until a later time (as children were wont to die quite often in infancy), it's possible that Jon wouldn't have received his name until Ned was transporting the boy across the Vale - which would make him - you guessed it - Jon Stone.  If this is the case, perhaps this theory isn't so half-baked after all - [Speculation](#g ""Jon Stone would be the half Targaryen son of Rhaegar - a dragonblooded skinchanger - a combination that would probably be incredibly useful to Daenerys and her dragons.  If Jon Snow/Stone is the Stone Dragon, does that make Daenerys the rightful ""King"" of Westeros?"")  This theory makes further sense when you consider that [ADWD](#b ""Stannis is very possibly dead already, and Melisandre's visions have been very important (if not entirely accurate) thus far, and it would seem an awful waste if they lost all relevance because Stannis dies."")

I'd like to discuss the arguably tiny role the Boltons have played in the show thus far. No Roose at Harrenhal, no Ramsay with Theon at Winterfell, and as far as I can recall, little or no mention of the Ramsay /Hornwood problem in the North (maybe this was mentioned in the show; correct me if I'm wrong. But even if it was mentioned I feel this proves my point as well as it clearly wasn't brought up with enough importance to be easily remembered by someone who watches the series casually).

Anyway, I have several friends who all watch the show but have not/will not ever read the books. As the one bookreader in the group, I've spent the last couple months trying to convince them to just read the books. They're so good and I feel that their Game of Thrones experience will benefit greatly. No dice so far. Well, with Season 3 approaching I at least convinced them all to give the series a rewatch to refresh their memories. To prove my point I asked them all if they knew who Roose Bolton was and I received blank stares. Who?

This got me thinking that this is a severe flaw in the show. How will the Red Wedding and the eventual discovery of Reek's horrors at the hands of Ramsay, as well as Tywin's masterful seizure of the North be conveyed in the show with the same importance and subtlety that we all experienced in the books? Roose Bolton's murder of Robb was so powerful; here we have one of the North's most powerful lords and arguably Robb's most important and valuable advisor walking up and stabbing a sword through his chest. I feel that all of this will be lost on a casual viewer. Also, on a recent reread I realized just how devious and, well, OBVIOUS it became that the Boltons were quickly but quietly plotting their rise to power. I feel that it is one of most important and powerful plots in the series thus far, and I'm just very concerned how it will all play out in the show.

Anyway, I'll stop rambling. I have a lot to say on this matter but unfortunately I'm not so good at converting my thoughts to words. Thoughts?",5,5,False,self,,,,,

I know Ned made a promise to Lyanna, and it's rather widely believed that this promise (or part of it) was to keep Jon's parentage a secret, but he could have let Cat know that Jon wasn't his son without revealing who his parents really were.

Rory McCann's panel was very entertaining, he's a funny guy! The combination of Scottish actor and Scottish audience made it all feel rather relaxed and banter-y, which was nice.

But what do the snippets of footage shown in the one minute sequence mean for the content of the upcoming season?

* Tyrion still has his nose. It was fairly obvious this was going to happen, mainly due to makeup difficulties.

* Wall climbing will happen. I'm predicting this to come near the end o the season.

* A new castle. This is almost certainly Riverrun, however, they have chosen to have it elevated, as well as surrounded by water.

* Robb and Catelyn among dead bodies, in a castle. Unlikely to be the Red Wedding, since Robb and Cat seems to calm, and their are Stark guards nearby. Possibly Harrenhal, which will for whatever reason fall into Robb's hands. If not this then a castle in the Westerlands which has fallen. Yet this raises questions as to why Catelyn is there.

* Jaime Lannister with a beard, near others (possibly Brave Companions)

* Bran shooting a bow. Is he shooting it from Hodor's shoulders? Or will he find some other means from which to fire the bow? It could also possibly be a dream, as Bran appears to be standing.

* A man unsheathing a sword of fire. Beric Dondarrion.

* Something walking, possibly a white walker. However, we get a shot of the creatures' hands. Could this be a sign that it is meant to be Coldhands?

* Very short shot of a man tied up with a bag over his head. This might well be Theon, in the Dreadfort. Chances are, David and Dan aren't going to want to wait four years to introduce Reek, and will most likely do it this season. This could also mean we see Theon's torture scenes.

* Men (likely to be Wildlings) running across grass. Most likely the wildlings after they cross the wall.

* Soldiers lining up in formation. Almost certainly Unsullied.

* Shot of Daenerys turning to face the camera from the Unsullied. Calling it now that this is the shot we see before she orders the slave soldiersto attack Astapor.

* Catelyn saying (show them how it feels to loose what they love). Interesting to see how this is put into context, considering, Catelyn's actions regarding Jaime Lannister.

* Joffery telling Tyrion and Tywin that everyone is his to torment. Talking about Sansa most likely.

* A small boat being set alight. Hoster Tully's funeral.

* Shots of Jaime Lannister screaming. This will be the hand loss scene.

* A dragon flying near a ship. This will happen while Daenerys is sailing to Astapor.

* Final line of ""The revenge you want will be yours in time,"". This could relate to pretty much anyone.

With the official trailer released and season 3 coming ever closer, we saw a spike of  6,000 unique page views. We want to remind everyone that people who have not read the books still want to be involved and not have the slightest hints of a spoiler. This means all wink-wink nudge-nudge spoilers need to be tagged, no matter how obscure or ""inside"" the reference. Names of events that could make users paranoid of future events, I'm looking at you, [ASOS] (/b ""Red Wedding""), should be tagged so no ideas are foreshadowing what's to come. It's never a problem to overtag spoilers, esp. in threads directed at TV viewers.

For example:
[AFFC](#b ""Ser Pounce eviscerates a rat"") works perfectly because you *know* that highlighted text denotes a spoiler, and 'AFFC' refers to the novel 'A Feast for Crows'.  You therefore know that hovering over this text means a spoiler will be revealed for the novel A Feast for Crows.  Simple and easy.

A problem occurs when a post hits the front page of Reddit, because most visitors to the thread don't know any of these things!  Spoilers just looks like a normal link with a weird alphabetic code.  It has upvotes.  It must be interesting.  

And hopes and dreams are prematurely destroyed.

Would it not make more sense for these spoilers to simply be tagged as follows?
[SPOILERS AFFC](#b ""Ser Pounce kindly shared the rat's guts with Lady Whiskers"")

Just throw a big SPOILER word in front of all of them, instead of ASOS or AFFC etc.  That way it's obvious that it's a spoiler, and not some weird alphabetic code only discernable by the in crowd.

Discuss.

So far in the show she has been someone who the fans like and cheer for but with everything that has happened to her I have seen her becoming bitter. We know that she has dragons and that eventually they are going to get bigger making her a force to be reckoned with. When Aegon first came to Westeros the power that dragons gave him was too much for anyone to fight. This is how much power Danny will eventually have. It just seems like too much power for a ""good guy"" to have. People like to cheer for the underdog and a story were the protagonist has more power than anyone else is boring. [S2e9](#s ""In the house of the undying we see Danny in the Throne room of Kings Landing after it was attacked by dragons."") Now I don't know if that was prophesy or a magically induced dream. If prophesy I can't imagine that she would command the dragons to do that if she was still the same person we've seen so far. As I said I haven't read the books so if she has already turned evil by book 5 don't tell me. I don't want to know.  But I would imagine something like this would become apparent near the end of the story.

I think this would make the story awesome. Someone who you cheer for through the whole series until you realize how evil they have become. Then, knowing they are evil, when you go back and rewatch the series you wonder how you missed it for so long. [Breaking Bad Finale of last season](#s ""This is exactly how I felt about Walt. I didn't realize how evil he was until he killed Mike. Now watching back I don't see how I had been cheering for Walt these past couple seasons."") (I know, wrong show but I don't want to ruin that for anyone.) I also would love to see how Jorah would deal with Danny becoming evil. He wouldn't see it right away because of his love for her but has enough honor to turn away from her if she were to do something big enough. I can't wait to see how she turns out.

(Spoilers through Season 2 of show),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/198feh/questions_about_state_of_macropolitical_game_at/,timesnewboston,1361846208,"
I would assume this is already beat to death, but I googled around and searched though this sub with no good finds. Feel free to link me to an appropriate answer and I'll be on my way.

I have only seen the show, and neither know or desire to know any spoilers past that.

Here are the main motives of the main players in the game as I understand:

* Renly and Stannis Baratheon both want whats best for the people of Westeros, and ultimately to oversee its growth and safety from any pernicious forces, be they domestic or from Essos.
 * Stannis is bewitched/seriously egged on by Melisandre, and besides that is actually the rightful heir.
 
 * Renly (previous to death) knows house Baratheon is the real heir, but believes he would be a better king than his brother. 

* The Lannisters want the Throne simply to be in charge. Unlike the other main players, they simply have a desire for grandiosity and power.

* Daenerys Targaryen wants to benevolently rule and take care of the people of Westeros, and believes it is rightfully her throne because of her bloodline and her father was wrongfully removed from Throne. She wants revenge against the Lannisters for her father's death.

* Robb Stark wants to split from the Iron Throne because he wants to ""just take care of his own"" in a very narrow sense, meaning just Winterfell. This is due to a cynicism and bitterness towards governing all of Westeros, because it ultimately resulted in his father's death.
 * Tensions/distrust between Starks and Lannisters cause Robb to want to distance himself from the Lannisters totally, wanting neither to rule or be ruled by them.
 * The holder of the Iron Throne, if Lannister, would not allow this because Winterfell is a valuable asset in warfare and taxation. A simple alliance between the Iron Throne and Winterfell could not yield comparable benefits to the Iron Throne. Therefore Robb cannot let a Lannister hold the Throne.
 * although Rob wants to be neutrally separated from the Iron Throne, he obv hates the Lannisters and wants revenge/justice for his father's death. He wants to kill Joffrey and Jamie, possibly Tywin as well?


* The wildlings North of the wall want to flea that area because of it's shitty climate and white walkers. They're trapped up there because they're uncivilized and no one in the inhabited zones Westeros will have them. Ideally they'd be somewhere in Essos but have no means of getting there, and cannot earn their fares through indentured servitude cause they're too damn wild.
 * A ""king"" of the wildlings is trying to unite and organize them, to become strong enough to fight their way out of the far north. Not really clear if he/they want to conquer, kill, pillage, enslave, and/or settle peacefully and keep to themselves in the long term.


With all that stated, I don't understand what makes the Throne so desirable. Seems a bit like an arbitrary objective. 

Are there resources or strategic advantages to controlling King's Landing that one can leverage to enforce rule upon the rest of Westeros?

Do the people of Westeros outside of the Lannister, Baratheon and Stark houses have such reverence for the Throne's kingship that they will follow, support and obey whoever possesses it?

Thanks for reading. Answers to these questions or corrections/comments on my understanding of the state of the game are greatly appreciated.",15,18,False,self,,,,,

She fell asleep again around noon, a couple hours before I go into work. So I say 'fuck it', get up, and put S01E01 on and watch it for good times sake. 

Just as the episode is about to end, she wakes up to see Jamie and Cersei playing hide the sausage in the tower. Still groggy, I inform her that they're brother and sister.

To my delight a small expression of 'what the fuck' passes over her face and immediately afterwards Brandon Stark gets thrown out the window for a double wammy effect.

She rewatched the first episode and finished episode two before I went to work.

Needless to say I think we'll both be eagerly awaiting Season 3 come March.

I know it's kind of a broad and perhaps overdone topic.)

So my non-Game of Thrones-fan fiance said earlier today that the reason he couldn't get into the series or the books is because he ""knew how it all would end."" Because he is a big fan of The Walking Dead, BG, Dune, and many other high fantasy/Sci-fi book and show series I asked him to elaborate. He has watched the show in passing, so he has a decent knowledge of what goes on at least. He said to me it was because Game of Thrones and ASOIAF not only would, but only COULD end a certain way: with a showdown between Daenerys and ""whatever lies"" beyond the Wall, with Daenerys winning, because Daenerys was fire and the Wall was ice and it was ""practically spelled out for us in the title of the series."" I tried to rebut his prediction but to be honest, I hit a wall. It made a lot of sense but it absolutely kills the suspense for me.

Now it's all I can think about happening and it kind of sucks. I know there can be other conclusions than this but I really can't think of any. I was hoping the community would be able to speculate on a few different ways everything could go, or at the least provide me with a few decent rebuttals. 

Tl;DR: Fiance killed my sense of suspense by saying the series had to end with a fight between Daenerys and the creatures behind the Wall, I want different scenarios.",45,13,False,self,,,,,

I know it's not perfectly relavent to this subreddit, but there's not much time and George R.R. Martin doesn't do many conventions, so I'd figure I'd ask anyways.

Look, I know these ""like this page so X will happen"" are silly and I kinda have to agree, but my illustrious university, Texas A&amp;M, has decided to have a competition via Facebook to see which event it will promote. We have about 2 hours until the event is up, so any help would be amazing.
On one hand, we have AggieCon, which features George R. R. Martin and Ernest Cline. Kinda awesome. It's going on from March 22nd through March 24th in College Station. I can post more details when I find the webpage. All proceeds from the con's charity auction go to benefit Scotty's House, a local child advocacy center.

On the other hand is Powderpuff Football for Alzheimers. While this is a worthy cause, the vast amount of the money comes from local businesses and members encouraged to raise money. In my opinion, the promotion would do little to further the cause of raising money for Alzheimers.

Regardless, [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/430719937004062/430944866981569/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity) is a link to the event page that provides further instructions.
