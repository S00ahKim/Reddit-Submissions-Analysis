After Tywin's death, the dagger would probably be passed down to Jamie Lannister.

We have seen that Bronn prefers his dagger in close quarters, like when the two Gold Cloaks wouldn't let him enter Tyrion's room, so my question is this:

The circumstances were different in each scene however: In Theon and Robb's case, where they had the same themes, the executions were highly advised against by their relatives and friends, but they did it anyway out of anger, hence the distressed theme. Jon's decision on the other hand, was supported by both Stannis and pretty much the entire Night's Watch, so the melody wasn't as prominent. I find this interesting, as Theon and Jon share both similarities, despite disliking each other, through Robb, whom they both consider their brother.

Overall I don't regret reading the epilogue and I really enjoyed it. I can agree with the Book readers that everyone in the world would of went insane if that was at the end of S4. I think that it probably be a bigger surprise than the Red Wedding. 

So does anyone have any idea on why they cut it. We know about the Brothers without Banners we know who Catelyn is.  Maybe it is because that she doesn't do much until later in the series and she would just have be on ice until she did something. I guess no one can really answer without spoiling AFFC or ADWD so I guess I need to start reading this. (As a side note that one chapter was incredibly well written and makes me want to read the rest of the books.)

I have to say knowing nothing other than this I don't think it will be cut forever. It seems too important and too awesome for the to show to not include. ",17,11,False,self,,,,,

Their pasts ARE more dwelved into in the books, I'm reading the first book now and it already has been delving into Littlefinger and Catelyn's past, but who do you want to know about?

Tywin Lannister- We know about a lot of victories, but it would be nice to know about them a bit more in detail. It's obvious how he rose to power, but I'm also kinda curious to know what he was like as a kid. (Here comes the ASIOAF Wiki Links)

Grey Worm- This guy has to have an interesting past. First he's a kid, then he gets kidnapped, he gets his private parts cut off, and he has to go through the vigorous training of an Unsullied, only to be chosen to be the Commander by the soldiers themselves, and it had be a good reason. I'm guessing at some point, Grey Worm did something that made all the other Unsullied go, ""Wow, this guy is tough. He should be a leader."" I'd like to know what that was.

Khal Drogo- For pretty much the same reasons as Grey Worm. It is obvious he became Khal by winning battles, but I wanna know what exactly he did to become Khal, and what kinda fights he got into.

Varys- We know a bit about his past, how he was cut, but from there to becoming the Master of Whisperers, is kinda unknown, at least from what I know. He said he has done things to get to his positions, big things I am gonna assume. I would love to know what things Varys did to become such a powerful figure.

Littlefinger- For the same reasons as Varys. He comes from a small house and became one of the most powerful people in Westeroes, and has a talent for befriending powerful people. Though I'm sure his story is not as dark and exciting as Varys, but maybe I'm wrong, it'd be nice to know. 

Jaquen- This guy used to be a normal guy, then he became a Faceless man. How? Why? I wanna know about that.

That's all I got for now, maybe I'll add more later in the comments. But what characters do you want to know more about their past?",30,20,False,self,,,,,

When Davos first sees Stannis again after being released from his imprisonment he looks haggard. My theory is that Stannis died at the battle of the Blackwater and Melisandre resurrected him. 
We know that it's entirely possible for red priests to resurrect people as proven by Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion, and Melisandre's power apparently makes Thoros' powers look like child's play. Thoros was revived 6 times and when Arya sees him she notices that he looks really haggard, nothing at all like the man Jeyne Poole was swooning over at the Hand's Tourney. 
Now, there's nothing huge to support this other than Stannis' appearance. You never actually hear anything about Stannis' rumored death or anything really to confirm this. It's a question that may never be answered, but it's an interesting thing to think about and it's adds depth to Mel's desperation of trying to make Stannis Azor Ahai.
It's also quite possible that the reason for Stannis' appearance is solely due to the physical and emotional drain of losing an important battle, and the betrayal of his first Hand, and the lack of sleep that goes with that. You could also say that the reason Beric seemed to age so much is that he was pretty brutally killed quite a few times. 
Whether or not this theory has any real basis it's an interesting topic to consider and i'd like to see what anyone else thinks about it.

As a foreword, I am very aware that the show deviates from the books, so let's keep this discussion to the show only:

1. Remember when Jaqen H'ghar helped Arya and friends get out of Harrenhal? Afterwards they had a little chat. Why did he say to her that she can offer all those names on her lips to the Red God, when she has to renounce her identity, thus renouncing her revenge? I think that because Jaqen said ""A girl wants to serve herself."" to her.

2. Why Stannis and friends seem to suddenly forget about the White Walkers threat? They went to The Wall because of the White Walkers, now they will be marching on Winterfell?

3. Where are the White Walkers? We've seen the host at the Fist of the First Men, we've had the off-screen battle. Now are they hibernating somewhere? Are somehow aware about the situation in Westeros, so they wait to strike when the Seven Kingdoms are most vulnerable or something? 

4. Why is Jamie so keen to protect Sansa? He instructs Brienne to get Sansa somewhere safe. And I'm gonna quote the Hound: ""Safety? And where the fuck's that?"".

Would Ice have been used in battle? it seems almost a waste to leave a Valyrian steel sword at Winterfell, Valyrian steel being so powerful and superior, but would it have been effective or even safe to use? or would it have been an impractical weapon. perhaps it's use depends on different factors.

I assume they get paid for it, but that's not really grounds for a religion, anyone can kill people for money. What's their moral or spiritual reasoning behind why they should kill people who don't want to be killed, at the whim of their clients?

 Also, why do they believe that total servitude to the House of Black and White/loss of one's identity is so important? There doesn't seem to be much motivation to become a Faceless Man, and give up everything you own and are to sit around in a dark room all day. Arya doesn't seem to have those motivations, she just seems to want revenge for selfish reasons, so why does she want to join this religion? so I guess I'm mainly confused about how a group like this would attract members or why anyone would start one in the first place.

From what I can recall, he...

- Didn't assassinate Daenerys

- Helped Tyrion escape

- Ran away

These accomplishments (or lack thereof) are rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things; especially when compared to the schemes of characters like Tywin. In addition, Varys has had some major failures, such as when he failed to convince Olenna to keep away from Baelish.

Yet, despite Varys unremarkable achievements, everybody on this subreddit treats him as though he's an equally influential threat as Little Finger.

Don't get me wrong, I really like the character. His witty dialog, enlightening monologues and amusing expressions make him one of the most entertaining characters on the show. I just don't see why the television Varys is treated with such reverence.",22,10,False,self,,,,,

For example, the unsullied have their faces nearly completely obscured by their helmet/masks, and when they become emancipated, essentially becoming individual humans with identity, Greyworm can remove his mask.
Here the abnegation of identity through the obscuring of the face is a mark of powerlessness and enslavement.

Another, Jaqen H'Ghar, has ""no face,"" but here the obscuring of the face is a sign of power and freedom. Here to, we see the facelessness as an abnegation of identity, as we see that Arya needs to divest herself of this identity to free herself from the limitations of it.

Other ""masks"" and similar themes include, the Shadowbinders of Qarth, the Faces carved in Heart Trees (and Isle of Faces), the Stranger as one of the Seven, Sons of the Harpy...etc etc.

One of the things that I've come to wonder is what are the Ironborn using their ships for?

I've read quite a bit about their long history of plundering villages and towns of Westeros for food, supplies and Thralls but that obviously became impossible after Aegon the conqueror forced them to bend the knee and become part of the 7 kingdoms. This would mean they haven't done any pillaging in the last 300 or so years. Unless of course they've only shifted their focus from Westeros to somewhere else. The first thing to pop to mind is Essos. But after a quick look of the map that seems to be unlikely as they are situated on the West of Westeros and thus would be required to sail all the way south and around Dorne which seems to be a lot of effort for very little pay off. As far as I know they are attacking villages not Cities, which means they're stealing from peasants and farmers mostly who are very poor and have very little of value. Why sail all the way around Westeros to reach Essos only to come back with modest harvests and useless trinkets? They could of course be pillaging somewhere else, someplace on the West of Westeros and thus easier to reach but I`ve never seen any maps nor heard of any land further West then Westeros as we know it, so probably not then.

So if they haven't been pillaging Westeros, Essos or anywhere else, what have they been doing the past three hundred years? It seems that for a land that lives almost solely off the things they pillage and steal they have no place to actually get these things from. Where have they been getting their food? Their supplies? Their Saltwives? And their Thralls? 

If all of their mining and farming is done by Thralls and they have no plundering to do what have the true Ironborn been doing for the past 300 years? I know they have many ships and are very good sailors but it seems as if they have no reason for actual sailing? You would assume they'd travel to Essos to buy exotic foods and items to sell back to Westeros. It'd certainly seems to make that far trip worth it but that'd make less sense then anything else since that would mean paying the gold price instead of the iron price. And I've read on A Wiki Of Ice And Fire that Ironborn can not pay for Thralls but they must be captured. So how exactly have they been getting their Thralls?

I'm very curious about this and incredibly intrigued about the Iron islands. I'm not sure if the topic is touched upon in the book at all so feel free to chip in with some conjecture. 

Also sorry if this question has been asked before/is stupid/or has no place in this thread.",12,22,False,self,,,,,

I don't recall Renly having the awesome green armor.

However, there were some things that caught me by surprise. Theon's appearance immediately seemed very different. I don't even recall there being much description of Theon, but from what I gathered, he seemed to have straight, black hair and attractive features. I never really found Theon to be much a pretty boy.

The other things that caught me off guard were the appearances of Tyrion and Dany. It's hard to unpicture them due to the show, too. I knew Dany had silver hair because my best friend read the books and when I asked about casting once a long time ago, he said ""Tyrion's pretty ugly in the books, and Dany has silver hair.""

What no one told me was Tyrion had two different colored eyes, and that Dany had purple eyes. I feel like the silver hair was entirely possible to do for the show. She already has the wig, why not just make it silver?

Overall, the book feels much more ""fantasy"" oriented than the show. Magic always sort of felt kind of subtle at most in the show. Magic seems much more prominent in the books. Overall, it really feels like it has more fantasy elements than the show gives credit to.",4,11,False,self,,,,,

First of all, their weapons and fighting style did not suit the narrow enviroment they were in. But barring that, lets look at the biggest problem. 

**None of these Unsullied have actually fought anything before**

Aside from training and slaughtering poorly armed and trained masters, they haven't actually fought against anyone before. In Astapor, the Masters were poorly armed, in Yunkai, a small ""special forces"" group of Jorah, Dario, and Grey Worm open the gates to allow the Second Sons in. Finally in Mereen, it's a slave revolt that puts Dany in power

Dany was told by Krasnys to ""blood them early"". She did not. The entire time the Unsullied have been glorified city watch and bodyguards. Very few of them have actual combat experience outside of training drills with other Unsullied. 

This could potentially explain why the Unsullied did not defeat the Sons of the Harpy without taking severe losses. No matter how brutal your training is, if you fight in a scenario your training didn't prepare you for *and* have never actually fought anyone, you could be in trouble. 

Edit: ITT people who think the Unsullied should suddenly decide to start carrying short swords despite never once using them in the show, people who think Phalanxes work when completely surrounded, and of course, ""but in the books"" people",96,0,False,self,,,,,

In fact, it probably will. It needs to in order for the story to be finished before all the kids are in their mid-30s...*but*...

What if, just to give GRRM a *little* extra time for WOW, Season 6 was done entirely as a flash-back? I feel like even as good of a job as the show runners have done, show watchers are missing an awful lot of backstory (especially if R+L=J). I mean, honestly, if you only watched the shows, other than a handful of mentions in the first half of the first season, would you even have any hint that Lyanna Stark is an important figure in...well, everything?

---

Imagine... Season 6 starts off with Tywin Lannister being called upon by King Aerys II to serve as Hand (providing a convenient parallel to the start of the show). Later we see young Jamie and Cersei bidding each other farewell as Cersei leaves with her father for King's Landing (more parallels). Fast forward a bit and we see Jamie named to the Kings guard, then off to the Tourney at Harrenhal. We're introduced to Rhaegar and Lyanna for the first time in the flesh. We get to bring back Sean Bean from the dead! Intrigue as Rhaegar favors Lyanna, then later abducts her! We see Brandon go to kings landing to demand the return of Lyanna, and Rickard coming to his rescue when he's arrested. We see both burned by the mad king, bringing us to Robert's Rebellion. Ned journeys from the Vale back to the North, and returns with his banner men to join Robert's cause. The battle of the trident! The sack of Kings Landing! Jamie earns his title as ""Kingslayer"".

Finally, as a kick-ass way to wrap it all up, Ned rides up to the Tower of Joy. What's this? Kingsguard? But why??? Fighting! Deaths! When the dust settles, only Ned and Howland Reed remain. Ned climbs the tower, only to find his sister lying in a pool of blood, dying. One last promise she asks of him... **to raise her son as his own bastard, and tell no one of his true parentage!!!**

It was not overwhelmingly much, but in at least two scenes (Littlefinger-Sansa and Kelly C. - Selmy) the topic came up. 

If is R+L=J is true, I think it would be wise for Dan and David to put Rheagar and his relationship with Lyanna in a good light. That's just my opinion. I find the idea of Jon beeing a love child way more appealing than him beeing a product of Rhaegar raping Lyanna -what Sansa heard - given Jon's potential importance in the future of the story.

Additionaly, in the last episode there was  this scene with Stannis talking to his wife about Jon Snow, where he said that Ned Stark having a basterd is so untypical for him. Another wink in the theory's direction.

That's their entire point: to be short sighted idiots acting childishly in order to represent people who don't know how to play the game of thrones. In the books, they are cliches straight out of something like Charlie's Angels (one of them is even a hot nun who plays overly innocent but is a cold blooded killer - it barely doesn't get more ridiculous than that).

The point is that, yes, after experiencing unfairness and loss it's normal to want revenge and to cause your enemies pain as soon as possible but it doesn't work that way in the real world. Every step has to be carefully planned because the something going wrong could be the end of you, your family and your cause. 

And that's why Doran rocks. He knows how to play the game. He makes himself look weak to make everyone (even his own family) underestimate him and waits for the right time to strike. Then the kids and their dumb plan almost screw it up because they don't know shit about the world but he is able to put that fire out before it burns their house down. After they've been taught their lesson, the Sand Snakes are ready to be used properly, which is gonna be awesome.

Bronn: *rolls eyes* Ya ok just say the word dude you don't have to BS me.

When Daenerys is getting them off the slave-master in Astapor he tells her ""they are untested, you would be wise to blood them early,.."".

They lined up well enough when killing the masters in Astapor, but it seemed to be an very easy task for them, they were already in formation and attacking instead of defending. Plus since then,  they have nobody to keep them disciplined and in order. Grey Worm's a good warrior who was never meant to be a leader.

We've heard how good the reputation of other unsullied armies has been in the past, but that's probably with them still as slaves and a good military mind like Stannis behind them to command. Now they're free they seem to have lost their fighting spirit as well. All this easily explains them getting their ass kicked in an ambush. Thoughts?

The scene that all book-readers were hoping to see in the TV series. Removed certain references.

-------------------------------------

I am here for [](#b ""Hizdahr""), [Barristan] said. Throw down your steel and stand aside, and no harm need come to you.

Khrazz laughed. Old man. I will eat your heart. The two men were of a height, but Khrazz was two stone heavier and forty years younger, with pale skin, dead eyes, and a crest of bristly red-black hair that ran from his brow to the base of his neck.

Then come, said Barristan the Bold. Khrazz came.

For the first time all day, Selmy felt certain. This is what I was made for, he thought. The dance, the sweet steel song, a sword in my hand and a foe before me.

The pit fighter was fast, blazing fast, as quick as any man Ser Barristan had ever fought. In those big hands, the arakh became a whistling blur, a steel storm that seemed to come at the old knight from three directions at once. Most of the cuts were aimed at his head. Khrazz was no fool. Without a helm, Selmy was most vulnerable above the neck.

He blocked the blows calmly, his longsword meeting each slash and turning it aside. The blades rang and rang again. Ser Barristan retreated. On the edge of his vision, he saw the cupbearers watching with eyes as big and white as chicken eggs. Khrazz cursed and turned a high cut into a low one, slipping past the old knights blade for once, only to have his blow scrape uselessly off a white steel greave. Selmys answering slash found the pit fighters left shoulder, parting the fine linen to bite the flesh beneath. His yellow tunic began to turn pink, then red.

Only cowards dress in iron, Khrazz declared, circling. No one wore armor in the fighting pits. It was blood the crowds came for: death, dismemberment, and shrieks of agony, the music of the scarlet sands.

Ser Barristan turned with him. This coward is about to kill you, ser. The man was no knight, but his courage had earned him that much courtesy. Khrazz did not know how to fight a man in armor. Ser Barristan could see it in his eyes: doubt, confusion, the beginnings of fear. The pit fighter came on again, screaming this time, as if sound could slay his foe where steel could not. The arakh slashed low, high, low again.

Selmy blocked the cuts at his head and let his armor stop the rest, whilst his own blade opened the pit fighters cheek from ear to mouth, then traced a raw red gash across his chest. Blood welled from Khrazzs wounds. That only seemed to make him wilder. He seized the brazier with his off hand and flipped it, scattering embers and hot coals at Selmys feet. Ser Barristan leapt over them. Khrazz slashed at his arm and caught him, but the arakh could only chip the hard enamel before it met the steel below.

In the pit that would have taken your arm off, old man.

We are not in the pit.

Take off that armor!

It is not too late to throw down your steel. Yield.

Die, spat Khrazz  but as he lifted his arakh, its tip grazed one of the wall hangings and hung. That was all the chance Ser Barristan required. He slashed open the pit fighters belly, parried the arakh as it wrenched free, then finished Khrazz with a quick thrust to the heart as the pit fighters entrails came sliding out like a nest of greasy eels.

Blood and viscera stained the [](#b ""king's"") silk carpets. Selmy took a step back. The longsword in his hand was red for half its length. Here and there the carpets had begun to smolder where some of the scattered coals had fallen. He could hear poor Qezza sobbing. Dont be afraid, the old knight said. I mean you no harm, child. I want only [](#b ""the king"").

He wiped his sword clean on a curtain and stalked into the bedchamber, where he found [](#b ""Hizdahr zo Loraq""), hiding behind a tapestry and whimpering. Spare me, he begged. I do not want to die.",40,204,False,self,,,,,

1. Season 4 - So many fascinating plot twists I never saw coming. The death of Geoffrey (I loved seeing that little punk suffer), the whole who killed Geoffrey guessing game ( it was so much fun trying to guess who it was &amp; the actual perpetrators I didn't expect), Tyrion's storyline with him being falsely accused of the murder, Arya's at first glance awkward &amp; uncomfortable relationship with the hound turning into a rather lovely one. Brienn's fight with the hound is one of the best fights I've ever seen ever in my life. The whole ending with Tyrion killing Shae &amp; Tywin was so compelling my jaw was literally dropped for 10 mins after seeing that. You could feel the pain on Tyrion's face &amp; the dark place he went to after killing Shae. So much more I could get into but yea this was by FAR my favorite season.


2. Season 1 - One of my favorite things about this season was that so much happened in so little time which I appreciate much more now given the crawl speed I feel like season 5 is in. This is where we were introduced to this beautiful but horrifically haunting world. We are introduced to all the characters &amp; laid the groundwork for the amazingness that would follow in the following seasons. Without this season this show doesn't happen plain &amp; simple. Ned Stark was such an interesting character, one of the few genuinely good guys this show had &amp; seeing him this season was fascinating to watch. Him dying set the tone for the rest of the show, basically telling the world ""yea we have the balls to do what no other tv show is willing to do"" &amp; has been consistent in showing that throughout the show. Also this show has one of the best pilot episode cliffhangers in my opinion. Right away we are introduced to things you just don't see in television &amp; they never shied away from it (incest comes to mind).


3. Season 2 - #3 &amp; 4 rankings for me are very close together for me but the reason why I put this ahead is because of Tyrion's storyline in this season. He is one of my favorite characters on the show &amp; to see him have actual real power and to use it to screw over some bad dudes in King's Landing to try and restore some order was badass. His character is fleshed out so well and he becomes 10x more likable. The battle of the blackwater episode is one of the best battles in TV show history. We were introduced to Stannis, Melisandre, Davos, Margery, Brienn, major characters that are still relevant. Dany learns a lot of valuable life lessons &amp; in the end she makes some pretty bad ass moves I commend her for. The whole house of the undying with Dany was pretty compelling &amp; don't tell me you didn't tear up when she was briefly reunited with Drogo. Great stuff.


4. Season 3 - The only reason this is below season 2 is because the Tyrion storyline put it over this one. This season had imo the most infamous moment in GOT history referred to as ""the red wedding"". I was so disturbed &amp; gut punched after that episode it took me a couple of days to process. The show had a hold on me at that point that I didn't even realize until I felt it. Catelyn stark was such a sweet woman why??? Why did she have to die why George why?!?! Ughh...
Dany gets her unsullied army this season &amp; barbecues that slave owner bald idiot who talked crap to her in Valyrian. Hehe when he got burned &amp; dany ordered all the soldiers to kill the slave masters was just an awesome moment. She conquers two cities this season which is refreshing to see her storyline pick up pace and not just meander about in 1 area for a season. This season she's an unstoppable force of nature. I can't remember much else from this season but yea still great great stuff all around. 


5. Season 5 - This is by far &amp; away my least favorite season so far. Everything just feels off, the acting, the dialogue, the pace is way too slow for my liking, and the show is more predictable than it's ever been. Obviously it's only up to episode 4 so it has room to grow &amp; improve but from what I've seen so far I'm so disappointed. 


So what's your list of favorite to least favorite GOT seasons &amp; why? This is just basing the TV show seasons on their own not the books.",15,3,False,self,,,,,

Well, here comes a pretty big post, and a topic that I have been wanting to cover since season 3 in the ""adding context"" series, but have not been able to due to it not being brought up in the show, but with Sansa and Petyr's conversation in the Winterfell crypts in last night's episode I can finally break down one of the most important historical events in the Lore of both the novels and the show... The Great Tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC.  The Tourney at Harrenhal is the catalyst for so many other events that transpired after, and the event that sparked the downfall of a 300 year dynasty, and the event that happen to lead to the series as we know it, and it is my pleasure to break it down for you..  I hope you all enjoy..

**Note on Spoiler Scope**

As always this is post is tagged to correspond with the most recent episode as well as to cover anything in the books up to where we are in the show for the sake of what can be discussed in the comments.. For the body of this post I will not go into spoilers past ASOS, and general Lore, however I will discuss something in this post related to the Tourney at Harrenhal that has not been mentioned in the show, and that is story of the ""Knight of the Laughing Tree"" which comes from a tale Meera tells Bran in ASOS, I don't think that particular story will ever be brought up in the show, but you never know, but I will be breaking it down here.. it will have it's own section if you wish to skip over if you wish...  Other than that this thread is guaranteed non-reader safe....  

---------------------

**Shadow Hosts and Feuding Dragons, the reason the Tourney was held**

- Lord Whent the Host of the Tourney

The year of 281 AC, the year of the False Spring, known as such due to a period of warm weather the Realm enjoyed during the most recent winter before the cold of winter returned.  It was during this unseasonably warm weather that the then Lord of Harrenhal, Lord Walter Whent announced that his castle would play host to the largest Tourney the realm had seen in many years, a tourney to celebrate the name-day of his maiden daughter.  The Tourney proved so large due to the sheer number of people attending and the amount of competitors that would visit his castle during the Tourney from every corner of the realm, but why then?  What possessed Lord Whent to host such a lavish event at Harrenhal?

Lord Whent was known to say he was convinced to hold the event after visiting Kings Landing prior to his announcement and spending time with his brother Oswell Whent, a knight of the Kingsguard.  The Tourney would be grand and give the knights of the Kingsguard and the realm as a whole a chance to compete and win glory... the tourney would also serve as a venue to properly introduce to the realm their newest brother, Jaime Lannister (more on this later), when he would take his vows of the Kingsguard.  Lord Whent also had stated he wanted to show up the lavish Tourney that Tywin Lannister had held in Lannisport for the King 5 years earlier.  But there was one major issue, Harrenhal was not the most lavish of venues, far from it, and Lord Whent was not particularly an overly wealthy Lord. Thus such a Tourney would be too expensive for Lord Whent to host, but host it he did.  It seems clear that Lord Whent had some financial help to aid with Lord When in paying for the Tourney and for the Champion's rewards, but who?  Which someone, who had the gold, could help finance such a large tourney and act as a ""Shadow Host"" to the Tourney at Harrenhal?  History suggests it might have been the son of King Aerys II Targaryen himself... Prince Rhaegar.  


- The King and the Dragon Prince.

Despite later going to war together and both dying for their family, Prince Rhaegar and the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen did not have a good relationship.  Aerys in his madness had long been paranoid of everyone and everything around him, and that extended upon his own son.  After the Defiance of Duskendale the king earnestly began to believe that Rhaegar wished to depose him of his throne, he believed that Rhaegar and Tywin Lannister may have plotted to led Lord Darklyn of Duskendale kill him while in captivity.  After Duskendale the King preferred to remain in the Red Keep, where his parnoia and madness would fester.  This paranoia was not only limited to the King himself but to his newly born son Prince Viserys as well. Prince Viserys in his early years did have Aerys' favor, and it was rumored that the King wished to disinherit Rhaegar and name Viserys as his heir if given the chance.  The King refused to attend the Wedding of Prince Rhaegar and Ellia Martell of Dorne, nor did the King wish to have contact with the children of that union, claiming that they ""smelled too Dornish"".   Things were not improved when Prince Rhaegar and his family decided to leave the Red Keep to relocate to Dragonstone, which only increased the King's paranoia.. paranoia that was not completely unfounded.  

Rhaegar was not oblivious to his father's madness, and after seeing his father make bad decision after bad decision, become cruel towards his loyal servants, (both before and after Duskendale) it became obvious to him, as well as several other nobles that the realm would suffer if Aerys remained in power too much longer.  So perhaps the King was right to be paranoid when thinking his son wished to remove him of his throne, because it is likely that was indeed the case, which leads us back to why the Tourney at Harrenhal was being hosted.  It is likely that Rhaegar financed the tourney as a pretext to call together the Lords of the Realm together and discuss removing Aerys from the Throne, citing his madness. However, these talks between the Lords of the Realm and Rhaegar never took place, whispers of this plot made their way back to Kings Landing via informants of the Master of Whispers, Lord Varys, the Spider.  It was then that for the first time in years, for the first time since the Defiance of Duskendale that the King would leave King's Landing and attend the Tourney himself.  If Rhaegar ever did intend to meet with the lords of the realm to depose his father, the King's decision to attend never allowed for that to happen....

-----------------------

**The Lion and the Dragon**

One of the more notable events of the Tourney of Harrenhal was the swearing in of Jaime Lannister as a brother of the Kingsguard and the effect that would have to play on events going forward, but first a bit of background on how this came to be..

- The Hand's resignation

Tywin and King Aerys have a long history together, a history that goes back to their childhoods, too much to go into here, but we can begin here with the more recent slights that Tywin was given by Aerys and what led to not only Jaime becoming a member of the Kingsguard, but to the resignation of his post as Hand of the King.  The first major slight was during the tourney at Lannisport held by Tywin himself in honor of the birth of Prince Viserys, and the knighting of Prince Rhaegar.  The issue came when Tywin sought to betroth his then 10 year old daughter Cersei to Prince Rhaegar, as well as secure a squiring position for his son Jaime to the prince, both offers were rejected outright by Aerys stating that his son could not marry a servant of the crown.  (On a side note, it was during this tourney at Lannisport that Cersei visited Maggy the Frog as we saw in episode 1) 

Despite the rejections, Tywin remained on as hand of the King, after the Defiance of Duskendale a year later, the King's paranoia as discussed continued to grow, and some of his paranoia was focused on Tywin.  During these last few years that Tywin served as hand he barley met with the King.. this all eventually culminated when a newly knighted Ser Jaime Lannister won renown fighting the Kingswood brotherhood.  King Aerys ultimately made the move that would lead to his death in naming Jaime to the Kingsguard, depriving Tywin Lannister of his heir.  This proved to be the last straw for Tywin as shortly thereafter, under the pretext of personal illness he resigned his post as Hand of the King and returned to Casterly Rock.. King Aerys was happy to oblige..

- Jaime at the Tourney

As I said, one of the most notable events of the Tourney was the swearing in of Jaime Lannister to the Kingsguard.  It is worth note that of the thousands in attendance, his father was not among them, remaining behind at Casterly Rock.  Jaime was however accompanied by dozens of his father's bannermen however who cheered his swearing in and presentation of a white cloak.  Jaime had hoped to distinguish himself in the lists of the tourney, however that wasn't the case.. In one last insult to Lord Tywin, King Aerys called in Jaime's vows immediately and commanded him to travel to the Red Keep to protect the Queen and Prince Viserys.. Jaime, disappointed, obliged and was no longer a part of the events at Harrenhal.  

------------------

**The Crannogman and The Knight of the Laughing Tree**

In ""A Storm of Swords"" via a story Meera Reed tells to Bran Stark about a few events that took place during the Tourney at Harrenhal.  She tells us the story of her father, Howland Reed, and what he encountered while attending the tourney..most importantly that of the story of a Mystery Knight that appeared within the lists, the story of the ""Knight of the Laughing Tree"".  In this story Meera uses aliases to refer to the characters that appear, she refers to her Father as ""the Crannogman"", Aerys Targaryen as ""The King"", Prince Rhaegar (The Dragon Prince), Brandon Stark (The Wild Wolf), Ned Stark (The Quiet Wolf), Lyanna Stark (The She-Wolf), Benjen Stark (""The Pup""), The Kingsuard (The White Swords)...among others in telling what her father witnessed during the tourney... I will be using the real names, and not the aliases Meera uses in the next few paragraphs..   

- The Sights and Scenes of the Crannogman. 

Meera tells Bran that her Father while traveling through the Riverlands and visiting the Isle of Faces on the Godseye near Harrenhal that Howland Reed had seemingly stumbled upon the tourney being hosted there. There he noticed many different Lords, knights, servants, and followers of the vast array of houses attending the tournament, and was marveled by what he saw.  However being of the small stature common of the Crannogmen of the Neck it was not too long before Howland ran into a handful of squires who began to bully him.. Howland was rescued however by none other than Lyanna Stark who told the squires off stating that Howland reed is among her father's bannermen and invited Howland to visit with her family attending the tournament.  It was with the Starks that for the rest of the tournament that Howland kept company with.  Howland noted that during the merryment of feast held by Lord Whent that the Starks joined in the festivities.  Howland noted that Ned Stark was nervous in asking a woman he admired (Ashara Dayne) to dance, until his brother Brandon Stark asked on his behalf.  Howland also noted that during the feast that Rhaegar sang and played his harp for the attendants, and that it was so beautiful that it made Lyanna cry.  A very young Benjen Stark had laughed at his sister for this and in response she dumped a glass of wine over his head...  Lastly via Meera's story, Howland Reed recalls what transpired the next day during the jousts when a mystery knight appeared in the lists, a knight known only as ""The Knight of the Laughing Tree"" ..

- The Knight of the Laughing Tree

The Knight of the Laughing Tree is not only brought up within Meera's story to Bran, but is also mentioned elsewhere in the books as well as the recent ""World of Ice and Fire"" supplementary book as well. So I will take this part out of the context of Meera's story going forward.  

During the second day of the Tournament a mystery knight appeared on the lists of the joust.  This Knight, known only as ""The Knight of the Laughing Tree"" is described as short of stature, with a booming voice, and wore ill-fitting armor.  The Knight carried a unique sigil upon his shield that of a smiling, or laughing heart tree, which earned him his moniker.  During the jousts the mystery knight challenged the Knights of the squires that had bullied Howland Reed.  The Mystery Knight was successful in unhorsing those knights.. In lieu of demanding the armor or horses of the Knights he had unhorsed as a tourney ransom, the mystery knight only demanded that those Knights teach their squires honor and respect.. After that the KotLT disappeared.  This event caught the attention of several Lords and Knights who sought to unmask him (Including Robert Baratheon), but most importantly the attention of King Aerys himself, who convinced himself that the KotLT was an enemy..  So the King sent prince Rhaegar to seek out the knight, and unmask him for all to see.   Prince Rhaegar was unfortunately unsuccessful in tracking down the mystery knight only finding the shield of the laughing heart tree dangling ironically in a Wierwood outside the walls of Harrenhal.  

Book readers have no clue who this mystery knight is, but have speculated on the identity of the Knight of the Laughing tree, if wish to discuss this in the comments I'd love to hear your responses and ideas as to who this could be.. Just be sure to green-tag it.

The Sand Snakes were hardly amazing characters in the books but holy crap that scene was beyond terrible. Straight out a Scify TV movie. Their acting is pretty bad, their motivations pretty absurd, the random exposition was hilarious and none of them look like serious characters that fit into the world, they're supposed to be fearsome warriors but they're all small, thin girls with crappy looking weapons, they seem more like cartoon characters.

Also, the final combat scene also had terrible coreography. For one sending the unsullied to patrol narrow hallways with long spears and without short side arms would be completely bizarre. Dany may not understand that but she still had several experienced people in combat to her service, so not one of them mentioned this?

And if for some reason that's all they gear they had, with all their discipline why didn't the Unsullied do their best to keep up in formation even in the hallway? it would have made them infinetely more effective than trying to go 1v1 with long spears against guys with daggers.

Finally, that Barristan scene that was supposed to be a badass final stand was just crappy. Usual crappy coreography with 5 guys surrounding someone but going at it one by one. Hell, at one point I think I saw one of Sons of the Harpy with dagger in hand walk right by Barristan's back to move to the other side and do nothing like, you know, stab him while he's completely vulnerable.

Doran- Head badass. Dudes got a particular set of skills that he doesn't even need to leave his chair to use. It's been theorized that he and Oberyn were poisoning Tywin during Oberyns visit and even if he lost a major piece of his game, Doran used his influence to help in the murder of Tywin and the Zombification of the long lawless arm of the Lannisters (Gregor) which basically sent their family into a death spiral. Doran has only been seen at his favorite place, The Water Gardens where we saw Ellaria (or whatever) give her speech. Doran is a high level player who has basically been sitting on the sidelines while the bulk of the seven kingdoms eats itself alive. He has a minimum of 10,000 troops on call judging by the size of Dorne and it should be noted Dorne, much like the north, is almost impossible to invade without seriously superior numbers and some sort of anti-guerilla super solider like a dragon.

Ellaria- Paramour of Oberyn and scream face champion of 2014. Bitch has a hard-on for vengeance right now and who wouldn't? She watched the man she loved get his head crushed in by the dude who raped and murdered his sister and his sisters children. Literally the worst person in Westeros crushed her man's head like an egg. She seems firey right now and is still in emotional turmoil. She's making decisions which are out of line with her culture and beliefs and I'd ask you to give her character some time to develop.
*Note We haven't seen the princess of Dorne yet unless I missed her. Ellaira might be taking her place so I promise there will be much more to her if that's the case.

Sand snakes- Not sure how the show will decide to treat these ladies but honestly they are forgettable in the books. They definitely have roles to play but they are pretty far from a lot of the action right now. But given that they are basically a deadly viper assassin squad I feel like they have some pretty cool scenes coming up.

Axe man McGuardy guy- Doran's personal guard. I'm gonna be watching the shit out of this guy because he's a badass.



Motivations for all of Dorne:

-Dorne is a desert, everyone is a bunch of hard, unyielding fucks who as Bronn said ""like to fuck and fight and fight and fuck""

-Dorne bent the knee to the Targs and only the Targs, much like the North.

-""You Raped her, You Murdered her, you killed her family!"" Is like the first thought on anyone's mind in Dorne when it comes to Lannisters and their supporters.

-Dorne is much more progressive than a lot of Westeros and more modern in a lot of their societal values. Bastards are embraced like true born, children are given a place to live off the streets (the water gardens) and the country has managed to remain neutral through like 4 separate wars now.

-Women can rule in Dorne so the line of succession is age based more than  anything. I could be wrong but even a bastard of the royal line can legally gain the dornish throne through succession.

If anyone has anything to feel free but I hope this helps a few of you look more positively on the future of Dorne.",4,15,False,self,,,,,

They are fearsome trained warriors, some of the best in the world, and have beaten opponents outnumbered before... *on the battlefield*.

Do the Unsullied outclass them?  Yes.  However, one could draw a simple parallel between this and American troops in Vietnam.  Even if you are outclassed in equipment and training, home court advantage goes a long way.  After a rewatch I'm not so sure that they had enough people to form a decent phalanx.  They also were without short sword.  If you take away the wide open areas where a spear is an advantage it becomes relatively difficult to use in close quarters.

I guess you could say that Barristan died a realistic death given that he was outnumbered and surrounded but I would argue that it was a bad scene both from a storytelling and logistical perspective.

For storytelling the death felt like it was something straight out of The Walking Dead  (which is a very enjoyable series but is in another league of campiness compared to GoT). We haven't lost any popular characters yet this season so it felt like the writers were obligated to give a tragic death just for the sake of a tragic death, so they write a scene were Barristan tells a sentimental story about Dany's brother and we become more empathetic to Barristan and more hopeful for his future as Dany's advisor. If I had been watching TWD I would have immediately known that Barristan's time was up but since it wasn't I thought little of it. It's a cheap emotional exploit and I'm sure we will be anticipating it in future episodes. 

In the last four seasons we've heard everybody exclaim about how Barristan is the best sword fighter who ever existed and we've been hyped up for this moment for so long. I understand that HBO has a history of not giving the viewers what they want to see but this just seems like a waste of good characterization. I don't see what this death does for the story other than giving us another reason to hate these harpies, who seem like a temporary enemy to test our patience before Dany is prepared to attack Westeros. 

As for sword fighting I should mention that I'm not an expert but a few months ago I saw a great deal on groupon for 12 hours of beginner sword fighting classes. Obviously I'm still a novice but in the first 2-3 hours of classes I learnt enough about sword fighting to criticize almost every movie and TV sword fight ever. From the very beginning Barristan displays poor technique with his amateur sword grip. First of all you don't hold your sword out at full length parallel to the floor, because it limits the range of your vertical guard, it's exhausting, and it limits your ability to feint, jab or wind up your strikes. It's usually a bad idea to hold your blade horizontally as well because it also limits your options for your next move and favours one side over the other. It would be like seeing one of the best tennis players in the world who anticipates the opponents serve while holding his/her racket in the backhand grip. 

Barristan also demonstrates poor crowd control as he walks straight into the group of enemies and even turns his back to them on multiple occasions. He even lets a few of them get behind him before he starts the group fight! He only survived as long as he did because of plot armor and the ubiquitous trait of bad guys who only attack one at a time. I suppose he did redeem himself by killing several of them before he's taken down but the whole scenario could have been executed with a lot more skill from both parties and still had the same result.

----------
So everyone is talking about the fight between the Unsullied and the Sons of the Harpy. A lot of us are saying how stupid it was for the Unsullied to use spears in that narrow hallway instead of their short swords, and also that that it just doesn't make sense for these famous warriors to be taken out by The Sons of the Harpy. There are also those who say that the Unsullied have been out of practice and that they have only been training and haven't been in any actual fights. I think that the Unsullied should have won that battle.

---------
Ok, so the Unsullied have been trained to be ruthless warriors since they were born. Under Dany's control, they haven't been in any actual, heavy duty battles. This shouldn't matter against the Sons of the Harpy, who are most likely just rebellious slave masters. While the Unsullied have been training all their lives, the Sons of the Harpy must have little to no training compared to them. The only instance we've seen of a Son of the Harpy before this episode was the one who killed White Rat. It was only an assassination, quick and easy, and completely set up. Then after that, we saw that they knew how to hide well, as the Son of the Harpy hid himself inside a wall. From this we can gather that the SotH are more of assassins than fighters, which goes well with the fact they are most likely slave masters with little training.

----------
So now we get to the fight between the Unsullied and the SotH. This particular group of Unsullied is marching about the streets of Meereen. First off, they are led by Grey Worm, the leader of all of the Unsullied. From this we can assume that they are among the best warriors of the Unsullied.

The Unsullied are then lured into a narrow hallway by the SotH. This is smart thinking by the SotH, as the primary weapons of the Unsullied are long spears. However, it is not their only weapon. As seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/13VaT), the Unsullied do in fact have daggers and were equipped with them during the fight. Daggers seem to work so well for the SotH, so why didn't the Unsullied fight with daggers as well? Well, it only took a stab to his side before [Grey Worm got the right idea](http://i.imgur.com/q4uPEjU.jpg). 

---------------
So, in my opinion, the Unsullied should have won that fight. They were trained to kill since they were born and were equipped with armor and daggers. Not to mention, while the Unsullied all have fit bodies, [The Sons of the Harpy weren't exactly the strongest looking guys in the show](http://i.imgur.com/EFhmG8R.jpg).

And then Barristan came in. He was just strolling about town and heard a commotion. He took out a ton of members of the SotH by himself, and unlike the Unsullied, he wasn't wearing any armor. Yeah, sure, he was well known as probably the best fighter in the Seven Kingdoms, but he was old, outnumbered, and unprepared. He went out like a badass.

------------
TL;DR: The Unsullied have been trained to kill since they were born and were actually much better equipped than the SotH, who are most likely rebellious slave master with barely any training. The Unsullied are supposed to be prepared for anything, even fights in narrow hallways. Also, Barristan went out like a badass.

1. The Unsullied fight bothered me so much. They were trapped in an enclosed space and were given so much time to set up a formation. Why did they just stand around looking all gung-ho? If they had closed ranks, locked shields and kept the Sons of Harpy out of range they would have had a much greater tactical advantage. Aren't they called Unsullied for their battle training?

2.  On the other hand, the Sons of Harpy could have done better. Had they engaged them in a narrower corridor it would have been easier to kill them. The Sons of Harpy can disguise themselves and walk right up to the patrolling Unsullied, or ambush them from behind a door or something. Once they get within stabby-stabby range, those long-ass Unsullied spears are going to be as useful as waving a dick around. Spears keep the enemy away; but once the enemy is beside you a spear becomes a useless wooden stick.

While everyone is seeing Ellaria and the Sand Snakes for some cheesy vengeful characters because of one poorly done scene, I'm seeing them for what they are as plot devices... x factors.

Now what do I mean by X-Factors? Let's take look back at Joffrey as what he really was, a tool for other peoples' plots and an x factor. Between Littlefinger's, Cersei's, and Varys' plot alone, Joffery was a key variable. Why? Not just because he was King (which is obviously a huge factor), but because he seemed predictable (much like Ellaria seems probably seems to Doran now). Predictability is an asset to the great schemers because it makes you seem containable within their plot. So, when they collectively corraled Ned to the dungeon with their plan, they all expected Joffrey to heed their council and throw him to up North to the wall where they can keep an eye on him. They expected they could corral this predictable little sadist boy into their plot like most everyone else. What does Joffrey do? CHOP NED'S HEAD OFF. X FACTOR BITCHES. This then sets into motion a war that Littlefinger wanted, a war that put Cersei and King's Landing in fucksville for a while, and probably sped up Varys' timeline considerably. Not to mention the countless wave size ripples it made in the main story and in the characters themselves. All because of Joffrey the x factor.

So how do we compare Ellaria's situation to a situation like that? We have to speculate. She wants war with the Lannisters and pretty much anyone in her way. This is much like how Joffrey wanted war with anyone in his way, though for different motivations. Did Joffrey have more power? Sure, but that also meant that things were expected of him which made him at least a little more predictable. There really doesn't seem to be anything expected of Ellaria and the Sand Snakes which IMO is way more dangerous, but even though nothing is expected of them, they still seem predictable due to their obvious motivations which could mislead Doran into believing that they are dangerous but containable in whatever plot he's cooking up. The point is, they are seemingly predictable characters that are now molded by seemingly tactless bloodlust, but this is part of what makes/made them dangerous: we know their motivations, but we have no idea what they are capable of actually doing. That's what makes them an x factor, that's what gives them the potential to shit in everyone's sundae, or potentially enable a previously unseen plot, and that's why I'm pretty fucking excited.",0,0,False,default,,,,,

**edit:** To address a comment below by /u/sluggernaut, I will say that in both situations, the plotters were/are probably trying to predict the unpredictable by thinking that people can be ""predictably unpredictable"", which they came to find out that there really isn't such a thing as being ""predictably unpredictable,"" there's just unpredictable.

However, I personally dont think the show fucked up too badly here (at least in terms of a realistic presentation of the fightwithout getting into whether or not D&amp;D should have killed off Selmy and possibly Grey Worm).

The Unsullied are generally hyped as great warriors, but keep in mind that they were also trained to be *slaves*. Their military training essentially consisted of having specific battlefield tactics drilled into their heads through force and violence. Because of this, they were trained to obey orders without question, *not* to think for themselves. Thus, while their abilities as slave soldiers in traditional military formation are probably unimpeachable, they most likely lack creativity and the capacity for improvisation in combat.

Thus, when they are surprised in an ambush attack and suddenly surrounded on both sides in an enclosed space, they would be at a disadvantage, which makes their failure to form up more understandable, IMO. Their rather unimpressive attempt at taking on the Sons of the Harpy one on one was a result of their basically having no training in how to change their battle strategy without orders from their owner in response to radically changing situations. The show (and books, if I recall correctly), have hinted that Dany has been using the Unsullied in for things they were never trained to do, and this heavy loss at the hands of the Sons of the Harpy is likely a result of that. So, in my view, that fight was not unrealistic at all and does not lower my opinion of the show.

Let me know if I'm crazy or not:

Brienne is following Sansa and watching over her from afar in Winterfell
Jon wrote a letter to Roose, informing him he is Lord Commander
Stannis marches on Winterfell to root out Roose but leaves Melisandre behind
Brienne finally has her chance to encounter and kill Stannis, either killing him or during a fight being captured by the Boltons, either way the Boltons find and capture both of them
The Boltons, now in custody Stannis (dead or alive) send Jon a letter taunting him, claiming they killed Stannis (regardless of whether or not they did) and also saying that they have Sansa, threatening her safety
Put over the edge, Jon rallies a band wildings to march on Winterfell
The breaking of his vows causes other brothers to stab Jon and in this scene salt (most likely tears), smoke, and some sort of flaming sword will be incorporated even if metaphorically
Melisandre, left behind by Stannis, will be there to revive Jon
Because the Nights Watch vow is until death, Jon is now able to leave the Watch and march on Winterfell to save Sansa

The Unsullied warriors have just been lured into a trap by the Sons of the Harpy. After cornering the Unsullied in the narrow alleyways the Harpies know they can use close quarters combat to their advantage against the experienced fighters. The masked warriors ready their knives and prepare to surround and cut down the Unsullied. The first thing I would do is change the ratio of Unsullied to Harpies. I know you only have so many extras to work with... make 8 of them Unsullied and like 50 of them Harpies instead of the 40/20 ratio we got in the show.

The Unsullied, even trapped and outnumbered, will not go down this easily. Gray Worm removes his helmet so we can see the actors face on screen, since that's how movies and TV work. This can be logically explained so that his peripheral vision doesn't suffer in tight quarters and so his commands can be heard more clearly. He barks out an order in whatever cool language they're always speaking on the show and the Unsullied move into formation.

Standing shoulder to should with spears and shields raised the Unsullied await the charge and brace for attacks. The Harpies come at them in waves, charging into the Unsullied like madmen. They knew there would be casualties if they wanted to take down a group of Unsullied.

The first dozen or so land on spears and die brutal deaths and here it starts to become a bloodbath. The second wave of Harpies starts climbing over the backs of their fallen comrades, stabbing wildly at the Unsullied and driving them back. They use the bodies as shields, the shields as stepping stones, break spears, stab for the weak spots in armor, swarm at the Unsullied and drag them to the ground one at a time. Even with such a great formation, its hard to make use of the spears in these conditions. Gray Worm ends up alone with another twelve guys still surrounding him. He's got his back to the wall and, for the time being, is holding them back. None of the remaining guys wants to be the one to get impaled by the spears so the others can close the gap.

Then Barristan will appear. This is the one part I'd keep mostly the same because it was pretty damn epic. When a 70 year old man appears on the battlefield generally nobody is going to care. When Barristan the Bold appears on the battlefield everyone stops what they are doing. Two Harpies remain to try and accost Gray Worm while the others turn and stalk toward Barristan. They move cautiously because even the Harpies have heard of his legendary combat ability and fear to tread to close to Ser Grandfather. If they want to take down Barristan they know many more of them must die.

Barristan advances methodically, cutting down the enemies one at a time and using their fear against them. With his armor and superior combat ability he's making short work of them. I want to see knives getting turned away by his armor while some find their way into the weak spots. Five or more men go down with little trouble. Then he notices that Gray Worm has been pinned down by the two Harpies that stayed behind. They have him on the ground and are both trying to hold him in place while stabbing at him, and even landing a few of those attacks as he struggles to grapple with the two.

Here Barristan would kinda lose his cool a bit and start to advance more rashly, because he realizes that he needs to reach Gray Worm in time. Although he is skilled enough that he could probably win this battle with good odds, he has to put himself at a disadvantage and rush to try and save Gray Worm. This results in him getting surrounded and grappled by Harpies as well. Rather than just a few wounds, I'd have these guys ripping Barristan to shreds with their knives. You see stories in the news of people who got stabbed forty or fifty times and survived. Whether Barristan is gonna live or die next week I think they should really have made the knives seem more deadly than they did. During this struggle he can take down most of the guys swarming him but he'll still end up on his knees with a knife to his throat.

Gray Worm, having managed to deal with his assailants, comes to rescue Barristan at the last second. Much like we saw on Sunday. But this time Barristan went down looking like a boss, both of them took way more serious wounds, and the Unsullied showed they were no joke. The Unsullied lost because they were vastly outnumbered and in spite of their great combat formation, not just because they suddenly forgot how to fight. Barristan's downfall isn't that he was outplayed, but he was forced to act rashly for the sake of protecting an ally. Both Barristan and Gray Worm are in a position where you could believe they would die from their wounds, but have hope they might survive. And if that was their end you know they died looking as heroic as possible.

I'm honestly not sure why we needed the episode to end with Gray Worm and Barristan in the position they were in, but I hope that my version of events shows that it would have been possible to make the fight a lot better with some very minor changes. If you are wondering why people might be upset about that scene maybe this alternate script can be a bit enlightening. I think what I wrote is more in line with what people would have accepted from that scene, in terms of logical consistency. Hopefully my post demonstrates how what we got was not on the level of quality that we'd expect from Game of Thrones. ",1,14,False,self,,,,,

I really hate Daenerys, she's a stuck up, entitled, arrogant bitch who needs to get what's coming to her.

I don't really dislike anybody else, but I'm not a huge fan of any of the Stark children, besides Jon Snow.

He quickened his pace and rushed into an alley as a stream of people pushed the other way.  Far down the path stood Grey Worm, frantically twirling his spear to fend off a dozen Harpies.  The space between the two was littered with corpses of both the Unsullied and the Masters, as well as over a dozen still living of the latter.  For any man, saving his friend would have been an insurmountable challenge, but Ser Barristan the Bold was not any man.  Sword flew from sheath to hand in the blink of an eye and just as quickly it was buried to the hilt in the throat of a Harpy.  Ser Barristan wrenched it free, spinning on the balls of his feet to cut another from shoulder to groin.  Awareness spread through the group of the new threat.  Just as quickly Selmy flew from man to man, leaving each with a lethal wound.  Two of them attempted to flank the knight, lunging at him from opposite sides, but Ser Barristan pirouetted gracefully, deflecting one knife and sidestepping the other and just as gracefully he freed the two from the mortal coil.  The Lord Commander of the Queensguard paused for a moment to catch his breath.  He cursed silently, if only he were twenty years younger.  The remaining few abandoned their assault on the injured Grey Worm.  It was the last mistake they would ever make.  Ser Barristan feinted left and struck right, sending a Harpy reeling backwards.  Four left.  The sound of footsteps made him wince.  A booted foot struck out behind him catching his would be assailant in the chest, followed closely by Barristan's sword.  Now four.  
""Yield and face the mercy of our Queen.""
No response.  The greatest knight since The Sword in the Morning grunted in disgust.  The tip of his sword flew through the air, sending up fountains of blood from the remaining Harpies.  Around him lay the bodies of twenty slave drivers.  Just another days work for Ser Barristan the Bold.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

Seriously, in my mind this theory is now virtually proven, and if by reading this you come to agree with me, I take no responsibility for any regrets you may have about feeling prematurely ""spoiled"".*

*I also realise that many of you who do read this will just be thinking ""well, duh"" the whole way through. I guess I just wanted to make a compilation of all the things that point to* something going on *behind the scenes.*

I've re-watched parts of episode 4 a few times and taken note of a few things that I didn't think too much about the first times.

It's pretty obvious that Melisandre wants to be impregnated by Jon (""the power to make life""), presumably to make another shadow baby (""the power to cast a shadow""). What went unnoticed by myself until I watched it the second time, however, is the significance of the scene with Sansa paying her respects to her deceased family members, and Littlefinger talking about Lyanna. He recounts how Rhaegar, in his words, ""chose"" Lyanna over his wife Elia. Sansa echoes what she's been told growing up: Rhaegar would go on to kidnap and rape her aunt. Littlefinger then gives her a slightly condescending (accurate term?) look, as if he clearly knows better... but her face is turned back towards the statue again and she does not see this.

As best I can recall, this is the first time on the show proper that it has been questioned this directly whether Rhaegar really did take Lyanna with him without her consent. Even in the *History and Lore* videos on Robert's Rebellion, only the POV narrator of Viserys Targaryen suggests that he might *not* have kidnapped and raped her, as far as I remember.

Notice in particular how the topic of Lyanna Stark is not remotely meant to be the focus of this scene. Why is Sansa standing at her aunt Lyanna's crypt, anyway, rather than her father's, or her uncle Brandon's, or her grandfather Rickard's? At least Ned was on the show for *one* season.

That's not all, though. Before Melisandre goes to visit Jon, before she comes to shoo Sylese away so she and Stannis can talk in private, Sylese is expressing her disdain (accurate term?) for Stannis for ""[thinking] highly of ... a bastard by some tavern slut"". To this, Stannis replies, almost off-handedly: ""Perhaps. But that wasn't Ned Stark's way."" Sylese then expresses her guilt about not having given her husband a son herself - which was what prompted her to bring up Jon in the first place - before the scene proceeds to Melisandre checking with Stannis and Stannis checking with Melisandre (you know what I mean, don't pretend that's not what he meant by saying: ""and you, my lady, what do you need""!). Once again, Jon and his parentage is not the focus of the scene at all, but merely used as a tool to trigger the main focus - yet there it is.

Oh, I just thought of *another* detail as I was writing this: We even have a scene where Ser Barristan talks about what good times he had with Rhaegar in King's Landing, how good a singer Rhaegar was [book lore](#b ""(and remember how Lyanna was brought to tears at his performance at (IIRC) the Tourney at Harrenhal)""), how he liked to mingle with the ""smallfolk"", donate his money to them sometimes, and about just what an all-round good guy he was... We've had those kinds of descriptions of Rhaegar before, of course, but never quite in such detail, and never quite in a way that really told the viewers what sort of *person* Rhaegar was. And a few minutes later, Barristan gets into a fight, and *possibly killed* (god that scene was so fucking dumb...).

What does all this mean, I wonder? :) I'm sure many of you have heard of the theory that Jon Snow's true parents were precisely the aforementioned Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. There are plenty of things that point to it, after all, especially in Ned's chapters. I haven't yet read the books past mid-ACOK, so I haven't seen for myself what counts *against* it. Still... why these ~~two~~ three seemingly insignificant details in one episode, along with a scene that clearly confirms that Mel wants Jon's genes inside her? It's almost as if they're setting the stage for something here.

Add to all this the fact that Melisandre knows Ygritte's affectionate catchphrase for Jon, and it is increasingly apparent to me that Melisandre, at the very least, has some sort of ""spiritual"" insight that makes her believe that Jon has the blood of the Targaryens. Indeed, about *what* is it that Jon Snow knows nothing, in this case? :)

Could this be the season where will learn if R+L=J is true? I have long felt that if the theory really is true, GRRM had better reveal it in the next book, or it will become so worked up that it will just be a huge anticlimax when A Dream of Spring eventually comes out in 2022 or something. But that's me; having already read about the theory when I read through AGOT, I thought it was painfully obvious that it *must* be true when Ned is sitting in his dungeon cell, craving to ""see [Jon] again, sit and talk with him"", dreaming of ""beds of blood"" and ""broken promises""... What does it mean, why does he feel so deeply ashamed at the thought of Jon? If he did bring Jon back to be raised at Winterfell instead of by ""some tavern slut"", he surely gave the boy a far better shot at life than he would have otherwise had... or what?",3,4,False,self,,,,,

1) Tywin Lannister- I think a rather significant part of Westero's current state of affairs is due to Tywin's awful parenting skills. Furthermore, It goes without saying a mature Tyrion married to Tasha with his blessing would have saved his life. 3/10 for at least building an Empire for them. 

2) Ned Stark- Surprisingly, Ned's track record isn't that fantastic. Theon constantly worried about his head getting chopped off while living with the Starks, a certain bastard thought working with a band of ex-rapist in black is his only positive outlook in life. on top of that, marrying his daughter to a man of questionable morality, not to mention failure to call the thing off after seeing the boy clearly as a liar. Oh, and killed Lady.  5/10

3) Cat-Even if we disregard her infamous ""I wish it was you"", some of her advice were at least partially responsible for the current Stark's affairs. 4/10

4) Dany- Thankfully, Mrrri the Maester managed to end the Great Rapist before it hatched. I will give her a 10 for consolation...then I remember she now have 10,000 children she could not manage. 5/10. 

5) Mace- 6/10 for selling daughter to psychopath for Crown. But at least she wanted it. 

6) Doran Martell - 1/10. Sorry, not only you cannot trust your children (which let your daughters making some rather stupid plans), you actively SACRIFICED your son because you think ""Since he is my flesh, he is the only piece I can use."" You already took your son from his mother just to appease a powerful lord, then just as he begin to find a nice girl, you had him sent across the damn world to bed Dany in some manifest destiny duty. Now only he isn't a good seducer, he ended up getting cooked alive. Holy fail. 

7) Balon Greyjoy - Totally a Jerk, forced his son into a awful situation, then, well, you know the rest. 3/10 on the misery he caused isn't spreading to anyone else but his son.  

8) Renly Baratheon- Heh. Good one.

9) Robert Baratheon- 0/10. 

10) Cersei Lannister- 3/10 At least in the book/show she showed concern for her children. 

11) Stannis the Mannis- Refuse to sell his daughter out for any kind of political gain, actively educate her because she will be Queen someday, risked a plague breaking out in the castle to save her, and finally ""You are my daughter"" line may actually show more love than most of these people on this list.

Things are aligning too perfectly, and the show has a habit of bringing back familiar faces to help complete arcs. Arya has only connected, I would say successfully, with a few characters: Ned, Jon, Syrio, and Jaqen H'ghar. Finding that two are one in the same will help her develop, and help complete a training arc that she's going through (having the same teacher), so she can eventually exact whatever revenge she's planning.

Born, raised, and living in very liberal California as a gay dude of the millennial generation, I've had the fortune never to be the recipient any kind of gay-bashing. (To be sure, it can still be occasionally found in this day and age in even the most tolerant of places). For me, dime-a-dozen news articles about such violence occurring in less tolerant areas of the world passes before my glazed-over eyes with the same indifference to which my mind has been desensitized by modern news &amp; social media.

This is a popular catchphrase of an organization called [Pink Pistols](http://www.wbez.org/news/i-feel-better-knowing-i-have-option-not-being-victim-105766), a group in North America which advocates gun ownership by LGBT people to protect themselves and provides a social setting for group training in safe and accurate firearms. I don't belong to them, nor do I own a gun, but I certainly agree with the principle of anyone sticking up for themselves.

Many fans have commented on Littlefinger's negligent security for his brothel, considering the amount violence and general disorder that has occurred near or within it, and the high price that many of his customers would be willing and able to pay for the extra discretion afforded by improve security. This post does not seek to belabor this point. Instead, it occurred to me that the queers of King's Landing would be wise to organize and begin arming themselves. Suggested names: Rainbow Rapiers? Sassy Sabres?

I highly doubt the show is going to spend that much time on this issue such that we would see the development of such an organization. However, Tommen's decision not to use violence has really left me craving the blood of Faith Militant. My bloodlust would be sated if Olyvar - and/or Loras, if he makes it out of his current predicament alive - had some screen-time as a gay avenger.",5,0,False,default,,,,,

One of my favorites. And being immensely popular, it naturally got an anime adaptation. Unfortunately, the first anime adaptation was created before the manga was even halfway done. Naturally, the anime ran out of source material halfway through and improvised the rest.

Sounds familiar? Unfortunately, the anime absolutely went bonkers, with the stuff they improvised being absolutely godawful. So god awful that pretty much anybody who has never read the manga can pinpoint where the anime ran out of source material. And honestly, who wouldn't have seen that coming? If I told you that an adaptation is going to dramatically veer from the source material, I guarantee your natural reaction is ""ewww"", since we've already been trained by decades of failed adaptations that thought they were too good to follow the source.

After watching the 4 episodes of this season, I am more and more confident that show will follow FMA's template. For the previous 4 seasons, I've defend the changes made in the show again and again, and I just can't do it anymore. Every single episode this season I've found myself repeating ""WTF THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE"" at least once every 10 minutes. Nonsensical plotlines, characters acting completely out of character (Littlefinger advertising to the world that he has Sansa and thereby pretty much confirming he had a hand in killing Joffery, Brienne acting like a complete idiot in every scene, paranoid Varys decides to go into a city with his dwarf friend without any protection whatsoever, Jaime decides to go get Myrcella in hostile territory like an absolute moron, a plan so stupid it makes Cersei's plans for Myrcella in the books seem actually smart), scenes that make no sense (Arya's ""trial"" in getting into the house of black and white was a complete waste of time, Jon Snow appointing an illiterate kid with barely a month's worth of training as his steward, not to mention he has an incredibly hard time turning down Melisandre for some reason), and don't even get me started on the Sand Snakes. 

I get it. The show creators are cramming multiple storylines and characters together in ways they were never meant to. This involves characters making absolutely stupid, nonsensical decisions, pushing toward endings that the previous seasons in no way were built for. Unfinished storylines from previous seasons will be left hanging (Iron Islands, TBWB, Gendry), new storylines will be hastily crammed together, and characters will be rewritten in bizzarre ways in order to make things actually flow. Just like FMA.

Now you might say, the original material from previous seasons weren't actually that bad, so we should have faith! That's because they weren't really creating new stories most of that time. They were adding more interactions between non-pov characters, and other window dressing, but the end results and stories weren't particularly different. They can focus on the dialogue and writing, without dealing with storyline consequences. When they've added completely new things (Dany season 2, Ros, Asha's rescue, etc), the results have been pretty terrible in general. Plus, the new storyline decisions they've made this season have not improved my expectations.

I really wanted to see signs that GOT won't go down FMA's path. I really do. But everything seems to be getting worse, the dialogue, the characters, the directing, the writing, the general sense of ""they know what they're doing"". Hence my prediction: in the future when the perils of running out of source material to adapt is mentioned again, FMA will no longer be that posterchild, it will be GOT.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying deviating from the books is a bad thing. They just could've done it so, so much better. 

On a side note, after the FMA manga was finished there was another anime remake that was a faithful adaptation throughout, allowing us to banish the first adaptation from our minds. Hooray. ",6,0,False,self,,,,,

i came across this on a subreddit about George R Martin, in which he sends a letter to his editor briefly explaining the plots for the up and coming books (Book 1&amp;2)

in one paragraph GRM spoke about Jon &amp; Arya's relationship

""Jon Snow, the bastard, will remain in the far north. He will mature into a ranger of great daring, and ultimately will succeed his uncle as the commander of the Night's Watch. When Winterfell burns, Catelyn Stark will be forced to flee north with her son Bran and her daughter Arya. Hounded by Lannister riders, they will seek refuge at the Wall, but the men of the Night's Watch give up their families when they take the black, and Jon and Benjen will not be able to help, to Jon's anguish. It will lead to a bitter estrangement between Jon and Bran. Arya will be more forgiving... until she realizes, with terror, that she has fallen in love with Jon, who is not only her half-brother but a man of the Night's Watch, sworn to celibacy. Their passion will continue to torment Jon and Arya throughout the trilogy, until the secret of Jon's true parentage is finally revealed in the last book.""

Anyone think this will play-out ....

Stannis plans to march to Winterfell to take it from the Boltons so he has control of the entire North.  Let's say he defeats the Boltons, what's his plan then?  He needs to maintain that power over the North, but he obviously can't stick around, so he needs to leave someone there who he can trust.  Obviously Sansa is the key to keeping the loyalty of the northern lords, but he needs someone to marry to Sansa from his own ranks in order to join the houses Baratheon and Stark.

Stannis doesn't have any male heirs, and since the show has cut many characters there are no real men of power close to Stannis.  Who is the only known Baratheon alive in the show?  **Gendry.**  Who is the only person who knows where Gendry is?  **Davos.**

So, is Davos hiding that up his sleeve?  Is he going to fetch Gendry to return to Westeros and marry Sansa, giving Stannis a reliable hold on the North?  Remember that Davos independently tried to convince Jon to take Winterfell, so it wouldn't be surprising for him to propose this alternative to Stannis.  Plus, he's gonna be ripped AF from all that rowing and Sansa will be like *swoon*",75,55,False,self,,,,,

-We know that Stannis fucked up bad by not trusting Melisandre during the Battle of the Blackwater. 

-The subplot of Gilly's baby probably will not exist. 

I am going to theorize that Melisandre will demand someone be burned for the Lord of Light, and that person will be Shireen, since she has the king's blood in her. Stannis will either:

A) Burn Shireen, and we will all do a 180 and hate the Mannis

B) Refuse, and not receive a blessing from the Lord of Light, and therefore get killed by Brienne or die marching on Winterfell.

We all know that D&amp;D like to cut down on cast and sometimes incorporate minor characters into people we already know and love/hate. We also know that Arianne Martell is sadly, sadly not in the show. And neither is Arys Oakheart. And it seems very unlikely that they will introduce Darkstar at this point. On the other hand, what they have in their disposal is a bunch of mad-frothing Sand Snakes and everyones favourite LeBronn Jaime duo marching to the rescue.

It seems to me that Bronn and Jaime are going to take the role of Arianne's kindapping company and Sand Snakes will interfere with their attempt and scar Myrcella in the process, which will more or less bring us to the same point the books did, albeit by a different route. 

One more thing. In books the kidnapping was stopped by Doran's guards led by Areo Hotah, who slain Arys, saved Myrcella, sent Darkstar fleeing and captured Arianne. Hotah has been introduced in the show, but had no chance to demonstrate that his elaborately decorated glaive (which used to be a very simple axe in some other world) isn't just for show. So I believe he will stop the whole shebang in the show too. He will save Myrcella, capture Jaime, capture or chase away Sand Snakes and... he will kill Bronn. I really hope I'm wrong here as Bronn is one of my favourite show characters, but as far as we know he isn't vital to the plot, he isn't someone with blood ties or ""diplomatic immunity"" like Jaime and he just had this nice moment where he shared his plans to die of old age in his own castle.

However the sidearm used by Bronn bears an almost exact resemblance to the Kukri style blade used by Nepalese warriors over the last few centuries. The giveaway seems to be the notch at the base of the blade that is a signature of the Kukri style. They say that the notch helps prevent the handle from getting soaked in blood but others say it has ceremonial significance in Nepalese culture. I'm not sure if similar blades from outside of South Asia also have the notch but it does seem pretty characteristic. Here are a few screenshots of said blade.

""Its all unbelieveable because the sons of the harpy are just mooks with masks and daggers, and they're going up against some of the best trained fighters in the world""

I was under the impression that one of the main reasons why the sons of the harpy were so disgruntled was that the fighting pits were closed and Daenerys was refusing to reopen them. Therefore it stands to reason that the people in a calculated ambush to kill a patrol of unsullied were all experienced pit fighters, far from random mooks.

""The unsullied were never good at individual combat, true, but their strength came from group combat and formations, which were completely disregarded in this case with no explanation.""

What made the unsullied so formidable as trained killers was their brutal upbringing in Astapor, and the harsh training regimen they had to endure as a result. Is it so farfetched to consider that since Daenerys freed them and gave them free reign to do whatever they wanted, that maybe they neglected their training a tad? We're talking about a group that has been confirmed to go to brothels for cuddles on a regular basis, and remember that time their leader stayed up all night gambling with Daario Naharis? Not exactly the boot camp lifestyle they used to have. Is it so hard to believe that they had gotten a little rusty and it had terrible consequences? Also, how do you know the unsullied are as great as you say they are? Sure, their backgrounds are more fleshed out in the books with examples of their conquests, but we're talking about the show here; and have we ever actually seen any unsullied besides grey worm in any kind of battle prior to this point in the show (besides killing the masters in Astapor obviously)? Maybe the show unsullied just aren't quite as good as the book unsullied? Combine the ideas that the unsullied aren't quite as strong in the show as they are in the books, that they had gotten lax on their training and that this was quite possibly the first proper fight they've had in months, and that they were caught by surprise and outnumbered by a group of fighters who were more dangerous than they seemed, and suddenly their massacre doesn't seem quite so unbelievable.

""But Barristan's death was so unnecessary!""

Sure, they didn't HAVE to do it, but I can see why they did. Daenerys' storyline has been getting flack for being boring, as many people feel that she doesn't go through half as much conflict as the other characters. She just waltzes in with her dragons and gets a bunch of gold from Qarth and an army from Astapor and then another army from Yunkai, and nothing with long term bad consequences ever happens, except for the deaths of a few minor characters (and Drogo). By killing Barristan, they put the Sons of the harpy over as credible villains, so that we can actually take them seriously from now on and be invested in this storyline by making us want to see the sons of the harpy get their comeuppance; and they give Daenerys' storyline some much needed turmoil as well, to make her seem more sympathetic and well rounded instead of the bland Mary Sue she was turning into. I could be persuaded either way on this one to be honest, but i'm just pointing out that this decision is not as cut and dry as some are implying, theres pros and cons both ways.

""But Barristan had other cool scenes in the books that they'll never get around to now!""

Ten hours. They have Ten hours. As much as I like Barristan, there are other storylines in the books that may/may not have been cut that are far more impactful imo. Although once again, I see your point, and i'm already mad that they're going to be cutting aspects of the books out in favour of the inevitable Missandei/Grey Worm love scenes (ugh). But my point still stands, even if they cut out the Missandei/Grey worm scenes to fit in more book material, it probably wouldn't be Barristan stuff anyways when you consider the time constraints.

And for the biggest point...

""Thats such an unbelieveable and terrible way to kill off Barristan! We're talking about Barristan the Bold here! He was the best living fighter in westeros! Do you know how good they say he is in the books?! He should have killed all of those guys easily!""

For perspective, the only knight in GoT lore that was considered better than Barristan (by GRRM himself) was Ser Arthur Dayne.

Arthur Dayne died in a 3v7 battle against a handful of high lords, his allies were two other members of the kingsguard, 2 of the 7 men he fought survived the fight.

Barristan Selmy died in a 1v11 fight against trained pit fighters, he had far inferior armour and weaponry to Arthur Dayne, he was much older, and the only assistance he got was last minute interference by Grey worm killing the last harpy, all of the other 10 were killed by Barristan by himself.

Does Selmy's last stand still seem THAT unbelievable when you compare it to Arthur Dayne's? They made him look pretty fucking beastly in hindsight. It may not have been as dignified or honourable as Arthur Dayne's but since when do likable characters get honourable deaths in this show?

My only real gripe with the scene is why would they bother having that tease where the last harpy slitting Barristans throat is thwarted by Grey worm, if they were just gonna say he's dead anyway? But other than that, everything is easily explainable imo.

Ultimately, I think there will be a similar conclusion to the books: when trying to help Myrcella escape Dorne someone will betray and maim her. That someone will shortly thereafter be killed.

Is there a reason this person couldn't be Bronn? As much as we've grown attached to him, he's not someone who is supposed to be so significant to the shows and can't possibly continue to be such a major player. Bronn has also made it clear he is a mercenary and as witty as he is, he's always been fighting for the highest bidder. Perhaps the Sand Snakes will get to him and he'll take a shot at killing Myrcella. He'll maim her but then Jamie will kill him.

Some other thoughts:

* The discussion around how they'd like to die was foreshadowing of Bronn's death in battle.
* Bronn's attitude of Jamie's inability to fight with one hand will certainly add to it.
* Myrcella will have to be maimed since it has the potential to start a war between the Lannister's and the Martell's in the books.
* The death of Aerys Oakheart which could be replaced by Bronn's death in a way.

So towards the end of the books, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont don't make it to Daenerys and instead start working together to amass her group of mercenaries while she hangs out with Drogon.

#Congratulations everyone on reaching HALF A MILLION subscribers!

The subreddit is getting an update today that includes a sidebar rework and a variety of small bug fixes.  The bug fixes handle a few small display issues, and they address the changes to Reddit's overall framework that happened a few months ago that broke some of the CSS markup references.  Reddit supports CSS3 fairly well now, and you may notice more modern CSS tricks in the sub going forward.  There are a few more tweaks/features coming that are not fully tested yet.  They should be posted later this week.

Over the years we've tried a variety of ways to present information in the sidebar, including moving some of the important links into the header.  This update essentially simplifies and compresses the sidebar, and then it's outright moved down to make space for the true important links you need at the top.  The flaming Lightbringer sword has been lost for now; it just took up too much room.  But it will return later in some form if the opportunity arises.

And with this update we have more **new username flair options!**  The first 20 are already online and available:

All the deaths, all of the stuff that happens, George doesn't make it happen.

Instead, George is playing multiple RPG/D&amp;D campaigns with himself. He's controlling characters and he attempts to make them do something, but the true outcome is determined *by the dice*. George just fleshes out the world around it.

For instance: Ned Stark.

He's the main character, looking into the Lannisters and the true heir, but oops he rolled low and got caught out, sent to jail.  
He's about at the Executioner's Block and all he has to do is say he'll go to Castle Black and carry on his life there *Oops, critical 1, Joffrey rolls a 20 on his dick-roll*. George is thinking ""Fuck, I just killed the main character, oh well, carry on with the campaign...""

Battle of Blackwater? Red Wedding? Mountain Vs Red Viper? Hound Vs Brienne? All determined by the dice rolls. 

This is why (almost) nobody has plot armour, their lives are in the dice. George just fleshes out the story around it.

Feel free to add as I'm sure I'll miss a few.  I've included some examples as well as possible theoretical ones:

1. Whenever a character talks about returning at a later date (esp. to tell another character something important)(i.e. Ned and Jon, Sansa and Littlefinger?)
2. When we learn more about a character, esp. when little backstory has been given previously (Brienne?)
3. Characters mentoring/training another character (i.e. former Lord Commander Mormont and Jon Snow, Brienne and Pod?)
4. A character talks about going somewhere in the future, esp. if it's somewhere they want to go (i.e. Talisa talking about going back home to Volantis to see her parents and show off their soon-to-be child)
5. Something ""happy"" happens or is expected to happen in the near future (i.e. Robb &amp; Talisa being married/expecting a baby).
6. Characters bonding with another one (Stannis and Shireen should probably be watching out for this)
7. Injury received (i.e. Drogo, The Hound?)",6,5,False,self,,,,,

One of the many(mostly book readers) complaints about Daenarys' storyline is that it isn't really interesting or compelling. I think the reason for that is that there are hardly any important character deaths. The last memorable character that died in Daenarys' storyline is [E1.10] (#s ""Khal drogo and that was way the heck back in season 1!"")

It's the same way in the books too, there are hardly any major characters dying off. I remember a character in [ADWD] (#b ""Where Strong Belwas eats a bunch of poisoned crickets and still doesn't die."")

All the wildfire has gone and there is no Tywin to protect the city this time. Varys and Petyr have done a runner because they know what's coming. Surprise surprise, Tyrion is out of the way.

Knowing the bank's reputation, they always get what they want. Either they get Cersei or Margaery's third husband, or both. At some point to conclude everything, a man from Braavos will repeat the line ""a Lannister always pays their debts"".

It turns out however (in one of the more popular reveals of the series) that he is actually a very shrewd and intelligent lord who successfully uses this oafish facade to outmaneuver or outplay his political opponents without arousing suspicion.

We know at this point that Manderly is most likely not going to be in the show, however there is another character who seems to fit this mold and is becoming more and more prominent as the series goes on: Mace Tyrell.

Does anyone think that the show is building up to a Manderly type reveal in which Mace does a full 180 (perhaps after Cersei gets arrested) and becomes a major player? In my mind this would be a fantastic reveal and further highlight that Cersei's arrogance makes her totally blind to peoples motivations and loyalties.

At the moment I can totally see it going both ways. The show does like to merge characters and traits and show!Mace does seem to be just a little bit *too* Winnie the Poo at the moment, but I guess he could just be there to highlight Cersei's incompetent/corrupt small council.

[1]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/352ca7/all_spoilers_how_much_time_has_passed_and_what/,nietzscheispietzsche,1430924174,"So, I've seen the first question answered once or twice with an estimated one and a half to two years passing from say, the first episode until the present. But that's crazy when you think about it; Dany brought a baby near to term in the first season (depending on whether the whole deal with the devil thing was an early birth or whatnot) and Tommen has aged like 6-7 years (I know there's a huge diff between his show age and book age but even so, I'd say more than 2 years have passed). 

This brings me to the larger question: What the hell is a year in this universe anyway? Years on Earth are based on the consistent rotation of seasons; one trip through each season equals a year. But in the ASOIF universe, summer and winter are variable lengths and can last years at a time[2]. So what the hell is a year, then? From what I can remember in the books, something something the maesters get together and determine that a year has passed, or that winter is upon us. But wouldn't that make a year's time completely arbitrary and inconsistent? Why would we expect that their conception of a year would be anywhere close to ours? Is this just a leap I'm supposed to take?

Fn. 1: I put all spoilers just in case they might be necessary to explain this question.

Fn. 2: Let's forget the implications this has for the larger ASOIF solar system (why hasnt Neil Degrasse Tyson weighed in on this?)

* **Tommen:** Tywin's speech to Tommen was all about how a good king listens to his advisers on matters he knows nothing about. He said as much to Joffrey when he was alive. Now that Tywin is dead we're seeing the huge impact his steadying hand as king is having on Tommen. Sure, Tywin had to go, Tyrion didn't really have a choice... but it seems selfish in a way that Tyrion killed him knowing that it meant disaster for King's Landing, the Lannisters and Tommen in particular. Tommen is struggling a ton without his grandfather around. 

* **Cersei:** She's drinking more, and is losing Lannister control. Maybe Tywin was a control freak, maybe he's a misogynist... but for whatever reason he didn't teach Cersei shit about how to be a ruler. She's completely out of her depth and making insane decisions like arming the Faith Militant and attacking the Tyrells. 

* **Jaime:** This whole plan to ""rescue"" Princess Myrcella is completely insane. Jamie is smart enough to know that he can't have the kingdoms go to war with Dorne... but not smart enough to realize that Cersei is playing him and sending him on an insane mission. I get that Jamie doesn't want to rule, but Tywin would never have allowed this crazy mission to Dorne to happen. He would have Jamie helping to strengthen the family's position. 

* **Daenerys:** With Ser Jorah exiled and Ser Barristan presumed dead... her most experienced advisers are a eunuch bred for battle (who might also be dead) and a meathead who was raised in the fighting pits. She is the Queen with no council, no experience with her family or with how to rule and no one to keep her grounded with tales of the Mad King. She's adrift. 

* **Jon:** Lord Commander Snow has shown that he's an intelligent commander when called upon, but he's still inexperienced. The Bear was killed at the mutiny and Snow's only real grounding influence is Sam. 

It seems that the sage, and grounding influences of the main character's mentors is gone which could form a cohesive moral that brings season 5 to a close.",8,9,False,self,,,,,

And after thinking through it thoroughly, here are the main points to support it:

1- The Dothraki live in Essos. Islam was started in the Arab peninsula, a region that was historically considered part of ""the East"". It's today a component of the Middle East.

2- The leader of the Dothraki is a **Khal**. The leader of Muslims in old ages was a ""**Khal**ifa"". Furthermore, whenever the Dothraki Khal is weakened and deemed unworthy of ruling, his people immediately overthrow him. The same happened to Muslim Khalifas.

3- Remember the holy Dothraki tent where Drogo killed Viserys Targaryan? As someone who grew up in a Muslim-majority country (I'm an atheist, though), I find this very similar to *Kaaba*, Muslim's most sacred place of worship. Bloodshed and Fighting is disallowed in both places.

4- After killing Viserys, Drogo promised to bring the false gods of Westeros to Vaes Dothrak, the Dothraki version of *Mecca*, and destroy them there. Muhammed did the same to the old Arab gods.

5- Dothraki is a harsh, guttural language. As a native Arabic speaker, I find classic Arabic (the language that was spoken when Islam started) very similar in terms of difficulty and being not-so-user-friendly.

6- The Dothraki are dependant on their horses. Old Arabs valued their horses just as much, it can be seen everywhere in poetry glorifying their horses' strengths during battles and travels. Today, ""Arabian horses"" are some of the best and most expensive ones.

7- The Dothraki never crossed the Narrow Sea. In a sense, the spread of Islam was also limited by water surfaces. Muslims were able to cross the Mediterranean and invade Spain, but they failed to establish any significant existence in Europe. 

8- The Dothraki are savages. Muslims were also savages, I'm afraid. They fought like wild monsters and committed massive war crimes. They also, more or less, took women as slaves. Muhammed himself married an Egyptian slave called Mariya. Wikipedia says she ""was an Egyptian Coptic Bondswoman who was gifted to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 628 by Muqawqis the Copt"" in order to convince him not to invade Egypt.

9- The Dothraki lead a tribal life, with actually no established cities. Same did ancient Arab tribes.

10- The Dothraki believe they'll one day unite the entire world into a single Khalasar. That's one of Muslim beliefs as well. They wanted to impose their religion by force.

11- In the background noise that's played in a Dothraki scene in one of the early S1 episodes, I can unmistakenly hear the phrase ""As-salamu alaykum"", which is the Islamic greeting. My other family members confirmed this as well. I wonder if it's a mere coincidence.

Since they've added the ""Previously On Game of Thrones"" segment, as well as the ""behind the scenes"" portion at the end, the episodes are shorter than the previous seasons that were 55 minutes. This week's episode, for example, didn't start until 2m45s in and the end credits finished at 53m05s. That means we're only getting 50m20s worth of content. Multiply that amount times 10 episodes in the season, and we're missing out on nearly a WHOLE EPISODE worth of content.

How they have set her lines up in episode 3 that she is going to kill him.

Would that be some foreshadowing?

But the Question is how? 

She is already in the north, and following Sansa, she knows Sansa is heading to Winterfell and means to follow her.

Stannis is marching out to Winterfell from The Wall presumably episode 5.
Roose is at Winterfell and getting ready for Stannis' attack (Trailers) and he already knows Brienne. Do you think that once Stannis sieges Winterfell, and the battle ensues, that Brienne will be fighting for Roose against Stannis' army, to try and get her revenge. 

She meets Stannis on the battlefield and eventually kills him?

Well you might have also noticed the look on LF's face that said ""I know more about this than I'm telling you,"" when Sansa says Rhaegar kidnapped and raped Lyanna. I propose that not only did LF know what really went down between Rhaegar and Lyanna, he may have witnessed it, and possibly even provoked Brandon's response by informing him. The question of course is how would he know a story any different than the rest of Westeros?

   I believe that LF might have had a chance encounter with Rhaegar and Lyanna somewhere on their journey from Winterfell to Dorne. As far as we know LF didn't spend any time at court during the reign of the Targs and had no knowledge or interest in the prophecy that likely lead Rhaegar to kidnap/elope with Lyanna and most likely he had never even met Rhaegar. Now we don't have an exact timeline of events in the Rebellion, but we do know that from the tournament at Harrenhal to the Tower of Joy is a period of less than two years. I'm unsure if Petyr's duel with Brandon occurred before or after the tournament, but if you buy into the theory that the tournament was a front for the great lords to meet and plan to overthrow Aerys, then it would make sense that the duel would've taken place after the tournament because the marriage proposal likely would have been made at the tourney as part of the rebellion plans. Either way, Petyr would've eventually seen Rhaegar's love for Lyanna as an avenue for revenge against the Starks.

   Its unclear exactly when Petyr left Riverrun, but we know that he was bedridden for two weeks after the duel while Lysa helped nurse(and fuck) him back to health, and according to one timeline he was sent away after that. Now, in order for Petyr to cross paths with Rhaegar and/or Lyanna, we have to make a few assumptions about timing. First, we know that Brandon left Riverrun to meet his fathers wedding party on their way from Winterfell, and soon found out about Lyannas kidnapping and changed course to head to Kings Landing. This suggests that Lyannas abduction happened immediately after Rickard and co. left Winterfell, as it doesnt seem that Rickard knew Lyanna was missing. Now we can reasonably assume that Rickard Starks wedding party was quite large and wouldve included most of his household based on the size of weddings weve seen in the show and that this was a marriage between two great houses during peacetime. We also know that parties of this size that are in no rush take some time to move that distance, based on Roberts party taking a month to travel from KL to WF. So its possible that Rhaegar could have arrived at Winterfell by taking a route off the Kingsroad, abducted Lyanna, and rode south taking the same alternate route and passed Rickards party without them knowing, seeing as two people riding south in a hurry would likely travel faster than a wedding party. We know that Petyr left Riverrun two weeks after the duel and he most likely wouldve been heading home to the Fingers, directly east along the river road and he likely wouldve stopped at the crossroads inn. Petyrs stay at the inn wouldve been a day or two after departing Riverrun, and by this time Brandon wouldve met his fathers party somewhere along the kingsroad. If you accept the fact that by the time Brandon met Rickards party Lyanna had already been kidnapped and left Winterfell, then its well possible that Lyanna and Rhaegar wouldve stopped at the same inn as Petyr at the same time. This becomes even more plausible if youre willing to believe that either Lyanna and Rhaegar, Petyr, or both stayed more than one night which would give them a bigger window to meet each other. If you can accept that all of these events line up with the right timing, its actually pretty likely that Petyr would cross paths with Rhaegar and Lyanna. Petyr would know what both of them looked like because he had recently seen them at Harrenhal, so lets say one night Petyr is sitting by himself at the inn, perhaps having a drink and mulling over the beating that Brandon had just given him and bearing a fresh scar from the duel, perhaps already thinking about ways to get back at Brandon and the Starks, and just then he notices two travelers walk in seeking a place to stay. Maybe at first they only look vaguely familiar to him, and maybe Rhaegar even has his hair dyed to conceal his identity, but eventually Petyr realizes who hes looking at. On this day he stopped being the nave young Petyr Baelish and became the scheming bastard known as Littlefinger. At this point LF wouldve known that Lyanna should be heading to Riverrun with her family to attend her brothers wedding, not heading south with prince Rhaegar. Its possible that he overheard their plans to head to Dorne but what he knew or didnt know actually isnt important to this theory. Upon seeing Brandon Starks sister with a man who has very recently displayed interest in her, LF likely realized that the two were running of together, or at least that he could convince Brandon that they were. Knowing that Brandon is on his way to Riverrun, LF couldve sought out a rider to send an anonymous message to Brandon saying that he saw Lyanna with Rhaegar heading south. Whether or not LF knew their plans or even knew or said in the letter if it was a kidnapping is irrelevant, he knows Brandon will assume the worst and act rashly, incurring the wrath of the Mad King. Its also likely that LF didnt really care or think too much about the consequences as long as the Starks suffered.

   When you look carefully at the situation its almost necessary that someone had to tell Brandon that Rhaegar had kidnapped Lyanna and its entirely possible that someone was Littlefinger. First, how else would he have known that it was Rhaegar who kidnapped his sister? Someone at Winterfell simply noticing her absence wouldnt be enough to implicate Rhaegar. Second, theres almost no way that anyone in the Tully or Stark camp told Brandon because both Rickard and Hoster were unaware of the kidnapping and on top of that both of them wanted Brandon to continue on to Riverrun when they did find out. In addition to the feelings of the lords involved, we know that Brandon didnt find out about the kidnapping immediately when he met his fathers party on the road, so that makes it even more likely that a rider from somewhere met the party and told Brandon. Third, no one we know of other than LF wouldve had motivation to tell Brandon about the kidnapping before his wedding, because anyone familiar enough with the Starks to recognize Lyanna wouldve probably been at Riverrun or on the way there, and those that werent there wouldnt have been on the road where Rhaegar and Lyanna wouldve been, and those same people familiar with the Starks wouldve known that telling Brandon his sister had been kidnapped wouldve known his temper would lead him to do something crazy like ride straight to Kings Landing and threaten the crown prince in front of an insane king. Basically anyone else who wouldve recognized Lyanna running away/being kidnapped wouldnt have been around to see her doing that and even if they were they would know that telling him would cause him to take a detour from his wedding and piss off Lord Rickard. It doesnt seem like Rhaegars plan was well known around court. Jaime Lannister certainly never mentions knowing about it and he was constantly around the royal family. If Varys knew Rhaegars intentions its likely he wouldve tried to stop him as he only ever wanted to keep peace in the realm. On top of all this we know that LF isnt above throwing the realm into chaos to serve his own ends, he starts the war of the five kings without much thought at all.

   To sum it up, Littlefinger sees Rhaegar and Lyanna together at the inn at the crossroads on his way home to the Fingers from Riverrun and sees and opportunity for revenge against Brandon only weeks after he defeats him in a duel. LF recognizes Lyanna and Rhaegar because he had seen them at the tournament at Harrenhal earlier in the year. Littlefinger sends an anonymous message with a rider to Brandon while he is on the road to Riverrun knowing it will enrage him and cause him to do something stupid. Brandon does exactly that and gets himself(and a lot of others) killed and LF has his revenge.",41,54,False,self,,,,,

**Me:** She is the ""Red Woman"". She is a priestess of the Lord of Light. Remember we talked about him? Stanis, the dead king's brother, has turned to the Lord of Light. And her name is Melisandre.

With Ned it was when he decided to lie and proclaim Joffrey as the king that he gets his head cut off. For Robb it was when he married someone other than whom he was betrothed to he gets murdered by the offended family. So if Jon forsakes his vows with the Night's Watch, then it would follow that he would die shortly after. But it seems from all of his dialogue that he will remain at the Wall.

Or when the Mountain's body starts shaking on the table in his office and he just shushes it without flinching.  He obviously knows his stuff too, like when he cleaned out Jamie's stump.

I am assuming Varys would have to know by the time he got to Illyrio's that his man inside got exiled and what for, so my question is what how does he expect to have Dany just let him in? I mean, she knows that Varys was the one giving info to Robert and in turn an assassin was sent to poison her with wine. Is this just a bridge he expects to cross later or what?

He has the heirs to two of the seven kingdom in his custody, is ruling the Vale until Robin comes of age, and he gets to be creepy with mini-cat as much as he wants. So what does one of two supposed smartest and most clever men in the seven kingdoms do? He immediately dumps Robin and his key to ruling the Vale on Bronze Yohn Royce, who literally told Littlefinger to his face last season that he hates him. Straight up. Not really sure where he was going with that one. [AFFC](#b ""Now in the books this makes sense because hes planning to slowly murder Robin and replace him with Harry the Heir, who hell marry to Sansa and use them to claim both the North and the Vale. Coupled with the fact that hes already Lord Paramount of the Trident means that hed be one of the most powerful lords in the seven kingdoms. But in the show Harry doesnt exist and hes not Lord Paramount of the Trident."")  At this point Petyr hasnt really spent much time with Robin and hasnt had a chance to shape him in the same way he has shaped Sansa into someone he can use to rule. By giving him up and leaving the Vale he loses his ability to rule the Vale in the present as Lord Protector and in the future through influencing Robin. But at this point in the show I was willing to him the benefit of the doubt. After all, this is Petyr fucking Baelish. He has been playing the long con since before the show started. Im sure this is all part of his dope master plan to get even more power. Until he said he was planning to marry Sansa to Ramsay Bolton. Lets make a pros and cons list for both sides on this. So for the Boltons they get this sweet deal where they get the one thing they needed to hold the North, a Stark, which Roose even says without they cant possibly rule. In exchange for literally the thing in the world that the Boltons wanted more then anything else, even more than they want to flay stuff, Petyr gets what? He loses his most valuable asset in Sansa Stark who only retains value if she can be married and before she has a son. And if what he says is true its all because of some convoluted plan to have her be named Wardness of the North when Stannis takes Winterfell. But why would he do that? If Stannis the mannis takes Winterfell and kills all the Boltons why wouldnt he just have Sansa marry one of his knights or Bannermen to rule the North in his name. The North wouldnt care, they seem to be cool with the Boltons when they had Sansa. And if the Boltons win and if Sansa can somehow control the Joffrey 2.0 that is Ramsay its still not clear what he gets out of it as with actual winter coming the North is not going to be able to do much So to summarize at this point Little finger has ditched the Vale, had his stepson and Lord of the Vale fostered with people that hate him, and given away his mac piece and key to the North to a psychopath with the intent of that psychopath being murdered by another dude that hates him before heading back to kings landing. Oh, and everyone keeps fucking up his brothel.

Khrazz came.
&gt; For the first time all day, Selmy felt certain. This is what I was made for, he thought. The dance, the sweet steel song, a sword in my hand and a foe before me.

I know Im late arriving to the discussion but I would like to talk about the surprising death of the bold, storied knight that has muddied the waters of his valiant tale. When he was removed from the story on screen but not on the page, Barristan was put into a constant state of dual existence. I have come to call it Martins Knight (in the style of Schrdingers Cat) and, much like that theoretical cat, until I open the book in which the words are written that tell the tale of Ser Barristan Selmys death I wont be able to consider him truly dead.

In a television saga fraught with loss, this loss hit the harder. As the season premier approached we saw the teaser scenes showing frames of Barristan in the streets of Meereen, standing ready, longsword grasped and deadly. Barristans words from the passage above flew to the front of my mind and I was ready for his foes to fall to his steel like so many others. When the screen faded to black and the credits rolled this past Sunday, I was stunned and didnt know how to feel. I knew I should have been mad. Mad at the showrunners for taking one of the remaining characters who, much like Eddard Stark, held fast to his values. Mad at George Martin for not making abso-fucking-lutley sure that Ser Barristan still drew breath for at least another season. 

But I wasnt. I couldnt be. Barristan died the way he lived, with sword in hand, defending his queen and the peace of her realm. I think I was so stunned because, after reading all of the *A Song of Ice and Fire* writings, I wasnt sure Barristan *could* die. But after witnessing Ned, Catlyn, Robb, Oberyn and many more fall to the keystrokes of George, I realized something. While the narrative contains objects of a fantasy world, the human nature of that world is anything but fantastical. Actions of characters have consequences and people who refuse to bend will often break under the weight of their ideology and thus, anyone could die. In his own POV chapter of A Dance With Dragons , Selmy took on his single foe clad in plate and mail and the knowledge there was a fight ahead, while Barristan in the show simply reacted while on a stroll, unarmored and unaware he was outnumbered. Similar to another young dragon he once served, Barristan acted courageously, Barristan fought bravely and Barristan died.

The tale of Ser Barristan The Bold Selmy is one I have always day-dreamt about and one I was eager to learn more of. And now that it has come to a close in one medium, I find myself confused. I am sad and satisfied for his dying doing what he was born to do but also elated and eager to know what way Martin will attempt to give him the send-off he deserves. On a coin, heads means Barristan is truly alive and tails, he is absolutely dead. When flipped, the coin will always land on its edge, only to fall when this great knight does in print. 

TL;DR: While saddening, Barristans TV death was a matter of logical reactions and places me in a place of confused contentment until he dies in the books.

Westeros= Giant version of England and possibly Western Europe?

Dorne= I know it's not Medieval, but it really makes me think of New Orleans, in the sense that it's part of Westeros, but it has a unique cultural, legal system and dialect because it was founded by a separate culture.  (Are the Dornishmen originally from Essos?)  The whole ""Dornishmen fuck goats"" stereotype makes them sound like hicks, but so far they seem cosmopolitan.

Essos= A combination of the Middle East, Central Asia and the Mediterranean?  So, maybe the Byzantine Empire.

Braavos=Italy and Spain? The Iron Bank reminds me of the Medici city-state. 

Meereen=  Alexandria?  Constantinople?  Mecca?  I have no idea.

Andals= A combination of the Romans and the Normans

North Men=Anglo Saxons

First Men= Germanic/ Scandinavian tribes, or maybe Celts

Freefolk= The Celtic tribes ""above"" Hadrian's Wall, like the Picts

Dothraki= A combination of the Mongols and the Huns (and the Apache, sort of)

And the more I think about it, the more that I want to discuss it with people that are more passionate about ASOIAF than the people on my Facebook account, and I'd like to get some input from said people. So here is the post in it's entirety, and maybe some of you could help me out with my confusion.... 

Okay, (spoilers the last episode of Game of Thrones, I guess) I can't be the only one confused about Game of Thrones this season, can I? Yeah, I read the books, which in many people's minds makes my arguments about the show invalid, but what was the point of TV Cersei making the High Sparrow High Septon? Yeah, the old High Septon was a a blasphemer, but he was already in the pocket of the Lannisters. And not for nothing, but Cersei has three illegitimate children with her twin fucking brother, and being that incest is frowned upon in the Faith of the Seven, I don't think that piety is that high on her list of priorities. And now, on this week's episode, she re-establishes the Faith Militant, which had been outlawed for three centuries (BY A KING WHO DISLIKED THEM FOR THE SOUL REASON THAT HE HIMSELF WAS OPENLY ENGAGED IN AN INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP!!!!1!!!1!!ONE!!!), and why? Because she wanted an excuse to imprison Ser Loras for being gay, on account of she doesn't like the Tyrells... Couldn't she have found an easier way to do that?
Now don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of Cersei Lannister or her aptitude for governance, but while she isn't the smartest broad in the Seven Kingdoms, she's also not literally fucking retarded. If she wanted get under Queen Margery's skin by doing away with Ser Loras (which she DID in the books as well) she wouldn't have done so by establishing a fully autonomous militia with the power to eradicate her entire family. She is the Queen Regent, which for anyone that is unaware of the laws of Westeros, pretty much makes her the most powerful woman in the whole wide world. Now yes, in the books she also re-establsihed the Faith Militant, but in that iteration of the story, she really didn't have much of a choice, AND she didn't depose the former High Septon, as the Crown has no say in the affairs of the Faith. And also not for nothing, but as much as a shrewd heartless bitch as Cersei appears to be, her one redeeming quality is that she loves her children more than anything in the world. On this week's episode she sends King Tommen, her last living son, to confront the high Septon armed with nothing more than a few Kingsguard against a LITERAL army of people who could easily murder him with no repercussions whatsoever.

It'd make sense, seeing how sending untrained soft-handed men against the Unsullied is both suicidal and dumb when there's a class of resentful trained killers just sitting around.

This would mean that he didn't kill a bunch of nobles before falling, but instead slaughtered a huge portion of the best killers in the city before being struck down, which is much more badass.

Most people seem to be of the opinion that the Unsullied underperformed compared to their supposed skill level and the same could be said for Selmy where as the Sons of the Harpy are just a bunch of untrained people with daggers who somehow managed to beat the Unsullied and the great Barristan Selmy.

I'm going to explain why I think a) The Sons of the Harpy are not just a bunch of untrained people in masks, b) the Unsullied performed exactly as I would expect and c) Barristan Selmy fought as well as could be expected from anyone. 

First the contention that the Sons of the Harpy are just random dudes with daggers and no training and they shouldn't have been able to kill the Unsullied as easily as they did.  First off I think that the SOH are not untrained.  I believe they are mostly comprised of pit fighters.  There are no slaves any longer but there are still tons of people clamoring for Danny to open the fighting pits again.  The SOH only appeared when she refused.  It would seem to me that pit fighters who generally fight with a myriad of weapons and armor in confined spaces would be best suited for the ambushes we see in the show and likely comprise the majority of the SOH we see attacking the Unsullied.  Also as pit fighters, as Daario mentioned, they would fight using all sorts of different styles and tactics.  This would make them very difficult for people to fight against because they would be very unpredictable.  Not necessarily that all SOH are pit fighters, simply that they used pit fighters as the main assault force when ambushing Unsullied patrols.


As for the Unsullied and why they underperformed exactly as I would expect.  When we first see the Unsullied they are basically a robot army.  They have no real names.  They are not allowed to live anything resembling a real life.  They have been purged of all humanity to basically make them fighting machines.  But after Danny takes them on she removes from them all the things that made them the super tough warriors they were.  They were no longer simply fighting machines.  They were allowed to have names, and feelings, and free time which they apparently use to sometimes frequent brothels.  In short they do not live or act like Unsullied any longer because they have been humanized.  That has resulted in the decline of their fighting skills as they become softer men.  They are not useless by any means but if you watch the multiple ambushes you see they mostly traveled in groups of 2-6 which get easily outnumbered and surrounded by their ambushers.  Why did they use spears and not swords, why did they not travel in larger groups, why did they not fight better like we know they should?  All that can be chalked up to the fact that Danny in allowing them to be more human has made them less Unsullied.

Barristan the bold.  Like a lot of people I was really bummed by the very very end of the episode but not because I thought he underperformed just because he dies.  In the books Ned has a dream about when he and 6 of his captains went to rescue his sister at the Tower of Joy.  There he encounters 3 kingsguard including Arthur Dayne supposedly the greatest swordsman in the realm.  Ned and 1 captain lived and everyone else including the 3 KG were killed.

So you have an instance where the greatest swordsman in the realm, with his armor and 2 other great swordsmen all in their primes were defeated in combat when outnumbered only 2-1 by opponents who were skilled but less so than the KG supposedly were.  With that in mind does it really seem so unlikely that an aged Selmy, who is without armor or backup is eventually beaten by the SOH when he is outnumbered at least 15 or 20 -1?  And he did manage to kill 14 before his end.  If I am honest I feel like that is a great display of his legendary skill.  But he was still beyond his prime and in serving Danny he probably didn't practice as much as he likely did when wearing the white cloak.  I don't know if it was just the costume or makeup or what but it also kind of looked like Selmy wasn't in quite as good a shape as he was when he was on the KG.  So again I have to say that all things considered I think that Selmy fought as well as anyone could realistically hope.

so tldr;

The SOH are not untrained randoms, they are actually mostly pit fighters which is why they were able to fight the Unsullied and Barristan so effectively.  The Unsullied have grown weaker under Danny because she treats them like humans which is why they are not as effective when they get ambushed by the SOH.  And Barristan actually performed better than people realize because he was old, likely not as practiced as he used to be, was unarmored and without backup and still manged to kill 14 SOH, who again are likely comprised of pit fighters, before finally being killed.

That being said I am still **SUPER** bummed that we only really got a small taste of the great sword prowess of Barristan and I agree with everyone that the Sand Snakes scene was horrible.",22,18,False,self,,,,,

The witch tells Cersei that she would be Queen for a time until a younger more beautiful queen comes along and take everything that she holds dear. 

Eventually Cersei believes this new queen may be Maergery Tyrell but I think that is too obvious.

At the end of season four we see Sansa change from a girl to a woman and little finger begins to teach her about the game of thrones, how to spot weakness and exploit for gain. As she learns to observe you quickly get the idea that she is changing and Baelish makes hints about vengeance. I speculate that the younger more beautiful queen may perhaps be Sansa instead of the obvious Maergery or Danny. Baelish makes a marriage pact with the Bolton's and the North made it clear they wanted a separate monarchy again. No body said this queen had to sit the iron throne.

I theorise that Sansa will grow into her back bone and seek revenge, perhaps Ramsay will help her because he would have had to have some love for the Stark's to do what he did to Theon after he claimed to have killed Bran and Rickon.

So far sweet moment don't come without consequences :/
I have actually went back and watched a few episodes. One episode in season 4 I believe (I'll update the exact later) the red lady showed Stannis' wife a vision in the fire because she ""didn't need tricks to see the truth however harsh it may be"" RIGHT AFTER the wife said she thought bringing their daughter, shireen, would be ""ill advised"". The red lady also said ""there's power in the king's blood"".
With what they were planning to do with King Robert's bastard... I fear the red lady is going to want to sacrifice Shireen.

Enjoy.
----
I propose a hard science-fiction explanation:

The world of GoT is a multi-generation interstellar colony ship, built from a hollowed-out planetoid or mobile Dyson sphere. It has been in transit for millennia, and, as these stories draw to a close, the vessel is almost at journey's end. In such an environment, we would place an artificial star in its center, and would rotate the structure about its equator to create gravity on its inner surface. We would stock it with a self-sustaining biome sufficient to support a population with a fixed rate of births and deaths, and provide a transparent system of caretaker agencies to prevent Malthusian catastrophes. 

In fact, the most critical factor for the success of such a colony mission would be the safe delivery of a large, genetically diverse and healthy population of humans to the destination world. But how do you ensure Malthus does not rear his head through uncontrolled technological growth and self-destruction, or uncontrolled population growth and starvation? Further, how do you do this when you can't explain the situation to the thousands of generations who will live between the embarking and disembarking? What does it matter to them, when their entire purpose is simply to act as a temporary genetic vessel? And yet, the builders of this ship must maintain a steady state. I theorize that the two main forms this caretaker system takes are 1) ""Magic"" and 2) Weather Control. 

""Magic"" 

Consider for a moment why the GoT world has not had a significant advance in technology in ten thousand years, that we have iron-age tools and medicine and architecture. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. If there is no necessity, there is no invention. Why is there no necessity? Because mystical crap just makes things happen. As Arthur Clarke famously says, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" - A civilization that could engineer a mobile Dyson Sphere is likely to be one that has progressed past a technological singularity, and thus, would have a large number of tricks up their sleeve to affecting changes in the material world that violated the conventional notions of cause and effect. In practice, there's no need to create airplanes when you have {genetically engineered} dragons. No need to build large earthmoving equipment or advanced architecture when you can cast a {nanotech strengthening} spell on a structure. No need to create advanced weapons when you can directly control the elements against your enemies. The examples are legion. 

Weather Control

When does winter happen? Usually when there's lots of people alive. When does winter end? When a lot of them have died. Winter is an extreme corrective action, but very effective. All that's required is to decrease the output of the artificial star and watch the results. It has the added effect of creating a selective evolutionary pressure that allows the surviving stock to be more hardy for the eventual colonization effort that will be required upon landfall. 

My prediction is that, at the end of these stories, we will see people descend into a dark staircase set into the ground, and after a long journey, arrive in a room with a glass floor that shows the shining limb of a new world, in orbit far below.",14,14,False,self,,,,,

Last season we had Selyse wanting to leave Shireen at Dragonstone, but Mel showed Selyse that Shireen had a role yet to play and the two of them looked lovingly, err menacingly, into a fire. This season Selyse behaves like a lunatic (that is to say normally,) and complains that she can't make boy babies and that her daughter is the worst. As she's making her case for Westeros's worst parent Mel walks up and says ""Yeah but she's got Stannis's blood, oh and Stannis is a king, oh yeah and I almost burned a guy I knew had king's blood."" Then last episode we get Stannis trying his hand at acting by saying he cares about his darling princess daughter. Shireen is doomed as fuck.

I guess the important question would be why? I think there's really only two answers. I think it's extremely possible that Brienne and Stannis will fight, and if that happens Brienne will probably kill Stannis. This would explain Selyse crying on the ground as seen on the season trailer. If Stannis is dead, Mel may burn Shireen to revive him. What I think is more probable, though, is [ADWD](#s ""Jon gets ""for the Watch'd"" and Mel burns Shireen to revive him."")",7,5,False,self,,,,,

So, I didn't want to just come to the subreddit and start yelling hate until I had had time to ""let it breath"". The Red Wedding. It's a commonly spoken up subject in the series. I wanted to know if anyone else saw it quite like I did.

Robb Stark is a straight up asshat. Pardon me, I just had to get that off my chest. He lead his own Mother to her death because he had to be his ""Own Man"". For 2 seasons he waltzed around the North thinking he could do whatever he wanted to do because he was Ned's son.
""I can break whatever vows I took, I don't have to work with the Karstarks, I can do whatever I want. I'm Ned Stark's son."" That's how I felt his entire reign as ""King"" of the North went. She warned him, and played the role of a good mother and followed her son through thick and thin. And she died because of it.

That, to me, was the most tragic part of the whole ordeal. That in the end, Catelyn believed her two youngest sons were dead, and her daughters were in the hands of the most vile people in all of the Seven Kingdoms. She lost her beloved husband. Her home was burned to the ground. And her future grandchild, and her eldest, and to her belief, only remaining son was murdered right in front of her. And he lead her right into it. 

TL;DR - Robb Stark is a dickbag.

Did anyone else feel the same way?

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but maybe this is foreshadowing something to do with Ser Davos. As much as I would hate for it to happen, Davos might be in some serious danger when Stannis' army rides for Winterfell.",13,14,False,self,,,,,

I haven't searched this idea too widely for fear of spoilers. I wonder if it has been stated before and what people think about it. GRRM had been pretty clear (until recently) that there would be seven books. How would he know? Why would he structure it that way?

My theory is that each volume was intended as a reflection of an aspect of the Many-Faced God and was linked to the development of a character (or perhaps, characters). Both the books and the aspects of the Many-Faced God have a canonical order. So we can align those. Then, there seem to be strong (+) and weak (-) versions of the archetype

AGOT : The Father : Ned Stark (+) and Robert Baratheon (-)  
ACOK : The Mother : Daenerys Targaryen (+) and Catelyn Stark (-)

ASOS : The Warrior : Brienne Tarth (+) and Jaime Lannister (-)  
AFFC : The Maiden : Arya Stark (+) and Asha Greyjoy (-)

I think it's telling that in ASOS, Tyrion never ranks as a warrior -- even though he's touched by that theme. Well, everyone is, in a way. 

In AFFC, Arya seems to develop well into some kind of maiden. I'm still reading, but Asha seems to have lost out because of maidenhood. I'd nominate Cersei for the dark side of maidens, but she's already a mother -- I think she's destined for cronedom.

Can I expect ADWD to develop Gendry as a smith? Regular reminders that Gendry is a smith put this idea into my head. Is someone poised to botch smithing? Perhaps Meribald? 

Will TWOW trend croney? A bad end to Cersei? Success for the Queen of Thorns?

Ending on ADOS on the Stranger seems likely. Lots of deaths... The Faith of the Seven seems to acknowledge external elements. Perhaps the age of R'hllor will be ascendant? A final showdown with Qyburn?

I strongly suspect I'm not the first to think of this, but... I'm spoil-shy. Mods, if I botched this, I'm sorry. I have no info. I'm not trying to reveal anything. Please fix if you can.",5,4,False,self,,,,,

So anyway, I think the show will last for 7 seasons. At the end of Season 5, Stannis will take Winterfell and kill Roose and Ramsey Bolton. The rest of Season 6 will have Stannis make his 'quest' for the throne, in Season 6 Episode 9 he will get the throne, and the Season 6 Finale will have Stannis sitting on the throne. In between that time, Dany will finally make her plans to sail for Westeros, and she will set sail in Season 6 Episode 10. That'll be the big Season 6 cliffhanger, her sailing for Westeros. I'm not sure what she can do in Mereen for another season, but I think they are gonna save her voyage for Westeros for Season 6, if she and her pals are still alive by then. Judging by Season 5 so far, she might not be. But Season 6 will end with her sailing for Westeros. Season 7 Episode 9 will probably involve The Night's Watch vs The White Walkers and wrap up the Night's Watch storyline, while Episode 10 will have The Unsullied and Stannis's men fight outside of King's Landing, while Drogon burns the city, and Stannis (prepares for downvotes). The final scene of the whole show will have The Rains of Castamere playing while Dany steps into the Red Keep, not burned up. She looks around it, she sees  Grey Worm (if he's still alive) and Daario Naharis standing next to throne in Kingsguard armor, Missandei is some sort of fancy outfit, Jorah with the Hand of the King badge on his outfit, and Tyrion holding a book, then Daenerys looks at throne, sits on it, end credits. And that's the end of the show.

Naturally people didn't take kindly to this when it was found out. Depsite Bush being not the most popular president by the end of his term it still isn't regarded as proper to give the Vlad the impaler treatment to a US president. Even HBO wasn't pleased and released this statement.

Not sure if anyone has posted this theory yet, so I apologize if it has. 
A couple minutes ago I was thinking about how much D&amp;D are straying from the books at this point in the show. I had my mind on how Tyrion's storyline is being shortened down and how Young Griff hasn't been introduced yet. So that got me thinking, what if he's never introduced at all? 
That brings me to my theory. Since many people think R+L=J, what if the show will just have Jon take the book's storyline for Young Griff some how? 
To me it makes sense, because if R+L=J, then he has the same relation to Dany as Griff. It would be easier to do that than introduce even more character and backstories to the show watchers. 
Anyways, just wanted to share that thought. Let me know if I'm completely off too, cuz I'm not completely through ADWD so I could be speaking out my ass lol",6,0,False,default,,,,,

1. So, are the writers telling us this has been his plan since season one and even before? To back Daenerys?
2. If that's the case, why did he send the order to kill her? There's no way he could have predicted the scene where she was 'saved'. She was very likely dead. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me. 
3. WHY exactly does he believe so strongly in Deanerys? He's been making so many moves for this master plan. Do we know why this is so important for him?

There's been a lot of people after the most recent episode saying D&amp;D are making awful changes, are bad writers, etc. 

Firstly, I'd like to point out, I know this isn't most of the book readers, but we've had the vocal minority really go at it lately, so sorry if it seems I'm lumping you all into one angry group, I'm not.

But those of you who have said that this has ruined the show for you, along with the other changes, and you see every change they've made as bad or whatever; how many of you are actually going to give D&amp;D no chance to explain where they're going with the story? Or refuse to accept that things have to be changed because it's a different medium? 

What I'm really asking is, how many of you are actually going to stop watching the show? Are you just going to stop and refuse to come back, or stop and see what other book readers say when they've seen it, or are you actually over-exaggerating because D&amp;D have taken the story a direction you disagree with but really you're still gonna watch?

My point is, think about it next time before you post about how this has 'killed the show' or 'ruins the whole story'.

Again, I am not putting all book readers in this pigeon-hole, I know there's a lot of book readers who are interested to see where it goes, I know there's a lot who have legitimate concerns and are able to voice them without saying the show is dead, but there's also those who seem to think D&amp;D are just awful, and that all the changes are bad, unapologetically so... yet everyone I know who's said anything like that has simply continued to watch the show... and actually loved later episodes... it just annoys me is all.

/rant

TL;DR if you've said the show 'is dead', or the changes are all awful and D&amp;D are awful, are you actually going to back up what you say and not watch the show? Or like most people who say this stuff, are you actually going to continue to watch and love the show? P.S I know this isn't all book readers, i know most of you are sensible, great people.",3,0,False,default,,,,,

I know that part of the reason I'm finding it not as interesting as previous seasons is the heavy Danny segments as I found those slow in the book as well.

That combined with what I feel were important cuts/deaths of book characters and  what I would consider a poor introduction of the Sand Snakes and cuts to the Marcella storyline really leave me nothing to be excited about. 

Has me feeling I really just want to move on in the series. 

I am alone?

Someone who's deceitful, yes, but only out of necessity and seeks only stability and safety for the oppressed. So far Varys has been someone to root for (if only because he's been working against our favorite characters' enemies).

But I'm wondering if possibly the show is setting Varys up as a dangerous idealogue? Someone so resistant to change they're willing to sellout anyone and everyone (good people or bad) simply for the sake of maintaining the status-quo? In other words, is it possible we'll see Varys actually start to work against Khaleesi? Earning her trust simply for the sake of undermining and controlling her because he sees the writing on the wall and views her as most likely to rule?

I'm not sure what I think about the likelihood of this theory, so thought I'd air it on the subreddit. 

I got the idea mainly from two bits of information:

1. Re-watching the first scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr7wJ_GfPdY) where Tyrion and Varys start to discuss who should be in power. 

2. The discussion on this subreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/34p1mf/tv_question_about_varys/) revolving around the fact that it isn't exactly cut and dry fact that Varys was supporting a Khaleesi rein, at the very least until after Robert's murder.",5,5,False,self,,,,,

I feel like nothing is advancing in their story and at this point really don't care what they have to do with the main story. No sense of character development except for she's gonna train him. Arya's story started out really awesome but feel like they wasted a lot of screen time with her sitting in front of the house of white and black for 10 mind when she could of just said ""I've sat here for a week straight in the rain fuck this shit"" and threw the coin, and watching her sweep the floors/ wash dead dudes and getting no answers wasting even more screen time. Every Gilly scene is a waste of time. Grey worm and Misannde (sp) scenes are wastes of time etc. Second, has any one noticed how many unnecessary scenes are way to long of panned out travel scenes? It seemed like 2 mins of stannis leaving castle black 45 seconds were watching horse hooves in mud, brienne and pod on the cliff watching stannis, misc far away boat shots, etc. I find myself each saying ""OK moving along now, we only have an hour here!""

I'm thinking there is a chance that they are going to combine JonCon and Victarion here into the new and improved Jorah.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

[Jon on a boat to make peace with some wildlings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Bo89m2f6g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=26s)

------------------ 


[Jorah in the fighting pits? Or enslaved... Dunno, I see little mad Dany though](https://youtu.be/F9Bo89m2f6g?t=33s)

------------------ 


[Stannis's war camp in fire as you see him and Davos run like mad, were they ambushed?](https://youtu.be/F9Bo89m2f6g?t=38s)

------------------ 

[Wildlings shooting bows... But at what?](https://youtu.be/F9Bo89m2f6g?t=47s)

[Jon sheathes his sword, Tormond looks distressed... Looks like making peace with the wildlings didn't pan out so good](https://youtu.be/F9Bo89m2f6g?t=51s)

[More Jorah, but more importantly, a small split second of Selyse in the ground looking up in horror!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Bo89m2f6g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1m26s)

So it seems that Stannis and Jon are (possibly) fucked. Jorah killed someone in the pits but hey, he's got greyscale. Any book readers wanna shed some light and tinfoil to go 'round? While I've not read the books I've read lots of wiki and back-stories and /r/asoiaf theories...

Now... R+L=J . We still call it a theory simply because it's not on paper yet. But we all kind of know its 99% true right?

A Song of Ice (jon) and Fire (Dany).

The episode 4 scene with Baelish in the tombs, giving a very odd look when Sansa said Rhaegar raped Lyanna because it's most likely they loved one another.

The tourney of Harrenhal of course.

The fact that Ned Stark would never truly father a bastard son.

There's a whole lot more of course but last night just pushed it over the edge for me.. That scene with Sam and Aemon talking about Dany. I can't quote it exactly but something like ""A lone Targaryen out there."" ""the last targaryen is alone out there"". something like that, then Jon walks in and just stands there..

So at this point, is anyone still questioning it simply because it has ""theory"" hung above it's head or are you with me in accepting that at some point Jon is going to learn he's a Targaryen. Whether it's true Aemon, he leaves the wall and runs into Dany somehow (although I highly doubt that), or he somehow finds out on his deathbed.

When you're replying just be sure to remember I'm only a few chapters before the red wedding so telling me where jon is ADWD or AFFC would be painful for me.

He goes on about how everyone told him to give his daughter up, that she was going to die and there was nothing he could do about it.  He never shows emotion, but in this scene we were able to see how much he does care and feels when he explained why he didn't give up on her.

Episode 5 has a similar situation with Roose Bolton, where he explains Ramsay's birth.  In a polar opposite situation, Roose explains how his son was birthed of a random woman that was married without his consent so he raped her.  She appeared with Ramsay the next year and he was going to drown him, but didn't because Ramsay was his son, and he felt that connection.

We see how love stayed an execution (an arguably mercifully killing of Shirena) despite everyone telling him to forget about her.  And then we see a petty and despicable act of murder avoided also out of a type of love.  The same outcomes for similar reasons, just masterfully woven together by the directors to show even more character depth for these characters.  I love it!",4,41,False,self,,,,,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_the_mountain
I don't know how common this theory is (as I have made my rendition up without outside input), but I posited it the first time some 4 years ago on the ice and fire forums. I feel it is time to bring it up again, to see if anybody else have had similar thoughts in the meantime, as I was standing pretty well alone with my 'hodor theory' back then.
The sleeping hero motif describes a scenario in which a hero of a time long since past sits beneath a mountain (or castle, depending on circumstance), and waits for a time where the nation is in great peril.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_the_mountain#/media/File:Holger_danske.jpg
This is Ogier the Dane, a specific statue sitting beneath Kronborg Castle, and I believe this is the motive of the stark statues beneath winter fell. It should be noted that the bones of the starks all rest with their statues. It is supposedly a tradition that carries on back through time, all the way back to bran the builder.
I believe that when the wall falls, the sleepers will awaken; the starks will all rise as 'stone men', and attempt to lead the world of westerns against the white walkers. Princess Shireen's knowing of the stark statues strikes me as just the latest indication that this is going to come about.

1] I'm a little confused with Stannis's story of how Shireen got grey scale. Did the merchant give her grey scale on purpose?

2] Does Theon know that Bran and Rickon are still alive or as far as he knows they're both dead? I can't remember if he found out or not...

3] Completely unrelated but someone had a post yesterday about Valerian steel and how Ned's sword was melted down to make two swords for Jamie and Joffrey. What happened to Joffrey's sword? Was that buried with him or did Tommen/someone else inherit it?

*""Theon Greyjoy is revealed to be a prisoner in the Dreadfort's dungeon, mutilated and driven insane by torture, and Ramsay Bolton forces him to take on the identity of his servant ""Reek"". Ramsay's father Roose Bolton leads his army to Moat Cailin, along with several thousand Frey allies; Ramsay secures their passage by sending Reek, again assuming the identity of Theon Greyjoy, to negotiate the surrender of the Ironborn garrison abandoned by Victarion. Reek succeeds, but Ramsay flays the Ironborn regardless. When Roose arrives with Ramsay's bride 'Arya Stark', Reek recognizes her as Sansa's friend Jeyne Poole. The wedding is held at Winterfell, and to convince the North that Jeyne is Arya, Reek assumes the role of Theon again to represent the lord of Winterfell and give away the bride. After the wedding, Ramsay repeatedly abuses Jeyne physically and sexually.""*
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons

My question is this; Has the show gone too far from the path of the book here? The 'bride' to Ramsey is not even a real stark in the books. Do you think HBO is jumping ahead of the books and leading us to the same conclusion while using a different path? 

Also what else is differing from the books this season? I feel that this season has definitely taken a side step from the books story. To name a few, Jamie Lannister going to Dorne, and Sansa and Little finger's current situation..",2,0,False,self,,,,,

This command bothered me, and I've had some time to think about why. Essentially, that realization came when I asked myself what would have happened had Daenerys given a command like that in the books (I know, I know). A Song of Ice and Fire doesn't really have a central 'moral' or 'message', but if it did, at least one candidate would be 'decisions have consequences, especially those made by people in power'. And yet Daenerys gives the order, and then it's done. No fuss, no repercussions. Had Dany tried something like this in the books... ok, maybe she could have fairly quickly scooped up a few of the less careful ones, had she taken advantage of the element of surprise, but after that... taking the rest would have meant storming the pyramids. The Great Masters would not have gone quietly. It would have been war in the streets. And when the Unsullied stepped over the mangled bodies of friend and foe alike, it would have been to find their quarries fled into hiding, or having killed themselves to avoid capture. Some would be taken, sure. And at the end of the day, Daenerys would have a few nobles in her custody, and more blood on her hands than the Sons of the Harpy had ever had... so far, at least. Because the Sons of the Harpy? Would have been *pissed*. Dany might have thought things had been bad before, but nothing could have prepared her for the shitstorm that would be unleashed by this simple command. It's easy to talk about 'angry snakes', until you find yourself ruling over a city slithering with them. Meereen would have been thrown into chaos overnight. Not even a marriage to Hizdahr could have calmed the waters after that.

Every time they go to Mareen and I have to look at her emotionless face saying things that just make her look weaker and weaker, I want to throw my remote at the TV. She's ruling(if you can even call it that) one city that is so far away from anything Westeros, that it makes it seem like we're wasting a quarter of the season only to see NOTHING will happen... again. 


-Are they doing this on purpose? Am I supposed to not like her now, so that when she does something great I feel foolish? 

-How many people would be pissed if they killed her off? At this point, I'd cheer for it, personally. 

-Who would you rather see get her screen time? Maybe Bran right? He's a warg! Let's see some more warging! Why are we supposed to be dazzled by a dragon that just flies over peoples heads, when we can see a kid that can literally control other animals/people do some damage?

I really hope things pick up with her being involved in what's happening in Westeros soon. Hopefully Tyrion coming will help such things.

**Note on Spoiler Scope**

Before we begin let's discuss what non-readers should expect of spoilers from this post... as always I am tagging it to cover the most recent episode as well as the books up to where we are in the show.  The second part of the post (dealing with the Doom of Valyria) will entail almost entirely of LORE, and will be completely non-reader safe.. However the first section on Greyscale, specifically dealing with the stone-men attack, I will cover a few book-to-show differences, most notably the different location of where it happens..Book readers know that this scene also takes place with ""different traveling companions"" than in the show.. I **WILL NOT** discuss those differences, as they are huge spoilers, and wish to keep this post safe for non-readers.. feel free to discuss those differences in the comments, but please hide those behind appropriate tags if you do so.  With the spoiler scope out of the way, let's get to the post...


------------------

**Greyscale and Stone-Men**


- Greyscale: The disease, transmission and treatment

First of all, what is greyscale?  As both the books and the show have demonstrated, it is a highly contagious, and often fatal disease that effects the afflicted's skin, turning it stiff, cracked, and by all accounts dead with the dark grey appearance of stone giving it it's name...  If caught the disease starts small, but if left unattended/untreated can spread through the diseased's entire body and eventually to the brain, corrupting the sanity of the individual.   The transmission of the disease seems to be only made by physical contact with the dead skin of someone, or something else that has the disease, as we see with Jorah Mormont, or the story of Shireen contracting it through a doll that had the disease upon it.. however there are some hints in the books that the disease can also be transmitted through airborne means...Greyscale thrives among cool and damp climates, of which Dragonstone (where Shireen contracted her bout) certainly applies. In the most damp regions like the ruins of Valyria, or the Sorrows (which we will get into in a bit) in which the air is cool and thick, it is no surprise that the illness thrives there, and why it can possibly be transmitted among the thick fogs and mists of those regions... 

So, you think you are afflicted with greyscale, what do you do?  First of all test yourself, one of the side benefits of Greyscale is that it is a relatively painless disease, and areas where greyscale is visible feel no pain, prod your fingers and toes with a knife or a needle to where you would draw blood, if you feel the pain from doing this you are in the clear, if you don't feel it then you are in trouble.. Tyrion has this done to him in the aftermath of the Stone Men attack assuring the reader that Tyrion does not contract the disease.. but if you are not as lucky as Tyrion what is next for you?  While the disease is highly contagious, and very hard to get rid of, it is not impossible.  First of all, if you are a child you are in luck, like chicken-pox greyscale is somewhat less severe in the young, in fact most children who get the disease tend to survive it, with treatment.  As princess Shireen can attest to the scars of the disease remain, but the sickness itself is gone and those who survive are said to be immune from catching the disease again or the much more fatal cousin of the disease, the grey plague. (more on this in a bit) ,   As for adults however, you are pretty much screwed.  Greyscale can still be treated, remedies such as limes, vinegar, scaling baths have been shown to help stay the disease, and perhaps cure it in the young, but nothing has been proven completely effective.. One other solution (and the most viable solution for an adult) is quick amputation of an infected limb, but even then by the time greyscale becomes visibly apparent it is often too late for amputation to work reliably, those who have cut off a hand to prevent the illness from spreading have in a few days time woke up to find the disease festering on another.  Greyscale is a terrible disease, though there is one disease that is somewhat worse, and that is the grey-plague.

- Grey Plague

The Grey Plague, is the quicker, very much more fatal cousin of Greyscale.  While in the books it is stated as a relative of greyscale it is not exactly stated what the symptoms are, and how it is transmitted, other than it kills those who it infects fast, much more so than greyscale.. In the history of Westeros there was one notable outbreak of the Grey Plague, and that happened in Old Town a several decades ago when Grand Maester Pycell was training at the Citadel.  By the end of the outbreak half the city, and three quarters of the Citadel had died. But due to the efforts of the then Lord Hightower, by closing the ports of the city and preventing anyone from coming or going, the outbreak never left town, and a potential pandemic was averted.. Lord Hightower was murdered for these efforts when the city was finally reopened, but he avoided catastrophe nonetheless.  Not much else is said about the grey-plague other than it being related to greyscale, and that those who have caught and survived greyscale are immune to this disease as I mentioned above...  But there is one final form of greyscale, one worse than the quick death of the grey plague, and that is what happens when those afflicted with greyscale are left untreated, or where treatment has failed, and the disease allowed to corrupt the minds of those who have it, and that being what we witnessed in last night's episode.... The Stone Men.

- The Stone Men, and the attack in the Sorrows

As we have seen in the show, and in the books, and as I have touched upon a few times in this post, the final and worst from of Greyscale would be what happens when you become what is colloquially known as a ""Stone Man"".  This occurs when the greyscale has completely taken over the bodies of the victims, causing their entire appearance to be grey, hard, and cracked, giving them their name of ""Stone Men"".  In this final form, the greyscale is so rampant that the victims' mind is also attainted, causing erratic and violent behavior to anyone they encounter. (Though they are normally docile around other stone men).  It is also in this final form that they are their most contagious, merely touching a stone man or being touched by a stone man is an almost assured case of greyscale for the person who made contact with the grey flesh of his mindless attacker. It is not known, or at least outright stated in the books, how long Stone Men can live in this last state before they finally succumb to the disease and pass away.  The show suggests at most a few weeks, but the books are a bit more vague, and even hint that the Stone Men have at least somewhat of an idea of their surroundings and are able to keep themselves alive, and even somewhat of a societal structure in the places that they gather, places like the sorrows on the route of the massive River Rhoyne.    

To close off this first section of this week's post I wish to discuss some book to show differences with the Stone Men attack on Tyrion that occurred, primarily the difference of local that it happened.  First of all, Jorah was not involved in the attack, the attack happened prior to Tyrion arriving at Volantis and being taken captive by Mormont. Tyrion was accompanied by a group of people (which as I said earlier I will not delve into here, but if you are a non-reader, **do not** look into who these people were, you **WILL** be spoiled if you do) sailing down the Rhoyne en route to Volantis when the attack happened.  The attack happened in a location known as ""The Sorrows"" just outside a ruined city known as ""Chroyane"".  Over a thousand years ago the Valyrain empire was engaged in a series of wars, known as ""The Spice Wars"", with the Rhoynar of the river, during the second of these wars the Valyrians captured a Rynoar prince known as Garin the Great, and hung him in a cage above the river.. Garin prayed that their god (""The Mother Rhoyne) would vanquish the Valyrians and drive them from their homeland, supposedly the river then rose drowning the Valyrian invaders and drove the remaining out of the city..  However the city was flooded and destroyed, and it remains so at the time of the main story.  This city in shambles is heavy with fog making it hard for sailers of the Rhoyne to see and navigate.. There has not been a ruler of this area since the time of the Rhoynar, and the land is lawless, making it a popular haunt for pirates and outlaws, as well as a convenient place to send those afflicted with greyscale from neighboring areas.... And thus this area is also infested with Stone Men.   While sailing away from the banks of this river keeps you away from the dangers of the ruined city, you must sail beneath a landmark known as ""The Bridge of Dream"" to continue on down the Rhoyne, it is this landmark that several dozen Stone Men make their home, and from where they attacked Tyrion and his companions in the book, leading to the same conclusion as we saw in the show, with Tyrion nearly being drowned, and nearly infected by one of the Stone Men.  The change of local and companions in the show works great for the scene, as it allows the scene to take place with characters we already know and lets us learn a bit about the history of one of the greatest peoples in the Lore of the series, as well as see something that even book readers have had not had a chance to experience yet... the ruins of old Valyria... which allows me to transition to the next section of this post... 

-----------

**The Doom of Old Valyria**

- The largest power in the World, Valyria just before the Doom

In previous posts I have talked a bit about the Doom, as well as the old Valyrian freehold in the context of other posts.  But for this post we can focus in on the Valyrians themselves, but particularly for this first section let's talk about where the Valyrian freehold stood just before their demise.. It can honestly be said that the Valyrian Freehold was at the height of it's power when it all came down.. They were an unopposed force in Essos, and had been so for over a thousand years. Their enemies of Old Ghiscar had been vanquished and subjugated for a couple of millennia, and their foes of the Rhoynar had fled Essos altogether for Westeros several hundred years prior to the Doom after a series of wars with the Valyrians.  They had 8 of the 9 (soon to be) Free Cities under their control, and absolute authority over trade (of which the slave trade was included) in Essos.. And they held this all with aid of the several Dragon Riding families that controlled and governed the Freehold, and at the time just prior to the Doom their reach was continuing to expand, even as far as a small island just off the coast of Westeros, Dragonstone, an outpost for the Valyrian Freehold, were they looking even farther?  Would an eventual invasion of Westeros by the Valyrians have happened?  The World never knew the answer to that question, because right when they were on top of it all, the Doom came.....

My life got flipped-turned upside down 
And I'd like to take a minute 
Just sit right there 
I'll tell you how I became the prince of the Targaryen heir

In Essos, Meereen born and raised 
At Slavers Bay was where I spent most of my days 
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool 
And tradin' some slaves outside the Dothraki pool 
When the Targaryen Queen who was up to no good 
Started making trouble in my neighborhood 
She freed Yunkai slaves and my dad got scared 
He said 'Let's crucify our slaves and give her a scare'

I begged and pleaded with him day after day 
But he picked 163 kids and sent them on their way 
Daenerys sent us slave collars and she called us bigots. 
The Great Masters said ""Chill, our champion will win it.""

First class, yo this is bad 
Watching Daario beat our champions ass. 
Is this what the Slaves Masters of Yunkai feel like? 
Hmmmmm this ain't alright.

But wait Dany crucifies the Grand Masters, my dad, all that
 Is this the results of our slavery acts? 
I can't believe it. I'll visit her throne room 
I hope they're prepared for the heir of Loraq

Well, the discussion is done and when I came out 
I'm allowed to bury my dad so I get the hell out 
I ain't trying to get arrested yet 
I'm gonna wait I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappear.

I whistled for a slave but there were none left 
Because Dany's law forbids it... or so it appears 
If anything the Sons of the Harpy disagree 
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Let's get the fighting pits open this year'

Barristan Selmy died at about 7 or 8 
And Daenerys said 'Yo burn his ass' 
I closed my eyes 
I was really scared 
But she said 'Nevermind, make him the prince of my bed'",1,10,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, I just wanted to try to put out this thought that has been bothering me since we learned of the Sansa/Ramsay marriage.

In the show, it appears to be common knowledge that Roose betrayed the Starks and personally killed Robb. Jon Snow knows, the lords in the North know and refuse to acknowledge the Bolton's rule...we can assume that Roose would assume that Sansa knows, right? Especially if Littlefinger is with her.

So, even without knowing that she knows, shouldn't Roose play things safe and keep an eye on her? He didn't trust Littlefinger's motives when they arrived, especially after the letter from Cersei came. Sansa may be just a girl, but Roose is smart. Shouldn't he be asking Sansa questions about why she wants to marry Ramsay, when they are responsible for her mother and brother dying?

Now, on the other hand, we can assume that Roose thinks Sansa doesn't know. This seems unlikely, since it's established that so many other people know what he did. But let's go with it - if Roose thinks Sansa is perfectly harmless, why is Sansa openly unhappy and almost hostile in the dinner scene in last night's episode? She greeted Roose with a smile and curtsy - isn't her act of a typical lady of the court all she has in the books so far? It's how she survived King's Landing. If they aren't going to bring up what happened to her family, wouldn't Sansa be better off acting cooperative and gracious to her hosts?

Overall, I just feel like we need to know what these two characters are thinking. Roose, IMO, should be keeping people watching Sansa when she goes down to the crypts and Littlefinger follows her. And Sansa hasn't shown any indication that she wants revenge for what happened to her family, so why ever show any negative feelings at all? Why risk upsetting them?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

#Episode Preview Spoilers

* **Any discussion marked [S5][E4] does not cover spoilers in the S5E5 preview.** -- Last week, the ending of S5E4 was left pretty open ended, with what seemed to be a confirmation on the ending in the preview for S5E5.
* **Things that occur in Episode Previews are spoilers for that NEXT episode.** -- Discussing anything shown in the E5 previews is a S5E5 spoiler, so it can only be posted in threads marked [S5][E5], [S5], [TV], [All Show], or [All Spoilers]. 

Specifically, [S5E5](#s ""The Preview implied that Barristan Selmy was dead. This information is not apparent from S5E4 and is thus a spoiler for the next episode."") [S5E4](#s ""Saying that Grey Worm and Barristan Selmy are left in a dire position at the end of the episode is not a spoiler in a thread tagged S5E4, and can be posted without spoiler tags."")

One is acceptable, the other is not. If you're posting based on information from an episode preview, then it must be tagged for that episode.


---
#Theories are Spoilers Too

* **Please remember that theory and speculation are NOT covered by book/tv spoiler tags.** -- If a tread does not include a [Theory] title tag, you must use a green spoiler tag for theory information in your comments. 
* **Major theories especially need warning.** -- Just because a theory is ""well known"" it does not mean it doesn't need a spoiler warning. The big theories  need the spoiler warnings MORE, not less.  The specific issue this week is [Jon Snow origin speculation](#g ""Anything that names his mother or deviates from Ned being Jon's father needs a warning."")
* **A+B=C formulas dealing with the true secret heritage of any character are spoilers too.** -- They're often very easy to figure out in the context of any thread.  Don't label your theory details with a formula spoiler.


---
#[Show Only] Title Tags

* **A lot of people are confusing the [Show Only] with the [All Show] tag.** -- [All Show] is a Main scope.  Main scopes state what content is ok in the post.  [Show Only] is an Extension scope.  Extension scopes are optional and provide extra info/clarification about what is ok to post in a thread.
* **[All Show] means that any information from the show can be posted.** -- Information from any book that does not appear in the show the exact same way must be under a red books spoiler tag.
* **[Show Only] means the discussion is only for non-readers.** -- Book readers are NOT ALLOWED to post in [Show Only] threads.  

The history behind the [Show Only] post is that we used it for annual ""What are your predictions for the upcoming season?"" threads and occasional speculation posts. The point of those posts were to get information from non-readers without readers posting what they already knew from the books, we implemented very strict rules.  It didn't matter if the reader comments were not spoiling anything; too many readers made comments that were simply snide or condescending, laughing at the non-readers for their ""cute"" ideas.  This is a no drama sub, and that rudeness is not ok here.

The show's timeline has now caught up with the books, so there is less reason to have the [Show Only] tag.  We are currently discussing the future of the [Show Only] tag, and you may see a poll at the end of the season asking if we should keep it.  But until there is a change to the [Show Only] extension tag, **show watchers** should try to refrain from using [Show Only] threads to discuss the show unless there's a specific reason to exclude book readers. **Book readers** must refrain from posting in any [Show Only] threads regardless.

---
#EDIT: One More Thing

**Something else that keeps popping up: [S5/AGOT].**  Sometimes it seems the OP thinks that means [S5] and [TV], and other times it appears to mean [S5] and [Books].  What it really means is [S5] and [Book 1], which in almost every case that it's been used makes no sense.  If you're unsure how to tag for the books, look at the examples in [the spoiler guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide).

This interesting detail concerns Stannis's feelings toward Renly.

Here is the scene in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIr-tULqK5I [1]


The scene occurs after Renly's assassination, and Davos confronts Stannis about Melisandre birthing the shadow baby in order to gain advantage in the war.
At first, Stannis is blunt while discussing his brother's death and says:

&gt; ""Fools love a fool. I grieve for [Renly] as well. For the boy he was - not the man he grew to be.""

There's not a lot of love felt in these words nor in the indifference of his tone when he says it.

Stannis remains prickly when Davos tries to express his concerns over using Melisandre's tactics to win the war. He repeatedly commands Davos to drop the subject and questions Davos's loyalty. Davos responds:

&gt; ""Loyal service means telling hard truths.""

Davos's counsel convinces Stannis to sail for the Blackwater without Melisandre, and Stannis tells Davos he will lead the fleet. Davos claims that Renly's lords won't be happy that someone with less experience was chosen before them. To which Stannis responds:

&gt; ""Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. **Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.**""

After Stannis says this and Davos leaves him (around the 2:30 mark of the video), the camera focuses back in on Stannis and he proceeds to frown and give a deep sigh. I won't lie that when I watched this scene, I felt Dillane's acting rattle me deep in my core. Hats off to his performance. Why did this sigh affect me so much? Because of what it says about how Stannis really feels about his actions.

Let's analyze the significance of the line **""hard truths cut both ways.""** Well on one level, it refers to how Renly's lords will have to accept that they are under Stannis's command now. He will spare them, but they must follow his lead. But what else does this line say? Let's think back to the scene where Renly and Stannis have their brief confrontation in one last ditch effort to make the other stand down. Unsurprisingly, they get nowhere. At the end of the scene however, before riding back to his camp, Renly says:

&gt; ""Hard to believe... I loved him once.""

Much how Renly acknowledges the fact that there was once love between him and his brother, I believe that the sigh Stannis gives after Davos leaves his tent is Stannis's grief and guilt that he feels for murdering Renly. Stannis did what he did because he saw it as the only way he could fulfill his duty to the realm, and now he will have to live with that action for the rest of his life.

From what I understand the Unsullied fight in phalanx formation, depending on their shields and spears to win the day, however:

1. With those lose of their testicles, wouldn't the Usullied lose considerable muscle-mass? Given the nature of phalanx warfare (i.e. a shoving contest, backed with spears and shields) wouldn't this hamper their effectiveness?

2. Why don't the Unsullied use swords? Given the scope of their recent conflict, would not wielding a sword, at least as a back-up weapon, enhance their arsenal and allow for close-in-defence? Does the lore give any hints as to why the Unsullied don't use swords?

3. I know the lore points to the use of castration for ensuring discipline, but - could not the same thing be achieved by proper training? Granted of course, proper training is limited to standing armies, but would not a legion of indoctrinated, non-castrated Unsullied be more effective?

Hell, Wolves of the Calla is a retelling of ""Seven Samurai"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"" right down to the epic quote, ""We deal in lead.""

I'm pretty sure GRRM read SK because of the definition and the naming of the character Gilly. A gilly in the gunslinger's world is a second-wife, taken to increase the fertility of the husband and ensure heirs, especially if the primary wife is barren. In Sam's case, an ironic twist.

I think that was the most powerful part of the episode last night, at least for a Theon fan. Yes, yes, it's funny because Sansa shouldn't be in Winterfell at all, according to the books, but let's put that aside for a moment and be serious. 
The raw emotion with which that simple line was delivered was really powerful. I think it was our first signs of the ""old Theon"" (he's always been Theon, but he's been through a lot) coming back. (Props as always to Alfie Allen for his ridiculously incredible acting)
Most people shrug off the encounter between Sansa and Theon yesterday because it was pretty short, but actually it was charged with meaning and emotion. Sansa finds Theon and the first thing she says is his name. ""Theon."" This is incredibly powerful because so much of what has been done to Theon has been stripping him of his identity. In one moment, everything that Theon has been forced to put aside is pulled back...old memories of the Starks (and therefore a great deal of his pre-Bolton life), his identity.
In that moment, Theon is flooded with things that he has been brainwashed to forget. But his reaction, is rather touching because in such an intense personal moment, he is really selfless. ""You shouldn't be here"" sort of means several different things. Theon is concerned for Sansa's safety. She shouldn't be in Winterfell. She shouldn't be with him. Both things jeopardize her safety. Theon's instant reaction is to try to protect Sansa in the only way he can--to tell her she isn't safe. In this way, he transcends everything...his tortured self, his actual self, and in this very short interaction demonstrates a level of selflessness that is rather commendable for someone in his situation. Theon's entire survival technique has been to prioritize his safety in every possible way he can (this is true in the books, but especially true if you consider the Yara rescue attempt which I loathe but is show canon so we might as well use it), but he cares so much for Sansa that he is willing to endanger himself to try to help her in his own very limited way. I think it's rather a beautiful scene when you look at it that way. ",74,215,False,self,,,,,

In the TV series, the dates of events and characters ages have been altered and extended (to fit the aging actors or to pass unethical issues) to the point where the events of season 1 to season 5 happened in within at least 4 years. For example, Sansa is 13 in season 1, but now is 17 in the beginning of season 5. The problem I see is that Gilly's baby has been on the show since season 3. It's been at least 1 year (most likely 2 years) between the events of season 3 and 5, and whilst every other character has aged, Gilly's baby hasn't.

Viewers are enticed by creators George R.R. Martin, David Benioff, and D.B. Weiss depiction of a fantasy world filled with violence, sex, and power struggles. The series is about the struggle for rule over the seven kingdoms. Viewers watch as multiple men and women plot, fight, and kill to sit on the Iron Throne. In addition, the show has called to attention the significance of gender roles. Game of Thrones takes place in a time when women were assumed to fill a very traditional role. They were not expected to rule and were often seen as less than men. However throughout the series many strong women emerge. The women of Game of Thrones range anywhere across the spectrum of femininity from a traditional gender role as a wife and mother to a warrior who is feared even by men. However, one woman in particular has emerged as a fan favorite and the choice of many fans to rule the seven kingdoms. Daenerys Targaryen is a fair and beautiful young woman who, throughout the series, goes through the transformation of a helpless captive, to a loving wife and mother, and finally to a ruthless warrior queen. Daenerys is able to encompass the entire spectrum of the roles of women, which has lead to her immense popularity. The creators of Game of Thrones use the vehicle of a familiar captivity narrative to allow Daenerys to go beyond the limitations of the female gender role that often limit modern day heroines.
	

Perhaps the most famous story of a mother turned warrior is the captivity narrative of Hannah Duston. Captivity Narratives were among the most popular genres of literature through the 19th century and offered a stage that portrayed a woman as both a victim and a hero creating a sympathetic but also strong character. In the late 17th century Hannahs town was raided by Native Americans and Hannah, along with her infant child, were taken captive. The Indians then proceeded to brutally murder the child in front of her. Motivated by the death of her child and a desire for revenge, Hannah and the other captives killed the Indians while they slept and Hannah returned home with the Indians scalps as prizes. Hannahs story gained immense popularity in the 19th century because it showed the strength that lies in motherhood. Hannah Duston did not write her own narrative but her story was far from untold. Her story can be found in at least 9 different publications. Many writers of the story celebrated Hannah for her heroics (Weis). 
	

In the beginning of the 18th century, Cotton Mather, a Puritan Minister and one of the first to tell Hannahs story, glorified Hannah in his sermons. She was to be admired for her strength as a mother for taking revenge for her dead child. Mathers account glorified feminine strength and assertiveness. He believed that Hannah was justified in killing those who murdered her child. He preached, She thought she was not forbidden by any law to take away the life of the murderers, by whom her child had been butchered (Sayre). Mather was the only author to have spoken with Hannah about the account but the tales of her heroics inspired many other authors to recount the story. By the 19th century, the traditional view of the domestic mother had begun to change. Women began to assume roles outside of the home and many had jobs to help support their family. Women were involved in benevolent reform associations, antislavery movements, and anti prostitution campaigns. Hannahs story became more and more popular as she began to represent the idea of female individualism that was spreading throughout the nation (Weis). 
	

Before Hannahs story, women were almost strictly depicted as fitting their gender roles. Although there were women who were seen as strong and independent, they did not kill and they relied on men to save them. Captivity narratives, in general, were a genre that showed the strength of women and these narratives were extremely popular because this. Mary Rowlandsons captivity narrative is perhaps the most famous of the early captivity narratives. Like Duston, Native Americans took her captive. Faced with this horrible situation, she was able to overcome it by embracing the strength of traditional femininity. When she was captured she did what a good puritan women was supposed to do and she looked to God for strength. She did not try to escape, but rather trusted that everything that was happening was a part of Gods plan. She was able to find her place amongst the Indians by embracing her role as a white women and utilizing her feminine skills. Mary sewed clothing for the Indians in return for food to make her captivity more bearable. Marys strength was seen in her ability to endure, adapt, and survive. Mary was the perfect traditional female role model.	
	

Hannah Dustons narrative became so popular because she went beyond the traditional female gender role. Hannah was placed in the worst scenario imaginable; she was taken captive and forced to witness the brutal murder of her child. However, she did not play the role of the damsel in distress that many other captive women assumed. Instead, she took matters into her own hands. She was the mother who stood up for her murdered child and avenged her childs death. The reason her viscous killing, and the breaking away from limitations of the traditional gender mold, was so accepted was because of the motivation behind it. Hannahs killing was seen as still within a womans gender role. She was a mother committing this act for her child.
	

John Greenleaf Whittiers depiction of Dustons narrative tells of how there are circumstances when it is appropriate for women to commit acts that go beyond their expected roles. Whittier begins The Mothers Revenge with a description of the traditional woman. He describes women as more mild and pure than men and defines their traditional roles in the home. However, he goes on to say that there have been astonishing manifestations of female fortitude and power in the ruder and sterner trials of humanity. Hannah is not a monstrous woman who would have under any other circumstances killed her ten Native American captors. After witnessing the murder of her infant child and the Indians mocking her and her baby, An instantaneous change had been wrought in her very nature; the angel had become a demon. Hannah would no longer wait for a man to come and save her and she would no longer turn to her womanly skills to survive her captivity. Hannah killed her captors for her murdered child. Whittier reinforces the motivation behind her revenge when she hesitates before she is about to kill the last Indian. She thinks to herself, It is a poor boy a poor child, and perhaps he has a mother! She then thinks of her own children and she lets the boy live. The fascination behind Hannah Duston lies in societys conception of gender roles. Women are not supposed to be killers. Women are supposed to act like Mary Rowlandson and find strength within the feminine mold. However, motherhood is as feminine as it gets. So when Hannah killed her captors she committed an act that was far from traditional femininity while still maintaining her gender role because she killed as a mother for her dead child. 
	

Game of Thrones has become the popular show that it is today because of the complexity and dynamic aspects of its characters. Daenerys Targaryen, perhaps the most popular character in the show undergoes a transformation that allows her to become a celebrated feminine protagonist. Daenerys has a number of things going for her that make her so popular in the show but ultimately the creators of the series drew upon the elements of captivity narratives, and in particular Dustins narrative, to make her a fan favorite. Daenerys story is essentially a long captivity narrative. She is first introduced as a captive of her older brother who sells her to a powerful warlord named Khal Drogo in return for his army. Immediately viewers sympathize with her as she is forced to suffer the fate worth than death. She is forced to marry the warlord and to provide him with a son. However, from here viewers see the strength of Daenerys as she turns the sex from a rape where she is dominated by Khal Drogo into a consensual relationship. Their marriage becomes one of mutual respect and admiration. Eventually Daenerys becomes pregnant but a witch murders her unborn child and husband and viewers see the ruthlessness of a mother motivated by revenge. 
	

This is when her story begins to take on Duston-like qualities. Daenerys burns the witch alive and three baby dragons emerge from the fire. From this point she becomes known as the Mother of Dragons. After this, Daenerys is no longer just a wife and mother fulfilling traditional gender roles but also a warrior queen who takes upon the duty to free the slave cities of the world. She travels the region and frees the slaved cities by killing the masters. She has her dragons burn the slavers alive in one city and in another she has the masters crucified. However, these gruesome acts of revenge are celebrated rather than condemned both in the show and by viewers. She is given the nickname Mhysa, which means mother. Like Duston, Daenerys brutal quest for revenge is admired by viewers and seen as justified. Daenerys character is only possible because of what has happened in her past. A caring motherly woman who had not had a child taken from her would not be capable of committing the brutal acts that Daenerys undertakes. And a women who does possess the qualities to brutally murder her enemies and lead an army would not be able to do so and still possess the kind and nurturing qualities that generate the love and affection that Daenerys' followers feel towards her.  
	

In modern literature and film gender roles are not as confiding as they were in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the perception of what a women should be still exists in society today. Two modern fictional heroines in film and literature that are held back by gender expectations are Hermione Granger from Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen from the Hunger Games. Hermione is the more constrained hero. In the Harry Potter series Hermione, Harry, and Ron fight to save the world from an evil murdering wizard. Hermione is a very popular character that many girls idolized. She was smart, beautiful, and extremely talented. In fact, author Rochelle Keyhan in her article Daenerys Targaryen: Feminism for the Iron Throne states, After my decade long experience with Harry Potter ended with the 2011 release of Deathly Hallows Part 2, Ive been left wanting for a new Hermione, a similarly amazing and feminist mainstream character (Keyhan). However, as popular as Hermione was, she was never able to step out of the constraints placed on her as a female. Even though throughout the whole series Hermione is a more talented wizard than Harry, she never actually does any of the fighting. Her contributions to saving the wizarding world are limited to what she can do as a non-violent female heroine. Rather, her contributions arise from her quick wit and cleverness as well as her compassion and loving nature. She becomes romantically involved with Ron and acts as a loving and caring mother like figure for Harry. Throughout the series she remains the perfect pure soul that society expects of femininity. Hermione could never be the leader. She has to rely on Harry and others to do the dirty work and accomplish what she is unable to because of her feminine limitations. Daenerys, like Hermione, possesses the traditional feminine qualities associated with a female heroine. Although her child was taken from her before she could ever meet it, she is a mother at heart. She is known as the Mother of Dragons and while dragons are terrifying and destructive creatures, she is able to calm them. She is shown sitting with them and petting them as if they were her puppies. Daenerys frees cities of slaves who join them and give her the nickname Mhysa. She cares for those who follow her and refers to them as her children. Daenerys embraces the traditional feminine gender role of motherhood.
	

Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of the Hunger Games, is a step closer to escaping the limitations of traditional female expectations. Katniss is from a dystopian society where teenagers are forced to enter a contest called the Hunger Games and to fight to the death. Katniss is a heroine that is beloved by the feminist community because of her strength and courage. She is a mold breaking, ass-kicking heroine who is rarely seen in Hollywood blockbusters. Unlike Hermione, Katniss does her own dirty work and she kills her enemies. However, Katniss is still unable to escape the limitations of the female gender role. In order to create a heroine that could kill and out of the common female protagonist role, the creators of the Hunger Games created a heroine who has abandoned the female gender role altogether. The Hunger Games exhibits a gender role reversal. Katniss is not a loving and empathetic girl; rather, she is emotionally distant. The feminist community loves Katniss because she broke the traditional heroine mold. However, she could never be the caring mother like figure because she lacks the traditional feminine qualities. Although Daenerys lacks the exterior physical toughness of Katniss, she still has the strength and mindset necessary to kill to for the ones she loves. She has killed her enemies on numerous occasions and like Katniss is not afraid to confront them face-to-face. This is shown when she goes into the House of the Undying to rescue her then young dragon. Amidst dark magic Daenerys and her dragon are able to burn the building to the ground and with it the evil warlocks. 
	

Daenerys has emerged as the fan favorite in Game of Thrones because she is able to transcend the limitations of the traditional heroine. Her character does not have to be grouped into a mold of either the caring and loving mother like figure or the renegade badass tomboy. Through the medium of a captivity narrative, the creators of Game of Thrones developed a mother like figure who has the strength, will, and brutality required to enact revenge upon and destroy her enemies. Because Daenerys is able to encapsulate the nurturing qualities of the traditional female gender role but is not limited to its restrictions she has emerged as a fan favorite and perhaps the most suited to succeed in her quest to rule the seven kingdoms.

For those who don't know, this season compresses Book 4 and Book 5 of the series into 10 hours, so a lot of storylines have been merged, altered, or cut altogether. This is partly out of necessity since the two books take place at the same time and are split based on POVs, so a straight adaptation would mean half the characters would be left our for an entire year, which would be unrealistic given actors' contracts and schedules. But some book-readers think the showrunners are changing too much and have voiced their opinions quite vocally (like the current top post on the subreddit). 

So I'm curious about the opinions of people who've only seen the show. Does this season still feel similar to the previous seasons or do you feel that something is different?

This originally started as an argument with a friend as to whether Emilia Clarke is a good actor or not, but I decided to greatly expand it in order to learn some other things about fans of the show. Do the websites you post on influence your character likes and dislikes? What about whether you've read the books? Do book readers tend to think the acting is worse or better than their show-only counterparts?

I dunno about you guys, but I'm interested in finding out.

I'll be posting this on /tv/, WotW, /r/asoiaf, /r/samplesize, and Westeros.org and comparing the answers within the next few days. If it goes over well, I might do something a little more comprehensive towards the end of the season.

**Update:** Over 500 responses from /r/gameofthrones so far! Thanks a ton. It's going to take a bit longer to gather a significant number of responses for places like Watchers on the Wall, but I'm confident the results will be posted within 7 days, and hopefully by the end of this weekend.

**Update 2:** There's been some confusion regarding what it means to ""like"" a character. This is my fault for being an amateur at conducting surveys and not making it more clear. To be explicit: if you find a character entertaining and like to watch scenes with them, consider that to be ""liking"" a character. This means people may say that they ""like"" Joffrey despite wanting terrible things to happen to him. Unrelated: currently there have been just over 1,500 responses from /r/gameofthrones alone!",86,131,False,self,,,,,

I got to the bathhouse scene in ASOS with Brienne and Jaime. When Jaime was describing how he was the only one who knew that the Mad King planned to burn King's Landing and all the people, it struck me, surely Varys knew.

Jaime describes how he was the only Kingsguard there (so he wouldn't abandon his position to join his father), but Pycelle and Varys were definitely still there. Now Pycelle I could understand him not knowing, it was done in the utmost secrecy and there's no way Pycelle would have found out about it. But, did Varys really not know what the Mad King had planned? He has spies everywhere and knows all these secrets, and he had no idea?

I'm just wondering because Varys says he wants what's best for the realm, he advises the Mad King to not open his gates to Tywin because he knows it will lead to the sacking (and possibly knows it will lead to the burning) of King's Landing. But, was he not doing anything with his network of spies to stop this happening before? In the end, Jaime has to kill the king obviously, along with the pyromancer who was hand, then he later kills the other two pyromancers who knew about the stashes of wildfire. Maybe it's explained later on in the books or something, but it seems weird that Varys didn't know about this, and if he did, he may be much more evil than anyone perceives him to be.",17,39,False,self,,,,,

Anakin / Darth Vader - Theon is taken away from his parents as a child by a bad ass sword fighter. He feels that he deserves more credit than he is given as an adolescent. He turns into a tool for the ""dark side"" voluntarily in an effort to gain power. Immediately afterwards he slaughters children, physically looses something that makes him not fully a man, and his name is changed. There is an internal conflict in him now that he has been reunited with Sansa in Winterfell (however bleak - he did remember her and says she shouldn't be there - assumedly because he wants no harm to come to her). 

Luke Skywalker - Theon wanted to bang his sister, before he knew who she was.

This leads me to believe that Theon will sacrifice himself to possibly kill Reek and save someone he cares for (probably Sansa).

Here are some things that led me to this conclusion:

* Melisandre captured Gendry because he had royal blood and she needed his blood to make Stannis win the War of the 5 Kings, but Sir Davos let Gendry escape.
* When Stannis left Dragonstone with his Army, Melisandre said that it was important to bring Shireen (who also has royal blood) with them.
* During the first episodes of this season we are having a lot of screen time with Shireen; much more than in the previous seasons.
* The show is really making us like the girl. We even had that touching moment between her and her father in episode 4.
* If GoT taught me anything, is that when we really start to like someone (Ned Stark, Robb Stark, Oberyn, etc...) he/she will probably die soon.

I think that maybe during the battle between Stannis and the Boltons, Melisandre will tell Stannis that Shireen must be sacrificed or something alike, to make him win the battle.

So, what do you think? If you don't agree with my theory, why do you think Shireen is so important for this war?",32,17,False,self,,,,,

Until season 4 i was with you. I thought people were overreacting to changes. But with this season it's reached the point of no return. 

My guess is, that the creators got greedy and try everything to be different from the books now. Wether that is because they want to appeal to the ""books are for nerds""crowd or to show people that they can do good storytelling too, i don't know. But i know that if it's the latter it isnt working. I watched 5 episodes now. And the plot makes absolutely no sense. And i don't trust the writers to do a job anywhere close as good as Martin himself. The last 5 episodes gave me no reason to believe they can. 

Spoiler:

I mean killing off Barristan? Are you fu**in serious? Leaving out Tyrions travel by boat and completely leave out Griff and young Griff? They think they are opening up possibilities but all they do is force the story in a really stupid dumbed-down direction. Come one Littlefinger would never be so obvious and retarded at the same time to give his beloved Sansa to Ramsay.... Jamie traveling to Dorne in some stupid quest to save myrcella? You've got to be kidding me.

I don't think watching this show is worth it anymore. I'll always treasure the first three seasons and maybe the first half of the fourth one. But this is just getting worse and worse. It's like seeing a twelveyearold add Transformers and Ninjas to House of Cards because he thought it would be ""awesome"".... Yeah maybe it is. If you're twelve....

On top of that, Brienne has moved on to protecting Sansa (how she plans to, only time will tell, but it seems like she has a plant), and Jaime is on a wild buddy-cop adventure with Best Bro Bronn and the nefarious Sand Snake Sisters.

However, I have an idea of what the show will do with these two characters.

Now, David and Dan have gone on record to say that all of the characters, while their stories may be different, will all reach the same endpoints as they will books. What exactly that means, I don't think any of us will know for a long time.

However, a thought crossed my mind the other night while browsing a thread complaining about show-Jaime.

While thinking about this, and what David and Dan said, it made me think what they're going to do with Jaime's character. A big part of the man is how he changes; Jaime's excursions in the Riverlands make him into a more sympathetic human being, further strains his relationship with Cersei, and makes him realize he is quite an effective leader.

We haven't gotten that in season 5. Clearly, we haven't. Jaime is on this desperate suicide mission with Bronn, risking their lives and a potential war to save his daughter because he feels guilty about being responsible for his father's death and wishes to make amends. On top of that, you have Bronn putting thoughts into his head when Jaime said he wished to die in the arms of the woman he loves, and Bronn shoots back with, ""And is that what she wants?"" Throw all that together and you got a man with a crisis.

Here's what I think will happen with his story: with or without Myrcella, Jaime will make it back to King's Landing, and knowing this show and how the actual story has gone, probably a failure and feeling more useless than ever. When he returns, he'll find that Cersei has fucked up royally, turned into a complete tyrant, plunged King's Landing into anarchy and likely further dragged the Lannister name into the mud than it was before, which if you'll remember the first episode of the season he advised her to specifically be wary of.

I think from there, for season 6, Jaime will leave King's Landing to calm down the Riverlands with the rest of his family and the armies of the Westerlands. This is where Jaime's growth will occur as it did in the books, and he pushes himself further and further away from Cersei. Jump over to Brienne, where she will presumably still be alive after the Battle of Ice. Whoever wins, she'll still live and perhaps start heading south, either with Stannis's army or alone/with Podrick should the Boltons prove victorious.

Now here's why I brought up Stoneheart. Going back to what I said, Stoneheart hasn't done enough in the books to warrant a return of Michelle Farley just for a handful of scenes every few episodes. But bring her back when she'll become relevant to the overall plot, and have the confrontation between Brienne and Jaime, and I think the show has found a logical way to work in this story arc.

Of course, this is all speculation. None of us have any idea where the show is going, and honestly, I'd be fine if they still cut out Lady Stoneheart. I just want Jaime to have his character development, dammit!",18,23,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure what one specific reason seals it. He has no real backstory beyond 'Being a really good killer'? His replacement actor is like switching to the cheaper, stale off-brand version of your favorite soda in terms of acting ability or at least appearance? He went from some cocky, smug guy to Yet Another Generic Looking Guy With Stubble. He got into Daeny's underwear way too easily? His romance with her has been lackluster? He's contributed little to nothing to the overall plot, beyond cutting off some heads?

2545,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-5-14,2015,5,14,16,35x9g5,self.gameofthrones,[NO SPOILERS] A theory on the Double-Ds (show-runners) vs. George (author),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/35x9g5/no_spoilers_a_theory_on_the_doubleds_showrunners/,[deleted],1431588895,"TD;LR The Show runner's (David Benioff and D.B. Weiss) don't want to work on the show anymore, or, at least as long as George/HBO wants it to run. 

I'm sure people have speculated on this before but if you just put all the readily available facts together:

1. George, for the most part, hasn't had any major success in his screenwriting and Hollywood career. It's his unfortunate run in screenwriting that prompted him to write novels and the book series in question, in the first place (or there abouts, paraphrasing history I know).

2. Both David and Daniel come from creative backgrounds. David especially enjoyed pretty decent success with his novels 25th Hour (then adapted the film's screenplay and went on to write major projects like Troy) whilst Daniel only has a few major works, most specifically a great book (or so I'm told) so I can't speculate too much on Daniel, but I will anyway. Suffice to say both men are great creative individuals in their own right. They have been accepted pretty well into Hollywood, and for the most part, after GOT is over, will have their pick of the litter in terms of work or what they want to do.

3. Who ALWAYS talks about GOT? George. How often do you hear DB Weiss or David Benioff talk about the show? Do they ever seem happy? Honestly. Every interview I've seen they look exhausted and very serious. But who loves to talk about it? George. It's his baby, totally understandable. (Statement of Hyperbole, but if you look at them all it's true...)

4. George's time to shine. The Double-Ds are running around the world, overseeing photography in 3 or 4 countries, whilst also adapting the series. It's a full year round job. And essentially they're making George look good. And he's loving it. Every interview, Every Fan Convention (not to say that he didn't do these before the show got popular, but it certainly has increased since) he's there. Not writing the books, but just chatting about it with the fans... (Now I start to really theorise)

5. The Double-D's are dying creatively. Don't get me wrong, I think any creative person, especially OUTSIDE the industry would DIE for the job. But imagine having it. Really, not the giddy part of you working on GOT, but the fact that this is your life now. This is your responsibility. Because if it sucks or the people don't like it.  They get blamed. Not George. These two men quite literally are overseeing the production of the most popular television show on the planet right now, or at least in the western hemisphere.
The Double-D's pitched GOT back in 2006. They began PreProduction in 2007. That's EIGHT years ago.
How many of us here have held a job for EIGHT years and loved every minute of it? Because as much as it is being creative and all that, it's still a job, and a bloody hard one. 
Think of this way, George doesn't mind how long it takes, like I said it's his baby. He was born to write A Song of Ice and Fire and he will die writing a Song of Ice and Fire (as a book fan I hope to the seven or the many faced, the drowned or the burning, whom ever, that doesn't happen). Hell, earlier this year he was saying he wanted 10 seasons and a movie. HBO (which is a company that makes money of this, let's not forget) likes the sound of that. Maybe not the movie, but definitely the 10 seasons. 
I believe what the Double-Ds are doing now (killing of characters, severing and neutering story lines left right and f***ing center) is a sort of semi revolt to George.
They know where the show is going. They are busy and have nearly spent a DECADE (25% of their half lived lives, both men in their early forties) working on this one creative property.... which isn't even theirs. Let that sink in. They have essentially spent (When the show is over no doubt will be) over a decade bringing this world to life and essentially fulfilling George RR Martin's lifelong wishes for success and fame (of his work!) in Hollywood. 

GOT will always be GRRM. Twenty years from now people will look back and remember GOT and GRRM. They won't remember the Double-Ds unless you're reminded on a movie poster. Want me to prove it? Who directed the first Harry Potter? Or the Last Four? I know we all know undisputedly who directed the Third (if you're a film buff). Actually do you know there were only two writers in that WHOLE series, one of which wrote SEVEN of the EIGHT films. What's his name? But, we all remember who JK Rowling is don't we....

6. George realizes the dream is coming to an end. For the last few years he's been neglecting writing the books or at least with the work ethic he once had still in semi obscurity, now he's just lapping up all the attention and talk show spots he can. Also blabbing about 10 seasons and a movie, expanding the books even more and running the show longer!
The Double-D's are done. They know how it ends. They're not going to wait and certainly not going to do 10 seasons. They're aiming for 7. So they'll surpass and simultaneously cover books 4 (AFFC) and 5 (ADWD) - do the majority of what probably will be book 6 in season 6 (hate my life) and then end on season 7. Why 7? Because it's a nice odd number and for TV and Films you have to end on an odd number... everything looks better that way, even down to DVD packaging (weird I know) and they're not doing 10, which means probably not 9 and since we can't do 8 it makes sense (especially with the books) that they'd do it in 7 seasons. 

7. The last marathon for George: Upon realising that the show will be done in about three years (an extra year or two for residual zeitgeist) he hit the brakes on all tours and receded back to his house to finish the next book. To get it out in time.
And not just for the fans. For himself and his relevancy, and also in a hopes to prolong the show. 

If George can get the book out before the next season and stuff a whole lot of turns and twists in there, it will FORCE David and Dan to extend the show, in turn, keeping George well known. If George doesn't release the next book (not the last, that won't happen... but at least the 6th book) whilst the show is still running it will run right past him. And he will shrink back to obscurity, writing a story that we all KNOW THE ENDING TO.

So. TD;LR Double-D's are over making someone else famous and working on something that isn't theirs (originally) and are hating it, wanting to move on to their own work. Whilst George, lapping up all the fame he's always wanted, has neglected writing the books and has now realised he needs to finish the next if he can continue being in the spot light. 

Just a theory. But, if you look at the interview's, press releases and blog posts of people involved... the dots start to connect a little.

I've never read the books, and when I discovered GoT, I found it really interesting for this successful mix of ""big plan"" plot (Stark vs Lannisters, True heir vs Incest heir, The exiled girl who wants to come back, the walkers that will come (one day maybe)) and ""chaotic event that could change almost everything"" (Let's kill some major characters !).

But recently, I'm continuously losing interest for the shows. It's not a bad thing, I mean, I don't intend to convince you that is less (or fewer ? Stannis, help me, I'm not native english speaker) interesting that it was before. But what I really want from you, is to tell me that everything is somewhat linked, even if you have to spoil me the last sentences of the last book release. For example, I was hyped for Bran at the S4 final... But now I'm even asking myself if it matters. Dragons does matter at some point ? Or is it just here to be the ""cool stuff"" ? Does at some point, Daenarys really come back to Westeros ? Is winter come or is still coming (one day, maybe) ? Arya choice to join Jaqen has some consequences or is it just a ""cool side story ?"". Is there a link between all the people who believe in that ""Lord of light"" that cast more shadows than light ?

And the last but not the least : Gendry does he matters, or was it just like a disposable character which I should skip scene with the next time I'll look previous seasons ? I thought his royal blood made him more special than just give us sex scene with that hot redhead sorceress.

&gt; They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. 

&gt;The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies;
 
&gt;The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned

&gt;Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. 

&gt;A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned

&gt;The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned.

&gt;The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.

But I feel the end of the verse doesn't seem to conclude it rhythmically. Is this just me not understanding lyric poetry and overanalysing things, or might that have a meaning? Like a lost line of this verse, or a symbol that Valyria is not truly ended. That would of course mean it was written by someone who knew more about the Doom and not just some poet, but it might be possible...
Any book readers know more about this verse? Is it even in the books?

He found himself born anew twice in the show thus far (losing fingers to becoming right hand of Stannis, and a birth from fire at the Battle of Blackwater) and in the books (his false death to the Frey's and Lannisters). Couldn't it be possible that while yes Stannis is the one true king of Westeros, but that Ser Davos is going to be the one to defeat the White Walkers?

Meanwhile he is making Sansa his potential ally in the north, and making the Boltons and Sersi less suspicious of him by loyally delivering Sansa. And now he is waiting for the result of the war between Stannis and Roose. Basically he is betting on both sides.

There is a single reason why his plan doesn't make sense:  because we believe he truly loves Sansa, like he did Cat.  His love for her is the only true motive/desire we know about LF (well, and his desire for power).  But if he really cares for her, it's insane to give her over to the Boltons, even temporarily.  Even if LF is truly clueless about Ramsey (which also seems unlikely given his character), he flat-out tells Sansa that Roose is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.  WTF is he thinking?!  

Why it DOES/CAN make sense:  If we are wrong about LF and he would willingly use Sansa as a pawn in a dangerous plan, everything else about his plan is perfectly believeable.  As smart as LF is, he would definitely hedge his bets in the upcoming war of the north.  He may truly believes Stannis has the #'s and supplies to win, but this way if something unexpected happens, he still has favor w/ the Boltons for giving them Sansa.  Regardless of the outcome, his stock goes up.  

It's such a glaring mistake that I'm guessing the show wants us to believe that 1). he loves power more than Sansa or 2). he doesn't really love her.  So I'll be pretty pissed if they later show him doting on her again (I'm sure it'll happen).  It doesn't add up.  ",21,2,False,self,,,,,

Before continuing to the next few episodes/season 1, I wanted to get yall's opinion on which ""guide"" style/method I should continue with.

---------------------------

**Option 1:** The original, from the thread linked above. [Click here.](http://imgur.com/a/Sik96) It shows new characters in the order in which they appear in a given episode, and is posted to imgur and uses imgur ""Description"" fields for the text.

**Option 2:** My new one. [Click here.](http://i.imgur.com/q22OPoU.png) This involves showing each ""House"" or ""Region"", put together in MS Paint, with descriptions and everything below each character. I can do this for Lannister and Baratheon/Royal Family as well, I just haven't yet. I like how it turned out appearance-wise, but my concern is screen-space/complications in future episodes when a lot more permanent/important characters are introduced.

---------------------------------

Anyway... thoughts? Obviously bear in mind this is designed for new show-watchers' ease of understanding, not *necessarily* which simply LOOKS better.

The unexpected ally quote is straight from the description of Season 5 Episode 8: Hardhome. This is the episode that the battle of Hardhome is going to take place and apparently Jon is supposed to gain an unexpected ally. I think that the ally is White Walkers. I'll explain with some evidence.

In this screen cap from 1 minute and 41 seconds into the official Season 5 trailer we se a Thenn wildling standing off with someone (or something) that moves in-front of the pov of the viewer and the clip is rather short. You've probably seen this shot before and thought that the Thenn is standing off with Nights Watch members and passed it off as nothing. But why do the Wildings in the background look shocked? Why aren't they preparing for battle like the vicious savages they are? It's because they're in awe at the sight of a White Walker. We see why I say this in the next picture.

http://i.imgur.com/sRSgXc8.png

This second screeshot is taken from a Game of Thrones stunt video that was uploaded back in March. In the screenshot we see two stunt-men. One of them is holding a prop that is modelled exactly like the axe that the Thenn was holding in the first screenshot. The second stunt-man is also holding a weapon. That weapon it a crystal ice White Walker sword. The Thenn and the White Walker will fight one-on-one whilst all of the Wildings from the first screenshot watch is shock. It is also to be noted that the White Walker will fight one handed. The sword is bigger than the two handed Thenns battle axe, so that proves that it isn't a human that the Thenn is fighting.

Hopefully my prediction is accurate, or else I'm going to look a fool. And hopefully you now believe me too. This battle could take place during or after the Nights Watch and Wildling battle as we do see Jon fighting Tormund one-on-one in the same video. Will the White Walkers be Jons ""unexpected ally""? I sure hope so, that battle would be bad ass!

I can completely understand that concessions need to be made when adapting books to television/film, especially one at the scale of ASOIAF, but the way the show is headed feels like D&amp;D are making fan fiction, and just slotting in key markers from GRRM's material in order for it to be considered an adaption!

Season 1 is the only season that I can confidently say I thought was amazing as a whole. Sure, there were some amazing *moments* in the seasons succeeding that one, but I just feel that compared to season 1, the others have been relatively hollow overall.

I suppose my disappointment comes not from the fact that D&amp;D are making changes to ensure that the TV show works in its format (for example, to cater for lack of inner-dialogue); my disappointment is that the show has so much potential which it isn't meeting in order to... what? Remain cool by including heaps of nudity and fight sequences? For example, Jaime is meant have a complete turnaround and become the man that as a boy Jaime wanted to be, but instead, he's off playing James Bond in Dorne with Bronne! In fact, now that I mention it, Bronne was clearly kept on because he was so popular with the masses, but he doesn't actually contribute to the core of the story! D&amp;D are wasting time on crowd-pleasing fluff, rather than making something beautiful.

I suppose what I'm saying is that when GRRM wrote the ""Red Wedding"", he didn't do it because it would make people happy; he did it because that's where the story needed to go. D&amp;D seem to be deviating in ways to keep viewership while loosely working in the main plot points, rather than focusing on enhancing the main plot points with the time they have.

I don't know... It's late and I'm grumpy, so maybe I'm being a little unfair. I just don't know how much more time I want to invest watching something that frustrates me (that potential man!). I'll still post this though as I'm curious to hear what others think (including the brave TV show viewers who clicked an [ALL SPOILERS] thread)",7,0,False,self,,,,,

In Ep5, we get the psychopath version of this scene when Roose talks about how he barely resisted murdering everyone involved in Ramsay's birth but eventually decided to keep him for much the same reason as Stannis fought for Shereen.  

Are either of these scenes in the books?  If so, are they juxtaposed so abruptly against each other?

The whole purpose of adding a random person could have just been fan service, but honestly I don't know if D&amp;D are interested in doing that so blatantly without any further purpose.  Could this have been an introduction to a future character?  We know that Rickon and Osha went off somewhere and they MIGHT have either accidentally or intentionally gone off to the Mormonts.

Now the only thing that could be ruining this is, if I remember correctly, they were planning on going to the Last Hearth of house Umber.  Could there be a reason they mislead Bran? Or could there be a reason they would be diverted?  The last hearth is closer to the Dreadfort, so maybe they ran into Boltons and had to make for another location?",15,14,False,self,,,,,

How did this just occur to me after having watched the whole series through season 4 like 10 times...

Does Sansa know that Baelish betrayed her father?  If so, was it addressed in the show and I'm not remembering? If not, who has that information that could get it back to Sansa?  Doesn't seem terribly tin foil worthy to think that this will come up down the road.  With Baelish holding/helping Sansa, Cersei likely still wants her dead, if Cersei finds out he has Sansa, etc etc.

I have to assume it was never addressed and that's why I'm not remembering if it had.

I'm sure you've heard of the [controversial sansa chapter remark](http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/george-rr-martin-fans-have-three-meals-and-drinks.html). 

 I have an alternative theory about what it could be, given most people are hedging their bets on [these ideas](#g ""a rape or murder scene including Sansa and Littlefinger, or Sansa murdering Robert Arryn"")

[Assuming the Battle for the North Theory](#g ""George R.R Martin has assimilated plenty of historical events within our universe with events within the Westerosi universe (i.e. The Red Wedding being a nod toward The Black Dinner). This thematic trend has led many to expect Stannis to employ the tactic of luring the Frey/Bolton army over the frozen lake forcing it to collapse beneath them, as this would loosely link back to the Battle of the Ice between the Teutonic Knights, and the Republic of Novgorod in 1242"")

[my theory is this](#g ""My guess is that this 'controversy' Sansa Stark will be involved in maybe killing (burning involved?) all the Boltens that remain in Winterfell when Roose looses the battle to Stannis. I noticed in the show many people giving Sansa the wink nod about being loyal to the North, so I'm sure Sansa is going to have to make a move after the Bolten army is wiped out and she's alone in the North."")",4,7,False,default,,,,,

Yes, it was most likely Joffrey who gave the order, but he couldn't have done it alone.

- Ros reminds Janos Slynt that the brothel is owned by Littlefinger. Janos Slynt, unlike Joffrey, understands how dangerous Littlefinger is. Slynt responds, saying that ""the orders come from someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks"" (i.e. Littlefinger)

- Joffrey simply doesn't have the resources to hunt down all twenty of Robert's bastards. Finding them would take a huge spy network, the kind of network that only three people possess in King's Landing at this point in time whom Joffrey knows. Cersei, Varys and Littlefinger. Cersei later states in a conversation with Tyrion that she didn't want the bastards to die, and I don't think Varys would be up for it. So who does that leave us with?

- We learn in season 3 that Joffrey and Littlefinger are pretty close, seeing as Joffrey doesn't mind asking Littlefinger if he can murder one of his prostitutes.

- But why would Littlefinger do this? That's what's stumping me. I don't think Joffrey's companionship is enough to persuade him. But then again, he did get Harrenhal and LP of the Riverlands out of his alliance with the Lannisters.

Sansa Stark and Ramsay are following a changed storyline as is Jaime Lannister. The storyline I wish to explore is that of Tyrions. His interactions with the possible last male heir to the House Targaryen, Rhaegars supposedly deceased son Aegon.

The TV show seems to have taken this story out of the mix. That's what it looks like anyway. Quite disappointing since it was my personal favourite. Now with Mormonts story intertwined with Tyrions his fate has also changed from the books.

I ask only this. Your thoughts on the matter of what could have been Aegon VI  and how the show will follow on with Tyrion.

Maybe a darker, less striking shade of purple could have been used? The effect is staggeringly good. She has the silver-white hair already but the Valyrians *should* stand out more, I feel. She's one of the last of a legendary empire, after all. 

Hell, even go for a more magical angle where her eyes are normally a dark purple but shine a *little* brighter when she's angry? *shrugs*

My question is if they were North of the Wall how could he get to Winterfell without crossing the wall?

At first when i watched the show i thought that they were walking in the forest south of the wall so that made sense to me, but now i started to read the books, im in the second book now and there it is said that they crossed Craster's Keep which is north of the wall so that's why i wondered.",14,7,False,self,,,,,

It's been pointed out many times that Ned was one of, if not the most honorable men in all of Westeros. It makes it easier to believe that he would not have cheated on Cat during Robert's Rebellion, but he would have the character to take in someone else's child and raise him as his own.  For a while, I thought maybe he was the son of Robert and Lyanna Stark; however, after this last episode, there were a lot of parrarels made towards the Targaryens, and even towards Rhaegar raping Lyanna. A lot of Targaryen talk at Castle Black, with Jon Snow being at the center of the frame during the dialouge.  Not to mention the whole thing with Lady Milisandre (possible hint he has King's Blood). Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm really starting to believe Jon is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark. Did anyone else see anything similar to me, or have your own theories?

EDIT:  
A lot of people are saying that they don't understand how I and others are reacting so adversely to that scene. People have been commenting that much of the gore on this show, or even Dany's rape by Drogo in Season 1 hit them just as hard, if not harder.
What got me here is that we've spent 5 Season watching a character grow up and gain maturity. She has gone from a scared, naive girl used as a King's plaything, to a potential Player / Protagonist in her own right. Tonight we saw her raped by the most charismatically maniacal character in recent television history.
I've become desensitized to the violence and death on this show, but rape is a bit different. Its still a taboo subject and not explored much in popular culture. Hearing Sansa raped by Ramsay after she finally seems to gain independence as Theon/Reek helplessly watches was painful in a new way to this show. Never before have we seen a character work her way from helplessness to independence, only to fall back down the latter. Also, I was watching the first episode again recently, and I still have the image of 13 year old Sophie Turner in my head. God, this show is fucking brutal",233,0,False,self,,,,,

 Yes it's in Ramsey's character to do so, but what narrative are we furthering? We get it, he's not human, that was fucking horrible.

Sure, she definitely put the girl out of her misery in what I assume to be a painless manner, but she did lie to give this girl some false sense of hope. Besides posing as a boy, which is another lie, what other big lies has she told up to this point? As of now, I would consider her lying to the girl the biggest/most notable lie she's told.

I have not read the books, and I still find the show to be entertaining, but it's getting harder and harder to watch. One of my favorite things about great television is immersion. I love when a show doesn't feel contrived, it feels as if the plot is possible/reasonable, given the development of the characters and the context of the world in which they reside.

For game of thrones, this means I'm happy to accept dragons, magic, and the other fantasy aspects. But so many decisions being made by characters feels more like lazy writing, used simply because it's convenient and creates drama, instead of reasonable decisions you would expect character to make after watching them for 5 seasons. Not too mention, I'd appreciate some limitations on the number of outrageously improbable events from occurring.

For example, I just watched [S6][E06] and found a lot of disappointment.

The newly married, and presumably in-love king, still hasn't done anything about his brother-in-law being in-prisoned? I get that he's anti-violence, but why not just revoke the decree, and disband the faithful army (apparently they were disarmed 100 years ago)? And now the show doubles-down, and the queen is imprisoned? I don't feel like the king is that worthless and unwilling to demand what he wants.

As for Cersei, while not as intelligent as her late father, she isn't completely moronic. She has to realize that marginalizing her families most powerful ""ally"" (the Tyrells), helping put her son's wife in prison (whom the people of King's Landing also love), and empowering the faithful, while her own incest is well-known, is all going to end poorly for her. Her best outcome, is that her son hates her. It all makes me find her entire scheme feels rather contrived.

Not out of character, but this little side-plot of Tyrion being kidnapped keeps adding improbability after improbability. First Jorah somehow runs into Tyrion in Volantis. Then they run into a greyscale ambush. Then they run into pirates who've anchored nearby and are both abducted. Too many improbable things happening for my taste.

Speaking of improbable, Bronn and Jaime waltz (seemingly without any issue) into the palace gardens to kidnap/rescue the princess? Wait! It's going to get crazy people! The three ladies of Oberyn's vengeance run in at exactly the same time! It's gonna get cray cray up in here! Ugh.

One more and I'm end my rant. Reek. There was clearly some time when we weren't sure how brainwashed Theon was. Did he completely suppress his prior life? But it's become clear that he still remembers his past, and despises Ramsay. Most recently, in [S6][E06] we see him crying while Sansa is raped by Ramsay. I realize Theon went through hell, but the fact that he's never taken advantage of the endless opportunities he's had to kill Ramsay is starting to get silly. All he has to do is slit his throat, and he could just walk out of the town, since he has the freedom to walk around freely.

At Castle Black - Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander, then we get five episodes of him saying he won't join Stannis in attacking Winterfell.
At Meereen - Dany has trouble ruling the city. Politics. Not terribly exciting stuff.
Tyrion goes from being dragged around by Varys to being dragged around by Jorah.
Jamie and Bronn spend episodes traveling to Dorne and finally have a small, anticlimactic fight before being captured.
Brienne finds Sansa and then disappears for episodes.
Sansa gets dragged around, and then, well... tonight.
Reek keeps seemingly breaking a bit and returning to being Theon, but then he just watches as Ramsay has his way with Sansa.
Kings Landing is sort of interesting at least. Power plays and whatnot.
Arya goes to Bravos and scrubs floors and bodies for six episodes.

It just seems like nothing is happening. Are the last four episodes going to be jam-packed with exciting stuff or will the trend continue?",10,0,False,default,,,,,

Hell, Ramsay himself has tortured Theon for half a season, sicked hungry dogs on a poor girl just on Myranda's whim, murdered the Ironborn who all agreed to surrender... I was expecting Walda to get stabbed in the baby or something. But frequent flayer Ramsay commits rape (in a ceremony where he's supposed to consumate his marriage for his house no matter what)? Not that big a deal for me.


Raping Sansa in front of Theon doesn't shock me nor turn my stomach. Maybe I don't feel he and Sansa had that much of a connection, since they've never spoken on the show (can anyone confirm?). Now making Robb watch, that might have gotten a rise out of me. I did have a tiny soft spot since it's one of the Starks who we love. But we've seen Sansa abused for three seasons. 


Plus, it's Ramsay. He's a psychopath... what did you all think would happen on their wedding night, *a happy ending*? I think you know how that goes.

EDIT: I do believe this might just be a result of overhyping myself. Also I do kinda feel bad now, not for the obvious reason, but more so because Sansa was building herself up again to be this power move maker next to Petyr, and here she is back to being someone's plaything.

But I think we *are* seeing her as a player. Here's how I see it

S5E3: ""I won't force you to do anything... ...say the word and we'll turn the horses around..."" -Petyr Baelish

Sansa chose to go forward with Petyr's plan so that she was in a position to avenge her family. She was fully aware that the plan included her being married. She's smart enough to know that Not all men are like Tyrion, and Ramsay will consumate the marriage on his wedding night. She actually, *went forward with this plan, knowing she'd likely* be raped.

I think it's a huge character development arc. We saw some of her sass when she returned Myranda's shit. I bet we'll see more going forward. But I look at it like this. She wants to revenge, and THIS is what she's willing to do to get it. I think it's very powerful. despite the stark (pun not intended) contrast with this episodes title ""unbowed, unbent, unbroken"" it fits much more with last weeks title: ""Kill the Boy"" or in this case ""Kill the Girl""

EDIT:
Okay, I'm not trying to start a god-damned holy war here. Yes, just because they are married does not make it consenual. That's not actually even what I said. What I said what, she chose to go forward with this plan, knowing what it entails.

So fine, it's rape. She didn't enjoy it, she didn't want to if she could have avoided it. It sucks. It was hard for us to watch. It was hard for her to go through, and given the choice I think it's clear she didn't want to do it. That wasn't what I was saying. I'm so sorry it came off that way. Please don't cut my nuts off. 

I just think it's very insulting to her character to consider her ""Just another victim."" She is so commited to hurting those who hurt her family she's put herself in a position to be abused more to pull it off. I think it's a huge testement to how much she's grown, and what she's willing to risk being subjected to, to get what she wants.",46,125,False,self,,,,,

I've been justifying continuing to watch every week, telling myself that it's just a different story, a different world in the same multiverse.  I've been taking comfort in awesome moments like the beheading of Janos Slynt, and... well it's hard to think of anything else they've done even close to right.

In an adaptation, changes have to be made.  What kind of sick fucks read the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series and decides Sansa Stark needs to get raped by Ramsey Bolton. 

The Grey Worm/Missandei relationship is *bad*. The added fight scenes are *bad.*  From Bolton/Yara to the Sand Snakes with their impossibly corny whip fighting vs. Bronn, it's all been just terrible.

The hamfisted anti-gay Sparrows are ridiculous.  Just how the fuck did they walk in and grab Loras out of the Red Keep again?

Brienne running into the Hound and Bronn/Jamie running into the Sand Snakes has all the narrative credibility of a fucking Scooby Doo episode.

It's not that their making changes, it's that the changes are idiotic.  They thought they could outdo George.  They didn't want to tell the fantasy story where Brienne takes Jamie to a resurrected Catelyn Stark.  

Instead they wanted to do a shitty medieval sope opera/soft-core rape porn with cute girls swinging double daggers taking the place of the truly epic fight scenes of the last four seasons.  

When these two gents who think they're better writers than Martin rearranged everything, did they forget to save some interesting fights for season 4?

I am not easily ""triggered.""  I'm usually on the other side of these arguments, but the feminists are going to be right this time.  I don't care what the justification is.  It's just too rapey.  Instead of violence against women being a sad fact of life in a greater story, it's the whole fucking focus now.

The ending scene. Maybe I'm kneejerking too hard. Maybe I'll be back next week. But that scene hurt. Not like the Red Wedding. Not like Ned's Death. Not like any of the tragic events thus far. 

It made me ask ""why do I even watch this show?"" 

And then the answers come. The same reason I love the books-it's well written, it makes you think about people and how we treat each other, it's both a magical fantasy world and a tale of very human flaws. 

But this hurts too much. 

I can't get it out of my head. Maybe I just need to sleep on it. Maybe I'll be willing to accept it as a well-placed advancement of the plot in time.  Alfie Allen's acting was phenomenal after all. But it's been a couple hours now and I'm still lying in bed and every time I think I'm done with it I sit up like I've been struck and I come back to that scene. I've been alternating between holding back tears to just staring at my bedroom wall. I don't know how long I'm going to stay up like this tonight.

And you know what? It's starting to feel like it just isn't worth it. I've never been disappointed in the books. And maybe the problem is the medium. Picturing rape is different than a depiction. But the show's writing feels like it's dropping off. The entire Dorne plot is a trainwreck. They've abandoned half of Tyrion's character in cutting out Tysha. I watch this show FOR the writing. A poorly written comedy can at least make me chuckle from time to time. And that's not to say this scene in particular isn't well written.

 I know there's a payoff. I know they're only using this to get you really emotionally involved in the story. And I was excited to watch Cersei indiscriminately fuck everything up in King's Landing. It was my favorite plot line of books 4/5. I love her POV chapters.

But thinking about the story that the character is going through, wedding into a family she hated because she knows the end game is ultimate vengeance and retaking her homeland, was her ""bedding"" not a part of the plan?

She's a woman of Westeros. She knew *exactly* what was going to happen the moment they returned from the Godswood. This was the plan she agreed to with Littlefinger. She was going to have sex with Ramsay. No, she didn't expect how fucked up that sex would be, but she was going to lose her maidenhood that night however it happened. 

There was no way around that unless viewers were expecting a jump the shark kind of moment of heroicism from Reek that the show has repeatedly expressed is not a part of its DNA.

And this also does *not* hinder her character development. She is right in the thick of playing the Game. It's just that unlike the men of Westeros, the women *do* have to use their bodies in a sexual manner along the way. It's a shit reality, but they live in a *very* shit world. Her current play is Ramsay's wife, and she'll continue to be bedded until the time comes that she doesn't need to allow it anymore.

I more and more fall in this camp as well.

I am not saying ""This show sucks now"". There are still great characters and scenes that are great television but in totality the show seems to be losing steam. The biggest complaint is the pace; people are saying the pace is slow but I only partially disagree. I think the problem is the pace is scatter brained. Things just seem to be all over the place. The biggest problem and maybe the most 'alarming' is that the entire 'schtick' is getting....boring. It feels like we have seen this all before and it seems to just be setting it up to happen again. 

Character development this season has been pretty damn pathetic. 

Oh and the Dorne/Sand Snakes has been maybe the worst part of the show's entire run. The failed 'rescue' scene was semi-laughable. It was like a scene from a B-Movie. It was so bad it was bewildering because it was so out of place. The fight scene was about as bad as a High School play and the camera work (Why did we keep getting 0.5 second shots of her ""OMG he is hurt!"" face every 5 seconds?) was comical. I think they should just delete that entire 3-4 minutes in all future reruns and just put in a black screen writing out what happened in the scene. 

In all fairness I have heard from multiple book readers that the last 2 books in a Song of Ice and Fire (Which are actually, really ONE book broken in two as they happen at the same time) were by far the worst in the series. Actually the last 2 books are the ONLY books I've ever heard a reader of ASOIAF complain about. I know 2 die hard readers who actually stopped reading half way through they said they were so bad. So MAYBE part of the problem of this season is the source material?

He's read all of the books and I'm still working through them.  He's been an avid fan for some time, and he's starting to see a pattern emerging in the show.  One of his major criticisms of the new season is that it's starting to feel like a fanfiction with the removal of many of the older, complex characters being replaced with younger and undeveloped or underdeveloped characters.  A prime example of this would be the death of Barristan Selmy whereas Greyworm continues on to receive exposition (although his dialogue felt pretty clich when he awoke).  One of the reasons that my boyfriend has loved the show in addition to the books, is that he feels that the breadth of age in characters on the screen lends a layer of complexity and it's one of the few shows to really showcase older actors/actresses. Now, it's starting to veer away from that and replace them with younger, less developed characters who, quite frankly, we find it difficult to care about.  There are fewer and fewer older characters left in the series with each passing episode and I guess I'm not fully understanding their reasoning for tightening up the ranks. I feel like it'd be one thing if the story were too complex with the number of players, but I feel like for each character that's removed 1 or 2 more are added.

Additionally, another factor we're both struggling with is what we're perceiving as poor writing in this season.  Ex: Stannis the Daddis, why is he in the North?  In the books, he takes to the North because he needs to recruit for his army after the crushing defeat at Kings Landing.  In the show, Littlefinger flat out says he's got the largest army.  So why is he in the North at all?  Why does Greyworm prevent the Sons of the Harpy from slicing Barristan's throat when he winds up dying anyway?  Perhaps if Barristan had some last words with Daenerys it'd make sense, but he doesn't.  Why do the Sand Snakes feel so... flat, particularly if they're major players in this new season?  Why does this new thing with Sansa &amp; the Boltons feel so... awkward?  And how 'bout the plot line with Loras feeling so forced?  Those are just a few of the questions we've been pondering after episodes have wrapped up.   

Is anyone else feeling similarly, and if so, what's your take?  If not, can anyone help me to see the light? ",1,1,False,default,,,,,

Personally, I feel that Ramsay Snow is the worst thing to happen to Game of Thrones. His plot-line has been endless, excessive, repetitive torture that adds little to the show other than filling the Joffrey villain space and serving as a device to transform Theon to Reek (which could have been accomplished in 25% of the screen time that we had to endure). In short, it feels like torture porn. Un-earned, un-ending misery.

Let me explain:

1) In the first two seasons, the show struck a perfect balance between the gruesome/brutal content, and the more triumphant, dramatic, and humorous tones. But in seasons 3, 4, and 5, when Ramsay showed up to torture Theon again and again, kill a girl with dogs, and now degrade and rape Sansa (none of things were explicitly depicted in the books, I believe...correct me if I'm wrong) the scales have tipped to the dark brutality in a potentially permanent and unfixable way. 

2) I feel like Benioff and Weiss are trying to make Ramsay a protagonist, as if we are supposed to be emotionally moved by his relationship with his depraved and evil father, with his ascension out of bastard-dom. I'm not engaged with any of it, it just makes me angry and frustrated at the show creators. 

3) I also think that Iwan Rheon overacts Ramsay to such an extreme degree. He's just batshit, jumping-off-the-walls, bug-eyed crazy, and it's not human or believable to me. It's just silly and over-the-top.

4) It seems that he exists to be a plot complication for Theon, and now Sansa, just to slow the story down and drag out the misery. I'm tired of it and I want it to end.

He's read all of the books and I'm still working through them. He's been an avid fan for some time, and he's starting to see a pattern emerging in the show. One of his major criticisms of the new season is that it's starting to feel like a fanfiction with the removal of many of the older, complex characters being replaced with younger and undeveloped or underdeveloped characters. A prime example of this would be the death of Barristan Selmy whereas Greyworm continues on to receive exposition (although his dialogue felt pretty clich when he awoke). One of the reasons that my boyfriend has loved the show in addition to the books, is that he feels that the breadth of age in characters on the screen lends a layer of complexity and it's one of the few shows to really showcase older actors/actresses. Now, it's starting to veer away from that and replace them with younger, less developed characters who, quite frankly, we find it difficult to care about. There are fewer and fewer older characters left in the series with each passing episode and I guess I'm not fully understanding their reasoning for tightening up the ranks. I feel like it'd be one thing if the story were too complex with the number of players, but I feel like for each character that's removed 1 or 2 more are added.

Additionally, another factor we're both struggling with is what we're perceiving as poor writing in this season. Ex: Stannis the Daddis, why is he in the North? In the books, he takes to the North because he needs to recruit for his army after the crushing defeat at Kings Landing. In the show, Littlefinger flat out says he's got the largest army. So why is he in the North at all? Why does Greyworm prevent the Sons of the Harpy from slicing Barristan's throat when he winds up dying anyway? Perhaps if Barristan had some last words with Daenerys it'd make sense, but he doesn't. Why do the Sand Snakes feel so... flat, particularly if they're major players in this new season? Why does this new thing with Sansa &amp; the Boltons feel so... awkward? And how 'bout the plot line with Loras feeling so forced? Those are just a few of the questions we've been pondering after episodes have wrapped up.

Is anyone else feeling similarly, and if so, what's your take? If not, can anyone help me to see the light?",1,2,False,self,,,,,

With that in mind, the scene should have played out differently to stop painting her as a victim in every situation she's in.

When Ramsay told Reek he was staying, Sansa should have paused, followed by Ramsey stating that he hates asking a second time before she cuts him off and clearly states, ""No."" Ramsay, shocked, asks ""What?"" ""I'm not going to with him in here.""

Ramsay smacks her across the face, what he assumes is the end to that discussion. Sansa, having become accustomed to beatings from men much bigger than Ramsay, rises again, and sternly states she's not going to consummate the marriage with Reek in the room. Ramsay is shocked that his abuse didn't even phase her and strikes her again. When she still states clearly that she doesn't wish Reek to stay, Ramsey bids him away. He's at a loss that she didn't immediately bend to his will. He doesn't comprehend, and finds it alluring and curious.

Sansa shuts the door, and behind a bruised face, smiles and tells him that now they can begin. Reek, outside the door, can hear the ambiguously painful noises.


This keeps Sansa out of the role of a victim, gives Ramsey still a lot of villain cred, is arguably more shocking because of the unmet expectations, and provides a much more complex and intriguing relationship between the two. Ramsey is used to getting what he wants, and Sansa should be the character that is able to tactfully stand up to him and withstand the physical pain he would try to inflict on her.

I expected dogs.

I'm not downplaying what happened to Sansa. But didn't S3 portray the mass rape of every single one of Craster's daughters? *On screen.*

Did we forget? Do we not give a shit about that because they were extras? What, it wasn't as bad because Theon wasn't watching? 

Ramsay hunted down Tandsy and had her eaten alive by dogs. That ranks higher than rape. Eh, it just does. But I guess Tandsy was another extra? So we... don't give a shit?


I have a hard time phrasing any of this in a way that doesn't suggest I'm impartial to what happened. I'm not, obviously.

But this was, as frankly, as I can put it, much milder than I had been fearing. I had a pit in my stomach for weeks. I was positive that the ""worst scene in the history of Game of Thrones"" was going to include dogs, Miranda, and gore. I kept watching, but was honestly afraid of what I was going to see.

Compared to hearing bones crunch as someone is eaten alive by dogs, or Craster's whole fucking house of rape, this was... par for the course in the shit world of Westeros.

As someone who purely watches the television show, I feel like maybe I should care about Sansa more than I do.  From my perspective as a watcher of the show, she has **certainly** had her fair share of horror... but she also seems to have similar motivations to that of Cersei and Margaery.  It seems like there has been at least a dozen points in this show where Sansa is presented with options.  From my perspective, she's had options to leave on multiple occasions.  It seems once a week someone is reminding her that she has options... whether it's The Hound or Brienne or Littlefinger himself... and yet she stays in this situation.  At some point, it starts to feel like she's a willing participant.  From the beginning of the show they have presented her as a naive girl who dreamed of living in a beautiful castle as a powerful princess/queen (not unlike Cersei and Margaery).  She doesn't really seem to sway from that goal.   I have a feeling she comes across differently in the books.  My impression of her impacted how I interpreted that final scene.  Yes, it was terrible in context with what we know about Ramsey Bolton.  If I was supposed to react by saying ""Oh poor Sansa!"" I feel like the showrunners have failed me... because in the show they are presenting her as partially responsible for making that bed.  In this world that GRR Martin has created, sleeping with deplorable men goes with the territory for women who play the game of thrones.  It did somewhat mirrored the early Season 1 scene of Daenerys and Khal Drogo... but in that scene, Daenerys was seemingly entirely powerless and forced into that situation without any options.  In this instance, Sansa seems to be much more of a willing participant in the series of events that lead her there.     I can't be the only one who interprets the show this way.   A friend of mine joked that Sansa is such a bystander to her family's downfall that Arya might as well have Sansa's name on her hit list.

But I noticed something which I haven't seen anybody else mention which I think is worthy of discussion. I think there is a double meaning to this episode title. Also note that this is from the purely speculative perspective of a non-spoiled non-book reader.

I think that ""Unbent, unbowed, and unbroken"" is actually referring to Theon. Yes, I know that some will say he displayed inaction and maybe even submission at the end, but bear with me. There were many moments during this episode that reinforced the notion that Theon is still Theon and not just some dead husk named ""Reek"". (Such as the wedding scene, his conversation with Sansa earlier, and his face in the final scene). 

During that final scene, I wanted him to act and almost expected him to due to the title of the episode. Since he didn't, I'm going to say that I think the title of this episode is actually foreshadowing Ramsay's demise at the hands of Theon.

If anything, his facial expression alone showed that he is far from ""Unbroken"". ""Reek"" would've just looked on with that distant and detached stare, while Theon would've been infuriated. I think we know which response we witnessed.

So what do you guys think? Was this intentional? Is it foreshadowing? Or am I drawing too long a bow on this one?",2,8,False,self,,,,,

If Stannis wins, Littlefinger uses his army to kill the already destroyed army of Stannis and kills Stannis and thus gets rid of almost all the kings. If the Boltons win, he kills the Boltons. He hopes that Sansa is already dead or kills her (this is necessary for the next step, if she isn't dead, he arranges for her death). He then makes an excuse and tells Cersie that he is busy taking out the Grayjoys. 

He enlists the Frays to his cause by marrying a Fray Daughter. Thus he has the entire world under his control (except for the Lannisters and the Tyrals). He lets them fight it out and tells Cersie that he is too busy fighting the Grayjoys, so can't make it down there to save her. the Tyralls win and kill all the Lannister's in the city. During this time, LittleFinger uses his superior numbers to decimate all the Grayjoys so they never 'rebel' again. He also moves against the Lannister home in Casterly Rock (pretty much just do what Robb was going to do). LittleFinger finally comes down to the throne with an army composed of the North, the Frays, the Vale armies.

Daenerys doesn't care about Westeross anymore and she wants to unite all the free cities and rebuild something similar to the old Velarian empire. so Daenerys rules the land of Essos and Littlefinger rules the land of Westeross.

I want to discuss Tommen Baratheon here since i havent really seen a post about him even though he plays a pretty important character at the moment.

I would like you guys to touch on his weaknesses because even though he does seem like a very kind and good king, he seems to be very powerless. The reason i am opening this thread is because i am very mad, a king should not, at any cost let his Queen be arrested by these fanatics.

In episode 4, Loras was arrested and Tommen went to talk to the High Septon (Sparrow) and the fanatics stopped Tommen and his guards entering. Now i remember exactly what the king's guard said. 
&gt; Give the order, and we'll clear out this rebel.

I understand why Tommen didnt want a massacre, he is a kind character. But in the latest episode, they charged his wife, his Queen and took her away infront of his eyes and he did have guards in the room with him, so why didnt the guards react? Why didnt Tommen react? 

So far i am really dissapointed, i was expecting more from the ruler of the seven kingdoms. Isn't he supposed to be one of the most powerful people in GoT? I understand that he is very much under the influence of Cersei but im really hoping to see him do something to stop that cult, how is a king supposed to defend his kingdom if he cant control his own city?

They are just as much fanatics but they seem to get a pass. Why? Because they are cool it seems. They change faces, sure, pretty cool. They also support killing little kids and recruiting children an brainwashing them into their cult. 

So, why do people lash out at the Sparrows yet seem to give TFM such a pass? Does any one seriously not see them both as cultist fanatics? 

Sparrows: ""Worship The Seven"" - have soup kitchens to curry favor with the masses but lash out at alcohol, gay sex and religious hypocrisy among the elite, promotes ""we're all the same to them"" mentality. 

The Faceless Men: worship ""The Many Faced god"" - Perfectly fine with using brainwashing techniques on children, teaching them to lie, kill, even going so far as to give them increased status as a reward for tricking children through lies into killing themselves. Encourages deception as a rule.   


I genuinely don't see why TFM get such a pass on this sub other than people agree with them. If that's true it's pretty creepy.

It seems symptomatic of something I've noticed in the show more and more... [warning, long]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/36cs4h/s5e6all_spoilers_between_the_sand_snakes/,[deleted],1431944433,"Most of the changes so far this season, and most changes in general throughout the show, have one common denominator to them; there is less work. 

Lady Stoneheart, The Greyjoys etc... I don't think they were removed because the writers are going in a new direction, but because they seem pretty happy with where the show is and don't intend to move it in a new direction but instead follow through on the characters that they have.

The proof was in this episode for me.

Sansa has been a victim for 4.5 seasons now, I think about 70% of her screen time is sulking but when the writers have the opportunity to have her have more depth than being tooled around by psychopaths instead we have a rape - not a moment where she turns the tables on one of the most cruel people in fictional history but instead the writers thought it would be such a fucking blindside to have a rape scene instead. 

Why? Was it because she needed yet another thing to make her work against her captors in more than snarky remarks occasionally? Was it because the writers want to show that a victim of rape can be a strong person? Maybe? I'd actually really like to see that but what I expect will happen is Sansa will continue being the whipping girl because its edgy as fuck. 

Now why does THIS particular rape bother me so much more than the others? 

Because it is COMPLETELY counter intuitive to everything happening in the past 2 seasons. Do you remember [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csxai6vEoyg) Sansa? The one that took control of events happening her and turned them in her favor and doing something proactive? Seeming like she learned something from the political torture of kings landing, maybe even more cunning than the child in the beginning of the show? Hell, even in the minutes prior we had a Sansa that told Ramsay's girlfriend Miranda ""You can't frighten me."" which made it seem like she was that strong independent woman that we, the audience and they the show have been leading up to. 

In the end it felt like a rug was pulled from beneath my feet. Watching the last five minutes I didn't feel like I was watching the same character I saw in the end of Season Four. I felt nothing but cheated, as the writers thought ""Oh man they'll never expect this to happen to her!"". Well they were right, but it wasn't because they subverted expectations with red herrings and foreshadowing but instead they pull it out of their asses. Will the writers try to show that victims of rape (and trauma in general) can move on and grow from their trauma to be complete, independent and strong people? I hope so, but I doubt it... 

This TV Sansa will likely light a candle and be rescued by who the fuck ever to be pawned about by who the fuck ever else and continue to mope for another season and frankly that's not something I'm interested in watching. I'd rather they just kill her off and be done with it. 

Sansa isn't the only thing that bothered me in this episode, Jaime Lannister was by far one of the most interesting and deep characters on the show/books and now he has been reduced to a [buddy cop show](https://i.imgur.com/505fWpb.jpg) with Bron. 

And while some people love it, that's fine, but its just not why I, or many others, watch the show. If I wanted to watch a buddy cop movie I'd watch something else, but if I want to watch interesting characters develop over years with more depth than a birdbath I watch Game of Thrones. 

Whoever wrote the dialogue for the Sand Snakes should be fired. 

Whoever wrote the dialogue for the scenes between Lannister Girl and Dorne Boy should be fired. 

This season had one of the LEAST impactful trials I've ever seen, I was SO bored watching it when I shouldn't have been. Maybe I'm still coming down from the high that was Tyrions trial but damn this show seems like its fallen a lot lately.  

This show seems like its turning simply into more of the same, and the Sand Snakes dialogue and overall story, the cliche as fuck moments between the Jamie's daughter and The Dornish prince, the removal of Lady Stoneheart, the removal of Asha Greyjoy, Donkey Girl etc... 


This show is different from the books but only in a way that boils it down to simplicity, for the writers, for the watchers and to the detriment of the story.

We have no idea if he was honest to Cerisi but we can make guesses on what he wants.

1. The one thing I think we know he wanted as he said it to a dying women and he has said it for a long time that he wanted to be married to Catelyn Stark she is of course dead. So we can only guess what he wants besides that.

2. He told Sansa he wanted everything. This could mean a lot of things. If he was being honest my guess is everything means sitting on the Iron Throne. While he is clever enough to do it I don't see how he could have the bloodline to do it. That being said neither did Aegon but he had dragons so...

3. Is Warden of the North enough. To most men yes but to him no? Once again though the easiest way is to take out the Boltons/Stannis after he invades Winterfell. If he does that I guess he can either kill Sansa and get Warden from Cersei or say Sansa escaped and hope to get it anyway. If he does that though Sansa will have to be in hiding since if everyone knows that Sansa is alive Cersei will for sure hear about it. Also a non Stark and non North house being Warden is risky. The North will Remember. Which goes to my next question...

4. Does he want to be with Sansa? I think A LOT of people are taking this for granted. Including myself I thought for sure he would want to be with Catelyn's daughter until this episode. He left Sansa in Winterfell so that he could make this plan knowing the risk of putting her there. Also she is the daughter of Ned Stark a man he hated(?). I am not saying he doesn't like her for sure but I we can never be sure. I am not sure how this plan works without Sansa's death. Cersei maybe will grant him Warden of the North without killing Sansa if she is smart because Petyr should marry a Stark to get Winterfell and I am sure Tywin would agree with that plan if he was alive. Anyway Warden of the North with Sansa as his Wife is pretty good for someone so low born as Petyr but for some reason I think it might not be enough.

5. King in the North takes over the 7 Kingdoms? This is the biggest stretch but if Stannis wins he then beats Stannis now there is a North who hates the Freys and the Lannisters he then decides to take over Westeros. The Army of the North and the Vale is no where near big enough to do it without dragons but it the simplest way for him to take the 7 Kingdoms and stay with Sansa.

Anyway what do you think he wants do you think is goal is? Is warden of the North enough or will he try to get to be King? If so how?

Everyone is grossed out and upset and miserable because a human being was abused in a horrible ,manner that violated her in every way. Her body was violated. Her mind was violated. She was abused. It's terrible. Everyone is unanimous, tonight, in their hate for the rapist, Ramsay Bolton. What a villain! How could he do something like this to Sansa?
Three years ago, when Theon Greyjoy was tortured brutally in many awful ways. He was violated in every way. His body was violated. His mind was violated. He was abused. It was terrible. No one was outraged then. No one seemed to care. At the height of his abuse in Season 3, people were more busy making offensive memes and laughing at torture, unthinkably base and disgusting than protesting his treatment. The media did not cry out. The great majority people did not accuse HBO of ""going too far.
In my mind this is unacceptable. Both Theon Greyjoy and Sansa Stark were equally violated and abused by Ramsay Bolton. It is hypocrisy that one character should be showered with pity and protest, while the other character's suffering should be justified under the fact that ""he deserved it."" 
No one deserves torture.
No one deserves rape.
No one deserves Ramsay Bolton.
Most of all, no one deserves the fickle minds of audiences across the world. Where was your outcry for Theon Greyjoy when he needed you? Oh, but I forget. The world was laughing.",66,27,False,self,,,,,

People on this sub and r/asoiaf like to complain that D&amp;D's writing makes no sense and that they don't know what they're doing, but I beg to differ. They know how the story's going to end, they probably even know the whole series better than most of the complainers. Just because a plot thread comes up that doesn't make any sense doesn't mean a later episode won't address it. Think of how Quaithe warned Jorah about going to Valyria in S2. Probably left a few of us scratching our heads, and then last week we find she foretold he would get grayscale. D&amp;D know what they're doing. Something happen that doesn't make sense to you?

Perhaps it would be a good idea to make a list of these loose ends for future reference.

1) Bran, Hodor and Meera: So they've gotten to the weirwood tree along with a Child of the Forest. I'm actually concerned at this point that we won't see them again until season 6, which is disappointing because I only just started caring about Bran again.

2) Osha &amp; Rickon : At the end of Season 3 they decided to split off from Bran to go to Last Hearth. We have heard nothing about them since. If Roose Bolton had a firm grip on the North, wouldn't he know about them by now? Or better yet, Stannis plans to hold the north, wouldn't Last Hearth want to make some sort of deal to install Rickon if that was the case?
That is all assuming Rickon and Osha even reached Last Hearth safe and sound. But we don't know that because its been nearly 2 seasons since we've last seen them.

3) Yara &amp; the Iron Islands: Mel put some leeches on a barbeque to kill Salty King Balon, but the last we saw he was looking into a box with Theon's dangly bits. Yara meanwhile circumnavigated Westeros in season 4 just to raid the Dreadfort with about 10 other guys. This is my most glaring absence because while Cersei et all are still casually stating the war is over, Balon has crowned himself and nobody has done anything. I just wanna pimpslap Cersei and remind her that the Iron Islands are reaving and raping up and down the coastline, and your ancestral seat is in the firing line.

4) The Freys: Fuck these guys. There's so many of them, and yet the only one we've seen is Fat Walda. The Rat Chef was foreshadowed for a reason, and that means we still need to see Walder Frey to get his comeuppance.

5)Brotherhood without Banners: A squad of knights and monks and bards? They are another group that have been absent since Season 3. I get that they may not fit the general theme of the show, but Thoros and Beric seem important. Beric must have been if Thoros was able to resurrect him not once, but 7 times! That's some Voldemort level of immortality. 

6) The Tullys: Edmure is the last survivor of a great house, and yet we've heard little of him since? Did he die? I honestly don't know. And then there's the Blackfish. He went to take a piss a few minutes before the Red Wedding. Unless they explicitly mention him again, I'm gonna have to assume he died.

7) Gendry: Just keep rowing, I'm sure you'll cross a plot thread at some point.

Honorably mentions: -Robin Arryn, this is probably premature for me to say is a ""loose end"" but definitely still a part to play.
-Varys, who is stranded in Essos without Tyrion. Is he just gonna find his own way to Meereen or go home?
-Illyrio Mopatis, who hasn't been onscreen since Season 1, BUT Tyrion spent episode 1 in Pentos in his mansion with Varys. They wouldn't do that without a reason.

By the way, this isn't intended as a criticism of the show or anything. Its just that there are a LOT of characters we have to deal with here, and it would be quite embarrassing for the show to end and we all collectively ask what happened to, say, Yara or Bran.",93,192,False,self,,,,,

Her conversation with Myranda made me sure that final scene was going to unfold differently. But instead Sansa crumpled- all her 'training' from Littlefinger, Cersei, etc. seemed to have gone to waste. Now, based on those promos for next week, it seems like she's just going to flee the Boltons, basically rendering this whole venture sort of pointless except for adding just another trauma to Sansa's already sizeable list.

I am *not* referring to the people who are upset with the actual show making this change and want to stop watching the show.

I've seen at least half a dozen threads already on how it ""wasn't that bad"" and that ""it could be worse"". And even more comments about how people can't understand why this scene bothered people so much. And a lot of comments trying to invalidate those feelings (rape hysteria, really?) and then list examples of more horrible things done in the show. As if that invalidates why people were horrified by this particular scene. 

This scene wasn't actually visually graphic. That's not why it turned my stomach. This show has definitely desensitized a lot of us to the dark reality of this show. We've seen people beheaded on screen. People brutally murdered, other women raped, Theon castrated, Oberyn's head crushed, pregnant Talisa stabbed in the stomach, etc. Well, why did this particular scene get to us? Personally, it made my stomach turn. 

It's because it happened to Sansa. It's because of how emotionally invested we are in her character. For five years/seasons, we've followed the story of an innocent young girl, who grew up at Winterfell, daydreaming of gallant knights and romance. Her concerns were of dresses, sewing, and lemoncakes.And to be married off to a handsome and gentle man and become a doting wife. She was naive and blind to how horrible Joffrey was in the beginning because acknowledging the truth would've destroyed her vision. *And we saw this side of her*. They showed this side of her early in the show. And we all watched how her life transformed after several horrible things happened to her. 

She grew up fast and became a player of the game, in order to survive. We're rooting for her. Then she gets married off to the most sadistic man we've seen in the show.

---

**""It's fiction.""**

Yes, it is. Are people not suppose to become emotionally invested in books, movies, shows, etc? We aren't robots. We are aware these are not real people. Are we not allowed to feel something toward these fake characters when something bad happens to them? If not, then there is no point in even watching shows/movies. 

**""It's not the worst thing to happen in the show.""**

People keep bringing up Talisa being stabbed in the stomach when she is pregnant. Because of how shocking and horrible this scene was, we're not allowed to feel a certain way about this scene. For the Red Wedding, most of us weren't  very emotionally invested in Talisa's character and her faceless unborn child. We didn't feel a ""personal"" connection to her that we do to Sansa. Also the Red Wedding, which was a result of Robb's betrayal. And Theon being castrated and how Ramsay dehumanized and broke him. In the eyes of the audience, he ""deserved this"" (I'm NOT saying this is right, but this is the reasoning behind it) because one can argue that Sansa is in this position directly because of Theon's actions. And Dany's own rape/wedding night. And countless other examples.


I didn't know it was supposed to be a pissing contest about who had it worse and that's supposed to dictate where this scene lands on the scale of horrible things in the show. These are all awful things we've seen. Some people are so desensitized and this scene just made them shrug and say ""whelp, she *could* have it worse!"" True, she could be dead. She could've been flayed. 

Thank the merciful gods only married her off to a man so fucked up, that we sorta wish Joffrey was alive. Yes, there were many other scenes a lot more brutal than this one. And it was worse in the books. Still doesn't change how it made me feel. Not sure how comparing it the what happened in the books was supposed to make me feel better about what happened.

**It's Ramsay, we expected this. We saw it coming.""**

Okay? Not sure why that's supposed to make us feel better about what happened. We expected a lot of things to happen in the show and they were still emotionally devastating when they happened.

---

Honestly, I made this thread after seeing a lot of pretty gross comments about it. People trying to justify why it's not that bad because ""the books are worse"". How sensitive people are being. Oh, and my favorite - ""Tonight 1000 white knights scream out in agony."" Because only white knights and overly sensitive people could have felt a twinge of emotional stirring after that scene.

In short, we've grown to root for this once naive girl. Then she is brutally raped and dehumanized on her wedding night in her own home by a fucking psychopath, while making her once 'foster brother' watch. Just because we didn't see it directly on screen, does not lessen the impact it had on people. If anything, I felt the scene was even more worse and impactful because I didn't have to see what happened to for it to still turn my stomach.

This world and many aspects of it reflect the harsh reality and rape hits close to home for a lot of us fans, on a personal level. I guess I'm just baffled by people trying to downplay it and list bad excuses as to why *it wasn't that bad*. 

Sorry for the rambling, I figured if people can make half a dozen threads and write paragraphs about why it could be worse and how tame it was, I figured I can throw in some reasoning why it sickened the rest of us.

edit: I am not one of the people who were offended by the actual scene and the decision to put it in the show. I was sickened by what happened in the scene and who it happened to, not the choice of putting it on the show. ",32,29,False,self,,,,,

1. Sansa is still legally married to Tyrion. Even after everything that happened last season, the marriage is still valid, and can only ends when one of the two dies or joins some order that prevents marriage (Nightswatch, joins the faith as a nun, etc..)

2. Littlefinger is taking a massive risk in leaving Sansa in the North. People are very much aware of how much of a monster Ramsay is and the things he has done. Did he really expect nothing would happen to her if he asked nicely?

3. How can Littlefinger ever hide his involvement in this whole plan? So many people now know that Sansa was in the Vale. There are so many ways it can get out that Petyr is behind all this.

First off, I hope Bronn doesn't die. Not only because I like his character, but that would be a crappy way to kill of his character. Some people may relate this to Barristan Selmy, but I relate to it more with Thane and Kai Leng in ME3. Thane, a bad ass assassin, gets killed by some stupid ninja who barely has any motive + tries to hard to seem threatening/intimidating. Same thing happened in this episode, Bronn gets cut by some characters who try too hard to seem dangerous + intimidating. They went from ""will it be war?"" to ""lets go kill her right away in the middle of the day"". Felt rushed with barely any exposition.

Also poison would be a stupid way to kill him from a cut. Considering we had a guy get sliced and stabbed in the gut with a spear drenched in poison, and he lived.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

I sort of knew it was coming (and, horrifically, did anyone else think during that scene 'oh he's just raping her'? because what happened to the book counterpart was so much worse). It's more that I'm sick of *and then she got RAPED and it was TERRIBLE* being the absolute worst thing to threaten a female character with on this show, like their female characters are walking vaginal defense systems and that's the worst thing that could happen. I'm not saying rape isn't awful, don't get me wrong, I'm just sick of it being the Sword of Damocles hanging over every woman's head. Which, I mean, I get the time period and the setting and it's not a kind place to anyone, but rape is not the only way to make a woman suffer. So here's a list of different ways HBO could make their female characters miserable without having to rape them. 


* Public decapitation
* Chased by white walkers
* Somehow killing a white walker but no one believes them
* Molten golden crown poured over their head
* Gored by a boar
* Die of infection
* Get baked into a pie
* Accidentally eat a pie with relatives baked in
* Get poisoned as part of a secret plot to start a war
* Attacked by a shadow baby
* Dismemberment. I mean, think about it. You've got four main limbs to choose from. The possibilities are ~~endless~~ four.
* Could get killed and burned up and passed off as a noble lord or lady to start a war.
* Flaying.
* Locked in a tower and starved until she eats her own fingers out of desperation.

I mean, I'm sure you guys at HBO could think of more! See, *and then she got RAPED* is not the worst thing that can happen to your female characters. There's so much other shit you can put them through. And, to be honest, every time we see a rape scene, it packs a little less of a punch than the one before it. Lay off it for a while and do something else to the ladies. In this world there is plenty to choose from. (Or rape one of the guys for once, I don't know.)",12,0,False,default,,,,,

Obviously the only way I could know that is sex, because as a squire there's no situation I would ever see his thigh. Especially since squires sometimes BATHE THEIR MASTERS. Also, don't check or anything, because that would be stupid.""

What POSSIBLE motivation could that squire have for outing Loras? Literally the minute you say, ""I know he's gay because I fucked him"" you're gonna get executed too. Does he get a pardon for doing that? Even if he did, how the fuck does that benefit him? If you're fucking Loras, you have a smoking hot knight who can kill literally anyone in Westeros, who can give you literally anything you want. I cannot see a single motivation for his character.

God damn it, there was some intense shit in this episode, but 50% of it came out of nowhere.

edit: Someone mentioned Littlefinger, which is interesting. Olyvar has repeatedly been the one to say, ""This is Lord Baelish's establishment"". So, he repeatedly has been the enemy of the Faith Militant. I can't think of any reason he would help them (especially by admitting something that WILL get him killed) other than a direct order from Littlefinger. The first person Littlefinger talks to in King's Landing is Lancel Lannister, meaning he immediately knew about Loras. I will be SO happy if this is true, as it makes one particularly stupid scene incredibly brilliant. 

That brings up a second question. Why is Littlefinger the only person who seems to be able to play the GoT? Is everyone else just...stupid? Can absolutely no one outwit him?",309,494,False,self,,,,,

Further, the only proof that the Squire can offer to corroborate his claims is that he knows Loras has a birthmark on his upper thigh, and omg how could he know this if he hadn't been sleeping with him?

Hold up; isn't the role of a squire, among other things, to dress and arm a knight for battle? Wouldn't the regular duties of a squire require them to see their master in different manners of undress?  The whole basis that he could only know about the birthmark through hooking up with Loras is flawed by his role as his squire.  

This is like saying that Tom Brady must be gay because someone on the Patriot's locker room staff claims to have banged him and knows he has a weird mole on his butt.  Tom Brady may very well have a weird mole on his butt but that doesn't mean this guy has hooked up with him just because this guy might've seen him changing.

Through out the series Sansa has been a victim, but over the last 2 seasons we see her come out as ""Survivor"", who thinks clearly and plans ahead. Putting her back into the victim role just seams like bad writing. Her beating Ramsey at his own game on the other hand seams extremely fitting.

It seems really fitting, he'll help Sansa escape or something, they'll build up his character a bit, get everyone on his side, he's even let out a smile at Sansa.

So in the climax of it all he has an encounter with Ramsay, it'll just be those 2 (and maybe Sansa), there'll be a fight between the two, and I think Reek will really be the under dog, he's going to take a fucking beating, he's no match for Ramsay's strength, not to mention the fact that Ramsay scares the shit out of him. Anyway, we figured it would all end in them falling off a tower, or each being stabbed, the point being each of then dies, Reek has gone on a huge redemption arc, and Sansa forgives him for killing her brothers, or calls him by his name, and Reek gets to be Theon in his dying moments, knowing he saved a princess, there might be a song about him made at Sansas request.

What a fitting end for Theons tale, yes?

* **Sansa Stark has been one of my favorite character's for years**, the **""How long do i have too look?""** line and her **""Maybe He'll give me yours.""** comeback to Joffrey she gives in episode 10 are some of my most favorite lines.

* **Last nights ending was HORRIBLE!!!**

***However***

it was in no way either:

a) Destruction of Sansa's character arc, or

b) Shock value entertainment.

I think this to be enrichment of Sansa's story, in a horrible sort of way, now Sansa has lost every physical trace to her childhood: Family, Friends, clothes, tully hair colour, her name, even her maidenhead. There is only one thing Sansa knows she has left from her childhood... **THEON.**

Theon is Sansa's ""Needle"", her weapon. i think the emotion shown by Alfie Allen clearly states her remembers who he is, not who he is forced to be (**reek**) or who he pretended to be (**Theon Greyjoy, heir to the Sea-stone chair**) but who he has been since the age of 10 **Theon Greyjoy, Ward to House Stark**

My prediction is that Sansa will use Theon, in some way, to kill Miranda or even Ramsay, much as Arya plans to use Needle. Then Sansa will betray theon, after all she was trained by LF and Theon did ""kill"" her two brothers and cause north to march north back over the twins.

as for shock factor, did people really suspect that Boltons Bastard, a man famous for flaying Men, Woman and Children, Hunting Humans for sport and torturing wouldn't try and ""**claim his rights**""? NOT 1 WEEK AGO did we find out the manner is which he was conceived, where you not paying attention?

Now as for **the hypocrisy**: i don't know if its just be who has observed this but **most , not all,** of the fans, especially girl fans, who have went on a tirade against D+D, HBO and even GRRM... are mostly Daenerys fans?... 

Daenerys, like Sansa, was used as a bargaining chip. Dany was traded to gain dothraki power, Sansa to gain stark loyalists. **Danny was Raped** and is now the most vital female character in the show. the same goes for Cersei she tells us ""Robert drunkenly claimed his rights"" after their wedding.

***TL;DR Sansa ordeal got worse in order to progress her role as now a stark and ""Bolton"", she will become the most important female character is westeros. and people should realise this before jumping on the shock factor bandwagon***",37,7,False,self,,,,,

Regardless of whose fault it was, if I was directing it and saw the final cut of that fight, I would've scrapped it.  

If you have actresses that can't convincingly twirl a spear or swing a dagger even after weeks of training, then you have a quick fight.  The SS are supposed to be badass fighters - why not have them simply surprise Jamie and Bronn (like they did with the whip grab), quickly disarm them, and have them at their mercy, when Aero stops them?  Take the scene down to 30 seconds.  Why have a drawn out fight w/ people that simply can't convincingly fight??

The deviations from the novels and the exclusion of certain seemingly major storylines and characters. How I would have solved this as follows. 

The Meereen plotline so far for me has fallen the most flat (maybe dorne but that is just execution). Basically we've seen some character development and subtle positioning for when Tyrion arrives in meereen. Dany makes a few mistakes early, which shows she's not ready for prime time and then in the 4th episode we see her finally make the obvious smart decision to open the fighting pits (duh). I think all of her scenes with the sons of the harpy and whatnot could have been entirely cut without losing anything. Instead, in my version we wouldn't see Dany until Tyrion arrives in Meereen, presumably with Jorah, I'm guessing in episode 6 or 7.

Instead of Dany's Meereen screentime I would really have liked to see the following.

1. Ep. 1: Balon plotting revenge on the Bolton's for Theon - dies at the end of the episode. Kingsmoot announced by Aeron.
2. Ep. 2: No ironborn
3. Ep. 3: Kingsmoot, introduction of Victarian and Euron. Euron wins.
4. Ep. 4. No ironborn
5. Ep. 5 Euron dispatches Victarian to find Dany/asha lauches attacks in the north
6. Ep. 6: No ironborn
7. Ep. 7: Victarian at sea/asha getting captured by stannis on the way to winterfell
8. Ep. 8: No ironborn
9. Ep. 9: Victarian arrives in Slavers Bay/asha reunited with Theon after escaping w/ Sansa
10. Ep. 10: Maybe no ironborn? Depends on how they handle the finale


If gets us roughly to the same place essentially but at least sets up whatever end game the Ironborn have in store for them in season 6/7 - that is unless GRRM has already told the showrunners that they are irrelevant and can be cut. Still, its an interesting subplot for me that connects to at least two or three main threads (theon/stannis, dany/tyrion) that would have jazzed up this season which is feeling a little stale. Instead of showing it, we could have learned a bit about what Dany is up to through exposition in the Tyrion/Varys scenes on the road to meereen, the victarian/euron scenes and then maybe a bit more from the slavers who capture tyrion and Jorah. This frees up plenty of room for the ironborn storyline. There are other ways to cut a few scenes here and there to free up space for the ironborn if you need to. 

* One too many Brienne and Pod scenes (though I like these the inn scene w/ littlefinger was a bit forced imo)
* Likewise with the Winterfell stuff. Miranda as a character is a bit pointless so far. 
* The Dornish stuff is just plain bad. I understand having to get Jaime out of kings landing and introduce the dornish but this should either have been handled better or given less emphasis. Is it possible that the dornish characters have more impact on end game than the ironborn?
* Whatever Jon is getting into with the wildlings seems like it will be superfluous

I understand why HBO wouldn't or couldn't do this (too many characters to follow, can't have that many actors attached, good portion of fans love dany who is one of three or four main leads, also keeping the dragons relevant, maybe ironborn are irrelevant) but I think bringing Dany into the show mid-season would have made a lot of sense since she hasn't done anything at all really so far. 

Anyway, feel free to disagree. Just my two cents.

How was he created? I watched how he was created, but is there an explanations I missed that was on the show (and not the books), on how an individual can be brainwashed to become another person (Reek), yet still retains his old self (Theon)?

I mean, when a) Yara went to saved him, he refused to go with her, and b) he frozenly watched what happened to Sansa. That to me looks like Reek has lost his old identity (Theon) and now he becomes another person (Reek).

However, when Ramsay told him to apologize to Sansa, he said sorry and he acted very guilty.

So what kind of explanation was given on the TV Show on Ramsay's mindfuckery to Reek?
Seems inconsistent to me that he's at once Reek and Theon. If Theon is still Theon, why the F does Reek not just a) ran away or b) killed Ramsay any chance he get?
Ramsay seems very careless around Reek anyway.

First the wall.  Obviously at the end of the season John Snow will be ""killed"" by Olly, who's only purpose in the show is to kill Jon.  All very dramatic and a fun way for HBO to end that story line.  Yay.

Now, as we go south things become more interesting but probably not to interesting this season.  As of right now Bolton holds the North but that cannot last long with both Stannis and Petyr Baelish coming for it.  The real wild card here is Petyr, will he align with Cersie, Bolton, Stannis or himself?  I have my money on us not seeing any of that happening this season.  The season will end with Stannis taking Winterfell and the show will go from there.

In Kings Landing nothing will really change.  Cersie will annoyingly continue to be in power with a shaky but intact alliance with the Martells.

Dorne, will continue to be annoyingly petty with nothing really happening. (Maybe we'll get to see Myrcella's ear chopped off?)

Now, to the other side of the sea.  I believe that Tyrion and Jorah never make it to Daenerys but of course continue to live.  Mormont will continue being every character.  His final seen will probably be him deciding to fight for Daenerys in Westeros like that one Targaryan who is Jorah.  Danny herself will be betrayed by Hizdahr zo Loraq and Darrio Naharris/House Greyjoy, only to be saved by Drogon.  Danny's story will end with her being carried off into the grasslands on Drogo's back.

Not as brutal as some other scenes with the same theme, but it angered and touched us because of who we know Sansa was, all she has been through, and who we are hoping she becomes. That said, I think that Sansa knew what was coming, not that it would be soooo bad, but having sex with Ramsey was going to be baaaaad no matter what. I don't think she thought she would be seduced and enjoy it. Even if the act was not really bad, having sex with a Bolton, the family that arranged the murder of your family, would not be something to look forward to. 

I think she was prepared for the inevitable in her quest to bring the Boltons down. It was something she knew she would have to endure to play the long game.

 She knew she would be having sex with Ramsey during this plan to infiltrate the family, gain their trust and ultimately be in a position to hopefully be key to their destruction. 

Also, this scene brought up so much hatred in the viewers, so we can only imagine the hatred that Sansa in channeling to make her stronger in her determination to seek her vengeance. I'm quite looking forward to what Sansa does to Ramsey when the opportunity arises. It will be soooo much more brutal than last night, and I won't turn my head for a second.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

So, theres quite a few people who were appalled and nauseated over the wedding night scene in Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. Theres also quite a few people who are wondering what those folks are so freaked out about.

Im going to try and parse out a few different reasons why people had such a visceral reaction to that scene, especially relating to other similar scenes in the show. Talking points include:

1. Sansa and Ramsay v. Dany and Drogo (focusing specifically on parallels, audience-character relationships, and framing)
2. Theons character arc (especially peoples reaction, or non-reaction)

So! Lets dig in.

**I. Sansa, Danaerys, and the Audience**

The big argument I hear on the *why is everyone so horrified* end is This shit happened in the first few episodes of the show and there wasnt nearly as big a shitstorm. Its an understandable argument, there are a lot of parallels between Danaeryss wedding night and Sansas. Both Dany and Sansa are two nervous young women who have been essentially sold to more powerful men for political gain by male family figures who creep on them (Dany's brother Viserys, Sansa's ""uncle"" Petyr). Why should we be super uncomfortable about one and just kinda shrug at the other?

One reason is how well we, the audience, know these characters at the time of the scenes in question. We barely know anything about Danaerys when she is sold off to Drogo, other than shes an exiled princess with a skeevy brother. Shes the chick you met a couple of times in a coffee shop and hear a few days later that she was raped by her boyfriend. You feel awful and are sad to hear about it, but it doesnt really impact you in a major way.

With Sansa on the other hand, we the audience have known her for several years now. Weve watched her grow from nave and bratty young girl to a traumatized young woman fending for her lifeand lately, into a manipulator who is just starting to come into her own and explore what power she has, meager though it might be. We saw her grow a backbone, especially in this past episode right before the rape.  Shes the chick you share a work shift with on a regular basis, who you talk to fairly often, who tells you about the never-ending parade of abuse she goes through on a day to day basis. When she escapes one abusive boyfriend and starts learning to stand up for herself, you feel happy for her and congratulate her. Then you hear that shes been forced into a relationship with someone as bad as, if not worse, than her old beauand that he raped her in her own home and forced a childhood friend to watch. 

We hadnt spent enough time with Danys character to get a real deep sense of empathy going, other than the basic Thats terrible! instinctive empathy that most people possess. With Sansa, its a deep creeping horror that this person who you know very well is going through this horrible ordeal *right in front of you, holy shit* as you are utterly powerless to do anything to stop it. 

(The powerlessness thing also comes into play narratively. You, the audience, know throughout all of her scenes in Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken what is going to happen, and that nothing you do can change the outcome. The slow build-up of dread can totally contribute to the gut reaction a lot of people are having towards the scene.)

Another factor as to why people are more aghast at Sansas rape than Danys could be the way that the scene is framed. As I stated above, there are a lot of parallels between the scenes, but there is one huge differencethe attitude of the husband. 

Drogo seems mostly business oriented. He isn't deliberately trying to hurt Danaerys, it's just their wedding night and he has to consumate the marraige because that's what you do. In his eyes, all he's doing is putting the final signature to a contract. Ramsay, on the other hand, has just gotten himself a new toy and is relishing it, very deliberately getting off on the power that he holds over his new wife. He wants to see how far he can push before he breaks her, and both everyone in the room and the audience know this is only the first step. It's a similar scene, but framed very differently.

One of the facts that is generally known about rape is that it in most cases it isnt about pure sexual satisfaction, but the power trip that the agressor gets by violating the victim in such an extremely intimate way. Drogo doesnt really seem to consider any of thathes just doing his husband-ly duty as he sees themif they dont have consumate the union, then they arent actually married yet. In all liklihood, he probably interprets Danys crying as nerves, since its her first time. He doesnt revel in the power imbalance, doesnt even really seem aware of it (other that I am Husband, she is Wife, therefore I am in charge). 

Ramsay, on the other hand, is obviously getting off on the fact that Sansa is alone, afraid, defenseless, and completely in his power. Its one thing to be told that most rapes are about power, and another to be shown through a well shot, well acted scene *exactly* how it is about power. Rape is sort of taboo in our media (along with a lot of other hang-ups about sex in general, but thats neither here nor there), and people dont really see such stark portrayals of the act very often. You can be aware of the horrors of rape on an intellectual level, but not on a real Holy shit, thats horrifying level. This scene might have driven home to quite a few people what they only concieved of as a word, as oppossed to a reality.

The cut away from the rape itself may have lessened the impact for some people, but for others it likely made it worse. When Theon looks terrified and horrified, your mind supplies what would cause you to look like that. The things your own  mind can come up with can be waaaay scarier than anything a director might show because your mind knows what terrifies it the most (which is what makes horror movies where you rarely see the monster so effective). 

**II. Theon**

Another argument Ive seen pop up a lot is Why are people so appalled by what happens to Sansa when what has happened to Theon (i.e. completely breaking and remaking him, torture that extended over months, complete loss of sex organ, etc.) was arguably worse[and we laughed and high-fived](http://i.imgur.com/4f0EIIl.gif) about that when it happened.

Getting this out of the way first: Part of it is that, yes, culturally we fear more for women when they are in such predicaments due to social power imbalances and general physical imbalances (i.e. a woman is generally far less likely to be able to overpower an agressor, they were literally property to be bartered and used, etc.). Its a double standard thats very ingrained in society and hard to overcome.

However, I think some of these people arguing this are forgetting just how much people hated Theons plot arc (and thus Theon himself) at the time that it aired. It just sort of meandered of into a torture-filled plot cul-de-sac that had littleif any-- impact on any of the other story lines. Robb was kicking ass up and down the country, Jon was infiltrating the wildlings, Dany was burninating the shit out of Slavers Bay, andoh, great, its just Theon being tortured again, *gdi we get it already*, get back to Arya or someone interesting already.

And adding on to that, Ramsay was almost cartoonishly over the top in his torture style (not acting wise, but action wise). Oh, man, he cut off Theons cock, thats prettyoh my god, is he literally waggling a sausage in his face, holy shit hahahawhats he gonna do next, twirl his mustache? Oh, and now hes fighting the Ironborn while shirtless after hes just had kinky sex? Is he gonna rub his hands together while exclaiming how *its all going according to plan* now?  (Quick sidenote: I actually enjoyed Theons scenes when they were aired and thought they were highly necessary from a storytelling pov, but from the comments I saw at the time I was a minority opinion.)

That sort of gratuitous style, coupled with repeatedly showing what amounted to *Theon gets tortured. Again.* sort of desensitized a lot of viewers towards Theons very real and highly disturbing physical and emotional abuse. With Sansa, however, he is rather understated and very plausible. Hes not some caricature, hes the kind of monster you could see existing in the real world. Hes not flaying fingers offall hes doing is engaging in marital rape, which was sadly commonplace throughout the world (and still does happen in disheartening numbers, unfortunately). It grounds his characters viciousness in a way that hunting women through the woods doesnt. Many more people have been/ have known someone that was raped than someone who had their dick cut off or went through such extreme mental and physical abuse. Its much easier to empathize when an evil deed is grounded in something that could conceivably happen/ has happened to you or someone you love.


Hope that gives some explaination as to why people have been hit harder than others by this episode. Id love to hear a good discussion below, both other opinions you guys might have and refutations of any of the above points. Its pretty interesting pinning down precisecly why this scene did/ didnt work.",143,257,False,self,,,,,

Specifically the BBC, they're calling it 'Game of Rape' and saying that the scene between Sansa and Ramsay was 'misogynistic.'

I'm not arguing that the scene wasn't incredibly intense and disturbing, but I didn't think it was misogynistic in any way. It wasn't objectifying Sansa, and the whole point of the scene was to shock the audience, it wasn't really a sexual thing. (It obviously was to an extent, but that wasn't the main point, in my opinion).

The scene was brutal, but it isn't the worst thing we've seen on the show. Think about the rape scene with Cersei, Oberyn's death, all these horrific scenes. 

And it wasn't as if the scene was pointless and just put in for shock value - it proved a point and furthered the story. It showed just how brutal and sadistic Ramsay is as a character and it created a very dark tone for the Winterfell storyline. It will more than likely be a pivotal scene in the series.

Jaqen is clearly able to tell every time Arya lies because he whipped her whenever she would say something like ""I stabbed the stable boy in the back"".

At the end of her story, she says that she hated the Hound and wanted him to suffer, for which she gets whipped once again by Jaqen, implying that she didn't truly hate him and didn't want him to suffer.

So for me, there are two interpretations as to why Arya refused to mercy kill The Hound:

1. She decided that he no longer deserved to be on her list because he protected her
2. She was holding out hope that he could somehow survive if she left him there.

That's why the Sand Snakes were so loved and why people looked forward to seeing them in the show.  They were all good assassins, if you will.  Kinda like grown-up Aryas.

But no, it's slighting everyone she possibly can.

As it stands she's nearly without allies. She's even alienated uncle Kevan, one of the few people she could hope to trust. Littlefinger holds the Vale, she's even gone on and told him that he can be warden of the North if he takes it back from the (presumed) rabble after Stannis the Mannis and Roose Bolton do battle.

The casting seemed to just get some girls who could fight but the Sandsnakes are supposed to be cunning, dangerous, and beautiful which these Snakes are not. I enjoy all the other parts of Dorne, Jamie and Bronn, Doran, hell even Myrcella and Trystan's scene last night was good. I am not the only one, I have talked to some of my friends who are show watchers only and even they say the Sandsnakes are bad and even when I tell them the book storyline they say they still wouldn't like it. The book did take a bit for them to be good but hopefully not too much longer. I had such high hopes going into the season now I just want to skip when they are on screen.

However, is it certain that Ned is truly his father? It is evident that there is some sort of relationship between the two because it has been explained that Jon is the spitting image of Ned. 
Isn't it possible that Jon is, in fact, Lyanna's son? Lyanna, as we all know, is Ned's beautiful sister who captivated Robert Baratheon and Rhaegar Targareon alike. Rhaegar was driven to kidnap her and rape her. 
In book one, Ned was plagued by the memory of his sister's pleading. Unfortunately, we never found out the context of the memory. Could it be that she had begot a child by Rhaegar and wanted Ned to lie for her? 
Jon would have been in imminent threat at the time because of his claim to the throne and Lyanna wanted to protect her child. 
Ned has also been attributed as being the most honorable and noble character in the series. And though it is possible he faltered, I believe he lied to save his infant nephew. With Lyanna and Rhaegar dead, he was the only one who knew and that gave him the power to rewrite history. 
As far as genetics go, Jon had been described as very Northern looking which would make sense with Lyanna being his mother. The Targaryen family with blond hair and violet eyes would have more recessive genes.

If this theory is true, Jon has king's blood. Why does this matter? Cus Melisandre is using kings blood to conjure demon monsters and all kinds of fun stuff. Possible second reason why Stannis is getting friendly with the wall? ",8,0,False,default,,,,,

I'm not complaining.  But anyway, here are a few of the plot points I find important in asoiaf and I'm not sure how they are going to fit them in with the changes they have been making:

1. Brienne forced to hunt Jaime in order to save Podrick
2. Jon betraying the night's watch to leave and save his sister (thus resulting in his death)
3. Theon's redemption
4. Marcella being named Queen by Dorne (solidifying the war of the 3...or 5 Queens) (I know this didn't actually happen)
5. Doran having an actual plan for revenge that he's keeping secret from the Sand Snakes.

There are more but I can't think of them right now.  Anyway how will the show reach these important plot points in the book given how much they have deviated.  I think #4 can be Doran's secret plan, since I'm pretty sure Quentyn isn't cast.  For #2, I don't see how Jon can abandon the watch for Sansa (fArya in the books) without the Melissandra in Castle Black assuring Jon that Ramsay's letter was truthful.  I don't see how #1 will happen.  They will probably just not do that storyline.  There are also some other plot points that are not in the book but I think are necessary for the story because they've been hyped.  And they all involve Sansa.

1. Theon saving Sansa (so his redemption arc can be complete)
2. Brienne saving Sansa (so her storyline isn't pointless)
3. The North saving Sansa (so that the North remembers stuff isn't pointless)
4. Sansa saving herself (so that all the time spent with Baelish wasn't pointless)

What do you guys think?  Can all this be done in the context of the show?  Will most of it just be omitted?  What important book plot point do you think the writers will have a hard time including in the show?

They're outraged bc innocent Sansa, who we've known since the beginning, was AGAIN victimized by a psychopath.  Although this is true, I don't think it's comparable to anything in her past.  I thought it was clear that Sansa purposely got raped.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Let's look at the facts:

1).  LF told Sansa the plan before they even got to Winterfell and she could've turned back at Moat Cailin.  She knew marriage was coming, and she knew that marriage = sex on the wedding night.  So although HOW it happened was surely not expected, there's no doubt she was willing to lose her virginity to a stranger from the outset in order to avenge her family.

2).  Not only could she have tried to run away from Winterfell (she wasn't aware of Ramsey's deadly hunting games until hours before the wedding), she also could have put a candle in the highest tower to signal for help.  Her supporters could have smuggled her out of there or something (I'm assuming that's what they'd do).  She chose not to signal for it, despite the dinner scene, Myranda's words, and other red flags that Ramsey was a psycho.

3).  The scene prepping for the wedding where she put Myranda in her place is proof of her newfound confidence/plan.  Old Sansa would've never said that.

Because of these 3 things, I'm certain that Sansa is willing to suffer in order to bring down the entire Bolton clan.  It's one thing to play the game but when you're willing to get hurt to hurt someone else more, you're truly an elite player.  That was my take on the scene.  Anyone else interpret it the same way?

But I'd wager there are lots of behind the scenes reasons why that scene was so poorly done, wouldn't you?

For example, the set was a location the Spanish government only let them use for a week of shooting, and that includes EVERY Water Gardens scene. Good, complicated fight scenes take a lot of time to shoot, and they clearly didn't have time (which is surely part of why it looked like a high school play). 

Also, boy it seems like there are lots of fight scenes. Jaime and Bronn just had a good one 2 episodes ago. The good fight scenes require a good stunt coordinator and days and days of training. I wonder, since there is a major fight every one or two episodes, are they just spread too thinly? I guess even season 1 had a fight scene every 1-2 episodes on average or so (and they were ALL great), so maybe this doesn't explain things. Did the show change stunt coordinators?

I guess maybe it's partially because the situation was contrived?

What do you think? What was it that made the battle suck so badly? ",7,8,False,self,,,,,

She thought she had this in Joffrey, but instead her betrothed turned out to be a sadistic murderer. This was a situation she was forced into, she had no choice in the matter.

Sansa has grown tremendously since that time. Her entire family has been murdered and Littlefinger has taught her how to play the game of thrones. When she and Littlefinger had the conversation overlooking Moat Cailin she wanted to turn down the offer, and the Sansa of season 1 would have. Instead she accepts it. She realizes that she currently has no way of avenging her family. Marrying into the current ruling house of the North however will make her one of the most powerful people in all the North. She willingly gives up her childhood hopes and dreams to attain power and influence.

The wedding night was horrible to watch. In reality though, it's extremely reminiscent of Dany's wedding night with Drogo, the only difference is that we have had time to get to know the characters, whereas with Dany and Drogo they were both new to us.

The acting was good (phenomenal in fact on the part of Alfie Allen,) and it was offensive in all the ways Game of Thrones often tries to be yadda yadda yadda- Nothing I suggest here is meant to detract from what it did ""good,"" if that makes sense, but again, I just didn't care for it. You know actually the internet is overflowing with people explaining (why) they didn't like that scene so i'm not even gonna dwell on that since it's not what I wanted to post about.  Let me instead explain what I think they should/could have done instead. 

Instead of having the final scene and episode cut out on Theon's traumatized face (with Sansa crying in the background,) they should have **ended with Sansa's face instead.**  They should have shot her looking **determined and focused.** Scared, in pain, sure-  but she knew what marriage to Ramsay entailed and she **chose** to go along with Littlefinger's plot anyway.  

An expertly photoshopped image to illustrate what I'm envisioning here-  [SoSorrySansa](http://imgur.com/E7JroAN)

There are three main reasons why this would have been game changing (in a good way) for that scene.

1- **It would have put the primary *focus* of the events on Sansa instead of Theon.** Ok, I understand D&amp;D have the creative liberty to focus on whatever stories and character perspectives they want but this wasn't/shouldn't have been about Theon.  Yes, I know he was (actively) engaged in the book scene with Jeyne Poole but lets be real here- he didn't just get married to his families enemy at his own home and get raped afterwards.  We already have a VERY clear image about where Theon stands in terms of his fear-based relationship with Ramsay Bolton, why pile on more?  It isn't necessarily the fact that she was raped that has everyone up in arms, (this is GoT afterall) it's that it was hardly even about her.  She seems like an accessory instead of the subject.  Benioff and Weiss are the ones that put Sansa in this situation, at the very least they should make it about her???

2- **Changed the course of the conversation after the episode**  Ask yourself what you were thinking about after finishing last night's episode. Like, really. ""Wut, oh God that's so sad.  Poor Sansa. (again)  Why does she keep getting screwed over?  The amount of Rape in this show is too damn high.  This is just about shock value at this point, it's not even substance."" Whatever it may be.  Now imagine how you would have felt if the ending scene was *Sansa's* face instead of Theon's.  And then imagine her in control, at least mentally- knowing that she'll eventually position herself in a place of influence just like her ""uncle"" has been teaching her.  Eh, eh?  For me this is a night and day's difference in terms of interpretation of events.  (And no, i'm not trying to discredit the foulness of rape when that sentence)  

3- **Contribute To instead of Break Down her character Arc**  Ok this assumes that this is even the direction Sansa is going in the story.  D &amp; D know how these characters play out over the long term, and they're expected to illustrate that albeit with their own creative interpretations.  But they've spent the last season and a half *adding* content to Sansa's storyline and perpetuating her character into one that will eventually mimic/learn from Littlefinger's.  Sure that's a generalization but this rape scene in the context it was presented largely squashed that direction. I mean hell, we had that sassy scene with Miranda not ten minutes before! Sansa was starting to look like she had some direction. You know what this rape scene seemed like it'll lead up to?  A Theon redemption story.  Instead of Sansa utilizing her situation at Winterfell to her benefit, or manipulating her way into escape (the expected direction of her character) it'll be about how Theon was driven to the brink and saved his helpless ""sister.""  

I don't know there's a lot someone could say but right now i'm just kind of bummed they didn't do more with that scene.  I mean, if it just ""had"" to be there they should have made something of it.   Thoughts?

Thought the daughters ""My Father.."" monologue was pretty badass and clearly established what kind of a person she is, even if it is a bit out of the blue. The fight scene in the latest episode did seem particularily clunky I must admit. Don't really have anything to say about the acting or casting, they've had very little dialogue.

For me, the scene instantly reminded me of Dany's first night with Khal Drogo. The scene played out in almost exactly the same way, and Dany was eventually able to turn the situation to her advantage and gain the power she currently has. Everyone is bitching about how the scene stripped away any power that Sansa had gained. I disagree completely. Cersei once told her that ""the most powerful weapon you have is between your legs"". Sansa may yet learn to use this power over Ramsay, when he is at his most vulnerable. Additionally, I don't understand how so many people were shocked by this. What did you expect from Ramsay-fucking-Bolton? A nice game of Scrabble before they turn in? Game of Thrones has always been an uncompromising, realistic view of living in a feudal fantasy, and this final scene was a perfect example of the struggles of women in that time.

**This is my own personal opinion on that final scene. You may agree or disagree as you see fit.**

I think it's safe to say that I'm not alone in the opinion that watching last night's episode was difficult. Seeing Sansa go from one awful situation after another, with no real control or say, can be upsetting or frustrating to many. Watching her be raped is just the cherry on top.

But was it rape?

An idea I see used all the time, everywhere, is that the ""dominant"" party in any relationship must hold all the power and anyone who submits must therefore have no power. This is not necessarily true. Sometimes, those who appear to submit are merely giving what the other party wants to further their own goals.

And Sansa has already learned this lesson.

When she was alone, trapped in King's Landing with a psychotic child-king as her betrothed, Sansa submitted. She told him what he wanted to hear and did what he wanted her to do. He hurt her, tormented her, and she took it with minimal protest. 

And then Joffrey wanted to kill a drunken knight on his birthday, and Sansa had him spare the man. All the while still being submissive. Dont get me wrong. Joffrey held most of the power in their relationship. But Sansa was still able to get the tiniest bit back by giving in and being what he wanted.

I believe that on the night of her wedding to Ramsay, she still remembered this lesson. She gave in, let him have what he wanted and let him think she was a victim.

When the time comes that she can strike back, he wont see her coming.

Essentially it would be Stannis VS Vale/Boltons with the chance for Littlefinger to turn on the Boltons and secure Winterfell with Sansa
As compared to Stannis VS Manderly/Freys with the chance of Manderlys turning on the Freys. 

Also, what on earth happened to Arys Oakheart on the show? We see a Kingsguard in the boat when Myrcella leaves, but I guess he fell overboard and was never seen again!

I think yesterday's episode began to show cracks of what could happen to Game of Thrones in future seasons without the writers having something to adapt from.

The TV show was what introduced me to ASOIAF. I managed to read all of the books before S5 and, like many of the book readers in this sub, my hype was faltered when some characters/events were shown to be replaced or taken out all together for the sake of speeding up to the climatic parts in the books. 

I feel that the events in Dorne, as well as Yara's subplot last season, are examples of a ""dumbing down"" that we're experiencing so TV viewers could ""get"" what's going on easier. It's offensive to the viewers that they're getting such cliche characters and unnecessary subplots on a TV show that's been hailed in past seasons as being smart, entertaining, and rewarding to viewers who pay attention.

IMO, I would say that the episode was set pretty well until the ridiculous scene in Dorne where Jaime and Bronn waltz into the Water Gardens and fight the Sand Snakes. The choreography and the cheesy lines from the characters seem so out of place in the show. After this, the viewers are then treated to Sansa's unfortunate wedding night. This feels absolutely unnecessary to the viewer, and feels like it was all set up as blatant shock value, mainly because the episode felt ""dumbed down"".

This episode has me feeling nervous for future episodes. I guess I just don't want to be spoiled future book plot lines with bad writing and wooden acting from future characters, like the Sand Snakes seem to be giving off. I know this show is awesome, the last seasons are some of the best TV we've seen in a while. I just don't want GoT to go down the Dexter track. What are your opinions?

I'm not sure who would choose the champion to fight against him, but I believe a ""Frankensteined"" Gregor Clegane (The Mountain) will be the one chosen. 

After all, Cersei has the maester who healed jaime's infected wrist using non contemporary medicine to heal ser Gregor from Oberyn's poison. 

If this happens, would Loras be able to fight for Margery and his own freedom, or would it only free himself?

I'm not saying that Arya ever forgave The Hound for anything, but they had definitely developed a complicated relationship and camaraderie during their journey together, beyond the simple hatred that she had for him.

Arya isn't purposely lying either. It's more likely that she hasn't completely internalized how she really feels about The Hound, and she doesn't want to face the possibility that she might have developed a positive connection with him.  So she keeps on insisting, to herself and to Jaqen, that she only feels hatred for him.

But that wouldn't be enough for him, he wants everything.
He's tight with the Boltons after delivering Sansa as a bride. He's tight was Sansa after saving her from Cersei. He's tight with Cersei after promising to deliver Sansa's death. He's tight with the Martells after delivering Joffrey's death. He really is quite the flesh-peddler.

Here's what I would do if I were him:  (I haven't read or researched, I'm just confidant)
He'll probably save the Boltons by warning them that they're going to bear the brunt of Stannis' invasion, and they'll bail. Maybe the Boltons will use a need to fight back against the Ironborn as an excuse, I would. He told Cersei of a plan to play two armies off each other and then come and clean up after: I bet that's foreshadowing of what he'll do with an army from the Vale after the Lannister army and Stannis go at it.

He'll be everyone's hero: Sansa is saved from Cersei, Robin is safe from the fighting, the Boltons will have been warned of what would otherwise be their end, and with noone to support the king, Olena will be happily looking to replace the royal family with someone else.
The road to the Iron Throne will be paved for Littlefinger. He'll be allied with the Vale, he already has the Riverlands himself, he'll be allied with the Iron Islands if the Boltons win that fight I suggested, hell be allied with HighGarden, and hell be seen as the one that won the war.
It's seems like Sansa is a key, but at this point it doesn't even matter what happens to her, he has three overlapping strategies: If Sansa is still with Ramsay, Littlefinger will be allied with the North through the Boltons, if she escapes, he'll be her only ally, and if Cersei gets her, he'll be Warden.

With the exception of Dorne, that's every kingdom in Westeros either defeated in battle or ripe to support him as king.

EDIT: I know I seem to be underestimating Stannis the Mannis, but he can't keep an army without coin, and when the Iron Bank compares Davos' little speech to Littlefinger's resume as Master of Coin, they'll go with Littlefinger.",0,4,False,self,,,,,

In previous seasons, I always found it interesting how much of a disconnect there was between viewers and readers regarding Stannis. Understandable, because he was not portrayed quite as likeably in the show as in the books, and also due to timing. 

The events at Winterfell this season occured in aDwD, which was released between seasons 1 and 2 of the tv show. So when Stannis first shows up in the show in S2, readers were (and still are) fresh off the events that are now happening in the show.

Do you feel it? Do you feel the power of the Mannis himself. He is a brave warrior, a just ruler, a stoic father, a generous boat-lender, a master of the English language.

In episode 506 he basically asks for Cersei to make him warden of the north in exchange for ridding witherfell of the boltons and/or The Baratheons depending on who wins the battle for the north. 
If Stannis destroys the Boltons (which I really hope happens), I think Petyr will bring the men of the Vale to him to him and swear fealty before him. To me, Stannis wouldn't refuse; because, a) he needs the men to take kings landing, and b) because the Baratheons and the men of the Vale were once in an alliance against the mad king. (remember when he told Roose that the men of the north and the men of the vale brought down the greatest dynasty the world had ever seen? I think he'll tell Stannis the same thing) Maybe he'll ask to be the warden of the west when the Lannisters are destroyed!(probably not though)

If the boltons beat Stannis, he'll swoop in with the knights of the vale and crush them. Thus becoming warden of the north. Either way, he lives to ""serve"" and by doing so stays on everyone's good side. Perhaps when Dany comes to westeros he'll bend the knee for her and use all his influence to support her, in return for even more power.

Maybe I am wrong about all of this, but it's fun to speculate.

Given what little he knows compared to the viewer, it's understandable that he's not willing to throw himself to one side or the other, yet.  

Ironically, if this is the case, then him having *some* knowledge leads to a worse result than him having no knowledge.

The last scene was quite a powerful one and for myself is one of the most emotionally intense scenes in the show, up there with Ned's death and the Red Wedding. I, even knowing how brutal the world of Game of Thrones is, found myself hoping that someone would swoop in and do something to stop this. We've watched Sansa grow up in front of us (age 13 in season 1) and to see this happen to her made everyone furious... and that's a good thing.

The one thing that immediately struck me with Game of Thrones unlike every other show on television is it's realistic portrayal of every human emotion and the lack of clear cut 'protagonist/s' and 'antagonist/s'. This show is less like following some good guys and some bad guys and more about the greater picture of a medieval world in complete chaos. No character is safe, no one can outrun death forever, as the saying goes ""Valar morghulis (All men must die). This is made clear to us in the FIRST EPISODE where a boy of only 10 years is crippled for life and nearly dies. Your predisposition to have the good guys win eventually is immediately brought to question, why should the good guys win? Does that make a story good? For an art form such as television (yes I consider TV to be art) to truly become respected we must throw out all notion that we must ""feel good"" when the credits roll, that we should be satisfied completely with what we have just seen. After S1E9 ""Baelor"" I sat for 10 minutes processing what I had just seen and could not, did not want to believe it was true. I then played the next episode (I began watching in December of 2011, so I had every episode) and my fear was confirmed. The main character, a character who had been built up so much over the whole season brutally killed in front of his own children. I had seen many scenes of violence and brutality but that scene made my heart sink, I was furious. 

This brings me to last nights episode.

I was watching this scene and felt the exact same emotion I had felt during the last 10 minutes of ""Baelor"". This couldn't really be happening, could it? Surely not? I knew this was a possibility but they won't actually go through with it right? This is the response I crave from a television show that claims to be any where near ""good"" or ""artistic"". We should revel in the fact that a show can make us feel such emotions. A show based in a FAKE world with FAKE characters and FAKE history. Shakespeare was not famous for making plays which had people running through fields of grass with rainbows and bunnies, his gritty realism made his work strike an immense emotional chord with his audience. People who claim that ""this was not necessary, she was already dragged through the dirt, we didn't need to see this"" are completely missing the point. You're not supposed to feel nice after the episode ends, you're supposed to be disgusted; you're supposed to think that was not necessary. As far as brutality goes, it's not that interesting of a scene. We've seen rape before, we've seen murder, warfare, execution and infanticide. In fact I would say this scene has less to do with Ramsay and Sansa and more to do with Theon (brilliant acting from Alfie Allen by the way). Looking at Theon's face during this ordeal is not to take away from Sansa's suffering, it magnifies it. 

You have to consider Theon's relationship to Sansa. Being Ned's ward Theon has lived most of his life with the Starks, he watched Sansa grow up from a baby to who she is now. She is practically his little sister. Actually go back and watch the scene. This is the first time we've seen ""Theon"" and not Reek for a long time. Hints of rage, sorrow, guilt are plastered all over his face and desperation in Sansa's eyes as she looks to Theon for help,even though she hated him, she needed him in that moment. This will be the turning point for both of these characters and while they may never be friends again, Theon and Sansa will both rise again from this harder and stronger.

We aren't supposed to feel only one emotion, we should feel sick to our stomachs. We This show represents humanity as a whole not just our greatest hits. It shows US in all our love and kindness and horrible horrible brutality. I'm going to go ahead and say D&amp;D have made a good decision from a plot perspective (at least in the TV show universe) and have slammed us back into the reality of our favourite show. 

(Except those Sand Snakes though, just please make them stop).

TL;DR TV shows should be about all of our emotions. These emotions we have aren't new, we're just feeling them anew. What is dead may never die.

This is just how I feel about the show but I decided I would write something as I have seen a lot of criticism of the scene and the character arc of Sansa. 
I would like to hear other's opinions on this aspect of the show including Sansa, Theon and Ramsay as characters as well as the scene itself.
This is a good discussion I was watching which inspired me to write

Just wanted to test out my predictions for where the series is going with the plot with Sansa, and how they might incorporate some elements from the book that haven't made it into the show as of yet.

The first thing I thought they might be hinting at was relating to Ramsay's jealousy of his father's expectant new son.  In the books, it is an important part of Ramsay's backstory- and something that put a wedge between himself and Roose- that Ramsay is the prime suspect in the murder of Roose's legitimate son.  In the book, this other son was Ramsay's elder, however, it would make sense for dramatic purposes to shuffle this around a bit and to have Ramsay carry out a similar deed during the events of the show.

This could all tie in to Sansa's story.  This is based on a single expression on Sansa's face during episode 5.  At the dinner, Roose announces the pregnancy, causing clear discomfort in the previously cocksure and arrogant Ramsay.  Sansa reacts to this with a little smirk while Ramsay looks down, dejected.  While this may simply be what it appears to be on the face of it- that Sansa was glad to see Ramsay get shot down a bit- it could also represent a ""gotcha"" realization on Sansa's part.  She may have realized that this internal piece of family drama could be just what she needs to get the Boltons fighting amongst themselves.

In other words, my suggestion is that, in that moment, Sansa formed a plan to convince (or more likely, quietly manipulate) Ramsay into thinking that killing the new baby, or perhaps Fat Walda, is the best course of action to secure his place as heir to the Bolton dynasty.  The audience already knows that Ramsay doubts his father's commitment to his newly granted legitimacy- Sansa just needs to nurture that.

Admittedly, this all made a bit more sense before the events of episode 6. The only way that this theory survives all of that is if we accept that Sansa was aware of the marriage bedding ordeal she would be subjected to, and that she is purposefully presenting herself as too meek and ineffective to do much scheming.  The only basis for this theory- which I am not too comfortable with since I'm not sure the show needed to have any more forced sex for plot purposes- is to look at things Sansa said previously.  She said to Littlefinger that she expected she would be married before he got back from King's Landing.  Presumably, having been married before, she was aware of what that entails on the wedding night in Westerosi culture, and probably did not expect for Ramsay to be as kind-hearted as Tyrion proved to be.

Second, Sansa has shown herself to actually be quite hardened and pragmatic when dealing with anyone besides Ramsay and Roose, i.e., that her development into Dark Sansa remains intact.  She makes it clear to Miranda that she isn't taking any crap, and she is utterly cold to Theon. It is only when before the Boltons that she puts on the naive, hesitant facade that once characterised her.  Of course, her reluctance during the wedding and what followed was likely more genuine, and she probably underestimated how much of a lunatic Ramsay was- he had been playing her as well up until that point, masking (albeit not very effectively, given his parading of Reek) his sadism with a pleasant persona.

As a final note, the method of murder that might be used could end up incorporating the ""Frey Pie"" into the story.  In the books, it is Lord Manderley, a secret enemy of the Bolton's and Stark sympathizer who has some Frey men killed and baked into a pie fora feast at Winterfell.  Manderley is not in the series, and there appear not the be any Freys in Winterfell.  Except one. Walda.   Perhaps this is where the plot is heading.

I acknowledge the incredible likelihood that this is all wrong and a case of extreme confirmation bias, however it is fun to think about and discuss this stuff!
  

TL;DR- Sansa is undertaking a long con in an effort to make herself appear like the meek, doting wife in an effort to cause Ramsay to strike against his Father, using the one key sore-point between them.  ",5,2,False,self,,,,,

And then during the next seasons, we sees three of his ""sons"" behand soemone :

- Theon beheads Ser Rodrick
- Robb beheads Lord Karstark
- Jon beheads Janos Slynt

And during all three of this scenes, the atmosphere is very different from the scene with Ned. The music is dark and is the same for all three scenes, and each time, Theon/Robb/Jon feels forced to behead the guy, to show everyone that he's in charge, while Ned didn't need to show that he was in charge, he just did what he had to do.

In the end, both Ned and Robb got beheaded, so I expect the same fate for Theon and Jon.

Honorable mention for Bran who almost beheaded a guy barehands while inside Hodor.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

First off, I saw it as a mercy murder really, she felt differently. Unsure why Arya would murder the girl and she'd be punished for it. But then my SO said something, I forget what, but it triggered in my memory something I couldn't recall.

**Did Arya Stark ever give back the 3rd life she stole from Death?** In one of the earlier seasons, she free'd JH. He told her that a girl has taken 3 lives from Death and that the debt must be repaid. We saw her give him 2 names, but I don not recall a 3rd. **EDIT** (*so people don't think I forgot*) I recall her giving JH as the 3rd name but then parlaying that into an escape from Tywin's campt. Could it be that this poor mercy killing can be seen as the 3rd life given back to Death. And that this is why she is now allowed into the room of faces?

The reason Cersei is backing the new High Sept, the Sparrows, the Faith Militant, etc... is because they are seen by the people to be legitimate in the eyes of the Seven. They are doing much of the charitable work in Fleabottom. It's widely rumored that Tommen himself is an abomination- a product of incest. If the Kingsguard were to turn a bunch of of Faith Militant into martyrs and turn the Great Sept red with blood, he would lose any legitimacy he would have left.

An initial heavy handed response from the King would only bring about an insurrection similar to the Sons of the Harpy in Meeren. Tommen has to be smarter than Joffrey &amp; Danereys were if he wants to last. In the end heads will have to be chopped off, but before that he has to establish a stronger base of support than what Cersei has already setup. ""Playing the game"" is more than court politics, but also public manipulation. Not effectively moving the masses to your will can foment rebellion or strength your enemies within the nobility. He can't afford either at this early stage of his rule.

So how do the Tyrells &amp; possibly Tommen get out of this? By being smarter. 

 * Utilize they Tyrell's popularity with the people
 * A public charm offensive to boost the Tyrell's popularity with the people
 * Discredit the Faith militant by exposing their own hypocrisy &amp; also discredit the Lannisters (especially Cersei)
 * Use agent provocateurs to question the Faith Militant's fundamentalism
 * Side with other nobles in Kings Landing that were on the wrong side of the Faith Militant 
 * Expose Cersei's hypocrisy before the laws of the Seven

Only after the Faith Militant is discredited can Tommen recend the Faith Militant's permission to hold arms and send Goldcloaks and/or Kingsguard to disarm them. If they cannot be disarmed while Cersei playing such a huge role then the goal has to be to discredit Cersei first before disarming the Faith Militant. A public confession from D&amp;D's favorite Sparrow Lancel would do that. A second measure would be to instigate a riot &amp; Tommen ask Kevan to return to Kings Landing from Casterly Rock, from which he can initiate martial law, disarm the Faith Militant, and send Cersei packing to Casterly Rock or a dungeon.

Time will tell how he moves, but it takes time. As timid as Tommen appear, it's vastly better to be cautious than rash.",3,4,False,self,,,,,

The trial scene looked like a farce because it was a farce. This is Game of Thrones, and the High Sparrow is a man in power. In Game of Thrones, people in power are usually up to something. This being said, there is a good chance that the High Sparrow is up to something.


We know that Cersei is looking for allies, and we know that Cersei put the High Sparrow in power; Cersei is looking to make an ally out of the High Sparrow and he knows it. There is a 99.99(repeating)% chance that Cersei is the one who told the High Sparrow about Loras being gay, even though this is repeatedly noted as being common knowledge. Cersei bringing it up, however, leads the High Sparrow to believe that Cersei wants to stir shit up with the Tyrells.


The High Sparrow goes along with it, arrests Loras, tests the crown's resolve. Tommen rolls up to the Sept assuming having the crown gives him a big dick. The faith militant is unimpressed with his dick and turns him away. Instead of whipping it out, Tommen turns tail and goes home. The High Sparrow sees that Tommen is weak and Cersei is strong (albeit reckless). 


Cut to the inquisition. The High Sparrow knows Tommen isn't going to do shit, regardless of what goes down. He also knows that Cersei wants shit stirred up with the Tyrells. But let's think about what else he knows...


Do you think there's a chance that Lancel didn't confess his bedding with Cersei? Because I don't. Maybe the faith puts up with family-fucking (see: The Targaryens) but they sure as shit won't put up with extra-marital affairs or conspiring to murder. Also, armed with this knowledge, wouldn't the faith (now that it is recognized as a military body) want to put forth a formal inquisition for Tommen's parentage? Hmmm...


For the faith to arrest the queen's brother and the queen herself on the word of a squire is outrageous. But the High Sparrow knows the crown will do nothing and Cersei will be pleased. Olenna can only look on in horror, powerless to do anything for her grandchildren (not to mention the probability that Meryn Trant will throw her son off of a boat). This inquisition is just smoke and mirrors to lull Cersei into a false sense of comfort thinking that her rivals will be eliminated and the faith will be her ally.


What is the High Sparrow really doing? What does he really want? I have no idea. Seven Hells, not even the book readers know. But I'm really excited to see the payoff.


The inquisition looked like a farce because it was a farce. I believe the trial was perceived exactly as it was meant to be perceived... but then again with all of the crap happening in Dorne, maybe it was just another garbage scene that D&amp;D let go to TV.",4,17,False,self,,,,,

It seems a little odd that this is what is considered too brutal.... hell Theon as an example was tortured/brutalized (whether you consider it worse or not doesn't really matter, lets just say both Sansa this last episode and Theon himself seasons before have been tortured by a psychopath both physically and mentally). Was it somehow okay to victimize Theon in such a brutal way, but not Sansa?

One of the points I'm seeing that I can partially understand is some people are saying its just perpetuating the idea that Sansa is a victim and people feel D&amp;D are somehow being sexist and perpetuating rape culture, but this newly strong women being ""put back in her place."" (Note this argument I read on a several posts here in this subreddit as reasons for why the scene was the line). At what point did reality shift to the point where a story has to follow certain rules/guidelines? I mean this story itself has portrayed (both in the books and the show) men, women, children, etc. all in vulnerable positions, all being weak, all being strong, etc. At what point can a show or story HAVE to show a woman in this position being weak or strong? Why does some hidden meaning have to be involved beyond the point of the story? A lot of people are saying they will only forgive this scene if Sansa grows from it and is strong, and while I can say those hoping that are most likely right.... why does that matter? As long as it has a purpose to the story, isn't that what should matter? The moment we start forcing our forms of storytelling to follow rules on what is or isn't ok.... I dunno thats a scary thought and stifles any sort of creativity/storytelling that we have come to enjoy.


Anyway guess I'm just a bit confused and thought I'd write out some thoughts and see what some of you think, maybe I'll learn something! I look at that scene as just another way this story can get people to really feel. The acting was superb, the way it was shot fantastic... I really doubt anyone watching didn't feel sickened and just utter dread(fort heh...). That should be what this is about.",10,9,False,self,,,,,

So my theory begins with the fact that every man from Braavos is very respectful towards Arya's coin. But why would they be?

With the coin come the words ""valaar morghulis""-all men must die. The answer is ""valaar dohaeris""-all men must serve. When she is going around braavos everyone who helps her tells her ""when you get there, tell them who helped you come"". House of black and white is an institution for taking care of sick and the dying. So basically, by saying ""valaar morghulis"" to them, she reminds the men from Braavos that they will die, and eventually come to the house of black and white. so it's best to help someone who will possibly take care of them when they're sick and/or dying.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

Not the best episode ever, but for a midseason plot filled episode it was good. I'll go through the episode and talk about why I liked each part and why I think some of the criticisms are invalid. Three scenes in particular have drawn a lot of criticisms, two of which I can defend, one I admit was pretty much garbage. 

Arya and the House of B&amp;W- I really liked this stroyline this week. I thought the acting was pretty phenomenal and the whole am I lying part was interesting and surprising. The game of faces is incredible and idea of becoming no one and how a girl does that is thought provoking. The room of faces was pretty stunning as well. 

Tyrion and Jorah- Pretty awesome scences. Tyrion's wit is always entertaining and I can't think of another way someone could utter the words ""the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant"" being completely serious. 

Littlefinger- His plans are always entertaining and interesting. I think he is the only one to consistently come out on top because he is always being underestimated. Cersei knows she needs him and the armies of the Vale but she doesn't believe he can be a threat on his own. Littlefinger knows this and knows he can use it. He is a little weasel and and I love him for it.

Jamie, Bronn, and the Sand Snakes- Alright I admit the sand snakes are pretty awful. But Bronn as always was delightful. His trash talk as they are all being led away by the guards was hilarious. So yes this scene was one of the worst ever in Game of Thrones due to the bad acting and poor fight scene that could have been incredible but it had at least one redeeming aspect in Bronn and was pretty short so let's just move on. 

Olenna v. Cersei- The showdown between the most powerful women in Westeros. I know this portion of the show  has taken a lot of heat but I think it played out as it should have. Olenna and Cersei's talk was funny and revealing. I love the parallel someone drew between Tywin and Cersei both writing at their desk while having a discussion. The difference being Cersei gets called out on her shit showing she is not as skilled at the game as Tywin was and she thinks she is. The trial was interesting, I was expecting the to bring in one of Loras's bedfellows but didn't know if they would lie or not. And them taking Margaery too was bold and daring. I want to know if that was always Cersei's plan or if the sparrows are getting more daring. The people asking why Tommen didn't step in must not have watched the rest of the show. Tommen has always been a weak little momma's boy. He has been a pawn played between Cersei and Margaery this whole season and to expect that to change in one scene would make no sense. He was probably under the assumption that Loras would be freed, he wasn't and that probably through him. Then they arrested margaery and had her out of the room in less than 10 seconds. If a character completely changed their personality in 10 seconds this wouldn't be a very good show. I think this will lead to Tommen beginning to think for himself a bit and starting to question his mother but that will take time. Plus I am excited to see what Olenna will do next.

Sansa- So we'll get to the final scene in a minute but first let's talk about Sansa's first scene and what led up to this moment. For the first four seasons Sansa was one of my least favorite if the worst character on the show. She was dumb, whiney, naive, got used, made mistakes, and was boring. At least with Cersei, Joffrey, Ramsay, they were interesting. You hated them and wanted them to lose, but when they were on screen you knew something was going to happen. When Sansa was on screen it was time for a nap. This has started to change and I love it. Sansa is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters and I really hope she becomes wardeness of the North. Although this probably means she is going to die pretty soon. The part in this episode I loved is the bathtub scene. When Myranda tries to fuck with her and Sansa just says ""Bitch, get out my face"" I almost cheered. But then they show her alone, and she is scared and a little unsure. This I think was pretty great and one of the most real character developments. She isn't going to become Wardeness overnight but she is starting to play the game even if she is a little unsure of the moves right now. And this brings us to the most controversial part of the episode...

The Wedding Night- So we all knew Ramsay was dick. The same people who thought Tommen would have stepped in to save the Tyrells probably thought that this wedding night was going to consist of consensual passionate lovemaking. The Bolton's betrayed and murdered Sansa's family so even if Ramsay was the nicest guy in the world this wouldn't have been a 100% consenual night. That being said I don't think anyone including Sansa thought it would be that fucked up. But again its not out of character for any of them. Ramsay is psychopath who enjoys torture and hunting ex girlfriends. Theon is a broken shell of a man (although we may see this is beginning to change). Sansa is a new player in the game and didn't know how to stop it. She was knew she would have to consummate the marriage but she didn't expect that. Everything made sense in the fucked up world of GoT.

The rape scene has gotten a ton of flack with people especially feminist saying that the show has gone to far. I disagree though, I think that this may have been the ""best"" for lack of a better word rape of a main character in terms of its affect on culture and the audience. Correct me if I'm wrong but I remember three times when main characters were raped. Dany by Drogo, Cersei by Jamie, and Sansa by Ramsay. Dany and Drogo was early in the show. No one had really formed any attachment to either character, it was kind of expected on their wedding night that they would have sex although Dany was not ready. Also there is the whole its another culture thing how can you judge when that's pretty much how all sex was done with the Dothraki. (Side note  and book spoiler, I liked this scene better in the Book with Drogo preparing Dany until she was calm and ready. Really got those romance juices flowing) So this scene is often forgotten and some people might not really consider it a rape. Jamie and Cersei was pretty fucked up situation to begin with and arguably the worst of the three. Cersei says no and Jamie forces it anyway. This one might be the worst because of Jamie's redemption path prior and after this scene. At that point in the show you are rooting for Jamie and against Cersei, so when this happens an average viewer isn't really all that bothered by it. Which makes this the worst one for making a statement about rape in the real world. Cersei had some bad karma coming her way maybe this is just the world working itself out. And that brings us to Sansa. This is the exact opposite of Jamie and Cersei. The viewer now has all the sympathy for the victim and none for the rapist. It was difficult to watch and made most people pretty upset. And I think this is a good thing. Rape shouldn't be easy to watch. This might be the closest some viewers get to understanding the experience. It was horrible and sickening. When rape comes up in the real world someone who has no understanding and idea of it is no longer brought back to Cersei getting some Universal justice, its of someone you have grown to like being hurt and brutalized. I also think they have the chance to go in a good direction with this arc. Sansa can be more than a victim and as I said I am really rooting for her. I think this could be a good set up to her finally getting some revenge. ",32,54,False,self,,,,,

I am a day late, so let's not hesitate and get into this..  Today I am breaking away from the LORE and Back story posts and diving fully into my first full Book v Show breakdown of a particular story arc this season.  Today that being the differences in the relationship Cersei has with that of House Tyrell, and try to cover almost all the crucial differences from the Battle of the Blackwater aftermath in ""A Clash of Kings"" to Queen Margaery's arrest in ""A Feast for Crows"". I am also using the bullet point format for this installment that I have used in the past (like I did with the Wildling post last season) instead of my usual format.  Well enough introduction let's get to the topic at hand...

------------------------

**Note On Spoiler Scope**

This is going to be a bit different as I am not tackling LORE in this post... As I have already stated I will be breaking down book to show differences involving the Cersei/Tyrell arc.. The vast majority of this post will come from what happens in ""A Feast for Crows"" though a few differences from both ""A Storm or Swords"" as well as ""A Clash of Kings"" will also be mentioned.  The differences are significant, and will be covered in detail.. I tagged this S5/ADWD for benefit of the comments section; though I will not mention any ADWD material in this post, the show is covering that material so I wanted that to be open in the comments as well..(though only up to where we are in the show) Okay, with the formalities out of the way let's get to the good stuff.


------------------------

**- House Tyrell brought into the fold, post Blackwater**

There isn't too much different here to discuss that is different from the show vs the book.  In the books and in the show, with the help of Petyr Baelish, House Tyrell joins forces with the Lannisters against Stannis Baratheon and help save King's Landing from his siege on the city, and for their efforts they are honored.  Margaery Tyrell is betrothed to Joffrey Baratheon, casting aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark.  However the biggest difference comes from the honoring of Ser Loras Tyrell.  In the novels, Loras is not the only male child and heir to Lord Mace Tyrell, Loras is the youngest of three Sons of Mace.  Mace's eldest son and heir to Highgarden is named Willas Tyrell, and his second son a knight named Ser Garlan Tyrell... Garlan Tyrell is actually present in Kings Landing throughout the events of A Storm of Swords.   As for Loras himself, as part of the ceremony honoring the heroes of the Battle of Blackwater, he requests a spot on Joffrey Baratheon's Kingsguard, to which Joffrey obliges. Loras is given a white cloak replacing Ser Mandon Moore who had been killed in battle.  On another small note, the simultaneous betrothal of Margaery and Loras being named to the Kingsguard is not fully happenstance.. Even before the Queen of Thorns questioning of Sansa in ASOS, rumors of Joffrey's reputation had reached them.. naming the brother of the future queen to the Kingsguard in reality was a very practical move to make, and should the need arise, to protect her from what Joff was capable of. 


**-A Storm of Failed Marriage Proposals**

Moving onto ""A Storm of Swords"" let's discuss the failed plot of the Tyrells to have Sansa Stark marry into house Tyrell.. If you recall from Season 3.  The Tyrells, particularly Olenna Tyrell had attempted to arrange the marriage of Sansa Stark to Loras Tyrell before the plan reached Tywin Lannister who hastily snuffed it out by arranging a marriage between Sansa and his own son Tyrion Lannister.. Thus cutting out the Tyrell attempt to gain leverage by marring their family into the heir of the North.  This played out very similarly in the novels, however the persons involved were very different.  As Loras was named into the Kingsguard and could not take a wife, no arrangement was made to marry Sansa to him, instead the Tyrells sought to marry Sansa to the heir of Highgarden, Willas Tyrell, currently at Highgarden while the rest of his family was at court in Kings Landing.  This move served the purpose it did in the show, giving the Tyrells the key to the north by way of Marriage, and was too snuffed out by Tywin Lannister when word of the proposal reached his ears.  After foiling their plans to marry Willas to Sansa, Tywin did propose an arrangement to marry Willias to his widowed daughter Cersei, but that too was rebuffed by House Tyrell.  

Before I go to my next bullet point a bit more on Willas Tyrell.  While he does not appear in the novels, he is described as gentlemanly, kind, and smart.. Exactly what you would want in an heir to Highgarden, he is however crippled.  During a tourney he was crippled by none other than Oberyn Martell, when during a joust Willas was knocked from his saddle and his leg caught in the stirrup, his horse fell on top of him crushing his leg.  This is one additional reason that hostility exists between House Martell and House Tyrell, though Willas and the Red Viper themselves remain friends, even after this incident. 

**- The Purple Wedding**

This one will be a bit short, the background of the Tyrell involvement in the death of Joffrey Baratheon is almost the same in the show as it is in the books, with a few minor differences.  Things play out the same in both mediums, Sansa is given something to wear, by Dontos Hollard to Joffrey's wedding, a necklace with hidden poison in the show, a hairnet in the books.  And in both mediums it is implied if not outright stated that Littlefinger worked with House Tyrell in accomplish this goal.  However one notable difference is that the seeds for this plot are given earlier in the books than in the show.  In ""A Clash of Kings"" Sansa is given the poison hairnet shortly after the ceremony honoring the heroes of the Battle of Blackwater, PRIOR to being questioned about Joffrey by the Queen of Thorns.  This implies that the Tyrell/Littlefinger scheme went back much further than being reactionary to learning of Joffrey's nature, or the result of the Red Wedding as Littlefinger states in the show..  Regardless in either medium, Tyrion Lannister takes the blame for Joffrey's murder and no one suspects Tyrell involvement, and are happily represented by Mace Tyrell as a judge in Tyrion's trial.  


**- The Gaoler's Coin**

In the aftermath of the Murder of Tywin Lannister by his own son Tyrion there is quite a bit that happens that is not shown in the show.  The books detail Queen Cersei being delivered the news of her father's death and the paranoia she has about those around her, the Tyrells included. But one of the primary turning points for her paranoia regarding House Tyrell comes after Cersei learns that Tyrion escaped the black cells.  In the books she does not suspect nor know Jaime was the one who set Tyrion free.  She suspects Lord Varys as he too has mysteriously disappeared following the murder.  Cersei also seeks to have the Gaolers in charge of guarding Tyrion questioned and punished for letting Tyrion escape, it is here where it is learned that one gaoler, by the name of Rugen has also disappeared.  During a search of his cell a coin is found beneath his privy.  The coin is that of a Gardner King, dating back years before the conquest of Aegon Targaryen.  The fact that a centuries old coin that could only come from the Reach is found in the chambers of a no-name gaoler, one that was supposed to be guarding Tyrion convinces Cersei that House Tyrell had something to do with Tyrion's escape, and the Murder of her father.  However while Cersei nor the other characters around her know, but the reader knows that the gaoler Rugen in reality was one of the many cover identities of Lord Varys.  Now why did Varys have an ancient coin from the reach, and why would he leave it purposely in his chambers?  Did he conspire with the Tyrells to free Tyrion as Cersei believes.  The reader knows this is not the case as in ASOS we see Varys free Tyrion from his cell under Jaime's orders.  But as we know from the books and from the show, Varys is making efforts with a monarch across the narrow seas to make their return to Westeros.. Purposely planting this coin serves to sew animosity and mistrust houses Tyrell and Lannister, making for an unstable realm down the road... 


**-Margaery and King Tommen**

The differences in Queen Margaery's and King Tommen's relationship is VERY different in the books vs the show, as is how Cersei reacts to her only remaining son marrying into that house.  First of all is the age of Tommen.. He is only eight years old in the books, and his mother is his acting regent.  Tommen and Margaery do marry shortly after the funeral of Lord Tywin, but for obvious reasons the marriage is not consummated.  Maragery does have a role in the development of Tommen though and it causes the same animosity in Queen Cersei as it does in the show.   While their relationship is not sexual as it is with the much older show-Tommen, Book-Margaery is very much inclined on gaining the young King's favor, spending much time with Tommen and making him warm up to her company and having her around and even convinces the young King to circumvent the decisions of his mother.   She even arranges for Ser Loras to help teach Tommen how to fight.. All of these efforts make Cersei's paranoia grow, as she slowly sees the prophecy of Maggy the Frog come to fruition.   

**-Tyrells on the Small Concil** 

Even though he thwarted their attempt to marry Sansa Stark into their House, the hand of the King Tywin Lannister knew it was smart to keep house Tyrell happy, and as a powerful ally. Thus several key positions on the Small Council were awarded to House Tyrell and to Tyrell bannermen after the battle of Blackwater. Tywin names Lord Mace Tyrell as Master of Ships, Praxter Redwyne (A Bannerman of House Tyrell) as an advisor, and after Tryion is arrested for the Murder of Joffrey Baratheon, Mace Tyrell's own uncle, Garth Tryell (known as Garth the Gross) is called upon to fulfill the post of Master of Coin.. 

However when Tywin Lannister dies and Cersei assumes regency she insults House Tyrell by denying them several important council seats.  First she denies Lord Mace's wish to become Hand of the King, by first trying to appoint her Brother Jaime Lannister, who refuses the post, as well as her uncle Kevan, who also refuses due to being denied his request for regency and Cersei returning to Casterly Rock.  In the end Cersei names a weak and manipulatable Lannister Bannerman Harys Swift as Hand of the King.  Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannerman Praxter Redwyne are dismissed of their existing positions when they are tasked by Cersei to retake the lightly defended Storms End, and Dragonstone respectively from what remains of Stannis' garrison there, and are replaced by those loyal to Cersei.  Cersei also insults house Tyrell by denying the post of Master of Coin to Garth Tyrell, by instead naming an old and sickly Gyles Rosby to the post.   All and all Cersei moved fast by making sure the Tyrells had as least power as they could on the small council, but in doing so she weakens the realm by making poor appointments to these important offices.  

It is also worth a small note that Cersei changed the titles of the posts of the small council; not wishing the posts to be known as ""Masters of _______"" believing the term ""Master"" being overly prestigious for the offices she changes titles such as ""Master of Coin"" to ""Lord Treasurer"" and ""Master of Ships"" to ""Grand Admiral"".. One more of the rash decisions Cersei makes while in power.. 


**- The Maidenhead of Margaery Tyrell and the spies of Cersei**

One of the Biggest issues among Cersei and those in Kings Landing is the status of Margery's virginity in the books, in part of her betrothal to Joffrey it is insisted by Margaery as well as the rest of her family that her marriage to Renly Baratheon was never consummated, which is true.  And due to the extremely short marriage she had with Joffrey, neither was that relationship.  However it is noted that prior to her marriage to Joffrey that Margarey does not have her maidenhead intact, this offers Cersei nothing one way or the other due to the reality that even she admits that most women lose their maidenhead to horseback riding..Still Maragery being a virgin is a very important plot point in the novels and one that Cersei wishes to disprove not only to depose Maragery and Tommen's marriage, as well as her family's influence at court, but to avoid the fruition of that prophecy she was given all those years ago. To do this Cersei plants a spy among the women surrounding Margaery Tyrell, this woman is a Taena Merryweather.   Cersei wishes to gain intel on Margaery via Taena to see if she is as chaste as she claims, and while no information of Margarey's virginity can be assessed by Taena it is learned that one of Cersei's handmaidens is acting as a spy for Margaery... Cersei has this woman handed over to Qyburn for purposes unknown.  Having no way to discredit Maragery Cersei decides to take matters into her own hands and attempt to frame Margaery for infidelity using some of her personal favorite cronies.

I haven't even read this far into the books yet, but it's terrible.

Everything from Ellaria vowing revenge on Oberyn despite it being a fair and legal fight that Oberyn chose to partake in, to Obara's cliche introductory monologue of 'This is my backstory and this is my motivation'. Do they seriously need to spell out her life story? Could they not have shown it through subtler hints?

Then there's the pacing. Oh God the pacing.

We see the Sandsnakes once. The second time we see them they're already preparing to attack with absolutely no battle plan. They know their King will be watching the courtyard, but they were just going to run up and kill/kidnap Myrcella? In broad daylight?

And Bronn and Jaime seemed a fair while away from Dorne in Bronn's singing scene, but practically the next shot was them wildly running up to Myrcella and expecting her to come with them? Again, zero tactics. Jaime is a veteran tactician, and Bronn too. How did they think it was a good idea to show Jaime's face at all?

A better plan would have been Bronn waltz up to Myrcella and Trystane, say that lord Doran sent for her, and take her to Jaime, who could then explain the situation (not that I think Myrcella would willingly leave with Jaime, but it's a better plan than run and grab).

Then arguably one of the best parts of Dorne in Game of Thrones is just utterly ruined. We've seen Oberyn in combat and we know him to be (possibly) the most skilled fighter in the world. It's hinted that his daughters take after him in this regard, but when it comes to it they seem clumsy and don't attack when they have an opening. It was ridiculous.

Then Areo runs in with a full guard, as if he knew this would happen, and they all stop. Obara, once again, gives a pompous bit of dialogue explaining who she is, to a man she very likely knows.

Once the Sandsnakes are dealt with, Areo does a flashy swing of his axe to show off to the camera as 'Look at me, I'm the cool axe guy woohoo i'm badass'. It just felt forced, cheesy and utterly cliche.

Now, a lot of people are calling for a recast of the Sandsnakes, but it is not at all their fault. Their acting is sound, but their writing is poor. They've not been given any character build up (besides Obara's retarded speech) so they fail when shown in an intense scene. Not only that, but it doesn't seem they've been given the same stage combat training EVERY other fighting character received. Hell, Pedro Pascal had to LEARN Wushu for one single scene. It's very likely we'll be seeing more combat from the Sandsnakes, so why not give them proper training like they did Oberyn? Stupid stupid stupid

All in all, I feel very let down by the show from this plot, and I don't know how this can be rectified.",167,290,False,self,,,,,

When the Tyrells first come into play Margery is married to Renly Baratheon, but Stannis is rightful heir to the throne once the secret of the Lannister's incest is discovered. Why would the Tyrells seek to go to war with Stannis? If they want the throne, would it not be a better course to support Stannis, have him take the throne, and then kill him off after he has become king, therefore giving Renly legitimate claim to the throne?

If you also consider the Starks fight against the Lannisters would it not have been easier to allow Stannis to ally with the northern houses and defeat the Lannisters, with the Tyrells backing them financially. You would also have to assume if there was such an alliance the Arryns would side with them as well based on their shared history.

It just seems to me the smarter move is to get a true Baratheon back on the throne and then take him out, since Stannis only has a daughter, no real heir to the throne. Granted, this doesn't make for as exciting a story but it seems it would have been a more logical course for the Tyrells if their ultimate goal is to get the throne.

They discussed how Missouri senator Claire McCaskill is no longer watching the show because of the ""gratuitous"" rape.  One of the guests implied that the show-runners have an obsession with showing rape.  She gave the example of Daenerys being raped by Khal Drogo, of Cersei being raped by Jaime, and of Sansa being raped by Ramsey. She implied that none of those rapes happened in the books. (That's debatable for Khal Drogo, debatable for Jaime, and definitely not true for Ramsey; in fact, Ramsey's actions are far worse in the books.) The anchor then asked if the rapes had in fact happened in the books, would they be okay to depict on the show? The guest was momentarily speechless.

At another moment, the guest said that rape should be depicted in a ""respectful manner"" and not merely to ""advance the plot of a character"".  What does this even mean?  Did anyone -- *anyone* -- come away from the Sansa scene thinking that rape had been glorified or made light of? Quite the opposite; I think everyone saw how ugly it was and probably wanted Theon or Sansa to kill Ramsey right there.

I just think this uproar is missing the point. In the world Game of Thrones is depicting, terrible things happen all the time. The strong take from the weak. Innocent people are maimed, robbed, raped, enslaved, and killed every day -- just like in real life. The show isn't condoning those things.

I don't see why people don't see the obvious reasons for this scene to occur.


I believe Sansa was about to have sex with Ramsey willingly (albeit begrudgingly) up and to the point he told Theon to stay. She wasn't okay with that and then it became rape. She agreed to marry Ramsay knowing full well that consummation follows weddings almost immediately or even during the festivities.  She was betrothed to Joffrey and already married to Tyrion.  The only reason she was still a virgin is that Tyrion knew the suffering she had already endured and didn't want to add to it by forcing himself on her.  With full knowledge of this she agreed to marry Ramsay for the purpose of putting into motion a long term manipulation plan that Littlefinger suggested  to her- to ""make the boy yours"" and control Ramsay- in an effort to get revenge on the Boltons for betraying her family. She didn't know what Ramsay truly is when she agreed to this though. I don't think she or Littlefinger knew Ramsay's true nature, and if he had Littlefinger wouldn't have put her in that dangerous of a situation at this time.  As much as he wants to be Warden of the North he still cares about Sansa and wouldn't endanger her like that. 


So in this light the following ""rape"" served three purposes for the different characters:


1. For Ramsay- he uses this opportunity to further psychologically dominate Reek by fucking who is essentially his sister in front of him.  I think the show has done a poor job of reminding us what Ramsay did to Theon to make him Reek. Theon had is very identity stolen, was castrated, flayed, tortured deeply psychologically over months, and I wouldn't put it past Ramsey to have him raped; and Ramsay daily continues this torture and domination in various way. This is one of them.  Additionally he sees this as an opportunity to start (or attempt to) the physical and psychological domination of Sansa by raping her in front of someone she's known all her life and who she believes killed her brothers on what is her wedding night.  Ramsay sees this as a two birds, one bone. 


2. For Sansa- she now realizes that Ramsey is terrible and sees the type of situation shes gotten herself in to/fighting against. Myranda tried to tell her while she was washing her hair, but Sansa shot that down as Myranda trying to scare her because she is in love with Ramsay and jealous. Up to this point Ramsay has been behaving around Sansa for the most part and not being his terrible normal self except for small things like making Reek apologize to Sansa at dinner and making him walk her down the aisle. She thought it would be simple to continue the game Littlefinger was playing to get her revenge-  to manipulate Ramsay once they were married into doing what she wanted- but she now sees that this game isn't so simple and failure can have devastating consequences.  It may in fact be more difficult to make this boy hers and maybe even impossible to manipulate him. However she doesn't have to let this rape define her, or break her.  That brings us to the title of the episode: Unbowed, Unbent, **Unbroken**. Sansa will not let this event break her or her resolve to get revenge for her family.  She will refuse to allow Ramsay to control or manipulate her. 


3. For Reek- The event starts a redemption arc for Theon/Reek in which Ramsay starts to lose psychological power over Reek and Theon begins to reemerge.  Ramsay's attempt to control Reek here backfires and brings Theon back, he confesses to Sansa that he didnt kill her bros for real, and starts to help her plot against Ramsay and the Boltons to get her and his revenge.

Im writing this because I feel that D&amp;D wasted an awesome opportunity to further the growth of 2 characters. Ill explain my thinking for some of these changes after the scene.

We pick things up right at the point where Ramsey has told Sansa to disrobe and has instructed Reek to stay and watch.

Sansa and Reek make eye contact. Sansas face turns from shock to hardened, as she turns away from Ramsey and Reek to begin undoing the laces on her sleeve. We see the glimmer of a dagger in her sleeve as the camera jumps behind Ramsey as he rips open the back of Sansas dress. Sansa rapidly spins around to face Ramsey, and lunges at his chest with the dagger in hand. Ramsey face is coiled in rage as he stumbles backwards. The blade slashes across his chest, but the lunge leaves Sansa off balance. Ramsey grabs Sansa by the wrist and violently shakes the dagger from her hand. He rushes her into a wall as his snarl turns into a smile.

RAMSEY:  I like my bitches to play rough

Ramsey drags Sansa back to the pile of skins and forces her over them. We focus on Reeks face, still trembling in terror, his gaze towards the fight. We hear the sound of more clothes being ripped and angry grunts of Sansa as she struggles to keep Ramsey off of her. The camera comes back to focus on Ramseys top half as he struggles to keep Sansa in place and to undo his pants. We continue to hear Sansa struggle angrily as a belt hits for floor. In the background, we see Reek bend down, as if to pick something up off the floor. He rises again with his head down at whats is in his hand. 

REEK: [whisper] No.

The focus changes to Reek with a dagger in his hand, as the blurred outline of Ramsey begins thrusting.

REEK: [Louder] No.

Ramsey stops and we see him slowly turn towards Reek.

Ramsey: I cant have heard you say that Reek.

We see Ramseys eyes track down to the dagger in Theons hand.

Ramsey: Poor poor Reek. Dont do anything stupid now Reek.


Credits.

I dont love the end line for Theon, so please offer some suggestions. I really thought it was important to show that Sansa is now able to read situations better and isnt living in a fantasy world anymore with happy endings. Having seen enough shit, she knew to be ready for anything, especially after hearing from Miranda about Ramseys history. Also, this scene gives Sansa more ownership in her story. Yes she still gets raped, but she doesnt just accept it.

This is where Reek/Theon becomes important. He cant stand up to Ramsey on his own, so Sansas fight gives him the nudge he needs. Its also a call back to when Ramsey gave Reek the blade to shave him, and Reek just obliged. This episode should have ended with a more clear idea of the direction we are headed in with these characters. 

Once again this is just how Im choosing to remember things. You all can do whatever you want.

TL;DR Sansa has a knife. Cuts Ramsey. Ramsey overwhelms her and begins rape. Theon grabs knife and begins to stand up to Ramsey. End Scene.

I'm just curious as to what Reddit's opinion is on this.


So if you aren't privy to the controversy I'm talking about some how, its the rape at the end of the episode.

Alright so the biggest argument is that the rape provided nothing to the progression of characters. But I think people are over looking something very important: Sansa's trust in Littlefinger. She has just been getting beaten over and over again and has been constantly relying on others to get her out of it. Now she is in a position where she has no one to rely on (except that random lady who told her to put the light in the tower, but how trustworthy is that) and she NEEDS to find a way out asap. Also what else did you expect to happen to consummate a marriage with Sansa and Ramsey..

The other thing people are saying, is they should have shot it in a different way (whether they fade to black, or close the door and leave the room or whatever. I'm not a writer). Though I'll say I have not been that disturbed watching a TV show in my life and that includes Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, True Detective and more I just can't think of any right now. The sounds she made were chilling (props Sophie Turner). People keep saying they focused too much on Theon during the scene. But they had emphasis for as long as they could on Sansa, then switched to Theon when they couldn't show her anymore.

Also I think it was important to see Theon's face during that scene. I was under the impression he had lost all sense of himself through Ramsey's torture. I believed he had no memory of his former self and this scene showed he remembers her. He cared for her and his reaction shows he still does.

Well thats the end of my novel.


TL;DR Sansa is at rock bottom and can no longer wait for Littlefinger/anyone else to help, Theon is on the recovery (maybe not rock bottom, he did get his dick cut off) and is remembering his past. The scene was still incredibly fucked up, but I believe it to be necessary.

Since the show seems to be merging book arcs together, here's my theory on how the storyline from Winterfell and the Wall will play out, bringing characters into their current book roles.


Theon will help Sansa escape (this one seems pretty obvious), however I believe Brienne and Pod will also be involved in the escape. They will all head to the wall, only to be captured by Stannis.
Stannis will sentence Brienne, Pod and Theon to death, probably by burning them alive. Sansa will beg mercy for Brienne and Pod because she will now believe Brienne's vow to serve her. Sansa may or may not beg for Theon's life (probably still hasn't forgiven him) she will however ask that Stannis behead him rather than burn him alive, as is the Stark way. Whether or not he actually dies is debatable but my guess is that he will since it will appease the Northern lords.

Brienne feeling responsible for Sansa's suffering will be torn between her oath to avenge Renly and her oath to Catelyn Stark but will be persuaded by Sansa to kill Jamie Lannister since Brienne's hand in his escape ultimately led to the Red Wedding. 

Theon will confess to either Sansa or Stannis that the Stark boys are not actually dead. Stannis will use this information to send Davos (who is probably meddling in Stannis' plan to use Melissandre in this battle) on a mission to a nearby Northern city (not sure where), to find the whereabouts of Rickon or Bran with the promise that he will allow them to reclaim their seat at Winterfell once the Bolton's are defeated.

As for Jon after helping the Wildlings (which will already have displeased many of the Night's Watch) will return to Castle Black at which point Samwell will break the news of Sansa and Ramsey's wedding. This will send Jon over the edge and he will attempt to leave the Wall and join Stannis (possibly convincing the Wildlings to fight with him). Shortly after he leaves the infamous ""for the Watch"" scene will play out, possibly as an episode 10 cliffhanger.",10,3,False,self,,,,,

As is our community's motto, if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention. But honestly, at this point in the season it seems that at least one victory is on the rise. There's been too much foreshadowing and build up in the North with the Great Northern Conspiracy and Stannis riding on Winterfell for the Boltons to completely win the battle and have things stay basically the same as they were before the season started. With Tywin dead, the Boltons have no alliance with the crown and thus a very limited range of options for staving off Stannis and some relatively powerful pissed-off Northerners. Brienne and Podrick are also very close to Sansa as well, so it seems that she will somehow survive the season. It's the same for King's Landing, there's been too much buildup with Cersei making terrible policy decisions every which way for her tomfoolery with the Faith Militant and her constant burning of important bridges to not blow up in her face. To me, at least, it seems like it would take a lot of contrived and flawed writing for the Boltons or Cersei to find success towards the end of this season. That's not to say none of our favorites won't die, just that it wouldn't be good writing. Essentially, it would do nothing for the story as we'd remain exactly where the season began, which has never so far been the case when talking about differences between seasons. And Game of Thrones is never poorly written ^haha^right^guys  

tl;dr: The Dorne storyline was a one-time writing failure and it wouldn't make a great deal of logical sense for the season to end with Bolton and Lannister victories. The shock factor of ""nobody good or honorable wins"" writing has been done before, and I don't think that's how it'll end.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

The fight lacked any kind of suspense and believability. The whip girl was as affective as I would have been if I had used a spinning rope. The dagger girl looked like she held daggers for the first time. By all rights those two should have been dead in a few strokes yet Bronn conveniently always aimed for the position of the daggers (just look at the one .gif swirling around). Maybe just use your 1 meter sword leverage next time? In comparison the other bout was somewhat ok. Maybe Jamie should have had more problems. The result that only one little scratch came from that fight was just ridiculous. And as I understood it they had no qualms about killing anyone. Why not start the ambush by actually spearing someone from behind and not use the whip for show. Maybe she can only hit buried heads or only throw the spear with prior monologue and that would have killed the suprise? How did they ninja themselves there without anyone hearing anything anyway?

They've had it with all the sexual violence towards women without giving it the weight that it deserve. It's a very legitimate reason and if people want stop watching the show that's totally fine. Personally, I'm holding out judgement on Sansa's rape and what it means for her character and the show until I see some actual developments if any occur, but I'm digressing.


What's gotten me curious is the numbers that people throw out about the amount of rape the show depicts, and how each instance is handled. I got into an argument with someone who kept throwing out 9+ instances IN SHOW, while by my count I have something closer to 4, maybe 5. I've tried looking it up and everything keeps directing me to news outlets expressing outrage over the most recent one with redirects to the ""was it, wasn't it"" from last season, but no one can seem to give me an actual number of instances with the episodes and how the plot lines played out.


So I suppose my question is this, just how many instances of rape in the show can you think of/support? How did they play out? Was the rape glossed over and given no weight? Was it given weight, but mostly to portray a male character as evil? Was the rape victim anything more than a victim, or did they grow from it into someone interesting? Do you think that rape is a cheap ploy, or is it good writting?And I'm not talking about mentions of rape here, so no he said/ she said or unreliable narrators  to muddy the water, we need to see it happen on screen for it to count. And to clarify, on screen meaning we see/ hear it happening just out frame/it is shown as having had happen (think character bruised, stoic, while another character is getting dressed). Otherwise we'd be here all day, half the ""bad"" characters just casually mention someone being raped either by them or someone they know.

What absolutely baffles me the most is that so many people seem to think that it served no narrative purpose. In my opinion, the only reason people are saying that is because it was rape. If it was any other violent or criminal act between Sansa and Ramsey no one would give a shit.

And it had a narrative purpose. It was in some ways a role reversal for Sansa. We saw her really growing and coming up in her own way these past few episodes. That was punctuated by the moment she stands up to Myranda. Now when faced with a devastating and cruel man like Ramsey she is no longer in charge of this moment and Ramsey commits this horrible act against her.

-  -  -  -  -  -

Id like to thank everyone who took time out of their day to respond to the survey. I know there were a few questions and concerns about the methodology, so Im going to address those now.

When I first put the survey up, some people mentioned that it wasnt clear how they should rate a character like Theon. On one hand, hes a scumbag who led to the destruction of Winterfell, but on the other hand, hes pretty tragic and can be interesting to watch. Although you might not want to have a beer with him, youre entertained by his scenes. Eventually I clarified in the survey, noting that for characters like that (i.e. characters you love to hate) you should indicate that you like them.

But what about all the responses that were made before that clarification was put in place? I ultimately didnt think it would matter that much, and it looks like I was right for the most part  for 19 of the 20 character and actor questions, the difference in average score between people who took the survey with and without the clarification was found not to be statistically significant (=.05). That is, the clarification didnt cause the average scores to significantly change for most of the questions. The only question the clarification appeared to have an effect on was how much people like Petyr Littlefinger Baelish. The strange thing is, with the clarification, people rated him lower (even though the clarification should only ever cause people to improve their rating of certain characters). I think that this ultimately indicates that the difference in scores on this particular question was due to noise in the data or some other variable  perhaps more hardcore GoT fans noticed the survey earlier, while people who care about the show and characters less only noticed the survey a few days later when the clarification was already there.

I also saw a lot of comments questioning my character choices for the survey. There were a few reasons I chose the characters I did, but the primary one was that I wanted to examine the relationship between a characters popularity and how high the respective actor is rated. I think some of the shows actors, like Emilia Clarke and Sibel Kekilli are perceived to be worse than their peers simply because they play poorly written and sometimes unlikable characters. Likewise, I think that Stephen Dillane receives a lot of acting credit in certain communities just because he plays a character that appeals to hardcore Game of Thrones fans. Including these characters allowed me to look at the correlation between popularity and perceived acting ability more in-depth.

Besides that and the attempt to primarily feature characters that were introduced early, the limiting factor for who I could include on the survey was size. I didnt want to include a ton of characters, since if the survey was overwhelmingly large, I wouldnt receive the response rates I was shooting for. I would have loved to include Jaime, Cersei, Brienne, Margaery, Varys, and many more, but including tons of characters was never a priority. I do plan to do a more rigorous, more comprehensive survey at the end of the season depending on how well-received these results are though, and if that ends up happening, Ill make sure to include more characters.

One final thing to keep in mind before I get to the charts, tables, and data: this is not an academic study. I do not expect these findings to be picked up by a research publication, and Im by no means a professional at this sort of thing. So take the findings with a grain of salt. I just this on my own free time since I was curious about the results and thought it might be interesting. I hope you do as well.

For the sake of transparency, and in case anyone is interested, I've uploaded the survey data [here.](http://dropcanvas.com/kqjtg)",2,11,False,self,,,,,

Lightbringer is fictitious, in-universe.  It never existed.  The whole story is bogus, a tall tale spun over literally thousands of years.  There was never a single magical fiery sword to slay evil.  Instead, the tale of Lightbringer originated in the use of obsidian blades to combat the Walkers.  If you take the tale of its forging with a bit of creative license, the sword breaks multiple times and AA keeps recreating it -- an obsidian blade would, being extremely brittle, break often.

The story's just a bard's tale that began as folks talking about their obsidian weapons.  There was no single hero, no one single sword.  Just soldiers wielding dragonglass.",3,8,False,self,,,,,

1. Ellaria and the Sand Snakes - They're more Keystone Cops than the Bad Bitches What Were Promised. Sort of like an inept version of the Ninja Turtles (every one has got their own weapon: dual-wield daggers, spear, Indy whip) who don't particularly fight all that well. Plus, they've totally wasted Indira Varma as a one-dimensional female with a confusing accent.

2. Doran Martell - Dr. Bashir SHOULD be gaming at least as hard and effectively as Lady Olenna and Tywin Lannister. Thus far, his mascara has played a better game than the character.

3. Areo Hotah - This dude literally splits Arys Oakheart, a sworn brother of the m'fing Kingsguard, in twain with his total BadAxery. On the show, he poses a lot and spits one-liners at cripples.

This is possibly the only storyline (kinda looking at you too, Bran+Children) that has disappointed me in the show so far. At this point, I'm ready to completely write TV Dorne off as a lost cause in major need of a reboot. What say you all?",15,16,False,self,,,,,

House Tyrell formed an alliance with Stannis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/36lbnl/s5e6_speculationwouldnt_it_be_cool_if_house/,RatCoward,1432101335,"Ok so I haven't read the books, but from my perspective after watching up to S5E6, I want to see a Tyrell/Stannis alliance against the Lannisters.  This would be in both of their interests.

1) The Tyrells (i.e. Olenna) are not going to take Cersei's crap laying down, and they've previously demonstrated their willingness to [resort to regicide] (https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/joffrey-dead.jpg?w=882) when necessary.  Furthermore, Cersei is increasingly proving to be an erratic and even incompetent leader.  Love him or hate him, Tywin knew how to hold things together, Cersei does not. 

2) The Mannis needs all the allies he can get after losing most of his army in the [failed assault on King's Landing](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150328212702/gameofthrones/images/4/41/Wildfire_explosion.jpg). Sure, he has help from the Iron Bank, but I would think he's going to need more than outside funding, he needs a major Westerosi house backing him if he seriously expects to unite The Seven Kingdoms (or even just a few of them) under his rule.

To anticipate some objections, I realize that the Tyrells previously sided with Renly and this might complicate things a bit.  However, I believe (and correct me if I'm wrong) there is some precedent for Renly supporters rallying to Stannis after the younger brother was slain, especially considering the unclear details surrounding Renly's murder.  Thus it's not unthinkable that the Tyrells would overlook their past differences in favor of a more rational actor and stable ally.

Then there's the difference of religion issue, but I actually don't think this'll be a huge problem.  As the Lannisters (i.e. Cersei) have aligned themselves with the fundamentalist ""Spanish Inquisition"" wing of the Faith of the Seven, and if the Tyrells are planning to get back at Cersei, (and I think they are) they'll want revenge on the Faith Militant as well.  Which would put moderates among the Faith, as well as adherents of other religions, (ahem, The Lord of Light. Or even The Old Gods of the North) firmly in their camp.  They could play the ""standing up against religious persecution"" card.  What better family to lead this charge than the famously tolerant (at least of ""alternative lifestyles"") Tyrell house?  I know, I know, Melisandre is crazy and might not compromise, but honestly she seems willing to do anything if it helps her ultimate end of getting Stannis on the Iron Throne.  The Faith Militant on the other hand?  Not so much.

TL;DR: Stannis needs resources. Gold, food, armies, support, etc.  The Tyrells want to gain influence by attaching themselves to a powerful ruler (who's not actively undermining them).  Why aren't they working together?!",15,10,False,self,,,,,

Even without the last scene I was wondering whether the show is past its peak -- after all, we are now watching a story written by just TV writers, not GRRM. Fan fiction, if you may, of course fan fiction with insider knowledge but still.

So much of Arya's story is cut but you needed to include just how many cadavers being washed carefully and slowly? Blargh!

The Dornish Garden fight scene was *pathetic* , bad choreography (Tyene Sand...), horrible lines. I remember Syrio fighting and re-watched it countless times. Can you imagine watching this scene again? 

And for that infamous rape scene, when rape adds to the story, a character arc then it can be justified -- but there's no point here, we already know Ramsey is a horrible person, Theon was tortured badly etc. 

No, I am done watching this. Feel free to downvote but this is truth.

I think they have been early to judge it, but I think many of them make fair points.

I found this post in /r/asoiaf and I think it summarises why people are upset, I've bolded the most relevant paragraph.

&gt;What matters with the final scene is how it affects Sansa going forward.

&gt;If she stops being a victim and starts taking control of her situation then we know that she's developing and that D&amp;D do understand the character. Just because someone has been raped doesn't mean they have to remain a victim forever. D&amp;D have the chance to show that Sansa is strong enough to come through that and pick herself back up.

&gt;The old Sansa would've stayed a victim, but we could be seeing a new Sansa. Rape victims are generally portrayed in the media as nothing more than victims, butGoThas the chance to show that Sansa is still a rounded character who just happened to have gone through rape, rather than a character defined by rape.

&gt;**If her trauma is simply a catalyst for Theon's storyline and Sansa continues to remain a victim then I think D&amp;D have fundamentally missed the point of her character arc. Worse still, having Sansa go through that just to serve Theon's storyline is offensive to Sansa's character.**

&gt;Personally, I'm hopeful it's the former. There have been a few did storylines (Qarth in season two, Theon's torture in season three, Bran in season four, Dorne in season five) but on the whole I've been pleased with the adaptation and for the most part I think they get the story. They've made decisions I'm not happy about, but I'm optimistic that this won't be one of them.

&gt;tl;dr: I'm willing to wait and see how Sansa reacts to her trauma, whether she'll be defined by it and remain a victim or overcome it and start taking control.

 * House Frey([Banner is the twins](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140402112515/gameofthrones/images/8/8b/House-Frey-heraldry.jpg)): Their sigil is the twins. And there's bloody twice as much of them as any other house that's for sure.

 * House Mormont([Banner is a bear](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130405131650/gameofthrones/images/9/9f/House-Mormont-sigil.jpg)): Big, slow, resilient. Hard to take down but ferocious.

 * House Stark([Banner is a wolf](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140402121259/gameofthrones/images/7/72/House-Stark-heraldry.jpg)): Tough and fierce. Resilient in the cold and very hardy(I think we can agree the Starks have survived some awful things). Very concerned about their pack but also capable of going alone and being the lone wolf.

So as someone who is purely only a show watcher, I think it's been good. I'll admit that it is a very slow burner, but I also have a sense that they're building up to something big. It's been a very Stannis-centric season too, and I hope he destroys the Boltons.

Also, people are complaining that it's ""too slow."" Like, have you just skipped from the end of S1 until the beginning of S5 or something? The show has always been pretty slow paced. And I thought we were in an age where wanting faced paced action in television shows was sneered at? Plus, look at the other shows regarded to be GOAT tier. Breaking Bad's first two seasons were slow. The first half of each season of The Wire was always slow. Hell, most episodes of The Sopranos were slow. TV shows nowadays are all about rewarding the viewer's patience.

I found the rape scene horrifying but not contrived like everyone else seems to. It kind of suited Ramsay's character, and I'd like to think they're setting the bastard up for a massive fall.

I'm just sick of going on other forums and every GoT thread on there is full of complaints about how the show has been ruined, how it's past it, etc. If you feel that way, then why are you still watching?",30,7,False,self,,,,,

As a book-reader, I didn't find the scene shocking because I knew it was coming and frankly, because it just isn't that shocking. The main argument that apologetic folks gave is 'We already saw so much brutal shit in this show, this is nothing'. I'd say this is a false argument because you can't relativize traumatic experiences like that. However, the argument that really bothers is the one that most opponents gave as a response to that, and that is 'It isn't that we haven't seen more brutal things, it's that the scene goes completely against Sansa's character development'.

I mean, what the hell are you guys talking about? Are you assuming that Sansa's new-found confidence and learning to play the game somehow makes her immune to the evils of the world? Does her character development change the fact that Ramsay is a sadistic psychopath? Just because she is mentally stronger doesn't mean that shit can't still happen to her. I've personally known people who thought their life was movin' on up, and then something happens that throws them in a bigger gutter than they started of with. It happened the way it happened because *that's life* - bad things happen to people, regardless of how good or strong they are.

Furthermore, what the hell was Sansa supposed to do? Let's look at her options:

1. Let it happen - the option she went with. This will always be a scandalous opinion and encounter a lot of backlash from feminists, but 'letting it happen' is simply, by all logic, the most sensible thing a person can do when they find themselves already overpowered and about to get raped. All other options will probably result in more suffering for the victim. Again, this may be a shocking opinion to some, but that doesn't mean it's not true.

2. Resist - How well do you think Ramsay would take Sansa's resistance? It would probably just get him fired up and Sansa would finish the night lacking a few fingers, sleeping with the dogs *and* raped.

3. Try to kill him - Even if she succeeds, where does that leave her? Surrounded by thousands of Bolton men after killing Roose's only son and Lord of Winterfell? Not a good place to find yourself in. 

So in the end, if Sansa has truly learned to play the game, she would go with the 'let it happen' option. It's the only one that leaves her in a position to exact revenge on the Boltons, especially if Ramsay now believes her to be as weak as all the other women he tortured in his life. Yes, she has to endure an incredibly traumatic experience to get there, but again - *that's fucking life*.",19,12,False,self,,,,,

Spain gave them 1 week to enact absolutely everything, that is insane.

That means 1 week to film 6-7 episodes (not all 10 have dorne) of intense dialogue and action. I don't think people understand how much time it takes to film even a single scene. You have to get actors in costume, rehearse lines, get cameras set up, get equipment set up, shoot the scene, and reshoot what didn't work. 

I'm actually amazed it looks as good as it does with such a short time frame. If someone fucks up, they didn't have time to go back and fix it. So, if an actor/actress doesn't quite get the line right, you don't have time to say, ""That was horrible, let's do it again"".

Think of your favorite director. Is it Jackie Chan? Steven Spielberg? Rian Johnson? Orson Wells? Maybe even Michael Bay? Guess what, all of those guys had A LOT of time to film their movies. They have as much time as they need, as their studio respects their process (except maybe US's treatment of Jackie films, but that's another rant).

You know The Shining? Remember that scene where Jack is creeping up the stairs at his wife? That was over 100 TAKES. It took them all day just to film that scene, and the actors were exhausted at the end. Stanley Kubrick was very adamant about making sure every scene was perfect. And guess why he could do that? He had time.

So, I agree, Dorne has been a little lackluster this season. You know what would have made it better?

1. If Spain wasn't so concerned about losing a tourist location to film a fantastic show that would've gotten them additional revenue. Wouldn't you want to check out the place they shot that scene if it was done well?

2. If the Producers hadn't selected such a private location for Dorne scenes. I mean, no one's ever seen Dorne, you didn't have to pick Spain just because Pascal had that accent. Maybe he's just the weird guy who talks like that? It's not like we're going to crucify you for staying completely true to the book, we haven't yet, why should that be the last straw?

We all agree that fight scene this week was awfully choreographed. I know at least Obara trained for weeks to get her movements correct..but she's still just an actress, not a stuntwoman. The only real character who's decent with a weapon is Kit Harrington, and he's had 5 years of sword training. Sure, they could have gotten a better stunt team, but they really didn't have time to continuously switch out actresses with stuntwomen and still finish filming by day's end.

I agree, Dorne kind of blows right now, but it isn't D&amp;D's fault (entirely). We can all see that literally every other arc is still done very well, except maybe Meeran, but that's just as slow in the books right now. Sansa, Tyrion, Littlefinger, Olenna, Brienne, Jon and Stannis have been on the top of their game this season. I'll admit, I'm a fanboy of the series, but I'm just...tired of people ripping Dorne apart. Aren't you tired?

So the question is, where does Sansa's story take her from here? Obviously there are those who think that her development has taken a huge step backwards, I'm not one of them. D&amp;D, love 'em or hate 'em, have so far done a fine job of transferring one of the most intricately detailed fantasy worlds ever created from print to screen. Sure S5 has had it's low points, but I trust them enough to continue delivering this amazing story.
So, back to the thread title...
As I said before, I don't believe her character development has taken a backward step, which in my mind any wway, leaves us with only 2 paths her story can take. 
Option 1. Despite the marital rape, Sansa is in the strongest position she has ever been in since episode 1. She has survived spending years alone in King's Landing, branded daughter of a traitor, at the mercy of a sadistic, psycho KING who could have her tortured and killed at any point with no repercussions whatsoever. We see the first inkling of the 'little bird' reciting the words expected of her when Joff shows her Nedhead. From that point forward Sansa has been playing the game to simply stay alive.I know you guys are fond of the happy ending quote. Personally I prefer 'When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die'. Sansa is very much not dead (yet, see option 2 for my thoughts on that.) Our girl has survived the deadliest place in all of Westeros, and learned much during her time there. Now she is back on familiar ground and she has more support around her than she could ever have hoped for in KL. We have the NR club, Brienne with her oath (and Pod) and the Mannis on his way to rough up the Boltons. The psycho she is karried to wants nothing more than to please his father. His father needs Sansa alive and relatively unharmed so I think she is pretty safe from the worst of the book horrors. Emphasis was put on Ramsay's 'furthering a dynasty' line, so even a pregnancy won't bore him because it's a Bolton baby.Let's not forget Littlefinger. No matter what he is up to, the important thing is Sansa truly believes that she has the sneakiest, cleverest man in Westeros on her side. That kind of belief can summon courage from the darkest of places. She made a decision to endure marital rape in order to avenge her family because she believes in LF. Her tears and screams will be heard throughout Winterfell (just like the books characters were) but instead of being genuine tears they are merely a tool to fool Ramsay into thinking he has the victim he needs to get off. One thing she learned to do very well in KL was cry...So Sansa remains strong, one of her rescuers helps her out, Ramsay gets whats coming to him, she takes control of WF (not sure if she will have a bolton baby or abort but thats irrelevant here)boom! everyone's happy. Or....
Option 2. Get your tinfoil ready.
Even the staunchest LSH fans are realising that the time has come and gone for her appearance. So many big show moments since the red wedding that any impact she would have had is severely diminished. Unless Sansa is killed once the Boltons beat back Stannis. Sansa is necessary to the Boltons to unite the Northmen against Stannis' army. What happens to her once she has served that purpose? She becomes boring...There have been several mentions of Cat so far this season...even framing a shot of Sansa at the broken tower in the same fashion as her mother, almost like they are teasing us. I propose that if the Boltons win, then Sansa may well be killed and discarded (especially if she is caught out during an escape attempt). The final shot of the season (from the books as per D&amp;D) will be Sansa Stoneheart, her eyes full of hate....",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Danny then runs into the pits and jumps on the Dragons back and rides him off to a little Island in the Dothraki sea where she is discovered by the new Dothraki Kahl. Meanwhile, back in Mereen, people think shes dead.

Is this not going to happen in the TV show? I keep reading about how shes going to invade Westeros. But, based on her book plotline, she seems to be heading back to the Dothraki. Do you think they will change this to keep her story moving forward towards a big war? Or will they stick to the script, so to speak.

I am not going to say good riddance either. I didn't take the time to write this to waste breath trying to justify the motives/actions of the creators or to insult you for making a choice I don't agree with or to engage in philosophical arguments about the proper way to depict rape in entertainment. I am fortunate to live in a (relatively) free country where the exploration of such topics is freely aloud, both in discussion and art, and in a time where the internet allows people to share an array of opinions. I respect that many of you have different opinions. I just want to cut through the endless parade of bullshit being defecated by some senators and fans on twitter, as well as the media. 


Let's be real, this show has always been gratuitous. If you are upset by last week's episode and have sworn the show off, I don't fault you or condemn you. This reaction has happened several times from several episodes throughout the years and I've gotten used to it. This show can be extremely upsetting, bordering on traumatizing. I just ask you to be honest with yourself about your motives for being upset, because this illogical and insincere form of indignant offense is, frankly, stupid. You knew what you were getting into when you started watching this show. The latest scene may have personally shocked and saddened and angered you, but please acknowledge that these are personal feelings and your tantrum is not a relevant social commentary about the state of entertainment. This latest rape scene is neither surprising nor unprecedented on the show. 


If you've actually been watching the show, instead of just claiming to for popularity points, then you have witnessed:


* [A brother strip and molest his sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6JQhTa0Yhs)


* [A violent orgy where men murder and disembowel each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0IhEYId-rQ)


* [A bride getting raped on her wedding night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrht8mroFM4) 


* [A sister watch her brother die as molten gold is poured over his head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbhv3JHkJNk)


* [A man try to kill a boy by pushing him out of a window, permanently crippling him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9I_eCCEl8k) 


* [A brother rape his sister next to the corpse of their child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yzxb9mhxzc)


* [A mother having her baby stripped from her and then screaming in horror as its throat is slit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZSumo95UO0)


* [A pregnant woman stabbed repeatedly in the stomach in front of her husband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXZ2mTVwaNs) 


* [A man tortured, his genitalia removed, and turned into a dehumanized slave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RvHEFCf-B8)


* [A man burned alive, with children watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj6m_WTh5mo )


* [A man decapitated, with his children watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MgjP_0iFm0)


* [A man's eyes gouged out and his head squeezed until it popped, as the mother of his children shrieks in horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03nqjy7FIBA)


* Many decapitations, [throat slittings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhk69sPZW-U), and brutal murders.



So if you've suddenly found the show to be intolerably offensive, I'd ask you to seriously examine why you've been watching it for half a decade. If these previous instances were acceptable to you as a form of entertainment but Sansa's rape scene is not, I would love to hear a (rational) explanation why. Because I, personally, am at a loss trying to understand. ",98,69,False,self,,,,,

So I guess my question is, do you guys think there was a significance in Arya lying to herself about how she felt about the Hound, and is it possible he'll make a return?",2,9,False,default,,,,,

While I think a lot of these arguments have a lot of validity, I have to say something in defence of this episode.

Of course I think that rape and sexual assault need to be handled delicately when portrayed anywhere, be it television, movies, books, or any other source of media. The argument is that because the show is now diverging so much from the plot of the books, the writers didnt need to include a rape scene featuring Sansa and Ramsay. We know Sansa is a victim of terrible, horrific circumstances. We know Ramsay is a bad guy. The scene doesnt provide any new information. And that is all true. 

Where it gets a little complicated for me, though, is that I do think this is a pretty important plot point. Were all too familiar with Ramsays monstrous side - weve seen what he did to Theon, as well as to previous women. The writers committed to a storyline in which Ramsay marries the real Sansa Stark, not a fake Arya Stark like in the books. And for a brief moment, it does actually seem like Ramsay might treat Sansa with an infinitesimally larger amount of respect and compassion than he treats, well, everyone else, except perhaps his father.  The writers chose to include a scene in which Ramsay, pretty earnestly, tells Petyr Baelish that he would never do anything to hurt Sansa (And at this point, I have to give props to actor Iwan Rheon for his portrayal of Ramsay - his ability to do all the horrible things that Ramsay does but still give him a tiny shred of humanity is pretty impressive). Weve seen how important becoming a legitimate Bolton is to Ramsay, and its not too much of a stretch that a marriage to a high-born lady who must be respected would also fit into Ramsays vision of his future. All of this to say that, to me, I think the fact that Ramsay ultimately treats Sansa the way that he does is important; it shows that despite his new sense of self as a noble heir to an important house, he still will not give up his monstrous tendencies. And for Sansa, it crushes any glimmer of hope she might have felt that perhaps she could have a life with her new husband. 

What it comes down to for me is this: after committing to the Ramsay-Sansa marriage storyline, is it really feasible that Ramsay wouldnt rape her? I understand that there are other ways to depict his power over and abusive treatment of Sansa, and I absolutely agree that the entire storyline is problematic. But in a series where murder, incest, sexual exploitation, and rape are all too familiar to viewers, I think its a little hypocritical to immediately condemn this particular scene. 

The scene was not meant to be entertaining. It was brutal. It was hard to watch. It made me feel sick. But wasnt that the point?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Pros:  Acting, Writing, Set Design, Pacing, Costumes
Cons:  Except for blowing the opportunity to say ""Edd, fetch me a block"", it's been nearly flawless, and that's even w/ Melisandre and Selyse there.

How 'bout that, Kit can actually act!  Or maybe the plotline makes his wounded expression more appropriate.  Regardless, there is great character development and consistency (Jon again showing his commitment to the Night's Watch and being one of the few focused on the bigger view/threat).  You have brilliant Jon &amp; Stannis interchanges where these powerful characters butt heads but obviously respect each other.  You have touching bonus scenes like Stannis declaring his love for Shireen.  You have drama &amp; confrontation w/ the beheading of Slynt.   This storyline has it all, really. Bonus points for every time Maester Aemon speaks.  

**Winterfell: A**

Pros: Acting, writing, costumes, set design, pacing
Cons: Brienne's storyline &amp; character choices

This may be D&amp;D's biggest success in the series so far, because they've greatly deviated from the source material in this storyline but it almost all works.  The high-tension dinner scene, the conversation in the crypts, Alfie Allen's acting...they've all been amazing.  The characters all have their believable motives.  Props to the designers and costumers for Sansa's wedding gown and the snow-fall wedding.  Well done.  The only downside is Brienne &amp; Pod's first scene.  Overall, Brienne can still be described as the honorable knight, so I'm not sure why she started the fight at the pub without intending to go back and actually rescue Sansa.  She's always avoided fights before then.  I did like her backstory speech w/ Pod though.  

**House of Black &amp; White: A-**

Pros: Acting, writing, set design
Cons: Pacing

By pacing I don't mean the storyline as a whole, I mean sometimes we often don't see Arya for two weeks (in real time) and it can be difficult to remember what happened last.  Maisie Williams is one of the greatest actors on the show.  When she can make a line like ""What?"" (""Wot?"") both believable and funny, you know what you're doing.  Captivating storyline.  People complain about how much time is spent on washing dead bodies, but we're supposed to feel and connect with Arya's impatience and confusion.  The interior of the house and the room w/ all the faces were spot on.

**Mereen: C+**

Pros: Dragon effects, pacing, costume design
Cons: Needless death of major character, Dany's flip-flopping, some say choreography

I didn't mention acting bc although Emilia Clarke has a habit to overact (especially w/ her eyebrows), I think she's improved this season.  So she's no longer distractingly bad.  The Sons of the Harpys, with their creepy gold masks, look fantastic.  Some don't like the Grey Worm and Missandei story - I'll wait to see where it goes.  I like Grey Worm's character so I'll be patient with that one.  The pacing has been excellent - every scene has consequence.  I hate how Dany went from saying no one's above the law in one episode, to feeding what may be an innocent man to her dragons.  Ser Barristan's death...where to start.  First, let me say I'm a firm believer that at least a few major characters should die at the hands of some no-names.  I also am a fan of the occasional surprise death for book readers.  I'm really only bummed because I loved the book fight between Barristan and Khrazz.  Knowing it won't happen makes me sad.

**Tyrion's Roadtrip: B-**

Pros:  Acting, special effects, pacing
Cons: Writing in the pirate scene, believability

Peter Dinklage and Ian Glen are awesome actors.  And seeing their characters slowly bond over history/poetry was a nice, believable touch.  The pacing is a strength bc although they're still traveling, Tyrion has gone from getting out of the crate, getting kidnapped in the brothel, through Valyria, and captured by slavers, in nearly that many scenes.  It's getting somewhere as fast as possible (unlike the books!).  The writing in the pirate scene w/ Mr. Eko, er, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, was unbelievably bad.  Also, the fact that Jorah ran into Tyrion in the first place, and that the pirates are going to the fighting pits (just re-opened!) was too much coincidence and not enough development. 

**King's Landing: C+**

Pros: the Queen of Thorns!
Cons: Writing, not enough development, too illogical on many fronts

The gaping hole in talent left by Charles Dance, Dinklage, and Aiden Gillen is felt in King's Landing.   Lena Heady is a great actor, but her decisions are bewildering.  I think they're rushing this storyline too much, and the changes from the book don't make sense.  Why accuse Loras instead of setting up Margaery for adultery?  Was that so the actor could get some screen time?  The religious fanatics are too over the top with the stars cut into their foreheads, and Tommen is too impotent.  They're dumbing down all the characters and their motivations in this whole storyline.  Diana Rigg is the only shining light in this thread. 

**Dorne:  F+**

Pros: the acting of Alexander Siddig, Jerome Flynn, and Deobia Operai, costume design
Cons: EVERYTHING else (the writing, set design, choreography, pacing, breast-plate nipples)

Ugh.  What a nightmare.  What is Bronn's motivation to risk his life for Jamie again, especially since he wouldn't for Tyrion?  Why are Oberyn's daughters killing a ship captain who volunteered information and trying to kill a child (I know WHY...but it's out of character)?  Why did Bronn and Jaime not have a plan better than kidnapping her in plain daylight, with a witness/lover by her side, almost literally under the balcony that Doran likes to look out from?  How unlikely is it that Jaime &amp; Bronn, the Sand Snakes, and Doran's guards all got there w/in 2 minutes of each other?  It was like a bad Scooby Doo episode.  And don't get me started on the fight choreography.  This plotline is so bad it's like it's from another show.  I actually want to see the Sand Snakes given a chance to correct this travesty.  Bc right now the writing and sets are so bad, I'm not sure Daniel Day Lewis could make one of these scenes worthwhile.  The ""+"" was for the acting of those 3 mentioned in the ""Pros"" but also Trystane and Myrcella held their own.  And the costumes all kicked ass, even w/ Trystane's pink robes (saved by the details!).

Margaery also sarcastically told Cersei, ""What can I expect? He is half lion, half stag."" Notice how she first refers to him as half lion. I'm pretty sure the High Sparrow believes the rumors to be true, but he isn't going to take action because Stannis is the last legitimate heir if the parentage of Tommen and Myrcella is challenged by the Faith.

It just seems too good to be true that Sansa actually has people on her side.

Besides which, who is going to come help her? Some peasants? Not exactly sure how that's going to help here when she's stuck in a castle with the two biggest monsters in the North, along with all of their household guards and soldiers. Brienne? The offer was made before she gets near Winterfell. So unless there's some friendly Northern knights hanging out in the crypts we haven't seen yet, It seems like a hollow offer.

Ultimately, it seems like it's supposed to be a test for Sansa; any call for help would be seen as disloyalty, and if there's anything Ramsey doesn't like, well... ",11,6,False,self,,,,,

The short version: I think all sides of this debate have valid points, and the scene can't be fully judged until we see what's next.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/36p9jo/s5_im_sure_there_have_been_plenty_of_opinions/,[deleted],1432170924,"So, I finally watched that Game Of Thrones episode last night after a couple days of following the controversy. I came away from it feeling like I can understand more than one perspective on this, and that ultimately we can't fully judge the decision until we see how it's followed up. To be much more specific:

Game Of Thrones has, from the beginning, been about contrasting the fabled version of medieval life we've seen in most fantasy with the true horrors of legitimate human history (while keeping the fantasy dragons etc). That's the entire basis of the thing. And so to cut against the usual fantasy of the princess in the tower by showing what actual princesses would have been subjected to in those towers, I don't think it's a betrayal of the storytelling. Nor do I think it's pointless: women were in reality treated monstrously in a period of history that people tend to romanticise.

And Game Of Thrones is all about power balances (and imbalances). And again and again it has given us truly great female characters who are aware of the way the cards are stacked against them but find their own ways, against the odds and despite having to suffer the inevitable horrors, to carve out a true existence and have their voices heard. Which brings me to Sansa: she knew from the moment she agreed to take part in this ploy that her wedding night with Ramsay would be something along these lines. She made that choice because she's playing a bigger game, and she's not passive. This is her home and, damnit, she'll take it back. A medieval wedding is going to bring this sort of misery for the bride - that much is inevitable. And Sansa didn't go into this naive. Not that that makes what happens any less terrible for her or the audience.

NOW - here's where the show undercuts itself:

It so often degrades it's strong (and feminist!) storytelling by inserting pornographic sequences that are only there to reach their quota of female nudity. This is bad enough (and just kind of awkward) under normal circumstances, but when you're going to be dealing with an issue like marital rape you need to be consistent in how you portray your female characters. If the show so often drops its standards for its women and portrays them as objects for the male gaze, it makes the rape of one of your main female characters feel particularly exploitative and gross.

Secondly, just because the event is somewhat inevitable doesn't mean you HAVE to do it without justifying it through plot. Because, let's be honest: we've seen Sansa survive horrors, to be used as an object, and we've seen her stand up for herself and take control of her decisions. She's been through quite enough to tell that story. And Ramsay? We know he's a monster. And we know Theon is a broken man struggling with many demons. So there's that uneasy feeling that nothing of narrative importance has been achieved through Sansa's rape, only an underlining of what we already know. And when sexual assault is so commonplace in the REAL world, you simply cannot thrust it upon one of your main characters without purpose.

And sexual assault CAN have a meaningful place in storytelling. Hell, Twin Peaks is one of my favourite things and it's entirely based around the repeated rape and eventual murder of a young woman. But there's a purpose to it. There's something being commented upon.

For the record, I don't believe the scene was more about Theon than Sansa as some have suggested. I was worried about that. I think the cut to Theon was more an attempt to suggest what is happening without graphically showing it. I think they were trying to be sensitive in their portrayal of what was happening, but they fucked up by creating a possible interpretation that would be frankly abhorrent if intended.

So, let's see. Let's see how they use this next. If it is, as some suggest, just another example of raping a character to give her an audience pleasing revenge (which she'd already earned without being raped) down the line, then it is (like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo before it) junk storytelling and every ounce of anger at the producers is justified.

So far, we've had a few different types of weddings in the show. The members of the ceremonies were all in different relationship stages.

Khal Drogo and Daenerys Targaryen - I think we can assume here that Drogo has boinked a lot of chicks throughout Essos and that Daenarys is a virgin.

Edmure Tulley and Roslin Frey - As far as I know, Edmure and Roslin were never betrothed or married to anyone else before their wedding. Pretty standard.What a fun night that was! Beautiful decorations.

Robb Stark and Talisa Maegyr - Neither one of them had been married. Robb was betrothed to someone else, a Frey, any Frey. He didn't give a shit. They got married in secret. Robb and his date looked stunning at his uncle' wedding afterwards.

Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark - Tyrion had been married before, but it was to a whore and a long time ago so whatever. Sansa had been betrothed to Joffrey Baratheron, but had never been married before. These two never consummated the marriage.

Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell - Joffrey had been betrothed to Sansa, but whatever. Margaery had been married to Renly Baratheon, but that marriage was never consummated because Renly was biting pillows. 

Lysa Tully/Arryn and Petyr Baelish - Lysa had been married before, and it was consummated, but her husband died. Somehow. Definitely wasn't her. There's proof with her 9 year old boobsucking son. Petyr, to my knowledge, had never been betrothed or married before, but I'm sure he had done some flesh fantasies in his day. 

Tommen Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell - Margaery had been married twice, neither were consummated, and both husbands died. Tommen haha yeah Tommen. 

Sansa Stark and Ramsay Bolton - Sansa is married to Tyrion, but it hasn't been consummated. Tyrion is still alive though. Ramsay had never been betrothed or married.


So we have all these different levels of previous marriages and engagements and different situations. I think it's pretty established that pretty much anything you can think of marriage-wise in Westeros can or will (or has) gone down. Including polygamy. 

Is the next wedding in the show the wedding between Rhaegar Targaryan (a currently married dude, wife still alive, consummated) and Lyanna Stark (betrothed to Robert Baratheon)? Either a flashback or just a mention of it by someone that ultimately confirms Jon Targaryen is gonna be riding some fucking dragons and shacking up with his sexy silver-haired cousin?

Tell me I'm not crazy.

Why people are dislike that ending scene.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/36pp2e/s5e6_enough_with_the_straw_men_why_people_are/,Leanchoilia,1432178363,"Just going the front page, a number of people who frequent this subreddit think that there is no good reason to criticize that rape scene. Not too surprisingly there have been a bunch of prominent straw man arguments getting torn down, so I'm going to offer my take on the **actual** arguments why it was a poor creative decision.    
***
###Why that scene was bad

One of the biggest reasons this is such a problem is that it seems pretty unnecessary. It doesn't tell us anything new about characters or setting; we know that Ramsay is a monster, we know that Reek is a broken man full of anguish, and Sansa's whole story until the end of S4 has been to be serially victimized by just about everyone she runs into. While we don't know exactly what the plot ramifications, if there are any, of this will be, I am fairly certain that whatever they end up being the showrunners/writers/directors could have found some other way to make the plot happen that way. They chose to include a rape specifically (over any other form of violence) and there's no indication that there is a good reason for that choice.

Face it, the show's track record with rape does not inspire confidence. In S1 Dany is raped repeatedly by Drogo, cries over it once, and then falls in love with him over the course of another couple episodes. The Jaime/Cersei scene in the sept also inspired a ton of controversy, but then it was revealed that it was supposed to come across as consensual. I have a hard time trusting anyone who thought that scene looked consensual to give an accurate and respectful treatment to actual rape. It also doesn't help that the show has a track record of routinely [including naked women to act as glorified props](http://boingboing.net/2015/05/12/the-naked-hypocrisy-of-game-of.html) (Note: I don't have a problem with including nudity or sexual content, but the silent naked background ladies and sexposition have always been unnecessary).

Another big problem with the scene from a creative point of view is that it's a weird hitch in Sansa's character arc. As I mentioned earlier, she's pretty much been a perpetual victim from the beginning. Since the end of S4 and for all of S5 up until that scene she has been reclaiming some agency, tiring of her role as a bystander and taking some action to get what she wants. The bath scene with her and Myranda earlier in S5E6 is ironically probably the best illustration of that we've seen so far. That's why it feels so jarring when she goes from ""This is my home and you can't frighten me"" to passively doing what she's told. There are so many ways that scene could have been written so that she could retain some of that agency we've seen her struggling to regain (seriously, what was the point of Littlefinger's line telling her to seduce Ramsay or Myranda's lines telling her that Ramsay gets bored?). Sansa obviously knew the marriage would be consummated, so everything seemed to be setting up Sansa at putting on a charade of interest in her relationship with Ramsay. In fact I think you can see evidence of that in Sophie Turner's acting in the wedding and afterwards until Ramsay asks Reek to stay. Why did the creators decide to make it play out this way? The only answer I can come up with is that Sansa being raped will provide a turning point for Theon to start reawakening. Hopefully it will have some effect on Sansa's story as well, but again, I don't see why it has to be rape specifically to provide these character motivations.

To make it clear, my ideal version of these stories would not exclude any and all mentions of sexual violence. As GRRM himself has pointed out repeatedly, Westeros is very patriarchal oppressive, history has shown that sexual violence is a common way that these power structures are reinforced. It would be very strange if there were no rape in Westeros. However, the story in both the books and the show is created by people and the events included need to serve that story. In this case particularly, I see the rape as counterproductive to the story.

* Bad-people that you feel sorry for; Among others, Cersei is an utter bitch &amp; Jaime is a prick but, at some stage, I've felt sorry for just about all the 'bad-people'........except Joffrey.

1. You haven't read all the books, and usually don't care about what is/or isn't in them unless it's something that you didn't enjoy. Bronn gets more screen time? Hooray! Tyrion keeps his nose? Awesome! Tywin and Ayra meet? Cool! Sansa is assaulted? IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE BOOKS IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. Just because it's changed, doesn't mean the writers are on heroin and doesn't mean it won't pay off later. Stop thinking every change is unnecessary. If it was, do you not think G.R.R.M would stamp it out quicksmart? He's told the writers of the show how it finishes entirely, do you not think that everything is planned out? For example the snakes might be shit now but is it not possible they'll become relevant/cool later? Every single character is different from the books just about, and have we not enjoyed all of them on-screen? 

2. You are only just getting used to having to wait one episode a week. I started Game of Thrones way late, and found my first season as it came out weekly a lot harder than when I could just watch it all at once. The payoff is a long way away, to anything this season. We still have 4 weeks until we (and I'm assuming here too) the Sandsnakes story actually goes somewhere, to Sansa actually getting revenge (along with Theon) and the Tyrells actually kicking ass. A reminder that at the start of the season everyone thought Baelish was a moron for aligning with the Boltons, and now it turns out he's lining them up for Stannis. And people right now are calling him stupid for lining up with Cersai, forgetting that he'll probably just turn around and betray her soon enough. (Maybe when a certain sparrow comes asking questions about her...) Just have patience. 

3. The Snakes, yes we get it they sucked. Now, name me some characters you liked right at the start. Ayra? Wait, we got annoyed at her. Sansa? Wait, we thought she was a fool. Jamie? Wait, we thought he was a psycho. Stannis? Wait, we thought he too was insane. Jon? Wait, we thought he was insipid. Stop thinking about how you feel now and remember to wait for the end of their story to see how well it paid off.

Really just stop getting annoyed cause you can get annoyed at anything if you try hard enough. If you're the kind of person who gets asked about say Breaking Bad and immediately go ""Yeah but that fly episode is so stupid"" you're the kind of person people hate discussing things with. You're forgetting all the awesome shit this season:

1. The Dragons

2. Old Valyria 

3. The North

The Andals were analogous to the French Normans, who brought their system of government, titles, and religion across the English Channel following the Norman Invasion in 1066. In GoT, this happened 6000 years ago. The Andals were from the Northwest of Essos, between Pentos and Braavos. 
http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/File:Free_Cities.png
In GoT, Andal influence was wide-ranging, and even modern Dothraki call Jorah Mormont ""The Andal"" despite the fact that he's an Old Gods-worshiping Northerner who descends mostly from the First Men. 

Now if we look at Europe today, we can see remnants of Norman culture. Norman is spoken in some small areas of Jersey and France. And of course, Norman culture heavily influenced both English and mainland European language and culture. 

From what we've seen of Northwest Essos (e.g. Braavos), there doesn't seem to be much Andal culture that remains. I think it would be great to be shown some pockets of Andal culture in Essos at some point. Perhaps some armored Essosi knights and bannermen. Remnants of the Faith of the Seven religion. Something. Just to show that the Andals had a lasting influence on Essos the same way that you can see how Normans influence much of the West to this day.",1,1,False,default,,,,,

""Oh NOW you're upset?"" No. People have been upset about the gratuitous rape and violence since the beginning and people have always been vocal about it. I think a lot of people are viewing Sansa's rape as the last straw.

I posted this as a comment elsewhere but I'm going to put it here because it's relevant and it took me a long time to write.

There are a lot of reasons why people are upset about the rape. It's true what happened in the book was worse than what happened in the show, but what happened in the book was terrible, disgusting, and horrifying. It's not exactly a good defense that the show was slightly less horrifying. Also, because the show is diverging from the book in so many ways, many of them major plot developments, it's reached the point where saying ""Well this happened in the book"" doesn't really hold ground. D&amp;D are making their own creative choices and they get to be held responsible for them now. They've already changed the plot significantly. They had the choice to not include this rape and they chose to include it.

A lot of the initial reaction to the scene is obviously visceral and emotional. People don't like it, they don't want to see it, so they object. Many people also feel like rape is becoming a go to plot device in Game of Thrones. At this point, three major female characters have been raped, and none of those rapes occurred in the books. They were included specifically for the show. Some people believe the show is including these rapes as a kind of catalyst for character development, as if overcoming rape is the only thing that can lead to female empowerment, and a lot of people have issues with rape being viewed as a mechanism of empowerment, for obvious reasons.

Also, people are worried that the rapes are included not as a means to any kind of character development but specifically for shock value or as some kind of ""torture porn."" Rape is very difficult to depict on screen and because it is a very realistic form of violence (remember 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted in their lives to say nothing of the many men who are sexually assaulted) and because everyone who experiences sexual assault responds to it differently, it is imperative that a show handle a plot line that includes rape with a great deal of nuance, with seriousness, and with a sincere effort to capture the healing process that the victim goes through. Game of Thrones has not handled that well in the past. The first rape of a major character was never talked about again, the victim fell in love with her rapist, and the rapist was portrayed as a cool character. The second rape of a major character was never talked about again, had no impact on the victim, and again the rapist is supposed to be a likable character. There is a lot of violence against women in Game of Thrones through all of the seasons and in general it's a bit callus. People are afraid that this rape will be another example of a traumatizing event that will not have any real consequences or be talked about in a serious way. Constantly showing rape without the serious discussion it deserves trivializes rape.

This particular rape was of an incredibly sympathetic and innocent character who spent the past several seasons barely escaping getting raped. She was also just developing some agency and becoming a player in this complex world. She was finally not a victim. And then the show took her and made her a victim. Again. It really cuts into her development as a character and it hurts the audience all the more for it. Some people feel that in the scene itself the focus was taken away from her and put it on the male victim, as if her pain was only significant because it hurt him. People are also afraid that this victimization of a female character is now going to be used not for her own development but for the development of a male character.

Some people feel that the rape was completely unnecessary. People have pointed out that Mad Max: Fury Road is a story about women rebelling against sex traffickers and they didn't feel the need to include a rape scene. While it is true that D&amp;D could have avoided including this rape, I understand why they did it for the narrative. This rape was the natural conclusion of that arranged marriage, and that arranged marriage streamlined the plot from the book significantly in a way that I would argue creates a more compelling story. Personally, since the victim would have anticipated consummating her marriage in some way, I find it upsetting that we never hear her thoughts about the event beforehand. Bryan Cogman, a producer of the show, said ""This is a hardened woman making a choice and she sees this as the way to get back her homeland."" I don't think that really came across in the show because the character never actually says what she thinks and I find it strange that they didn't include that. The rape scene, at least in my opinion, made it seem like she didn't know what she was in for and that she was once again a pawn and a victim.

There is some debate whether the audience needed to see it. After all, the scene gives us no new information about any of the characters involved. It's there to be upsetting. There is an argument that including the scene was a good creative choice because it depicted the rape with gravity, it forces the audience to really experience the horror of rape, and it could potentially create a great conversation about how our society treats women. If people are this upset about a fictional rape maybe it will inspire people to make efforts to stop real rape. However, it remains to be seen whether the show can follow through and produce a meaningful dialog on a serious issue like this. That, I think, is the main reason people are upset.

Sorry for the super long post. Hope it explains some things anyway.

TL;DR: People are sick of all the rape. Did it even do anything? Was it trivializing rape? It's really upsetting!",16,0,False,self,,,,,

I kept feeling like I wish I hadn't ever watched the show until I had read them all. I felt like I cheated myself out of major moments. I would see straight through every foreshadowing event, or conversation and know exactly what was coming. Every major moment in the book had already surprised me years ago.

The parts that I couldn't put down were the moments that really hadn't gone into detail in the show: Back-stories of the Targaryens (especially Rhaegar), stories of the Children of the Forest, The Mormonts, etc. Also the reactions of characters to certain events, that we really didnt see. One that really interested me, was what happened after Ned's execution, what did people say/do all over Westeros. GRRM did an amazing job of showing this, and I couldnt put it down. One scene that killed me, more than Ned's death himself was the Bran chapter immediately after. 

""*A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress.
Rickon began to cry. His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor. Bran pulled him close and hugged him.
Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers. He rose, slow as a sleepwalker, and moved to the window. When he whistled, the raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm. There was dried blood on its wings. A hawk, Luwin murmured, perhaps an owl. Poor thing, a wonder it got through. He took the letter from its leg.
Bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper. What is it? he said, holding his brother all the harder.
You know what it is, boy, Osha said, not unkindly. She put her hand on his head.
Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly, a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool robe and tears in his bright grey eyes. My lords, he said to the sons, in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken, we we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well*""

Heartbreaking. This scene had me almost in tears. I was happy I still had some feelings even knowing what was going to happen.

My question is that as I begin ACOK, I am wondering when huge differences between the show and book start happening. I know this season of the show is differing a great deal, but will there start being a lot more characters, moments, back-stories, that are not in the show.

As usual I talk to my friends about what may happen in the future but the main thing everyone was stuck on Sansa getting rapped. Now before you get into a mob mentality i will like to say that rape is horrifically bad and no one should ever experience that in their life. But of all the messed up things that has happened in the span of the show rape is where people say no to? Is it because it's to close to our own reality? If it is than there are far worse things that an individual has experienced/done to others in the show than being raped. for example a child murdering a prostitute for his pleasure, a pregnant woman being stabbed in the stomach. a man being flayed alive, a man dying from a molten crown of gold, oh and lets not forget all the stuff that has happened to Theon when he met Ramsay. 

Theon got tortured, mentally manipulated to the point of breaking, and he got his dick cut off to name a few. Now rape is horrible but that is worse than rape. if this happened to Asha Greyjoy the internet would implode in rage. ""But isn't this lazy writing?"" No! If you put anyone in a room with a guy who likes hunting women like foxes,humiliating and torturing people, raping other women besides a main character, and cutting dicks off; would't it be a safe bet that the guy is capable of raping someone like Sansa.

After the last episode I was just wondering why do the Tyrells even bother, during the war of the 5 kings the Lannisters were too busy with the Starks to actualy harm them. Sure you can say is just because they want Margaery to be queen, but to what end. Margaery isnt helping Highgarden with new policies or anything of a political nature. Why didn't they just take Kingslanding during the war and kill all the Lannisters. Their uniton only benefits the Lannisters and aside form Margaery (not doing anything) as queen, they just lose money and resources they will need during the Winter.",31,4,False,self,,,,,

I mean, we've seen fights in the show since the very first season. Hell, the very first thing we see is Sir Royce fighting a White Walker. Then there's the fights between Ned and Jaime, Oberyn and the Mountain, and Brienne and the Hound. Now, after countless fights in the series over the course of five seasons, people are complaining about characters fighting?

Also, we knew this fight had to happen sometime. We saw Jamie and Bronn sail to Dorne and infiltrate Sunspear with the intention of rescuing Myrcella. What were they supposed to do, stroll up to the gates and decide to go home? This fight had to happen.

So, talking about Sansa and her terrible faith got me thinking that she is one of the most safe characters in the story. Sure, she may suffer, but none of the people that are anywhere close to her can afford to lose her. The Boltons need her to fortify their position, Stannis will probably hame her Quin of the North if he defeats the Boltons, Briene is on stand-by to do her bidding, the Littlefinger is in love with her and is coming with the Knights of the Vale, probably planning to marry her eventually. The Lannisters want her dead, but they are far away, have enough to deal with at home and Cersei seems to think that Peter will try to deal with her so I don't expect anything else from her. I only see two ways Sansa ends up dead anytime soon and they are both a bit of a stretch: First one - she can't take Ramsey anymore, and tries to escape with the help of Briene and when she is outside the castle they encounter random bandits and Sansa is killed in the battle. This won't happen for two reasons - I don't believe Sansa will be broken by Ramsey before Stannin and Peter come and even if something like that happen, Briene is developed like an amazing warrior and I don't see her losing by a no name. Second way - the wildlings do something stupid. Considering that in the book wildlings save the ""Stark at Winterfell"", this is even less likely. So if I had to make a list of people that are not dying anytime soon - Sansa would be... third.


On the first place I would put Danny. She is the entire reason we have anything to do with that part of the world, she has the dragons that are probably gonna stop the White Walkers at the end and she has to be one of the riders. You like to say that no one has plot armor in this story, but there is no way in hell anything happens to her. Even in the books where she was presumed killed by Drogo and left in the wild, I haven't been worried for her for one second. If there is one character that is a ""main character"", it's her.

On the second place - Brann. Similar reason - he is the only reason we have anything to do with part of the world and creatures that will surely play a significant role in the upcoming war... or at least will play a significant role in making Brann ready to be a huge power. 

Sansa is third

Fourth I say is Arya. And not only because I've read the book and know about the fact she has a lot of stuff to be doing. She is also being shaped like a unique weapon and although she is not the only one in Braavos, she is the most important one. I place her behind Sansa because there is much more danger around her and assassin's skills are not so important in the war with the white walkers like dragons and the magic of the first men. 

Fifth I say is John. This is kind of funny considering how the last book ended, but I believe we are going to see much more from him and he is probably the son of Raegar and Lilly Stark, which makes him one of the three dragon riders. 


There are more people that seem like will not be dying anytime soon, but the arguments there aren't as strong. I'd say Tyrion is too beloved even for Martin's cruelty and I don't see Sam going anywhere anytime soon. Same can be said for Peter and Varys. 


Who do you think has no chance of dying anytime soon and why? ",32,3,False,self,,,,,

He was a Hungarian peasant leader rebelling against the throne of Hungary, but he was eventually caught and was forced to sit into a blazing iron throne, with an iron crown and an iron scepter. A lot of peasants were forced to watch and they brought some starving peasants and forced them to eat his molten flesh, and if they did not accept they slashed them immediately.

That's fine, people can have their own opinion and all, but I personally think people may be a bit harsh (let's just wait and see if it all pays off in the next few episodes, okay?). So I shall try to stick up a little bit for a particular moment in the Dorne storyline that's been getting lots of ridicule: [this one.](http://i.imgur.com/UPcmC7b.gif)

Now we can all agree that this looks ridiculous, hilarious even. I mean how could you not think so? Well, let me try to give some kind of justification for this (although that doesn't stop it from looking ridiculous):

* Having any fight scene with more than two people is hard to do without moments like this. Just focus on any background character in a large-scale battle scene and you're bound to notice them doing something silly/unrealistic. Trying to coordinate a lot of people to fight each other is pretty much impossible to do without something like this happening.

* Not only do we have more than two people fighting, but we only have three. At least in a war scene there's a large mass of people to hide the little silly things within. But having only three people really makes it stand out more, especially when we have two of those fighters on the same side. In reality, almost all two-on-one fights like this would end very quickly. But alas, we need our characters to stay alive (I can't believe I just said that in a post on the subreddit for *this* show), and so some shortcuts need to be made.

* They're fighting with three different kinds of weapons. We have a whip (a mid- to long-range weapon), a sword (a mid- to short-range weapon..well, maybe not the latter according to Oberyn), and daggers (a short-range weapon). All three of these weapons require different fighting styles and one-on-one they could be interesting to have clash, but having all three in action at once is a bit chaotic and hard to choreograph. [Hell, even having three of the same kind of weapon is hard to choreograph without some hiccups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0mUVY9fLlw) (and this one even technically has the benefit of two different kinds of weapon, it's more noticeable in the beginning duel in *Revenge of the Sith*, where we have three single-bladed weapons).

So that's my case for that silly moment in that silly scene. Again, it's still funny and I'll definitely watch this gif whenever I need a pick-me-up, but I just wanted to try and calm the Dorne hate flames a little bit, because they can get a little out of control at times. Thank you for your time.",11,5,False,self,,,,,

He will be killed in an equally terrible way that Oberyn was, by FrankenGregor. Margeary will have her head chopped off. The Tyrell line will end, thus rounding Cersei's character arc, with her being like Tywin, eliminating the Rains of Castamere.

Cersei, after her victory over the Tyrells, will be found guilty of murdering King Robert and incest by the Faith Militant, and will be forced to take the walk of shame. She will then strike back by having the Kings Guard slaughter every member of The Faith Militant in Kings Landing. This will contribute to King Tommens decline in popularity among the people.

Cersei will then have to find a new ally by finding a new bride for Tommen. Considering that bridges have been burned with The Reach, Dorne, The Stormlands, and The North(thanks to Littlefingers scheming) Cersei will look to the Riverlands and Walder Frey for help. Tommen will marry Roslin Frey, who's marriage with Edmure Tully was never consummated. 

Stannis will defeat the Boltons thanks to The Red Lady and her magic. Roose and Ramsay will be killed by fire. Stannis will make Sansa Wardeness of The North if she bends the knee. She will not. He will imprison her until she does, where she will develop a relationship with Stannis, Davos, and Shereen. Stannis will cave and make her Wardeness of The North, in spite of her not bending the knee. As Stannis leaves Winterfell, Melisandre will burn down the Weirwood trees, which will bring back the Bran storyline and involve the Children of the Forrest. Stannis will march on The Twins. Littlefinger will then take the North from Sansa, with royal decree in hand, and Stannis will then be flanked by the Knights of the Vale.

Haha. Wild predictions. Any thoughts?

Like he reaaly loved her. But now Cat is gone and all thats left of her is Sansa, who is described as being more beautiful than Cat. I believe that when LF looks at Sansa he sees Cat. So, when he left Sansa with the boltons he only did it cuz he was summoned to Kings landing, which is a summon he couldnt really refuse. If he could he would have stayed at Winterfell at least for a bit and helped Sansa, but he was ok with leaving her alone because he truly thinks she is strong enough to take care of herself. Yea its probably a nice bonus and a good portion of the motivation comes from the fact that she is a stark and can help secure the north, but that doesnt detract from LF's feeling for her. Sansa is LF's one weakness that could potentially lead to his downfall.",46,29,False,self,,,,,

I'm just a guy."" Our friend took pictures of this moment, making it even more epic. My boyfriend hasn't stopped smiling since.

So just finished watching the S05E06 in the early hours of the morning before the kids get up and we get busy with Saturday.

When Ser Jorah is touched by those stone-scaled men s05e05, they show him growing that scaley effect on his forearm too. 

In S05E06 he goes on to touch Tyrion Lannister before the black slave guys with the ship show up.

So how come that effect does not go on to Tyrion Lannister?

The most popular theory about Jon Snow is, that he is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. And season 5 is, so far, strongly hinting at this as well. So let's just assume for a moment that Jon is in fact Rhaegar's son and therefore a Targaryen. Now rewind back to season 1 and put yourself into the shoes of Ned Stark, who promised his dying sister to protect and raise Jon like he was his own bastard son.

In episode 1 King Robert visits Winterfell to name Ned the new hand to replace Jon Arynn. Having fought together during Robert's rebellion they seem to be really good friends. But what would be the consequences if Robert found out about Jon Snow's true heritage? No matter how strong their friendship, Robert is possessed by the idea of eradicating every single last Targaryen in this world. He reminds Ned of the actions of the Mad King, and also of his (false) belief that Rhaegar kidnapped and raped Lyanna. If he knew Jon was a Targaryen, that would probably lead to war between the Starks and the Baratheons. Ned would never hand Jon over to Robert. That's why he wanted him to join the Night's Watch and why he also never told him the truth about it, that the Wall is primarily manned by thieves and rapists. ""Next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother."" Once bound to the NW, Jon's heritage wouldn't matter anymore, and he would be safe.

Then there is the picnic scene with Robert and Ned on the King's Road. First Robert asks Ned about Jon's mother, which Ned immediately blocks off. Then Robert brings up Daenerys marrying Khal Drogo, and that he wants to send her a sharp knife as a ""gift"". We know Ned is the most honourable man in Westeros, so he probably would be against murdering ""innocent"" children anyway. But having raised a Targaryen bastard himself, he becomes especially passionate about this and rejects the idea of killing Daenerys no matter what (later he even throws away his badge and quits out of protest). This also ties into his arguably stupidest move of all, when he confronts Cersei about her incest. He knows that once he tells Robert about this, there'd be no mercy from him and it would be a death sentence for Cersei's children. Ned can emphasize with her situation, because just like she hid the true identity of her children from Robert so did Ned hide Jon's identity. Would he have warned Cersei if Jon hadn't been born? Maybe. But if he had any doubts about confronting Cersei, this would have pushed him over the edge.

If R+L=J then Ned's behaviour makes more sense.",267,383,False,self,,,,,

It follows various characters from the Forester house, surrounding the time of a certain king's death.

You might think it's strange watching a video game for entertainment, and I think it is too. The saving grace of this medium is that it has the voice talent of a lot of the actual cast from Game of Thrones: Margery, Ramsey, Tyrion, Jon, and Cersei are all included (and perhaps others that I'm forgetting).

I shouldn't really have to convince you. It's more Game of Thrones! At least give the first episode a shot.

1. Will we get to see the farce that takes place in the Merman's Court followed by Wyman's speech to Davos be included? Clearly they've missed the opportunity to follow the book exactly, but I'm sure a variant could be done. 

2. What about the feast at Winterfell where my boy Wyman so graciously provides Lord Bolton with some pies?

Considering how much stuff is cut from the show I realize it could be highly unlikely that they or even a variant of them are.

Chapter 32:

&gt;Arya had no choice but to go with him, wishing it had been Fat Tom. With Tom, she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying, but Desmond was too single-minded to trick. How many guards does my father have? she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber.

&gt;Here at Kings Landing? Fifty.

&gt;You wouldnt let anyone kill him, would you? she asked.
Desmond laughed. No fear on that count, little lady. Lord Eddards guarded night and day. Hell come to no harm.

&gt;The Lannisters have more than fifty men, Arya pointed out.

&gt;So they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so you can sleep easy.

&gt;What if a wizard was sent to kill him?

&gt;Well, as to that, Desmond replied, drawing his longsword, wizards die the same as other men, once you cut their heads off.

Chapter 33:

&gt;Roberts face was purple. Out, he croaked, choking on his rage. Out, damn you, Im done with you. What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, Ill have your head on a spike!

Chapter 39:

&gt;A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders, the queen declared.

Chapter 43:

&gt;And Ser Ilyn? The eunuch stroked a plump, powdered cheek. He is the Kings Justice, after all. Sending other men to do his officesome might construe that as a grave insult.

&gt;No slight was intended. In truth, Ned did not trust the mute knight, though perhaps that was only because he misliked executioners. I remind you, the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister. I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty.

&gt;Very prudent, no doubt, Varys said. Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight. I hope he outgrows his disappointment as well. He does so love his work

Chapter 44:

&gt;Sansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; it made her uneasy just to think back on it.

&gt;Ser Ilyns the Kings Justice, not Ser Loras, Jeyne said. Lord Eddard should have sent him.

&gt;Sansa shuddered. Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He made her feel as though something dead were slithering over her naked skin. Ser Ilyns almost like a second monster. Im glad Father didnt pick him.

Chapter 58:

&gt;Stannis Baratheon is Roberts true heir, Ned said. The throne is his by rights. I would welcome his ascent.

&gt;Varys tsked. Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you. Stannis may win the throne, but only your rotting head will remain to cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours.",11,19,False,self,,,,,

I can't put my finger on it but as someone who really doesn't this show to be bad I can't help but feel something is wrong with S5. Maybe it's dorne. Maybe it's King's Landing. Maybe it's the whole merging two massive books into one season deal. It may just be this is my first season that I've regularly checked this sub and seeing all the book reader complaints has fogged my love a bit, I don't know. 

But.. There's so much being built up right now that is about to fucking explode.

With Arya- She's getting towards the end of her training and when she's done I don't see where it's going but I can only expect awesome. (Although the whole faceless man shtick is them changing faces of course which I don't really look forward to because I've become a fan of Maisie.) 

Stannis- He's charging on motherfucking Winterfell with a massive army and I can't see him losing. Although Brienne is still kinda skulking around up there although I doubt she could kill him (I bet the sub would lose their shit because I doubt that's in the books, just seems off.). 

Sansa- She has a whole candle to light and who knows what is gonna happen to Theon. Hopefully he becomes Theon during the battle and fucks shit up.

Jon- I'm not quite sure with Jon. He's off on this savior mission but in the trailer he comes marching off that boat like he's running to battle so... Another battle is a plus I guess. 

Dany- She's about to open the fighting pits and the trailer shows it's gonna be chaos. Let's hope Drogon makes a special appearance and burns those harpies (their called harpies right?)

Tyrion- I just want him to share some good ruling advice and fix her up a bit. 

Jorah- I'm not really sure what's up with him. The Stannis talk did suggest a cure for it and the Red Priest in Volantis (I'm not good with the locations of Essos so I don't know if that's it or not) seemed way too important to only get 2 minutes of screen time.

Cersei- Apart from her being abused by Marg and the Queen of Thorns I'm pretty uninterested in the whole faith of 7 story.. I feel bad for Tommen though. Poor guy just wants to be a gentle king. 

Jaime... The banter between him and Bronn is the only worth while part of Dorne right now. Although now that he is going to Doran I can see something coming of that. Too guys just having a normal chat while that crazy bitch is pushed away(hopefully).

Overall. It kind of turned into a review and I feel I'm forgetting someone but oh well..

TL:DR Battle, battle, bromance, dragon vs harpies, Sansa and Theon stepping up their game, faceless Arya. Hype.

Oh. It could also have something to do with the fact I plan on picking back up ASOS once the season ends so my excitement for that could be a subconscious reason I'm uninterested this season.  

EDIT: I am not speaking for the majority of this sub-reddit of fandom. I only put it that way because most of what I have seen is how it's not as good as other seasons although that is an opinion.

Not even weak, just off, weird, slow, shit is happening but it doesn't feel like it and I guess it's mostly because this season is setting up big stuff for next season or this is a transitional/ filler season. 

But this episode.. It may be on par with the rest of the season and I just don't notice because I woefully want a good episode and I've only slept 4 hours since 10am Saturday (now 6am Monday) so I guess that hope and lack of sleep could have mixed to make me believe this was good. 

But all in all it felt the most Game of Thrones the show has for a while now IMO. It had fighting. It had blood. It had boobs. It had a death. It had a wolf. It had a whitewalker mention. It had a nice cliffhanger and it had a whole lot of snow (it's finally coming guys.) 

(Quick add in: It had the first Dorne scene I've liked so far. Bronn has quite the voice) 
I would do a little attempt at summarizing each characters plot this week but I'm both no good at it and I'm going to try sleep now so just leave your thoughts down below to how you felt about this week's episode and I will either reply within 20 minutes of this post or in a few hours.

I was bored with the Sam &amp; Gilly scenes. Sure Maester Aemon's passing was poignant. But the attempted rape and Ghost appearing to save the day and then the awful drawn out intimate scene later on just left me wanting the story to move on, leave Castle Black already Sam! You were told to go South and you don't have any friends left so get a move on!
Bron &amp; the Sand Snakes, was this an excuse for more tits? They were quite lovely but did we need this scene - I can't remember if we knew Bron was poisoned.. even so was it worth poisoning him, for half an episode? Is he now indebted to the Sand Snakes?
Cersei is painfully short sighted I'm glad to see that story finally getting to where it needed to go.
Jamie was useless talking to Myrcella.
Tyrion rescued the episode with his final scene - though it was convenient random dungeon guy decided to cut him loose.

Lancel could not have been the gift because he was never connected to LF and acted out of his own guilt and faith.  The High Sparrow would require no assistance from LF or Olenna to come to the decision to arrest Cersei, he was just awaiting an opportunity.

Olyvar similarly can't have been the gift because Littlefinger could never have predicted the extremely erratic actions of Cersei leading upto her arrest.  When he left Kings Landing, there was tension.  There was no High Sparrow, nobody even considering militant faith, no arrested Tyrell heirs.  He couldn't have foreseen any of this to provide Cersei with such a gift.  Unless he is calling it a gift after the fact.  But it is Olenna's gift I'm really curious about.

Gendry.  Dumb.  Why need Mendelian evidence to oust Tommen when Olenna needs King Tommen to support Queen Margaery.

The master of whisperers.  He's been missing from the show and I don't know, maybe he can help Olenna or something.  None of the others make sense to me at this moment and I know that Varys has a role to play in King's Landing coming up soon.  What better way to bring him back than to have him assist Olenna build her case and get her grandkids out.  I realize that this is a flimsy idea but nobody else makes sense to me.

What do you cut, what do you keep? How can you shorten things, or tell this story with fewer characters? How can you rewrite a piece of story in a simpler way while making sure not to remove something that needs to be part of the plot later? And it only gets more and more difficult with each season, as the books get longer and longer.

I like almost everything the show has done in this regard. It was a risky move to try cutting Sansa's book storyline to have her follow Jeyne's storyline, but it seems to be playing out well so far and will probably make for much better TV than sticking to the books.

But damn, I miss the Tyrion storyline from the books. His chapters were consistently the best in ADWD, and didn't need changing. It was great seeing him fall off the rails and start to become the monster everyone sees him as, seeing him start to give up on life and not give a shit about anything other than short term pleasures. It was interesting to wonder what he's going to get himself into with this kind of attitude, and how badly he'll crash and burn.

Then there's Penny, one of my favorite late additions to the cast of characters, and a character we didn't even know we'd seen before. She and Tyrion have such a unique relation, and she reminds Tyrion that there's still some good left in this world, dragging him out of his funk. They become a good team, working together to make the best out of bad situations, and even saving Jorah's life.

These were the parts of ADWD that just worked. Tyrion's always up to something, travelling somewhere or doing something new, visibly in action rather than just endlessly talking and plotting. Everything he did was interesting and entertaining, Penny's a great character, and their relationship was heartwarming and unique.

And the show drops all of that, in favor of Tyrion remaining a happy-go-lucky guy who's totally back to normal after killing his father, who meets a slaver one day to set him up with dick jokes, and then in the next episode is dropped in Daenerys' lap? Why did all of the good stuff have to be skipped over? Tyrion's the most popular character, I don't think anyone would mind if most of his storyline was kept in while everyone else's was shortened.

This is the first time that I've really questioned the TV adaptation. The other things, I can see why they did them, and most ended up working very well. The Sand Snakes, hey not everything can go as well as expected, and I still don't think they're as bad as people are saying. But cutting out the best parts of ADWD and skipping most of Tyrion's story... I just can't understand why they would ever want to do that.",7,3,False,self,,,,,

Even if she had known it, I doubt Cersei of all people had the foresight to anticipate that Margaery would be called to testify. She would have assumed that the outcome would be Loras' arrest, but then what? Margaery's still married to the king and she'll be thirsty for revenge.

(x-post from /r/ASOIAF),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/376sk3/tvadwd_the_7_stages_of_appreciating_the_books_and/,WhoeverThatGuyIs,1432548500,"***All credit to /u/pankpankpank !***

...basing it off the 7 stages of Grief...so for the hardcore George/Book dickriders and D&amp;amp;D haters I imagine it would like this:

1. Shock and Denial: We were sure that GOT was going in the wrong direction--none of the storylines are following the books anymore, WTF is happening. Sansa rape scene? No way. Nope this show has just gone too far. 

2. Pain and Guilt: Oh shit, maybe I was wrong about the things I said this season. I actually judged this show too soon to see the plot lines develop, and oh my god, D&amp;amp;D may have actually made one or two plot lines more clever than they were in the books. Oh my god not better than the books, they are the bible, my pain...

3. Anger and Bargaining: Well the show has had its good and bad episodes. I guess maybe the Jorah and Tyrion plotline is kind of cool, and I can get over the loss of Barristan. But god damnit why did they let Sansa get raped? 

4. Depression/Reflection/Loneliness: Posters go silent. Brain isn't working right. Reads books. Watches show again. Can't decide what to do. 

5. Upward Lift: Okay I must admit I do love this show...it may not be perfect but it has not gone downhill in any way. Those massive books are hard to condense into 10 hours of TV. I can accept the absence of some characters, and some of the new plot lines are actually kind of intriguing.

6. Reconstruction: TWOW may actually follow some of these plot lines further. Maybe George was actually heading the same direction as D&amp;amp;D (just more slowly). The more I think about it, the more I realize the show really hasn't deviated that far from the books...its only condensed what it had to. COME ON TWOW MAKE IT TRUE.

7. Acceptance: I enjoy watching GOT as much as I like reading ASOIAF. I understand they are two separate mediums attempting to tell the same story. In the books I get rich detail, more characters, history etc....and the TV show gives me a condensed version that is highly entertaining and allows me to visualize the characters I love in the books. My praise is equal to both.


And there, ladies and gentleman, are the 7 steps to accepting Game of Thrones and ASOIAF as separate mediums telling the same fantastic story.

In King's Landing proper I was born and raised 

At the Red Keep, that's where I spent most of my days

Playing with kittens and being kinda fat

And laughing when my evil ass brother gets slapped

When a big nasty boar came up out of the wood

Started shanking my dad, soon he was dead for good

I am just one little tyke and my mom's impaired

She said 'You listen to your psycho brother now, he's the heir'


I did so and sat quiet until his wedding 

When I gasped as he choked to death before the bedding

If anything the shit in my pants means I'm scared

But my mom says I'm fit to sit the big pointy chair


I pulled on my crown and let ma spread her hate

Burning bridges and arming religious, but then she got taked

I looked at my kingdom

I was violently heir'd

To pout on my throne as the Prince of Despair

Contrast that with her talk with the High Sparrow, where she couldn't get a read on his desires and was absolutely flummoxed by him. He even points out how she can't read him.

Expert poker players can usually bluff other experts with subtleties, but bluffing amateurs is much more difficult. Amateurs aren't smart enough to realize they are being trapped, and call your bluff. The snakes head bites the tail.

Weiss:  We have to get the sand snakes back on track.  People hate them, and rightly so.  We need to redeem them in this scene.  

Benioff: That short dagger-yielding one is so cute.  Anything in her contract about showing her tits?  

Weiss: We made sure there was small print about possibly having to show her giblets.  

Benoiff:  Good.  Let's have her take out her tits at some point.  

Weiss: What should the other two be doing during this time?

Benioff: Anything but performing C-movie fight choreography.  How 'bout if we have Obara say - [gets glare from Weiss].  Look, she is an Oscar-nominated actress - [a 2nd glare from Weiss interrupts him].  Fine.  The Oscar-nominated actress will be restricted to a smirk and a knowing glance to Nymeria.

Weiss: I have another idea.  Who are they sharing this scene with?

Benioff:  Bronn.

Weiss:  Yes.  Who is....

Benioff:  ...a fan favorite?

Weiss:  Correct.  See where I'm going w/ this?

Benioff: You want them to...what...help Bronn?  Like what?  GIVE him the antidote to his cut?  

Weiss: *nods triumphantly*

Benioff:  I see where you're going but that makes no sense in the context.  The sand snakes were just fighting them, would've killed them both in a heart beat, and already landed a killing blow, really.  Why would anyone believe they'd simply give Bronn the antidote?  And you're saying the antidote is going to be with her in the cell?!  

Weiss: It's the only way to redeem them and you know it.  

Benioff: *thinks intensely for a moment, then sighs*  Okay.  You're right.  Tits and the inexplicable saving of a fan favorite it is.

And thusly was written the best episode of season 5 and the greatest Sand Snakes scene of all time.

Since the only other person at the wall that cares for Jon is Sam. I would love to hear all your thoughts on this! ",1,2,False,default,,,,,

He has close relationships with Maester Aemon and Jon Snow. From what I can see, he has learned a lot from Aemon and from the library and saves of Castle Black. But he has also developed personally with help from Jon and Gilly. He has become strong-willed and suddenly believes in himself. And from his previous position close to Aemon, I can now see a  way for him and it is Maester of the night's watch.

I think it was a trick for us to to think that HE IS the gift but for me, it was [Gift Theory](#g ""Gendry"").

If you think about it, why would Lancel still conspire with Petyr after that dreadful approach they had from the prior episodes? I think that Lancel already told the High Septon about Cersei's incestuous doings even before and when the High Sparrow became the High Septon, he cannot arrest Cersei lest there are guards or they were talking inside Cersei's territory which is why with the last episode, it was very convenient for the High Septon to find her, completely putting her guard down and waltzing into the Sept without guard because as far as she knows they were her ""allies"".

As I put it before, it was not Lancel. It was [Gift Theory](#g ""Gendry""). Why? [Gift Theory](#g ""Littlefinger told Olenna about an *information Cersei doesn't know*. Cersei doesn't know that Gendry is still alive because in the earlier seasons, the gold cloaks killed that kid who was holding Gendry's helmet, thus thinking it was the one they were ordered to kill. The last time we saw Gendry, he was rowing off from Dragonstone, which is quite near Harrenhal and Eyrie; of which are controlled and held by Petyr Baelish. If we can flashback a little from season one, it was Littlefinger who planned Ned Stark to discover about Gendry being Robert Baratheon's bastard. For me, it's Olenna Tyrell's perfect revenge. The Lannisters fucked the whole kingdom up after Robert died and they fucked the Tyrells in the ass so hard. If the people find out that Tommen is just a bastard and Gendry is Robert Baratheon's son, there's a possibility that pro-Baratheons that hate Lannister-guts would probably support Gendry's claim to the Iron Throne. Like Tyrion said, the people from Westeros wouldn't just accept Daenerys as their queen, but there's a chance that they might accept Gendry since he has Robert's blood. Having said this, it would overthrow the Lannisters."")

First off, I don't think that there will be a single ruler anymore i think there will be either a council containing many people or individual sections (North, Dorne,South)
ruled by a council of their own.

Next, here are some characters will end up:
Jon Snow/Stark : I see two paths for this guy, one where he helps in the wars to come and gets legitimized but goes back to the wall, the other where he plays a part in the political changes that will overcome Westeros.
Danearys: The deeper we go into her plot (not very deep due to shallowness),I see her claim fading and her presence in Westeros not very needed.(as i said these are my opinions) She could stay in  Essos and rule there after she helps in the wars to come.
Stannis: I think he will die but i hope not. If he survives and changes his intentions, he will probably become one of the council members in the numerous councils above.( i might be very wrong about this one because he is so obsessed with becoming King)
Theon: Will die soon,performing an act of redemption
Sam: i think this guy will have a happily-ever-after ending to his plot, go and live his life with gilly and little sam.
Tyrion:Will help Danearys or go on the councils.

I would love if some of you could give some of your theories on the following and any other character:
Jaime, Margeary, Tommen, Cersei,Bronn, Bran..."")

Ever since the books/show started I've felt like the Wall has to fall down when the White Walkers finally invade. It's just too cool of a visual for a storyteller to NOT do.

Here's how I think it could happen in a plot-friendly way: someone (the details aren't very important) gets stuck north of the Wall and ends up getting chased by some White Walkers. They find their way into some mysterious tunnels. During the chase they realize the tunnels go on for miles and miles, almost the entire length of the Wall. They also seem to be filled with some kind of Wildfire or other magic device.

Eventually they are cornered and before being killed, a White Walker finally speaks for the first time, ""What do you think we were doing all this time? The Wall is what separates us from truly invading and destroying everything. It has to fall. So much time waiting, preparing, but now we are ready.""

He even goes as far as to show how frivolous he finds it when at the Eerie he is told ""You don't fight with honour!"" and he replies ""No, but he did"".

Instead, the first snows of winter aren't even until season five, presumably years later.

So how long has the summer been? I thought it was only going to be 10-11 years, but it seems like it's been going on for fifteen years at this point. Anyone have any specific info about this?",6,0,False,self,,,,,

The same kind I gave Cersei  **a handsome young man.**""

Now I think he is talking about Olyvar, and making him not testify against the Tyrells by either killing him or in some other way.

My friend, on the other hand, seems to think that he is talking about Lancel, and forcing him to confess about Cersei (which I don't think makes sense since I imagine he would have done that by now anyway) so that the Tyrells get ""even"". Another friend thinks that Baelish just slipped the information to the Sparrow, because Lancel was still protecting Cersei so he wouldn't confess unless pressured. 

And another possibility I've come up with is that he is talking about Robyn Arryn, and the army of the Vale, which I don't think is really likely.

[This recap from The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/25/game-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-seven-the-gift) also supports the Olyvar theory, but what do you guys think he's talking about (without too many book spoilers if possible, please)?",14,10,False,self,,,,,

This doesn't surprise me because Stannis hasn't ever really seemed to buy into her religion, even if he did believe in her magic. Selsye is a true believer though, and I believe she will kidnap Shireen, and take her to the Red Lady to be sacrificed anyways. 

I think Melisandre will leave Stannis to head to The Wall to try to convince Jon Snow that he is Azor A'hai. She will take many soldiers with her, the other true believers. Stannis' army will get even smaller, the odds stacking against him even more. Selsye kidnaps Shireen and they burn her in the north, beyond The Wall. The magic from it does something major.

Maybe when Melisandre sees herself in Winterfell in the fires, she's seeing herself being executed by Stannis, after he's taken Winterfell and captured her.

I don't understand why Queen Margeary is in prison. The rumours concerning her brother were well-known, and the allegations made agaisnt him were credible and i guess sufficient to bring him to trial.

However, I don't understand why the Queen is imprisonned as well. In the end, it's her word ('i didn't know about my brother's tendencies') agaisnt Olyvar's ('she saw us')... I genuinely don't understand why a prostitute's word would have more weight than the Queen's, and be enough to imprison her...

In this week's episode, almost the same thing happened, Cersei was imprisonned following Lancel Lannister's allegations agaisnt her. Maybe, as a Sparrow, Lancel Lannister's sworn word is valuable to the High Sparrow and the judicial system, and even though this seems to me rather surprising, it could be plausible that to their religious legal system, a sparrow's word is at least as worthy as the Queen Mother's (maybe more?).

As a law student I may be trying to read too much into this, but imprisonning the royals is definitely a huge thing, and at least for Margeary there is no reasonable ground for that. It's the Queen's word agaisnt a prostitute's, and somehow, without any proof, it was enough to imprison her, and I just don't understand how that is possible


I understand that to the High Sparrow it shoudln't matter whether you are dirt poor or the Queen herself, but still, it doens't change the fact that Margeary was imprisonned because of a witness' testimony, and for all they know, he could have lied.

Is there anything I may have missed that would explain all this? Were these questions maybe answered in the books (which i havent read.. yet)?

This is really bothering me and starting to interfere with my enjoyment of the show...

Thank you for your time and answers! ",15,7,False,self,,,,,

This is what I think might happen by breaking down the preview for episode 8.

1.*""Why should the people trust a queen that can't keep her promises?"" - Rastafarian Targaeryan*

I don't want this to be true, but Dany might execute Sir Friendstone. After she delivers the quote, a Queen's Guard walks up behind him. Didn't she say something along the lines of ""Imma kill you if I see your face again""?

2.*""If I could do what Ramsay did to you, I would."" -Queeninnanorf*

Sansa stops playing the begging game and starts playing the scaring game. Trying to scare Reek into helping her by proposing that she can inflict pain on him as well. I think she knows Theon is gone. Might as well give Reek a shot.

3.*""I won't kneel before some barefooted common and beg his forgiveness."" -Tart Queen: Cersei*

She done fucked up. I think Loras and Margaery will ask for forgiveness and be pardoned while Cersei is too proud and of course not want to admit of participating in incest and adultery.

4.*""Jon's taking a risk. But he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise."" -Samwell ""OH! MY!"" Tarlly*

Talks some sense into Ollie and makes the kid understand that Jon is doing the right thing..

5.*""My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow."" -WILD-LING!*

To be honest, I think the WILD-LINGS! will be split and they will fight it out amongst themselves. I bet Tormund Giantsbane will kick some nay sayer arse.

Well, if the wars in Westeros were inspired by the War of the Roses, the Tudors and the split of England's church might have our answer. The Buggery Act of 1533, which outlawed sodomy, was made under Henry the Eighth. It ensured that ""sodomites"" faced penalties at the level of state and could include members of nobility and the church. More importantly those tried and found guilty of sodomy could have their lands, titles, money and possessions taken by the state. Henry probably had this in mind when he made this law. Which was enforced to increase Henry's holdings. Members of the state and Catholic monks and nuns in England lost big due to this law, and nobles did too. Interestingly, Henry was not the first to outlaw sodomy and use it against his foes: Philip the Fourth of France used it against the Knights Templar in 1307.

But don't take my word for it, read The War of the Roses (an excellent book) or go to Wikipedia and look up the fall of the Knights Templar or The Buggery Act of 1533 yourself to learn more. 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggery_Act_1533

In context of the Western medieval/Renaissance/Tudor mindset which partly inspired the Seven Kingdoms in Game of Thrones, ""buggery"" was viewed as an upper class sin with connotations of decadence and overindulgence, or part of a greater understanding of poor self control only afforded to the rich. GRRM has stated the Catholic Church and scisms within were the inspiration for the Faith Militant, further offering evidence of this tie. Being homosexual wasn't the issue, the issue was ""buggery"" which carried certain anti-populist baggage. The High Septon hating this ""sin"" makes sense, since he seeks to be a populist ruler, against the decadence of the non-pius rich. He's no King but he does want to seize power for his church and the people, so who knows if the Faith Militant will use these charges for land grabs against the houses. I'd say it's likely their purpose. 

I am not against two dudes getting it on myself, but for the High Septon, he sees it as evidence of what he already suspects: the rich are degenerates who need to be brought down. This is why he thoroughly stumps Lady Oleanna, she can't possibly grasp the greater populist message behind charging her grandson with ""buggery."" All she sees is the game play, and the player. It would be wise of her to consider the message behind it, and with time, she will. The High Septon is not be a good person but he is perfectly in line with his message and historical precedent in our own world.",2,17,False,self,,,,,

After reading that we can see Selyse crying/crawling on the ground in a scene from one of the trailers, I decided watch them to see what I can expect in the last 3 episodes. I found that a lot of the scenes in them have not been shown yet. A few in particular caught my eye. 

The first being the a few glimpses of Jon snow charging into battle with the free-folk. Having not read the books myself I'm not sure if it is explained in them, but I'm curious if anyone has any speculation on who they are fighting. I'm not sure who it could be other than the Boltons, as the nights watch shouldn't have enemies south of the wall at this point but the people in the scene are clearly human, but that's under the assumption that they're back at the wall at that point. And even then, why would they be fighting the Boltons unless they are helping Stannis? Maybe it's another tribe who refuses to work with a crow. Any other ideas what that scene may be about?

Another one that caught my attention was the glance we get of the sons of harpy surrounding a bunch of fighters in the fighting pits. I was under the assumption that with Dany marrying Hizdar, the sons of the harpy would calm down, however watching these makes me interested in what they are doing.

Any theories you guys have would be greatly appreciated. I don't know what to expect anymore after watching the trailers except that we should be in for an intense last three episodes.",8,5,False,self,,,,,

What are we to make of this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/37b13z/spoilers_all_theory_concerning_sandor_clegane/,horrible_jokes,1432629220,"**DISCLAIMER:** In case I used the wrong flair, I'd just like to clarify that this post contains spoilers for Season 4 and potentially season 5. I can't vouch for book readers, this goes beyond their scope too, so they'll have to take a chance here.

I'm not usually one for crazy tinfoil theories. But activity this month in light of a comment I made about a month ago seemed rather interesting to me.

On April the 11th, I commented on a thread mourning the loss of our beloved Sandor Clegane. As I recall, a quick read of his wikipedia page at the time turned up some [rather interesting information.](http://i.imgur.com/CbKN4bc.png)

I commented with said information. Although I can't find the thread (and don't recall deleting my comment), [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/328dv9/spoilers_all_get_hype/) should be reasonable proof of its existence. As I recall, a couple of people 'got hype', but it never gained that much attention. I forgot about the matter, until I realised that episode 8 airs this weekend. Suddenly excited, as a long time worshipper of the fucking Hound, I jumped onto the wikipedia page. But strangely enough, it has since been altered. [See for yourself.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McCann) No mention of him being set to appear in season 5.

How strange, I thought, so I decided to do a little research. I decided to check the page [revision history](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rory_McCann&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20140430154731&amp;action=history). On April the 11th, mere hours after I posted my comment, [a person with a strange username](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/2A02:1811:3387:9500:447F:7273:4629:7D7A) edited away the guest appearance listing.

Further research shows this person to have contributed to [Bryan Cogman](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bryan_Cogman&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=645589749), a show writer's, page just 7 hours before editing out Rory's guest appearance listing. This revision credited Bryan with writing Kill the Boy and Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken on the 11th of April, a whole month before it aired (even the fanbase wasn't privy to the episodes' names at that point, if I recall correctly.)

This leaves me questions and an unsure feeling in my stomach. Obviously, someone rather high up the production side of Game of Thrones intervened and corrected something- this being displayed by the article reviewer's knowledge of unaired episodes' names well before release. This person removed a guest listing for the actor in the upcoming episode.

Should we be excited? Are they covering up a big reveal? Or just correcting a mistake? Although I must admit, a season 5 episode 8 guest listing is a very specific mistake.

Who would bet money that they're going to reintroduce our favourite Clegane this weekend?

In case this gets buried, at least I can say ""I told you so"" if any surprise reveals get churned out this week.

I realise that it might not be clear how I figured out that the wiki user edited away the guest star listing. On [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rory_McCann&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=655486785), check the 'television' section for Game of Thrones appearances. Now scroll to the top page, click the little ""previous revision"" text and check the same box again.",37,60,False,self,,,,,

So it is said that the only people who know the secret of that are the maesters, the alchemists of Lys and the faceless men.

So as we know from the show (haven't read past ACOK so I am clueless) the strangler is the poison used by Littlefinger and Olenna to kill Joffrey. How could they know of the poison, and how could they get it on their hands? Getting a faceless dude to give them seems silly, and idk why they would go to they alchemists of Lys. So the last point are the maesters. I believe Pycelle had a part in Joffrey's death, since he seemed very eager to fuck Tyrion up in the trial (and he seemed very knowledgable about the poison, being a maester), possibly covering his murder too. Besides, we already know Pycelle is a snitch, pretending to be someone who he is not, so that doesn't seem unlikely for him to do.

Tommen is the product of incest so he's illegitimate and has no claim to the throne. Lancel knows about Jamie and Cersei through Tyrion. Then he told the High Sparrow. So the church will dethrone Tommen Waters. 

Stannis doesn't believe in the seven so he's illegitimate too. Even if he repents he would have to go from the North to King Landing. Stannis will probably loose against the Bolton's since he isn't sacrificing his daughter to R'llor. If he survives he will have only a small retinue and it's a long way from Winterfell to Kings Landing. The Mannis would have to travel through the Frey controlled Riverlands and they won't let him. 

Daenerys is the product of incest too while she isn't illegitimate because her parents were married. The Targaryens are responsible for eradicating the Faith Militant. So she won't be Queen by the grace of the church.

The High Sparrow is not Howland Reed in this scenario so Jon Snow does not become king. 

Without Claimants they are going to elect a king. The mightiest men in the realm will be Kevan Lannister the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, the ruler of Dorne but he won't care, the Tyrells and the Warden of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale: Petyr Baelish. At this point he will have defeated the Bolton's with Sansas help so he gets the support of the north. The Vale will follow him because he is the late husband of Lysa and he gifts Harrenhall to the Frey's. 

But the Faith Militant hates Littlefinger you say? He knows that. He marries Margarey and then with the might of the Tyrells and his domains Littlefinger will smash these fanatics. Margarey will be the Queen and Littlefinger will be the king.",15,1,False,self,,,,,

Abandoned Plotline Brothers Without Banners, is their a single group that cares about commoners other than them? I mean, even including minor nobility and bastards, the number of the nobility cannot exceed 10% of the total population. Even the heroes we root for - The Starks, Jon Snow, Tyrion, and more recently Stannis - were all born to wealth and opulence regardless of their family dynamics, and are the subject of the viewer's constant sympathy. Meanwhile, while there are a few lowborn characters(and I am not arguing there should be more), they are usually shown to be powerless and without any way to help themselves until they are made a member of the nobility through some manner of shenanigans. 

I understand they have faults but who doesn't? Sandor Clegane murdered a child yet people root for him, Ygritte took part in both on screen and off screen mass murders of civilians beyond the wall yet we support(ed) her, Bronn is a cutthroat who no doubt killed quite a few innocents in his day, even the Starks do not have clean hands.

The point I'm making is that the Sparrows have obvious faults, but like real life so does everyone. Their homophobia and hatred of ""evils"" like alcohol are not plus sides but the audience has repeatedly shown they can support a character or group that has committed far worse atrocities, even when their only motivation is looking out for #1, because they have more characterization and screen time.

Be opposed to them overall, that's fine, but with the outpour of anger towards them, even calling the High Sparrow a monster and the like, sort of just screams to me that the same people care less about the crimes actually committed and more how much screen time certain people get, and the commoners don't get much.

* Thinks everyone is his to torment
* Starts a war which results in the deaths of thousands of smallfolk (a war during which he conveniently hid behind his grandfather)
* Treats Sansa like shit and subjects her to physical and mental torture
* Sadistically murders prostitutes because he can and orders all the smallfolk to be killed over a minor altercation
* He's so psychotic that Tyrion thinks he's the true succesor to the mad king

High Sparrow:

* Punishes those who have sinned in the eyes of his gods without any mercy(unless they confess)
* Gives food and clothing to those who follow his gods and he take care of them

The High Sparrow is certainly a bad guy but compared to Joffrey,the guy is a saint.Which is why it amazes me that so many here want Joffrey back so that he can kill the High Sparrow and his followers!

*  House Tyrell :

 Starves the innocent people of Kings landing only because they happen to live under a different king
(in season 2).Have no qualms about starving the innocents even now to get their two highborn children out of jail.How is House Tyrell's behaviour of persecuting innocents for their game of thrones any different from the High Sparrow persecuting innocents who don't obey his gods?And yet House Tyrell gets a lot of support compared to the High Sparrow!

Question:


* As viewers,have we spent so much time following the nobles and the storylines that we've forgotten the impact that their games have on the smallfolk who can't defend themselves?Have we developed the same attitudes of the nobles:that smallfolk should follow their house irrespective of the damage the House's actions have on their lives?Do we subconsciouly consider the smallfolk to be lesser than the nobles like Margarery and Loras?And in that way,has this fanbase developed tunnel vision in seeing things only from the POV of the nobles?

tl;dr:  

***The High Sparrow is bad news.But he has done far less damage than the likes of Tyrells,Lannisters,Joffrey etc did while playing their game of thrones.IMO some of the  fanbase is developing tunnel vision and seeing and understanding things only from the POV of the nobility which has made  it difficult for them to sympathise with the smallfolk who support a man who genuinely cares for them.***",31,3,False,self,,,,,

Considering the Throne was basically forged with Fire and what not, and how much the White Walkers seem to be in general opposition to forces connected with that, would it be in their mind to maybe just end the dominion over the totality of Westeros as being a thing since it was instituted by the Targaryens with their fire breathing dragons? Just a thought. 

In regards to how he might destroy the Iron Throne, I was specifically reminded of that moment back in Season 3 Episode 8 where the White Walker approaches Sam. He grabs Sam's blade, and it magically shatters. Does that mean the White Walkers can just do that to any metal? Do we have any information about that? So I just imagined a moment where at the end of an episode in some later season where the Night's King somehow communicates to the people of the Seven Kingdoms that he's pissed off with the whole idea of an Iron Throne existing at all, and he just does some White Walker scream or touches the Throne and it just shatters into a million pieces to signify the end of that age. IMO, it would be pretty epic. 

I apologize if somebody's all ready thought of this, I'm relatively new to this subreddit. I'm trying to get a feel for it, and I'm trying to provide as much value as I can theory wise. 

All forms of feedback would be highly welcome, I've been wondering this for a while now. What do you guys think?

But even so do you think  it will still happen? 

Most people favour Jon, Danny and Tyrion to do so due to Danny and Jons blood line(If we consider R+L=J)  as well as Tyrions  obsession with dragons and the theory of his true father. 

Also its interesting to note that Danny, Jon and Tyrion are all the third and final children of their parents and that all of their mothers lost their lives birthing them. Yes Danny had other brothers and sisters but they did not live longer than a year.

1) The rape/assault scene with Gilly was just ridiculous. So all the brothers go around raping women, no consequences? Even if John Snow is not around they would likely be hanged for rape and nearly killing another brother.  Was this fanfiction?

2) Reek going to Ramsey with the candle.  Was this a surprise to anyone? Nice cinematography but was very predictable.

3) Okay so Jorah was sold off, he is described as a badass fighter.  Why would a slaver buy Tyrion? Makes no sense in the context of the world and events. He is a loss of money, how will the slaver recover his investment.  Just written to keep Tyrion and Jorah together.  And written badly.

4) Don't get me started with Danny and Darrio.  Straight out of a soap opera.  Bad writing, very bad.

5) Jamie and Marcella.  High school bullshit.

6) Sand Snakes and Bronn.  I love Bronn and those were some of the best breasts on the show but the scene was horrible.  It does not make sense for them to give the antidote to Bronn.  Not in the context of the work created by George R. R. Martin.  What sense does it make to heal an enemy? Only if you want to keep a popular character alive.  Just keeps the show moving forward.

7) Okay you, you and you and you and you go fight.  Main characters hang back for no reason that needs explaining.  Okay now we need to make it dramatic so Jorah come out and start fighting, no you don't have to worry about guards or chains. Let's make Tyrion wait a few minutes to come out when it is dramatically appropriate, but how?  I know make him try to break the chains, but when the moment is right make someone break them without explanation.  But make the guy nod, that will be enough for the idiots watching.

8) We waited long enough, let's arrest Cerci in the most predictable way possible.  It will come as a shock to... no one.  

There were redeeming scenes in the show, like with The High Sparrow and The Queen of Thorns.  And Aemon and the Egg scene.  Those scenes are good because the actors are spectacular.  The show has fantastic actors who play their scenes so well that you keep watching but the writing this season has stunk to high heaven.  It is filler after filler and the most predictable mundane writing that seems to patronize the audience.  If anyone else feels this way please tell me.  I feel like this season has gone downhill and fast.  What are they going to do to salvage what was the best show I had ever seen?  Am I wrong, does anybody else feel this way?  I stopped reading the books to not get ahead of the show.  I now feel like I should stop watching the show and go back to the books.

This made me think about one question: is there any really smart character in this show?    
It seems to me that everyone has many flaws in interpreting and playing the Game. I mean that in a world like that you should be prepared for everything, like in chess play you should be prepared for every move your opponent may do (with the complication that in GoT you play against tens of opponents, and each one wants to kill you in the most painful way).    
Who do you think is really smart?

The show's producers have often tried many different methods to mask the exposition that was absolutely necesary, sometimes in a clever manner, others not so much (like the infamous ""sexposition"" of earlier seasons). 

So I wonder why not just take a more practical approach?

We already had this nicely done official videos dealing with many of these subjects, even voiced by some of the actors for extra familiarity:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjbjdZE_fYU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iQv17T4Rgk

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOgA8Ik7rhs

Why not just play one of them at the start of each episode, hopefully relevant to the events and plot of that particular one, they are reasonably entertaining and provide the viewers some quick content without forcing the show to use gimmicks to try and set the context. They are so short that for the anyone that wanted could easily avoid them but it would provide in my opinion an easier solution to present context than just the often forced monologues.",2,8,False,default,,,,,

1. Tyrion kills his father.  
2. Joffrey gets poisoned by Littlefinger and Lady Olenna partnership.
3. Cersei gets held captive by the High Sparrow.

Not sure if this has been mentioned yet, but..

Everyone's wondering why Tyene gave Bronn the antidote, and I think I may have a theory as to why.

It's a power play. Tyene was the Sand Snake that Bronn specifically fought. At the end of the fight he says, ""You don't fight so bad for a girl,"" and she lunges at him, but is stopped by the other guards.

When she gets his heart racing, she's not only making the poison become activated in his system, but she's also using her sex to seduce him and make him want her, and then uses that power to say, ""I have the one thing that could save your life, tell me what I want to hear and I will give it to you.""

Granted, she's basically having him say that she's pretty and not that she's a good fighter, so it's a bit vapid, but she's still using what she's got to get what she wants.

I'm not patting myself on the back for this theory, and who knows? Maybe she really did give him more poison, but I think she was showing Bronn that she is not who he assumes she is.

If they killed Tommen that would leave a power vacuum in the Seven Kingdoms, with Stannis and Myrcella as the only ones with claims on the throne but both far away.  Even so this could mean the end of the unified monarchy in Westeros.  

I find this theory especially interesting because it is happening at the worst time possible.  Winter is coming, and the White Walkers will be invading soon.  With no monarch, each of the kingdoms will be on their own to fend them off, which does not bode well for Westeros.",22,13,False,self,,,,,

Let me start by saying I recently started reading the books after watching the show and am coming to the end of ASOS and have to say that they are the most incredible, engrossing and magical novels I have ever read. Thank you GRRM! 

I think the books offer a much more detailed and in-depth exploration of Martin's masterfully-crafted universe than the show, and by extension its themes and messages as well. 

One that I picked up on (I've probably missed most of them :P) is King's Landing being a microcosm for society with the unequal distribution of wealth, food and resources - the many starve while the few live lives of luxury and have seventy-seven course feasts. I thought this was really interesting and highlights a very important and unfortunately relevant message about the world we live in. Good to know Martin is a socialist. 

Another, which was pointed out to me when watching an interview with the man himself, was the theme that true evil doesn't come from orcs or dragons or any other kind of fictional beast - it comes from humanity itself. I found this really interesting and the depiction of evil throughout the series, and indeed the TV show, is really prominent and an important message. All the vicious acts we've read about and seen develop this, and it makes sense in the context of today's society where evil most certainly does exist.

Anyway, this isn't my strong suit, so let me know what I've missed and what you guys have picked up on! I find it to be a really interesting topic. ",0,3,False,self,,,,,

I don't think we'll find out the clear plan he has with her until the end of the entire series. What I continue to scratch my head about is his involvement with the Faith Militant. 

In his meeting with Lady Olenna at his dead brothel, he told her he had a gift for her. ""The same kind I gave Cersei, a handsome young man."" So, he's telling the viewer he has plans for Lancel. However, Lancel didn't seem aligned with Petyr when they met in the courtyard upon Petyrs arrival in King's Landing. In fact, it seemed as though Lancel was very suspicious of Baelish and ready to make him do the naked walk. So, are we to believe that Petyr is in cahoots with the High Sparrow? How? Why? When? It just doesn't make any sense to me. If he were, why would it be in Petyr's favor to punish Margery as well as Cersei. He gave Cersei the boy that was with the Margery's brother, and now he's giving Lancel to Lady Olenna. Why does the High Sparrow need Petyr Baelish when he's already known about Lancel? And also why would the High Sparrow trust a man like Baelish who is known to be sneaky and is not aligned with the beliefs of the Faith? What am I missing here? I appreciate anyone's feedback about this. It seems very complicated and I'm having a lot of trouble finding ANY degree of explanation.

**Note on Spoiler Scope**


Okay this one is a bit tricky, as always the main tag  of S5/ADWD is for the most recent episode as well as for the books up to where we are in the show, for the sake of the comments section, but for the supplemental tag I tagged it as such because there is no way to avoid talking about Aegon/Egg without discussing the Tales of Dunk and Egg series of novellas, including a couple of important plot points from those books, thus I included the D&amp;E tag as part of this post.. However the D&amp;E spoilers will be for the early part of the post, and I will try to be as vague as possible on the events of those novellas... other than that, this will be a straight LORE post, I hope you enjoy..

----------


**The Early Lives of Aegon and Aemon**

- A Post-War and peaceful Westeros

Both Prince Aemon and Aegon were born into a realm fresh off one of the largest civil wars in the history of Westeros.  This war known as The first of the Blackfyre rebellions was a conflict where Daemon Blackfyre a bastard, but legitimized son of King Aegon IV made war with his trueborn half brother King Daeron II Targaryen in an attempt to seize the Iron Throne.  That rebellion was squashed and Daemon Blackfyre slain, and the realm entered into one of the longest stretches of peace that it had ever known.  In the wake of the rebellion House Targaryen was a prosperous as it had ever been.  King Daeron II Targaryen had his seat and realm secure; standing beside him a plethora of heirs.  King Daeron had 4 sons, and twice as many grandsons and granddaughters, it was the largest his house had ever been since before the Dance of the Dragons, nearly 100 years prior. And among his heirs were his two youngest grandsons, prince Aemon, and young prince Aegon.  

Aemon was named for his great-great uncle, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight of the Kingsguard, known to be one of the greatest knights to have ever lived. Aegon was named for many who had preceded him in the family.  Being so close in age as opposed to their older siblings both Aegon and Aemon were pretty close during their childhood, indeed it was Aemon himself that gave Aegon his nickname of Egg, short for Aegon.  Aegon would be known by that name throughout his childhood, adolescence, and into his early adulthood.  

- Aemon goes to Oldtown, and Egg meets a hedge knight

When Aemon was around 9 years old and showing himself bookish and very intelligent he was sent to Oldtown by his grandfather, King Daeron to study at the citadel and eventually forge his Maester's chain.. This served two purposes, Aemon was a 3rd son of the King's 4th son, and never likely to inherit anything, and secondly the King realized having so many heirs in the capital was a dangerous thing, especially given that not all sons of Daemon Blackfyre were dead, and there were those still in the realm who had fought for the Blackfyres.  Separating your family in the event of an incident was a wise decision, and so Aemon was sent to Oldtown.   Egg however remained at court and served as a page.  

While Egg was close to Aemon the opposite could be said about his relationship with his next eldest brother, Aerion Brightflame who was cruel and sadistic towards Egg, even once threateningly-joking to castrate Egg so he could be a wife that Aerion could marry, as well as killing Egg's pet cat.  Egg loathed everything about Aerion, and justifiably so.    Eventually Egg wound up as a squire for his eldest brother Daeron The Drunkard Targaryen and was was his station when Lord Ashford decided to hold a Tourney at Ashford Meadow.  It was at an inn prior to the tourney where Egg met a young hedge knight, by the name of Ser Duncan the Tall.  Impressed with the character of the knight Egg began to follow him around and eventually become his squire.. Duncan, better known as Dunk did not know at the time that he had named a Targaryen prince as his squire at the time, as Egg had taken to shaving his head and wear clothing more suited to that of the lower born.  However his identity did become apparent after Dunk was involved with an incident with prince Aerion at the tourney, resulting in a Trial of Seven for assaulting a prince.  In the aftermath of what transpired left Aegon's uncle Prince Baelor Breakspear (and heir to King Daeron)  dead from an accidental mishap at the hands of his own brother, but nonetheless Dunk the victor in his trial.  Egg was allowed by his family to remain a squire to Ser Duncan, and together the two began to travel the realm..


- Dunk and Egg

Over the next couple of years Egg and Ser Duncan travelled the realm, living off the land, and spending time among the lower born of the country.  Egg kept his head shaved and his identity secret during their travels, for obvious reasons of his own personal safety.  The pair escaped a potential death when they traveled to Dorne during the Great Spring Sickness a plague that killed tens of thousands throughout the realm, including King Daeron as well as his two most immediate heirs, prince Valarr and prince Matarys (Both sons of the late Prince Baelor Breakspear).  Daeron's second son Aerys, first of his name, became King during this period.  Dunk and Egg  being in Dorne saved them from this illness as Dorne, with it's natural boundaries were able to shut down all roads leading into their region avoiding the illness.  After the illness was done, Dunk and Egg resumed their travels and adventures throughout the land, including resolving a conflict between the very minor houses of House Osgrey and House Webber, as well as finding themselves in the middle of and thwarting a potential uprising when at the Tourney at Whitewalls, the son of Daemon Blackfyre, Daemon II Blackfyre reemerged in an attempt to gain support at an attempt at the throne, this small conflict that never went beyond the walls of Whitewalls is known as the Second of the Blackfyre rebellions.  


(**NOTE:**  Spoilers for The Tales of Dunk and Egg end here.  While more is known about the lives of Dunk and Egg, which we will get to in a moment, that mainly comes from general backhistory and more recently the World of Ice and Fire.  However some of what I cover going forward in some areas might be a little vague, that is because some of the given backhistory (mainly form what is provided in TWOIAF) is vague and sparse on details.  The reason for this is because GRRM wishes to write more Dunk and Egg novellas, several more in fact as GRRM states he wishes for his D&amp;E series to cover the entire lives of the pair.  I just wanted to make you aware that if I am being very withholding of details in this post it is because the source material is also withholding of details for the sake of future novellas) 

-  Egg in Adulthood

As I stated above we do not know very much of the life of Egg in the time of his adolescence and the time until he was crowned King, but we know a couple of things.  We do know that he continued his companionship and travels with Ser Duncan the Tall (Once again, fodder for future Dunk&amp;Egg novellas).  When Egg was 19 he was able to prove himself in battle when the 3rd of the Blackfyre rebellions came to pass.  Haegon Blackfyre, another son of Daemon Blackfyre, invaded Westeros in a short lived and minimally supported campaign that ended with Haegon's death, but the Blackfyre line remained.  During the time of his adolescence Aegon did build up somewhat of a reputation in his travels, as he spent most of his time among the common born he gained the reputation and somewhat of a mistrust amongst the high lords for Egg's attitude towards the common among the realm.  Egg to many was half a peasant himself amongst the high born. 

When he reached adulthood Egg married, not wishing to follow Targaryen traditions he married outside his family, and also married for love, not by arrangement.  Egg at age 20 married Betha Blackwood, aka Black Betha (named for her dark eyes and jet black hair) for love.  Egg did not break any betrothals in this marriage, and since (at the time) Egg was so far down the line of succession his marriage did not provoke any hostility of any other Lord wishing to marry into House Targaryen.  Together Betha and Egg had 5 children of their own, the eldest of which was named Duncan after his closest friend.  Though as the years passed it seemed more and more likely that Egg had a greater, kingly future in store...


------------------



**The Ascension of King Aegon V Targaryen**


- A series of unfortunate Targaryen deaths

While Egg''s place in line for the Iron Throne was very, very far down the latter, throughout his life he did find himself moving up that ladder due to a string of deaths that happened to House Targaryen.  I have already mentioned the deaths of King Daeron II's eldest son and heir, Prince Baelor Breakspear due to a tourney mishap, as well as the death of Baelor's sons in the Great Spring Sickness. So at the time of Daeron II's death the crown fell to King Aerys I Targaryen.. Now King Aerys (Second Son of King Daeron II) was very reclusive and spent most of his time relegated to books and isolation, so much so that he never consummated his marriage with his wife and eventually died without children of his own.. King Daeron II's third son, Rhaegal had died from choking on lamprey pie, and Rhaegal's only son Aelor died a couple of years later after he was killed in an accident involving his twin sister/wife.   Ultimately, after the death of King Aerys I, the throne went to his brother Maekar Targaryen, the 4th son of King Daeron II.  

However King Makear's line was itself marred with death.  His eldest son and heir, Daeron The Drunkard (Who would have been Daeron III Targaryen) died of an STD caught from a prostitute, leaving behind only a daughter, Princess Vaella.  Maekar's 2nd son, Prince Aerion Brightflame himself died before his father when a bout of insanity overtook him and he willingly drank a cup of wildfire thinking it would turn him into a dragon.  Prince Aerion did leave behind an infant son, Prince Maegor.  Thus was the state of things when fighting a minor lord rebelling in Dorne that King Maekar was slain.. Thus with no clear heir apparent a great council was called in 233AC

- The Great Council of 233AC

There were 4 principal claimants to the Iron Throne when King Maekar Targaryen died.  Princess Vaella, daughter of the late Prince Daeron.  Prince Maegor, son of the late Prince Aerion, Prince Aemon who had long since forged his Maester's chain, and lastly Egg himself.  Thus the great council, made up of the many representatives of the high houses of Westeros to sort out who would be the next monarch.  Pricess Vaella was passed over outright, citing both that she was regarded as a feeble minded and simple girl as well as the precedent set in the great council of 101AC (Which itself made clear that the next available male heir should inherit over a female).  A few representatives spoke on behalf of Prince Maegor, though he too was passed over, citing reasons that he was still an infant and his crowning would mean year of regency for the realm, as well as the council wanted to avoid the son possibly inheriting the madness and cruelty of his father Aerion.  Ultimately the crown was offered to  Aemon Targaryen under the request that he would have to abandon his oaths as a Maester, to which Aemon refused not feeling himself suited for rule, but for service.  The Council ultimately named the youngest son of King Maekar as the next Targaryen monarch.  Egg had become King. Aegon The Unlikely, his moniker earned due to the circumstances that led him to become king, as a 4th son of a 4th son.  

On a side note, another claimant for the throne did come forward during the great council.  House Blackfyre was also represented in the council by a Aenys Blackfyre, fifth of Daemon I Blackfyre's sons.  Aenys wished to peacefully put forward his claim to the throne, and corresponded directly with the Hand of the King (Under Maekar) Brynden Rivers, aka Bloodraven to do so.  Bloodraven promised safe conduct for Aenys to enter Kings Landing and put forward his claim, but upon entering the city was arrested, thrown into the black cells, and later personally executed by Bloodraven himself.

At the very least, it will deplete the number of wights they have to fight later on.  Bare minimum, the plan would be a huge help.
 

With their small numbers, the Watch is doomed already.  It's hopeless.  But no one seems to notice that obvious fact except for Jon and Sam.

So what the hell is everyone's problem?  Alliser and all the rest are completely incapable of seeing reason, and it's becoming extremely unbelievable for me.  I understand they've been mindlessly fighting the wildlings forever, and the wildlings fought right back.  But people like Alliser's continued opposition to Jon's plan to help them survive via wildlings just totally breaks any suspense of disbelief for me.  

Am I the only one who is bothered by this, or do you think I am underestimating the hate the Watch feels towards wildlings?  It just feels so forced to me, and that even a dick like Alliser would HAVE to realize their horribly screwed situation at some point. 

If I'm crazy, please just let me know.  Cheers! :)

Whereas, in the show, which has had no problem depicting other characters as sexual objects, can see the larger form as only worthy of jokes. The framing of the blood Sam spilled right next to his wet forehead covered comically with sweat like a panting pig. Him not being able to breathe with a 90 pound woman on top of him except to wheeze out ""Oh Dearie Me"" - The image that came to mind with that much ridiculous politeness was Pooh Bear, instead of being a noble scene of sexual intercourse between equals I ended up laughing, and realized how the filmic language and editing had lured me into laughing at true courage and heroism.

I am either not getting something, or I missed an important detail in the show because this does not make any sense to me. A mostly show watcher here (reading GoT at the moment but have watched all the seasons) so please forgive me, but let me explain my theory. 

Lancel could not have been one of the ""boys"" LF gave up to either Cercei or Olenna. Lancel turned himself in prior to these events in order to join the Sparrows. That leaves just Olyvar. I am pretty sure LF gave Olyvar to Cercei in order for her to set-up Margaery in Loras' inquisition. Following that, LF speaks to Olenna and offers her another ""boy."" Am I remembering the timing of these events wrong because I am really confused by a lot of the comments stating Olyvar was given to Cercei, and Lancel was given to Olenna. Even some that suggest the opposite, which really wouldn't make any sense to me because why would Cercei then turn around and hand Lancel over to the Sparrows?

The timing, if correct, is not logical given when these boys were ""given"" and I am deducing that Olenna was not given Olyvar. Why would she then set-up her own grandchildren? Lancel gave himself up to join the Sparrows and was forgiven and his soul was cleansed. Cercei was ""given"" Olyvar. We are missing a third ""boy,"" the boy that was given to Olenna. A ""beautiful boy."" Is that LF's way of saying to he can give her Tommen? I am wondering if someone can answer whom can that be, or explain to me how I am getting it all wrong? I am sure I am not the only one that is a little bit confused by LF conniving ways. Thank you!",17,8,False,self,,,,,

Now I will get to Dany being the Mummers Dragon shortly, just a few other things need to be linked before this can work.

This theory will try to link Northern and Southern Ambitions (partly, these are quite massive theories and mine is relatively short), R + L = J, The Dragon Has Three Heads and Tyrion the Targaryen (this is where my change will occur). 

So, while the North were trying to over throw The Mad King through marriages (Hoster Tully even tried to marry Cat to two Starks, and another to an Arryn) and wards. The South were doing similar plans to strengthen their hold on the land but through child birth. This is where my change in the theories occur.

So, I do believe Tyrion to be a Targ, but Aerys is not the father. Rhaegar is. The pregnancy did not occur when Aerys commented on the Kings bedding rights being taken away. But this comment may have distracted Tywin when the real bedding took place. When Rhaegar went to inspect Cercei for betrothal. Now, he may have intentions of marrying Cerrcei, but she was too young at the time to conceieve and Rhaegars plan needed to be put forward immediately. So whilst Tywin was busy guarding Aerys, Rhaegar seduced Joanna and Tyrion was conceived. Aerys was known to be violent in bed, so marks would have been seen if it was him. But Rhaegar was sweet and gentle. 

I believe something like this as to why he seduced Lyanna Stark. But with Elia Martell, he was forced to have a legitimate child for an heir, and the Dornish were able to resist the Targaryens when they had dragons, so Aerys thought that was a smart match because he feared them. They defended themselves against dragons, Aerys had no dragons, so he gave them a queen.

Now why would he do this? When Rhaegar was crowned king, he would have Dorne by marriage, and his bastards next in line in Casterly Rock and Warden of the West and Winterfell and Warden of the North. Now both of these places had other Heirs. Casterly Rock had Jaime, until he was named to the Kings Guard, therefore his little brother (Rhaegars son) would be next in line. This would also have worked with Cercei. Aerys had all ready killed Neds father and brother, leaving one left to kill before Lyannas son would become heir. Rhaegar as king could have legitimized them, giving them proper claim to the lands even as bastards. He may have even used the Starks connection to The Vale to bring them totheir side, giving him family in all areas of his kingdom.

So there is the North, South, R + L = J and Tyrion the Targ theories linked. Now lets connect them to The Dragon Had 3 Heads and the Mummers Dragon. The 3 heads are referring to Rhaegars 3 sons, Tyrion, Jon and Aegon. Two bastards and one legitimate heir. He may have promised his father for a legitimate son. A prince who was promised. Yes, this part of the theory is weak, just basically naming the 3 heads.

Now where Dany becomes the Mummers Dragon. The evidence for this can be seen as the exact reasons Aegon is considered to b false. Dany was taken by Varys to Illyrio (who were Mummers) from the sack of Kings landing, and also the fact that if Aegon is indeed the true child of Rhaegar, then Danys claim to the Throne is indeed false, she may have been warned about her own situation. Dany was only warned of the Mummers Dragon, not who it was or if they would succeed.

Her role may be to only birth the dragons. She is the only Targ female, birthing is something a man cannot possibly do.

Now, how could the TV show (as of season 5 ep 7) not include Aegon? By not including the prophecy in the show. Something which they left out, it was filmed but left on the cutting room floor as to keep the characters of the show to a minimum. With no prophecy, Rhaegar does not need 3 sons.

And how could the book keep the same ending as the show? Aegon could die in battle, and with Jon and Tyrion as bastards, Dany would reclaim the Throne as she will have the strongest claim once again. She may even bind her dragon (before Aegon gets chance to and lends it to him, even using it herself is possible), with the other two being ridden by Jon and Tyrion. Or if the 3 sons do ride dragons, she might even reclaim Drogon with the same magic after Aegon dies. Dany could  marry Jon (who is used to leading the NW), with Tyrion as the Hand (a position he once held). So 3 Tararyens are running the kingdom to end the series.

Operation Blue involved the largest German force in a two pronged attack, one (mainly consisting the the German 6th army after it was striped of the 4th Panzer) was to attack Stalingrad, and was able to take parts of the city but ultimately defeated due a combination of the Russian winter, heavy resistance, and their supply lines failing.   
This parallels Stannis's efforts so far in my mind. His troops are marching towards a heavily defended position (Winterfell) against troops who know how to fight in the winter.   
&gt;""Us northerners know how to fight in frost""  Ramsay from ""the Gift""
  
Also we see Stannis's camp and none of his troops have fur or other clothes designed for winter, as Davos reports casualties to Stannis due to the Winter, yet Stannis is determined to push ahead in spite of Davos's advice.

As we can see from [This map](http://barbariana.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Map2-2_Map_of_Westeros_Original.jpg) that (assuming Stannis is following the Kings road) Stannis is vulnerable to having his supply line back to Castle Black being cut off by a secondary force coming from the Dreadfort while Stannis tries to take Winterfell.   
Ultimately I think the attack on Winterfell will happen at the end of the season but that won't be the end of it. Winter is setting in and even if Stannis manages to drive Ramsay out of Winterfell his men are tired and cold with very little supplies left, Roose Bolton is still around with a new heir on the way, and Stannis may have to sacrifice those close to him to stay alive via red magic  
  
**TLDR** Winterfell will be Stannis's Stalingrad",14,10,False,self,,,,,

I personally don't think it was Lancel as surely he would have already confessed his sins to the High sparrow. So what if it's Gendry? My hype/theory is undoubtedly wrong as Gendry is on the island of Lost but what if LF is giving him to Olenna as a way to prove Cersei's incest crimes to the high sparrow. LF pointed him out to Ned in the first place so he knows who his father is and his worth. If LF gave him to Olenna she would undoubtedly use it against Cersei causing havoc in the capital between Lannister, Tyrell and the legitimacy of the king. (Only problem is that this would lead to Margaery no longer being queen so would Olenna actually do it?)
So LF's big picture plan: 
Stark have pretty much been removed in his eyes (except Sansa who he thinks he can recover again).
Baratheon and Bolton are about to fight it out in the north and spend their armies.
Lannister and Tyrell are at each other's throats and he knows that without Tywin to control the Lannisters, he can easily push them to full conflict causing havoc in the capital.
Tully are pretty much gone and if it were following Jaime's story in the books we would know this for sure.
So since LF controls the armies of the Vale (which are still intact), he could easily just wait for the remaining houses to destroy each other and then swoop in afterwards, using Sansa to control the north and the Vale armies to conquer the rest. As Varys said ""he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes"". The only formidable force left would be the Martell's , so I'm interested to see if he'll get involved with them in any way soon. Gendry being his gift to Olenna probably wont happen but I still believe he's scheming for a Lannister/Tyrell fist fight. This is all nothing new I'm sure but I found it fun to come to conclusions just from my own knowledge for once. Feel free to poke holes or add insight, would love to read other people's ideas.

I think if this is true the show will reveal it when Meryn Trant arrives in Braavos and Arya finds out and tries to kill him after fatally wounding him he will reveal that he did not actually kill Syrio and that Syrio escaped.

Littlefinger is suspiciously oblique in referring to his gift only as a ""handsome young man. As far I as I can recall, it's never explicitly established that he's talking about Lancel or that Lady Olenna has anything to do with Lancel's confession to the High Sparrow.

Given the absence of any prior indication that Lancel was protecting Cersei and his rather conspicuous fanaticism, it seems probable that he would have told the High Sparrow about his affair with Cersei well before Littlefingers meeting with Lady Olenna. If so, that secret was already set to bite Cersei in the ass without their intervention.

If all that is the case, then might Littlefinger be offering up Robin to entice the Tyrells into an alliance or even just to tempt them into open rebellion against the Lannisters?",27,5,False,self,,,,,

This (the televised version of something speeding past the written form) has happened before, such as with Fullmetal Alchemist/FMA Brotherhood. Is there any chance that there would be a remaking of the show once the books are done since there is such deviation occurring? What about the likelihood of it being remade in an animated form? Has there already been discussion of this?

Issues: I think that remaking the show or later seasons, at least, to strictly adhere to the books would do nothing but make more money. But considering how many young actors are important in the show, they certainly couldn't use the same actors (though that hasn't been much of an issue for GoT so far). Also, animated media, such as in the style of anime, is a pretty niche market as compared to standard HBO live action television. I suggested that it would be much more likely to be done as a graphic novel remake, but then discovered that already started happening in 2012.

Ok good.
The last episode we saw Ghost save Sam which means that Jon left him at Castle Black. I started to think about how stupid that was since he is going into enemy territory (again) and should probably have all the protection that he can get. I started thinking about it for a bit and then I realized why. In the books and season 1 Bran almost gets killed but lives only because summer was there. In book 3 when Rob arrives at the Twins Gray Wind starts to act hostile towards the Freys so Rob locks him in the kennels and then..........
Now In book 5 Ghost starts acting similarly hostile towards Jon's brothers of the Nights Watch so he locks him up in his room and then..............
What I am getting at is that the Direwolfs are the Stark Children's protectors and they can only be killed when they are separated from their Direwolfs which pretty much confirms that Jon will be killed by the end on this season.

So this might sound a bit crazy and I admit that I am propably digging too far into the Series, because I obviously have too much time and am absolutely obsessed with Game of Thrones.

As we all know, GRRM uses many historical events in his Series which inspired him for a lot of strategical moves, Religions and other in ASOIAF. So I thaught about Stannis and what his historical equivalent could be. Last Episode [S5 E7], when we saw Stannis resting at his camp and talking with Davos about his men and their conditions, it suddenly seemed so obvious. The march for Winterfell is obviously an alliteration for the march of Germany towards Russia in the second world war. The big german army (stannis has a lot of men) marches to victory (or defeat) and gets brutally striken by the arctic winter, which they have never experienced before and are therefore totally unprepared, unlike the boltons (Russians in my theory) who always lived in the north and are totally prepared for winter. But that is not the only hint for my theory. The realm (the Viewers) think Stannis is the mannis, he is the true Savior of our World (Westeros) and we all follow him, because he is a great leader. There is a similarity between us (the viewers) and the german from before WW2, who thought hitler was the good guy, which they would later regret. Concerning religion, Hitler was very extreme and only accepted one true god -&gt; The god of Light it was I think ;)... and everyone who has another Religion shall be burned alive. Stannis is the one true King of Westeros, whom everyone should follow, there is no place for any other King or Person with might, just like hitler thought he was for our world. Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fhrer (One People, One Realm, One Leader)-&gt; German political Slogan in WW2 One Realm, One Religion, One King -&gt; Stannis Baratheon The Part from one of the last Episodes, where Stannis repeatedly corrects ""less"" into ""fewer"" could also be a hint, as those people who correct every little mistake are called grammar nazis on the internet. (Dont take this part of the theory too serious)

I admit, that this theory is pretty far fetched, but it has some ground to it and I am totaly convinced, that every little scene in Game of Thrones has its Purpose, that is the one thing I have learned from watching season 1-4 about 4 times already. What do you guys think about this? I think this subreddit is the perfect Place for such theories (I mean we already had the time travleing Fetus?!) This is just my little theory, of which I had never heard anywhere before (No Political motivation or anything just a theory of someone who absolutely loves Game of Thrones)

If we all bombard that subreddit with anti bolton posts(on the same time that is), surely they will bend the knee. They will songs about how we destroyed r/Dreadfort. 

If you read this r/Dreadfort, there is no point in running. There is no point in hiding. We will be there. Sooner than you think.

Stannis calls Robb an usurper since he claims himself to be the king in the north, but it was pretty clear to me that his main motivation was not the iron throne but revenge against the Lannisters. I don't think Robb was even considering Stannis as the heir but I think if Stannis had sent a raven or some messenger asking for the Stark house to ally against them Robb would have said yes in a heartbeat.



I don't know... it could have been a series of misfortunate events and bad communication but if Stannis is so just and calculating wouldn't a warning to stop the claim and join forces (as he did with Renly) would have been appropriate for his character? After all they were fighting against the same enemies, it seems like a bit of an oversight for me.

Maybe the books address it better? If Robb per example didn't mind about the iron throne (he seems reluctant to call himself king at first) but then vanity got the best of him and he starts thinking ""well, King Robb doesn't sound shabby"" it would have been more natural to have him denying Stannis claim... I don't remember if we got any sort of interaction between both characters on the tv series.",42,23,False,self,,,,,

**Okay.  Starting with the very end:**  
The obvious is that I think E10 will end with a fade to black after a certain death.  All the show watchers will turn to their book-reader friends and shout ""TELL US!!?!?"" and the readers will look down and whisper ""I don't know.""  Honestly, I can't wait.  

**To the East:**  
I think we'll see the last of Dany for the season in E09.  That will likely give Tyrion a chance to prove his loyalty, but I'm curious as to how that will play out.  Any ideas?

**Varys:**  
In the epilogue of ADWD, we see Varys show up and stick a knife in a particular back.  The problem is that the show hasn't really portrayed that back to be very important.  I suspect that we'll see a visit with the High Sparrow instead.

**To the (sort of) North:**
I'd like to say that Theon gets partial redemptions as he helps Sansa escape, but I don't think she ends up going toward Stannis as they need to get her back on the book's story arc.  Most likely, Brienne and Pod bring her back to where she's supposed to be.  Even if that place is with Littlefinger.  I think we're going to see the Iron Islands come back into play next season and Theon will likely end up King eventually there (after paying the Iron Price for his own name), but it's hard to predict when he's going to need to be involved with that, so I have no idea which direction he heads after Winterfell.

**Arya:**  
I think Arya will get to cross Meryn Trant off her list, and it makes the most sense to do it during the whole travelling show bit leaked from Book 6.  The problem is that I feel like her blind stint as Cat should probably come first, and there's just not much time for that.

Anyhow, 

I just started a **A Feast for Crows** and **Dance with Dragons** at the same time with this [chapter order here](http://boiledleather.com/post/24543217702/a-proposed-a-feast-for-crows-a-dance-with-dragons). I was pretty skeptical, but it actually is working out great! Wasn't sure if anyone else has tried this (I'm sure I'm super behind on the band wagon here). 

I don't want to go as far as I 'hated' **A Feast for Crows**, but it definitely wasn't my favorite of the books. I remember it introduced a lot of new POV characters I didn't really care about. The whole start of it isn't at disorienting as it was the first time too. No Tyrion annoyed me, but diving into Cersei's crazed head for the first time was a great experience though. Made up for it. 

Has anyone else given the books another go at one-point-or-another and tried this? Or any major parts that you enjoyed more your 2nd+ time(s) through all the books?

ASoS is the best book ever. Reading AFfC and ADwD at the same time is amazing. Victarion Greyjoy is OP. Forgot how much George likes his food/banner details.

I just started **A Feast for Crows** and **Dance with Dragons** at the same time with [this chapter order here](http://boiledleather.com/post/24543217702/a-proposed-a-feast-for-crows-a-dance-with-dragons). I was pretty skeptical, but it actually is working out great! Wasn't sure if anyone else has tried this (I'm sure I'm super behind on the band wagon here).
I don't want to go as far as I 'hated' **A Feast for Crows**, but it definitely wasn't my favorite of the books. I remember it introduced a lot of new POV characters I didn't really care about. The whole start of it isn't at disorienting as it was the first time too. No Tyrion annoyed me, but diving into Cersei's crazed head for the first time was a great experience though. Made up for it.

Has anyone else given the books another go at one-point-or-another and tried this? Or any major parts that you enjoyed more your 2nd+ time(s) through all the books?


**tl;dr**

**ASoS** is the best book ever. Reading **AFfC** and **ADwD** at the same time is amazing. Victarion Greyjoy is OP. Forgot how much George likes his food/banner details. Breasts. ",9,15,False,self,,,,,

This last one gained a lot of traction and thanks to /u/Cheerwines I was able to go back through both trailers and grab more screenshots of stuff that was discussed as well as a few that weren't mentioned. Here is the gallery: http://imgur.com/a/f04RM

I'd like to point out that in image 1, Tyrion is not in the circle.

Image 2: There is a lot of smoke coming from the stands and the crowd seems dispersed/dead for the most part. 

Image 3: Jorah in the pits. I saw that he in fact is in there with a huge crowd so there's that...probably fighting for Dany's acceptance. 

Image 4: well...fuck

Image 7: Black arms breaking through wood. I would like to think White Walkers? But I can't tell for sure...there was dragonglass last episode though

And the final image does in fact show Selyse is in fact crying in the snow while looking up as if she is getting left behind ",26,14,False,self,,,,,

I still think this season is decent but a more Cersei, Tyrion, Arianne Martell/Sandsnakes focused season seems like such a more obvious direction to go. Cersei's character arc in the books is sooo good. She final gets all the power she wants and slowly destroys herself through vengeful bitchy decisions, this is so cool because its a characters own flaws destroying them. For Tyrion, his whole odyssey on the river boat I think should have been included and would have been ten times better than the short little B.S. trip he had with Jorah Mormont. And last Arianne's whole love affair with Ser Aerys Oakheart and the conspiracy they come up with to kidnap Myrcella would have been awesome! So, all around I think the writers missed huge chances for this season to have way more depth and not just feel like a bunch of filler. The seasons not over so we'll see how it plays out but I'm interested to see if anyone else felt that they are totally blowing it? And I'm ok with things being cut out I'm no snob when it comes to how closely they follow the books but man sure feels like they missed out on some amazing story telling. ",15,1,False,self,,,,,

I don't necessarily believe this is going to happen, but I do think it should. Bare with me for this. If you have reasons why this shouldn't, couldn't, or wouldn't happen, I'd love feedback. 

Selyse speaks to Melisandre sometime in the upcoming episodes. She is told that to win this battle in the snow, Shireen will need to be sacrificed. Selyse takes it into her own hands after being denied by Stannis. It's a mother's mercy kill. Stannis leaves the bitch in the snow on his way to Winterfell. The sacrifice, however, helps Stannis' cause. Get HYPE for the Brotherhood without Banners. They show up and help defeat the Boltons. Stannis kills Ramsey and Thoros kills Roose. Quite a showdown. HYPE HYPE. Melisandre was right all along. She walks in the snow as the Bolton banners are taken down with a smile on her face. Stannis sees her face. Stannis is a believer. Stannis couldn't leave her if he tried. 

 While this is happening, Brienne is still looking into that damned window. Derp derp, no candle. A hooded woman finds Brienne not doing a God Damned thing and asks her about her oath. She reveals herself as LSH, absolves her of her oath and gives her a new one... Bring me Jaime Lannister. The battle is over, but there's one thing LSH needs to take care of... the dog who's actions lost the war and her eldest son, as well as killed her two youngest. She finds Theon who had been protecting Sansa from the battle. In Sansa's eyes he has redeemed himself just a little bit. But LSH knows no mercy. All we see is Sansa in the shot. Crying and terrified like Reek was in 'that one scene'. Blood sprays all over her horrified face. (The blood spray reminds me of the end of a certain wedding). Blood drips out of Theons neck as he lay on the ground. 

LSH turns to a bruised and beaten Sansa and says, ""Don't stress yourself, my child. Stress can kill a pregnancy."" Mother's Mercy.

And even if Tywin doesn't like it, Tyrion is part of his family, and part of his legacy. When Tyrion is captured by Catelyn, Tywin starts a war to get him back. Then, when it becomes clear that Jaime will probably dies at the hands of the northmen, he tries to transform Tyrion into a good heir : he names him hand of the king, then master of coins, and then marries him to one of the most beautiful and (potentialy) powerful women in the seven kingdoms : Sansa.

So even if Tywin despises Tyrion, he still put his duty before his personnal interests and even slowlu accept that Tyrion will be his legacy. But then Jaime comes back and Tywin can finally get rid of Tyrion, right ? Well, no, as I said, Tywin would never risk losing a member of his family just because he hates him, and he has a lot of important things to worry about as the hand, so why would he take time and efforts to get Tyrion killed ? 

My theory is that Tywin never wanted Tyrion to die, Tyrion's trial was all part of his plan to have Jaime leave the Kingsguard and become heir to Casterly Rock. Then of course Tyrion messes his father's plans by demanding a trial by combat, and Tywin sees no reason to save him, but he never actually schemed to kill him.",43,4,False,self,,,,,

Honestly with the name of the final episode of S5 released (Mother Mercy), and the casting calls for next season showing the revival of the Ironborn, I'm pretty hyped about them reviving Lady Stoneheart's plot line.

When Lena posted the Stone Heart she made on Instagram it was right when the cast received season 5 scripts, people have stated that the finale will ""break the internet,"" and with them delaying the Iron Born plot this far I don't think it's inconceivable that they would do the same with LSH. It wouldn't have made sense to reveal her at the end of S4 with nothing about her happening this season, but with them bringing some plots to a close soon and the fact that Brienne + Pod + Jaime's plotlines still haven't finished I'm pretty much set that she will be back.

If she doesn't come back I will eat a picture of David Benioff and DB Weiss and then wash it down with a weiner of some kind and upload it to Youtube as punishment for letting myself get hyped about something in this show.",107,87,False,self,,,,,

I'm just a show watcher, so my predictions are based on that. I've made a post about some of this before, but I think I labeled it with the wrong spoiler tags. I know people will make arguments for why certain things can't happen, I'll do my best to convince. Here it is...

I think that the ""handsome young man"" that Littlefinger will give to Olenna is Gendry. It makes no sense for it to be Olyvar or Lancel. 

Olyvar first...

&gt;BAELISH: Cersei summoned me to Kings Landing. I dared not refuse her.

&gt;OLENNA: And what did she want?

&gt;BAELISH: A piece of information that she knew that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.

&gt;OLENNA: What kind of gift?

&gt;BAELISH: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.


Littlefinger, in his riddle, states that..

A) ""I had a piece of information that she knew that I had.""

B) ""but I have other information of which she is unaware.""

C) ""A handsome young man"" 

Not ""THE"" handsome young man. 

This clearly indicates that her gift is not Olyvar. What good could Olyvars testimony do again? He's already testified to The High Sparrow. Is he going to claim that he perjured himself the first time, because Cersei threatened him? Not likely. It wouldn't work. 

Now Lancel...

How could Littlefinger possibly give Lancel to Olenna as a gift? He's a devout member of The Sparrows. He's not going to do any favors for the most notorious flesh peddler in The Seven Kingdoms, or the old, decadently rich woman who's grandson is into ""buggary "". He's already threatened Littlefinger. Lancel has nothing to hide at this point...

&gt;HIGH SPARROW: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird.

&gt;Cersei gives a faint laugh.

&gt;HIGH SPARROW: And he has much to say about you.

&gt; Lancel enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.

It's clear that after The Battle of Blackwater, Lancel met The High Sparrow and told him everything. He told him about his affair with Cersei, and the conspiracy to kill King Robert. After Tywins death, it opened the door for The Sparrows to enter Kings Landing for the first time since before Aegon, where they started manipulating Cersei with plans to take the capital back ""for the people"".

Now that I've made my case for why I think the ""handsome young man"" isn't Olyvar or Lancel, I'll make my case for Gendry..

The last time we saw Gendry he was getting put on a boat by Ser Davos and instructed to row to Kings Landing. Is it a stretch to think that he could have ended up in The Eerie instead? It's just as close as Kings Landing, and Gendry clearly wasn't experienced on a boat. If he ended up in The Eerie, is it a stretch to think that he could have told his story to someone, and that the story could make its way to the leaders of The Vale and Littlefinger? Littlefinger could use his many resources to find evidence of Gendry's claim as the only living heir of Robert Baratheon. Many people witnessed one of Roberts bastards being killed in Littlefingers brothel by Janos Slynt. Many others were witness to the City Watch who were hunting down ""a bastard named Gendry"" when he was heading towards The Wall with Arya and Yoren in season 2. Stannis knew Gendry was Roberts bastard just by looking at his eyes...

http://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Stannis-major-gif.gif

If Littlefinger has possession of Gendry, and the Tyrells could present him to The High Sparrow with evidence of his bloodline, a very strong case can be made for his claim to The Iron Throne.

Now that I've made my case against Olyvar and Lancel, and for Gendry being ""the handsome young man"", here are my wild and crazy predictions, both short term...and long.. 

Again, just a show watcher...

Cersei will be found guilty of adultery,  and kingslaying based on Lancels testimony. She will also be found guilty of incest. All of the evidence that Ned and Jon Aryn had uncovered before she and Joffrey took the throne will finally be used. Pycelle will snitch on them. She will be punished with exile from Kings Landing, and Tommen will be delegitimized as a bastard of incest with zero kings blood and will also be exiled. Because Cersei is captive, and because of Tommens lack of backbone to free her by force with his Kings Guard, he will have no choice but to accept it and return to Casterly Rock with his mother. The Lannisters are all gone from Kings Landing now. 

After asking for The Mothers Mercy, Margaery and Loras will be exiled for their crimes of buggary(for Loras) and perjury(for both). Loras will go to Highgarden to be The Lord of Highgarden someday after Mace. Olenna will then give Gendry to The High Sparrow and ask that he annul Tommen and Margaerys marriage so that Margaery isn't forced to go to Casterly Rock with the delegitimized Lannister bastard and Cersei. Margaery will also go back to Highgarden. It's what Olenna wants, to have her grandchildren in Highgarden, and out of that foul smelling nest of vipers that is Kings Landing. It's also part of the grander conspiracy with Littlefinger. 

Why would the powers that be want to make Gendry King?

From Littlefingers perspective, Gendry is a clean slate. He's big, strong, and handsome. Littlefingers been in possession of him since he got off that boat, and he's had plenty of time to mold him and teach him about how to play the game of thrones, as he's also done with Sansa. He has money, soldiers, a lordship, and big clout to impress him. He's obviously very persuasive. 

From The High Sparrows perspective, Gendry is a lowborn bastard of a whore. A king for the people. Someone from Flea Bottom who believes in The 7. The High Sparrow, like Littlefinger, is also very persuasive.

The Faith Militant legitimizes King Gendry of House Baratheon, first of his name, King of the Andals, yada yada etc...

He's put on The Iron Throne.  

The Faith Militant and Littlefinger will now vie for influence with King Gendry...

To the surprise of The Faith Militant, Gendry names Littlefinger Hand of the King. They didn't even know he was involved because Gendry was handed to them by the Tyrells. Littlefinger outsmarts them, as he always does. After naming his Small Council and his Kings Guard(all decided by LF) King Gendry and Littlefinger will drive The Faith Militant out of Kings Landing by force. In the beginning this will make things politically very rocky with the common people for the new King, but ultimately he will win them over with his lowborn and humble perspective. Also, with Littlefinger as Hand, the whore houses will be booming.

What about Stannis? 

Is his claim stronger than Gendry's? Maybe, but the Faith Militant would never support his claim because of his perceived worship of The Red God, and his burning of The Seven in The Red Lady's fires. And Stannis is really far away, stuck in the northern winter.

I predict that Stannis will reject The Red Lady once and for all, and go back to the traditional Baratheon sigil. Melisandre will ride for The Wall, taking the devout members of R'hllor with her. When Stannis is busy dealing with the Boltons, and the weather, Selsye will kidnap Shereen and take her to The Wall. They will burn her alive beyond The Wall before Jon gets back from Hardhome. The magic will have great consequence.

This will break Stannis emotionally. He will send soldiers to capture Melisandre and Selsye. Only Selsye will be captured and Stannis will behead her for treason. Stannis will get word that Gendry has been made King. A broken man, who no longer has an heir, and not wanting to kill his own blood again, Stannis will bend the knee to King Gendry. He will do his duty, as Renly did not do for him. Gendry will make Stannis the Lord of Storms End, as King Robert did not. Stannis will do his duty. He will smash the Boltons and take The North for King Gendry. He will Smash the Freys at The Twins and take The Riverlands. He will exact all revenge due for The Red Wedding, building an alliance with the remaining Starks.

House Lannister will be weak and bend the knee.
The Tyrells will bend the knee.
Thanks to Stannis, The North, The Riverlands, and Storms End will all bend the knee.
Littlefinger will have Robin Aryn and The Vale bend the knee.
Dorne? Maybe not. 

Gendry ""The Bastard King"" will unite six of the seven kingdoms. 

But oops, while that was all happening, the burning of Shereen triggered the war with the White Walkers. They will march south and slaughter everyone in their path.

Oops, while all of that was happening, Tyrion convinced Danerys to finally go to Westeros where they will start in Dorne and march north. Of course, they could sale around the south west part right into Casterly Rock too. 

Collision course. 

Thoughts? Haha.

I have a feeling brienne could ruin something great between Stannis and Sansa. He offered Jon the chance to rule Winterfell therefore you can only imagine the same thing will be offered to Sansa. 

I could see Theon helping Sansa escape and bringing her to Stan who will offer her the chance to rule, only to have Brienne sneak in and kill Stanis and get Sansa out of there.

A few good ones (Ramsay and Joffrey, Jon and Jaime etc)

One of the ones that was particularly interesting was if Dany met Roose Bolton. 

* They both have beasts supposedly under there command (Ramsay and the Dragons). Both of which were useful when taking over but aren't as useful for ruling and retaining control (if anything are more problematic). They both feel compelled to look after them after a sense of family. They both indiscriminately cause damage and chaos that has to be cleaned up.

* They both married for alliances (kinda standard for the time)

* Both betrayed there supposed ruler/better in order to stay with there new alliance (Dany with the Dothraki and Roose witht he crown)

* Both are willing to use cruel methods to meet their ends (flaying and burning the masters with the dragons)

I feel like this sentiment completely misses the point of the story.  Sure doing nothing isn't the solution either, but isn't the overall theme of the entire story that drastic violent action always has terrible consequences?

I also don't really understand the virulent Sparrow hate.  The way I see it, this is what they've been up to since they showed up in King's Landing:

- Feed the poor.
- Convinced some lordlings ie Lancel to give up their titles and join.
- Brought the hammer down on drinkin' and whorin'.
- Persecuted homosexuals.
- Made some arrrests, targeted at the rich and powerful.

So of 5 major acts, only the homophobia strikes me as particularly reprehensible, and only by our sensibilities.  The Sparrows in the show definitely fall into the ""antagonist"" category, but ""storm in and murder everyone inside a religious building"" seems way too extreme.

Though I don't like that D&amp;D added the homophobia bit to the show Sparrows, overall I think they're a good addition.  Literally nobody else that I can think of, not even the honorable Starks has ever given two shits about how their actions have affected the common people.  Everything has been about ""my rights"" and ""my family"" which hI'm not complaining has been great, but the Sparrows are a fresh perspective and I like it.",40,16,False,self,,,,,

She has a skewed sense if justice, she doesn't understand politics at all, and she let's her emotions get the better of her judgement. You could says she's just in need of the proper advisers like Tyrion, but it's obvious she needs A LOT of counsel, and anyone who needs that much help to rule isn't exactly ""chosen one"" material. Plus even if she did have the right counsel, we've seen her foolishly disregard their advice before.

Unless the story is heading in a direction where Daenerys ends up being a major antagonist and takes after her father, I can't say I'm a fan of her character and story arc at all.

I strongly think that this TV Show has gone from watchable to bad. I mean it never was the best out there but it kept my interest all 4 seasons and I pretty much like it.

But now once the season 5 (I've hardy got to episode 4) has started I just can't stand it anymore, I just get bored (I've even fast forward though some scenes) and tired of all the boring plot - I couldn't care less for Aria, Sansa or that ""one true king"" who keeps saying that every damn episode.

Also I strongly believe that the Game of Thrones by Telltale has a better written story than this TV show in season 5 which is shameful considering that Telltale Games's budget isn't anywhere close to the Game of Thrones's one.

From what I've heard starting from season 5 Game of Thrones has gone way off the books and this may be the reason why it has become so freaking predicable.

I mean, what happened with that unpredictable TV Show where you'd remain amazed with your mouth open for a good 5 minutes by the sudden death of Eddard Stark or the bloody death of Robb Start from The Red Wedding?

He established himself through his ability to make money and then worked his way onto the kings council. But why? He positioned himself there so he is close enough to the top to have influence or more specifically close enough to be able to orchestrate the chaos that will bring the iron throne crumbling down. Whilst everyone else has been fighting over their claim to the throne, he has been creating a shift in power that no one else has seemed to notice. The North is now where the true power will reside, he is creating a situation in kings landing where there is no obvious claim to the throne, there is no order and therefore there is no power. ""What did I once tell you about the capital, were all liars here"" He see's king landing as a joke, it has no meaning to him, the realm is a ""lie"" and he is only playing his ""role"" their whilst he's moved towards his true aim. Baelish has spent so long in kings landing they have forgotten his strong ties to the north(""if people don't know who you are or what you want they don't know what you plan to do next"") all this time it has been his aim to make the North mighty again with him at the top and he is very close to actualising this; Cersi has just willingly handed over one of the final pieces over to him (Winterfell), without even realising the magnitude of what's happening. He's on the brink of having everything he wants; Sanza and being the most powerful man in Westeros.  Now, as for what happens to him realistically you'd have to say things will fall apart and I can think of two ways of it happening. ""Knowledge is power"" is one of Balieshe's main philosophies and ironically says at one point ""it's usually what we don't know that gets us killed"", he has a plan for everything yet it will be something unforeseen that will be his undoing; This isn't something that could happen very easily though. Baelish is master of making sure he can see all the pieces and plans his move for every eventuality, however, he is a logical and practical man and therefore there is something he has no plan for... Dragons. Rather that or he could end up blinded by love (like he was with Caitlyn) and end up being killed by Sanza which would be ironic since he would have played a large part in her becoming strong and calculated enough to pull it off.

If the Meereenese were so concerned with respect for their traditions, where were the howls of protest when the Unsullied desecrated the giant Harpy? Why the emphasis solely on reopening the pits?

My theory/prediction: 

What do we know about the Meereenese Masters? They are wealthy but few in number. While some may be skilled at combat, they cannot hope to win a war of attrition against superior numbers. The Sons of the Harpy may have succeeded in ambushing a few Unsullied, but Daenery is unpredictable and impatient and her eye-for-an-eye approach is well-known. She'll run out of patience long before they can make a dent in her numbers, and at that point she might execute all the Masters. 

What the Sons of the Harpy have, presumably, is wealth and connections, and what they need is a way to swell their numbers quickly. Every successful insurgency needs foot soldiers. The Masters are too few in number, too important, and too identifiable. They may have collaborators within the ranks of the former slaves, but large-scale recruitment is too risky. They need to look outside of Meereen, but the Unsullied control the gates. Smuggling may work, to an extent, but it won't scale. What they need is a pretext to bring significant numbers of trained, unaffiliated fighters into Meereen, with or without the aid of outside sympathizers. Reopening the fighting pits is a trojan horse. 

Now that the Sons of the Harpy have the means to swell their insurgency, they need only look for opportunities. Daenerys and her inner circle are too well-protected in the pyramid. The Sons of the Harpy employ guerilla tactics in order to give themselves local superiority in numbers. The games provide a perfect opportunity to lure Daenerys out of her stronghold and into an environment where her personal guard could be surrounded and overwhelmed. When she attended the opening games she was sitting on a dais surrounded by Masters and dozens, perhaps hundreds, of armed sellswords, all of whom have questionable allegiances. Remember that Hizdar has been urging her to make the rounds of the fighting pits so that the fighters can pay her the honor of her presence. 

Remember also that Daario said that a dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen. I think Daenerys erred badly when she brought the Masters, suspected leaders of the insurgency, into the room where her dragons are chained up and confined and allowed them to leave with this knowledge. Any beast, no matter how fearsome, can be killed in a cage, as the Freys did with Robb's direwolf. The Sons of the Harpy could use a diversion elsewhere (such as the fighting pits) to attack her vulnerable dragons.

If they succeed the Masters don't need to kill her, that might even be counter-productive. They can hold her hostage under house arrest, using her to control the slaves and Unsullied while ruling in her name through Hizdar or another proxy.

I've been wondering about the 5x7 scene of Ghost saving Sam's ass in the last moment... and I couldn't help to wonder if that was just a lucky coincidence, or if there was something else in there. I thought that maybe Bran was warging Ghost and decided to help Sam because he will be important to the story somehow. And derived of that, I wondered if Bran has been ""acting behind the curtains"" this whole season. These are some moments in which Bran could be involved:


*Drogon visiting Dany when she was feeling down

*Drogon hanging out in Valirya for no aparent reason (probably researching Dragonglass or something, I have the feeling that will be important)

*Controlling the Hodor-like dude that broke Tyrion's chains (again, because he's important for the story)

*As I said before, saving Sam's life with Ghost

*Making Pod's horse going all crazy.


As a prediction, I can see a S6 episode recalling some events from S5, but from ""Bran's perspective"", A.K.A, the animals (and maybe people) he may be warging.
The fact that the Three-Eyed Raven said to him that he would ""fly"" (on the S4 season finale) made me think that Bran will become some sort of pseudo omni-present being, or some sort of ""puppet master"" in some aspects of the story.

I know all of this sounds like a stretch, but with this show, you never know. Any thoughts you guys have on this?

He was a competent fighter and lover.  Men and Women both wanted to be him and be with him.

He's traveled all over Westeros, earned links at the Citadel in Old Town, gained military experience in wars of the Free Cities, and rekt brothels west and east.  Arguments could be made that he made the eight.

After a mountain fell on him we are left with his legacy: a vengeance filled paramour and three immature daughters.

So, tossing this out there for reddit discussion and consensus building:

.

His daughters, although arguably not well done on the show are still Obyeryn's daughters and could represent what he was like before he experienced the world and found the love of his life.  They each seem have an aspect of his character.

The Sand Snake's cringe worthy sharp corners have yet to be smoothed off by life's triumphs and tragedies.  They have idolized certain of their father's traits without understanding that it was what Oberyn wouldn't do (kill little girls, etc) that kept him from being a monster and made us like him all the more.

I don't know, maybe a little less fightin and fuckin round da world and more time spent raising the Sand Snakes?  We only see him after he leaves Dorne and comes to King's Landing so it's hard to say what he did or didn't do for them, we only know he didn't outright abandon them.

It's easy to argue that the way D&amp;D portrayed them sucked but I haven't seen many arguments as to why they did so.  (Other than time and money constraints)

.

Now that we've had time (and titties) to think what say you reddit?

I was trying to picture some of the standout fight moments and one came to me that could lead to a very interesting chain of events leading up to how Jon's fate plays out in the show towards his alleged parentage and role in the end game. 

The white walkers attack the wildlings and we get to really see how devastating they are in open combat. I see a few of them grabbing hapless defenders and turning them into free folkscicles. One of them sets upon Jon and tries to do this to him, however for some reason Jon does not turn, the walker stares blankly at Jon while by reflex he swings either Longclaw or one of the dragonglass daggers and dispatches it. If R+L=J is correct his fire half would not be so easily frozen. 

Returning to Castle Black and what happens eventually happens they say the words over Jon's body and then set him afire. His clothes burn, but he does not. While everyone just stares in disbelief the season's last shot is a closeup of Jon's eyes opening surrounded by flame. The fire not only would fail to burn him, but it would bring him back. When Jorah recounted the tale of Dany not burning in the fire and bringing life back to the dragon eggs to Tyrion recently, it started me thinking about other things that this could be foreshadowing. It seems they can't mention anything in this show without using it to lead up to something else happening very soon. 
Rebirth directly by fire could also happen with or without the involvement of Melisandre because of dragon blood. 

Whatever happens I'm very excited to see it play out on the screen over the next few weeks. I was having a discussion with a friend and if they do kill Jon this season and he is supposed to come back, seeing him on the cast list for next season would ruin the surprise. So if they do it, they have to bring him back quickly or save the event for Season 6. ",8,4,False,self,,,,,

I knew Melisandre wanted to use him for things, but didn't realize Stannis was cool with that. I just figured he respected Jon and wanted him to avenge his family out of honor and all those things Stannis stands for. Thanks in advance for answering.",1,1,False,default,,,,,

As I was doing some work around my house today my mind wandered to the Red Wedding. At the time I was devastated, obviously, but I knew something had to happen to the Starks because their plotline had been forced into a corner. They would never have won the war against the Lannisters and something had to be done with them. And so it did.

With all of the plotlines that have to be tied up and/or together with where the show is right now I have an idea of how it will all happen. First of all, Stannis (the Mannis)'s character has been developed far more in this season and he has made it clear that he is going to make a major move or two before winter officially comes. He will move onto Winterfell and win because the Boltons are weak and he is desperate for victory. He will then ally with Sansa and secure the North (for the time being). 

With Cersei and the future of the Tyrells in dungeons it would be (admittedly a little too) easy to wrap up their plotlines with execution/indefinite imprisonment. Tommen has no spine or worthy advisers. He will be outted as a child of incest through the torture of Cersei/Jaime trying to free Cersei. Cersei will continue to be imprisoned/will be exiled in spite of this forced cooperation. With the Lannisters neutered and the Tyrells becoming a house with a head but no body, King's Landing will descend into anarchy with no powerful ruling dynasty. 

That is, until Stannis takes his rightful place upon the Iron Throne.

Just in time for winter/dragons and the end of the season.

I don't know if I believe this myself, but I could see it happening and it's fun to speculate. I'm sure I'll enjoy finding out why I'm wrong, so please tell me what you think.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Some of these include

-A mad king. Henry VI was mentally unstable, and many people hated him. Aerys II Targaryen is often referred to as ""The Mad King"", Henry VI was kept alive in imprisonment to avoid having his son rule, and became the last of his line. Aerys Targaryen was considered mad and became less and less popular until infamously being slain by or Ser Jamie ""Kingslayer"" Lannister. Both deaths started wars; Henry VI's started the Wars of the Roses, while Aerys Targaryen's started Robert Baratheon's rule and Robert's Rebellion. 

-Edmund of Langley, First Duke of York, was involved with the capture of Henry VI. Once Henry VI was killed, he returned to England to become Protector of England, but never actually claimed the throne. Eddard Stark fought in wars with Robert Baratheon, and became Hand of the King and Lord of Winterfell, but refused to style himself as a king. 

I don't have time to pull up everything, but did Martin ever mention that he was basically writing the Wars of the Roses? What other similarities do the two have? What characters are which? I'm trying to figure out how deep it runs, which houses are which, and so on. I know that GRRMartin said he was inspired by medieval dynastic power changes, but is he specifically writing the War of the Roses? If so, can we safely guess who will win?

I have not, however, held any motivations to read the books, until possibly now.

This season revealed to me the group I find the most intriguing, compelling, and interesting: the Faceless Men (which isn't really surprising to me as the primary reason I like the Elder Scrolls video game series is because of the Dark Brotherhood.) I just never realized how cool they are until Arya (who is also my favorite character) started training with them this season. I decided earlier today that I no longer cared about living a spoiler-free lifestyle, and I must consume all information regarding the Faceless Men as soon as possible. However, I'm extremely confused by what I've been reading. This leads me to my questions.

- Who is Jeyne Poole?

This Game of Thrones wiki says that Jeyne Poole goes by the alias of Arya Stark: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jeyne_Poole It also seems to say that Jeyne gal marries Ramsay, which is weird because in the show Sansa marries Ramsay. So, is this Jeyne gal (who apparently was in the first episode of the TV show) just a girl pretending to be Arya? In other words, are Jeyne and Arya two different people? Or at some point in time, did Arya start masquerading as Jeyne as a result of her Faceless training? Who really married Ramsay, Arya or Jeyne? And why did Sansa marry him in the TV show?

- How many identities has Arya Stark assumed?

Regardless if Jeyne actually is or isn't also Arya, has she taken on the role of any other characters in Game of Thrones? (Books or TV.) In other words, does a viewer or reader think of two people as two separate characters when they are actually both secretly Arya? And, are there any seemingly two separate characters that are one (or more) Faceless Man? (Not confined to Arya.)

- Is Syrio a Faceless Man? 

I saw this image: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CD8aRrGVIAAgkkO.jpg

Quote from Syrio: ""There is only one god and his name is death""
Quote from Jaqen: ""There is only one god and a girl knows his name""

- At what point did Arya begin interacting with the Faceless Men (beyond her awareness) and was she chosen to help fulfill the organization's larger goals? If so, what are they?

- What sections out of books four &amp; five can I read that only have to do with Arya and her training with the Faceless Men? I really want to learn as much as I can about the group without reading all five books.

Thanks :)

However, he's been faced with many difficult decisions lately, everyone south of the wall minus Sansa and Theon want him dead.

Also, several storylines from the books have been cut this season. Many people assume it's because people will get confused with all of the different storylines. Well, for next season, it looks like Euron Greyjoy and Meribald will be in Season 6. And Episode 10s title, ""Mother's Mercy"" may refer to LSH.

Lately, I've been wondering what would happen if Stannis died. That would get rid of an entire storyline and, besides Dany (and possibly Doran), there wouldn't be any powerful characters trying to take the throne, which may become boring.

So I think that Stannis will die this season to make room for the Greyjoy and BWB storylines. These storylines may not appear in the same way they do in the book, though. With Dany going to be out of Meereen by the end of this season, possibly leaving Tyrion to try to save Meereen from Hizdahr or Daario, I feel that the Greyjoy storyline may focus in Westeros. This could mean replacing Stannis as the threat to the throne.

If I remember correctly, Joffrey was lamenting that they allowed the Northerners too much power and that he wanted to march his 'Royal Army' on Winterfell to install someone loyal to the throne. Cersei told him that this was a foolish idea, as Northerners were loyal to their own, and he'd never manage to get the Northerners to turn on their Lord. She also pointed out that once Winter came, the whole army would end up freezing to death.

In Season 5, episode 6, Cersei had a conversation with Petyr Baelish, in which he informed her the truth regarding Sansa and the Boltons; Cersei responded by saying that she'd skin Roose Bolton and his son 'like the man on their retched sigil' and when Petyr advised patience, she responded by saying that Sansa murdered her son and Roose Bolton is a traitor. Bear in mind, this was all said just as winter was beginning; almost as though Cersei had completely forgotten her own council to her son.

I imagine that they thought the ""spear story"" was supposed to develop Obara a little and show that they're complex characters, but it came off as a contrived theatre performance, and it came too fast; that kind of exposition is at least third-date material, not after meeting them for the first time.

The scene that got me the most, though, was with Tyene and Bronn. The poisoned spear made complete sense, but the antidote-ex-machina around Tyene's neck didn't. And then she actually gave him the antidote, and he got off with a nosebleed. It's not like I wanted Bronn to die, but why did they introduce the poison if just to take it away again? It felt like a waste of time, and a reason to get more boobs into the show. Why was Tyene even stripping for Bronn in the first place? Don't they hate each other?

When Joffrey was king, I remember the Kingsguard and the Goldcloaks were EVERYWHERE. In the throne room, at events, etc. Every member of the royal family was always escorted by guards.

I'm finding myself pretty friggin' drawn in to this stuff, but a lot of the historical epics that we know of don't really focus on the strategies of war, as much as they do the overall plot and character progression, which is fine in itself.

It reminds me of the Harry Potter films, where they just stuffed the cast with home-grown talent.


One thing I've always loved about HBO is that they don't rely on big name superstars (although when they have, it's still being great - e.g. True Detective). 

And of course the American (Peter Dinklage), Danish (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), Norweigan (Kristofer Hivju) and all other nationalities put in great performances.

It was, well, pretty good. Making a short story shorter, I binge-watched the entire 5 seasons and now I'm here to cool off and discuss before I head for the inevitable rewatch.

I hate the daenerys storyline. From the beginning, the concept of someone controlling dragons struck me as horrid for a politics-fantasy story. They's just too powerful.  At the risk of stating the obvious, they're huge, strong, fly, and breathe fire. Kill entire armies, unstoppable by the strongest castles (hello harrenhall). If this was modern politics, they'd be atomic bombs. Except no one else but dany can have them, and she has an unending supply. It cheapens the westeros stories because no matter who wins the iron throne, how many armies he has left, how good he is on the battlefield, how loved by his bannermen and allies, dany's dragons can fry all the same. From the moment she gets them, all she has to do is sit on her ass and wait for them to grow until she can mount them and majestly fly over westeros, breathing fire here and there until she can land on the iron throne. Screw politics, maneuvering, alliances, loyalty, just rulers, friendships and everything we love about this show. Power is power. The End. Thanks, Dany. 

But apparently, having an Ultimate-Super-Mega-Trump Card wasn't easy enough for poor Dany. First, let's give her three. So even if the westerosi manage to kill one by some miracle, there's another, and another. So much overkill. 

But not enough. Throw in 8000 super-soldiers. Not enough? Throw in a company of hardened mercenaries. More? Let's give her not one, but four world-class bodyguards/champions(Jorah, Barristan, Grey worm, Daario). 

Now onto her enemies, who must be made as weak, foolish, unlucky and villainous as possible. Let's see: two of them perished because they were too stupid to realize that dragons breathe fire and listen to their mother... one was a freakin warlock in his own magic tower, and he didn't see that coming? Just a few episodes before, he had the magic powers/intelligence to disappear after jorah stabbed him... Even baby dragons are a magic trump card to get anything Dany can possibly want. The other was the unsullied master, who was essentially betrayed by Dany, who didn't hold up her end of the bargain. If the guy had sold her swords instead of slaves, everyone could see she took the easiest path imaginable (I keep mine, I take yours, yadda yadda yadda life's good), but since he's a slaver, she gets a pass, as always. Absolute power is not enough, she also has carte blanche to betray her enemies, since they are so morally repulsive (thanks, overused slavery card). She dishonourably takes the gold of the second slaver city emissary even though it was meant to buy her off. 

The only enemies who had the right idea were the mercenary captains. Anyone with any stake in westeros or the slave cities should have her assassinated. Attacking her head-on or waiting spells certain defeat, given her armies and dragons, respectively. But no woman, no problem. No cry. No atomic bombs. Without her, her dragons will leave out the rest of their days peacefully, eating a statistically insignificant number of peasants instead of burning cities to the ground on her command. 

But of course, even though daario could have killed her if he wanted when he reached her bathing room, in another stroke of blind luck he decided to instead kill the only sensible men in essos. And of course, join her because god knows she doesn't have enough assets in her arsenal. Oh, great, one more champion for Goldilocks. Her enemies this season are played by extras with no dialogue. I rest my case.

I must say that, if in the past i thought that those ""little variations"" were acceptable, now the HBO people is totally raping a good story, for the sake of audience. I'm starting to totally lose interest in the TV show, which seems to be written by a dumb guy whos only purpose is to save money to producers. I don't give a damn about the actors, i love the story; why would you ever change the PLOT OF A BOOK to save minutes of appearence of a ""beloved by fan"" character? ain't it bad? ain't it something against the beauty of art? How much money would you accept to totally have your own story raped? Martin why did you do that? It just makes me sad, i had found something beautiful, and now it has become a cheap shit to me.
