Here is a screenshot of who I am talking about: http://imgur.com/8hIRchZ

She may have said her name once or so but its not a name I remember ever being referenced and she hides her face with her mask (which I think is pretty damn awesome).

She seems to know a lot about Jorah and Dany and even gave a brief warning to Jorah about The Doom of Valyria to which he replies ""I didn't come here for lessons"" (pretty blatant foreshadowing in hindsight).

How does she know who Jorah and Dany are? What am I missing about this Character? Are there any fan theories about who she is?

I propose that it is **Ramsay**. Here is why:

 * No one said the Warrior of Light is a pure and virtuous character, in fact some parts of the prophecy are troubling, like betraying those he loves. And Melisandre's visions showed and led to Shireen being burned, quite ruthless. Stannis barely went through with it; someone like Jon definitely couldn't. Ramsay, though - he'd have no problem making hard sacrifices.
 * In other words, the Warrior of Light will save humanity from the White Walkers and the army of the dead, but he doesn't have to be a nice guy, that's just how stories **typically** go, and I suspect GRRM is subverting that. Azor Ahai may be a horrible person, but he will still save humanity. Given everything we **actually** know about Azor Ahai - and ignoring the assumption that the saviour must also be ""good"" - Ramsay would best fit the role. The only reason we don't usually consider him is because he is ""bad"", and we assume that disqualifies him.
 * Ramsay (and the Boltons in general) will need to face the White Walkers, and soon, just because of geography. It would make sense for the Warrior of Light to be at that location, and with an army at his command - just like Ramsay is. Ramsay may be selfish and lacking in empathy, but he will fight the White Walkers with everything he has when they invade his lands.
 * We know Melisandre will walk atop the battlements of Winterfell, assuming we believe her visions - and I do believe that one, because it was actually quite specific. One way for her to get there is after Stannis conquers it, but that failed. Instead, if Ramsay is the Warrior of Light, and Melisandre sees that in a vision, she can just go to Winterfell and try to convince him to accept her as an ally. If she succeeds, she can then walk the battlements, fulfilling the prophecy. (And she can be rather convincing when she wants to be, especially given that Ramsay just lost both his sex partners at the end of S5E10.)

In the show, it's clear that Stannis is dead. Where else is there for Sansa and Reek to run to?

The Wall. To Jon. Unfortunately, they're obviously too late, but Sansa and Theon both share one thing in common; king's blood. Sansa, being a Stark of Winterfell, has the blood of the old Kings of Winter, and the blood of DaKingInDaNorf, Robb. Theon, being the last living son of Balon Greyjoy, king of the Iron Isles. 

This could lead to two, or possibly three, possibilities (in terms of the Jon res theory). 

1. Mel uses Theon as sacrifice. This would give him the chance to redeem himself in the eyes of the Starks. In the books, Robb legitimizes Jon before the Red Wedding, but word never reaches Castle Black. Theon perhaps giving his life to save Jon Snow could act as a way to make up for betraying the Starks.

2. Mel sacrifices Sansa. Being the eldest sister to Robb Stark, and having the blood of the old Kings of Winter, Sansa's blood could be used in the ritual, whether a few drops or her life all together. It'd seem bittersweet for Sansa and Jon to finally be reuinited, only for her to meet her end. This could also, loosely, fit into the Azor Ahai prophecy, as maybe a way to forge Lightbringer.

3. This is very coincidental and contextual. If Jon comes back as Jon Targaryen, through the sacrifice of either Theon or using some of Sansa's blood, it could give him a claim on the Throne if his recognition could come into play. I'd hate the cliche of Jon taking the Throne, but what if he took Sansa for his queen. The two never had a sibling relationship, and it would give Sansa what she had wanted; to be queen.

tl:dr, tinfoil = nipples on a breastplate and Reek/Sansa will play a part in Jon's resurrection and possibly the future of the Realm in a very niche, cliche scenario. ",1,1,False,default,,,,,

* I think he'll come back at the finale f the next season.

* yes, but not the whole season

* HE will be in a flashback or vision.

* John hasn't died yet

* Revived in the time frame of season 6 but not revealed to be alive until season 7.

* some form of him will come back, but he is no longer known as Jon Snow

* He wont be in Season 6 but will return in Season 7

* maybe not next season, but definitely before the end of the series



**Question 2: How?(is he alive)**

[Results Pi chart](http://i.imgur.com/4uO5GFk.png)

*  idk, will have to wait and see

* Reborn in fire.

* They'll start the process to bring him back to life in episode 10.

* Nobody cares about some dude named John enough to kill him

* she'll have something to do with some form of Jon being alive.

* involves the Old Gods and the Children of the Forests, probably even Bran

* He dies then wargs into grey wind, then they cut off grey winds head and sew it to his body, then they get overun with whitewalkers as Jon Sngrr gets resurrected as wolf-man.

* He becomes a sentient wight.

* he has to be in some sort of Flux state if he will be revived eventually. warging into ghost seems likely

&gt; I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye. I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings. I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, oh, I woke from terror. All this I dreamt, and more

So the burning heart butchering a stag is Renly's death and the dead fish is obviously Lady Stoneheart.

Remember, screen time is both expensive and scarce! Nothing is added without a good reason, and much that seems important has been cut. So if Bronn has been North of the Wall, either he did something there that's important for how the story evolves, or its foreshadowing that he's taking someone back North of the Wall, or will be sent back North of the Wall for some purpose.

So telling us Bronn has been North of the Wall is not a throw away scene, but info we need to understand the story, or at the very least, it's some foreshadowing. Remember, screen time is both expensive and scarce! Nothing is added without a good reason, and much that seems important has been cut. So if Bronn has been North of the Wall, either he did something there that's important for how the story evolves, or its foreshadowing that he's taking someone back North of the Wall, or will be sent back North of the Wall for some purpose.

I hate his character mostly because what he did to Bran, but other than that he was trying to be an honorable man, his tag as the Kingslayer has a deep impact into his feelings, he always wanted to be recognized by the people around him, when he back stab the Mad King, he was put in a very difficult situation, to respect his vows and fight against any men that enter that room(Ned Stark was the first) or to end the life of an awful king, a mad king and avoid any other conflicts, a difficult decision, perhaps he should have stand right to his vows like Barristan did, maybe he would have not been killed, Aerys was doom anyway, in first season i cannot but see that Jaime wants the respect of Ned Stark badly who consider him an oathbreaker and i don't blame Jaime for that, to have the respect of one of the most honorable man in Seven Kingdoms, means something.
Another issue for him is the family with a father who wants Jaime to be his heir and would do anything for that, his Sister which he loved, now i think Jaime see how crazy Cersei has become and don't have the same love as in season 1 when he throws Bran over the window, now he probably wouldn't do it, and his brother, Jaime being the only person which respect his brother, accept him and recognize his acts.
What change Jaime the most was Brienne, their adventure together change him, his arrogance dissapear, losing his hands might have been the best thing that happened to his character, because that's the moment when he realized that he cannot hide behind his money, his father and his interaction with Brienne made this thing look even stronger, he made him gain his honor back, he even refuse Cersei who ask him if he will kill or not Sansa after his vows to Lady Stark, that's something he would not have do in season 1 probably, he starts to see more and more of what Cersei really is and i think Jaime will almost sure kill Cersei, because of her going mad, also he would not catch the ending, i don't know i have a feel he will commit sucide, i hope not because that's a shame in already dirty Knighthood, i don't see any character that wants him death so bad, beside Lady Stark, which i don't think would be Jaime ending, he would die as a tragedy, he will redeem himself, but he will die, my betting is suicide.

During this scene, John's true identity would be revealed, and it would introduce the audience to how significant John actually is (that is, the audience who isn't already aware.) which would be necessary if he is going to be brought back to life.

Robin could have an impact in the battle for Winterfell 2.0 Littlefinger version if Littlefinger decides to march on Winterfell like he said in E507.

How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

##1.09 - ""Baelor""

* Directed By: Alan Taylor
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 12, 2011

As the Stark and Lannister armies prepare for their first battle against one another, Tyrion leads his barbarian allies into battle while Robb and Catelyn bargain for a renegade Lord's help. With Drogo dying from an infected wound, Daenerys goes to desperate measures to save her husband's life by using a witch's blood magic, much to the horror of the Dothraki. At the Wall, Maester Aemon reveals himself to be a Targaryen  and the price of loyalty  to Jon, who worries about events outside of the Wall. In a final bid to save his daughters' lives, Ned falsely confesses to conspiracy and swears fealty to Joffrey as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. To the horror of Ned's daughters  and delight of the assembled crowd  Joffrey has him executed.

##1.10 - ""Fire and Blood""

* Directed By: Alan Taylor
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 19, 2011

The news of Ned's execution quickly spreads to all corners of the Seven Kingdoms, triggering seismic events for each member of the Stark family. The North secedes from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaims Robb as their king. With Jaime captured by the Starks and Robert's brothers challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne, Lord Tywin Lannister appoints his son Tyrion as King's Hand to keep Joffrey and Cersei in check. Jon plans to desert his post at the Wall to avenge his father; his friends convince him to stay, and he joins the Night's Watch in an expedition to find Benjen Stark beyond the Wall. Daenerys learns to her sorrow that her unborn son is dead and her Drogo has been left in a vegetative state due to the witch's treacherous magic. Unable to bear her husband's ruin, Daenerys ends his life and lights a funeral pyre. She burns the witch alive alongside Drogo's body and her three dragon's eggs, and walks into the flames herself as the fire reaches its peak. When the embers die the following morning, Daenerys rises, unharmed, flanked by three newborn dragons.

As I watched Jaqen H'ghar pass as a Lannister soldier, I began to wonder how he went from Night's Watch press-gangee/prisoner to trusted soldier of House Lannister.

How does that even work? One minute you're as dangerous as a cannibal, being forced into service because you're a criminal, the next you're trusted to stand post at Harrenhal while Tywin Lannister shits and sleeps inside. Then again, they also allowed the cannibal into their ranks too, so they must be hurting for numbers.
So I'm thinking he must have silver-tongued his way into the uniform... while referring to himself/others as ""a man"" and ""a girl/woman/etc."" Isn't that a bit odd? If I met someone who only spoke in the third person, I'd be extremely wary of them. 

Which got me thinking... how does he manage even the most basic of infiltrations when he speaks/acts so conspicuously? Lommy would make a much better assassin. Or better, one of the extras (though we'd be venturing into suspend-your-disbelief at that point because obviously they wouldn't make a major character have zero screen time/dialogue). It reminds me of James Bond. I had an actual cold war spy in the family until he died, who always used to hate James Bond because he wouldn't realistically last a day as a spy for how flashy he is.

To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.

Could this mean, that Dany will eventually end up head-to-head with the Others, by circling the globe and entering the Lands Of Always Winter from the North - by a route past Asshai?

If I remember correctly, someone said that in the last long night, the dead also entered from the South-East. Could this be another route towards the Others? 

If you look at this (speculative) map...I think it could be possible:
http://www.infobarrel.com/media/image/141626_max.png

I would think it odd if Dany actually went to Westeros and approached the North from the South like everyone else. There appear to be far too many hurdles within Westeros to make this achievable. Perhaps the Wildlings band together with the Northmen, attacking from the South, as Dany and her Dragons attack from the North. That would be awesome!

In any case, I would *love* to see Asshai in the show. I'll bet it's creepy and dark, with lots of info to help us better understand the world of IaF.

274,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-4,2015,8,4,1,3fmt9w,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] [THEORY] Bran the Other: 5 Reasons the young Stark isn't what he seems,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3fmt9w/all_spoilers_theory_bran_the_other_5_reasons_the/,Jon-Wolf,1438618355,"(This is the first theory I'm posting on this sub so forgive me if someone already posted something similar)

The religions of Westeros and Essos don't often see things a black or white manner, but rather a large grey area of what is right and wrong. The faith of R'hllor is an exception. It is a distinctly monotheistic faith. Good vs. Evil. The Lord of Light vs. the Great Other. Fire vs. Ice. Since this is one of the only religions whose faith has been proved time and time again, let us pretend that the Red Priests got it right during this theory.

Now then, it is my belief that Bran Stark is being groomed by Brynden ""Bloodraven"" Rivers to be the hero of the Great Other (aka the Night's King) for the following reasons:

1. Bran's claim to fame is his ability to warg, a distinctly 'Old Gods' power. Mel claims that all other gods besides R'hllor are demons and false idols. Therefore in the eyes of the Red God, a Warg is a kind of demon.

2. The Red Priests worship fire as it brings light, heat, and life, and struggles against the darkness, cold, and death which are brought on by ice. They see it as Fire vs . Ice. And no place is filled with more ice, darkness, cold and death than the land beyond the wall where his pilgrimage leads him.

3. He is aided by Coldhands, a possible wight. Although Coldhands may seem like a good guy for rescuing Sam and Gilly, there is definitely something sinister about him. It is also clear that the only reason he did rescue Sam and Gilly was so Sam could bring him Bran through the Black Gate. Maybe Coldhands is a wight, maybe he's controlled by Bloodraven. But either way, dead men walking is never a good sign.

4. He is never attacked by White Walkers. Despite his long journey to the outskirts of the Lands of Always Winter, Bran and his companions are never confronted by the White Walkers themselves, only by Wights. A possible reason for this is that the White Walkers want Bran alive and therefore won't attack him and Wights seem to be mindless zombies who try to kill anything that moves.

5. He's not the nice guy you think he is. Despite seeming like a ""good-guy"" by ASOIAF standards, Bran has done some pretty evil deeds. Besides probably drinking Jojen Reed's blood (see Jojen Paste theory) and enjoying it, Bran lightheartedly performs one of the most disgusting, vile and evil acts that most Free Folk are afraid to even speak of: Warging people. Warging people is known as the most terrible thing a Warg can do. Even Varamyr Sixskins knows this and can't successfully warg a human without the human dying in the process. Yet Bran nonchalantly wargs Hodor almost daily, despite knowing how much it scares him.

Thanks for reading.

I touched on it briefly in another thread and felt it warranted expansion.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, by no means do I consider the theories below to be my final answer, I'm hoping this will be more of a discussion!

&amp;nbsp;

For the purpose of this thread, we are assuming R+L=J to be fact, at least in some form.

&amp;nbsp;

I think most of us can agree that it is no mere coincidence that three main characters, at least in terms of plot development, Tyrion, Dany, and Jon Snow all killed their mothers during their birth.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion's mother is confirmed dead, by among others, Jaime, Cersei, and of course father of the year, Tywin. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dany's mother is confirmed dead by herself and Viserys.

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow's mother is of course open to debate, but Ned's recollection of Lyanna's death at The Tower of Joy seems to allude very strongly to the fact that she died birthing Jon.

&amp;nbsp;

So are the deaths a means of character development/plot devices, or does GRRM have some sort of deeper hidden meaning like everything else he writes?

&amp;nbsp;

In Tyrion's case, Joanna's death certainly plays a large part in Tywin's hatred towards his son, which is a huge plot driver for Tyrion and Tywin. Along with being a dwarf, Tywin hates his son for killing his beloved wife. Tyrion grows up with only the iron fisted parenting of Tywin, without anything to temper his father's fire, as mother's are wont to do with their children. Had Joanna lived it is quite likely Tyrion would have been accepted to a degree, as opposed to merely tolerated by everyone but Jaime. Although Cersei would later receive more reasoning for her hatred of Tyrion from the Valonquar Prophecy, she might have properly identified the brother that most assume will kill her, Jaime, instead of Tyrion if she wasn't already predisposed to hate Tyrion for killing their mother.

&amp;nbsp;

So in Tyrion's case, killing his mother is a large plot device, shaping his relationships with his family from the day he was born. But I believe there to be a deeper reason as well, which we will touch on at the end.

&amp;nbsp;

In the case of Dany, her mother was killed in childbirth as they attempted to cross Blackwater Bay from King's Landing to Dragonstone. Timeline wise, Dany and Viserys are sent by the Mad King from King's Landing to Dragonstone when it appears likely that Robert's Rebellion will succeed, but BEFORE Tywin shows up and sacks KL. Along with giving Dany one hell of a nickname, Stormborn, Dany's mother's death sets her on a path of isolation and dependence on Viserys that causes her to grow up timid and afraid. The strongest part of Dany's character arc is her growth as a woman and leader, both of which would have been rendered moot had her mother still been alive. Dany would have had mother to guide and help her, along with more of a rallying point for Targ loyalists better than two infant children. So just like with Tyrion, Dany's mother's death is a driving force in her character arc. But also like Tyrion, there is a deeper meaning.

&amp;nbsp;

Last, we arrive at Jon Snow. Jon has yet to ascertain the identity of his mother, but most assume it to be Lyanna Stark. Ned's recollection of her death strongly implies she had just given birth. Unlike with Tyrion and Dany however, because Jon has yet to learn the identity of his mother, or even the fact that she is dead, Lyanna's death does not have a direct effect on Jon. Jon is driven by not knowing WHO his mother is, as opposed to knowing he killed her at birth. Now his true parentage is obviously the largest plot secret in Westeros, but Jon doesn't know that.

&amp;nbsp;

I do not believe in coincidences in GRRM's books, nor do I believe he used the same plot devices to drive two very different characters. So what's the meaning behind the three main characters killing their mothers? First and foremost I believe it marks all three as being of the utmost importance to the story. I love characters like Arya and Sansa, but ultimately their stories are of little consequence to the main plot. These three are the movers and shakers of the world of Westeros, with much of the story revolving around them and their choices.

&amp;nbsp;

I also believe that it marks them as the three heads of the dragon as prophesied by Rhaegar. But here is where I believe my thoughts differ from most. I do not believe that this necessarily means they are literally the three dragon riders. I believe Rhaegar was referring to a figurative dragon, not a literal one. Rhaegar certainly could have been privy to some sort of foreknowledge that Dany would eventually hatch dragon eggs, but I count that as unlikely mainly because assuming the Aegon that miracously showed up in A Feast for Crows is the ""Mummer's Dragon"" referred to by Quiathe, Rhaeger did not foresee the the death of Aegon, along with whomever he was counting as the second head at the time (Viserys, Dany, etc.)

&amp;nbsp;

As stated, I do not believe the three headed dragon to be solely a literal occurrence. One of the underlying themes of the novels regards how the world is out of balance. Summers and Winters can last decades, and the Others have returned for the first time in over 8000 years. GRRM has stated that by the end of the series, the world will be back in balance, with seasons lasting more closely to what we are accustomed to. If you believe the Others represent one side of the coin so to speak, I believe the three headed dragon will represent the flip side. Ice and Fire.

&amp;nbsp;

When the proverbial stuff hits the fan, the three headed dragon (figuratively) will lead the fight, using among other things, Dany's three dragons (literally.) Dany, Jon, and Tyrion represent a balance of the three major houses. I know there are 7 technically, but the other four all take their cues from Stark, Targaryen or Lannister. Dany is 100% pure Targaryen, Jon a mix of Stark and Targ, and Tyrion represents the Lannisters. Sort of like Captain Planet, in order for the Others to be defeated, the three major houses will have to work together in order to defeat them. Each will have a key part to play, and a part only each of them can perform. For instance, Jon would theoretically be the only one able to warg into a dragon.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless of the ultimate role they play, I do believe it to be of great significance that Jon, Tyrion, and Dany killed their mothers in birth. I am open to discussion, and clarification, I know some of the prophecies are hard to follow. Thanks for reading!",14,0,False,self,,,,,

Tyrion could possibly not be Tywins son, but Aerys II Targaryian's. Aerys was always fond of Tywin's wife Joanna, and there were even rumors that the two had sex before Joanna left to return to Casterly Rock. Joanna eventually saw the king again at a tournament where she presented Aerys with her twins. Aerys spoke of how beautiful her breasts looked despite childbirth. After Aerys first son Rhagaer he had a difficult time with his wife Rhalle to have more children. Those Rhalle gave birth to were usually very sick, mishaped and twisted. Now with Tywins first two children being born as twins, and looking as beautiful as they are mentioned it doesn't make much sense for Tywin to have such a birth happen. At this point Tywin and Aerys had a major falling out, and weren't the friends they once were. Aerys did everything in his power to humiliate Tywin, and after Aerys compliments Joanna some months later Tyrion is born as this deformed child. Aerys joked at how Tywin at first had two beautiful children, but now has a deformed son.The man who always got deformity from his attempts at baring a child now gave Tywin the ultimate humility. He had sex with Joanna and now Tywin is the laughing stock of the seven kingdoms because of this deformed son his wife bore before dying. Isn't it odd that Joanna survived childbirth from twins, but yet died to giving birth to a dwarf? It seems that Tyrion was indeed Aerys doing as another way to humiliate Tywin.

Id just like to make an announcement regarding greyscale. My mother and I were watching Season 5 together and so far shes enjoyed the plot twists, gotten attached to characters and put lots of thought into the show. 

However, the focus on greyscale and how the disease spreads has upset her. My mother was born with tylosis, a genetic condition in which scaly skin covers her palms and the soles of her feet. It is not contagious; only a genetic condition. I've held her hand my whole life and I have not gotten her condition. However, she has been shamed for her whole life for having it, and it limits her in many ways. It has impacted her self-esteem to the point that she doesnt feel like she can pursue higher goals (so she never did go to college), and now in her fifties, she doesnt feel she can get a job even at the local supermarket as a cashier because she doesnt want others to see her hands. Even cashiers at stores sometimes twist their faces in disgust at her condition when they hand her change.

Her mother, like Selyse, has been ashamed of her for having this condition for her whole life, hiding her, just like Shireen was hidden.

What is the point of this post? As I realize Game of Thrones has such a large audience, I hope you can take in consideration how my mother feels. Shes afraid that because of the widespread effect of this show, people will think her condition is contagious, like greyscale. 

Her case is rare, but there are indeed others in the world with her condition, and the affected area can be on their face and body like the Stone Men. Theres a medication for it, which causes the skin to peel, but she cant deal with it because simply swiping her shoulder against a sofa will cause her skin to break and bleed.

Im begging you all here to please be considerate of those with my mothers condition and not look at her or similar people any differently. Shell probably hate that Im making a post like this, but its probably for her own good and others that we are all more aware that such a condition actually exists and its no joke.

She wishes George R. R. Martin will write so that eventually there will be a cure for greyscale and a return of the stone men to do what normal men can do. She wants hope. I cant guarantee her that George R.R. Martin will do this, but I can ask all of you to be considerate and informed that people like her are not contagious and they are people with feelings.

Thank you for reading!

*Note that each of the above begin with a foreword lasting approximately 5 minutes.

So it seems that many of you might not even be aware these exist, but included with every Blu-Ray release of each season is a feature called ""Histories &amp; Lore"". These are brief (approx. 2-6 minutes, totalling about an hour per season) animated episodes, explaining in greater detail many notable events, characters, and house histories in the world of Game Of Thrones. Topics include:

* An extensive and detailed re-telling of Robert's Rebellion, from beginning to end, from multiple viewpoints and biases
* The Children of The Forest, The First Men, and The Andals.
* Aegon's conquest of Westeros
* The history of The Night's Watch
* The Age of Heroes
* Detailed histories on many of the noble houses (Stark, Lannister, Tully, Tyrell, Targaryen, etc.)
* The Doom of Valyria
* The Free Cities of Essos
* The Greyjoy Rebellion

... and much more.

They are all narrated by characters (and yes, the actual actors) appropriate to the topic at hand. Prominent speakers include:

* Bran Stark
* Robb Stark
* Robert Barratheon
* Stannis Barratheon
* Tywin Lannister
* Jorah Mormont
* Viserys Targaryen

...and again, many more. No Hodor yet, sadly.

It's a fantastic resource as a crash-course on the history of the world, and the shape of current relations between many characters and houses. The many examinations of Robert's Rebellion help greatly to flesh things out in season one in particular, as do detailed looks into The Greyjoy Rebellion and The Siege Of Storm's End further on.

For those of you re-watching the series along with the subreddit, now is as good a time as any to enjoy them. Though admittedly I should have made this topic when the re-watch started...",15,162,False,self,,,,,

Stannis was blamed on not being tactically wise and fighting in the open field while later it CUTS to a forest and we see dead bodies everywhere which assumingly means they fought there...
This would nerf the Bolton Cavarly and make it a more even fight...Sheer numbers is Stannis's downfall here..I was studying the background and I see dead Boltons along with dead Baratheons..And every dead horse we see also indicates a dead Bolton since Stannis has no Cavarly..

Now this could be just of the shit writing David and Dan have but how the hell Stannis dies in the Forest is beyond me..They should have been crushed in one charge...But since its in a forest okay...

We also see scarcely any Bolton soldiers marching around..You would assume finding and killing Stannis would be important but we only see one cavarly Bolton and two dismounted cavarly who get killed...Where is the Bolton army in here?

He only committed atrocities (minus Tyrion's tormenting) so that his family would be safe, powerful, and remembered. Littlefinger is the same, except without a family. In fact, he worked (and is still working) harder than Tywin to rise to and maintain power.  To top off the fact that he was not of particularly high birth, he also was born sickly and weak. Knighthood wasn't an option for him. Tywin was born into a great family, and although it was troubled at the time, still had an advantage over everyone. Perhaps Littlefinger wishes to found a family of his own. Maybe he'll do whatever it takes to keep them safe as well.Perhaps I'm wrong.

I don't think the whole mess up north is all that threatening overall.

The whole thing is that the white walkers are hard to kill and there are a ton of wights. 

And yet for all that, we know that obsdian (of which there is ample supply of) and valerian steel (much rarer, although still likely to come into play) kill them easily. If Sam Tarly can kill one, I'm hardly worried about them taking over the world. Not only that, but we saw from Jon's fight that they are hardly exemplary swordsmen. 

As to the wights, all they have going for them is numbers. They may be terrifying and numerous, but I still get a Mance Rayder sorta vibe from them, where the first strong force they come across will decimate them. I fully expect a battle of the blackwater esq-thing with some wildfire or burning oil to rek them good.

Am I misreading the scenario? I suppose the chance is always there that events of the realm weaken it to the degree where the white walkers can stroll in easy (looking at you, Cersei).

I've always felt more connected to it since we're actually seeing them instead of just reading about them.  You can kind of see and feel the emotion through actors, you know?  I don't particularly read books, though.

I really do want to read the books and have some more depth about the characters and the world around them.  However, I don't want to keep thinking the entire time while watching the show, ""well that's not how it went down in the books.""  You feel me?",12,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm caught up with the Television series, so I got an idea of what's going on. I'm midway through book 2, and a few things stuck out to me in the novels by already watching the TV series. 

 Theon, After coming home his world is turned upside down, and no one respects him. On page 384 it says ""but Theon spent ten years in Winterfell, and did not intend to go to war without a good mount beneath him."" At this moment has he decided to betray the Starks? I understand he's doing it to impress his people and father, and become king. I'm not saying he would/could follow through, but he made the decision in his mind to betray them, correct? There's another source before this I can't find.

Maybe this seems obviously clear to everyone, but I was just curious what others thought.

542,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-6,2015,8,6,3,3fwhvj,self.gameofthrones,"[ALL SPOILERS][THEORY] Aerys II, the sane king?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3fwhvj/all_spoilerstheory_aerys_ii_the_sane_king/,Quiddity99,1438797673,"Very little remains of Aerys II's reign except for the lingering whispers of his madness. He was known for a fondness for watching people burn, and seemingly condemned many innocents to the stake to satisfy his odd sexual urges. It was said that in his later years, he was only able to achieve sexual arousal by watching people burn. And yet, his earlier years paint the picture of a man troubled by his mediocrity and the life that was thrust down on him by a royal bloodline. So why the sudden change? 

Many chalk it up to the rumored ""Targaryen Madness"", but I propose that this was part of a ploy committed by a man who knew that the masses would do exactly that. I propose that he was poisoned with [basilisk blood](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Basilisk), known to ""induce a violent madness in any creature with warm blood, whether man or beast."" I believe that this was a plot by Tywin Lannister, who was becoming more distrusted by the king with each passing day, in order to maintain his influence as the most powerful man in Westeros.

Barristan Selmy stated that Aerys II was always a suspicious man, but that that it was only after the Defiance of Duskendale that he became ""The Mad King"" as he is presently remembered. For those unfamiliar, here are the key points:

* Aerys II had a complicated relationship with Tywin, mostly because Aerys was reportedly infatuated with Tywin's wife and made numerous lewd insinuations about her. Tywin was less than pleased about it. 

* Aerys II was the king, and Tywin Lannister was the Hand of the King. Tywin was renown for his efficacy, Aerys II was later said to have been little more than a figurehead. Aerys II didn't enjoy these rumors, and had Ser Ilyn Payne's tongue cut from his mouth for repeating the accusation.

* The Lord of Duskendale acted on rumors of Aerys II's incompetence and invited him to his land to discuss a treaty that would give him more autonomy. Aerys II was wary of this and did not intend to go, until Tywin told him that he shouldn't. 

* Aerys II went to Duskendale with a single guard and was kidnapped and ransomed. 

* Barristan Selmy daringly rescued Aerys II by slipping into the keep of Duskendale in the middle of the night.

* Aerys II came back to King's Landing a changed man, by all accounts absolutely crazy. As the Wiki puts it: ""His jealous and suspicious nature deepened into paranoia and eventually outright delusions, seeing evidence of treachery everywhere"".

I believe that this was all manufactured by Tywin Lannister, who could have used his influence to manipulate the Lord of Duskendale into kidnapping the king and manipulated the King into leaving for Duskendale. It was there that Aerys II was poisoned with Basilisk blood to induce madness. I believe that Tywin Lannister also allowed for his rescue, as he was essentially in a win/win situation:

* If Aerys II was not rescued and somehow died in Duskendale, he would be blameless for the act. He would be able to maintain a strong position as Hand of the King with Rhaegar Targaryen, who was around 13-14 at the time, and would likely be able to rule the kingdom until Rhaegar was old enough to become autonomous from a council of advisers.

* If Aerys II was rescued, then the madness of Basilisk Blood would drive Westeros apart. He could separate himself from the King, citing his already crumbling relationship, and maintain a stronghold at Casterly Rock while the events played out. Then ever the opportunist, he could jump into the game while his enemies were weak and seize more power from the smoldering remains of battle. These are essentially the events that *actually played out*. 

There's more to gain from setting up the pieces and watching them fall. If he helped destroy the dynasty, then he could capitalize from the wreckage and potentially gain a lot more than he would have otherwise.

But if his plan failed and the dynasty continued, then he could still capitalize on Aerys's death through other means of political posturing. The proposed marriage between Cersei and Rhaegar would be one means through which he could help his family achieve power, even though this ultimately fell through when Aerys promised his son to another woman.

And Aerys's suspicions of Tywin, ironically, make this all the more true. *His suspicions were rooted in truth.* And then after he came back, his madness painted all past suspicions with a new light. Death creates a martyr, but discrediting your opponent so that their friends turn on them creates few potential enemies, and more friends.  

As we know, Robert Barratheon defeated Rhaegar Targaryen and claimed the crown for himself. He then became known as a piss-poor king, while Tywin Lannister controlled Westeros in the small council and remained ""The Most Powerful Man in Westeros"" until his untimely death.


***


**TL;DR: Tywin had Aerys II poisoned into madness, and orchestrated Robert's Rebellion as a political move to keep himself in power.**

Now what I wonder if he has been spotted at various sets of the thrones of Northern westeros . Is his corpse travelling? And does it take that long to shoot a funeral and these many sightings.

Also Almeria is rumoured to be one of the sets for s6 and there was a recent casting call before kit got spotted there. Co-incidentally Spain is listed as a shooting location for Kits movie Brimstone (Almeria not specified as such), Now was it a co-incidence that he was there around GOT's casting call.

Secondly if he was there for GOT, what role could he be playing at the Almeria set. What is his corpse or he doing in Kings Landing or at the rumoured TOJ location? 

Intriguing ... Kit says he doesn't give pics in Ireland but in the Spain pics he has posed with a few fans . He was there for two- three days and then returned to Ireland. His sightings are making his role for s6 as a corpse/funeral / return/ resurrection even more confusing!!

**Edit:** Read /u/IAmAStannisBaratheon's post and gained some much-needed insight.

Were having a fundamental miscommunication here.

Most of these posts are explaining Stannis motivations and beliefs, and judging him based off of the knowledge he had available. Because you can understand and follow his reasoning, you back him. And I will admit, from his point of view, if we are looking at things purely as how Stannis believed them to be and accepting that as reality, then yes, his actions were very honorable and he was a great man who made a huge personal sacrifice for the greater good.

**This explains his actions. It does *not* justify them.**

Ive been arguing from an outside perspective, under the assumption that Stannis was mistaken (which he was). I was not empathizing with Stannis. The fact that he was mistaken in the end is ultimately beside the point to Stannis fans because he could not have known that (well, you could argue that *burning a small child in front of your men is generally not good for morale, like why the fuck did he do that?* Whatever). There was never any other way for him without forfeiting his duty and honor. And that makes it impossible to condemn his actions. Sure, he could have tried looking outside his own perspective and second-guessing himself, but as Aemon mentioned earlier in the season (artful, really) a ruler cannot doubt himself.

So Stannis story was a tragic one. I understand. I still don't like him, but I get it.

**TL;DR:** I understand Stannis fans now and damn this season mustve been harder on you than Sansa fans.

We all know daenerys rides Drogon, but who will ride the others? Many people believe it will be tyrion and Jon, and so do I. But I think there is a deeper symbolism that proves that these will be the riders.
Daenerys will ride Drogon as Drogo was her love
Tyrion will ride Viserion as his scales are golden (like a lannister)
Jon will ride Rhaegal as he is named after his father (if r+ l=j is true)

I was worried because I loved the the first 3 books so much and had heard mixed reviews about 4 and 5 but I was very pleasantly surprised. Anyway, I am a show watcher first but the show got me into the books.

My question here is why people think that the creators decided to change SO MUCH in season 5 when they had been very true to the books until this point?

Some of the Major plot lines I loved in the book but missed in the show:

Arianna Martell trying to crown Myrcella

The whole Iron Islands plot

Lady Stoneheart and the outlaws in the Riverlands

Jamie taking Riverrun while staying true to his oath to Catelyn Stark

I hope the show gets back on track next season.

Time to start ADWD....

14:23 - Brienne hears something off to the side.
14:32 - The camera's perspective is of someone watching Pod through the trees.
15:36 - Detailed exposition between Pod and Brienne about whether she is released from her vow to Cat because she has been unable to convince the girls to come with her.

As much sense as the R + L = J theory makes, it completely discounts the fact that the father's hair color is predominant. Wasn't this made painfully clear via Ned Starks and Jon Arryns research into the lineage of the Baratheon and Lannister blood lines, when they discovered that Robert was indeed not the father of Tommen, Mycella, and that demon shit Joffery?

If R + L = J were true, wouldnt Jon Snow's hair be silver or at least a great deal lighter? Hair of black leads to hair of black. Hair of gold to hair of gold. Etc, etc.

I've enjoyed following this subreddit, and here's what I've learned so far.  

1) R+L=J is sacred. If you want to be down voted quickly, just dare to question this one!  

2) Melisandre will resurrect Jon Snow. See above.  

3) The finale will either be a straight up epic battle between good and evil, or a bittersweet new treaty/understanding between Ice and Fire. Either or. No in between position  allowed.

4) Everyone is ambiguously good or evil, except Jon Snow and Podrick who are 100% good, and Ramsay Snow, who is 100% evil.  

5) What's dead is not dead is not dead. Everyone who has died in the series is 100% guaranteed to be resurrected...by Melisandre, the Nights King, Qyburn, or the Old Gods. Don't question this one...just accept.  

6)  Nobody is who they seem. Darrio is Benjen. Gendry is the heir to the Iron Throne. Jon Snow is a Targaryen.The High Septon is the Howland Reed. So hard to keep up. Too many Targaryens.  

7) If you want to get up voted to the heavens post a picture of a piece of toast that looks like Jon Snow. Or a cloud that looks like a wolf. Guaranteed.  

8) /r/GameOfThrones is like crack. Once you start, that's it. Hooked for life.    

9) Cleganebowl is fucking confirmed!

Anyways, it's a pleasure to ""discuss"" my favourite obsession with like minded fans. Totally loving it.",121,76,False,self,,,,,

But there is a rather large piece that to me doesn't make sense. 

If the 'R' in the equation is really Rhaegar, wouldn't Jon display SOME characteristics of Targaryens? Silvery hair or violet eyes, perhaps? All the descriptions of characters with a significant amount of Targaryen blood have some of those features. Jone has none. Additionally, he has shown the propensity for being susceptible to burns (his hand), something that at least Daenerys (a true dragon) has shown immunity to. 

Instead....

Jon is dark; black of hair, black of eye. What children of another character's lineage do we KNOW for a FACT display those characteristics? The other most significant 'R' in the whole series.............Robert Baratheon. In fact, we spend a large portion of the first season/book with Ned puzzling out why Joff, Tommen and Myrcella look nothing like Robert; they were not his children, but Gendry, Edric Storm and all the rest of Robert's bastards have his black hair. What if Jon is actually Robert and Lyanna's child, but no one knows it? Sure, Rhaegar and Lyanna may have run off together, resulting in the incident at the Tower of Joy, but what if she was *already* pregnant with Robert's child, the boy who would grow up to be Jon Snow? This would give him (arguably) an even better claim to the throne than if he was a Targaryen, seeing as how people still view Tommen as legitimate through the belief that he is Robert's son.

Maybe I'm crazy, but to me at least there are pieces of this that make some degree of sense.

But I think we mightn't know about it until maybe the season 6 finale.

I think that Mellisandre will disguise someone as Jon like she did with mance rayder in the books. It will look like to us that Jon is being burnt but really it's someone else. I don't know if mel's magic thing works on the person if they're dead so I could be completely wrong. 


It could also explain if he wasn't doing much acting for the show. If he was just in like a burning scene at the start and a scene revealing he is still alive at the end he could easily pass off that he was just used as a dead body.

It's just an interesting theory that I had about Jon and think it might be true.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

show that had recently become popular amongst the citys smallfolk; a puppet show wherein the 
kingdom of the beasts was ruled by a pride of haughty lions. The puppet lions grow greedy and 
arrogant as this treasonous tale proceeds, until they begin to devour their own subjects. When the 
noble stag makes objection, the lions devour him as well, and roar that it is their right as the 
mightiest of beasts. 
And is that the end of it? Cersei asked, amused. Looked at in the right light, it could be seen

No, Your Grace. At the end a dragon hatches from an egg and devours all of the lions. 
The ending took the puppet show from simple insolence to treason. Witless fools. Only cretins 
would hazard their heads upon a wooden dragon. She considered a moment. Send some of 
your whisperers to these shows and make note of who attends. If any of them should be men of 
note, I would know their names. 

I didn't read the 5th book but I already finished the Season 5 of the TV Show. I really think this is interesting because all the books have this type of dialogue who predict something.

Of course if i say this considering the actual story, i would tell that the ""dragon"" is Daenerys, conquering the Iron Throne and defeating the lions.

But looking others theories, this ""dragon"" really can be Jon Snow, right? I mean, not only because of the theory who tells that Jon Snow is actually Targaryen, but also adding the fact that Azor Ahai is a ""son of fire"", and probably born from a targaryen.

During my rewatch of the show I noticed something that might give some legitimacy to this theory in season 2 episode seven Bran escapes winterfell with rickon therefore no longer having a stark reside in winterfell. In episode ten of season 2 we see the white walkers marching south for the first time and this got me thinking. Was the saying ""there must always be a stark in winterfell"" stating the fact that the only thing keeping the walkers from making their march south again the fact that a stark remained in winterfell? Is that why the walkers are never shown walking with the army of the dead until after all Starks have gone from winterfell? What do you think? Could this play a part in the war to come?

In this scenario they're just defending themselves, and from their perspective they are the heroes of this story.  

So it just occurred to me that the Others are deliberately driving the Wildlings south of the Wall, rather than massacring any and all Wildlings they come across. The question is -Why?  

One theory that has some traction on other subreddits is that as part of this ancient pact the Others are bound to defend/support the Starks. Or that the Others demand that ""there must always be a Stark at Winterfell"". So is it possible that the Others, who can't cross the Wall themselves, are driving the Wildlings south to provide an army for the Starks? Not under their control of course, but natural allies against the dragons/fire. If yes, it gives a whole other interpretation to the encounter between the Nights King and Jon. And suggests what Benjen may be doing North of the Wall. ",27,7,False,self,,,,,

Littlefinger talked about the Knights of the Vale and how they could help attacking the North, but as we know Littlefinger by himself wont make them fight but imagine he somehow gets Stannis, the Knights of the Vale were loyal to Ned and before Ned died he said he sent the same message to different corners of the realm telling Stannis was the rightful king because Robert had no true sons, only bastards born of incest, my idea was Stannis, since he is a war veteran and had Ned supporting his cause maybe he could lead and make the Knights of the Vale fight with him.

Littlefinger would betray the crown but if we think about it they are really weak, they lost Varys, their king is useless, Queen regent gets humiliated, they also lost Tyrion that although most of them despise always had solution to problems in King's Landing and Tywin is dead... Maybe it was time for him to find new allies.

Even if he makes it at this point of the story no one likes Stannis and he has no where to go, the crown wants him dead, Boltons want him dead, Melisandre abandoned him... I think the only one who could save him is Littlefinger but this is impossible to happen just a theory that came to my mind.

We were pretty excited to binge it since it seemed right up our alley. We got to... I think the third episode of the second season before giving up. Just could not get into it. Pretty disappointed (in ourselves) that we didn't enjoy it, especially since all of our friends love it. So, what are we missing? We've heard ""it's  better if you've read the books."" I guess our main complaints (and I hesitate to even say them because I don't want to sound like I'm trashing anything, I just want to give a better idea of what we might be getting wrong) is how much the story jumps around, making it hard to focus on anything in depth; the sex which sometimes is unnecessary (and no, I'm not a prude. It just seems gratuitous to the point of being distracting. I'd rather have more complex plot than titties, but I'm probably a minority lol); and weak dialogue. We were hoping it would sit nicely alongside our other favorites, like Vikings, True Detective, and Downton Abbey. I really am not trying to be insulting; I honestly almost started watching it again today but figured I'd try for a change of perspective. We WANT to love this show!

One point of discussion I remember hearing fairly frequently early in season 5 goes along these lines: ""If Joffrey were still in charge he'd have the Faith Militant cut down and the High Sparrow's head on a spike before they could lay a hand on Margaery."" 

While a lack of bravery certainly does play a part in Tommen's unwillingness to take any military action, I think that by the time the High Sparrow is given authority by Cersei (or maybe even a little while before), the Faith Militant is already too entrenched in King's Landing to be removed without dire consequences. They even manage to break into the brothels and assault the High Septon!

Keep in mind that the reason the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant are even around is the fact that the smallfolk have been made to suffer the horrors of war by the hundreds of thousands. For in-show evidence you only need to look at Arya's stint in Harrenhal or well...every battle scene in the show. In such circumstances people tend to turn to religion, and the H.S and F.M are prime examples of the consequences of the War of the Five Kings. It's as if fans of the show assume that such consequences could be easily brushed aside. 

Here are the military forces the crown has at their disposal:

1. The Kingsguard (only seven individuals; I don't think they would have been enough to fight back against the High Sparrow's henchmen when they seize Margaery)

2. The City Guard (composed of lowborn men; lowborn men are a main demographic of the Faith Militant -- and their loyalty has already been demonstrated to be unreliable e.g. Janos Slynt)

3. Lannister guardsmen. The same things I stated about the City Guard apply.

4. Tyrell guardsmen. House Tyrell is the best asset Tommen has against the Faith Militant, because they can provide the resources needed to sway the smallfolk into the side of the crown. However, it won't be that simple! The High Sparrow has been shown to demonstrate charisma and political acumen (which is why he's the goddam High Sparrow in the first place). The smallfolk which the Faith appeals to are the ones who produce the crops in the first place. A political battle would be too tedious and lengthy. 

Things definitely seem stacked in favor of the H.S.. By the way, remember the King's Landing riot that almost killed Joffrey? The one that ended in the death of a puppet High Septon and two Kingsguard? The power of the smallfolk cannot be underestimated. When I saw Tommen confronting the Faith Militant in an attempt to free Loras, I didn't think ""Gee, if Joffrey was in his place he'd have them hacked to pieces easily and proceed to have sexy fun time with Margaery while using the High Sparrow as target practice."" I thought ""if Tommen tries anything I should start expecting Queen Myrcella to have a lot of vacant Kingsguard positions to fill up.""",27,25,False,self,,,,,

This happened during the tourney at Harenhal. Let us assume this is true. Then who is the bastard?
First off, I'm going to go with R+L=J being true. And secondly, Ned is said to have been great friends with Robert Baratheon. This to me has always seemed strange, since they don't seem very similar. Even if they did grow up together, there has to be something to make them become friends. Therefore I'm going to assume that Ned used to be a joyful fellow before becoming a cold paragon of justice. 
But what changed him? This is where my original theory comes in. I think that he and Ashara Dayne had a child and this whole event left Ned cold and honourable after seeing what happens when he's not.
Now who is the child? I think I know the answer. It's, don't laugh, Hodor. His age isn't specified and since he is supposed to be huge from a disorder, he could still be a teenager. So his age is fine. But that isn't enough. I can't just throw that out and expect people to be convinced. So I'll explain how this fits in.
We'll assume that Hodor was born prematurely, before Jon snow. This would make everyone think he'll die an infant. And that makes Ashara kill herself so she doesn't have to live through her child's death. But Hodor lives, and (maybe from a disorder from being born prematurely) grows to be huge. As Ned live through his love being killed and his son miraculous survival, he keeps the son, but ashamed, becomes cold and distances himself from him. This would make sense, as Ned is described as cold by others and it doesn't make sense that a cold person was Robert's best friend. Perhaps he only became that. He tries to avoid Hodor as he grows into a huge halwit, his honour only increased by this as the time goes, a constant reminder of what passion can make. Back at Winterfell they conjure a story that old nan is his ancestor, perhaps hoping he would grow huge to seem older than he is and give this story credit. 
But still, why Hodor? Well, the last thing that convinces me is very vague, but Hodor, of all the courtiers in Winterfell, goes with Bran, Rickon and reeds north. Why him? Why a loud halwit who can only compromise their mission? 
This makes me think there is SOMETHING special about him, I just can't pinpoint what. I made several branching theories about the end of this theory, none of them just seem plausible. I think I'll post edits linking to them. For now, this I think is certain.",21,2,False,self,,,,,

Sure, there's a lot of exposition and what not, but considering how Season 6 is going to have a bunch of flashbacks, I can't see why the show didn't feel the need to slow down (actually I would have half expected HBO to get some more 'fillers' out rather than rush the story).

The way I see it, Season 4 should have had Joffrey's death later in the season rather than the second episode and covered more exposition and furthered Arya's story a bit more, so that Season 5 could have felt a bit more breath of fresh air to cover plots in more detail and leave Season 6 to properly go through Stannis's fall.

To me that long running thread of Stannis since the beginning of Season 2, felt the most rushed and the most dissapointing. Especially after reading the books AND the behind the scenes documents from the show itself, a battle hardened commander who commanded thousands losing in that fashion? And then suddenly Brienne coming out of nowhere?

Critical plot pieces are missing in Stannis's story, Dany's, Tirion's etc.

This could be pure bologna but hear me out:

* Sansa and Theon are on the run from Ramsay, a man who arguably loves this kind of hunt. For several episodes Sansa and Theon bond as they run from the crazy shirtless man.
* Of course, it will appear that they find safety, but Ramsay will come knocking. Sansa goes into full self-preservation and murders Theon, or perhaps blames him when Ramsay appears.
* To avoid torture and ultimately death, Sansa takes on a vicious and cruel demeanor to charm Ramsay. She deflects anyone from coming close to her. Instead of becoming like Catelyn, she becomes like Cersei. (or perhaps Cat would have acted the same given said situation)
* Eventually, John runs across Sansa and the new Lord of Winterfell (Ramsay). Even though she had taken on her vicious demeanor as a farce to fool Ramsay, it now defines her. She sides with Ramsay against John. 
* Brienne of Tarth tries to help Sansa, but realizes that she has turned cruel. She finally realizes that oaths are fucking stupid. She leaves - which is important as she is the only who could save Sansa from the following...
* Arya comes into the picture. The two sisters are thrown together again with Arya taking away the man who Sansa is to be with (as she sees it). In the end, Arya kills Sansa.
* Bran becomes a dragon rider and couldn't give less of a fuck.
* John moves beyond the north, defeats the baddies and either gets with Dany, replaces Dany or dies. Or maybe he's dead. Whatever.
* Ramsay is gone ( by Arya or simply battle ) and Sansa is dead so Rickon takes over and has twenty children who all have their own dire wolves and live happily ever after. 

edit: It would be fun to see Littlefinger fall to his own love of chaos -&gt; through Sansa Stark. Perhaps he thinks she is still his little bird to manipulate but in fact she has now transformed into someone just as cruel and uncaring as he.

After Robert says she should be buried somewhere with a landscape to match her beauty, to which Ned responds:


&gt;'I was with her when she died. She wanted to come home to rest beside Brandon and father.' He could still hear her at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister's eyes. Ned remembered the way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. Ned could recall none of it. 'I bring her flowers when I can,' he said. 'Lyanna was... fond of flowers.'


So she was holding rose petals that were now dead, so they've been there a while. This can be supported by the room smelling as strong of blood as it did roses, meaning the roses must've been there a ~day (I don't know, but definitely have been there). Since she was holding them, they probably meant something to her.


I believe this further legitimizes that the Tower of Joy was their lover's den, seeing that all this could be explained by Rhaegar knowing she likes flowers, and then spreading rose petals around the tower of joy to get the lady juices flowing. I'm sure this could've also been put together much more eloquently and succinctly, but you get what I'm trying to prove.
They also keep mentioning hand singularly. The fingers that held Ned's hand was the same that dropped the dead petals and that Howland had to remove from Eddard's hand. Maybe the other one was holding Jon?",17,34,False,self,,,,,

##2.01 - ""The North Remembers""

* Directed By: Alan Taylor
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 1, 2012

To Cersei's dismay, Tyrion takes up his post as acting Hand at King's Landing. At Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon proclaims allegiance to Melisandre's new god and lays public claim to the Iron Throne, revealing Joffrey's bastardry. As this news reaches the capital, the Gold Cloaks slaughter Robert's bastards. Having won three victories, Robb Stark offers the Lannisters peace in exchange for the North's independence, sending Theon to gain Balon Greyjoy's support and Catelyn to seek Renly Baratheon's. Beyond the Wall, the Night's Watch find shelter with the Wildling Craster and his daughter-wives. In Essos, as her people slowly die in the Red Waste, Daenerys sends out riders to look for help.

---

##2.02 - ""The Night Lands""

* Directed By: Alan Taylor
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 8, 2012

Returning to his home of Pyke after nine years as the Starks' ward, Theon Greyjoy is reunited with his sister, Yara, and his father, Balon, who despises Theon for his Northern ways and intends to win back his crown by force. Cersei rejects Robb Stark's terms and Tyrion exiles Janos Slynt, head of the Gold Cloaks, to the Wall, promoting Bronn to commander of the watch. On the road to the Wall, Arya reveals her true identity to Gendry. North of the Wall, Samwell Tarly is approached by one of Craster's daughters, Gilly, who is pregnant and fears for her unborn child; Jon is reluctant to help her despite Sam's pleas. In the Red Waste one of the horses returns to Daenerys with the severed head of its rider in a pouch, a message from one of her enemies. On Dragonstone, Davos Seaworth recruits the pirate Salladhor Saan to Stannis's side, and Stannis has sex with Melisandre to obtain the son his wife cannot give him. Jon discovers that Craster sacrifices his sons to the White Walkers.

I'm not exactly sure how plausible it is, but it could really bring all the viewers up to date on all of the history that hasn't been included in the show so far. Especially with all of the casting rumors of younger characters, this could show the Stark history and relevance to the main story for anyone not familiar with it. It could also show scenes that would be impossible to show if we just stuck to Weirwood trees, like the Tower of Joy. Maybe not an entire flashback episode, but a good amount I think could really reinforce information into the core of the story, and show what's important. This way, known plot elements from the book that aren't in the show can be thrown in without being seen as sudden, as there would have been an entire episode dedicated to history.

I want to talk about something briefly that has been marinating in the back of my mind and until this moment had yet to surface. What about when the snow returns to Westeros after the rain has become cold and a new Targaryen enters the world successfully for the first time in years. Wait. Think about it. 

How great will that moment be for television history? Who stood up when his family was killed and said ""f*** the Wildlings"" (side note watch the gambler - olly got to a state of f***ness or f***itude) he had witnessed first hand these people murder his family. He's a child. Think about being his age, witnessing these atrocities, and pushing forth to castle black and then joining up. He is a brave kid and then he sees injustice and stands up for the watch. Time and time again. 

I challenge everyone to watch just olly time line and put yourself in his shoes. Try harder. I would have given up before I could leave the village, let alone made it to the watch and done half is he stuff be is done. I have finished the show and if you read my beliefs about the upcoming birth, or rebirth I suppose, then you understand fully that anything we think we want to happen to olly as revenge, will most likely be resolved by the very person we are most upset about. Only I see a twist, I don't think the new reborn character will attack his previous slayer. Olly in fact has set him free of his vows as they have now been fulfilled and we are marching towards a much greater westeros. 

In a side note, completely unrelated, is anyone else going to be as sad as I am if/when cersie dies? I know she's not a good person or anything, but I really like watching her actions and seeing her brain at work. She's so clever, strong and proud (not to mention, phenomenal actress - Way to go Lena - thank you - thank everyone who had anything to do with this show! The biggest to the smallest, every contribution is HUGE and you've all changed my life for the better. Thanks so much GRRM!)

But since I seriously do not care about any storyline that involves Sand Snakes, or how Tyrion is gonna manage Mereen and I already know Danerys has too much plot armour for her to be in any serious danger with the Dothraki, I have been focused on one scenario in particular, How does Stannis return from the brink and save Westeros? Well lets get into it shall we. 






First off Brienne is not going to kill him but instead take him as prisoner until she can workout what to do with him. They will travel back to her camp where Podric will say that he saw Sansa and some random guy jump off the castle and the direction they went in. Brienne will ride out to find them, leaving Podric to patch up Stannis' wounds. Once Brienne has found Sansa she will take her with him and Theon will just sought of tag along or sacrifice himself to the Bolton pursuers if there is some. Once back at camp, Stannis will see Sansa and say that they should go to the wall where Sansas' half brother is and is totally alive (not like there's been a mutiny or anything). So then they travel North to the wall presumably pursued by Ramsay or Roose or both and Brienne actually does something by killing them finally somewhat fulfilling her oath to Catelyn. So then they get to the wall to find that the Wildlings have taken over Castle Black, the Wildlings see Stannis at the gates and want to kill him but Brienne has a moment of clarity as she breaks away from her hallucinations of oath keeping for an instant to say she has brought him here for trial to seek justice for her king (Renly) and their king (Mance) before returning to her much loved hallucinations. So they decide to let them enter once their in Sansa asks to see Jon but like all good Starks hes found himself a nice comfy grave to lie in, after hearing this Sansa is pretty devo but the Red Woman comforts her and tells her of her plans. Next scene Stannis is in chains in a cell where he receives a visit from his old mate Davos they have a heart to heart and Davos tells Stannis that the Red Woman plans on resurrecting Jon, Stannis breaks down and tells Davos about what the Red Woman convinced him to do to Shireen, Davos is pissed, but Stannis says he can make it right if he releases him. After convincing Davos Stannis is freed just as the the Red Womans resurrection ceremony is taking place. She is just finishing up as she says ""Now rise Azor Ahai!"" to a resurrected Jon, at that moment Stannis has made his way to her and turned her to face him, he thrusts his sword through her breast like in the Azor Ahai prophecy seeking vengeance for her misleadings. But as he takes the sword out it begins to glow and sear her flesh she utters her final words ""Lightbringer...it is you"" before collapsing to the ground, at this moment the Wildlings see the Sword and know he is the one to lead them to victory over the White Walkers and all of Westeros with Jon and Davos at his side.





If you couldnt tell by now my theory is riddled with too many plot holes to possibly be true and was mostly meant for comic relief after Stannis' pathetic final battle. However I have always been pretty blind to the obvious for example; when Robb Starks wife's baby stomach got stabbed I was like yeah that is fair enough payment for going back on his word, now him and the Freys are even and can work together to destroy the Lannisters. Also when Oberyn had his teeth punched out and was being grappled by the mountain I was just like well he is going to look a bit weird now without teeth but at least he will kill the mountain and rescue Tyrion. I think we all know how those events actually turned out, but if your like me feel free to join in by placing your faith in a absolutely impossible outcome and turning a blind eye to the obvious.

But after he was unceremoniously killed off screen, I had to ask myself, what the hell was the point?

&amp;nbsp;

Stannis' four season long arc seemed to accomplish very little. He never took King's Landing, never inflicted any serious harm to any of the main characters (other than his own family of course), never sat the Iron Throne, etc etc. And yet, we devoted a large amount of screen time and pages to what ultimately turned out to be nothing much. The only thing of major significance that he accomplished was rescuing the Night's Watch from Mance, but even that could have easily been passed off to any other Northern Lord. This all assumes of course that Stannis' book ending is the same as the TV show, which we may not get confirmation of until my unborn children graduate college.

&amp;nbsp;

In the books we hear repeatedly that Stannis is like iron, strong, but not bendable. He would break before he bent, never compromising. This led me to think Stannis would struggle for the throne, sacrificing anything and everything along the way, before failing and joining up with The Others in order to continue his quest to rule. I always felt he meant to rule, no matter the cost or where it took him, and it seemed like they were building towards something along those lines. And while that turned out to be true in a fashion, I don't think there was any payoff for all his bad deeds. 

&amp;nbsp;

In Star Wars, all of Anakin's terrible deeds lead to his downfall and turn to villainy, but just as Stannis was walking down that path, he gets a nice sword to the face. We do not see Stannis suffer for his sins, physically or emotionally, he just gets taken out and that is that. Imagine if Anakin had died immediately after killing Mace Windu or the padawans in the temple, that's how Stannis' storyline played out. No years of leading The Others army, no Theon esque mutilation at the hands of Boltons, just and abrupt ending to a story we were led to believe was going somewhere.

&amp;nbsp;

So again, what was the point of Stannis' story-line? The best reason I could come up with, was as a means to involve Melisandre and her potential resurrection powers for a future Jon Snow return from the grave. But was it all just a long illustration of the futility of seeking the Iron Throne and the consequences of the pursuit of power? Or do we simply chalk up the whole long saga as simply the writers way of teaching us all better grammar?",46,9,False,self,,,,,

I think Gurm spent an incredible amount of time and thought in coming up with character names, and that many of them are particularly meaningful and revealing about a character's purpose, outcome, etc.

**Stark** - German for _rigid_, it's a great name for a family of hardheaded people, and in English, the word _stark_ literally means _harsh_ or _grim_ which makes it even more fitting considering what they go through.

**Robb** -- literally _to steal_. Kind of foreshadows the Red Wedding, no?

**Sanza** -- _sans_ in French, or _sensa_ in Italian, means ""without...""

**Arya** -- is basically the _aria_, an elaborate melody sung solo, without accompaniment. Truly a loner.

**Bran** -- means _raven_ in Gaelic. Points pretty clearly to the 3-eyed raven.

**Lannister** -- I'm betting this is meant to sound like ""sister"", because...

**Jaime** -- literally means ""I love"" in French.  So _J'aime Lannister_ would have come (loosely) from the phrase ""I love my sister.""

**Cersei** -- is exactly ""caesar"" with the syllables reversed. Up to this point, she's been the one ruling, so that fits. Does it hint at her demise?  _Et tu, Brute?_

**Tywin** -- sounds like _Tyrant_. Okay, a little tinfoily, but feels like it fits... but if this were transliterated Russian ( ), it _could_ hint at ""you are to blame"". This is the only Westerosi name I'm aware of that uses the letter i, rather than y, for that sound, which seems important.

**Bronn** -- obviously describes the fact that this guy is little more than hired muscle.

**Aegon** -- to ""egg on"", or provoke. I'd say 

**Aerys** -- _heiress_. Seems pretty obvious.

**Danaerys** -- In many languages, _dan_ means given, making her the _given heiress_. But I also think there's something biblical with Dan, as in _Daniel_ who was unharmed in the lion's den... the Lannisters being lions, of course.

**Fray** -- perfectly chosen name. It means both _fight_ and _coming apart_.

**Walder** -- in German literally means forests, or woodlands. So _Walder Fray_ is a ""fight in the forests,"" or the ""undoing of the woodlands.""

---

I'm sure I could go on... But what I think I find even more interesting in this light is how this might relate to the names chosen for the direwolves:

**Lady** -- Sansa will always be a _Lady_, never a queen. In spite of all the positioning she tries to do, it'll never work out for her.

**Summer** -- Brandon will be the only one to survive the winter.

**Ghost** -- foretells Jon Snow's death, and his return from the dead.

1058,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-11,2015,8,11,6,3gijz6,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] How to save Season 6(?),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3gijz6/everything_how_to_save_season_6/,SigmaQ,1439243017,"Seasons 1-4 are almost unanimously loved, my personal favorite being 4. However, 5 has a tricky reputation with both the TV and reader crowds. Slow, pointless, shock values, poor writing (Dorne the Disaster). Many fans are threatening to stop watching if the show continues the pandering, and assuming the audience is dumb. This piece is mainly personal, but this is how D&amp;D should revamp Game of Thrones so that show watchers can relax with the show and book readers can analyze with the show.

1. **Introduce Euron and Victarion**: Although I have many friends who only watch the show and denounce the Greyjoy's as cruel and useless, I think they are just victim to an undeveloped story. Overall, the Greyjoys need more work. The Yara scene in season 4 was laughably weird, and the Moat Cailin scene was pitiful (not acting nor writing, just scenario and aura for the Greyjoys). Euron is most likely going to be cast for Season 5 with that obvious pirate casting call. I AM REALLY HOPING FOR VICTARION, adding only Euron will give the Greyjoys a more one-sided appearance and Victarion needs to be present to stop the Greyjoys from being plastic. 

2. **Lay off the Sand Snakes**: Dorne is a tragic story. People loved Oberyn, so D&amp;D made Dorne a main selling point for season 5. In practice, this wasn't a bad idea, in fact many books fans were excited to see the Sand Snakes visualized. I won't go into detail on how Dorne was a disaster (watch this video to get all the info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwOoj83j8Cg) but the execution was awful. You want a good show, but you need a bad pussy. 
Here's what you do: Focus on Trystane in King's Landing. He might not have the charm of Oberyn, but his adolescence and inexperience should make a great and colorful role in the Small Council. It would be awesome if he made a mistake or two while advising, and then learn from his mistakes. The only setback is Myrcella's death, and I am hoping he won't be a depressed sob ALL of the season (it would be understandable, but boring as crap to the reader). Even if he might not be the most intelligent, it will be funny to see him argue with old men on how to run a kingdom.

3. **Get to the point with Dany**: Daenerys's story in season 5 is actually awful. Until Tyrion, she is literally moping around Meereen trying to tackle around terrorism in a situation similar to America in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last we saw her, she was arguably captured by Khal Jhaqo. I won't argue theories, but action is inevitable. We should start hearing rumors of Westeros, and connections with Dorne would be awesome. I presume Aegon won't appear since Jorah and Jon Connington were combined. What if Jhaqo allied with Daenerys and compiled ships for her so she can invade with Drogon? (those dragons aren't getting any younger). I can get passed Barristan's death, but only if Dany stops screwing around Slaver's Bay and sets her eyes on Westeros. Introduce more characters from the books, and give her more connections west (Illyrio, Doran, etc). 

I have hope for Season 6. D&amp;D aren't dumb, and even though they have millions of dollars, they shouldn't disrespect the source material like this. ",35,0,False,self,,,,,

I believe that Theon could follow Victarion's later story in the books. In the books Euron Greyjoy is king of the Iron Islands and plans to send his brother with the dragon horn, which summons the dragons to the blower of the horn, to 'steal' Daenarys' dragons. But Euron knows whoever blows the Dragon Horn dies. So he plans to get the dragons and remove his brother Victarion as a threat.

I believe in the show, Theon will return to the iron islands after escaping Ramsey. He will find that his father Balon had died and his uncle Euron now rules the Iron Islands. Euron would find Theon a threat as he is the rightul heir but Euron is clever. He would act like the nice uncle to Theon and give him command of the Iron Fleet. He would then send Theon to lead the iron fleet to mereen, where he would blow the dragon horn and die.

To the viewer it would be a long Theon redemption arc but then in true game of thrones style it would end in tragedy.",24,10,False,self,,,,,

1. That the war will last for years, which is not the case for the war of the 5 kings but could be the case for the war against the white walkers

2. That he will betray the men serving him, which fits Jon Snow better than it fits Stannis as Jon allies the Night's Watch to the wildlings (seen by some as betrayal) and might be on the verge of forsaking his Night's Watch vows entirely or even joining team Wight Walker.

3. She predicts that he will betray his family, this could refer to Jon's decision not to follow Rob into war, or more figuratively his betrayal of his Brothers on the Night's Watch when he deserts them and breaks his vows with Ygritte.

4. Betraying everything you once held dear could be referring to Jon betraying Ygritte for the Night's Watch or betraying the Night's Watch for team White Walker.

To me this fits with the theory that Melisandre is having visions of Jon Stargerian but confusing them for visions of Stannis. As wellas the fact that a lot of the time Melisandre manipulates events to make her predictions about Stannis come true despite them being out of character for him, whereas they apply to Jon Snow without any added help (other than a slightly different interpretation)

Or this list could just be ambiguous enough for it to fit any number of Game of Thrones characters and Melisandre is just being a very convincing false prophet.",1,1,False,default,,,,,

So after the Hardhome episode it is pretty apparent that Valyrian steel is a good thing to have against white walkers. This made me remember a line (might have been in the books) where Sam says that some of the old texts in the Castle Black library state that ""Dragon steel"" is effective against White Walkers, and guesses that Dragon steel Is probably another phrase for Valyrian steel. At this point I'd say it's safe to say he's right... If they knew valyrian steel works against white walkers then it stands to reason that they used it successfully against them the first time around, which kind of confuses me because I was under the impression that the Long Night took place a couple thousand years before Valyria existed... So I guess my main question is how could the first men have used or even been familiar with Valyrian steel thousands of years before the Valyrians were around to create it? Could it have been a pre-existing technology that the Valyrians just sort of made their own and took credit for?",27,26,False,self,,,,,

Howland Reed - Liam Neeson (I think Liam is lacking that GREAT role for a while... usually its just the same action movie and I think he would do great as Reed)
Rhaegar Targaryen - Adam Driver (Probably weird choice.. but I think he could pull it off. He is a great actor and I hope he will be my new favorite villain afte I see new Star Wars

1151,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-12,2015,8,12,3,3gmjyg,self.gameofthrones,[S5E10] The increased emphasis on season finales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3gmjyg/s5e10_the_increased_emphasis_on_season_finales/,Karlzone,1439319236,"I will preface this by saying that I absolutely loved the season finale as it first released, but have come to realize that its rushed nature hurt the season as a whole. The finale of this season contained so many MAJOR events, most of which I feel could have been utilized a lot better. 

It may be a tiny bit unfair because of the difference in time spent filming it, but I will be comparing this episode to the episode 5.8 Hardhome, hopefully it will still serve to illustrate my point. Substitute episode 9 if you wish, they are structured in kind of the same way and are both great.
As I recall Hardhome only contained about two events: Tyrion finally speaking to Dany, and everything leading up to and the actual battle of Hardhome. 
The finale contained: the sudden death of Myrcella, the walk of shame, Arya killing Meryn Trant and losing her eyes, everything leading up to and the battle for Winterfell, the death of Jon Snow. 

These scenes were all very, very well made as well as very important, but they inexplicably did not serve to make this episode nearly as good as Hardhome. As we rushed through these important events, we first of all did not get to catch our breath and fully realize what it meant for the future. Secondly there was very little build up to the scenes themselves. In 5.8 or 5.9 we had most of an episode dedicated to the characters that would very soon be in peril. The amount of time spent on those events further seemed to illustrate how important the coming event it would be. The lack of this time spent cheapened how incredible those events could have been, had they had larger parts of an episode by themselves. 

And this is where I feel the issue lies. The build up this season was quite slow. I personally didn't mind this until I noticed how much was crammed into the last episode. There was so much downtime in the earlier episodes that would have benefited from taking events from the finale and spreading spreading all those out over more episodes. We had an end of episode scene that was wholly dedicated to Jorah Mormont contracting Greyscale, for god's sake. 

Another part of the last episode that was underwhelming was the long hyped battle for Winterfell. I'm not going to mention the Brienne/Stannis scene, as that one has been done enough. What irks me even more about this event is that we never got to wonder whether the the Mannis was going to accomplish something like killing Ramsay, survive or just die. The event is like ""There's not going to be a siege"", camera pans up, cut to Stannis defeated in the woods. There was barely any tension compared to Hardhome and this was a character that we've been invested in for four seasons. What I would have truly loved is this battle going on from purely Stannis' point of view. Ten minutes or even just five minutes of frantic, frustrated fighting while retreating into the woods to the scene we saw. And sure, there are budget concerns, but I feel like it could have worked with enough focus on just Stannis' part of the battle. We didn't need to see the (albeit impressive) bird's eye views of Stannis' army being demolished. We didn't care about his army of sellswords, we cared about the character. This was a huge missed opportunity, just like the following scene that never happened. 

When Mellisandre returned to Castle Black and tells Jon and Davos the bad news, we never get to see Davos (and to a minor extend Jon) truly react to the news. We could have had the most heartfelt weeping/grieving scene of the entire show and it really irks me that they just cut away. This could have also served as a great lead up into Jon Snow's death, an amazing scene that was cheapened because we didn't get to spend enough time to truly become invested in his character again since the massacre of Hardhome. It was like, ""oh yeah here's Jon again and now he's dead"". 

The incredible events of that episode shows us that you can indeed have too much of a good thing all at once. The episode just didn't improve the more events they added to it. And I get it, we all want to see all our beloved characters in the last episode to prepare for the long winter between seasons, but perhaps that should indeed come at the expense of one or two truly important scenes or twists in the episode, as it did in the the first three seasons. Here the last episode was kind of a bridge between seasons and not the climax itself. 

We had the same rushed finale happen in season 4. When the time came for the long awaited death scene of Tywin Lannister, I was already emotionally numb and it barely affected me. The episode hardly improved through that event and might even have been better had there been less events and more time spent on each one. Or at least we could have saved the events for future episodes. Why do we have to round up everything that we set up during the season if it leads to bad pacing? We need to avoid this becoming a trend. I would beg to stop emphasising the season finales of this show so much. Usually the main reason of adding so many gamechanging events in the finales is to keep the hype going in off season and increase the chances of renewal, but that's obviously not going to be a problem for Game of Thrones. So please focus on the overall impact of the scenes in stead of rushing to get them into the finale.

I personnaly think of the High Sparrow as a very intelligent man, even while being a religious fanatic. He wouldn't release Cersei because ""the Gods are good"", I believe he did it because he wanted her to attack him.  
But why would he ever want that? Now, if them High Sparrow wanted to take over the crown, he wouldn't be able to simply walk up to the Red Keep, even with every man, woman and child from King's Landing. Hundreds would die. Thousands! And he would most likely loose, if he would even get every low born from King's Landing to fight for him.  
**However**, if a small army comes knocking at the High Sparrow's door to kill him, all it would take would be 10 peasants to attack a soldier that hell would break loose, and the crown's soldiers would be vastly overwhelmed. And I believe that's what will happen, or at the very least what the High Sparrow will attempt to do.  
But OP, why would the High Sparrow imprison Margaery and Loras as well? Wouldn't he be finding unnecessary problems with the Tyrels?  
Well, I think the High Sparrow did that to get Cersei's trust to eventually imprison her, and also to give Tommen another reason to try to kill him, since he's in love with Margaery. I'm very unsure on this bit though, maybe he just did it because they are siners before his eyes.  
As for the title, I confess I'm guilty of a slight click bait, but I do believe the High Sparrow wants the Iron Throne. However, I don't think he wants Westeros, I think he wants King's Landing to become his little religious city of some sort.  
Now, all of this are just the High Sparrow's intentions, I do not think this will actually happen. I think Tommen will somehow end up dying (I can't think of a way, really), and then Cersei will go crazy with the civil war and want to burn the city to the ground. As Jaime hears her give these huge speeches about killing everyone and burning everything to the ground, he realizes his very sister, the woman he loved his whole life is becoming into the Mad Queen, and he ends up killing her, choking her to be precise (cause prophecy). This wouldn't really end the civil war, and at this point I would expect Kevan to take over and win the civil war with the help of the Tyrels, or maybe Daenerys could show up, who knows?  
So yeah, that's my not so detailed guess of what will happen as far as King's Landing goes. If you see any plot holes or mistakes with my theory feel free to point them out.",7,2,False,self,,,,,

Then imagine you're Joffrey, and you're ready to take the throne after your dad dies, and Ned comes up and says you shouldn't get the throne because actually you're the product of incest, that you're not the son of King Robert but actually the son of your uncle and his sister.

-I really liked Jorah, I remember him being my absolute favorite character. I just really enjoyed his silent, sullen, badass ways. (The Mormont Way... c: ) 
-I also really liked Sam. I have a very strange place in my heart for young men and boys who haven't a place in the world, and Sam really fits that description. I also have a soft spot for that one character who really is just a dude who is most certainly not fit for the situation. Kind of like Samwise from The Lord of the Rings. (An odd parallel there don't you think, Martin? c; )
-I enjoyed other characters of course, Tyrion, Arya, The Hound, Jaime, but I think my first time through Jorah and Sam really rang in as my absolute favorites.

My SECOND time through, things changed a lot!

Of course I still enjoyed Sam and Jorah, but I found a lot more love for characters who I didn't before.

-Jon's true honorable badassness is so powerful during every moment of the show. I truly love Jon with all my heart, and it makes knowing his fate all the more painful.
-Theon, surprisingly, is another favorite of mine from the second time through. One line in particular really turned my thoughts on him around... 
""My real father lost his head in King's Landing."" https://youtu.be/CYhTFbd_NhI?t=177 Nothing but a lost Ironborn raised as a Wolf, and shunned by everyone around him... I don't like Theon for what he did. But I feel for him. Another boy with no where to belong to in this world.
-Tyrion's sassiness made me laugh three times as harder than I did the first time through. I seriously couldn't wait to get back into season 2 during his Hand days. Seeing him make good friends with Varys is fun, listening to Tyrion and Bronn banter is awesome, and watching Tyrion slap the living hell out of Joffrey is incredibly satisfying. 

To be honest the list goes on a lot longer than this, but I'd like to hear who are some of your favorites, whether its your first time through or your second time through, or hell, your eighth time through! ",52,28,False,self,,,,,

However, now that S6 will likely include the Greyjoys, if the theory is true, how would D&amp;D cast Euron Greyjoy? Would they just shave Daario's beard and have him play Euron?

Sam is learning to become a Maester. Maesters have a Valyrian Steel link on their chains. Sam is obviously learning to forge Valyrian steel so he can make Lightbringer. That's also why he brought Gilly with him. He needs to use her to quench his blade instead of using typical oil.

Please correct me if I've made any violations.

I have a pretty far-fetched theory. 

Gist: Starks are the villains. Jon Snow will lead the Others as the Night's King to make an everlasting winter.

What if the Starks are the villains of A Song of Fire and Ice. We know the Starks through Ned, but this image of the honorable men of the north is false. Their history suggest a more ruthless ancestry. How could the Starks rule over the houses of the north like the Bolton, Karstarks, Umber, etc, if they are not the feared for their ruthlessness and military prowess. It is known that the Houses of the North will only recognize the warden of the North if he/she is named a Stark.

Ned in fact does not portray the true Starks. Ned is Stark by blood but is an Arryn at heart. He was raised by Jon Arryn whose house words are *cough cough* ""As High as Honor"".

True representation of the Starks are shown through Arya. Arya seeks revenge. She will do everything to avenge her family. Not really honorable, right? 

Here's another example. 
Rob chose his dick over his honor. (On the show that is.)

Having said all that, Jon was betrayed and died in the hands of his brothers. He will be resurrected as a an Other and will lead them to crush all the houses of Westeros. Well that's what a true Stark would do, right Arya?

This theory might not hold water but still I'm just hoping for the biggest curve ball that G.R.R. Martin can throw at us.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

Jaime is highly touted all over Westeros, but the only action we see of him is versus Ned. Ned shows no fear of him and holds his own against Jaime. Ned also calls Jaime out twice.(vid links follow) To me it seems like Jaime uses his reputation for intimidation and only fights when faced with a lesser opponent. Who has he beaten in single combat?

Going further, lady Olenna also calls Tywin out for not being as rich as his reputation suggests. I see the Lannister's as a house built on reputation more than substance. Tywin seems to know the importance of this based on his speeches with Jaime. I think with Tywin gone the facade will show through. The Lannister's are con men, just like Lan the Clever!

Jon's fate meant a lot for to me the second time around. I appreciated the character a hell of lot more than I did the first time through, and I found myself losing it a little bit when the Stark's leitmotif is blaring over the sound of daggers being plunged into Jon's chest. Needless to say the Stark leitmotif brought back memories of many other Stark deaths, and the floodgates opened into a river of sadness. 

When Hot Pie starts work at the Inn at the Crossroads and hands Arya the wonderfully crafted Wolf shaped bread, I just felt kind of happy-sad. This nobody of a little boy from Flea Bottom finally finds his place in the world. Doing what he loves, and doing it well. Needless to say when Brienne and Podd meet Azor Hot Pie on their way to the Vale, I had the same reaction.

In tenure, he's been playing the game of thrones longer than everyone else, since Tywin is now dead. 
He has been the Grand Maester for four kings, the first being Aerys II. When Robert's rebellion came, Pycelle convinced Aerys to open the gates to Tywin--even though the other advisers on the small council told the king not to trust the Lord of Casterly rock. 

When Tyrion decided to seize him for spying, he blurted out his claim to their family, stating:

&gt;""All I did, I did for House Lannister! Always! Your lord father, ask him! I've always been his servant, since the days of the Mad King!""


As Grand Maester he was present at the birth of all of Cersei's children--trusting someone to lead the midwives through the birth of your sovereign is a great trust that cannot be dismissed. As Maester, he is well versed in medicine and knowledge to know that it was poison that killed Jon Arryn. But instead of hiding the book from Eddard Stark (the book that Jon was reading before being killed) he loans it to him. Giving a suspicious friend the information needed to figure out the illegitimate lineage of the children is rather sly, he's virtually dipping his fingers into multiple pots of honey. A style we only associate with Little Finger. Are we dismissing him because he appears old? That is a mask he wears.

Pycelle pulled at the strings again concerning assassinating Dany, driving home to Robert that it was 'kinder to kill her now, before thousands had to die'. He fate would be immediate if a Targaryean came into power again. 
With Qyburn rising in importance to Cersei's cause, especially down that her zombie-guard is in her power--Pycelle is threatened. Pycelle can be replaced--has been replaced.  Pycelle's protection is tied to the Lannisters, what will he do now? Will be make bolder and bolder moves?

The reference was about the last scene where Jon got tricked with uncle Benjen being back and got stabbed to death. So they kinda just said that Jon died there in that scene.

For me it was no problem since I'm an avid series watcher and I saw the series for sure and therefore I appreciate that reference, because it fit perfectly for that plotline.

The episode discussion thread however escalated quickly with people being spoiled in a huge way and complaining about how Suits fucked that one up. I understand them and would feel the same way if I get spoiled that hard. 

The thing now is, some people said that the season finale aired 2 months ago so everybody should be up to date. Again, I understand that point of view, too.

I was just thinking about what's going to happen next season after all the tumultuous events at the end of last season.  Now that the Night's watch have killed Jon Snow for being a 'traitor', the next thing they're going to want to do is to get the Wildlings back on the other side of the Wall.  However, they clearly lack the numbers to do so, since they have only about 50 men while the Wildlings number in the thousands.

Similarly, the Boltons now seem secure at Winterfell.  They've lost Sansa for the time being, but there's no other immediate threats on the horizon after their defeat of Stannis.  Surely they are due for a comeuppance, but they're safely holed up at Winterfell and/or the Dreadfort.  So we need some way to draw them out.

So I was wondering if these two problems might be related.  If the Night's Watch needs help dealing with the Wildlings, the first thing they're going to do is go to Winterfell and the other northern castles for assistance.  And the Boltons are obliged to help them: the only thing Northerners hate more than Southerners are the wildlings, and the Boltons need to establish legitimacy of their rule now that they're not getting any more support from the south.

So I was thinking that the following scenario comes to pass: the Night's Watch requests aid from the Northern lords in driving back the Wildlings.  The Boltons, shirts and all, march up to the Wall to go murder some wildlings, expecting as easy a fight as Stannis'.  However, the other Northerners (like the Umbers), egged on by Sansa, seize their opportunity and surprise-attack the Boltons from the rear.  The Night's Watch, seeing all the commotion, think the Boltons are attacking the Wildlings and decide to join in.  The Wildlings, already riled up about Jon's murder, lose their shit and just start attacking everyone.  It all devolves into mass mayhem and pretty much everyone kills everyone, leaving a nice big pile of corpses for the White Walkers to reanimate.

What do you all think?  Are there any other ideas for what'll happen next season?",13,15,False,self,,,,,

The show has various fantastical elements like dragons, zombies, and magic, yet all of those things seem to have rules that operate within the boundaries of realism. But as Bronn points out, whores never turn down payment. Even if Podrick were - against all odds - some sort of sex god, they'd still have to charge him because it's their job, and ya know Littlefinger would fire them and/or kill them if they're out there giving freebies. 

First thought I had was that Podrick lied. For some reason after Tyrion and Bronn left, he declined to have sex with the girls, and made up the story later to explain why he still had the money. Maybe Pod's not into chicks? But no, he displays a clear interest in women when [Season 5](#s ""he checks out the waitress at the tavern where they find Sansa."") Then it hit me.


tl;dr: Tyrion had already paid them ahead of time, and told them to pretend they wouldn't accept payment because Pod was so amazing. The sack of gold he gave Pod was just part of the ruse. Why? To build up Pod's confidence. Buy a man a whore, he has sex for a day. Instill a man with confidence, he'll have sex... more often. Or something.

I was reading a bit more into the jaqen=syrio theory. Whilst doing this I was watching episode 8 of the 1st season, around the part where arya is about to be taken by meryn Trant and his boys. Should've been quite easy but syrio managed to get through them all leaving Trant left standing. He then says to arya something like ""what do we say to the God of death?"" ""Not today"" she replies. So that's that scene done, and soon after its the scene where ned is locked up and varys comes to visit him. I dunno the context before hand but ned says to varys ""just slit my throat and be done with it"" (basically death). Varys then says ""not today, my lord"". Is this just a coincidence or is there something more behind it? This has probably been noticed and posted here before , and if so i apologise, but it definitely makes me believe the theory even more. Only thing I'm confused about is where does varys come into this? Can't the many faced God only use the face of a dead person? That really should answer my own question but I'm reading right now that varys apparently has ties to the faceless men which is why I'm so damn confused.  Anyone got anything more on this?

Cersei's fate, and so Tommen's fate, depends on the trial by combat that is to come. Since Cleganebowl is FUCKING CONFIRMED, we can say Tommen's place as king depends on whether Robert Strong wins against Sandor--but what better the end to a revenge story than Sandor winning? Gregor's already won one trial by combat against someone wanting vengeance. Time to lose for once, buddy.

And if Sandor loses, the main Lannister line is fucked forever. Cersei will be horribly executed, and worse, so will Tommen. We've already seen how helpless little Tommen is to the Sparrows.

[The White Walkers/Others](https://dappercadaver.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thrones-210-white-walker.jpg) have been [described by GRRM](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others) as such:
 
*The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful think, oh the Sidhe made of ice, something like that a different sort of life inhuman, elegant, dangerous.* 

The White Walkers are alive and intelligent. They haven't been seen for thousands of years, and we don't yet know why they are active now. We know very little about them, except that they are vulnerable to dragonglass and now, Valyrian steel. GRRM has said that we will be traveling further north in the next book and will learn more about them. Hopefully that means in the next season, as well.

[The wights](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120604080035/gameofthrones/images/8/80/Wight01_2x10.jpg) are their zombie minions. They are the reanimated dead flesh that they use as their army of the dead. We don't know how many White Walkers there are currently but they don't seem to have great numbers that we've seen. The number of wights, however, is limitless, as we saw in Hardhome. 

Because wights are dead, they can't really be ""killed"" easily. They are vulnerable to fire, but beyond that you pretty much have to chop them up to get them to stop moving (or stomp them if you happen to be a giant). A disembodied arm or leg will continue to move. 

It's unknown how much consciousness/intelligence they have, if any. The only thing I can think of that hints at independent thought is when the wight went to LC Mormont's quarters to kill him in the first season, but then we don't really know the full mechanics there. Can a wight be programmed or told what to do ahead of time? It's worth discussing. 

One thing I do want to address, though, is that a Jon Snow that's raised as a wight is not a resurrected Jon. It's Jon's body being used by the White Walkers, but it's still basically a dead body. As for Jon being resurrected as a White Walker? I don't think we know yet if that's possible. The only person we've seen converted to a WW was a living baby. If a dead person can be converted to a WW, we haven't seen it yet.

Hope this helps someone who might be confused.",37,52,False,self,,,,,

According to [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj_uNZmcJaTddG9BVU5tRnJJTE5KcE5JRkFha1ZfNUE#gid=8) timeline:

* Danny was 13 when she married to Drogo. And about 15 when she became the queen of Meereen.

* Robb was 15 when Red Wedding happened.

* Sam was 17 when he arrived at Oldtown.

* Jon was about 17 when he was elected LC.

What I want to say is that, it's so hard to picture all these characters with such a young age. Maybe I'm influenced by the TV show, I always picture them way more older than their actual age. I don't think this alter the story, all I need to know is that those characters are very young and don't have too much experience.

How about you? What do you think about the ""actual age"" and how do you deal with it?

(btw, thanks to the TV show, it's impossible for me to picture Ned as a 31 man, same age as Jaime)

edit: Ned is actually ~3 years older than Jaime...

This is seriously my favorite video I've ever made. And I wouldn't have made it so badass if you guys didn't praise me so much for my other one. So thank you all.

Martin himself has said that the books were loosely based off the war of the roses. If we are to assume that the house of York in the north is house stark, and that house Lancaster in the south is in fact the targaryens, my question for all of you is do you think that with the R+L=J theory, that J could in fact be the fantasy equivalent of the first Tudor king?

* Directed By: Alik Sakharov

Catelyn Stark arrives at King Renly's camp to negotiate an alliance, and the woman warrior Brienne of Tarth wins the right to join Renly's guard. Balon Greyjoy makes plan to attack the North, led by Yara. Theon protests that he should lead the attack and Yara tells him that he must choose between them and the Starks. After burning a letter warning Robb Stark of his father's impending attack, Theon re-joins the Greyjoys in a water-based ceremony. Tyrion crafts a plan to find who is in Cersei's confidence by proposing three different marriages to the members of the Small Council. At Winterfell, Bran Stark needs help to decipher his dreams. On the road to the wall, the band of Night's Watch recruits are attacked by Lannister soldiers. Yoren is killed and Arya is taken prisoner.

&gt;""The usurper Robb Stark, the usurper Balon Greyjoy, the usurper Joffrey Baratheon.""

In S3E10 Robb is discovered to be dead and Stannis and Mel both take that as confirmation of the red god/fire magic's power. Davos points out that men die all the time in war.

Later, Joffrey also dies. But at the time of Stannis's death in S5 Balon Greyjoy is still (as far as we know) alive and kicking.

Balon's an old man, it's not like it would be difficult for a god to give him a heart attack. Stannis and Mel didn't technically put a time limit on the deaths but I think it was heavily implied that they should die a long time before Stannis himself did.

There was a fair bit of selection bias at work here, Stannis didn't pick 3 men at random, he picked men who were trying to claim the title of King for themselves and who naturally had a lot of enemies. That only 2/3 of them died is far better proof *against* the power of fire magic/kings blood than it is in favour of it.

Mel is definitely a witch with certain powers of her own, but is Balon's continued existence proof that the power of king's blood and fire magic are bull?",17,0,False,self,,,,,

2) Why would learning that Jon *ISN'T* Ned Starks son increase the likelihood that the Northern Lords will rally around him? They're hardly Targaryean loyalists, so Rhaegars son isn't going to be all that inspiring. Especially since they believe he kidnapped and raped a Stark. I'm guessing it's actually pretty dangerous being a Targaryean in the North. Also, Lyannas children aren't in the line of succession, and they have Neds daughter to rally around, if they're inclined to rally.

According to the explanation, the thin man takes the ""premium"", but refuses to pay the compensation (the ""claim"") in case an accident occurs to the captain. OK, fair enough - he's a scammer, and the family resort to the Faceless Men. His life is decided to be taken.

HOWEVER, in the TV show, based on what Arya has seen, and that's what Jaqen said 'she would see' [which means Arya would see for herself the thin man is the wrongdoer], what did she see?

99% of the explanations go by ""the man did not pay the captain's family"" (!?!) In the scene, the captain made his 18th successful voyage, 'without a scratch', and is still alive, how come the thin man have to pay?

When Arya was there to see, it seems that the captain wants to buy the ""insurance service"" but the thin man refuses to take the ""premium"" (thus declining to provide his 'insurance' service).

This is totally legitimate in real life. In many cases, it would be a wise decision of the insurance firm, as the deal is too risky.
Or - they will do it, it's just that the premium will be ridiculously high, that for the insured it's not worth buying insurance that way. Anyway, insurance is all about risk (probability) assessment and risk-loving/risk-aversion.

Looks like the captain wants to buy insurance for his 19th/future voyage(s), but got turned down by the thin man. The captain showing that he returned from his 18th voyage is pretty much like a driver showing the insurance firm that he has a clean record (no accidents, no pulled-over, no claim before...), so that he would get the low premium fee.

But the thin man is not a wrongdoer if we just base ONLY on what Arya has seen for herself. He simply doesn't 'take the bet'. Every words that judge him are from Jaqen's mouth.

Why did the show producer make it so confusing like that?",20,21,False,self,,,,,

It is said that her sacrifice allowed Stannis to win the coming up war with the Boltons, but some fans have speculated that her death may have granted something else: Jon Snows resurrection as Azor Ahai.

As the season was coming to end, Melisandres faith in Stannis was burning out. When she finds out that half of Stannins army has abandoned him, she makes her way back to Castle Black, shortly before Jon Snows death.
I will be breaking this theory up into bits, so it is a little easier to explain.

**Why does Mel think Jon is Azor Ahai?**

In ADWD, without spoiling too much, Melisandre says:
&gt; I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and Rhllor shows me only Snow. 

Her visions, which are not always true, show that Rhllor is showing Snow (with a capital S) as Azor Ahai. One problem with this is that Snow could signify anyone, and right now it is unclear who this might be, but for now lets assume it is Jon Snow.

**How does Shireen come into this?**

To fulfill the prophecy of Azor Ahai, Melisandre sacrificed Shireen, so she can save Jon, and he can be reborn as AA. Take a look at the prophecy:
When the red star bleeds  Ser Patrek's bloody body with stars in the sky.

And darkness gathers,  Either that winter is coming per the white raven, or the Nights Watch.

Azor Ahai shall be born amidst smoke and salt  Bowens salty tears and Jon's smoking wounds.

To wake dragons out of stone.  Shireen has the stone man's disease and has king's blood (There is power in the Kings Blood).

Shireen's stone man's disease and king's blood will help in the ressureciton of Jon.
Jon will be on the verge of death and Mel sacrificed Shireen to save Jon, fulfilling the prophecy and therefore Jon will be reborn as AA.

**How will Melisandre save Jon?**

It can be no coincide that Melisandre has left the king she believed in for such a long time, and arrived just before Jon Snows death. Some say that she saw the death of Jon in her visions before, and lied to Stannis, in order for him to sacrifice Shireen.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

White Walkers, Dragons, Melisandre and anything else to do with the Lord of Light are the prominent focuses of the story. I feel the name of the TV show ""Game of Thrones"" (after the first book) makes a false implication that the Iron Throne has a real purpose right now and in the future of the series. 

The throne was not displayed at all during Season 5. Right now the active leadership is a child King who won't come out of his room led by Kevan Lannister whose character has not received any type of development in the show aside from Cersei saying he ""has the courage of a kitchen mouse"". 

There is a lot of discussion about who will take the throne away from the Lannisters, but I personally feel we have seen the last of the Iron Throne until King's Landing falls into absolute ruin (Bran's vision).

I watch the show and I scavenge the internet for GoT book content, background information, etc... (often on Youtube).

The show for some reason didn't mention the valonqar prophecy, however, I thought of something that actually makes sense. This theory has probably already been formulated. If so, let me know what you think about it.

First of all, apparently the prophecy says ""the valonqar"" meaning that it won't necessarily be cersei's brother(s). In the book, it's speculated that cersei will choose Robert Strong (reborn Mountain) as her champion. This leads me to believe that the valonqar is actually Sandor Clegane, the Hound.

CLEGANEBOWL CONFIRMED.

Sandor would fit nicely as the ""littlebrother"" who kills cersei indirectly by killing his older brother. This in turn, will lead to cersei's execution. GRRM has often stated that these prophecies may come true but in unexpected ways. He also makes it clear that people who can see visions (such as Melissandre) in the book, often misinterpret what they see. Maggy the Frog might be talking about the metaphorical strangling of Cersei and her indirect death by the valonqar (the Hound).

We already know that the Hound could still be alive as the ""gravedigger"". However, the other section of the prophecy leaves this theory in doubt. If she does, indeed, die after trial by combat, this would leave little room for Tommen to die and the ""younger beautiful"" Queen to take everything she holds dear. Some may argue that Margery is that Queen and that she has already taken from Cersei, however, I don't think Margery has done anything extreme yet to harm Cersei. 

Of course, Tommen could still die. Maybe Margery will win her trial and the Tyrell's and Littlefinger will plot to kill Tommen in order to leave Margery as sole power of the throne.

My apologies.

What if Dany was Jon's twin sister? Non identical of course. If she and Jon were both born at the tower of Joy--he with dark hair, and she with white hair--Ned would have to give her up. He couldn't hide a blonde, purple eyed child among the dark haired people of the north. There is an interesting time line concerning Dany's birth, which lines up perfectly with Jon's birth.

First, lets visit Rhaella Targaryen's motives. She isn't a fan of her husband's behavior. Take this quote concerning her rape, which her maids cleaned up afterwards-describing it similar to a butchered animal.
&gt;She was unhappily married to her brother Aerys. It is said that one time when Jaime Lannister was on guard at their door he was forced to listen to Aerys rape Rhaella and was unable to do anything to stop it, while the other Kingsguard refused to intervene.

We can only assume, as I cannot find direct evidence-that Rhaella loved her children. Rhaella's anger concerning her husband/brother, may have propelled her to side with Rhaegar concerning a possible coup in the future. Rhaegar is quoted as saying:
&gt;When  the battle's done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I  meant to do it long ago, but ... well, it does no good to speak of roads  not taken. We shall talk when I return.- Rhaegar to Jaime

If we believed in R+L=J&amp;..., and that Lyanna Stark died giving birth to two children at the Tower of Joy, then we can see that the births of both Jon and Dany are very close in time. Jon is shown as being born in 283AC, and Dany in 284AC, what if they adjusted Dany's date of birth? It would assist in hiding Dany's true parentage. Rhaella had lost Rhaegar, but she could possess his last remaining child. The real question would be, did she tell anyone? Did she tell Viserys? 

&gt;After the death of Rhaegar in the Battle of the Trident, Rhaella and Prince Viserys fled to the Targaryens ancestral seat of Dragonstone. Aerys would perish during the Sack of King's Landing, while Rhaella died giving birth to Daenerys during a great storm.

If she didn't tell Viserys, then the secret may have died with her.

&gt;Daenerys's mother was sent to safety on Dragonstone island just before the Sack of King's Landing, and died giving birth to her during a great storm which wrecked the remaining Targaryen fleet at anchor, earning her the sobriquet Daenerys Stormborn. 

I think Rhaella told Viserys about his 'sister'. If Targaryen kings marry their sisters, then why did Viserys give up Dany so easily.
&gt;According to Viserys Targaryen, Rhaegar was simply not happy with his marriage. If Rhaegar was happy with Elia, he would not have needed Lyanna. He once blamed their sister Daenerys Targaryen for being born too late to marry Rhaegar. A happily married Rhaegar would need neither Elia nor Lyanna. Daenerys countered that, by the same logic, it was the fault of Viserys that he was not a girl, because then he would be the sister destined for Rhaegar. Viserys beat her cruelly for her insolence

Could it be that Viserys knew of Dany's bastard lineage, and he determined that she wasn't worth keeping? Marrying her off on pretenses of building an army would serve a better purpose than keeping a half-blood sister.

Just a few thoughts.",74,11,False,self,,,,,

They both have Lannisters as hand of the kings (coincidence i don't think so). and both have barristan selmy as lord commander of their kingsguard (coincidence again really ?)

1758,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-19,2015,8,19,3,3hh9zb,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] Is democracy the end game for Westeros?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3hh9zb/all_spoilers_is_democracy_the_end_game_for/,[deleted],1439923320,"Ok guys, this theory has a lot of moving parts, so stick with me, but is the end result for Westeros some form of democracy? I am more than halfway through my third read through of the novels, and so I am racking my brain at this point for the broad strokes of the finale to the series. I love nothing more than to chat theories,as long as they aren't mega crazy, (I'm looking at you Tyrion womb/time travelling theory,) so comment below and let's discuss!

&amp;nbsp;

Ok so as I read through, I am trying to figure out what will ultimately be Westeros' fate. The books make repeated points about the suffering of the common folk when the lords play their ""game of thrones"" and about their overall dissatisfaction with the system. We all keep asking, who will end up on the Iron Throne, but I am starting to think there will be no Iron Throne. But what does that mean for the fate of the two most likely to plant their butts in the world's most uncomfortable chair? I think their fates and character arcs hint at what is to come.

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming Jon Snow is Jon Targaryen, and he will be resurrected in some fashion, either by Melisandre, or some other way, he seems a likely candidate to sit the Iron Throne someday. But this leaves out a key fact that I think most of us choose to ignore. Whenever someone is resurrected in Westeros, be it Beric Dondarrion, Khal Drogo, or Catelyn Stark, they come back as less than they were. So while I do believe Jon will return, it seems likely that he will return as less than he was.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the degree of his return might leave him capable of being the focal point of war with The Others, it doesn't necessarily mean that he will still be fit to be King of the Seven Kingdoms after what I assume is an eventual victory for our heroes. Thinking in terms of JRR Tolkien's influence on Martin, the analogy here would be Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the hero of the story, and yet takes no joy in the victory. Frodo is too damaged, emotionally and physically, to reap the rewards, and eventually sails to the Undying Lands. Doesn't that sound a little like Jon?

&amp;nbsp;

Now what about Dany? We have to take a look a Dany's entire arc to see where she might end up. I think things will end up better for Dany than they did for Jon, but still not great. After the war to come, I believe Dany will end up ELECTED as some type of leader of Westoros, be it Prime Minister, President, or something of the like. Why wouldn't she simply RULE you ask?

&amp;nbsp;

Dany has seen first hand the troubles of ruling a land she conquered in Mereen, and has seen the struggles of Westoros, or ""The Wheel"" as she likes to call it. Her desire to break the wheel will lead to the founding of the democracy, in some shape or form. Dany has shown a desire to break the cycles of the old world, slavery, the game of thrones, etc along with a strong compassion for the common folk that sets her apart from most of the great houses. When the freed slaves followed her from Astapor, to Yunkai, to Mereen, she did nothing to dissuade them despite the strain it put on her food and supplies.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think Dany believes installing herself as queen would be considered breaking the wheel, but she doesn't quite have the idea of democracy yet. So where would she get the basic idea for democracy? We circle back around to Jon, brother of the Night's Watch, (or former brother considering his death,) where they VOTE for their leader. Theoretically Jon and Dany will team in order to fight The Others at some point, and afterwards it's not hard to imagine Jon suggesting some sort of vote similar to the NW's in order to choose the next leader of Westeros.

&amp;nbsp;

Opposite of how he was chosen to be Lord Commander, I think Jon will instead support Dany to lead as the first PM, Pres, or what not. For added incentive, remember Dany believes herself unable to bear children. What's the point for her installing herself as queen if her house dies with her? What about Jon having kids? Possible, but remember Jon's death and rebirth will leave him scarred, and probably unable to have children as well. So Dany could see a democracy as means to break the wheel both on moral grounds, and as a means to set Westeros up for the future.

&amp;nbsp; 

Also take into consideration of Dany's vision in the House of the Undying that saw the throne room in King's Landing broken and covered in snow. It's highly likely that KL's is destroyed in the war with The Others, and what could be more symbolic than the destruction of the old world to usher in the world of the new? Last, with the type of European history buff that Martin is, a sprouting of democracy in place of old monarchies along the lines of the death of monarchies in European history doesn't seem that out of place.

&amp;nbsp; 

This a VERY BROAD theory, and so the details might adjust here or there, but seems likely to come to fruition at some point. What does everyone think?

1762,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-19,2015,8,19,3,3hhc9d,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] [EVERYTHING] Is democracy the end game for Westeros?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3hhc9d/all_spoilers_everything_is_democracy_the_end_game/,CourtsideCorey,1439924204,"Ok guys, this theory has a lot of moving parts, so stick with me, but is the end result for Westeros some form of democracy? I am more than halfway through my third read through of the novels, and so I am racking my brain at this point for the broad strokes of the finale to the series. I love nothing more than to chat theories,as long as they aren't mega crazy, (I'm looking at you Tyrion womb/time travelling theory,) so comment below and let's discuss!

&amp;nbsp;

Ok so as I read through, I am trying to figure out what will ultimately be Westeros' fate. The books make repeated points about the suffering of the common folk when the lords play their ""game of thrones"" and about their overall dissatisfaction with the system. We all keep asking, who will end up on the Iron Throne, but I am starting to think there will be no Iron Throne. But what does that mean for the fate of the two most likely to plant their butts in the world's most uncomfortable chair? I think their fates and character arcs hint at what is to come.

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming Jon Snow is Jon Targaryen, and he will be resurrected in some fashion, either by Melisandre, or some other way, he seems a likely candidate to sit the Iron Throne someday. But this leaves out a key fact that I think most of us choose to ignore. Whenever someone is resurrected in Westeros, be it Beric Dondarrion, Khal Drogo, or Catelyn Stark, they come back as less than they were. So while I do believe Jon will return, it seems likely that he will return as less than he was.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the degree of his return might leave him capable of being the focal point of war with The Others, it doesn't necessarily mean that he will still be fit to be King of the Seven Kingdoms after what I assume is an eventual victory for our heroes. Thinking in terms of JRR Tolkien's influence on Martin, the analogy here would be Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the hero of the story, and yet takes no joy in the victory. Frodo is too damaged, emotionally and physically, to reap the rewards, and eventually sails to the Undying Lands. Doesn't that sound a little like Jon?

&amp;nbsp;

Now what about Dany? We have to take a look a Dany's entire arc to see where she might end up. I think things will end up better for Dany than they did for Jon, but still not great. After the war to come, I believe Dany will end up ELECTED as some type of leader of Westoros, be it Prime Minister, President, or something of the like. Why wouldn't she simply RULE you ask?

&amp;nbsp;

Dany has seen first hand the troubles of ruling a land she conquered in Mereen, and has seen the struggles of Westoros, or ""The Wheel"" as she likes to call it. Her desire to break the wheel will lead to the founding of the democracy, in some shape or form. Dany has shown a desire to break the cycles of the old world, slavery, the game of thrones, etc along with a strong compassion for the common folk that sets her apart from most of the great houses. When the freed slaves followed her from Astapor, to Yunkai, to Mereen, she did nothing to dissuade them despite the strain it put on her food and supplies.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think Dany believes installing herself as queen would be considered breaking the wheel, but she doesn't quite have the idea of democracy yet. So where would she get the basic idea for democracy? We circle back around to Jon, brother of the Night's Watch, (or former brother considering his death,) where they VOTE for their leader. Theoretically Jon and Dany will team in order to fight The Others at some point, and afterwards it's not hard to imagine Jon suggesting some sort of vote similar to the NW's in order to choose the next leader of Westeros.

&amp;nbsp;

Opposite of how he was chosen to be Lord Commander, I think Jon will instead support Dany to lead as the first PM, Pres, or what not. For added incentive, remember Dany believes herself unable to bear children. What's the point for her installing herself as queen if her house dies with her? What about Jon having kids? Possible, but remember Jon's death and rebirth will leave him scarred, and probably unable to have children as well. So Dany could see a democracy as means to break the wheel both on moral grounds, and as a means to set Westeros up for the future.

&amp;nbsp; 

Also take into consideration of Dany's vision in the House of the Undying that saw the throne room in King's Landing broken and covered in snow. It's highly likely that KL's is destroyed in the war with The Others, and what could be more symbolic than the destruction of the old world to usher in the world of the new? Last, with the type of European history buff that Martin is, a sprouting of democracy in place of old monarchies along the lines of the death of monarchies in European history doesn't seem that out of place.

&amp;nbsp; 

This a VERY BROAD theory, and so the details might adjust here or there, but seems likely to come to fruition at some point. What does everyone think?

This isn't said in the TV show, but in the first book of Game of Thrones, Jorah tells Daenerys that widowed Khaleesis live out the rest of their lives in Vaes Dothrak as Dosh Khaleens (seers). After his death, Daenerys was supposed to go Vaes Dothrak, but instead was abandoned by a huge number of her Khalasar. My theory is that the reason they didn't take her back to Vaes Dothrak and just abandoned her was because of the black magic ritual she performed trying to save Khal Drogo's life. 

Now, the reason I believe that she's being taken back to Vaes Dothrak is because the Dothraki that found her wasn't a Khalasar, but an army. This is evident because in the scene where they are circling around her, there are no woman, children or supply carts. Another evidence that supports my theory of this being an army rather than a Khalasar is because it known that the Dothraki always sends out a few scouts to scout ahead to make sure there aren't any enemies waiting to attack their Khalasar. However, the huge number of riders that we saw in Daenerys's last scene indicates that these aren't just scouts of a Khalasar because who would send that many scouts?

I believe that the word of her being the Mother of Dragons and the conquering of three cities must have reached the ears of the Dothraki by now. There is no way an accomplishment like conquering three cities would go unnoticed as most of the high lords in Westeros already know what Daenerys is doing. But why an army to bring back one single widowed Khaleesi? My guess is that it is a combination of knowing her conquering of 3 cities, her being the mother of dragons and the fact that she was Khaleesi to Khal Drogo (the Khal who was known to have commanded the biggest Khalasar). That's why I think they are taking her to Vaes Dothrak and why that army was circling around her. Maybe in the future, she'll convince all the Khalasars to unite, and with the help of her unsullied, she will go to Westeros? What do you guys think?

This application contains SPOILERS for anyone not caught up in either the book or the TV series.

Another user posted recently how it is interesting that Jon Snow is/was the 998th Lord Commander, which sets up the expectation that someone even more special will be the 999th, 1000th, or possibly the 1001st.  That got me thinking about how GRRM likes to play with and usually subvert expectations and tropes. And that got me thinking that he also takes inspiration from actual historical events.

Here is what I predict: Jon Snow dies. A new Lord Commander is chosen.  The Lord Commander FKA Jon Snow returns. GRRM will take inspiration from what happened historically IRL from the Catholic Churchs Great Schism. There will be a schism within the NW. Half of the NW follow the 999th LC and half follow FKA Jon Snow (Lord Stone Heart?). There will be some debate, there will be sides chosen, there will be some actual infighting, etc. etc. All interesting, but all secondary to what happens when the Nights Watch does an even worse than usual job of manning the wall, including the Builders. The Builders never get enough love. What happens when they stop doing or cant do their jobs? 

As the NW tries to sort itself out, as the North tries to sort itself out, as the players try to sort out who will rule the Seven Kingdoms, The Wall will collapse. The Others and their army march south. Everyone in Westeros tries to do something, but because they all try to do it separately, they effectively do nothing.  Winterfell falls. There is no supply line to the Erie and things get desperate there when zombies learn to climb the cliffs. Bear Island is overrun when the water surrounding it freezes. The Iron Born get in their ships and decide they have some urgent fish related business in the Summer Isles. The Freys worst nightmare comes true when the river freezes and they can be ignored. Harran Hall is where King Tommen decides to make a stand. All the best knights are there. Ser Jamie, the newly knighted Ser Mance, the newly knighted Brienne of Tarth, Ser Bronn, Ser Zombie Mountain, and even Ser Pounce. 

It does not go well. Perhaps they were always destined to fail; perhaps they are betrayed by Ser Zombie Mountain who realizes he will be better off with his own kind; perhaps the curse of Harran Hall strikes again. It doesnt really matter. They lose. Those that can fall back to Kings Landing do and those that cant join the White Walkers. The Sparrows and the Septants try to pray their way out of this by arresting Melesandre. The Maesters load up on dragon fire and prepare to kick ass. Ser Davos shows up with a boat full of dragon glass he got from Dragonstone, but they think he is invading and sink his ship in Blackwater Bay. And then 

Enter Dany and the Dragons. They are here to save the day! Oh look  the Brotherhood Without Banners is here too! Except they have a banner, and its the banner of House Targaryan. Everyone realizes the error of their ways. In the way we realize today that Shakespeare wrote propaganda about Richard III because the Plantagenets were out and the Tudors were in, it becomes clear that those Targaryans werent so bad. It was the Baratheons and the Lannisters who pushed that story on us to justify usurping the throne. Except

Dany and the Dragons arent here to save the day for Kings Landing. They are there because all of their Westerossi enemies are conveniently located in one place.  All the knights and power players and secondary participants youve come to know are gone in less than one chapter. Goodbye Sansa. Goodbye Cerci. Goodbye Prince Doran. Goodbye Littlefinger. Goodbye Gilly and baby Sam. The Iron Throne is melted. Tyrion is installed as Governor on behalf of the Mereneese Empire. End of book 6.

Book 7 is much more literal the story of ice versus fire. Dany and the Dragons battle the Others. Much of this book will be told from the POV of the Others (Nights King, etc.) and their allies: Children of the Forest, warged out Hodor has his own very deep and profound chapter, Super Bran and his Direwolf army, etc. 

The war reaches a stalemate. The Others control the ground, the dragons control the sky. Dany sends a Blackfish on a quest to get more dragon eggs and/or dragons. Also shes pregnant.

The Iron Bank still wants its money. In fact if they dont get it they are in trouble. They decide their best chance is to back Dany. They hire a faceless man to assassinate someone. Its unclear who but it is hinted at that its not the Nights King and that the faceless man is uniquely qualified.  The assassin is of course Arya, and she is uniquely qualified because she can warg and use that to avoid detection. 

Menawhile the humans that cant leave Westeros have fled to Dorne. Samwell Tarly shows up and bumbles his way into a strategy meeting with Tyrion, some Grand Maester, and whoever the Dornish Prince is. Sam is sent on a mission to convince Jon Snow and the remenants of the NW (now holed up in Eastwatch) to go to Dragonstone and get lots of dragon glass to arm the Dornish army.  There are reasons they cant do this themselves: they lost a dragon, another one is in Mereen keeping the peace there, and the last is being kept in reserve to protect Dorne and/or make a last stand.

Sam shows up at Eastwatch. Jon Snow tells us in flashback what happened when The Wall fell. The NW are a lot like the Brotherhood Without Banners now, except they arent secret Targaryan supporters. This chapter concludes with Jon Snow not committing to take a side because he realizes he knows nothing.

In a later chapter it will be revealed that Aryas target is Super Bran. So she is also able to track him through warging, talk her way past Hodor, and get close enough to Bran.  She has been warned/coached to behave or do certain things in front of weirwood trees and crows to gain Brans confidence. 

Meanwhile back at Eastwatch, FKA Jon Snow is summoned to the overlook. You have to see for yourself hes told. Outside the gates looks to him like a small pack of wilding children children riding on the backs of dire wolves. And thats when Rickon says Hail, brother! Jon recogonizes Shaggy Dog and realizes who it is. Rickon is leading a commando-type squad of Children of the Forrest  who are anti-invation and armed with dragonglass spears from the Fist of the First Men. They are chopping down every wierwood tree and killing every crow. Jon is so happy to see his little brother alive. Rickon in turn excoriates Jon for not acting (GRRM draws on Hamlet here. Both in the show and in the books Jons wearing the black has had connotations of Hamlet. Now it becomes a literally a literary joke.) Rickon shares that hes on mission to rescue Bran, who he believes has been brainwashed. Hes gotten lots of good intell from his rebel CotF friends. Rickon wargs the dire wolves and other animals for military advantage. He keeps his force nimble and neat, but now he needs Jon to do something bring a message from the anti-invasion CotF to the 7 kingdoms.

Next Chapter  it turns out Ned Starks investigation was completely necessary. Governor Tyrion reads Neds papers. His investigation into the bloodlines revealed which minor lords, bastards, and common people have the same traits as Targaryans  resistant to fire/heat. Someone recognizes Gendry. He is a blacksmith of exceptional ability who can work valerian steel. It turns out that and the key to being a valerian steel blacksmith is to be resistant to fire. Surprise  Gendry is not a Baratheon bastard but a Targaryan! The few remaining Measters (I forgot to mention that we find out Oldtown has been sacked by the Others) advise burning Gendry at the stake as a test. He survives. They then track down every residual Targarian. (There is a later scene or demi chapter in which many innocent people are subjected to burning either via dragon or by other means.) 

Jon arrives in Dorne. Rickon told him the location of the Others homebase.
Gendry is legitimized and dubbed a knight. He takes the bull as his sigil. He leads a group of other Targaryan fire-resistant bastards into battle and his group have bad-ass bull helmets. Jon Snow and Gendrys Bulls develop a strategy of becoming bait for Others, then dragons scorch, Walkers and zombies die, and Jon Snow &amp; Co. move on.

Rickon and Arya meet and fight. Rickon dies. Arya kills Bran. 

Epilogue:

The wedding of Black Fish and Dany. Blackfish revealed as the father of her babies (she had twins). They also have more baby dragons.

For me personally, almost everything to do with Arya. Didn't like her in the first episode, but she didn't improve for me personally and I've despised her since season 1. Kind of biased since I already loath child characters as it is, but I find myself tolerating Bran actually. But for Arya, I'm at the point where I will be happy if she died. Every scene with her I literally wish it would just end and when I rewatch the series, I skip pretty much all her scenes unless she is with some other major character like Ned, Tywin, etc.

Just pages before he tells Cersei that he'll tell Robert about the children, he tells Pycelle that he speaks with the king's tongue while Robert is away. He has all the proof he needs (and really - a king doesn't need too much in the way of proof; he's the king...). You might say that it's because he thought Robert would be mad, but he openly defied Robert in the Khaleesi assassination plot in the name of justice, so why not this time? Surely after the anger of the perceived slight passed, Robert would be grateful for being rid of Cersei. He says multiple times how much he detests her and he only married her because he was urged to make an heir by his advisors (Jon Aryn I think?). Ned could've gotten the Lannisters out of King's Landing and protected the children (the whole reason he told Cersei) in one fell swoop. If he had just banished them to the free cities or the Summer Isles or something, they'd be safe from Robert's rage and the realm would've better for it. Was this explained later in the books? I don't think they explained it away in the show, so why couldn't Ned have done this? He's clearly not afraid of Tywin because he ordered Tyrion be captured and the mountain milled.

It seems nearly impossible that he could get that many people into his service all over Westeros AND Essos. It also is quite amazing how quickly he gets his information after the event happens, seemingly faster than any raven could fly. I also read somewhere in the first book that when two men spoke in private Varys still found out.

So my theory is that Varys doesn't have any spies at all but in fact he just has some sort of knowledge to find things out. Some sort of magic or godly power or whatever. He can tell certain people the secrets that he has found out if he feels that it will serve the realm but can also withhold the secrets if he feels that is best. As he told Eddard in his cell that he serves nobody but the realm because somebody has to. A quick example could be that he knew the truth of Joffrey/Tommen/Myrcella's birth but didn't tell anyone because he knew it would cause war.

Littlefinger locks himself in the Eyrie during winter his soldiers and house staff all banging at the castle door till they freeze to death. Several years later Littlefinger survives winter thanks to not needing to feed anyone other than himself but when he leaves the castle he  see's the bones of those who begged to enter years before.    As Littlefinger continues to descend he finds all other towers empty and continues down the mountain. He stills see's no one not even horses. Some time later he gathers the courage to leave the Vale taking with him light clothing a sword and some food as he knows he must travel quietly to avoid the Mountain Clans. Skipping forward some months Littlefinger passed many villages all empty to his shock. He then will reach Kings Landing dead as all the other lands he traveled. 

Littlefinger will make his way to the throne room and see the damaged stained glass windows sunlight poring in onto the throne and then he will see the first living creature he has seen since summer all those years ago. A small mockingbird sits at the top of the Iron Throne staring down at him.

He has been dead the whole time and is being used as a puppet, perhaps one of many used by Bloodraven. I find a lot of evidence for this throughout ASOIAF. Feel free to supplement in support of this theory.

**First, the description of Varys.** 

The man who entered the room was plump, perfumed, powdered his breath smelled of lilacs Catelyn 4 AGOT
""He smelled as foul and sweet as flowers **on a grave.**"" Eddard AGOT

He is a master of disguise and is always heavily scented and powdered. 

**Who would need to always be heavily powdered, scented and a master of disguise?** 
A dead man, to conceal all of his flaws.

**Who have we seen resurrected once dead?** 
Coldhands, who was used by Bloodraven most likely in order to escort Bran to safety. Coldhands can talk, walk and even ride an elk. The Others are not the only ones who can bring back the dead, apparently.

**How does Varys learn his little secrets?** 
Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know. He has some dark art, Ned, I swear it. Eddard 4 AGOT

""Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oft times he knows about it before it happens. He has informants anywhere, his little birds he calls them. Catelyn AGOT

Varys' little birds whisper to him from all over, just as ravens, perhaps even through weirwoods and Quaithe in Essos. Even most of his ""little birds"" are described as children. Like children of the forest, maybe.

**Who else uses birds in mass?** 
Bloodraven.

**What does Varys serve?** 
The Realm. We have heard this countless times.

""Ser Kevan. Forgive me if you can. I bear you no ill will. This was not done from malice. It was for the realm. **For the children** ... There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes ..."" Epilogue ADWD

**What does Bloodraven serve?** 
He has lived beyond his mortal span, and yet he lingers. For us, for you, for the realms of men. Bran III ADWD 

Bloodraven also serves the Realm.

**Does Varys have any sexual tendencies?** 
No.

**Who would not have the urge to merge?** 
A dead dude.


Theory in short: Varys is dead and being controlled by Bloodraven, a Targaryen, in order to bring a Targaryens back to power and potentially defeat the Others or for more sinister motives as Preston Jacobs describes in his brilliant The Minds of Wolves and Robins video series ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMgUIPvAlLI&amp;list=PLCsx_OFEYH6vAkHO0gakDrZ8Kuteu-nUn&amp;index=1 )

1) Flee back to Essos, and warn them that there's strong Northern magic around (the kind that resurrects Jon Snow). 

2) Get killed by Davos (likely)

3) Flee to Winterfell, where she throws her lot in with the Boltons. She truly does see the Others as the main enemy, and it's quite likely that she now sees the Boltons as the only ones with a chance to stop them.

Mel resurrected Jon and Davos begrudgingly helped Mel get out of Castle Black because he saw saving Jon to be more important than his hatred of her after she had a barbecue and didn't invite him. They went off south to find Sam because he knows all the shit about how to kill cold people.

Back up North, Brienne, Sansa &amp; co. help lead a rebellion against the Boltons with all the Northern Lords and Shirtless Ramsay gets impaled on Oathkeeper.

Meanwhile, Littlefinger is plotting and taking over things, Cleganebowl proves the hype to be real, and everything goes as expected.

Anyway, I'm bored and now on to the final season. Hope is being lost as the Walkers reach the neck with a huge army of fresh dead. The Tyrells, Knights of the Vale and Dornish armies all join up behind Jon because he screwed over all the Lannisters and Freys (Filch is a filthy squib). Jaime goes off to find Tyrion and Dany along with Daario, Varys etc. and with the Dothraki horde gets Tyrion to tell Dany that they need to get to Westeros ASAP.

Meanwhile No one is done training and about to go off on a big mission she was selected for and been groomed for since she was a young child.

Jon gives an absolutely incredible speech ala [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lW05E2CBJQ) and the realms of men are super hyped up. There's a shit ton of wildfire and dragonglass thanks to Sam's knowledge and it actually looks like the living have a tiny chance of hope. Obviously Wun Wun is there. But wait, what's this army coming from the South? Are they here to aid mankind? Yes! It's the entire population of Braavos! Sexy Jesus leads them, with No one at his side. Then they all stop. As one, they bring their hands to their faces. They are all Sexy Jesus.

Then shit hits the fan. Wights pop out of the ground and slaughter people but men aren't going down without a fight. They're going down nonetheless. And as they die, the undead army strengthens.

Then, just like the eagles and John Cena in a Royal Rumble, Drogon (who has been warged into by Bran to guide Dany to the battle) comes in and announces the arrival of the badasses who ride at the army of the dead. They don't really know how to deal with so many horses so end up getting fucked. The White Walkers are only 100 or so in number so can be isolated and ganged up on with dragonglass but it's not easy.

Finally, Jon and the Night's King are staring at each other. They clash swords. Longclaw is holding its own against the icy sabre of the undead leader. Jon is on the defensive, nearly losing his head to a smart swipe. The Night's King has a lot of magic within him and uses it to blind Jon in a mini blizzard which he summons. He then goes for the kill while he's down. Jon knows he's in trouble though and rolls out the way, but not quick enough. He loses a hand, and can no longer fight. He's a goner. Jon's parentage is revealed. The Night's King is his father. Just as Jon is clinging on and saying, ""No, no. That's impossible!"" Drogon/Bran stomps on the mofo and burns him to a crisp. Dany, sat atop her dragon, exchanges a smug smile with Jon.

 
 

""And that kids, is how I met your mother.""

Some believe he is, others believe that Brienne does not kill him. Theories about why she does not kill him basically stem from two areas. First, Brienne has some realization that Stannis is not as terrible as she thought (for whatever reason) or that she needs Stannis to do something. The second reason to think Stannis may be alive is the fact that Stannis looks away from Brienne a few times to suggest that something is behind Brienne. One idea of what is behind Brienne is that Sanza calls out to stop her.

I only watch the show, but I was thinking of alternate ways Stannis may be alive. I would like feedback on this possibility, and let me know if it is impossible due to anything in the books. What if there is someone behind Brienne, and they kill her with an arrow to the head/throat. Stannis would not say anything if he saw one of his men trying to save him (though he probably should not have encouraged her to kill him). There is one theory, with some support, that Stannis purposefully sent half of his men away the night before the march on Winterfell so they could attack the Bolton's at a later point. The archer could have been one of these men. Why not show Brienne dying in the episode? Well I'm sure D&amp;D want to leave cliffhangers, and the last episode already has one major death as well as a minor death, three may be overkill. However, showing Brienne die would be a great way to start off Season 6.

Just a heads up that these characters are not being introduced to interact with their progeny - they have other roles and in fact may not interact at all with their kids.  

Randyl Tarly is perhaps the most prominent bannerman of the Tyrells and as the Tyrells remained loyal to the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion he was the most prominent and successful field commander for the crown against the rebels.  Sam has little interest in seeing his father - his plotline is going just about as well as anybody's right now - unless he has reversal of fortune he has no reason to believe that his father will improve his situation.  Sam will likely not be going hom - he is going to the Citadel and his father is not headed there - but he may have reason to go to King's Landing. 

Howland Reed was Ned Stark's best friend and his companion in the rebellion - including he was there when Ned went to ""rescue"" Lyanna at the Tower of Joy.  Meera is a long way from home as far as we know and Howland Reed's keep at Greywater Watch is a natural destination for Sansa (being South of Winterfell and she no doubt remembers the loyalty of her father's best friend) or Jon (for similar reasons - if there is a Jon and we all think there will be).  

These two characters have other business and may not ever interact with their progeny - there is precedence for this.  Lord Commander Mormont was Jorah's father and they never interacted.  There will probably be mention of the relationships - but I won't be surprised if their plot lines do not intersect.",6,13,False,self,,,,,

Wights are being warged by a super-warg, like Bran.
Standard Wargs can only control simple minded-creatures, such as birds. 
Resurrected people (either by Fire or Ice) are easier to warg, as they're a little less than all there. 
A Super-Warg can control hordes of the resurrected through warging (hence the eyes). Those are wights.
Bran is a potential Mega-Super-Warg. He can already warg Hodor, and nobody can do that (according to Jojen).
Bran is being trained in the ways of Super-Wargdom, so that he too can become wight-raising practitioner of Ice magic.
The God of Fire has its disciples (Mel and Thoros) and exponents of its magic (the Targaryens)

Weiss have spoken with GRRM about the rest of the story and they know the ending. If GRRM were unable to complete the book series, it's still very possible that D&amp;D would complete the television series.

&gt;**But it's not likely the show will ""catch up"" to the books anyway.** The 5-year delays for AFFC and ADWD were caused by the unplanned expansion of the middle of the story. GRRM has had the ending outlined for many years, so it's reasonable to expect a more normal book release schedule of 1-3 years. That means with ADWD published in 2011, **the extreme scenario is that TWOW should be out by 2014** and ADOS by 2017. Seasons 3 and 4 are expected to mostly cover the events of ASOS, and D&amp;D have now stated they're trying to get it all done in 7 seasons. Some AFFC events may play out in Season 4, and the remainder of AFFC and ADWD together will likely be Season 5.

&gt;So events in TWOW would be in season 6 at the earliest and filmed in 2015 with airing in 2016. If both books take 3 years each, **TWOW will be completely published a year before production of Season 6 begins**. And ADOS' publication in 2017 would coincide with the final season. Since books are usually finished many months before actual publication, that leaves room for the book to technically be finished before scripts for the final season are written. And that all assumes the show can be done in 7 seasons, that the show is not cancelled before 7 seasons, and that GRRM takes the full 3-year timeline for both of the remaining two books.",16,6,False,self,,,,,

For example, in the show, in Season 2, Episode 7, Theon presents two tarred and mutilated bodies of children to the people of Winterfell. I remember when i had read the book that that part was one of those things you needed to put the book down for, and just process for a second, after being in such a shock of what had just happened. I was truly in convinced. The show however, did much less to hide the secret here. The bodies are actually of two orphan boys, and the show puts great emphasis on these orphan boys, where they were, how they tie in, etc. So by the end of the episode, when I'm trying to hide my smile under a blanket because I know what really happens, instead of a sad ""Oh my gosh"", I head ""Orphan Boys."" I said ""What?"" And my sister just said, ""Isn't it obvious, it's the orphan boys"".

I don't know, I just feel like there are some scenes in the show that could have been so much more emotional had they added/redacted some information leading up to it. 

**Edit:** Yes, I understand right before the event takes place in the book that Reek mentions faking it, but the point I'm trying to make is that the suspense before that information was provided was very high due to the fact that Jojen's green dreams (at that point in time) were said to be what would come true. In his dream, Jojen says he sees Reek skinning **Bran and Rickon**, not the two orphan boys, therefore, even after evidence is provided against it being Bran and Rickon, there's still the feeling of uncertainty due to conflicting information.

Robb finds him at Harrenhal, Tywin had left the Mountain there with a garrison, and when they had to flee the slaughtered everyone. Qyburn was there and he barely survived the mountains slaughter. 

I can't help but wonder why Qyburn would ""save"" the man who tried to kill him. Why would he be so loyal to the lannisters when it was Robb Stark who saved his life?

I haven't read the books, but I was wondering if there are points in the books where the Seven is represented magically? How bout legends of the Seven showing magical evidence?",26,14,False,self,,,,,

(This theory follows R+L=J)

What if Ned was reluctant to discuss the identity of Jon's mother with him because he wanted to ensure that Jon join the NW and take his vow.

And the vow would be why Ned would agree to talk about Jon's mother with him at all. Being the man of honor that he was, he knew Jon deserves to know who his mother was. But he also made a promise to his sister which is why he hasn't revealed his mother's identity thus far.

Ned essentially ensured Jon's safety from the king and those who would see him as a threat to their claim to the throne. As well as preventing him from backing out of joining the NW and going to find his aunt in the east. This would allow him to fulfill the promise he made to his sister by protecting him, and would also do the honorable thing by revealing his true parentage.

TL;DR- Ned wanted Jon to join NW for relative safety and so he could use the NW Vow as insurance so he could reveal Jon's parentage to him.

2034,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-22,2015,8,22,4,3hvzk4,self.gameofthrones,[S2/ACOK] Strategists and tacticians of the War of the five Kings,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3hvzk4/s2acok_strategists_and_tacticians_of_the_war_of/,[deleted],1440186771,"Before we start, some definitions, as Tyrion pointed out, tactics do not equal strategy

**Strategy**: the art of planning and directing overall military operations and movements in a war or battle. (Ie: where and when you fight your battles)

**Tactics**: the art of disposing armed forces in order of battle and of organizing operations, especially during contact with an enemy. (Ie: how you defeat your opponent when you engage in battle)

So with the war ended, who were the best strategists and tacticians in the war? This is a question i have been pondering since i finished ACOK and have decided to make a post on it.

The commanders:

Representing Joffrey - Tywin Lannister

Rob Stark

Balon Geryjoy

Stannis Baratheon

Renly Baratheon

For both of these lists i will be discounting Renly, as he did not engage in 1 battle, making him the worst strategist and tactician, but only by default.

Tacticians:

1)**The best**: Rob Stark

Yes, the young wolf, imo, is the best tactician during the war, mainly because he never lost a battle. This guy, while incredibly lucky at times (not getting killed during the crag, Jaime having his army split 3 ways in the siege of Riverrun, etc...) knew how to use his men and his surroundings, as shown in the battle of the battle of the whispering wood, where he brought his cavalry round the Lannister shield wall and used the woods to hide his men.

2) Stannis ""The Mannis"" Baratheon

How is this possible? How can the Mannis lose to a ""Green boy""? Simple. Even though Stannis had an excellent battle plan and managed to adapt quickly (sending his men over the burning ships as a bridge), he still lost the only battle he engaged in, making him second to the young wolf.

3) Tywin Lannister

Sorry Tywin, but nothing i have seen from your battles makes me think you are a competent as the others. Yes you won the Green Fork (with a little help from Roose via arrow bombardment), but you were defeated by Edmure Tully (AKA the floppy fish) and was constantly humiliated by Rob. 

Renly and Balon have been discounted from this list as neither have any evidence to show they were good tacticians (at least none that i can find).

Strategists:

1) **The best**: Balon Greyjoy

Now before you try to start a living autopsy on me to see if i have a mental blockage, hear me out. It may just be a mix of pure pot luck and events he has no control over, but imo, Balon is the best strategist during this war. Balon recognizes the North is open for conquest and manages to take Deepwood Motte and Moat Cailin, although shortly after the war he loses the latter shortly after the war. All in all, Balon knew exactly when and where to attack, and succeeded.

2) Tywin Lannister

While not a great tactician, he was a pretty good strategist (contrary to what Tyrion said). Keeping his army stationed at Harrenhal allowed him to maintain a presence in the Riverlands and scurry back to Kings Landing. As well as that, he avoided fighting Rob Stark in open battle and managed to take him out (again, with the help of Roose) when he least expected it and with minimum troop loss (on his part).

3) Stannis Baratheon

Look, I love Stannis, I have his sigil as my flair, but his part in the war was abysmal. His main strategic mistake was he spent WAY too much time preparing to take Kings Landing and gave Tywin a huge head start to get to KL. I understand that he had to take Storms End, but by waiting around and negotiating for so long he missed his chance to take KL and ended up losing the war badly. Similar to what i said about Tywin under tactics, nothing Stannis did in the war gives me any reason to think he was a great strategist.

4) Rob Stark

Rob is hands down the worst excuse for a strategist during the war of the five kings. He did EVERYTHING wrong, not informing Edmure (his general in the riverlands) of his plans (causing Tywin to defeat Stannis), to Marrying Jeyne/Talisa, to leaving near half his army under the command of Roose, and allowing a third of his force to be killed at Duskendale, to having essentially no solid overall plan, Im sorry, but Rob just fucking sucks at strategy.

Again, Renly has been discounted for the aforementioned reasons.

So, do you agree (im sure no one agrees with me on Balon being the best strategist) and how would you rank them?

But I can't bring myself to hate him as much as others do. Yes, he betrayed Jon giving him the final stab that kills him, but I think people are ignoring the context behind his character.

Olly had a pretty good life before the Wildlings, he lived in a village had a family that genuinely loved him, had friends, but then the Wildlings come along and kill everyone he ever loved or cared about in his life, and to rub salt in the wound the Thenns told him they'd eat his mother and father. He's forced to live in Castle Black, drafted into a war he never had any intention of joining, while people at Castle Black seem to treat him well, its certainly a huge step down from his old life. 

Now the Lord Commander suddenly wants to make peace with the Wildlings, the people whom killed everyone you loved and cared for. We know that the Nights Watch should cast away its war with the Wildlings because of the threat the Nights King presents to the realm. But Olly never's seen that, he never saw the Wight army at the end of S2, or the Massacre at Hardhome, he's never even seen a Wight, whilst most members of the Watch would atleast know about the Wight that attacked Mormont. So Jon's asking Olly to fight alongside the people whom murdered his family, for a reason that Olly can't fully comprehend because he's never seen the army of the dead firsthand.

Asking Olly to support Jon would be akin to asking Arya to fight alongside Lannister soldiers for the good of the realm, it simply makes no sense for their character to do that. If anyone should be hated its Thorne, he's been consistently attacking Jon ever since he joined the Watch and should understand that the threat of the army of the dead outweighs any grudges he has with the Wildlings. 

So that's my defense of Olly, not that I have a particular fondness for him, if a Wight stabs him I'm not going to shed a tear or light a candle, but I'm not going to cheer or rejoyce either.

Edit: For some reason I thought Alliser Thorne's name was Crowley",43,24,False,self,,,,,

I'm just wondering, how many of you think that a Westerosi wedding would be a fun idea? And how many of you think that it would be too... silly? My SO and I are both huge fans, and the whole cloaking and bedding (only our close friends attending) thing just seems like a fun alternative to the boring old church wedding (neither of us are religious).

Is this too much though? I always see people being made fun of for Star Trek or Star Wars or Fantasy-themed weddings. Though I know I really shouldn't care what a bunch of strangers think, I know I would be hurt if I found my wedding pictures on some website where people are making fun of super-fans. What do YOU all think? Is it worth the risk?

Basically, he thinks that during Oberyn's trial by combat, he put poison on his blade and when he struck The Mountain, it poisoned him and later killed him after the trial had finished. Cersei (or some high up in Kings Landing) somehow brought him back to life and now he is a mindless zombie, who will do anything the Queen Regent tells him to do. He believes that this 'zombie' is the one in the gold armour who picked Cersei up after her Walk of Shame through the city.

Thoughts? Is he making this up (I watched the trial a long time ago)? Is there something in the books similar to this?

So, I've been reading some discussions saying that, ""No, Jon is not dead because we won't gain anything or nothing ended by his death."" Apparently, when 'big' characters died, it will bring and/or end something in the plot (correct me if I'm wrong here). For example, Nedd Stark's death causes the separation of the Stark's children and Robb Stark's death ends the North's rebellion (again, I'm not an expert).

So, since Jon is clearly is one of the significantly important characters, people have been saying that we won't gain anything or nothing will end from his death. So, he can't be dead. As much as I want to hold that and hoping that Jon is not dead, I can't help thinking, what if the death of Lord Snow brings the downfall of the Wall?

We know that the Night's Watch doesn't have enough man power to protect the Wall. Not even against the Free Folks, and for sure, not enough to hold it against the Others. We have seen the size and terror of the army of the undead. The last hope for them is by joining forces with the Free Folks, suggested and ordered by our beloved hero, Jon.

With Jon dead, the First Ranger, Alliser Thorne, will become the acting commander. And we all know that jackass won't have the Free Folk there (or he won't stab Jon in the first place). Here, I'm assuming the arrangement between the NW and the FF will not work, they might be killing each other. That's when the WhiteWalkers &amp; the undead come and the living won't stand a chance. Then, winter is truly coming for all of Westeros. The title for the next book provides a little sense to this - The Winds of Winter.

So, that is, what I think, the significance of Jon's death - the downfall of the Wall, the Night's Watch and the last defense of the realm of Men. Believe me, I don't want him dead, too. I want to believe he is the reborn of Azor Ahai, but what if there is no reborn of Azor Ahai in the first place? What if Melisandre can't resurrect him? What do you guys think?",91,45,False,self,,,,,

Joffrey and Myrcella are dead, Tommen is going through puberty and losing control of his city. If Cersei looses Cleganebowl that could set her off and make it her mission to destroy Kings Landing.

One of the ways she can do this is using wildfire. King Aerys, the Mad King, threatened to burn down the city and wildfire was his way of doing it. Aerys's wildfire bomb didn't go off because Jamie stopped him. With this being said the bomb is lost in the city. Cersei knows about the wildfire and has the pyromancer produce more and more of it. If Cersei just loses it she has the power to destroy the city.

This fits well into the story line of Jamie, who is returning back to Kings Landing at the end of season 5, would be faced with the same situation as he was with the Mad King, only with the women she loves instead. This is also why Daenerys in the House of the Undying walks through the throne room that just got its shit rocked.

##2.05 - ""The Ghost of Harrenhal""

* Directed By: David Petrarca
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 29, 2012

In Harrenhal, Jaqen H'ghar, one of the three caged prisoners Arya Stark saved from death during her trip to the Wall pledges to kill three people of her choosing in order to repay his debt to her. She accepts and chooses the Tickler as the first, the man who tortures to death the captives that were brought there with her. After Renly's sudden death at the hands of Melisandre's shadowy assassin, Catelyn and Brienne are forced to flee from Renly's camp. Theon sails from Pyke prepared to prove that he is a true Ironborn, with plans to overtake Winterfell while Robb is out fighting the war. The Night's Watch arrive at an ancient fortress called the Fist of the First Men, where they intend to make a stand.

---

##2.06 - ""The Old Gods and the New""

* Directed By: David Nutter
* Written By: Vanessa Taylor
* Originally Aired: May 6, 2012

Princess Myrcella is sent away from King's Landing. Theon Greyjoy's plans to take Winterfell succeed as he continues to try to prove his Ironborn status. Robb reunites with the healer Talisa. At the Fist of the First Men, the ranger Qhorin Halfhand gives Jon Snow the opportunity to prove his worth. While out on patrol, Jon takes prisoner a Wildling named Ygritte. Joffrey incites a riot at King's Landing, in which he is nearly killed and Sansa is nearly raped. At Qarth, Daenerys tries to procure a ship to take her people to Westeros. Taken in by Tywin Lannister, Arya attempts to hide that she is Ned Stark's daughter, as Jaqen H'ghar helps her conceal her identity. Robb receives news of Theon's plans and sends men to retake Winterfell, while inside the city there are plans to get Bran and Rickon out. Daenerys' dragons are stolen.

Party was going on people are having fun when i suddenly see Allison Thorne and the folks from the table in the nights watch. (not sure what to call them, the people who sit next to the Lord commander behind the table in the dining room) When suddenly a shit loads of nights watchman attach kings landing and there were like 1000 of them. I remember my dream perspective was that i was watching it on TV. So, Sansa sees Jon Snow next to a wall and I remember saying to my mother (cause she was watching it with me, in the dream, yeah its weird) ""See this is what they are trying to do, we know Jon is dead so he cant be here, that's just stupid"". Last thing i remember is the nights watch just rolling over everyone.

Thought its not that bad of a idea to share it. No new GoT episodes and people upload art work (Cant do that cant draw, something between my arm and my brain just makes it so i cant draw) and I just saw an interesting dream.

When I first watched I got the impression that they were unable to pass over/through water but after some thinking I now think that if they were serious about getting to the wildlings then the white walkers could have frozen the water. The white walkers seem to have at least some basic control over the weather (blizzards occurring when they appear, temperature dropping) so it doesn't seem completely implausible that they could have frozen the water.

If Tywin is captured, would that just end the war right there an now? Would they be able to trade Tywin for Ned/Arya/Sansa before they kill Ned? Would the starks get kicked out of the north? The freys would never take over.

Throughout the series we are lead to believe that Dany is an endgame character. The show portrays her in a way to seem like prophesied savior of the world. She fits all seven signs of AA in the first season extremely well. Call me a hipster but the most obvious candidate is not always the right one. The fact that Dany fits all the signs extremely well makes me believe Dany is not Azor Ahai. Because of this I find Jon as a more likely candidate.

Does anyone feel the same way or believe Dany is one of the three heads of the dragon that make up AA?

Tldr: Dany is too mainstream to be Azor Ahai

I say this because my theory is based purely on the show, as I know there is a lot more going on with Gendry and the other Baratheon bastards in the books.

This is a theory in regards to the fate of King's Landing for next season. Right now Cersei is set to be on trial for her incestuous behavior and conspiring to murder the king. The common folk of KL, with the help of the Sparrows, is growing more and more opposed to the royal family. This is especially problematic if current King Tommy is proven to not be Robert's son and thus not a legitimate heir.

I think it could be possible that Gendry, after being set free by Davos, eventually made his way back to KL and to where he grew up. It can then be determined by a variety of factors (appearance, previous visits by important people, rumours and his own stories) that Gendry is in fact Robert's only remaining blood heir (with Stannis (probably) and Renly dead). Him being this common born but noble blooded young guy, with all the hatred for the rich going around, he is rallied around by the people as the Pauper King. The High Sparrow pounces on this and uses him to take over the city and the realm.

When Brienne finds Stannis, she sentences him to die. I guess it is pretty convincing that she is going to kill him, but what if she needs him? Maybe Brienne spares Stannis for one reason. To eliminate the Boltons from Winterfell. How would they do this? Well when Brienne goes back to watching for the candle, she will see it is lit. On her way to try to help Sansa, something will happen where she finds Sansa and Theon. As a group they leave Winterfell and head somewhere safe. As we have seen in the show, people are still loyal to the Starks, such as the Lords of Bear Island. So with Sansa, she will rally the North on her side, with the help of Stannis' military expertise they will march an army of northern men onto Winterfell and dethrone the Boltons from the Warden of the North. With this, Sansa will rule Winterfell, and Brienne will be her guard of some sort, along with Podrick. It is kinda tinfoily so let me know what you guys think.

When Ned leaves the castle with Littlefinger, and Dontos and Sansa, neither go the route taken by Varys, so it seems likely to have been an intentional detour no? Varys has shown a desire to cause as much chaos as possible in order to weaken the realm for the eventual return of the Targs, and what bigger obstacle could there have been than Tywin?

A brief history of character deaths in G-o-T - I'm counting things that seemed to be deaths emotionally on the screen - even if later they turn out to be alive somehow (and I've probably missed some and many will disagree on my groupings)
Season 1: 1 Major Death (Ned),   2 Significant deaths (Robert, Khal Drogo),  2 deaths of note (Viserys &amp; Lady)                           
Season 2: No Major Deaths   1 Significant Death (Renley),   3 deaths of note (Rodrick, Maester Luwin, Yoren)   (was that season actually Game of Thrones?)                            
Season 3: 2 Major Deaths (Robb, Catelyn),   2 Significant Deaths (Talisa, Mormont),   2 deaths of note (Ros &amp; Grey Wind)                             
Season 4: 4 Major deaths (Tywin, Ygritte, Joffrey, Sandor),  3 significant deaths (Shae, Oberyn, Jojen),   4 deaths of note (Lyssa Arryn, Locke, Craster, Karl Tanner)  Season 4 was actually messier than that - Men of the Night's Watch &amp; Wildlings, etc.. , but that's close enough                                             
Season 5: 3 Major Deaths (Jon Snow, Stannis, Barristan),  2 significant deaths (Aemon, Shireen),  6 deaths of note (Meryn Trant, Myrcella, Myranda, Selyse, Janos, Hizdahr)
      
So on the average - we get 2 major deaths, 2 significant deaths, and 3 deaths of note per season, but the death toll has been climbing - the last two seasons average 3+ major deaths, 3 significant deaths, and 5 or more deaths of note. 
       
So that means we are going to lose two or three (or more) characters that we have a lot more than a season invested in this year and two or three more that we are fairly invested in and up to a handful more.  Only three characters are dead in the books (that I know of) that are still alive in the show:[Book Spoilers](#b ""King Balon Greyjoy, Maester Pycelle, and Kevan Lannister"")
      
I think, as we are going eight seasons now - for my list - I'm going to protect the following characters: Jon (I think he will be resurrected), Tyrion, Daenerys, Sansa, Arya, Sam, Baelish, &amp; Bran                          
For our major deaths this leaves: Cersei, Jorah, Jaime, Theon/Reek, Sandor(the second time), Bronn, Davos, Margaery, Brienne, Melisandre, Pod, Grey Worm, Missandei, Gilly, Varys                           
For significant deaths: Tommen, Loras, Roose, Daario, Alliser, Olly, Lancel, the High Sparrow, Qyburn, Oleanna Tyrell, Ellaria Sand, Robert Strong (the second time), Yara                      
For deaths of note:  Walder Frey, Blackfish, Olyvar, Mace Tyrell, Areo Otah, various Sand Snakes, Doran Martell, Trystane Martell, Kevan Lannister, Balon                            
of course there will be new characters (a new red priestess, perhaps Euron/Vicatarion, perhaps Howland Reed or Randyl Tarly)  Only Victarion strikes me among these as good candidates to take the fall, maybe Reed.   And some of the less significant characters may become more significant..
      
My predictions: 
Major Deaths(4): Melisandre, Jorah, Cersei, &amp; Jaime                                              
Signficant Deaths(4): Tommen, Loras, Roose, Alliser                                        
Deaths of note: (5 or 6) Walder Frey, Kevan Lannister, Lancel Lannister, Doran &amp; Otah -or- Ellaria &amp; Sand Snakes                
        
Your thoughts? 

(Edited because somehow I missed the great Barristan Selmy - and in the ""potentials"" ranking I had the fabulous Varys under-ranked. Thanks posters. Also edited because a poster identified the three deaths in the books which have not been replicated in the show.  Edited to add Maester Luwin and Yoren to season two - which was still by far the tamest season.)",54,37,False,self,,,,,

My theory, after reading the book, has always been that Melissandre would either heal him (best case)[like Moqorro healed Victarion] or bring him back from the dead (meh case)[Like Thorros did to Beric].  When I saw this episode of the show, and noticed Mel coming back to Castle Black in the same episode that Jon got shanked, I decided that she absolutely MUST have something to do with his inevitable revival. (I say inevitable because, unlike most other deaths in the books/show, this one just wouldn't make sense for the overall flow of the story.)

What do y'all think? 

Edit:  Also, if Jon is healed/revived by Mel, that kind of makes him ""Ice and Fire"" in that he is a son of the north (Ice) but is imbued with life from the power of the red god (fire).  ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

**This post was made by [/u/xyseth](https://www.reddit.com/user/xyseth) five months ago, and I am in no way taking credit for the post or this idea.** 

**[Link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/30mat2/spoilers_all_ddt_a_neverbeforeseen_theory/)**

&gt; There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child

GRRM - on the unconscious mind and the repression of emotions that conflict with the superego

***D+D=T and R=T - a never-before-seen parentage theory***

Before we begin, take a few moments to ponder what D+D=T could be. If nothing makes sense, don't worry. It'll make 137% perfect sense in a moment.

**It all starts somewhere**

Here's Martin's big tell: King's Landing has 7 gates. You might think that 7 relates to 7 gods. Or the 7 kingdoms. But what if ""the Seven"" was invented just to play with us? To mask the elaborate interrelation between ASOIAF and one of the most famous works from the ancient Greek world?

**Thebes**

Here's a fun fact: the ancients referred to Greek Thebes as ""7-gated Thebes."" In other words, King's Landing = Thebes. From this humble starting point, we'll eventually arrive at D+D=T, so coat yourself in tinfoil and let's dive down the deepest, darkest rabbit hole.

What's so special about Thebes? Thebes is most famous for being home to Oedipus. The legendary Oedipus killed his father and married his mother. Incest, if you haven't noticed, is a major theme. King's Landing is to incest what Las Vegas is to gambling. But do we have our Oedipus?

**Oedipus Rex**

There's one clear candidate. His father disowned him from birth (like Oedipus). He's nearly universally hated (like Oedipus). And he kills his father (like Oedipus). Yes, that's right. Tyrion, our favorite dwarf, is destined to shag his mother.

But before we address how that doesn't make any sense, let's quickly flesh out a few similarities between Tyrion and Oedipus.

Tyrion has an abnormal gait, waddling to and fro 

Oedipus - literally meaning ""swollen foot"" - had his feet bound, which would likely create an abnormal gait

Tyrion saves King's Landing but that doesn't save him from being hated	

Oedipus saves Thebes but that doesn't save him from being hated

Tyrion is disowned by his father Tywin, who contemplates infanticide	

Oedipus is disowned by his father Laius, who attempts infanticide

Tyrion kills his father Tywin	

Oedipus kills his father Laius

In broad strokes, Tyrion matches Oedipus - but what about on the most important details?

**Joanna Lannister**

But isn't Joanna dead? Yes, that does appear to be a kink in the theory. But let's not get bogged down by reality technicalities yet. I plan to resolve the problem of her death unconventionally: Joanna is not Tyrion's real mother.

A womb and birth canal does not make a biological mother. If I take my eggs, get my husband to sperm one up, and implant it in your womb, are you the real mother? No. What we've got with Tyrion is an early example of surrogate pregnancy.

But then who is Tyrion's real mother? Dany. Father? Drogo. D+D=T. You heard it here first, folks. Before we see the ironclad support for such a theory, let's note the remarkable similarities between Dany's child and Tyrion.

**Rhaego vs. Tyrion**

Dany gives birth to a child that Mirri Maz Duur claims is hideously deformed, half(hu)man and fiendish.

&gt;""Monstrous,"" Mirri Maz Duur finished for him... ""Twisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with a stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat.""

Tyrion can easily be associated with each and every one of Rhaego's characteristics. This association reveals their elaborate interrelation. Tyion, like Rhaego, has been called:

***Monstrous and Twisted***

&gt;""the twisted little monkey demon""

+

&gt;""a twisted little monster""

+

&gt;""Your head was monstrous huge, we heard, half again the size of your body, and you had been born with thick black hair and a beard besides, an evil eye, and lion's claws. Your teeth were so long you could not close your mouth, and between your legs were a girl's privates as well as a boy's""

***Tailed***

&gt;""you were said to have one, a stiff curly tail like a swine's""

***Scaly and Winged***

As the child of Dany+Drogo, he's obviously associated with scaly, winged dragons. But even if we momentarily lose all sanity and entertain someone else as the father, like [Aerys](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/Who_is_Tyrions_father), then that still associates Tyrion with scales and wings. Two additional associations: (1) as Master of Coin, Tyrion had the King's Scales (under his jurisdiction), and (2) Tyrion's Lannister lion is connected to a scaly lizard through Martin inventing a special fantasy creature the [lizard-lion](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lizard-lion). So far, zero tinfoil.

**Surrogate pregnancy**

The big question is how we can conclude that surrogacy was involved, considering the tiny problem that Joanna and Dany were never alive at the same time. Thankfully, Mirri Maz Duur has got it covered.

Mirri talks about a reversal, and cycling, of time:

&gt;""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east... Then he will return, and not before.""

In other words, before Dany's husband returns, a reversal in time - symbolized by the sun moving in its opposite direction - has to complete. Quaithe, too, has more to say about time travel:

&gt;""To go north, you must go south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back""

You must go back... in time. Something from the past needs to come to the future, and something from the future must make its way to the past. That something is Dany's unborn fetus, Rhaego, who Mirri transplants back in time into Joanna's already-occupied womb by using Drogo's soul (Rhaego thus kills/absorbs his biological father). Back in the past, Joanna's genuine fetus (by Tywin/Aerys) isn't delivered and remains dead for years until Mirri blood magics the baby back into the present. Dany delivers the decaying time-capsule.

&gt;""When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years.""
Mirri confirms that Joanna's fetus, delivered by Dany, had been dead for years.

**Recap**

Using Drogo's soul, Mirri transports Rhaego-the-fetus back in time where he's delivered by an already-pregnant Joanna. Joanna's fetus (fathered by Tywin/Aerys) doesn't make it. Collateral blood magic causes this fetus to resemble Rhaego, and it begins to decay. After ""being dead for years"" Mirri sends it back to the future, and delivers it from Dany's womb. Back in the past, Rhaego gets named Tyrion (R=T). Tyrion lives as a Lannister for over 34 years. Even though he has already killed/absorbed his biological father Drogo, Tyrion kills his adoptive father Tywin for shits. Tyrion returns to Dany to complete Mirri's prophecy: ""then [her husband] will return, and not before."" Tyrion marries Dany, his mother. Oedipus gets Rex'd. The world shutters as Tyrion begins to mount it.

&gt;A very small man can cast a very large shadow

**Predictions**

1. Tyrion kills Hizdahr zo Loraq (because why not at this point?)

2. Dany and Tyrion marry. Their marriage is first consummated in King's Landing (Thebes)

3. King's Landing will be leveled to the ground, much like Thebes

4. Tyrion will fly a dragon because he's the Stallion who Mounts the World

5. Tyrion becomes King of Westeros

6. Tyrion will gouge out his eyes (like Oedipus, also fulfilling Mirri's description of Rhaego as blind)

*Technical note: the father of Joanna's fetus doesn't matter in the end, since its purpose is to die for years. The father could be moonboy for all I know.*

Format: [C or C](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiafcirclejerk/comments/2xc21e/i_noticed_little_something_something_about_a/)

**TLDR:** The halfman is the Stallion who Mounts the World. Mirri Maz Duur created a rift in spacetime to do a fetus-swap, making Rhaego and Tyrion the same person, and creating a prophecy where he becomes destined to marry Dany, his mother.

**P.S. - I'm not as good at formatting, so the other post is linked at the top, and the reason I'm sharing this post here is because I know that not every member is active in both /r/gameofthrones and /r/asoiaf, so I thought it'd be nice to receive input on the theory from this community here.**",18,9,False,self,,,,,

So the Greatest Jon's speech goes ""MY LORDS! Here is what I say to these two kings! Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, Ive had a bellyful of them. Why shouldnt we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead! There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, mlords. The King in the North!""

Shortly, Karstark follows and says ""They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well.""


So I guess it's kind of irrelevant now (inb4 DAKINGOFDANORF) but like what does that mean exactly? Are they just going to ignore the South and do what they want? Are they going to rule over all seven kingdoms from the north? Is someone going to be in king's landing or is the new king's landing going to be in the north and that's where the council convenes? Just kind of curious of the logistics of it.

What if Varys was a Reyne (of Castamere)? 

It may not be as crazy as it sounds:

- Varys was an orphan, and despite him suggesting he was born in Lys, he has completely lost his accent. If his parents were Reynes, he could have been bundled away to Essos
- the dates line up - the Reynes were destroyed in 261 AC, and Varys turns up around 280 AC.
- the magician who castrates Varys could have been attempting to end Varys' line under the orders of Tywin
- despite being a eunuch, Varys is completely bald. Typically eunuchs regrow their hair after castration (or never lose it if it is done before puberty as with Varys). Perhaps this was done to hide a distinguishing feature of the Reynes (nothing seems to be mentioned in the wiki, but perhaps blonde hair like the Lannisters?)
- it would explain his destruction of the Lannisters (both Tywin through Tyrion and Kevan), and why he supported Dany despite having Aegon in his back pocket presumably the whole time.

I have some fresh thoughts after a rewatch and this particular trend is starting to annoy me. The downfall of various armies throughout the show is, in my opinion, often cheapened by series of unfortunate (yet ever more predictable) events.

*Renly's 100,000: Clearly he has the numbers and the advantage to destroy Stannis. What happens? Shadow Baby. No war. Just surrender and fleeing to Stannis (understandably, in the eyes of the bannermen).

*Stannis's ~50,000? (This was never mentioned. It would essentially be Renly's 100,000 - the Tyrells. Provide me with some insight if you have a more accurate estimate. The size isn't even the major point of this discussion.): Decimated by wildlife. I'll actually let this one slip as one of the more mild examples, as the battle of Blackwater Bay was at least depicted for a large portion of an episode. I didn't feel cheated too much on this one.

Mance Rayder's 100,000: Crushed by Stannis in the matter of a minute, despite him having only a few thousand men.

Stannis at Winterfell ~A few thousand men: (This example is a much smaller number, but still relevant) He was favored to win against the Boltons at Winterfell while we neared the end of Season 5, even Littlefinger said so himself. Again, a series of unfortunate events arrives. Oh look, your food supplies were not only found by Ramsay and his twenty with pure luck, but also half of your army deserted you in the night on horseback and you didn't notice. Why? Because they were out of food? Winterfell had reserves for them and they maybe could have taken it with their beginning numbers. I know some of you will reference Ned's speech about a few hundred good men holding Winterfell against thousands, but Ramsay only has twenty good men, and Stannis is arguably the best battle commander in Westeros.

We seem to be lacking glorious battle scenes. They are being replaced with misfortunes that have made numbers in this show mean absolutely nothing. It is safe to assume every army that is formed beyond this point is likely to come down with a bad case of being cut in half or killed entirely by something not so unexpected (except the Walkers of course!).

The only demise of an army I have come to terms with is the Starks. They were my favorite house when I began (as I'm sure they were for you), but my rewatch has made it very clear that Robb's decision-making was their ultimate downfall, not a cheapened series of events. He broke his oath with Walder Frey, he ignored the advice of his advisors in chopping off Lord Karstark's head and also ignored the advice of Roose Bolton. It isn't a surprise that he did, as the Starks are much more honorable than the Boltons, however, it played a role in the outcome of the war as well.

What are your thoughts on this? Do we need to see more battles? Do numbers really mean anything in Game of Thrones? It seems plot armor prevails over statistics in almost every case.",66,90,False,self,,,,,

I apologize for formatting/grammar as I am on mobile.

First I want to tell you all this is my favorite sub by far.

My love affair with Game of Thrones began about a year ago when I decided to finally sit down and watch the show with my SO. I love watching TV shows (one of my all time faves being LOST) and I figured it would be something I would also enjoy.

Boy, was I wrong. I've since then re watched the series, read the books and I still can't get enough. I'm addicted. I think about GoT everyday. I fill my down time with reading theories, and talking about them to co-workers, friends and family. I seriously spend most of my time on reddit in this sub soaking up everything related to the show.

Does anyone else feel this way? Am I getting overly attached? 

Btw, I'm totally dead serious about this question. I can tell my friends and family think it's a little over the top but I get so much enjoyment from it. I love the mystery, the commentary it provides on society and the unexpectedness. ",15,0,False,self,,,,,

In S5E4, Jaime and Bronn are talking about how they want to die. Bronn asks Jaime how he wants to die, to which Jaime responds ""In the arms of the woman I love."" This reminded me of the books, where Maggy the Frog prophecizes that Cersei will be killed by the ""Valonqar"" (Little Brother). Now as we know from the books, Jaime is technically Cersei's little brother, as he was born moments after her clutching her heel.

It's been guessed before that Jaime will likely kill Cersei by strangling her, as this fulfills the prophecy and we can see in both the show and the books that they are drifting farther apart and are beginning to heavily resent one another. Based on Jaime's line in the show, Cersei's willfulness/resourcefulness, and the poetry of them entertaining the world and leaving it together, my guess is that Cersei will manage to kill Jaime as he strangles the life out of her.

Does this feel plausible to you guys? It would be a weird way to wrap up Jaime's storyline, but it smells like vintage GRRM to me.

Edit: You know, right after posting this and thinking about it, I think I might have it wrong. If Brienne finally does go on a Jaime-hunt like she presumably does in the books after her run-in with Lady Stoneheart, it makes a lot more sense that *she* is the ""woman I love"" that is being foreshadowed in the show. Now *that* would be a much more delicious ending for Jaime.",23,14,False,self,,,,,

* S5 Ep1. (Adult) Cersei's first scene in S5 she is shown walking up the Steps of Baelor to Tywin's funeral - the same/similar shot to her 'walk of shame' at the end of the season. Ep1 is the death of her father's authority, the final the death of her own authority.

* S5 Ep2. After trying to get into the House of Black and White, there is a shot of Arya walking away from the entrance to the dock (to toss the Faceless Men coin she was given). She walks directly away (perpendicular) from the doors so that the centerline of her body aligns with the middle of the two doors behind her - one door is black, the other white.

Has anyone noticed any other noteworthy shots/scene set-up in S5 - or perhaps throughout the show - that fellow Redditors should keep an eye out for?

this is my very first post on reddit , so please be merciful. I'm not quite familiar with reddit and this subreddit. If i should break rules, i apologise. Now, according to the ""R+L=J""-theory, Jon is half Stark and half Targaryen. Targaryens are ""fire/heat-resistent"", which is demonstrated when Daenerys steps into the Drogo's cremation fire or when she holds hot dragon eggs. However Jon suffers burns when saving Mormont from a revenant. Shouldn't Jon be fire-resitent too? Here are my thoughts: He is only half Stark and yet has a direwolf, following the blood-line logic he should be fire-resistent aswell, right? Or is this the reason Targaryens brothers and sisters married and mated each other because otherwise they would lose their fire-resistency and potentially the ability to control dragons? What do you think?
If this has been discussed before im sorry.",28,2,False,self,,,,,

No independent democratic communities living in mountainous lands capable of fielding bad-ass armies of pikemen that can crush all opposition.  But most importantly, there isn't the slightest shred of democracy (aside from the Nightwatch elections) in all of Westeros.  Why?

2) Jon realizes his father is actually his evil nemesis. The very man he's been trying to defeat or destroy.

ANYWAYS

I feel like Bran is gonna be the person who just stops anything and everything. I just recently started reading the books right after I finished the show, so I am somewhat caught up as far as highlights go. With that said I think that Bran is the key to all this nonsense. As far as magic or the supernatural powers go, Bran picked it up like it was nothing. Sure we have the Lords of light and Melisandre boasting their magic and what not, but Bran has it down. Melisandre cant even get a prophecy right. Bran will have full knowledge of the history of the realms due to the fact that he will be able to tap into the Weirwoods and everything they have seen. With that said, and maybe a nod to the conversations Tyrion and Bran once had, it all comes down to the old saying ""Knowledge is power"" or ""Strength is in the mind."" Its will be pretty obvious he wont be able to do it on his own, but of course he will have the power to assemble the powers of good. 

All in all, I think Bran is the Professor X of Game of Thrones, and he is going to assemble his own team of X-men AKA The Starks (Arya, Jon (if alive), Sansa, Rickon) along with Ghost, Summer, Shaggy dog, Nymeria and her supposedly ever growing army of wolves.

For this last Finale, we actually had to turn people away it's gotten so out of hand. Along with the themed food, we serve only ale and red wine. We have door prizes, Jeopardy with prizes, and post finale Q&amp;A's with the Maester. Last, we play Westeros Who Am I? (Think the card game in Inglorious Bastards.)

&amp;nbsp;

Decor wise, we have thrones (chairs from an old church), candles everywhere, goblets, jugs and swords, GoT drink coasters, silver platters, and of course our House Stark banner.

&amp;nbsp;

The menus have included: Cersei's Venison Stew, The Hound's Chickens, Arya's Rabbit Stew, Roast Baratheon Stag, Wilding Vegetables, Hot Pie's Fresh baked bread, and of course Sansa's Lemoncakes. When you first enter, we also have Walder Frey's Bread and Salt.

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully everyone enjoys, and if you have any ideas, send them my way! Not too soon to plan for Season Six!

I wrote it down in a blur of entertainment, then left it to sit about and gather dust. This was before the S5 teaser even dropped, and I hadn't had the time to read the books, so this is full of ignorant optimism and plot holes. Thought I'd post it for shits and giggles. I should warn you now - it's a bit long and rambly.

*1. Arya, Grand Lady Assassin, and Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons.*

Arya trains as a master assassin with the Faceless Men, getting quite chummy with the guy in charge (who knew her dancing instructor, Syrio Forel). Eventually, Daenerys shows up at Braavos and retakes it from the slavemasters. With her Unsullied largely preoccupied by fighting some other dudes elsewhere, she seeks allegiance from the Faceless Men as a peacekeeping taskforce. They agree, but on the condition that they all get at least one hit from their lists (they all reveal that they have lists and Aryas like holy shit I thought I was the only one with a list.)
So Daenerys, Greyworm and his posse of Unsullied, and the Faceless Men team up and have kick-ass escapades around Braavos (during which THE DRAGONS TOTALLY BLOW UP THE GODAMN IRON BANK LIKE BADASSES), and Denerys gets quite friendly with Arya (she admires her bad-ass attitude).
After all that kicking ass and getting the Summer Isles under control, Daenerys finally decides she has enough of an army (Unsullied, Freed Slaves, the Faceless Men, etc) to begin her march to Westeros. And she promises Arya a hit on Cersi (aww yiss).

*2. Jon Snow, the One True King of the North.*

Whilst this is going on, Jon and Stannis go around recruiting Wildlings to their cause, all of whom are running south to escape the White Walkers. Soon they have command of Mance Rayders army, so thats cool. During this time, Melisandre the Red Lady shows increasing interest in Jon, eventually beginning a seedy love affair (which he agrees to because she looks so much like Ygritte). But shit goes wrong when the White Walkers easily overtake the army and break through the wall. Such begins a game of Cat and Mouse, with Stannis Wildling Army VS the White Walkers. As they follow Winter southwards (they leave The Onion Knight in charge of the wall, and make him a Lord of the Wall, which makes him happy), the Iron Isles get completely overrun when the king submits, seeing this as a way of becoming immortal (what is dead may never dieliterally). So now they have to deal with the Iron Isle White Walkers as well as the millions that already marched over the wall. Allying with the Brotherhood Without Banners (thanks to Stannis bullshiting about the Lord of Light), they make their way west to The Vale, but find the Lannisters (whaaat?!).

*3. The Lannisters are a bunch of scardycats.*

The Lannisters (Cersi, Tommen, Margery Tyrell, etc.) have fled Kings Landing because of an uprising of The Sparrows, who now rule it like the Nights Watch deserters did that small town (badly). They got in because Littlefinger is allied with Cersi to save his own hide. They all have conflicts with each other, but Tommen (because hes a cool guy and all) barters a deal  if they survive this, Stannis gets Westeros. Later, Stannis discovers the affair between Jon and Melisandre, goes mental, attacks Jon, they get in a fight. Jon is about to die, but then Melisandre STRAIGHT UP KILLS STANNIS WITH SPOOKY GHOST POWERS.
With Stannis dead, the agreement is redone  if the Wildling/BWB/Nights Watch help the Lannisters retake Westeros, Jon will be declared King of the North, (completely separate from the Seven Kingdoms, from Winterfell to the Wall) the Brotherhood get and independent state, and the Wildlings are allowed to live behind the safety of the wall.
And whilst all this guff is going on, the Boltons see and opportunity and just start killing everyone else who isnt them, Whitewalker or no (an opportunity to take Westeros). Brianne gets captured and is kept in the same enclosure as Reek, who develops a liking for her (like Jamie did). But Roose ends up killing her, which snaps Reek out of it and he kills the Boltons (they gave him a sword to join in Ramseys mental killing spree), which leads to much fan applause.

*4. The Monumental Clusterfuck Battle Royale for Westeros (aka SHIT GOES DOWN YO).*

At once, all of the groups converge on Kings Landing for one final battle  The White Walkers, the massive Wildling/BWB/Knights Watch/Lannister Army, the Sparrows, Daenerys, the Unsullied, the Faceless Men, the Dragons and the Boltons, all in one royal grand slam (WELCOME TO THE JAM).
Initially Team Daenerys and Team Jon fight, but end up allying when Greyworm and the Unsullied are converted to White Walkers. Dragons, explosions, zombies, main characters die, various explosions ensue. BUT THEN 
Bran shows up, flying with magical wizard power. He, with Arya and Jon holding off the waves of White Walkers (oh yeah, Arya and Jon found each other, which helped barter the whole Daenerys team up), casts this massive CGI-laden spell that kills off all the White Walkers AT ONCE, sacrificing himself in the process (its my destiny and all that). BUT WAIT 
JON STARTS TO TURN INTO A WHITEWALKER! ARYA MERCY KILLS HIM! ICE COLD (PUN INTENDED).

*5. So anyways*

In the end, Arya Stark is proclaimed Queen of the North, with a massive Direwolf army at her command (who are breed to identify any future Whitewalker uprising), along with her Royal Branch of the Faceless Men (like the Kingsguard but cooler). She is more of a badass than she was before (and thats saying something).
Daenerys is in charge of Kings Landing and a lot of Westeros, with Tyrion as her hand (he surrendered to her and managed to worm his way up the ranks using his cunning wit). All the dragons got whipped out in the big battle, though. But she is still the breaker of chains. Democracy is born.

In all honesty its my night off, I got beer and I just want to talk about Game of Thrones.

ANYWAYS

So it seems like many of us are really really relying on Melisandre to bring back Jon Snow. This would make the most sense for obvious reasons being that Melisandre, The Lord of Light, Beric Dondarrion, blah blah blah, can bring back the dead. Now I am pretty sure this theory has the most sense to it. 

The reason why I feel like this is the ONLY option is that how the hell are you gonna preserve Jons Body? Say he wargs into Ghost. How will he be preserved considering The Watch wants nothing to do with him. Im 100% positive The Watch would burn him. The Whitewalkers existence is no secret to The Watch. The Old Bear was attacked himself and by now Im sure The Watch knows and acknowledges their existence. Its also no big secret that Targaryens can be burned, so its not like his body can reject the flames. Now with that said if Jon is coming back, he would have to do so immediately, cause that body doesnt have long until its starts getting all gross and what not. Now maybe the Nights Watch are really that stupid and just throw his body off the wall, and white walkers get him. I guess that could be a thing. 

All in all if Jon is coming back its not gonna be able to extend to the end of the show, and its gonna have to happen real quick. Time is not on Jon Snow's corpse side. The only ""logical"" outcome is Melisandre resurrecting Jon immediately.

Or maybe, just maybe......

&gt;... Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.

&amp;nbsp;


Now I take this to mean good ol' Jon as the prophesied Azor Ahai, evident by the classic red sword, i.e. flaming sword. Blah blah we all know lots about Jon being Azor Ahai so I won't go into more evidence of this (but this being Jon is based off blue eyes and king I suppose, so it could be someone else...Discuss below :P). My trouble is with the last bit ""who cast no shadow"". I take this to mean, yes Jon is coming back but his lack of shadow implies a) he's no longer Jon, but a completely new person (like many have speculated) b) he's coming back as a white walker, as he is no longer alive to cast a shadow or c) I'm being too literal and it's some other crazy thing. That being said, I'm not really keen for a) and b)...

""Jaqen"" drinks the poison and collapses to the floor, dead. But the Waif, who was standing behind Arya, appears wearing Jaqen's face. So I guess this is a three pointed question.

1. Is the Jaqen that Arya meets the same as the one in Harrenhal?
2. Who was the man that died after drinking the poison?
3. Is the Waif a Faceless Man as well?

These conditions are ridiculous and even life inside Winterfell seems inhospitable. 

So, my question is, does this mean that the land between the wall and the Lands of Always Winter are currently going through their summer?

What I mean by this, is where the wildlings live actually going through summer (even though they have Snow and extremely low negative temperatures), and that the Winter will make that land much worse?

Not talking about the main cast members (e.g not Jon Snow, Joffrey, Ed Stark etc). Characters that were only in it for a few episodes ideally.


My vote goes to **Karl Tanner** (played by the brilliant Burn Gorman). He was probably the most pure evil character on the show, even more than Joffrey. Would have loved to have seen his character developed a bit more and taken on a bit more of longer role across the whole season as an antagonist.

I had a huge fan boy thing going for the starks all the way from season 1 - season 3, they were my absolute favorites and nothing would change them. When Robb first called the North to war I got excited, in my head GRRM surely wouldn't let at the time the most popular family lose a father, and his son within 2 seasons (oh man was I wrong). It was nice too, from the time Robb captured Jaime from when he gave Jaime that awesome speech while Jaime was locked up, I had the beliefs that Robb and the north would make it all the way down to Kings landing and I would see Joffrey's head on a spike right where they left Ned's prior to his death. 
Slowly, episode by episode I watched Robb make some poor tactical choices and it slowly ripped me apart, it was terrible but after it there seemed to be a little bit of faith left for him and his men! Then the worst day in all of Westeros came to happy; the Red Wedding. I will be honest with you, nothing has ever been spoiled for me in the show (Thank you to everyone), but half of me wishes the red wedding would have been spoiled. I went into a half depression, I felt like I lose a best friend; the show felt pointless and I wanted to just watch everyone burn. I actually felt lost and after it all. 
Anyways, That is mine, Robb Starks death sucked for me. Especially being a Stark lover and at the time a Joffrey + Lannister hater.

And how these events will shape the climax of the story:

Winter has been announced from the very start of the show, we are at season 5, so winter should be here by season 6 and 7. (or both keep in mind that the globe of GoT is huge and winter might take time to reach the South) I suspect winter is where the conclusion-determining measures takes place. Honestly, everything is in a messed up state. 

- Daenerys is yet to cross the narrow sea and is still in problems with the Sons of Harpy. Ser Barristan Selmy died and her unsullied army is growing thinner, she is yet to control her dragons. And of course the finale where she was surrounded by tribes

- Westeros is also in a mess. The queen and her brother is locked up. And Cersei is burning with revenge for the High Sparrow. Jaime is returning with (very likely) dead daughter. Tommen is a weak king. The great counsel is technically corrupted (or on travel). What is to come in Westros is chaos, rebellions and conflicts.

- The North appears to be in the gravest danger as we know White Walkers are coming, Jon Snow is dead (might be revived, but still). Sansa and Reek are on the run and as for Bran Stark or Arya Stark they have very little effect on the political and overall state of the realm.

- In conclusion I theorize that the next season is either the most conversational, un-eventual, boring plot that is gradually leading up to the climax. Or it is the climax plot it self where we get to witness awesome stuff like White walker battles the crows, Daenerys with her dragons marching North, Jaime returns and prepares his army to wipe out high sparrow and his followers. Littlefinger makes use of this conflict to his own gain. Arya becomes a professional blind assassin, Bran a super warg, [insert more awesomeness here] And we reach the most extreme point of the show.

OR I could be completely wrong and GoT is going to extend to three or more seasons. What do you guys think?

**TL:DR; Bulletpoint version:**

* Melisandre will disappear with the body of Jon Snow.     
* The Wall will fall and the Army of the dead will pour out over the north.     
* The Faith Militant will storm the castle and take Kings Landing.
* Winterfell is crushed before the might of the Others. The North falls and the army of the dead pours out over the Riverlands.       
* The Others reach and conquer Kings Landing, the Stormlands, Highgarden and ultimately even Dorne.       
* Daenerys remains in Meereen, with Tyrion and is joined by Melisandre, on her way to Asshai with, the now awake Jon Snow.     
* 7 years go by.      
* Jon Stark, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister have become the three Dragon Riders of Meereen.      
* Everyone that managed to get out of Westeros have joined Daenerys and their collected army is ready to march as soon as Spring is more then just a dream.     
* Arya is now a faceless woman in her own right, and a master assassin.      
* They all return to Westeros, the great army of the Dawn.     
* In Westeros some castles have managed to maintain their fortifications against the Others, while others have joined them willingly.       
* Daenrys retakes Kings landing, and walks into an empty throneroom with a broken roof, under the soft snow of early spring. Just like her visions.     
* Bran shows up in Kings Landing. He knows how to defeat the white walkers.      
* It all culminates in one final battle.

Ultimately this was all the story of the hour of the Wolf. A day when men forsook fellowship and abandoned courage.     
The story of how an 8 thousand year old brotherhood fell to corruption and the small minds of small men.      
A story of how 7 kingdoms fell in disarray at exactly the wrong time. Too busy squabbling among themselves to realize the danger they where all in.

Why do I believe this?       
Well lets look at the narrative first. Notice how many of our favorite heroes are now across the narrow sea? Tyrion and Arya are both conveniently placed outside immediate risk, and our author has gone out of his way to ensure the Dany stays out of Westeros. She even makes the decision to rule in Meereen, when by all rights she could have headed for Westeros as soon as she took Yunkai.

And none of these people are in any hurry. Arya is in the middle of her Assassin training, a training that takes YEARS to accomplish, Tyrion and Dany have the Dragons, which have certainly grown, but they have not even BEGUN training them, beyond Drogon giving Dany a ride that one time. Once again, this takes YEARS not weeks or even months.

As for gathering a proper force against the White Walkers, this process is also long and costly, and made impossible by the fact that the Boltons hold the North and the Lannisters the crown and they don't see the danger. 

So what's the alternative here?      
 That the White walkers DON'T break the wall?      
 Ser Alliser Thorne resuces the 7 kingdoms?      
 Some conveniently resurrected version of Jon Snow pops up and in one fell swoop unites the Nights watch with the wildlings AND the north and everything just works out hunky dory? 

**No, this is the Song of Ice and Fire. Zombies will fight Dragons, prophecies will be fulfilled. This premise has been clear from the start.**

So then what, the Army of the dead reaches Kings landing, JUST as Dany arrives and everyone works together and saves the day? Have you not been paying attention?

This is gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets better, and if that means all of Westeros will fall to the Mysterious others, and live 7 years in Winter under their rule, then that's exactly what will happen.

[Think of Dany and Brans visions in the Show.](http://i.imgur.com/tZTXeL2.jpg) An empty throne room, with a broken roof. It doesn't look like she just took it in battle, its an abandoned ruin. Like its not been in use for years, what happened during those years? And why was it abandoned?

There can be no doubt. The White Walkers are the biggest threat Westeros has ever faced and they will conquer and destroy long before they are defeated.

The leader of The Brotherhood is Beric Dondarrion. We are shown that how ever many times he dies, he will be brought back. In the scene where he tells Arya all this he says that: ""Every time I comeback, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."" Something pertinent to point out is that every time he dies, he is brought back in the snap of a finger by Thoros of Myr. He spends very little time in the ""darkness"" as he calls it, so it consumed him very little of him each time. We see a demonstration of the ""darkness"" consuming someone's spirit in Lady Stoneheart. Catelyn Stark was dead and in the river for a pretty long time. That's why her reanimated corpse is so vicious and evil. Every bit of Catelyn was gone by the time Beric found her body. The whole point of this is to directly show how the Jon being resurrected by Melisandre could take a dark turn. The longer he is a corpse the less Jon Snow there would be when Melisandre brought him back. Now a contradiction to this could be Jon warging into Ghost where his mind and personality would be completely safe and secure. But if Jon doesn't warg into Ghost and is in the ""darkness"" then the clock will be ticking before we have ""Lord Stoneheart""
But this is just a theory so tell me your what you think.",31,54,False,self,,,,,

Right now I'm at Season 1 Episode 3, roughly 49 minutes in. The scene where Maester Aemon asks Tyrion how many winters he has seen throughout his life. Tyrion's answer is ""8... No, 9."" Here's the thing though, right before he says ""8"", a voice clearly from behind the camera yells ""*Eight*"" then right before Tyrion says ""9"", the same voice yells ""*Nine*"".

Has anyone else noticed this? Is there any other post-film mistakes the show has made? Am I just hearing things? Nothing too exciting, just thought I'd share seeing as how I never noticed or heard of this before. Kinda interesting.

2814,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-8-31,2015,8,31,2,3iz1ow,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS][RANT] Started rewatching the whole series just about two hours ago and this thought popped into my mind,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3iz1ow/all_spoilersrant_started_rewatching_the_whole/,Richard_Darx,1440954720,"Before you start making opinions about me hating on this show and being too critical about some things, I'd like to let you know that I've been a fan ever since the first episode so if I come off as a dick, I apologize in advance.

EDIT: corrected some mistakes
EDIT2: Few guys here have made some good points that made me question my impulsive 'essay' to some extent

 Alright back onto the topic: So the series starts off with three rangers of the Night's Watch who go looking for wildlings and find a White Walker, who kills two of them and the third one runs away, only to be executed by Eddard Stark. From this, you would think that the White Walkers would play major role in everything what happens next, and the story would be mostly about them, right? Not so much, apparently. 
 Why would GRRM derail the main story so much from that point? You've got all these characters who get so much development over the years and we basically forget about the White Walkers until they make an appearance few seasons later. Not few minutes or episodes. Seasons. And when they do make an appearance, they only do it to scare a fat brother of the Night's Watch and snatch a baby along the way (they do more in the books but we'll get to that). We didn't get to see the battle at the Fist of the First Men. We didn't get to see the White Walker who attacks Samwell, Grenn and Small Paul after they've ran away from the battle. And even if we did, they still don't get enough attention until Hardhome. Gods that was so fucking goooood! MORE things like that!!! Instead we get Hot Pie, Gendry, Obara Sand, Myrcella and Cock Merchant. And there's far more things in the books.

Just like in real life, everything has it's own story that many people don't know or care about. And once the Walkers break through the wall and start swarming through every nook and cranny of seven kingdoms, the quarrels of men with one another won't matter anymore. And the good people don't always win, cousin Orson crushing beetles etc etc. I do get all of that, alright? But come on. That message could have been sent with far less characters/noble houses in the picture and the remaining attention could have been on the White Walkers.

How do they operate? Who are their leaders? Do they have some sort of equivalent of the noble houses of Westeros? Are they individualistic or do they have just one mind? Do they have tactics that don't rely on Zerg Rush of Wights? Any siege machinery? Frozen dragons? What about the giant spiders Bran's creepy babysitter spoke of? Do they care about what happens to their own kind or are they like ""Oh nevermind, I'll just snatch myself another baby and make a new friend. Steve was an asshole anyway"" every time one of them dies?

What do we know about them? Well, we know what they look like. Dragon fire, Valyrian steel and dragon glass hurts them. We know that they have crazy sharp swords that freeze and shatter everything they touch with the exception of Valyrian steel and dragon glass. They PROBABLY can't reproduce, which is why they snatch Craster's babies. They can also raise the dead who respond only to fire and heavy physical trauma after their ressurection. They possess human intelligence (perhaps higher intelligence than that?) and they appear to be exceptional swordsmen. Well, the ones that appeared so far, anyway. They still seemed to rely on the weapon shattering abilities of their swords, though. 

Oh yeah and they're supposedly going to wash over the seven kingdoms like a freezing tsunami with their undead army once the long night comes in the name of the Geat Other, who is the exact opposite of R'hlorr. That's it. Everything past that point is just a speculation. We don't see them worshipping him, which I would assume is what a god of cold, death and darkness wants.
 And you would think that for such a great threat to every character we've grown to love/hate, they'd deserve more attention. I mean, look at other big franchises. In LOTR/Hobbit, we know who orcs are and who they follow. Hell, we even know how they're born! We know who the Nazgl are and how they've become what they are. The same goes for the Empire and Sith from Star Wars and other followers of the Dark Side. Voldemort from Harry Potter franchise is one freaking wizard and gets more attention. His goal is clear. We know about his nonexistand boundaries and we know what his goals are. Why don't we know these things about the White Walkers, if they're as much of a threat to the world of ASOIAF as Voldemort is to the entire world of Harry Potter?

I could probably rant on for a little longer while but I think you get the point I'm trying to make here. I just hope that they will be paid significantly more attention in the following seasons.

TL;DR
Story moved away from White Walkers too much for too long and doesn't give them enough attention they so deserve.

This isn't an insult towards Mr. Dinklage at all, I think he's an amazing actor, it's just that he doesn't portray him correctly. 

* Tyrion is quite ugly.
* He has a darker past and personality than depicted in the show.
* His relationships (specifically with Shae and Jaime) are too heartwarming in the show, whereas in the book they are much darker.
* Tyrion overall, is a much darker character in the books.

So my questions are, as far as a correct portrayal of Tyrion goes, do you believe that Mr. Dinklage was not the correct choice?

Also, do you think audiences would still have liked Book Tyrion? Or the reason there were such dramatic changes to his character were to make him more likable.     

Thanks for reading.

Edit: I understand Mr. Dinklage could've adapted to the personality had he needed to, but he's not a bad looking guy, and this is [Book Tyrion](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mCUpL6XwkLQ/TjdmZ-onEcI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/2jNw5j-e1wk/s1600/Tyrion-Lannister_the-Imp.jpg)",23,0,False,self,,,,,

In Robb's camp, a failed escape attempt by Jaime leaves a guard dead, and Catelyn worries about the camp's desire for retribution. In Qarth, the warlock Pyat Pree reveals to Daenerys that he stole her dragons, but gives her the opportunity to reunite with them before slaughtering the Council of Thirteen and establishing Xaro Xhoan Daxos as king of Qarth. Theon presents to Maester Luwin and his subjects the charred corpses of two boys, informing them that he has tracked down and killed Bran and Rickon Stark.

Tywin Lannister leaves Harrenhal to attack Robb, which leads Arya Stark, Gendry and Hot Pie to attempt an escape with the help of Jaqen H'ghar, who agrees to help in order for Arya to refrain from naming H'ghar himself as the third man to kill. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister attempts to blackmail Tyrion by abducting the prostitute, Ros, whom Cersei believes to be his secret lover. The capital prepares for assault by Stannis, who, underway to King's Landing, promises to make Davos Seaworth his Hand of the King. Beyond the Wall, the Wildling leader ""Rattleshirt"" leads the captured Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand to his king, Mance Rayder. In Qarth, Jorah Mormont agrees to accompany Daenerys into the House of the Undying to retrieve her dragons. In a secret location, Osha schemes to get Bran and Rickon Stark, who are revealed to be very much alive, to safety.
