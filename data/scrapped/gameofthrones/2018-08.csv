9,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-8-1,2018,8,1,12,93l8jy,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS]How would the series have turned out differently if GRRM had done the 5 year jump?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/93l8jy/spoilershow_would_the_series_have_turned_out/,WhiteWolfofUtah,1533092883,"For those that aren't aware, after a Storm of Swords (Basically, after Season 4) GRRM was planning on doing a 5 year time jump. So the 4th book/Season 5 would have opened approximately 5 years after the end of Storm/Season 4. But due to not getting all of the characters in the places that he needed them, he wasn't able to do that, and just wrote the 4th book to take place right after.

It seems like a large majority of the series' issues have stemmed from this lack of a five year jump. It's a comparison that I make a lot, but with the first three books, you can really tell that GRRM had a plan. The first book in particular is so tight and focused, and it seems like GRRM is writing to fulfill his plan. But starting with the 4th book, it really feels like he's writing just to write and see what happens. It doesn't feel like he really had a grand plan anymore, and was just writing things to see what happened. 

If he had utilized the 5 year jump, how do you think the series would have turned out? Where would the characters be? For one, I definitely think that he would have finished the series by now. That may be wishful thinking, but he cranked the first three books out with two years in between each and if he was able to stick to his plan I don't think we would have had the *huge* droughts between the books that we got. In terms of character locations, one of the biggest ones that makes me think is Jon. He would have spent those 5 years being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, so it makes me wonder if he still would have been killed. ",8,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Im sure there are plenty of things I missed but I didnt look anything up, this is just what intrigued me, I dont want it to just be a list of all the differences.


Some things I noticed:

Dany has this dream/memory thing towards the end of the book, and normally I would think nothing of it, but GoT has some insane foreshadowing, so ill definitely keep this in mind


The white walkers being called Others was interesting, I dont think it means too much, could be that the show didnt want them to get confused with the Others from the tv show LOST, or maybe theyre going to be separate things and they were dumbed down for the show or something, idk, doesnt seem like a huge deal just wanted to put it out there.


Jeyne pool was a decently important character it seems, she didnt have a huge role, but in the show most characters have a couple lines or are at least mentioned, im surprised they just completely cut her from the show, especially earlier on when they were trying to stay true to the books. Maybe shes part of a bigger storyline later on that they knew they wouldnt have time for or something with budget maybe?


This one seemed like it could be important later, but I couldnt really figure out anything about it, its just the three eyed raven being called a three eyed crow, I have really no idea why they changed it and what it means, I guess ill just find out as I read, nothing really for that one.


Jeor Mormonts crow was by far the most interesting change, everything else seems pretty subtle and like minor foreshadowing or something, but this seems like it be a major part of the books, I really didnt understand it at all and i excited to find out more about it.


The last thing is a quote from Mirri Maz Dur, something about telling Dany her baby had been dead for years, which just doesnt make any sense, I found nothing on google and a couple days ago posted about it and I got one answer to do with time travel, I didnt look into because I dont want spoilers but that would be crazy, idk could be nothing though.


Alright that was pretty much all I found, if you guys like this then ill do for the other books, takes me about a month each book though so be patient, probably even more so when school starts back up.
Also please no spoilers for further books(broad things are ok, like this will be more important/explained later) but not blatant spoilers, and you can point out stuff I missed too if its important",5,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

So, Littlefinger, yeah? Is it possible his ""plan"" the entire time was...nothing? What if his plan was to disrupt the kingdom so that he could take advantage, but never had an endgame for that chaos.

Is this at all possible? I know the show isn't the best representation of character, but Petyr never seemed like he had a plan, he always seemed like he was just taking advantage of the chaos however he could at that time.

If he always has a backup plan, then he never commits to his first plan, so isn't all of his time spent, you know, guessing? Just always teetering on the edge of what he might want and what he has to do instead. To me, it doesn't seem like a ""plan"" so much as good planning in the moment.

The scene just felt incredibly weak compared to what could have been done.  In the first episode of the series, we see Ned Stark execute a deserter from the Watch and he does so with his sword and a block.  He even says that the person passing the judgment should dole out the punishment.  I think thematically that it would make more sense for Jon to have done the same thing when he executed those who betrayed him.  

I also think that it would have done a lot to show the change in Jon Snow if the show runners are going that route at all.  I know GRRM has stated, and we have seen with Beric Dondarrion, that being resurrected has a tole.  A beheading is a much colder and personal way of executing the Watch members and it would feel uncharacteristic of Jon to do so.  That is why I believe it would have worked so well.

I am just curious what anyone else's thoughts are on the topic and maybe if the hanging does fit better for the story, someone could weigh in on why that is the case.

As an aside, it would have been incredibly bad ass if Jon had done the beheadings.

(not sure if this needs a spoiler tag, but wouldn't want to risk it!)

So, I have watched all of Game of Thrones a couple of times now (and the first two books) and one thing confuses me about Arya. We see from her time with Syrio that she learns a practical form of water dancing (and is ok at it), after she leaves harrenhal and escapes the Brotherhood, and joins the hound, we see her several times ""practising"" her water dancing, but i presume most of it is made up, since it is so unlike her training with Syrio, but is understandable considering it has been 2-3 years since she trained properly. finally, when she trains with the faceless men, she hides needle and the only fight training we see her get is with a staff (nothing like waterdancing, or rapier fighting). What confuses me is how she suddenly gets so badass with needle (as shown in her fight with Brienne in S7) is there anything in the later books or in the shows that describe her Faceless man training?, while not a big detail, as someone who practises HEMA, I do tend to overthink movie/tv sword fighting scenes. But am really curious as to how she is suddenly an expert in sword fighting, even though in universe she has not properly used one for about 4-5 years. thanks for any help you guys can give!",21,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I have seen too many Ollie and Thorne haters that I had to say something. 

We are lead to believe (correctly) that Jon is doing a good thing by forgiving the old grudge between Westeros and the wildlings and creating an alliance to confront the real enemy which is the night king. 

However, those who dont agree with Jon are not entirely without merit. The wall has stood for a thousand years and even when it was poorly manned with only 3 out of 21 castles guarded, the white walkers never dared to approach the wall. This was because the magic woven in the wall rebelled them. However the people of the north were always suffering from the wilding vicious raids and viewed the night watch as protection from the wildlings rather than from the unnatural beings north of the wall. 

So when some people like Thorne and Ollie refuse to accept the alliance with the wildling, they are not being blind to the white walker threat, they just believe that the wall will hold on like it did for thousands of years. And so such alliance was not necessary. 

If Jon has simply allowed the wildling to pass as refugees, and if Mance has come asking for help before attacking the wall. Thorne and the others may have sympathized and accepted it. But the problem was that Jon was treating them like honored allies. And in case of Ollie, he was doing so with those same wildling who butchered his family. You can not ask a kid to be understanding with those who murdered his mother. 

I think Jon carries a big part of the responsibility for failing to explain his position clearly and taking these sensitivities into account.he could have taken measures such as separating the wildling from the night watch quickly instead of surrounding himself with them, or insisting on punishing the few who committed crimes south of the wall to satisfy victims like Ollie. 

Dont get me wrong, I know Jon position is correct, but those who opposed him were not total villains. I think after his resurrection he should have forgiven them in the spirit of needing every living person to fight the against the dead as he has forgiven the wildlings who attacked the wall.

I believe it is created by infusing the molten metal with molten dragonglass during the forging process.

The main reasoning being that dragonglass and Valyrian steel swords are the only two known weapons that can kill a white walker. 

Secondly, Dragonstone has a mine of the stuff, so they probably had the largest known supply more so than anyone else.

Theres also the interesting aspect of both Valyrian Steel and dragonglass that once the Doom of Valyria happened there was a loss of knowledge of both.

Using the real world Obsidian as a reference, I believe like Obsidian being formed by Volcanoes, dragon glass is formed by a massive blast of dragon fire. 

My last point is that I believe dragonfire is needed to melt the dragonglass to then be used in the Valyrian Steel process.

Im not sure how John will come to discover this, maybe Sam will find it in a book, but I think more Valyrian Steel will be made in the last arc.

I've searched around online and haven't seen anyone discuss it. Also haven't seen anyone talk about it on here. So I just wanna throw this out there and see what you all think.

N + L = J.

That's right. Ned plus Lyanna equals Jon.

As far as timelines and all that goes, I don't know if it is logistically possible. (I've only read the books once through so everything is kinda hazy). I know they were at the tourney of Harrenhal together but that's all I know for sure.

I like this theory for a few reasons:

First off, GRRM has made this whole TOJ scenario very ambiguous. There are many theories as to who Jon's parents could be. (There are even theories that there was no baby at all, the baby wasn't even Jon, or there were multiple babies). So for everyone to theorize pretty much every pairing possible except for this one....and then to have it turn out it's actually N + L = J all along...a possible coupling that was there that we didn't consider...it would be interesting and throw us off guard.

Secondly, N + L would obviously mean incest, as Ned and Lyanna are siblings. For Ned to be portrayed as such an honorable, moral-compass driven character, then to find out he was guilty of incestual relations, would be a mind-blowing reveal.

Thirdly, I really like the idea of Jon being a pureblood Stark. Even though he would still be a bastard, he would have more Stark blood than the other Stark children. An N + L = J reveal would be kinda awesome because for all his life, Jon has wanted to be a Stark. Then to have it revealed he's the MOST Stark of all? By blood at least, even if not in name? It would be cool.

Of course I know there are many things to negate this theory, and when it comes down to it most of the ""supporting evidence"" for the theory hangs on your interpretation of Ned's assumed brotherly affections for his sister. But I enjoy indulging in it nonethless. What are your thoughts on it?",26,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

And not just that, but that maybe they are actually each a part of the Azor Ahai prophecy/the meaning of the series' title: A Song of Ice and Fire. This strictly show related. However, the show-runners of Game of Thrones have been told the ending of the series from the man himself, GRRM. So could this possibly be how the book is going to end???? Probably not, but you never know. These are also not my personal opinions. May include spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm not perfect, and some events may be slightly out of order. This was mainly for fun so read for enjoyment. I've broken down the evidence by season so (WARNING HEAVY SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 1-7):

**Season 1:**

**Before the series begins**:

	*Prince/Princess who was promised prophecy (PWWP).*

\- 1/2. Born in sand amongst a bleeding star. This applies to Jon, as we find out in the finale of Season 6 that he was born in the desert region of Westeros called Dorne, while Sir Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn (forged from a falling star) sat beside him freshly covered in blood.

\- Jon's house sigil is a direwolf, a mythical creature. The Starks have pet dire-wolves in the series (although this was the first time on record of this occurring). Jon and the Starks are Ice.

\- 2/2. Born amongst salt and smoke. This applies to Daenerys (Dany), as she was born on Dragonstone, a smoky island off the coast of King's Landing that was the original seat of Aegon the Conqueror and House Targaryen.

\- Dany's family sigil is a dragon, a mythical creature. Their families could ride dragons. Dany and the Targaryens are Fire.

	*Had mother's who died during childbirth.*

\- Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Jon.

\- Rhaella Targaryen died giving birth to Dany.

	*Were hidden at birth and raised in secret.*

\- Jon was raised as the son of Ned Stark, in order to keep the secret that his parents are really Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.

\- Dany was moved from place to place as a child, along with her older brother Viserys, in order to avoid assassins sent by King Robert Baratheon.

	*Can trace their lineage to the Mad king.*

\- Jon is his grandson.

\- Dany is his daughter.

**Series begins:** 

\- Jon leaves his Stark home of Winterfell, and decides to join the Night's Watch, a group that defends the Wall from any threats beyond it.

	*Leave their homes and join a new group*.

\- Dany (begrudgingly) agrees to marry Khal Drogo, the head of a very large Dothraki khalasar, and to join the Dothraki as the khalasar's version of a queen..

	*Begin to thrive in their new groups.*

\- Jon proves that he is much more skilled than any other new recruit, begins training the new recruits, and is named the steward to the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont. This sets up Jon to be a strong candidate for the next Lord Commander.

\- Dany forms a real love and partnership with Drogo, learns the Dothraki language, controls some of their customs and adopts their policies, gains confidence in her role, and grows stronger, even standing up to her abusive brother.

	*Form a valuable friendship.*

\- Jon with Samwell Tarly, a smart but naive recruit and Jon's first friend in the Night's Watch.

\- Dany with Ser Jorah Mormont as a sell-sword/bodyguard from Westeros.

	*Survive a near-death experience.*

\- Jon stops a white that attacks him and his direwolf Ghost inside a Night's Watch tower. This marks the first appearance of a white inside the Wall.

\- Dany is almost poisoned by a wine merchant, but is luckily saved by Ser Jorah.

	*Say goodbye to two people close to them.*

\- Jon receives news that Ned Stark, his ""father"", has been beheaded in King's Landing. Then, his ""uncle"" who is also in the Night's Watch, Benjen Stark, goes missing during a ranging mission. Benjen is presumed dead, and is not seen again until the end of Season 7 as a half-white. 

\- Dany loses Viserys and Khal Drogo. After multiple offenses to both Dany and the Dothraki, Khal Drogo pours molten gold onto the head of her brother Viserys, killing him instantly. Then, Drogo suffers from an infected cut and the blood-magic of a scorned witch, which leads to his death.

	*Given powerful weapons.*

\- Jon, receives a Valyrian steel sword from Jeor Mormont after saving his life from the white. Valyrian steel is the strongest and lightest steel in the world, and only a few swords remain in the Seven-Kingdoms.

\- In the Season 1 finale, Dany manages to hatch three baby dragons from petrified eggs, by climbing into Drogo's funeral pyre. Creatures who were thought to have been extinct for over one-hundred years.

	*Start journeys of Ice and Fire.*

\- Jon, and his fellow Night's Watch members start a journey to the icy, cold, deep-north, in order to find out what has been happening beyond the wall. Rumors swirl of white-walker sightings, and of the largest wild-ling army to ever exist.

\- Dany, after hatching her dragons, takes her remaining khalasar into the hot, desert terrain, to find a place to keep them safe and plan her next move towards retaking her home and all of Westeros.

**Season 2:**

	*Trekking through a wasteland.*

\- Jon, and his weather-torn group, are looking for reports of the largest wildling army to ever exist. As well as suitable shelter to escape the fierce ice and cold.

\- Dany, and her weather-torn group, looking for shelter from the fierce heat and fire of the Red Waste.

	*Enjoy their new roles.*

\- Jon also begins to come into his own as a Night's Watch member. He's volunteering for duties, teaching new recruits, and no longer carrying a chip on his shoulder.

\- Dany begins to come into her own as leader of her khalasar. The shy girl from the first season is almost gone.

	*Opposite sex advances.*

\- While Jon is on a scouting mission, he comes across a few wild-lings. One is a female named Ygritte, who Jon takes captive. While captive, Ygritte makes many sexual advances toward Jon, and every time she is rejected.

\- When Dany makes it to the end of the Red Waste, she is invited into a city called Qarth. Within Qarth thirteen members make up a council that together rule the city. One member is man known as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, or the Spice King. Daxos proposes marriage to Dany many times, and every time he is rejected.

	*Taken captive*.

\- While Jon has Ygritte captive, she manages to escape, lure Jon into an ambush, and take him as her prisoner.

\- While a guest within Qarth, warlocks use magic and betrayal to steal Dany's dragons and lure her into their tower of a hideout. Once within the tower and past her visions (will discuss next), she is put into chains by the warlocks. She manages to escape by having her three dragons burn the warlock in front of her.

	*Gain knowledge from enemies*.

\- Jon and his group come to a house known as Craster's Keep, belonging to a man known for housing the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Jon comes to find out that Craster marries all his daughter's, they have his children, and the cycle repeats. If that wasn't bad enough, he then finds out Craster has been giving all of his son's to the White-Walkers (WW), as a sacrifice so they would leave him in peace.

\- When Dany first enters the warlocks' tower, she begins to have visions. One is of King's Landing , only it's ruined and covered in snowy ash. (Possibly foreshadowing the series finale?????) After Dany escapes the visions and is put into chains, the warlocks' explain to tell her that her dragons are the source of the warlock's restored magic. Meaning it's possible her dragons brought magic back into the world.

	*Make a bold decision and head into the unknown.*

\- Now that Jon is a wild-ling captive, he makes the choice to go undercover and infiltrate the supposed ""largest wild-ling army ever"", by killing a fellow Night's Watchmen, Qhorin Half-Hand (Qhorin's idea). By doing so, the wild-lings believe he is a true deserter of the Night's Watch, keeping his cover for now.

\- After getting revenge on those within Qarth who plotted to steal her dragons and potentially harm her, Dany decides to take the now deceased Spice King's ships deeper into Essos towards Astapor and Slaver's Bay. This decision is bold because Dany doesn't know much about Essos and it's lands, and also it's the opposite direction of Westeros and the Iron Throne, Dany's ultimate goal.

**Season 3:**

	*Pretend to be naive and but up a powerful bluff.*

\- In the deep North, Jon is under watch by the wild-lings, as few truly believe he has left the Night's Watch. His bluff is working, for now.

\- Once is Astapor, Dany meets a slaver who frequently insults her in Valyrian. Little does he know Valyrian is Dany's native tongue, and Dany uses this to her advantage. Dany strikes up a bargain with the slaver: one dragon for eight-thousand Unsullied soldiers. Some of the fiercest warriors in the world. Dany is told by many not to make the deal, as a dragon is too powerful, but she is confident in her decision. When the time comes to make the deal, Dany commands one of her dragons to kill the slave-master, and takes the Unsullied for her own.

	*Overcome a large obstacle.*

\- As a wild-ling, Jon and a small group are tasked with climbing the Wall itself. After almost falling on the way up, Jon survives the climb, largely with the help of Ygritte.

\- After Astapor, Dany sets her sights on the city of Yunkai. The Yunkai send sell-swords named the Second Sons to fight Dany's army, and one in particular named Daario Naharis to kill Dany. Daario decides to instead join Dany, and with his help, Dany's army conquers Yunkai.

	*Intimate relationships.*

\- After the thrill of conquering the Wall, Jon and Ygritte start an intimate relationship, but this one becomes serious. They form a relationship based on real love.

\- Dany feels an initial attraction to Daario, and although they don't officially hook-up until Season 4, they form a ""friends-with-benefits"" relationship. Her first since the death of Drogo at the end of Season 1.

	*Begin to become true leaders.*

\- After escaping the wild-ling camp, and taking multiple arrows from Ygritte and his way out, Jon makes it back to the Wall and Castle Black. The first time in two seasons. He is now battle-tested, knows the wild-lings, and is ready to become a leader when his men need him most.

\- Dany has now conquered and liberated two cities. She has three dragons, an army, and thousands of former slaves following her. The freed slaves have even taken to calling her ""mhysa"", which means Mother. She is becoming a queen.

**Season 4:**

	*Fight for a moral high-ground.*

\- Now that Jon has returned to The Wall, he is immediately faced with a problem. While Jon was undercover with the wild-lings, the Night's Watch party he began with were attacked by whites. The surviving men went to Craster's Keep, and while there, led a mutiny that resulted in Craster's death. As well as the death of their own Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont. Jon volunteers to take down the mutiny on the moral obligation to get revenge for his Lord Commander, but also because Jon grossly exaggerated the numbers of the Night's Watch. If the wild-lings make it to Crater's Keep and find out the real numbers, the wild-lings would attack the Wall and easily take it.

\- Dany has now conquered two cities in Slaver's Bay, and makes her way towards a third, the city of Meereen. After approaching the city, and having Daario Naharis defeat Meereen's champion outside the city gates, Dany launches the collars of all the slaves she has already freed into the city. This sends a message that she is done with slavery, and anyone who joins her will never again be put into chains.

	*Answer injustice with justice.*

\- As mentioned above, Jon is on the way to put down the mutiny at Craster's. And as much as this was done to make sure the Night's Watch members there don't tell any wild-lings their true numbers, this was also done to get justice for Jeor. Jeor made Jon his steward, gifted him a Valyrian steel sword, mentored him like a father, and helped him grow into a man and a leader. Jon wants to avenge Jeor, and get some kind of justice against his fellow Night's Watch members that killed their own leader.

\- Dany dispatches her Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen, start a slave revolt, and then open the city gates for the rest of her army. The plan works, and the city is hers. She then has 163 Great Masters killed, in response to the 163 children that were killed and strung-up along the path from Yunkai to Meereen.

	*Forced to cage their beasts*.

\- While putting down the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jon reunites with his direwolf Ghost, who he had not seen since being capture by wild-lings in Season 2. But once he returns to Castle Black, he is ordered by Alliser Thorne, a high-raking member of the Watch that also hates Jon, to cage Ghost. Or risk it becoming food for the men.

\- While in Meereen, a shepherd brings Dany the bones of his daughter, who was accidentally killed by her largest Dragon, Drogon. In response, Dany agrees to cage her dragons under the Great Pyramid of Meereen. She isn't able to catch Drogon, so only her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are successfully caged.

**Season 5:**

	*Tempted by lineage.*

\- After the remaining wild-ling army was smashed by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of former King Robert and technically the true king of Westeros , Stannis takes refuge at Castle Black. While there he makes Jon an offer, join him and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. After some consideration, Jon declines, stating he made a vow to the Night's Watch.

\- Meereen is growing chaotic. Former slaves and masters are constantly fighting, and a secret organization known as the Sons of the Harpy are killing Unsullied soldiers. One such Harpy is found, and Dany at first wants the man executed. Her adviser, Ser Barristan Selmy, argues the man should have a trial. He then warns her of how her father, the Mad-King, acted. He went for execution over trial, and soon lost himself inside his own murderous desires.

	*Granted official titles.*

\- At Castle Black, it's now time to elect a new Lord Commander. At first, Alliser Thorne is the clear favorite and seems to have the election locked up. But then Samwell Tarly gives a passionate speech for Jon, and it's enough to sway his fellow men, leading Jon to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

\- In order to keep the piece in Meereen, Dany agrees to marry a noble from one of the city's most well-known houses, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Through this marriage, she is officially the Queen of Meereen, to those who already saw her this way and to the nobles who refused her claim..

	*Working with different groups isn't easy.*

\- Things at Castle Black aren't going so well. Lord Stannis expects his troops taken care of, and is even trying to recruit wild-lings to his cause, a move that upsets the Night's Watch. The Night's Watch want revenge against any remaining wild-lings. The wild-lings that survived want revenge against the Night's Watch. And members of the Night's Watch are growing uneasy with: their new Lord Commander, lack of men and supplies, and wild-lings and Stannis' men always around them. This comes to a blow when Janos Slynt, the man responsible for betraying New Stark back in Season 1, publicly refuses the orders given by Jon. Jon responds by publicly executing Slynt, a move that pleases some and angers others.

\- Meereen is still at odds. Former slaves hate former masters, and vice versa. One slave murders the man that Dany wanted to put on trial. To try and fix the situation, Dany has that slave publicly executed. The other former slaves immediately turn on her, and any masters preset. Neither group is any happier, and worst now Dany has lost members from the one group that was originally with her.

	*Working with the enemy.*

\- Jon must also work with his enemies. The Wall needs more men, and one of Jon's duties is to ask the lords of Westeros to send anyone they can spare. This includes Roose Bolton, the current warden of the North who betrayed the Starks and stole Winterfell. At first Jon refuses to send a letter to Roose, but is reminded the Night's Watch remains neutral. So he reluctantly asks. His next move is even bolder, he plans to allow the wild-lings to pass through the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms, or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, but he points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected, and then added to the White Walkers ever-growing army. Jon then leads a rescue mission to a place beyond-the-wall called Hardhome, in order to save wild-lings who were separated during Stannis' attack. The mission is a success, however; bringing even more wild-lings into Castle Black does not go over well with many of the Night's Watch.

\- As mentioned above, Dany marries a noblemen in order to better unite Meereen. And she also agrees to re-open the fighting pits to freedman only, something she has constantly been against. This move is a way of showing the masters she can respect their old traditions. And during her fist visit to a fighting pit practice exhibition, she is given a gift, Tyrion Lannister. All Dany knows of house Lannister is that they played a role in casting out her family, so naturally Tyrion is first seen as an enemy. But after some discussion, Dany agrees to allow Tyrion to counsel her. His knowledge of ruling and of Westeros are of great value.

	*Consequences of one's actions.*

\- The night Jon returns from Hardhome, his squire Olly comes and tells him one of the wild-lings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen Stark, who has been missing since Season 1. Jon goes down and follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked ""Traitor"". Thorne, Olly, and other members of the Night's Watch begin to stab Jon, each saying ""For the Watch"". Jon siding with the wild-lings may have been the right decision, but men who have fought them all their lives did not seen it this way. Jon collapses and seemingly dies from his wounds, bleeding out onto the cold snow.

\- Dany is in attendance at the official opening of the fighting pits. Lately things in Meereen have cooled down, and everyone has relaxed their guard. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering both masters and freedmen alike  Hizdahr included. The new found peace was simply a distraction for this main attack. Dany and her companions are pushed toward the center of the pit, and just when they look to be in trouble, Drogon swoops down, defends Dany, and then leaves with her to an unknown location. Her city is at war again, this time without its queen.

**Season 6:**

	*Both are reborn, new, and improved?*

\- Jon was last seen bleeding out from his wounds delivered by his fellow Night's Watch members. The worst happens, and Jon dies. But Ser Davos isn't giving up. He enlists the help of the Red Witch Melisandre, to see if she can resurrect him. She is reluctant, but tries anyways. She preforms her spell, and it looks like it failed. But as everyone is leaving, Jon Snow opens his eyes, alive once again. His death also allows him to leave the Night's Watch, as his vows end now that he has died.

\- After Drogon takes Dany away from Meereen, she is met by a massive Dothraki khalasar. She is taken prisoner, but once it's discovered she was married to a Khal, she is told she must join the Dosh Khalleen. A group of all the wives of fallen Khals. This doesn't sit well with Dany. All the Khals from across the land are gathered in their city Vaes Dothrak, and are deciding if Dany is allowed to join the Khalleen. Dany has another idea. She traps the Khals inside their meeting hut, sets the place on fire killing them all, and emerges reborn from fire once again as Daenerys Targaryen, the Unburnt.

	*Revenge.*

\- A newly resurrected Jon has to take care of some unfinished business. The Night's Watchmen who killed him had all been captured, and were to face justice. Jon offers Thorne, Olly, and two other men a chance for any last words, and then has all four publicly hung. Revenge is his, even if it isn't so sweet.

\- As mentioned above, Dany kills all the former Khals. They took her prisoner, insulted her, would have raped her, abused her, and would have made her remain a Dosh Khalleen. Her revenge was swift and powerful.

	*Form a new army.*

\- Now that Jon is no longer apart of the Night's Watch, he isn't sure what to do. That changes when his ""sister"", Sansa Stark, arrives at Castle Black. She informs him that she ran from Winterfell, where she was married to the abusive Ramsay Bolton, and that his forces are looking for her. They eventually devise a plan to take back Winterfell, and defeat the Boltons. To do so, Jon and his allies ask any northern lords who haven't joined the Boltons to fight with him, as well as the wild-lings. Some agree, and an army is formed, but one smaller than they need.

\- Once Dany burns all the Khals, she asks all the Dothraki to join her and her cause. They all agree, and suddenly Dany has a much larger force.

	*Fight for their future.*

\- Jon, and his out-numbered men, get ready to battle the Bolton's army for control of the North. They have a plan to make up for their lack of men, but that goes away once Ramsay releases Jon's youngest ""brother"" Rickon and has him run across the battlefield, while he shoots arrows at him. Jon makes it feet away from Rickon, right before an arrow hits and kills him. Enraged, Jon attacks the whole army, and his men follow. The battle is fierce, but it seems Ramsay has led Jon into a trap. Right when hope is lost, Sansa comes in with the Knights of the Vale and smash Ramsay's forces. Jon follows a fleeing Ramsay to Winterfell, and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Ramsay. The battle is won, and once again Starks rule Winterfell. 

\- While Dany has been gone, Tyrion has ruled Meereen in her place. He's a good ruler, but not as threatening as ""the mother of dragons"". So finally, all the slavers from Slaver's Bay begin an assault on Meereen. Just then, Dany and Drogon arrive and ready for battle. With a newly freed Rhaegal and Viserion, Dany and her three dragons begin burning the Slaver's fleet. They quickly begin retreating, but a message must be sent, so Dany has 2/3 of the former high-masters executed, and tells the third to spread the tale of what happened here. Of what happened when slavery tried to return to Meereen. 

	*Begin a new chapter, stronger than ever.*

\- With the battle won the North is safe, and a Stark once again holds the North and Winterfell. Now they must figure out what's next. A lot of powerful, northern houses have been hurt in the constant warfare, and someone needs to lead. Lyanna Mormont, the new leader of House Mormont, stands and makes a case for Jon Snow. Although he's a Snow, he's still a Stark, and for the most part a Stark has always ruled the North. This fact, and Jon's proven merit, sway the other lords in attendance, and soon chants of ""the White Wolf"" and ""King of the North"" are shouted by almost everyone. Jon hesitantly, accepts the honor, out of duty and not for personal glory. A new chapter begins, and from a bastard to King of the North! 

\- Now that the slavers have been put down, ships and soldiers are plentiful, and the dragons are battle-ready, Dany is ready to set sail for Westeros. She has three dragons, and Unsullied army, a Dothraki horde, and alliances with both House Tyrell and Martell, two old and respected houses in Westeros. A new chapter begins, one that finally has Dany in Westeros!

**Season 7:**

	*Plan for the future.*

\- Now as King of the North, Jon has more responsibility than ever. But the biggest threat is still that beyond the Wall, the WWs. Jon begins planning his tactics, one of which is convincing those in Westeros that the threat is even real.

\- Now in Westeros, Dany plans to fight for the Iron Throne, and the Lannisters are her target. With all her strength at the ready, she and her advisers plan for war. 

	*End of similarities (mostly), because the meeting is here!*

\- Dany is advised to invite Jon to Dragonstone, as he is gaining quite a reputation. 

\- Jon agrees and he and Davos make the journey. 

\- Jon arrives, and Ice and Fire are officially united!!!!!!!!!! 

\- Instantly the contrasts in styles are on full display. Jon is relaxed and focused on the bigger threat (Ice), while 

 Dany is aggressive and more power-hungry (Fire).

\- Both at some point in the season go into battle, and each put themselves on the front-line. 

Over the course of the rest of the season, their bond grows stronger. And finally, in the season finale, they hook up for the first time. This sets the stage for a wedding, and maybe even a child in Season 8?

That's all! A lot of info, but after seeing all their similarities it seems very much like Jon and Dany are the embodiment of Ice and Fire. I'm not sure how the book will deal with the Azor Ahai prophecy, but it seems like the show is simplifying it, and making Jon and Dany each a half of the prophecy. It works! And who knows, this could all be right. Or completely wrong. Just my interpretation of the material. Thanks for the read! ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

And not just that, but that maybe they are actually each a part of the Azor Ahai prophecy/the meaning of the series' title: A Song of Ice and Fire. This strictly show related. However, the show-runners of Game of Thrones have been told the ending of the series from the man himself, GRRM. So could this possibly be how the book is going to end???? Probably not, but you never know. These are also not my personal opinions. May include spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm not perfect, and some events may be slightly out of order. This was mainly for fun so read for enjoyment. I've broken down the evidence by season so (WARNING HEAVY SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 1-7):

**Season 1:**

**Before the series begins**:

* *Prince/Princess who was promised prophecy (PWWP).*

\- 1/2. Born in sand amongst a bleeding star. This applies to Jon, as we find out in the finale of Season 6 that he was born in the desert region of Westeros called Dorne, while Sir Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn (forged from a falling star) sat beside him freshly covered in blood.

\- Jon's house sigil is a direwolf, a mythical creature. The Starks have pet dire-wolves in the series (although this was the first time on record of this occurring). Jon and the Starks are Ice.

\- 2/2. Born amongst salt and smoke. This applies to Daenerys (Dany), as she was born on Dragonstone, a smoky island off the coast of King's Landing that was the original seat of Aegon the Conqueror and House Targaryen.

\- Dany's family sigil is a dragon, a mythical creature. Their families could ride dragons. Dany and the Targaryens are Fire.

* *Had mother's who died during childbirth.*

\- Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Jon.

\- Rhaella Targaryen died giving birth to Dany.

* *Were hidden at birth and raised in secret.*

\- Jon was raised as the son of Ned Stark, in order to keep the secret that his parents are really Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.

\- Dany was moved from place to place as a child, along with her older brother Viserys, in order to avoid assassins sent by King Robert Baratheon.

* *Can trace their lineage to the Mad king.*

\- Jon is his grandson.

\- Dany is his daughter.

**Series begins:** 

* *Leave their homes and join a new group*.

\- Jon leaves his Stark home of Winterfell, and decides to join the Night's Watch, a group that defends the Wall from any threats beyond it.

\- Dany (begrudgingly) agrees to marry Khal Drogo, the head of a very large Dothraki khalasar, and to join the Dothraki as the khalasar's version of a queen..

* *Begin to thrive in their new groups.*

\- Jon proves that he is much more skilled than any other new recruit, begins training the new recruits, and is named the steward to the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont. This sets up Jon to be a strong candidate for the next Lord Commander.

\- Dany forms a real love and partnership with Drogo, learns the Dothraki language, controls some of their customs and adopts their policies, gains confidence in her role, and grows stronger, even standing up to her abusive brother.

* *Form a valuable friendship.*

\- Jon with Samwell Tarly, a smart but naive recruit and Jon's first friend in the Night's Watch.

\- Dany with Ser Jorah Mormont as a sell-sword/bodyguard from Westeros.

* *Survive a near-death experience.*

\- Jon stops a white that attacks him and his direwolf Ghost inside a Night's Watch tower. This marks the first appearance of a white inside the Wall.

\- Dany is almost poisoned by a wine merchant, but is luckily saved by Ser Jorah.

* *Say goodbye to two people close to them.*

\- Jon receives news that Ned Stark, his ""father"", has been beheaded in King's Landing. Then, his ""uncle"" who is also in the Night's Watch, Benjen Stark, goes missing during a ranging mission. Benjen is presumed dead, and is not seen again until the end of Season 7 as a half-white. 

\- Dany loses Viserys and Khal Drogo. After multiple offenses to both Dany and the Dothraki, Khal Drogo pours molten gold onto the head of her brother Viserys, killing him instantly. Then, Drogo suffers from an infected cut and the blood-magic of a scorned witch, which leads to his death.

* *Given powerful weapons*

\- Jon, receives a Valyrian steel sword from Jeor Mormont after saving his life from the white. Valyrian steel is the strongest and lightest steel in the world, and only a few swords remain in the Seven-Kingdoms.

\- In the Season 1 finale, Dany manages to hatch three baby dragons from petrified eggs, by climbing into Drogo's funeral pyre. Creatures who were thought to have been extinct for over one-hundred years.

* *Start journeys of Ice and Fire.*

\- Jon, and his fellow Night's Watch members start a journey to the icy, cold, deep-north, in order to find out what has been happening beyond the wall. Rumors swirl of white-walker sightings, and of the largest wild-ling army to ever exist.

\- Dany, after hatching her dragons, takes her remaining khalasar into the hot, desert terrain, to find a place to keep them safe and plan her next move towards retaking her home and all of Westeros.

**Season 2:**

* *Trekking through a wasteland.*

\- Jon, and his weather-torn group, are looking for reports of the largest wildling army to ever exist. As well as suitable shelter to escape the fierce ice and cold.

\- Dany, and her weather-torn group, looking for shelter from the fierce heat and fire of the Red Waste.

* *Enjoy their new roles.*

\- Jon also begins to come into his own as a Night's Watch member. He's volunteering for duties, teaching new recruits, and no longer carrying a chip on his shoulder.

\- Dany begins to come into her own as leader of her khalasar. The shy girl from the first season is almost gone.

* *Opposite sex advances.*

\- While Jon is on a scouting mission, he comes across a few wild-lings. One is a female named Ygritte, who Jon takes captive. While captive, Ygritte makes many sexual advances toward Jon, and every time she is rejected.

\- When Dany makes it to the end of the Red Waste, she is invited into a city called Qarth. Within Qarth thirteen members make up a council that together rule the city. One member is man known as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, or the Spice King. Daxos proposes marriage to Dany many times, and every time he is rejected.

* *Taken captive*.

\- While Jon has Ygritte captive, she manages to escape, lure Jon into an ambush, and take him as her prisoner.

\- While a guest within Qarth, warlocks use magic and betrayal to steal Dany's dragons and lure her into their tower of a hideout. Once within the tower and past her visions (will discuss next), she is put into chains by the warlocks. She manages to escape by having her three dragons burn the warlock in front of her.

* *Gain knowledge from enemies*.

\- Jon and his group come to a house known as Craster's Keep, belonging to a man known for housing the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Jon comes to find out that Craster marries all his daughter's, they have his children, and the cycle repeats. If that wasn't bad enough, he then finds out Craster has been giving all of his son's to the White-Walkers (WW), as a sacrifice so they would leave him in peace.

\- When Dany first enters the warlocks' tower, she begins to have visions. One is of King's Landing , only it's ruined and covered in snowy ash. (Possibly foreshadowing the series finale?????) After Dany escapes the visions and is put into chains, the warlocks' explain to tell her that her dragons are the source of the warlock's restored magic. Meaning it's possible her dragons brought magic back into the world.

* *Make a bold decision and head into the unknown.*

\- Now that Jon is a wild-ling captive, he makes the choice to go undercover and infiltrate the supposed ""largest wild-ling army ever"", by killing a fellow Night's Watchmen, Qhorin Half-Hand (Qhorin's idea). By doing so, the wild-lings believe he is a true deserter of the Night's Watch, keeping his cover for now.

\- After getting revenge on those within Qarth who plotted to steal her dragons and potentially harm her, Dany decides to take the now deceased Spice King's ships deeper into Essos towards Astapor and Slaver's Bay. This decision is bold because Dany doesn't know much about Essos and it's lands, and also it's the opposite direction of Westeros and the Iron Throne, Dany's ultimate goal.

**Season 3:**

* *Pretend to be naive and but up a powerful bluff.*

\- In the deep North, Jon is under watch by the wild-lings, as few truly believe he has left the Night's Watch. His bluff is working, for now.

\- Once is Astapor, Dany meets a slaver who frequently insults her in Valyrian. Little does he know Valyrian is Dany's native tongue, and Dany uses this to her advantage. Dany strikes up a bargain with the slaver: one dragon for eight-thousand Unsullied soldiers. Some of the fiercest warriors in the world. Dany is told by many not to make the deal, as a dragon is too powerful, but she is confident in her decision. When the time comes to make the deal, Dany commands one of her dragons to kill the slave-master, and takes the Unsullied for her own.

* *Overcome a large obstacle.*

\- As a wild-ling, Jon and a small group are tasked with climbing the Wall itself. After almost falling on the way up, Jon survives the climb, largely with the help of Ygritte.

\- After Astapor, Dany sets her sights on the city of Yunkai. The Yunkai send sell-swords named the Second Sons to fight Dany's army, and one in particular named Daario Naharis to kill Dany. Daario decides to instead join Dany, and with his help, Dany's army conquers Yunkai.

* *Intimate relationships.*

\- After the thrill of conquering the Wall, Jon and Ygritte start an intimate relationship, but this one becomes serious. They form a relationship based on real love.

\- Dany feels an initial attraction to Daario, and although they don't officially hook-up until Season 4, they form a ""friends-with-benefits"" relationship. Her first since the death of Drogo at the end of Season 1.

* *Begin to become true leaders.*

\- After escaping the wild-ling camp, and taking multiple arrows from Ygritte and his way out, Jon makes it back to the Wall and Castle Black. The first time in two seasons. He is now battle-tested, knows the wild-lings, and is ready to become a leader when his men need him most.

\- Dany has now conquered and liberated two cities. She has three dragons, an army, and thousands of former slaves following her. The freed slaves have even taken to calling her ""mhysa"", which means Mother. She is becoming a queen.

**Season 4:**

* *Fight for a moral high-ground.*

\- Now that Jon has returned to The Wall, he is immediately faced with a problem. While Jon was undercover with the wild-lings, the Night's Watch party he began with were attacked by whites. The surviving men went to Craster's Keep, and while there, led a mutiny that resulted in Craster's death. As well as the death of their own Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont. Jon volunteers to take down the mutiny on the moral obligation to get revenge for his Lord Commander, but also because Jon grossly exaggerated the numbers of the Night's Watch. If the wild-lings make it to Crater's Keep and find out the real numbers, the wild-lings would attack the Wall and easily take it.

\- Dany has now conquered two cities in Slaver's Bay, and makes her way towards a third, the city of Meereen. After approaching the city, and having Daario Naharis defeat Meereen's champion outside the city gates, Dany launches the collars of all the slaves she has already freed into the city. This sends a message that she is done with slavery, and anyone who joins her will never again be put into chains.

* *Answer injustice with justice.*

\- As mentioned above, Jon is on the way to put down the mutiny at Craster's. And as much as this was done to make sure the Night's Watch members there don't tell any wild-lings their true numbers, this was also done to get justice for Jeor. Jeor made Jon his steward, gifted him a Valyrian steel sword, mentored him like a father, and helped him grow into a man and a leader. Jon wants to avenge Jeor, and get some kind of justice against his fellow Night's Watch members that killed their own leader.

\- Dany dispatches her Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen, start a slave revolt, and then open the city gates for the rest of her army. The plan works, and the city is hers. She then has 163 Great Masters killed, in response to the 163 children that were killed and strung-up along the path from Yunkai to Meereen.

* *Forced to cage their beasts*.

\- While putting down the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jon reunites with his direwolf Ghost, who he had not seen since being capture by wild-lings in Season 2. But once he returns to Castle Black, he is ordered by Alliser Thorne, a high-raking member of the Watch that also hates Jon, to cage Ghost. Or risk it becoming food for the men.

\- While in Meereen, a shepherd brings Dany the bones of his daughter, who was accidentally killed by her largest Dragon, Drogon. In response, Dany agrees to cage her dragons under the Great Pyramid of Meereen. She isn't able to catch Drogon, so only her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are successfully caged.

**Season 5:**

* *Tempted by lineage.*

\- After the remaining wild-ling army was smashed by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of former King Robert and technically the true king of Westeros , Stannis takes refuge at Castle Black. While there he makes Jon an offer, join him and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. After some consideration, Jon declines, stating he made a vow to the Night's Watch.

\- Meereen is growing chaotic. Former slaves and masters are constantly fighting, and a secret organization known as the Sons of the Harpy are killing Unsullied soldiers. One such Harpy is found, and Dany at first wants the man executed. Her adviser, Ser Barristan Selmy, argues the man should have a trial. He then warns her of how her father, the Mad-King, acted. He went for execution over trial, and soon lost himself inside his own murderous desires.

* *Granted official titles.*

\- At Castle Black, it's now time to elect a new Lord Commander. At first, Alliser Thorne is the clear favorite and seems to have the election locked up. But then Samwell Tarly gives a passionate speech for Jon, and it's enough to sway his fellow men, leading Jon to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

\- In order to keep the piece in Meereen, Dany agrees to marry a noble from one of the city's most well-known houses, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Through this marriage, she is officially the Queen of Meereen, to those who already saw her this way and to the nobles who refused her claim..

* *Working with different groups isn't easy.*

\- Things at Castle Black aren't going so well. Lord Stannis expects his troops taken care of, and is even trying to recruit wild-lings to his cause, a move that upsets the Night's Watch. The Night's Watch want revenge against any remaining wild-lings. The wild-lings that survived want revenge against the Night's Watch. And members of the Night's Watch are growing uneasy with: their new Lord Commander, lack of men and supplies, and wild-lings and Stannis' men always around them. This comes to a blow when Janos Slynt, the man responsible for betraying New Stark back in Season 1, publicly refuses the orders given by Jon. Jon responds by publicly executing Slynt, a move that pleases some and angers others.

\- Meereen is still at odds. Former slaves hate former masters, and vice versa. One slave murders the man that Dany wanted to put on trial. To try and fix the situation, Dany has that slave publicly executed. The other former slaves immediately turn on her, and any masters preset. Neither group is any happier, and worst now Dany has lost members from the one group that was originally with her.

* *Working with the enemy.*

\- Jon must also work with his enemies. The Wall needs more men, and one of Jon's duties is to ask the lords of Westeros to send anyone they can spare. This includes Roose Bolton, the current warden of the North who betrayed the Starks and stole Winterfell. At first Jon refuses to send a letter to Roose, but is reminded the Night's Watch remains neutral. So he reluctantly asks. His next move is even bolder, he plans to allow the wild-lings to pass through the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms, or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, but he points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected, and then added to the White Walkers ever-growing army. Jon then leads a rescue mission to a place beyond-the-wall called Hardhome, in order to save wild-lings who were separated during Stannis' attack. The mission is a success, however; bringing even more wild-lings into Castle Black does not go over well with many of the Night's Watch.

\- As mentioned above, Dany marries a noblemen in order to better unite Meereen. And she also agrees to re-open the fighting pits to freedman only, something she has constantly been against. This move is a way of showing the masters she can respect their old traditions. And during her fist visit to a fighting pit practice exhibition, she is given a gift, Tyrion Lannister. All Dany knows of house Lannister is that they played a role in casting out her family, so naturally Tyrion is first seen as an enemy. But after some discussion, Dany agrees to allow Tyrion to counsel her. His knowledge of ruling and of Westeros are of great value.

* *Consequences of one's actions.*

\- The night Jon returns from Hardhome, his squire Olly comes and tells him one of the wild-lings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen Stark, who has been missing since Season 1. Jon goes down and follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked ""Traitor"". Thorne, Olly, and other members of the Night's Watch begin to stab Jon, each saying ""For the Watch"". Jon siding with the wild-lings may have been the right decision, but men who have fought them all their lives did not seen it this way. Jon collapses and seemingly dies from his wounds, bleeding out onto the cold snow.

\- Dany is in attendance at the official opening of the fighting pits. Lately things in Meereen have cooled down, and everyone has relaxed their guard. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering both masters and freedmen alike  Hizdahr included. The new found peace was simply a distraction for this main attack. Dany and her companions are pushed toward the center of the pit, and just when they look to be in trouble, Drogon swoops down, defends Dany, and then leaves with her to an unknown location. Her city is at war again, this time without its queen.

**Season 6:**

* *Both are reborn, new, and improved?*

\- Jon was last seen bleeding out from his wounds delivered by his fellow Night's Watch members. The worst happens, and Jon dies. But Ser Davos isn't giving up. He enlists the help of the Red Witch Melisandre, to see if she can resurrect him. She is reluctant, but tries anyways. She preforms her spell, and it looks like it failed. But as everyone is leaving, Jon Snow opens his eyes, alive once again. His death also allows him to leave the Night's Watch, as his vows end now that he has died.

\- After Drogon takes Dany away from Meereen, she is met by a massive Dothraki khalasar. She is taken prisoner, but once it's discovered she was married to a Khal, she is told she must join the Dosh Khalleen. A group of all the wives of fallen Khals. This doesn't sit well with Dany. All the Khals from across the land are gathered in their city Vaes Dothrak, and are deciding if Dany is allowed to join the Khalleen. Dany has another idea. She traps the Khals inside their meeting hut, sets the place on fire killing them all, and emerges reborn from fire once again as Daenerys Targaryen, the Unburnt.

* *Revenge.*

\- A newly resurrected Jon has to take care of some unfinished business. The Night's Watchmen who killed him had all been captured, and were to face justice. Jon offers Thorne, Olly, and two other men a chance for any last words, and then has all four publicly hung. Revenge is his, even if it isn't so sweet.

\- As mentioned above, Dany kills all the former Khals. They took her prisoner, insulted her, would have raped her, abused her, and would have made her remain a Dosh Khalleen. Her revenge was swift and powerful.

* *Form a new army.*

\- Now that Jon is no longer apart of the Night's Watch, he isn't sure what to do. That changes when his ""sister"", Sansa Stark, arrives at Castle Black. She informs him that she ran from Winterfell, where she was married to the abusive Ramsay Bolton, and that his forces are looking for her. They eventually devise a plan to take back Winterfell, and defeat the Boltons. To do so, Jon and his allies ask any northern lords who haven't joined the Boltons to fight with him, as well as the wild-lings. Some agree, and an army is formed, but one smaller than they need.

\- Once Dany burns all the Khals, she asks all the Dothraki to join her and her cause. They all agree, and suddenly Dany has a much larger force.

* *Fight for their future.*

\- Jon, and his out-numbered men, get ready to battle the Bolton's army for control of the North. They have a plan to make up for their lack of men, but that goes away once Ramsay releases Jon's youngest ""brother"" Rickon and has him run across the battlefield, while he shoots arrows at him. Jon makes it feet away from Rickon, right before an arrow hits and kills him. Enraged, Jon attacks the whole army, and his men follow. The battle is fierce, but it seems Ramsay has led Jon into a trap. Right when hope is lost, Sansa comes in with the Knights of the Vale and smash Ramsay's forces. Jon follows a fleeing Ramsay to Winterfell, and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Ramsay. The battle is won, and once again Starks rule Winterfell. 

\- While Dany has been gone, Tyrion has ruled Meereen in her place. He's a good ruler, but not as threatening as ""the mother of dragons"". So finally, all the slavers from Slaver's Bay begin an assault on Meereen. Just then, Dany and Drogon arrive and ready for battle. With a newly freed Rhaegal and Viserion, Dany and her three dragons begin burning the Slaver's fleet. They quickly begin retreating, but a message must be sent, so Dany has 2/3 of the former high-masters executed, and tells the third to spread the tale of what happened here. Of what happened when slavery tried to return to Meereen. 

* *Begin a new chapter, stronger than ever.*

\- With the battle won the North is safe, and a Stark once again holds the North and Winterfell. Now they must figure out what's next. A lot of powerful, northern houses have been hurt in the constant warfare, and someone needs to lead. Lyanna Mormont, the new leader of House Mormont, stands and makes a case for Jon Snow. Although he's a Snow, he's still a Stark, and for the most part a Stark has always ruled the North. This fact, and Jon's proven merit, sway the other lords in attendance, and soon chants of ""the White Wolf"" and ""King of the North"" are shouted by almost everyone. Jon hesitantly, accepts the honor, out of duty and not for personal glory. A new chapter begins, and from a bastard to King of the North! 

\- Now that the slavers have been put down, ships and soldiers are plentiful, and the dragons are battle-ready, Dany is ready to set sail for Westeros. She has three dragons, and Unsullied army, a Dothraki horde, and alliances with both House Tyrell and Martell, two old and respected houses in Westeros. A new chapter begins, one that finally has Dany in Westeros!

**Season 7:**

* *Plan for the future.*

\- Now as King of the North, Jon has more responsibility than ever. But the biggest threat is still that beyond the Wall, the WWs. Jon begins planning his tactics, one of which is convincing those in Westeros that the threat is even real.

\- Now in Westeros, Dany plans to fight for the Iron Throne, and the Lannisters are her target. With all her strength at the ready, she and her advisers plan for war. 

* *End of similarities (mostly), because the meeting is here!*

\- Dany is advised to invite Jon to Dragonstone, as he is gaining quite a reputation. 

\- Jon agrees and he and Davos make the journey. 

\- Jon arrives, and Ice and Fire are officially united!!!!!!!!!! 

\- Instantly the contrasts in styles are on full display. Jon is relaxed and focused on the bigger threat (Ice), while 

Dany is aggressive and more power-hungry (Fire).

\- Both at some point in the season go into battle, and each put themselves on the front-line. 

Over the course of the rest of the season, their bond grows stronger. And finally, in the season finale, they hook up for the first time. This sets the stage for a wedding, and maybe even a child in Season 8?

That's all! A lot of info, but after seeing all their similarities it seems very much like Jon and Dany are the embodiment of Ice and Fire. I'm not sure how the book will deal with the Azor Ahai prophecy, but it seems like the show is simplifying it, and making Jon and Dany each a half of the prophecy. It works! And who knows, this could all be right. Or completely wrong. Just my interpretation of the material. Thanks for the read! ",13,56,False,spoiler,,,,,

Okay so heres my theory for the finale or at least what I think would be a great ending. 
1. Jon is somehow not totally dead. So he and Danny are going to team up and fight the white walkers. Danny kills most of them with her dragons (epic fight between the ice dragons leaves only Drogon alive) Jon goes to fight the night king. The night king stabs him in the heart, but somehow Jon stays alive. But how? Because hes already dead. He then proceeds to kill the Night King. 
Danny kills Cersei. 
2. Danny lets Jon know she is pregnant with his baby. 
3. Danny is all set to take the thrown bc in the battle the Lannisters we destroyed except for Tyrion. 
4. Sam jumps in and claims that Jon is the rightful king and the people agree. 
5. Jon (as always) begrudgingly accepts. 
6. Danny mad with rage and power-hungry decides to kill Jon. 
7. She publicly attacks John with Drogon. 
8. John fights back but just as he is about to kill her, he remembers that she is pregnant and cant do it 
9. She stabs him in the heart with little fingers knife which is given to her as a baby gift. 
10. This does kill John. And she orders Drogon to burn is body. 
11. After the flames die down a sword is found to have replaced the knife. 
12. The sword is Lightbringer
13. Then the narrator tell us that everyone had the Azor Ahai prophecy wrong. They thought the it meant that a great warrior be a hero for men but it actually foretold the warrior that would end Westeros. The light brought was the fire of dragons. 
14. Danny goes onto to become a mad queen who destroys Westeros and all the characters we know and love in her quest for power and her version of justice. She became know as the worst ruler ever. 
15. After the tragic tale ends, a very old Tyrion Lannister is seen dictating this story to a young scribe. He lives across the narrow sea now. He briefly describes to the scribe how he escaped  one night from Kings Landing and from Dannys reign. 
16. And some way, either a young man comes to Tyrions home or he goes in another room where this man is...in some way we (the audience) find out that not only did he escape but he also took something with him . . . Jon and Dannys son. His name is Aegon or Eddard or something significant and heartbreaking for the audience. 

As a side note: I think it would be interesting for Cersei to find out Danny is pregnant and give her some ominous warning about what mothers will do to protect their children and make a better world for them. She would then be killed. But this warning settles into Dannys mind and becomes part of her logic when she takes action against Jon and Westeros.

I apologize if Im ignorant and this is something people with gout suffer from but...

If hes in a special chair, is skipping events, and generally doesnt leave his palace because his spoiled ass is sitting around stuffing his face with liver, that TOTALLY changes my view of him and his death.

I had always assumed it was an injury or disability.

Do they say this in the show and I missed it?  Im confused because usually this show would make it a point to highlight this.  Like a scene with him grossly tearing into a big juicy steak while telling others to exercise more control.

Im only about half way through ASOS so I may be jumping the gun but Ive seen the show twice so no worries about spoiling it for me.

Him being more of a glutton rather than an unlucky soul like Tyrian totally changes the plot around him for me.

The series has always been about one simple premise: the parallels of life (what must exist) and death (what threatens the balance, magic), each one represented by a character. Each one a parallel of the other.

Lets start with Daenerys.
Life: fire.
The core of her story and character has always resolved around her as a mother, a life giver. The matriarch. The one to kill death with dragons.
Her obstacle: She faced death (magic) and lose her purpose as the life character (birth).

Then theres Jon.
Death: ice.
The core of his character resolves around the white walkers threat. He becomes the leader to fight the coming of death.
His obstacle: He died, then came back to life using the same magic hes trying to defeat.

- Shes the representation of the hope of life.
- Hes the good-guys representation of death.

So, Life and Deaths destinies meet and we have a child: the union between life and death, ice and fire, into a new being. The key to everything.

The last time the representations of life (Azor Ahai) and death (Nissa) created something, was a power (Lightbringer) able to defeat the while walkers.

The twist: the white walkers ultimate goal has always been to stop/kill D&amp;Js baby. They knew from the start this being would exist in the future, and that it represents the power to defeat them all, somehow.

The series has had these 3 stories (Jons, Danys and the WW/NKs) advancing since the beginning to meet at this point.

So... the infamous bittersweet ending may have 2 scenarios:
- The baby is sacrificed to end it all (unlikely).
- Jon must take deaths side and they wont ever be together (because theres only what must exist and death must cease to exist in this world) and Dany and the baby are safe. (Likely).


PD: Im not a native english-speaker, nor have I read the books (just theories) and its also my first time posting here, so gods please have mercy!

Like for me, The Red Wedding is the saddest and most emotional moment in the Series, and of course it's unsettling, but I mean unsettling in a way that you look away. And in the Red Wedding I couldn't look away.

So moments, that even felt a bit unnecessary, but also really unsettling?

As I'm thinking of it and watching White Walker scenes, most people think the White Walkers and the Wights (the people that the WW's raise from the death) often have the same objective. But I find it very interesting that the primary instinct of the wights are to kill the first living thing they see ahead of them, no matter where they are or who is with them. While I can't recall the White Walkers ever solely going for a kill, if they do it's because there's an agressor (or threat). Otherwise they aren't actually as aggressive themselves as I and probably most people assume on first sight. It's like were getting lead on the wrong foot by thinking the White Walkers have this killer instinct while actually if you watch the scenes objectively they really don't (in the scenes that we see in the show).

Could there be a deeper meaning to this behavior and maybe including a major plot twist as to why the White Walkers are heading south? PS: I could be completely wrong based on the books, idk.",14,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

After discovering she's pregnant, the cut to her returning and declaring an alliance. 

So what did Tyrion promise her?

Well, if you go back a few episodes, Tyrion and Dany have a heated conversation about concession, since the witch prophesied that she could not bare children.

My theory is that he promised that if Dany won, they would take her child and raise it to be the heir to the throne. It makes sense that Cersi would agree to this, as she knows her army (as it stands) can't defeat Dany's, as well as gives her a chance to both look like the hero while also planning what she imagines is the perfect betrayal; Euron returns with the Gold Company and together, she believes they would have the strength to defeat either what remains of Jon and Dany's forces, or to battle the Night King and  defend Kings Landing.

Which is also why Tyrion has such a look of dread when Dany and Jon hook-up. While he was sure he could talk Dany into raising a Lannister as her own and leaving the kingdom to that child, he's less sure he could convince Jon if a bond between the two was formed. Furthermore, on the off chance Dany could get preggers, a child born of the two of them would have a significantly greater claim to the thrown than a bastard Lannister.

My stance: Lord Rickard Stark knew and allowed the marriage between Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. 

My Reason: Why wouldn't he? 

The whole idea that Lyanna defied her father and ran away with Rhaegar, or allowed herself to be kidnapped, thus inciting a war and getting her and Rhaegar's family killed, just doesnt seem right to me. 

The North is all about Honor and respect and the value of family, everything Lyanna did (at face value) speaks the opposite of that. Why would a true born, northern woman, daughter of the Warden of the North, defy the very foundations of the Northern beliefs and morales? For a man she didnt know ?? (Because if she was the KOTLT -Knight of the Laughing Tree \*see Tourney of Harrenhall for further details- she would have only come face to face with Rhaegar for an extremely short period of time ONCE and then left the tourney and didnt see him again until the night she vanished.)

Lets review the events that led to the night of her departure with Rhaegar.

Whatever happens at the Tourney, Happens. Strangely enough, Ashara Dayne -best friend to Elia Martell/Targaryen- danced with men who were either directly involved in the Rebellion or related to someone who was. She danced with Oberyn-Brother to Elia. With her own Brother, Arthur Dayne- siblings that had connections to the Tower of Joy (TOJ) as it was near THEIR home. She also danced with the boy who loved her, Ned Stark- brother to Lyanna. Jon Connington- man involved with King Aerys directly. And Berristan Selmy- another man in direct service to the King. 

I believe that she was indeed the KOTLT as the events surrounding THAT point at Lyanna being a knight in disguise for Honors sake! (let me just stop right there and point out how HONORABLE Lyanna was. She went to fight against men far more experienced and stronger than her and WINS to teach a lesson of honor. Now this is either tragically ironic, or has a meaning behind her actions. She went through all of that to teach them honor and then turns her back on her own beliefs just a year later for a guy she doesnt know?) 

Rhaegar, attending with his wife (Who may have just gotten pregnant with Aegon, see my birth timeline for details) is sent out to find this mystery knight and bring them back so that Aerys can execute the apparent Him. But Rhaegar does not find a man, he finds a young woman. Not just ANY woman, but Lyanna Stark -whether she said her name or Rhaegar knew this, or didn't know it at the time is yet to be determined. Rhaegar cannot allow her to be killed for MANY reasons, the foremost being that shes a Woman who was simply teaching a lesson to some knights. Impressed with her power, skills and sense of honor he of course lets her go.

Now it is said that Elia and Rhaegar WERE NOT IN LOVE and I cannot stress this point enough when talking about E+R. Plutonic love and caring for each other yes, but passionately in love, no. They were FORCED into marriage and had to deal with it the best way possible. (Thus the possibility that ending their union was mutual.)

It is Also rumored that this tourney was cover for a secret meeting between Rhaegar and some Lords and with that blown by the presence of King Aerys, Rhaegar is not sure who he can trust and what he can say. But in the privacy of their tent, Rhaegar tells his wife who the KOTLT really was; a young northern woman.  

Imagine them having a conversation along these lines.

After Rhaegar tells Elia what he found in the forest..

E: Who was she?

R: I dont know her name.

E: Then if you see her if you win the tourney, place the crown on her head.

R: Are you sure? As my wife I should crown You.

E: What use have I for a crown of roses when I was born with a Real crown?

I believe Elia was not petty enough to be upset if she was not given the crown of roses should Rhaegar win the tourney. She was born a REAL princess, to be a REAL queen. Why would a real princess worry about a fake crown at some tourney? She wouldnt, instead she allows Rhaegar to crown the mystery woman should he win to recognize this Lady Knight for her honor and strength. 

Rhaegar wins the Turney. When the moment comes to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, Rhaegar sees the girl as Lyanna and places it on her head. Elia realizes what she allowed him to do, so does Rhaegar, but they both agreed and stay true to their word and crown the woman who was the KOTLT. After that everyone leaves with a bit of tension on the matter.

Fast forward nine months to the birth of Aegon. Rhaegar, having not been able to bring all the lords together at Harrenhall, has done what other Princes failed to do by bringing Dorne into the royal family and having a son by their Princess Elia.

 Rhaegar was a BOOKWORM before he took up the sword and I believe his whole reason for doing everything he did was due to something HE READ. He also lived on Dragonstone so I wouldnt doubt that he possibly saw the same things Jon discovered in THAT CAVE and possibly even showed/told Elia (she was after all on his side and was smart and his wife). Rhaegar might have known all along that the Night King was coming but who the HECK WOULD BELIEVE HIM?! No one in power.....except maybe some Northerns who lived where the Night King would come from So Rhaegar has to do all of this without anyones knowledge except those he knew he could trust to be involved. 

But who could he trust? His wife and Ashara Dayne, his best friend Arthur Dayne and very few others.  

After Aegon is born Rhaegar KNOWS Elia will die if she has ONE MORE CHILD. Not wanting to leave his children motherless and force Elia to have another, they agree that he must seek a wife and third child else where. He really wants to bring his sigil to life and reincarnate Aegon/Rhaenys/Visenya, his two children where named Aegon and Rhaenys after all. This he believed would unite the kingdom behind him and break them away from Aerys so that Rhaegar could dispose of his insane father with the least amount of friction possible and then implant himself as king and prepare the lands for the Long Night. So he MUST have a third childperhaps some vision was sent to him through a certain red lady...

Somehow, Lyanna is brought up. Though Rhaegar will have to convince Lord Stark of breaking the engagement between Lyanna/Robert Ashara -involved with their plan- goes back to Dorne under the rumor that SHE is with child. No one objects to her returning homewhere she will then prepare the Tower of Joy for Rhaegars new wife and possibly Elia when she is well enough to travel.

I think she danced with the men at Harrenhall for information. Somehow her dance partners are involved with the choices Elia/Rhaegar and Ashara make at this point. 

Rhaegar leaves Dragonstone -where he was with his family. When Aerys imprisoned Elia in KL he had her brought there from DS- and goes across Westeros to find Lord Stark. Lyanna is not yet wed to Robert Baratheon (Side note, LYANNA HATED ROBERT. He was a father to a bastard ALREADY before they even wed and she looked down upon him. Of course she would take any chance to get out of her betrothal to him. Roberts father was her fathers friend and was long since dead.) While they were coming down from the north on the way to Riverrun for the wedding, they would have been traveling around Harrenhall. Camping out along the way and Brandon was someways ahead.

(Hold onto your tinfoil hats out there)

Rhaegar rode around with a handful of guards and finally found the Starks. I am convinced he spoke to Rickard Stark about the Long Night, something Rickard is extremely surprised about seeing that its mostly a Northern story and a southern Prince seems to know all about it and actually believes in it. Rhaegar somehow convinces Rickard to end the engagement with Robert Baratheon and wed Lyanna to him. But he is married? His wife is annulling the marriage as they speak so that she may return to Dorne and live a full life. She has done her duty as a royal wife and given him a son. Not to mention that Rhaegar knows Lyanna was the KOTLT at the Tourney of Harrenhall, (blackmail?). It was Rickard who arranged for Lyanna to marry Robert as Roberts father was dead by that time and Robert was still being fostered in the Eryie so Rickard has the power to end that engagement and make a new one.

Given Lyannas contempt of Robert and her emotional response towards Rhaegar, she makes him consider the marriage. After all, Rickard had southern ambitions. What better arrangement than for the first Stark to become Queen of Westeros? But that probably wasnt enough to make Rickard break the vow at firstso Rhaegar has one last moment to convince him and does so by telling him SOMETHING, maybe showing him something in flames? He says that he wishes to dethrone Aerys and team with the North?

Rhaegar convinces Rickard to let Lyanna go with him to Dorne and wed him and have his child there. Somehow, Lord Stark agrees. But this is not something that can be simply sent by raven to tell Robert about, its way too involved, elaborate and sensitive, so Stark allows Lyanna to go to Dorne with Rhaegar and commence with the plans all in secret. Robert wouldnt be able to retaliate because they would have already been wed by the time he found out and it couldnt be undone, all at the behest of the one who arranged it in the first place. Rickard would wait until After Brandon married Cat and he could personally tell Robert what happened and why.

There are those who think Lord Rickard did not agree, but Rhaegar would not kidnap Lyanna, that doesnt make sense. He was not his father. Lyanna could have run away, but both of them were too smart to ignore the repercussions of her simply abandoning her fathers arrangement to Robert and putting everyone in jeopardy by running away with the Prince. I doubt Rhaegar would have been ok with her turning her back on everyone and everything so the only logical explanation has to be that Lord Rickard Stark knew everything all along. Neither R nor L would have been dumb enough to not expect fall out after running away for no other reason than a summer fling. (Even if both were married, there are easier ways of sneaking around to see each other than running away.)

Why Lyanna at all? To secure the North. He had the South, Dorne, and was secure with a son. As I read somewhere, about some Targaryen, he married once for duty and once for love. Not only love but the North is what Rhaegar was after. In the event of dethroning Aerys he would have the ENTIRE support of the North AND the South! Through wives and children. To crush everything and everyone in-between who would have sided with Aerys. Rhaegar was covering all his bases so to speak, the North from where the Night King would come, and the south were he would eventually hide his family in the event of the Long Night.

But SOMEONE (through all of GRRM's details this one seems to be missing, who told Brandon? It may have relevance, it may not. But I want to know.) told Brandon THE LIE that Lyanna had been forcibly kidnapped by Rhaegar. He abandoned his wedding, which was stupid because he could have gone to KL with an ARMY behind him but no! He ran off with a handful of buddies to KL (King's Landing) and his noble and honorable ways got himself locked up due to his brash behavior. King Aerys was in KL, Rhaegar and his family would have been on Dragonstone. Aerys had no idea what Rhaegar had/has been up to and when Brandon comes in saying everything he does Aerys takes it as a threat. Since hes insane of course he doesnt believe anything anyone sayswe know what happened afterwards.

So why do I believe Rickard Stark agreed? Because GRRM, a stickler for the finest, smallest of details, didnt seem to mention Rickards actions and stance on the matter of his only betrothed daughter being allegedly Kidnapped by the very noticeable Prince who was- at face value- already married. Logically, Lord Stark should have been the one to inform his son that Lyanna was taken right out from under him. Lyanna would have been traveling with her father because no engaged noble Lady traveled without a guardian, father, brother or husband present. As far as we know, Lord Stark DID NOT tell Brandon what happened and DID NOT react to the ""abduction"" of Lyanna in any mentionable way. (Which is unusual for GRRM to neglect details as important as that as he does not neglect details by accident or laziness. I believe the lack of action on Lord Stark's part might mean something after all.)

Rickard apparently didnt do ANYTHING until Aerys told him to come to KL. Now lets take into account how long it took Brandon to actually get to KL, roughly a short week riding alone as it was mentioned later that it took Tywin two weeks (a fortnight) to get to KL from Casterly Rock -which is at the other side of the continent- with an entire provisioned army in tow. In the span of the time it took Brandon to get there, no one mentions how angry Lord Stark was at Rhaegar for running off with Lyanna. If we go by what is told, it appears Lord Stark didnt even know his son had ridden to KL or that his daughter -who was traveling with him- had been kidnapped at all. 

If Lyanna had truly been taken without Rickards consent, it seems that it would make sense if he expressed anger and did something about it. But why isn't Rickard's reaction or feelings about it mentioned? He would have been with her at the time, yet the lack of his reaction, and the focus on only Brandon's, seems strange. It's like they heard two versions of same event. Why doesn't Rickard gather his sons and go to war? Or they might have even ridden after the Prince himself, he was hard to miss. Lyanna was good at disguise?  (GRRM could have done a lot with those events, he could have elaborated but he is telling us details without telling us anything at all. )

The very lack of mentioning of Lord Stark doing anything in Lyannas defense speaks volumes to me -Very clearly- that Lord Stark was somehow involved with R+L running off. Had Brandon NOT been misinformed of her disappearance, R+L could have married/procreated in the TOJ (Tower of Joy) in Dorne, Brandon/Cat could have married, Robert would have been out of luck. A war would have come, but if Rhaegar had his way not until Elia was well enough to travel  home without suspicion. (In other words, it would be a totally different story but what shaped the line of events is missing pieces)

But someone lies to Brandon and in the span of nearly two weeks since then, he gets himself and his father killed. Rickard cannot tell Aerys the truth as the truth is extremely dangerous. Either Rickard was an idiot or he was involved, his actions speak that. He knows the truth of R+L but cant say it because Aerys wouldnt believe it anyways. In the accounts of what happened in King's Landing that day, Rickard doesnt even bring up the subject of Lyanna, he only speaks in Brandons defense. Why?? Because he knew where and why R+L ran off to and under what circumstances they did. 

The Starks are killed and it would have been another few days for Ned/Robert/Jon Arryn to receive word about it all. Nearly two to three weeks after Lyannas disappearance is when Robert finally hears about anything! AND it was Jon Arryn who started the fighting by attacking Gull Town and refusing to give up Robert/Ned.  

Now there is Always the possibility that R+L truly did run away, that Rickard sent the message to Brandon about it. But that does not explain why Rickard -according to the books or even anywhere in the show as far as I know and could find- did not go with Brandon to KL for Lyanna, he did not inform Winterfell or Ned/Robert of the events happening, he did not raise alarm the very moment he would have known she was gone against his wishes. He did seemingly nothing at all about anything except Brandon in KL. Again, either GRRM made Rickard a completely idiot or he knew something. knowledge of R+L. Knowing GRRM like we do its most likely he had Rickard in on the entire arrangement the whole time. But the twist came in Brandons brash reaction and the lie someone told him about R+L.

But someone lies to Brandon and in the span of nearly two weeks since then, he gets himself and his father killed. Rickard cannot tell Aerys the truth as the truth is extremely dangerous. Either Rickard was an idiot or he was involved, his actions speak that. He knows the truth of R+L but cant say it because Aerys wouldnt believe it anyways. In the accounts of what happened in King's Landing that day, Rickard doesnt even bring up the subject of Lyanna, he only speaks in Brandons defense. Why?? Because he knew where and why R+L ran off to and under what circumstances they did.

The Starks are killed and it would have been another few days for Ned/Robert/Jon Arryn to receive word about it all. Nearly two to three weeks after Lyannas disappearance is when Robert finally hears about anything! AND it was Jon Arryn who started the fighting by attacking Gull Town and refusing to give up Robert/Ned.

Now there is Always the possibility that R+L truly did run away, that Rickard sent the message to Brandon about it. But that does not explain why Rickard -according to the books or even anywhere in the show as far as I know and could find- did not go with Brandon to KL for Lyanna, he did not inform Winterfell or Ned/Robert of the events happening, he did not raise alarm the very moment he would have known she was gone against his wishes. He did seemingly nothing at all about anything except Brandon in KL. Again, either GRRM made Rickard a completely idiot or he knew something. knowledge of R+L. Knowing GRRM like we do its most likely he had Rickard in on the entire arrangement the whole time.

My stance: Lord Rickard Stark knew and allowed the marriage between Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.

My Reason: Why wouldn't he?

The whole idea that Lyanna defied her father and ran away with Rhaegar, or allowed herself to be kidnapped, thus inciting a war and getting her and Rhaegar's family killed, just doesnt seem right to me.

The North is all about Honor and respect and the value of family, everything Lyanna did (at face value) speaks the opposite of that. Why would a true born, northern woman, daughter of the Warden of the North, defy the very foundations of the Northern beliefs and morales? For a man she didnt know ?? (Because if she was the KOTLT -Knight of the Laughing Tree \*see Tourney of Harrenhall for further details- she would have only come face to face with Rhaegar for an extremely short period of time ONCE and then left the tourney and didnt see him again until the night she vanished.)

Lets review the events that led to the night of her departure with Rhaegar.

Whatever happens at the Tourney, Happens. Strangely enough, Ashara Dayne -best friend to Elia Martell/Targaryen- danced with men who were either directly involved in the Rebellion or related to someone who was. She danced with Oberyn-Brother to Elia. With her own Brother, Arthur Dayne- siblings that had connections to the Tower of Joy (TOJ) as it was near THEIR home. She also danced with the boy who loved her, Ned Stark- brother to Lyanna. Jon Connington- man involved with King Aerys directly. And Berristan Selmy- another man in direct service to the King.

I believe that she was indeed the KOTLT as the events surrounding THAT point at Lyanna being a knight in disguise for Honors sake! (let me just stop right there and point out how HONORABLE Lyanna was. She went to fight against men far more experienced and stronger than her and WINS to teach a lesson of honor. Now this is either tragically ironic, or has a meaning behind her actions. She went through all of that to teach them honor and then turns her back on her own beliefs just a year later for a guy she doesnt know?)

Rhaegar, attending with his wife (Who may have just gotten pregnant with Aegon, see my birth timeline for details) is sent out to find this mystery knight and bring them back so that Aerys can execute the apparent Him. But Rhaegar does not find a man, he finds a young woman. Not just ANY woman, but Lyanna Stark -whether she said her name or Rhaegar knew this, or didn't know it at the time is yet to be determined. Rhaegar cannot allow her to be killed for MANY reasons, the foremost being that shes a Woman who was simply teaching a lesson to some knights. Impressed with her power, skills and sense of honor he of course lets her go.

Now it is said that Elia and Rhaegar WERE NOT IN LOVE and I cannot stress this point enough when talking about E+R. Plutonic love and caring for each other yes, but passionately in love, no. They were FORCED into marriage and had to deal with it the best way possible. (Thus the possibility that ending their union was mutual.)

It is Also rumored that this tourney was cover for a secret meeting between Rhaegar and some Lords and with that blown by the presence of King Aerys, Rhaegar is not sure who he can trust and what he can say. But in the privacy of their tent, Rhaegar tells his wife who the KOTLT really was; a young northern woman.

Imagine them having a conversation along these lines.

After Rhaegar tells Elia what he found in the forest..

E: Who was she?

R: I dont know her name.

E: Then if you see her if you win the tourney, place the crown on her head.

R: Are you sure? As my wife I should crown You.

E: What use have I for a crown of roses when I was born with a Real crown?

I believe Elia was not petty enough to be upset if she was not given the crown of roses should Rhaegar win the tourney. She was born a REAL princess, to be a REAL queen. Why would a real princess worry about a fake crown at some tourney? She wouldnt, instead she allows Rhaegar to crown the mystery woman should he win to recognize this Lady Knight for her honor and strength.

Rhaegar wins the Turney. When the moment comes to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, Rhaegar sees the girl as Lyanna and places it on her head. Elia realizes what she allowed him to do, so does Rhaegar, but they both agreed and stay true to their word and crown the woman who was the KOTLT. After that everyone leaves with a bit of tension on the matter.

Fast forward nine months to the birth of Aegon. Rhaegar, having not been able to bring all the lords together at Harrenhall, has done what other Princes failed to do by bringing Dorne into the royal family and having a son by their Princess Elia.

Rhaegar was a BOOKWORM before he took up the sword and I believe his whole reason for doing everything he did was due to something HE READ. He also lived on Dragonstone so I wouldnt doubt that he possibly saw the same things Jon discovered in THAT CAVE and possibly even showed/told Elia (she was after all on his side and was smart and his wife). Rhaegar might have known all along that the Night King was coming but who the HECK WOULD BELIEVE HIM?! No one in power.....except maybe some Northerns who lived where the Night King would come from So Rhaegar has to do all of this without anyones knowledge except those he knew he could trust to be involved.

But who could he trust? His wife and Ashara Dayne, his best friend Arthur Dayne and very few others.

After Aegon is born Rhaegar KNOWS Elia will die if she has ONE MORE CHILD. Not wanting to leave his children motherless and force Elia to have another, they agree that he must seek a wife and third child else where. He really wants to bring his sigil to life and reincarnate Aegon/Rhaenys/Visenya, his two children where named Aegon and Rhaenys after all. This he believed would unite the kingdom behind him and break them away from Aerys so that Rhaegar could dispose of his insane father with the least amount of friction possible and then implant himself as king and prepare the lands for the Long Night. So he MUST have a third childperhaps some vision was sent to him through a certain red lady...

Somehow, Lyanna is brought up. Though Rhaegar will have to convince Lord Stark of breaking the engagement between Lyanna/Robert Ashara -involved with their plan- goes back to Dorne under the rumor that SHE is with child. No one objects to her returning homewhere she will then prepare the Tower of Joy for Rhaegars new wife and possibly Elia when she is well enough to travel.

I think she danced with the men at Harrenhall for information. Somehow her dance partners are involved with the choices Elia/Rhaegar and Ashara make at this point.

Rhaegar leaves Dragonstone -where he was with his family. When Aerys imprisoned Elia in KL he had her brought there from DS- and goes across Westeros to find Lord Stark. Lyanna is not yet wed to Robert Baratheon (Side note, LYANNA HATED ROBERT. He was a father to a bastard ALREADY before they even wed and she looked down upon him. Of course she would take any chance to get out of her betrothal to him. Roberts father was her fathers friend and was long since dead.) While they were coming down from the north on the way to Riverrun for the wedding, they would have been traveling around Harrenhall. Camping out along the way and Brandon was someways ahead.

(Hold onto your tinfoil hats out there)

Rhaegar rode around with a handful of guards and finally found the Starks. I am convinced he spoke to Rickard Stark about the Long Night, something Rickard is extremely surprised about seeing that its mostly a Northern story and a southern Prince seems to know all about it and actually believes in it. Rhaegar somehow convinces Rickard to end the engagement with Robert Baratheon and wed Lyanna to him. But he is married? His wife is annulling the marriage as they speak so that she may return to Dorne and live a full life. She has done her duty as a royal wife and given him a son. Not to mention that Rhaegar knows Lyanna was the KOTLT at the Tourney of Harrenhall, (blackmail?). It was Rickard who arranged for Lyanna to marry Robert as Roberts father was dead by that time and Robert was still being fostered in the Eryie so Rickard has the power to end that engagement and make a new one.

Given Lyannas contempt of Robert and her emotional response towards Rhaegar, she makes him consider the marriage. After all, Rickard had southern ambitions. What better arrangement than for the first Stark to become Queen of Westeros? But that probably wasnt enough to make Rickard break the vow at firstso Rhaegar has one last moment to convince him and does so by telling him SOMETHING, maybe showing him something in flames? He says that he wishes to dethrone Aerys and team with the North?

Rhaegar convinces Rickard to let Lyanna go with him to Dorne and wed him and have his child there. Somehow, Lord Stark agrees. But this is not something that can be simply sent by raven to tell Robert about, its way too involved, elaborate and sensitive, so Stark allows Lyanna to go to Dorne with Rhaegar and commence with the plans all in secret. Robert wouldnt be able to retaliate because they would have already been wed by the time he found out and it couldnt be undone, all at the behest of the one who arranged it in the first place. Rickard would wait until After Brandon married Cat and he could personally tell Robert what happened and why.

There are those who think Lord Rickard did not agree, but Rhaegar would not kidnap Lyanna, that doesnt make sense. He was not his father. Lyanna could have run away, but both of them were too smart to ignore the repercussions of her simply abandoning her fathers arrangement to Robert and putting everyone in jeopardy by running away with the Prince. I doubt Rhaegar would have been ok with her turning her back on everyone and everything so the only logical explanation has to be that Lord Rickard Stark knew everything all along. Neither R nor L would have been dumb enough to not expect fall out after running away for no other reason than a summer fling. (Even if both were married, there are easier ways of sneaking around to see each other than running away.)

Why Lyanna at all? To secure the North. He had the South, Dorne, and was secure with a son. As I read somewhere, about some Targaryen, he married once for duty and once for love. Not only love but the North is what Rhaegar was after. In the event of dethroning Aerys he would have the ENTIRE support of the North AND the South! Through wives and children. To crush everything and everyone in-between who would have sided with Aerys. Rhaegar was covering all his bases so to speak, the North from where the Night King would come, and the south were he would eventually hide his family in the event of the Long Night.

But SOMEONE (through all of GRRM's details this one seems to be missing, who told Brandon? It may have relevance, it may not. But I want to know.) told Brandon THE LIE that Lyanna had been forcibly kidnapped by Rhaegar. He abandoned his wedding, which was stupid because he could have gone to KL with an ARMY behind him but no! He ran off with a handful of buddies to KL (King's Landing) and his noble and honorable ways got himself locked up due to his brash behavior. King Aerys was in KL, Rhaegar and his family would have been on Dragonstone. Aerys had no idea what Rhaegar had/has been up to and when Brandon comes in saying everything he does Aerys takes it as a threat. Since hes insane of course he doesnt believe anything anyone sayswe know what happened afterwards.

So why do I believe Rickard Stark agreed? Because GRRM, a stickler for the finest, smallest of details, didnt seem to mention Rickards actions and stance on the matter of his only betrothed daughter being allegedly Kidnapped by the very noticeable Prince who was- at face value- already married. Logically, Lord Stark should have been the one to inform his son that Lyanna was taken right out from under him. Lyanna would have been traveling with her father because no engaged noble Lady traveled without a guardian, father, brother or husband present. As far as we know, Lord Stark DID NOT tell Brandon what happened and DID NOT react to the ""abduction"" of Lyanna in any mentionable way. (Which is unusual for GRRM to neglect details as important as that as he does not neglect details by accident or laziness. I believe the lack of action on Lord Stark's part might mean something after all.)

Rickard apparently didnt do ANYTHING until Aerys told him to come to KL. Now lets take into account how long it took Brandon to actually get to KL, roughly a short week riding alone as it was mentioned later that it took Tywin two weeks (a fortnight) to get to KL from Casterly Rock -which is at the other side of the continent- with an entire provisioned army in tow. In the span of the time it took Brandon to get there, no one mentions how angry Lord Stark was at Rhaegar for running off with Lyanna. If we go by what is told, it appears Lord Stark didnt even know his son had ridden to KL or that his daughter -who was traveling with him- had been kidnapped at all.

If Lyanna had truly been taken without Rickards consent, it seems that it would make sense if he expressed anger and did something about it. But why isn't Rickard's reaction or feelings about it mentioned? He would have been with her at the time, yet the lack of his reaction, and the focus on only Brandon's, seems strange. It's like they heard two versions of same event. Why doesn't Rickard gather his sons and go to war? Or they might have even ridden after the Prince himself, he was hard to miss. Lyanna was good at disguise?  (GRRM could have done a lot with those events, he could have elaborated but he is telling us details without telling us anything at all. )

The very lack of mentioning of Lord Stark doing anything in Lyannas defense speaks volumes to me -Very clearly- that Lord Stark was somehow involved with R+L running off. Had Brandon NOT been misinformed of her disappearance, R+L could have married/procreated in the TOJ (Tower of Joy) in Dorne, Brandon/Cat could have married, Robert would have been out of luck. A war would have come, but if Rhaegar had his way not until Elia was well enough to travel  home without suspicion. (In other words, it would be a totally different story but what shaped the line of events is missing pieces)

But someone lies to Brandon and in the span of nearly two weeks since then, he gets himself and his father killed. Rickard cannot tell Aerys the truth as the truth is extremely dangerous.

In the accounts of what happened in King's Landing that day, Rickard doesnt even bring up the subject of Lyanna, he only speaks in Brandons defense. Why?? Because he knew where and why R+L ran off to and under what circumstances they did.

The Starks are killed and it would have been another few days for Ned/Robert/Jon Arryn to receive word about it all. Nearly two to three weeks after Lyannas disappearance is when Robert finally hears about anything! AND it was Jon Arryn who started the fighting by attacking Gull Town and refusing to give up Robert/Ned.

Now there is Always the possibility that R+L truly did run away, that Rickard sent the message to Brandon about it. But that does not explain why Rickard -according to the books or even anywhere in the show as far as I know and could find- did not go with Brandon to KL for Lyanna, he did not inform Winterfell or Ned/Robert of the events happening, he did not raise alarm the very moment he would have known she was gone against his wishes. He did seemingly nothing at all about anything except Brandon in KL. Again, either GRRM made Rickard a completely idiot or he knew something. knowledge of R+L. Knowing GRRM like we do its most likely he had Rickard in on the entire arrangement the whole time. But the twist came in Brandons brash reaction and the lie someone told him about R+L.",9,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

The excuse for not killing the men stranded on the rock or Dany when she comes to their rescue is ""plot armor"". You would think after 7 seasons there would be a little more patience for things that don't make sense at first. 

So far, only Targaryens ride dragons, correct? Plus Drogon had already formed a bond with Dany allowing her to ride him so perhaps the NK chose Vicerion (sp) by design. Remember we don't know his motive yet or if he's pure evil etc. He proved how strong and accurate he was with that ice spear so he could have taken down all of them. I also think his final throw was more of a warning toss as he's super magical and not one to miss.

I've always wondered... would this be Ramsay's play with any character he captured? Could any character be broken down to Reek?

I think it's notable that Ramsay initially frees Theon and learns his story, especially his internal identity conflict of Stark/Greyjoy and his guilt of killing and burning the farm boys and betraying Robb. He uses these bits of information while later breaking Theon down into Reek. Learning of Theon's internal conflict and emotional weakness may have inspired Ramsay to torture and manipulate him instead of flaying him alive and killing him.

Characters that come to my mind are Jon, Jorah, Sandor, Jamie, Dany, Arya, and Cersei. Maybe that kind of brutality is impossible to withstand, but I just have a hard time seeing these characters sink to that level - especially Sandor and Cersei. These characters are simply too stubborn and tough to submit to ""Reek"". At the very least, they would take their first chance to kill him.

**Question: Would Ramsay torture and break down any character into Reek? Could Jon, Jorah, Sandor, Jamie, Dany, Arya, or Cersie become Reek?**

Cersei points out that she has the most powerful armada , but Tycho says that it's Euron's armada and that he's loyal as long as it suits him.

That brings me to the question if Euron will at some point betray Cersei? 

We know that his original plan was to seduce Daenerys and when that didn't work he went for Cersei. So Cersei is obviously the second choice here. 

He also wants the most beautiful woman in the world and let's face it's not Cersei. 

It might just be me , but Euron looked impressed by Dany and her dragons in the dragon pit . 

As Tycho said , Euron is loyal for now. He is not a honourable guy and everything he does he does for himself.

I'm personally not a fan of Euron betraying Cersei because it contributes little to the story and Cersei should be the final human villain. 
But taking into consideration what we know about Euron , it is a possibility that he will move against Cersei.

What do you think , will Euron betray Cersei?

So I'll start with my 3 favorite episodes.

*3. ""Kissed by Fire,"" Season 3, ep. 5*
I couldn't tell you what else goes on in this episode, but the scene where Jaime explains why he killed the Mad King is some of the best acting I've ever seen, and the scene was incredibly powerful. It also was really the beginning of Jaime's character arc into a ""good guy.""

*2. ""Hardhome,"" Season 5, ep. 8*
This episode was incredible cinematography. When Jon's sword hit the Whitewalker's blade and the reverberating sound happened. When Jon and the Night King stared each other down. Wew lad. It gave me chills.

""1. ""Battle of the Bastards,"" Season 6, ep. 9.*
Where do I even start? The battle was incredible. Plus the picture of Jon drawing his sword with the cavalry charging him is my screensaver. One of the best images in modern cinematography. Tormund biting out throats. Wun Wun tearing people in half. Knights of the Vale cutting through the Bolton army like butter. Ramsay getting his face broken by Jon. Sansa releasing Ramsay's own dogs on him. Probably the best hour of cinematography ever. 

So... what are your favorites?

3. Jaime Lannister (+ his right hand)

Jaime was already well-respected by the people of Westeros as a legendary fighter and with that hell of a fight he had with Ned Stark and his men, he definitely in my top three. The reason he isn't any higher is because...well, you'll see.

Shame about the hand though.

1 upvote = 1 prayer for Jaime's hand.

cAn wE hiT 3 uPvOtEs iF wE dO i'LL kiLL cErSEi lol jK i wOn'T oWo



2. Oberyn Martell (The Red Viper)

Oh, Oberyn, where do I start? Well, you can evidently see his fighting prowess in that fight against Gregor Clegane (geddit? see- okay too soon), what with all that spinning and such. He's also the proud wearer of half a maester's chain, his specialisation being poisons, a weapon never to be underestimated, especially in Westeros, what with all the delightful weddings and such. 

Personally, to me, Oberyn is a fighter who's not only great with a spear or a sword, like some of the other rival fighters in the realm, he's smart as well, though sometimes a little...cocky.



and finallyyyyy, drumroll please......



1. Arya Stark

Okay don't scream at me in the comments but I really think Arya is one of the few who truly understand combat, as not some contest of brute strength (ahem ahem Gregor) or merely a battle of slow but delicate strikes. 

She balances between the two, light on her feet when in a fight, dodging swings while counterattacking swiftly, making up for her somewhat small stature with her speed.

Her fight with Brienne is a great example of her skill, and given that she either won/drew (depending on how you look at it), that's something nobody would have foreseen.

That she would beat Brienne of Tarth, who bested both the Hound and Loras Tyrell (though not without some difficulty). 

That she would beat Brienne of Tarth, a member of Renly Baratheon's Rainbow Guard.

That she would beat Brienne of Tarth, who has trained her whole life to become a warrior.

Arya has a headstrong, determined character, but even so she does not let this determination blind her in combat. To call it combat would be underselling it.

She learnt to dance the water-dance, just as Syrio Forel, who taught her all those years ago in King's Landing, did. She lived up to the true legacy, became what she always wanted to become.

And perhaps between all the battles and poisonings, between the chewed throats and crushed eyeballs, maybe that really is the beauty of Game of Thrones.

I come from the thought that the prophecy and history isnt accurate after 8,000 years of re-telling and instead of like fate its a fulfillment of the prophecy through following the way the AA defeated the Others because its the only way to defeat them

Azor Ahai is a legendary figure in the faith of R'hllor, the Lord of Light. Thousands of years ago, he forged the sword Lightbringer which he used to defeat the darkness of the Great Other. This came at a price, however, as in order to unleash the sword's true powers he had to plunge it into the heart of his loving wife, Nissa Nissa. A prophecy foretells that he will be reborn as The Prince That Was Promised.[1]- Fandom wiki 

Theories 
- Jon Snow will get the Azor Ahai reborn label by the end of the series 
- The original AA- The problem with the swords was how to get a sword to defeat the dead come back / The Others which lead to the conclusion of how to work dragon glass into swords and it was trial and error. First he uses steal and its no good, then he realizes it needs to be dragon glass etc. 
- The things he plunged his sword into were killed/ dead/ re animated by the knight king / the Others / White walkers whatever they were called back then to stop them. And that the living heart line is a red herring or a miss tell throughout   History and had to be plunged through a dead/ living heart which is why its been tolled wrong because the complexity of the line isnt remembered correctly. The person is dead and controlled by the Others so its talking about a reanimating that he kills 
- Jon uses his Targaryen magic to awaken dragons from Stone of winter fell - this is just something I think because of all the talks about his heritage and the crypts that fits into the prophecy of waking dragon from stone 
- Danny dies in battle and becomes reanimated and Jon Snow once theyve figured out dragon glass swords has to kill her and defeats the Others.
- I think throughout the show weve seen Jon / Sam figuring out about dragon glass killing the Others while the old AA had to be the original maker and it took him forever I think with Sams help itll happen faster 
-but not in time to save Danny or winterfell. And instead of the knights king going down to Kings landing and destroying it , its Danny. 

So basically getting the glass to not break and in sword and arrows form in mass will save them as it did in the past but at a cost as its to late to save those who already died 
- and the reason the children of the forest dont have / know this weaponry in the first men / AA didnt trust them as they too found out the children of the forest created the Others in the first place 


Anyway all this was just floating in my head and Ive written it out like word vomit

Mace: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense of course.

Tycho: Im glad we see eye to eye on that matter.

Mace: Did you know that Maegor the Third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest everyone charging interest and cut off both their hands.

Tycho: Most unfortunate for the glovers.

Mace: If a man charges no interest on a loan, then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why chance it? Whereas the compromise of reward makes a man willing to gamble.

Tycho: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

Mace: You are the worlds best gamblers, and all those bets you won built this. (motions towards Iron Bank building)

The conversation itself shows that Mace has a good knowledge of history and finances, but the last line is really what gets me. Mace Tyrell might be somewhat eccentric and even docile, but it would take someone with a keen intellect to throw out that observation into a conversation out of nowhere, especially when it could work in his favor when negotiating the crowns debt.

If you paid attention to the Summer/Winter cycles in the GOT world we may assume that the planet is orbiting it's sun on a ecliptical orbit but 6 times slower than Earth . This causes the longer summers and winters on the planet. In the books and series so far we saw mentions of only 4 major continents Essos, Westeros, Sothoryos and Ulthos, but haven't seen even a glimpse of what lies on the other side of the Known world. So i can speculate that their planet enters a phase in which the dark side of the world now turns against the sun so the white walkers who resides on the other side must invade the light side in order to survive. So i also assume that on the other side of the Known worlds lies the realm of the walkers with their own kingdoms.

I propose that a force small enough to be defeated by the Fray' (though caught unawares and oblivious to Fray betrayal/slaughter, as was I) with a force no larger than that of Stannis' at Blackwater",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/94zgvn/1game_of_thrones_original_posits_the_number_of/,edenaviv789,1533543053,"1. [continued] ... (before and after Wildfire the number difference is significant.  Neither the Starks alone nor Stannis alone (as was the case) could conquer King's Landing.  I propose that the only possible path leading towards victory involves a Stark offer to Stannis' after the death of Renly. The offer consists simply of the restoration of the deal implemented by Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark, which ended in the first season/book, but now with Robert's brother Stannis instead now.
Just go back to the way things were before Ned died.  
    This possibly renders the Fray actions inconsequential if alternately instead Starks pass through the Twins' fray unharmed, instead Starks attacking King's Landing and losing after Stannis lost, facing the same troops that Stannis faced at the end of Blackwater Bay battle, defeated by Tywin Lannister Casterly Rock troops along with the soldiers iniitially involved in the defense of the city.  Rob Stark would have lost in King's Landing regardless.  With the same amount of troops of Stannis post- wildfire, climbing walls and storming the castle. Perhaps the Stark master war strategist along with intimate knowledge of King's Landing tunnels, (with the wildfire stunt already used and unreapatable), would Rob Stark defeat Lannisters?  Nobody knows...
        I posit that a Stark-Stannis team up would have almost guaranteed defeat of Lannisters, definitely the best odds of victory (Rob bends a knee?),  Starks would have otherwise done this with Renly, had demon-baby not been born.  This proposal looks at a battle around the time of Blackwater Bay pitting Starks and Stannis' militaries combining forces versus Kings' Landing defense forces
during that battle.  The show hints at this possible outcome with Renly's forces joining Stark, as well as the possibility of Lady Stark's plea for brotherly peace. 
  For simplicities sake, let's say Stannis and Stark teamed up after Renly's death.  Assuming Stannis would take the good deal proposed by Stark, beneficial and acceptable for both sides, if he's at all practical, assuming he chooses the advice of Onion Knight smuggler over Crazy Red Lady, (who really had her grips in him at this point).  Stannis ruling with the King in the North having autonomy up there. 
     This unfolds later as a better defense versus whitewalkers, with Stannis learning of the army of the dead and then all Westeros troops sent to the Wall to fight whitewalkers. What happens at Dragonstone with Khalleesi  dealing with Stannis in control? I feel that she wouldn't bother the North, them having integrity and all and love of their people, she'd leave them be.  She wouldn't to Stannis, so Starks are honorbound to fight her. [Late Chaotic unorganized Beethoven rough beast Damien writings or ramblings] Before that though, Munce raider takes Castle Black before running into Stannis' troops south of the wall, after wreaking havoc on the upper North. Then John maybe dies and no knowledge of whitewalkers believed by anyone, knowledge dying with theWatchers on the Wall if John Snow doesn't survive...Munce respects him, idk (it's a messier less clean posited alternate reality, the original writing seemed cleaner.) 

2.  Tyrion's honest truthful explanation during his trial of actions and convincing  of deeply held love for Shea: ""Come on babe, I love you still more than anyone ever. As a man a few weeks said to you, you will die if you stay here , by that man! (Mistrial!) I was saving your life, never touched Sanza. What really happenend Shea?  (Probably wouldn't have mattered even if it happened). She don't care about royalty and titles, just love.

3.  On societal qualified leaders seeking World Influence and Power, such as Eddard Stark fighting for the throne instead of Robert.  The outcome is a King ruling Westeros from love of citizens, not ruling through fear and lies, manipulation and force.  The best possible leader for the people gaining and holding Power thus does occur.  Out of duty for the best World if he rules, he opposingly to his nature ruthlessly and through trickery and manipulation gains the Iron Throne, then rules it unharmed as he rules the North, with well earned respect of the people.  Uniting opposites is the solution to most issues/problems I've contemplated.  Through self mastery and temperance , powerful polaric forces are integrated into one cohesive whole in man with a heart of gold, aware of all possible potentials of himself and man, able to control at will any possible human response, no matter how polarized, and wisely choosing when to masterfully appropriately apply any facet of human behavior. This is a king!  This involves Ned playing the Game of Thrones and winning, his soldiers more loyal than those fighting for those they do not love.  In foresight looking at possible future outcomes, he chooses that his rule would benefit people most in all of Westeros.  This action against his own nature benefits others most, him being of a broad potential, knowing the importance of his victory at all costs, avoiding other potentialities had other less quality rulers won instead.

But who would be better suited for ruling over the seven kingdoms?

Well, first off, I just want to make one thing clear, I'm not against any of these characters and I have loved and enjoyed watching both of them grow. I've seen them make good decisions and I've also seen them make bad decisions. 

Also this will include things from the books and the TV show. I dont want to make this too long, so there's plenty of things and subjects that add on to each point. 

***Now, the way I seen JS and DT is as follows:***

* Jon is not self-appointed, or self-entitled. He wants to unite people, he wants to bring peace and he is forging alliances, not forcing them. He is willing to fight on the battlefield instead of making other people do it for him. He is respected, not feared. He is someone the people can follow. What makes the people on his side is his promise of peace, his promise of unity and his ability to lead. He looks like a leader, someone they can follow, and not someone who rules over them. He is not a tyrant. I also think that Jon knows how to follow, Dany does not.
* Dany is self entitled, she feels like she rule because she is the ""rightful heir."" She also wants to bring peace, she is forging alliances, but she is also trying to force them as well. She doesn't fight on the battle filed the same way as Jon does, mainly because she doesn't know how to and she would probably die in an instant. Instead what she does is uses her powerful armies and dragons to accomplish things, which isn't her fault I suppose. to me, she looks more like someone who wants power for the wrong reasons.

One of the main differences between Jon and Dany is the fact that she tells people she should be the queen, Jon on the other hand has other people basically telling him that he should be king. This shows that people view Jon as a king, who not only would make a good king, but someone who the people can trust. 

The conversation between Varys and Kevan Lannister, talking about the difference between Tommen and Aegon, also sort of fits the difference between Daenerys and Jon:

Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.

Daenerys isnt a good queen, for the same reason that Robert wasnt - she doesnt recognise that its a duty rather than a right.

***To answer this question though I do believe JS is better suited for the job.***

He saved thousands of people, managed to find lands for them to settle on and food to feed them. He knows how to unite people for a common cause, and aims for a long term peace that will benefit everyone. Jon is fair and compassionate, yet can still be assertive and just when he needs to. Most importantly, he can see the big picture and is never out for himself.

Dany on the other hand has good intentions, but her decisions are often short-sighted. She wants to abolish slavery, yet has no idea how to replace such a well established system. She has caused plenty of deaths and destructions that could have been avoided in the first place. She wants the throne because she believes its hers by right, not because she wants the people in Westeros to have a better life. And she has no prospects of how to rule the Seven Kingdoms once she has taken it. Dany has a reputation of being a bad ruler, and on the show it has only been improved with the help of Tyrion. 

She barely cares of the consequences of her acts , because in her mind shes always fair and just and thus has no long-termed vision. She didnt think of an alternative economic system when she ended slavery. Tyrion did it for her. She apparently believes its a great idea to bring an army of rapist on Westeros, but once again she didnt think of the possible negative consequences. She wants her damned crown and that is the only thing that matters.

***Daenerys' Issues that makes her a bad candidate.***

Unlike her father Dany is not an evil person, shes a good hearted woman with a big sense of Justice. However she clearly lacks of ruling skills. She doesnt have the patience nor the humility, she just has the army and a very clever adviser but I wouldnt call that a personal quality.

* Shes too pride to admit her mistakes or her familys mistakes. she kept blaming everthing on the Usurpers dog, until Tyrion shut her mouth. She starts to listen though ( at least on the TV show)
* She barely cares of the consequences of her acts , because in her mind shes always fair and just and thus has no long-termed vision. She didnt think of an alternative economic system when she ended slavery. Tyrion did it for her. She apparently believes its a great idea to bring an army of rapist on Westeros, but once again she didnt think of the possible negative consequences. She wants her damned crown and that is the only thing that matters.
* Whether a ruler controls his region through honour, respect or fear those decisions they make must be firm as well as consistent. Stannis is not a man who could inspire men to him nor charm his way to power, but those who do follow him respect him because of his unflinching ways. He hands out punishment and reward in the measure warranted by the action of those under him. And when he commits to something he does not shirk from it, regardless of how tasteless it might be. Daenerys's sense of justice has not been so strict, but more to her own personal whims. When angered she tortured the wine sellers family, but then when challenged by the harpies she refused to kill her hostages. While this may have been the ethically right thing to do it has made her look weak in the eyes of her enemies and in some of her commanders. A ruler who is not firm will rule an uneasy kingdom.

As mentioned previously, I see a parallel between her story and King Roberts. Robert Baratheon was an outstanding warrior, a conqueror, the Khal Drogo of Westeros like Jorah Mormont said, but in the end he revealed himself a terrible king. Fortunately Jon Arryn was here to save his ass, the same way Tyrion is here to save hers. Thats the point of Danys character. Unlike Jon, she wasnt meant to lead or be a good and wise leader, she was meant to conquer with fire and blood.

***Final thoughts!***

Jon has done everything Daenerys had done but better in my opinion. He didn't have 3 huge dragons, he didn't have a huge powerful army like she did. She fell in love with Jon because she has seen first hand that there is someone out there who is just better than her. She even didn't think she deserved Jon's loyalty we he finally bent the knee.

I dont mean to offend anyone so these opinions are only my opinions. I kind of feel bad about nitpicking such a great show, but oh well lets do it. 

(7th) Season 7

Man, that loot train battle was amazing. The battle at sea where Euron attacks Danys armada was pretty awesome as well. There were some spectacular moments in Season 7, but overall it just didnt feel like Thrones to me. The pacing was jarringly off and the decision to grab a white walker to convince Cersei to join the real war didnt make much sense in the believability of the story or the believability of the characters who made that decision. The Arya/Sansa tension seemed unnecessary (and again unbelievable), and Littlefingers death was an anticlimactic end to such a clever character arc. It also seems (unbelievable) that he would have not seen it coming. Also the scene where all the main characters were walking together in Episode 7 was pretty cheesy, as was Jon calling Dany Dany out of nowhere.

(6th) Season 5

I honestly love Season 5. Ive gotten weird looks for saying that, but I do. It may not be the most eventful season, but its a season of adventure. Arya travels to Bravos to join the faceless men, something Ive been wanting to happen since Season 2. Tyrion travels all the way across Essos. We get to see Volantis for the first time. We get to see Valyria and some all-out stone men. Also, Hardhome. Thats all I need to say about that. A lot actually changes in Season 5. The main reason I have it this far back is because the pace slows down a lot from Seasons 1-4 and it doesnt seem believable to me that Baelish would think wedding Sansa to Ramsay would be advantageous to Sansa or himself in the long run. On top of all that, it becomes apparent in Episode 1 that Daenerys is yet again going to spend another full season in Essos. Watching while being aware of that takes away a lot of the surprise.

(5th) Season 6

Season 6 is bright when it dazzles and dull at all other times. If I rated this season based on Episodes 9 and 10 alone, it would get first place. Battle of the Bastards was spectacular and the beginning sequence to The Winds of Winter was so creepy and melancholic that it seemed like its own little show inside of Thrones. The revelation of Hodors backstory and how it fits in with the present was one of the few things that actually surprised me from the recent seasons, and I thought it was great. However, Season 6 draws out many storylines that should have been wrapped up by the end of Season 5. This includes Arya spending a full season doing exactly what she did the prior season with no progress to show for it in the end, the High Sparrow story arc talking about mercy and justice for another season while barely anything changes within the city, and of course another season where we realize all too early that Dany is going to be in Essos all the way through again.

(4th) Season 3

Season 3 is good stuff, but I think it was overly hyped up at the time. The Red Wedding is probably the most infamous scene in all of Thrones. It caught me by complete surprise. It haunted me the next week after I watched it while I was walking to class or sitting in lectures. Thats why it was great, because it made all of us want to tear our hair out. Overall though, Season 3 wasnt too exciting throughout. Since its the first half of A Storm of Swords, it doesnt close up many subplots and there just arent a lot of notable things that happen. However, it shows Westeros in a different light then we see in Seasons 1 and 2. We get to meander through the torn up riverlands with Arya as she meets the Brotherhood, and also with Brienne and Jaime on their unfortunate travel situation back to Kings Landing. Those Brienne/Jaime scenes were a very strong highlight of the season, seeing the two polar opposites slowly form a bond and hearing Jaimes account of what really happened all those years ago with his sword and the kings back. Also Jon and Ygritte have cave sex and Danys mastermind decision making where she leaves Astapor with her dragons AND her army is badass.

(3rd) Season 2

Season 2 is classic Thrones; the political intrigue, the adventures of main characters through uncharted lands, the ominous mysteries of comets and birds with too many eyes, the War of the Five Kings. We get to explore north of the Wall for the first time. We get to meet the crazy red-haired lady and learn of the Lord of Light. We get to see Arya begin her journey as the free soul that she is. We get to see Tyrion manipulate manipulators and cut beards off of old people. We get to see baby dragons and the beginning of the best romance of the show (Jon and Ygritte). The crazy thing is, Season 2 might actually be less exiting than Seasons 6 or 7 in the big scope of things. Not too much happens in the first half of the season, but once the Nightman murders Renly and the first of the five kings dies, everything becomes more intriguing. Even in the first few episodes though, the pace is quick and we get to learn more about the world these characters are living in. I didnt enjoy Qarth very much, but nonetheless this was a solid season through and through.

(2nd) Season 1

Ah Season 1. Probably the most underrated season of them all. Its easy to get further on in any series and claim the beginning as old news, but I think a lot of people forget how truly amazing this season is. Watching the first few episodes again is a great experience, seeing all these main characters together as the story begins. These episodes also deftly manage introducing the immensity of characters and Westerosi history with ease. And when we saw Ned Stark get beheaded we found out we were truly watching something unlike anything weve seen before.

(1st) Season 4

Season 4. Damn. What a thriller. Joffrey dies in Episode 2?? I mean give me some time to breathe at least. Even before that we get to see the best character intro out of the entire series, Oberyn. And then Tyrion walks in, sees him pull his dagger out of another mans wrist, and then watches as Oberyn starts making out with his main chick. This season shines with glory. There is a sense of urgency throughout that comes from the fact that the capital is loaded with people from all over the Seven Kingdoms. At first because of the royal wedding, but then because of Tyrions incarceration. The entire trial sequence was nothing short of amazing and brilliantly showed the inner workings of Kings Landing. Of course theres Episode 9 which proved itself entirely fulfilling and cemented itself as the best battle up until that point. And then everything ends with a bang. Lysa Arryn. Oberyn and The Mountain. Tywin and Shae. Damn. 

Thats all! Dont know why I decided to do this. Just felt inspired.",16,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if Jon was a twin and before Ned Stark got to the tower where Lyanna gave birth maybe has twin was born first and inherited their fathers genes of the Targenan ; the white hair, purple eyes. And Lyanna knew that Ned couldn't pass that child as his so she sent that child away, but Jon having darker hair and eyes meant that Ned could raise his as his own child 

This would mean that Jon would be the song of ice and his twin the song of fire 

If this was to happen then Jon could stay King in the North and his Twin ( been the first born of the two) could sit on the iron throne 

(I know this won't be true but think about it would that make a bit of sense)

I didn't include anything for S1 on purpose, as marketing material for the brand new show probably had different release schedule. If someone is aware of official poster / teaser / trailer that was released before any of the dates that I have, please let me know so I could adjust accordingly.

Assuming early Apr'19 release date, we might see the first poster in September / October, first teaser in November / December (possibly Thanksgiving on November 22?), and the first official trailer in February (SuperBowl 53 falls on February 3, probably the best timing).

* Jon's mom died in childbirth
* Tyrion's mom died in childbirth
* Danaerys' mom died in childbirth

Notice a pattern? Is there any mother still alive in the show (aside from Cersei)? Mothers don't fare well in Game of Thrones, they either die in childbirth (see above) or are doomed to watch their children die and suffer (Catelyn, Cersei, Olenna, Elaria).

I'm pretty sure Danaerys will die giving birth to a child, just in line with one of the common themes.

What really concinced me of this idea is the prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur:

&gt;When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. **When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.**

This also matches the [vision Dany has in the House of the Undying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VuGknEfQY), where she almost reaches the iron throne, but instead goes north and (symbolically) goes into the afterlife.

Bravvos is also the home of the ""Faceless Men"", and the ""Faceless God"".  As the ""Faceless God"" is yet to be tested, we really don't know how powerful he is(for all we know, he's more powerful than the Targaryans, Dragons, Starks, Children of the Forest, or Night King... or maybe he is one or multiple of them).

I've watched probably 40+ hours of youtube videos about this series, and watched the first 7 seasons twice. 


I've yet to see much on the history of Braavos.  Wondering if there is some history in the books people could share.  


I just have this feeling that Season 8 will have a lot to do with Bravvos, despite most people on youtube seemingly ignoring it(except for Arya's connection).  I mean, Braavos is arguably more powerful than the 7 kingdoms, after all, the 7 kingdoms are in massive debt to Braavos.  

Does Braavos have any history, of being rich, or conquering the world?  Why are they so powerful, yet don't don't to conquer people.  Braavos has always been one of the most interesting aspects of GOT to me, if only because they're so mysterious, powerful, and important to the story.

The New season promises to show us the Age of Heroes, the true origin of the White Walkers, and the mysteries of the far East. These three mysteries have been the subject of many fan theories and I am excited to delve into this part of the Game of Thrones Universe. However, thanks to the AWOIAF, we already know much of what will happen.

GRRM is amazing at twists, obfuscating the truth from his readers. AWOIAF is no exception. There are many stories of the Long Night, from different cultures, different lands, and different times. Weve worked and tried to reconcile this seemingly conflicting information, some going as far so to blame GRRMs poor sense of scale. Indeed, it seems something is amiss, as in the show we have been shown the origin of the White Walkers.

Or have we? We have seen the creation of one White Walker, the Night King. Bran assumes the children created them and Leaf confirms they did it to fight man. What no one says is that this is the first time this has happened.

There are many stories of Long Nights and the simplest answer is not that there was one big event with many different interpretations. This explanation doesnt work with the information were given AWOIAF, with events ranging from beginning of time with the GEOTD to stories Old Nan is able to recollect. The simplest answer is that there have been many long nights, many instances of White Walkers getting out of control all over Planetos.

My speculative tinfoil is in the original long night that killed the GEOTD, walkers spread everywhere, including Westeros. At the time the GEOTD existed in Westeros as well (as an explanation for the black greasy stone artifacts in Westeros). Theres some sort of trade/ sacrifice that causes the walkers to go dormant. Also its possible the Starks have a relation to the GEOTD, just like Dany does, although again, speculative. After all in the Age of Heroes, men lived much longer, just as the Emperors of the GEOTD lived for thousands of years. 

My apologies if this theory is already out there. I follow the subreddits closely and havent seen anything.",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been trying to figure out in general, what the two sides of the fight are, and this is what I came up with.

There are two sides.  

Those who believe in the Old Gods(The Weirwood Trees, that have underground root networks, spanning thousands of miles across westeros, allowing instant communication across westeros).  

And, those who believe in the New Gods(The Seven Septims, which are in reality powerless, and fake, but the Maesters use KNOWLEDGE, instead of DIVINITY, to communicate across westeros, using Ravens).

Before the religion of the Seven Septims came, before the long night, there were two main sides.  Those who protected the weirwoods, and harnessed their power(the Children, Giants), and those who wanted to cut them down, and destroy them(the First Men).

Eventually, once the First Men learned WHY the Children revered the Trees(because they are magical), the First men, and Children of Forest made a pact, to agree to BOTH worship, revere, and protect the Weirwoods.  Weirwoods were put in nearly every single major castle in westeros(or, minimally structures made with Weirwood).  In keeping weirwood trees at the far corners of Westeros, it allowed the thousands of miles of underground weirwood roots to continue to exist(despite there being less weirwood trees overall).

The long night occured, and the pact was made where the First Men agreed to respect, and worship weirwoods, in return for peace, the religion of the Seven Septims arrived shortly after.  The Seven Septim religion  went on to create the Citadel, and the Maesters.  The Maesters HATED the Old Gods, and Weirwoods, because they were ACTUAL magic, whereas the Maesters' 7 gods were largely powerless, and made up.  Because the Maesters weren't the most knowledgeable about the Old Magic, and they strove to be the most knowledgeable people in Westeros, they considered it ""false knowledge"", to maintain their positions as the smartest men in Westeros.

The Maesters couldn't use the Weirwood network to communicate instantly across westeros, like the users of the Magic of the Old Gods could.  So, they started using Ravens, to ""compete"" with the magic of the old Gods.  And soon, just like how there was a Weirwood tree in every major Castle, there was also a Maester, and a Raven in every major castle.

There are two opposing powers in GOT.  Two opposing means of communication. 

 The Weirwoods,  Starks, Children of Men, Night King all use the magic of the Old Gods(the Weirwood trees), and they often use the communicate, and manipulate events.

And the other side is the Citadel, the Maesters, the 7 Septims, and the ravens which they use to communicate, or manipulate events.

You may say that ""Meh, communication isn't important"".  But, people who study history realize that one of the ONLY reason great empires like the Romans were able to survive, was due to their impressive highways, and ability to use birds to send messages.

I think in the end, this battle in GOT isn't a battle of Good vs Evil(as has been said by many people close to the show).  It's a battle of two forms of society.  One that is ruled by false 7 gods, science, Ravens, and the Maester.  And another that is ruled by the true, merciless old gods, mysticism, and Weirwood Trees.

I think that the Maesters may be the main enemy of those who use the old Gods(like the Night King, Children of Men, and Starks).  

I think that families like the Lannisters(who neglect the old Gods, which is symbolized by the Dying Weirwood tree at Casterly Rock) are also a key in all of this. 

The Maesters, and Lannisters, and those who completely disavowed the Old Gods, are going to be attacked, and be opposed by the Magical Families/People(like Starks, Targaryens, Children of Men, Weirwoods). 

I think the Story of GOT is a story of the Old Gods, Versus the New Gods.  And, what we're seeing now is the Old Gods rising up, and coming to destroy the Maesters(who have been trying to destory the Old Gods, and Magic), and those who forsook the old Gods(like the Lannisters, who currently rule the 7 kingdoms).

I think that the Night King used the Weirwood network to see the future, and saw that the Starks were falling, and if the Starks fell, with the Lannisters ruling Kings landing, the Old Gods(weirwoods) may have been permanently defeated.

Wondering what people think.

They talk about the building of the Wall, and how there have been nearly 1,000 Commanders of the Nights Watch. That the Wall was built thousands of years ago. Meanwhile, it seems as if the same general lifestyle has been lived the entire time - fiefdoms and kingdoms, with few people that can read or write, constant skirmishes, no electricity, plumbing, etc. 

Meanwhile, Earth has moved from the Middle Ages (approx. 500-1500 CE) to the modern age of cars, trains, air travel, space travel, WiFi, cell phones, central air, plumbing, etc. in a span of just 500 years or so. 

Why did the world of Game of Thrones stop evolving? Why did technology stop improving? Is it the presence of magic? Or dragons? Did the Maesters and pyromancers just get completely overwhelmed by the fact that a large, flying, fire-breathing creature could undo entire cities in a single day?

He dies again Season 6 Ep 9. 

He dies a 3rd time Season 7 Ep 6. 

In Mothers Mercy we see Jon get stabbed to death by members of the nights watch and unlike Beric Dondarrion whom presumably needed to be resurrected immediately following his death fighting The Hound; we know that Jon wasnt raised from the dead for hours after he dies. How? Because it was night time when he was killed and then he was discovered by Davos in the early morning stiff as ice. Did the Red Woman who clearly stated she doesnt have necromancer powers actually raise him from the dead or did he just wake up? All of which goes into the mystery of the Starks as being possibly immortal beings. 
In The Battle of The Bastards we see Jon clearly get crushed and it can be speculated that he was suffocated in the rush of men trampling him. Beyond the idea that he wouldve been asphyxiated he obviously wouldve had broken rids, sternum etc or internal organ damage from this event. All of which are no afflictions to him since he walks away from the battle to bash Ramseys face in. 
In Beyond the Wall Jon gets tackled into the icy lake and for no fucking reason whatsoever is able to just climb out, ice cold, soaking wet in what in fan theories claim was the area known as the lands of always winter (freezing unforgivable cold) ;was able to ride a horse back and the very next scene with him, hes alive and pinked up, not even sick. 

My theory is that Jon Snow has died 3 times already and that this immortality will be revealed in Season 8. Basically put together all the fan theories about the Starks in the crypts of Winterfell needing Iron swords to keep them dead and the 13th commander histories &amp; lore and you get where Im driving at. Melisandre didnt raise Jon from the dead because he cant die. Hes immortal to a point of being beheaded or burnt alive.

**season 6 Episode 4:**     

***Dothraki Dialogue:*** **""**Ma jinne, ajjin, **Ei khal fin thir nakhaan okke sen dothrakhqoy aloji qisi mae mavijazeri athdinar mae, Vosma anha vos khal Anha okkak ei yeri"".**     

*English dialogue:* ""And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages youll raid, how many girls youll get to fuck, how many horses youll demand in tribute.You are small men. Under you, you can't lead dothraki people.""     

**season 6 Episode 6:**       

***Dothraki Dialogue: ""*****Ei khal fin thir nakhaan okke sen dothrakhqoy aloji qisi mae mavijazeri athdinar mae. Vosma anha vos khal, Anha vo vokkak sen dothrakhqoy. Anha okkak ei yeri"".**      

 *English dialogue:* Every khal who ever lived chose three bloodriders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal.I will not choose three bloodriders. I choose you all.        

Of course Emilia screwed it in Episode 6x04, and that's what she was supposed to say instead.       

***Dothraki Dialogue***: **Ma jinne, ajjin, fin vaese zhokwa jerie Khali Vezhveni? Fin vaesish vemrasoe yeri, finsanney nayat vil ahilee yeri, finsanney hrazef aqaffi yeri kazhi. Yeri mahrazhi zhikwi. Torga yeri, Vos at yeroa venoe idrilat mora vosecchi.**

At the very beginning of the series, White Walkers were believed to be extinct - even a myth. In the minds of the majority... if they even existed.. they were defeated over 8,000 years ago. It became apparent that the white walkers were busy at work over the past 8 millenniums... amassing an undead army.

Unbeknownst to the rest of Westeros... life was business as usual. All the filth in the world are selfishly making their way to the top - killing off anyone good or worthy in their journey towards power. The game of thrones as we like to call it.  

Before everything is said and done... I believe the heroes will somehow pull it together and defeat the White Walkers. However, I think it will come at a cost. I believe the majority of main characters will die in some heroic or shocking fashion - with the exception of Sansa Stark, Jon Snow and/or Daenerys Targaryen.

Bittersweet, we lost a lot of our favorite characters... but all is right is Westeros. The White Walkers are dead. All the bad guys are dead (Cersei Lannister, etc..). And the true, and noble heir to the throne, Jon Snow, will finally sit on the iron throne and unite the kingdom under peace. 

What a great ending (think when Aragorn get crowned in LOTR and the credits roll).  

However, I think Sansa will be consumed with envy and rage - and somehow poisons or murders the last of our familiar faces (King Jon and/or Queen Deanerys).  

There were a lot of foreshadowing of Sansa desiring to be queen more than anything in the world. Season 1, she let Aryas friend get murdered and lied because she wanted to get married to Joffrey. She betrayed her father, Ned Stark, and testified against him as a traitor - he was executed. 

In season 7, Arya seems keen to Sansas evil nature. (I even thought she was gonna kill Sansa. But kills Little Finger instead).  

Sansa claims that she learned a lot from Cersei Lanniste. And just like Darth Vader fulfilled his destiny and turned to the dark side... I believe Sansa will \[turn into\] Cersei.  

I think she will murder her brother Jon, or whoever sits on the iron throne. It will have the same ominous tone as when Cersei took the throne.  She will finally have what she wants... but gave everything for it. Even her soul. 

She will be the last known face of the series. 

And the white walkers are defeated.

...or are they?  

I believe we will believe initially that they are truly defeated. But I think the final scene will be of an infant White Walker (Crasters sons) - Being all that remains of the white walkers. 

White walkers were believed to be defeated 8,000 years ago. Why should this be any different?  

The implications would be that that baby would be the new King of the White Walkers. And his new duty would be to amass a new army. (Should only take about another 8,000 years or so).  

Everything comes full circle. 

Series ends. 

In my mind... The game of thrones is an endless cycle. 

For example... 

For the next 8,000 years... people will battle their way to the iron throne. Jon Snow will be a legend. White Walkers will be a fairy tale.  

It will end with us going... wtf. Sansa is the new Cersei. Everyone else is dead. Heck - she is would get murdered soon prolly. The white walkers arent dead! This thing is gonna happen all over again in perpetuity! Will there ever be peace in Westeros?? My mind is blown.

Anyways.. that concludes my theory. I havent heard it anywhere before. If theres something similar, please share! 

Im just a base-level fan. I havent read the books. Ive only seen the show to completion 1 time through. And I havent watched since the finale of season 7... so my theory is a little rusty and I had to google most of those names! Haha. 

But I hope you enjoyed my theory, let me know what you think!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon Snow and his comrades have seen that white walkers can be killed/destroyed and are aware that slaying one causes the destruction of its subordinate wights. So why bother approach white walkers by trying to work through the countless wight? Why not go straight to them?

Jon is also gathering forces to fight this army of the dead but why waste all those people by effectively giving them to the Night King when he can get a small army to distract the wights while he leads a small team to sneak up on and confront the white walkers?

Dreams
		Wolf dreams  Bran wargs into Summer. Since SoS Bran has just wolf dreams. 
		Crow dreams
		dream #1 coma dream  3rd Bran POV chapter GoT, crow tries to teach Bran to fly. It shows him the known world and the Heart of Winter. It tells him fly or die (trying to save him?). Bran learn how to fly and the crow pokes him in the forehead (third eye).
		dream #2 Ned dream  last dream in the GoT, happened before Bran learns about his fathers death. The crow flew into Brans chamber and ask him to come with him. They went down to the crypts. Ned Stark was there, he was sad. They talked and it was something about Jon.
		dream #3 weirwood dream  2nd Bran POV chapter CoK. Bran dreams of the weirwood, that has a bloody eyes, calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth, and from its pale branches the three-eyed crow came flapping, pecking at his face and crying his name in a voice sharp as swords.
		dream #4 tower dream  2nd Bran POV chapter CoK. Bran prayes for dreamless night. Instead he dreams about the three-eyed crow. It tells him to fly or die! as it pecked at him.He wept and pleaded, but the crow had no pity. It put out first his left eye, then his right eye. When he was blind, it pecked his brow. The crow was pecking so long until it splited open his head, came through it, and came out on the other side all in bone and brain. But Bran could see again. He was climbing tower miles high, his fingers were slipping and nails scratching on the stone. His legs were hanging, dragging him down. He cried for help. He saw a lion who said The things I do for love and tossed him out of the window.
		Weirwood dreams:
		dream #1 tree dream  1st Bran POV chapter CoK, only mentioned. Bran says the tree calls to him.
		dream #2 weirwood dream  2nd Bran POV chapter CoK. Bran dreams of the weirwood, that has a bloody eyes, calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth, and from its pale branches the three-eyed crow came flapping, pecking at his face and crying his name in a voice sharp as swords
		Bran about dreams  5th Bran POV chapter CoK. Theres different kinds. Theres the wolf dreams, those arent so bad as the others. I run and hunt and kill squirrels. And theres dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly. Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too, calling my name. That frightens me. But the worst dreams are when I fall.
		.s

Jojen

Dreams
		Crow dreams
		dream #1 winged wolf  1st dream he speaks of, 4th Bran POV chapter CoK. He says he saw winged wolf bound to the earth with grey stone chains. The three-eyed crow was trying to pecked through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.
		dream #0 greywater fever  4th Bran POV chapter CoK. Jojen states that when he fell ill in a dream he met the three-eyed crow.  
		4th Bran POV chapter CoK: you are the winged wolf, Bran. I wasnt sure when we first came, but now I am. The crow sent us here to break your chains. 
B: is the crow at Greywater?
J: No. The crow is in the north. Beyond the Wall.
B: How can I break the chains, Jojen?
J: Open your eye.
B: They are open. Cant you see?
J: Two are open. Your have three. The crow gave you the third. But you will not open it. With two eyes you see my face. With three you could see my heart. 
		Greendreams
		dream #1 sea that comes  5th Bran POV chapter CoK. Jojen forsees Theons attack on Winterfell. 
		dream #2 crypts  5th Bran POV chapter CoK. Jojen sees Bran and Rickon in the crypts with all the dead kings and their stone wolves. He also sees fake Bran and Rickon being skinned by Reek (Ramsay Bolton). 
		1st Bran POV chapter SoS  Jojen has no greendreams. He knows they have to go noth Beyond the Wall for Bran to have a teacher. He says Brans chains are broken, he has his third eye open, but he still doesnt know how to fly. He says he is no greenseer, just a boy who has dreams. 
		1st Bran POV chapter DwD  Jojen states this is not the day I die, sister. Later in this chapter
M: Jojen, did your dream this? Who is he? What is he? What do we do now?
J: We go with the ranger. We have come too far to turn back, Meera. We would never make it back to the wall alive. We go with Brans monster, or we die. 
		
		S

Bloodraven
		Leaf calls Bloodraven Greenseer not The three-eyed crow. Leaf tells them He is waitng for you. Meera asks if she is going to bring them before the Crow. Leaf immediately answers the Greenseer. 2nd Bran POV chapter DwD.
		Bloodraven calls himself a crow, as a part of Nights Watch. Bran asks him if he is a three-eyed crow. He answers Acrow? Once, aye. Black of garb and black of blood. He states, that he was watching Bran with a thousand eyes and one. Obvious refer to him being a spy during his times as a Hand of a King. 
Also he consider himself to have thousand eyes and one. Not just three. 
Still, he wants to teach Bran to fly. Same as the crow. 
2nd Bran POV chapter DwD.
Later, we learn that what Bloodraven meant was to fly as warging into a raven. 3rd Bran POV chapter DwD. What did the crow meant? 
		Only Bran in his thoughts refers to Bloodraven as the three-eyed crow. In the same chapter it is said, the children call him Greenseer. Also again, children say he has a thousand eyes and one. 3rd Bran POV chapter DwD.
		Jojen states he had strangest dream and smiles. 2nd Bran POV chapter DwD. Later, he says his job was to bring him here and that his part is done. Again  he states that Bran is not the one who should be afraid. 3rd Bran POV chapter DwD.

Coldhands
		Meera asks who sent you? Who is the three-eyed crow?
He answers a friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will. The last greenseer. 1st Bran POV Chapter DwD. 
Seems like for him three-eyed crow is just a name, that Bran, Meera and Jojen gave to the Bloodraven. He states call him what you will. And says he was sent by a friend. He never admits he was sent by the crow itself.

What exactly was the point of riding nearly all his forces North? He shouldve battened down the hatches and better prepared the Nights Watch for the incoming invasion.  If he had stayed and started preparing the NW for the incoming invasion would it have made a difference in their numbers? Could he have more easily built a truce with the King Beyond the Wall? If he had done this and they allowed 10xs more Wildling refugees through the wall would the NW have become part of a larger northern force? It literally takes all the way to season 7 for everyone to be on board with the out of context situation the NK represents. All the great houses are done including the Starks. Theon cant father children and his uncle is most likely going to end up dead. No more Greyjoys. Jorah left bear island and Lyanna wouldnt have Mormont children. Bran presumably cannot father children and Arya/Sansa if they can, would not be Starks. The Lannisters will not have children unless Tyrion or Jamie decide too, unlikely. Robin in the Eerie is mentally disabled in some capacity and will unlikely father children. The Tyrells died with Loras. The Martels died with Tristane. No one will rule in the 7 kingdoms without heirs. The status quo is over. The chains are broken.  I wonder how differently it wouldve gone though if people had made better decisions early on. 


Theres so many what ifs for this show; each season has many what ifs; like season 1 what if Ned had just gone tf home on the many occasions he had the opportunity to leave? What if Sansa had pushed Joffery off the walkway? What if Jon had ridden south to join Rob? What if Rob had just kept his betrothal to the Freys? What if Catlin went back to Winterfell?

There were no posts showing why Cersei can maintain the Iron Throne just as easily as the others factions can, so i'm hoping to perhaps let some people see how and why she SHOULD be queen, my first ever post so forgive me. Let's begin!  


1. **Cersei has nothing to lose, and no where to retreat.**  
With Casterly Rock gone, as well as all the Lannister children; Cersei has nothing to lose, no possible weakness that could be exploited by her enemies. She would sooner let King's Landing blow up with her enemies inside, than surrender it. She is capable of using wildfire and playing every dirty trick in the book to secure her win.  

2. **Her enemies are fighting each other.**   
The Targaryens are moving to fight the White Walkers, Cersei's greatest threats are going to clash and lower their numbers, if the White Walkers win then it's game over for everyone, fine. But if the Targaryen's win; they are going to lose A LOT of soldiers to the undead, perhaps even another dragon. There are few allies left to call upon in Westeros, every life lost is going to seriously effect the concluding battle. 

3. **Cersei's allies are a force to be reckoned with.**  
Cersei has the iron fleet, which consists of a solid army, not to mention the Golden Company which consists of 10,000   
infantry, cavalry and war elephants. The Golden Company are known for never breaking a contract, so they can't be   
bought off. Not to mention the speculation about Euron Greyjoy acquiring the horn, though I can't use that as a reason           
since it has not been confirmed. We also have the Lannister army, a lot of people think the Lannister army was wiped out  
   when Danaerus showed up and burnt them all, though that was actually just the last 'part' of the Lannister army, the rest  
   went with the Tyrell gold which arrived safely in the city.

4. **The dragons are, frankly, overestimated.**  
We saw how easily one dragon went down, and we also saw how Bronn, who had never fired the Scorpion before, dealt   
some serious damage to the biggest dragon. Cersei has the resources and gold to produce as many scorpions as she   
she needs. I believe if Daenaerus tries to fight the Queen; her dragons may actually end up getting pretty screwed over  
by a barrage of scorpion fire.

5. **Cersei is one of the few who knows how to play the Game of Thrones.**  
She has sacrificed everything, her children, her lover. ""You win, or you die."" as she once said, Cersei will literally do   
ANYTHING to win, there is no loss too great to secure the victory.   


6. **Tyrion miiiiiight betray Danaerus.**   
Hear me out on this one, but remember when Tyrion watched the battle between Jaime and Danaerus? Did you see the   
look on his face as he watched his family, the Lannister soldiers get burnt alive? The look of shame, and the feeling of  
betrayal he had was too great to ignore. Lastly, don't forget the look on his face when he saw Jon enter Danaerus' room,  
the last time Tyrion spoke with Cersei there was a feeling like a wall (No pun intended) that was put up between the two  
finally came falling down, perhaps there was some off-screen conversation that we were not allowed to hear about. If   
   Tyrion does go to Cersei; he'll spill all information of her plans, numbers, everything that she has and will do.  


7. **Danaerus isn't much better than her father, or Cersei for that matter.**   
People hate Cersei for the things she's done, but is Danaerus really any better? She's under-gone some serious   
   changes since we first met her. The bright-coloured silk dress wearing girl now clads herself in black and red, and really  
   holds up the the saying of 'Fire and Blood', which was shown when she FORCED the Lannister soldiers to kneel, and   
   set the Tarly's on fire, which also made Tyrion show some doubt in Danaerus' rule. 

8. **George R.R Martin dislikes fairy tale endings.**  
The title pretty much speaks for itself, so many people want Jon and Dani to win the war, sit on the Iron Throne and let   
peace reign over Westeros, though of all my points; this is one the one I am most sure about. If there is one thing I am   
also very certain about, it is that the ending will likely prove that war solves nothing. As George realised in his time in the   
   services, the second part of this point contradicts my side of the discussion but I wanted to share it.   


9. **It's Game of Thrones!**   
A short point, but if there is one show that lets the faction everyone hates wins, it's Game of Thrones. It could be either   
the Night King or the Lannisters, but we're lucky to know this is a universe where plot armour doesn't exit.   


That's it! Thanks for reading, would like to know what you think. As stated earlier I try not to be biased.

Feel free to leave more than one name so we could debate some of the less obvious choices.  Im not going to consider the gender barrier that exists in Westeros.

My #1 pick would easily be Jon Snow.  Hes  been around enough highborn/lowborn to understand how they both think.  He is honorable but has likely learned how that often isnt a good thing.  He is a bit too progressive and that got him killed but is now better suited to know how to weigh that in a world that will soon desperately need to change.

For me Daenerys is well behind Jon in this camp even though shes still a great choice. I have less faith in her based on the fact that she is not very forward thinking and has done a very poor job of considering how different cultures will respond to the revolutionary changes that she makes.  She also thinks that the miracle that she performed of birthing dragons has entitled her to a crown and so she would be unlikely to step aside for the good of the realm.

Tywin Lannister would be in my top five.  He doesnt have any of the problems that D.T. and J.S. have with navet and politics.  Very pragmatic and savvy but has a major issue with his heartlessness and that his name trumps everything else to him.  Tyrion would easily be a better choice since he has all of Tywins good attributes and none of his bad traits.  Unfortunately he suffers from the fact that Westorosi are shitty people who would never accept him no matter what.

Sansa is one Im very much on the fence about.  She was the most naive character by far but she has been through the school of hard knocks which could eventually shape her into a capable leader of the people who has a better grasp on how commoners suffer.

Stannis would be a get shit done sort of king but has little empathy and his choice to force a foreign religion on people wouldnt go well at all. Especially since its a religion he seems completely uninterested in. Hes a very bitter pill  to swallow but still better than many of the people in power in Westeros.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I am currently rewatching game of thrones. I'm on season 3 and it is just as good as the first time I watched. The one thing I want to ask mainly relating to season two is, how do most people feel about Theon after the things he does? I mean sure he's a moron, but I can't help feeling sorry for the guy, he never really had any belonging in his life and he is fucked about by the place he should belong to when he returns. Can we really blame him for being so emotionally confused torn between two groups. He also raised a good point saying that he was always a prisoner to the Starks however well they treated him... Not saying this justifies some of his actions. I just don't think he's that bad and the maester of Winterfell I think agrees with me, as we see while Winterfell is under siege.

Hence, it is possible for mankind and white walkers to be in a (sexual) relationship. This perhaps somewhat supports theories surrounding Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa. Some theorise that Azor Ahai, in order to create his sword had to sacrifice Nissa Nissa, and that then she subsequently became a white walker. And that later, it was in-fact Ahai who became the 13th lord commander of the Nights Watch, only to see Nissa Nissa in her new form, and due to his love became the Nights King, and ruled the wall with her at his side. 

Therefore, if Jon Snow is in-fact Azor Ahai reborn, the same could happen again but with Dany, in a story that sees the white walker threat avoided (as Ahai did not kill the walkers but merely brokered peace) and him and Dany to reunite in a truly bittersweet ending. 

I perhaps have made too much from this, and relied on other, perhaps not solidified theories. However, I can see this as a plausible, and quite GRRM-esc ending. What are your thoughts on this?",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

What is duty to the feel of a newborn son in your arms?* -Aemon Targaryen


I believe this quote, spoken by Aemon to Jon in season 1 is foreshadowing of how Jon's character will end up. 


Let's define honor as obligation to a whole people. (Ex: Jon staying with the Nights Watch in season 1 is honorable because he has an obligation to defend the realm.)


And in this context, let's define love as an obligation to a specific person or peoples (Ex: Jon has love for Ned because Ned is his father.)
(Note: this can also mean obligation to self, like Littlefinger, who acts without honor for only selfish reasons.)


First, let's talk about ""honor"" in GoT. Honor is GoT is shown as hamartia, a fatal flaw. 


Ned is the biggest upholder of honor, he refuses to move from his rigid stances despite the fact that simple logic would get him much further. Even when Littlefinger offers him a plan seemingly in his own, as well as the seven kingdoms best interests, he denies on the grounds of honor. He also, quite stupidly, informs Cersi that he knows about Joffreys true parentage, effectively sealing his fate, again on the grounds of honor.


Robb is no different. He beheads Lord Karstark despite it effectively destroying his chances of winning the war, because he is honorable. Even when Cat, Talisa, and Edmure advise him to sweep it under the rug until they've won the war, he follows his father's rigid world view, eventually leading to his death. 


Now, Jon has always been a character that's seen as ""honorable"". He has a conversation with Stannis where Stannis seemingly compliments him for being as honorable as Ned, but when Jon accepts the compliment, Stannis says that honor is what got Ned killed.


The conversation with Aemon in season 1 implies that Aemon went through the same crisis Jon was going through at that time, abandon your duties in the Nights Watch and go help family (family represents ""love"" in this case), or be honorable. Aemon was honorable, and seems to regret it.


&gt;*I will not tell you to stay or go, you must make that choice yourself, and live with it the rest of your days, as I have.* -Aemon Targaryen 


When Aemon then asks what Jons father would do given the choice between duty and honor, Jon is purposely indecisive. 


&gt;*he would do what's right. No matter what.*


So what is *right*?


Well, Jon also obviously has a connection to love, as his very birth is a result of forgoing honor for love with Rhaegar and Lyanna. And likewise, it could be argued that Jon is forgoing honor for love by bending the knee to Dany(we'll have to wait to see how the northern lords react to this).


Honor is something all men should have, but love can cloud honor. So the first part of the quote makes sense if you apply ""the woman"" as Dany. And if Dany is pregnant by Jon like many hythosesize, that could be the newborn son part. 


With the coming conflict, it seems Jon will have to choose. The totality of his people (honor) or Dany, and his newborn son (love). 


&gt;*We all do our duty when theres no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet, sooner or later, there comes a time in every man's life when it is not easy. A day when he must choose* -Aemon Targaryem


When Jon's day comes, what will he choose?

as the text post says , i've managed to not see more than maybe, a couple of minutes here and there. i think i saw the first 20 minutes of the first EP when it started? Since then i've been sent scnes here and there by friends to be shown the differences between book and series (red wedding/purple wedding/the magical journeys of the hound and arya) I was swept up in Madmen and Parcs&amp;recs while also balancing my ""game of life"" so i never got into it.This wasn't a conscious choice in the sense that i disliked it, i always figured i would get into it, but then the seasons passed, i had a kid, moved, new job, et-al.

I got the first book about four monthd ago as a birthday gift from my friend who had one of the first editions. So i plowed through it, really liked. Got the second one, and am now plowing the last one with about fifteen pages to spare.

Now, to my question, i really like the books, and i am a big fan of Peter dinklage. And what I've been shown of the show seems really well acted and directed. So i was just wondering, should i dive into it headfirst? or will the divergences from the book throw me?

I am asking because i discussed this with a co.worker on a business trip this week, and she showed me the red wedding on her laptop. And i kept going ""who's that"" 
 and ""where is this person""? 

As for me, I am a huge tolkien fan, and it took me some time to reconciliate with the fact that the books and films have different merit and are good in different ways, so this is why i turn my question to the experts of this community.

Heroes:

Jaime (Dies saving Westeros)
Dany (Dies saving Drogon)
Pod (Dies saving Brienne)
The Hound (Dies saving Arya)
Theon (Dies saving Yara and killing Euron)
Melisandre (Dies bringing back someone who died - Jon again, or maybe Jaime)
Bran (Dies helping save Westeros, but wargs into Drogon before death)
Jorah (Dies trying to save Dany)
Arya (Dies saving Sansa)


Non-Hero Deaths:

Cersei (dies in wildfire and madness)
Euron (see above)
Cerseis unborn fetus
Tormund
Varys
Gendry
Beric
Davos
The Mountain
Qyburn
Tormund

I see Jon, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Brienne and Yara surviving.

The fall breaks them. Some are given the chance to climb, they refuse. They cling to the realm, or the gods, or love, illusion. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is. 

In all honesty here, Littlefinger played the Game of Thrones better than anyone. Any character you can think of who was murdered, probably could have been prevented if Littlefinger never existed. 

Ned, Catlyn, Rickon, Robb, Tywin, etc.
Baelish betrayed ned and Catlyn
causing Rickon to go into hiding.
Which caused Robb to rebel, leading to his death. He helped poison Joffrey which got Tyrion framed, ultimately leading to Tywins death.

In season 7, Baelish gave Bran the knife that was meant to kill him, saying that it started the war of the 5 kings. He was right. Adding on to that, he persuaded Lysa to kill Lord Arryn. If Lord Arryn never died, Robert never would have came to Winterfell, and Ned and the Starks never would have went to Kings Landing. Thus any major plot point you can think of was due to Lord Baelish.

Hear me out. Jon is already at Castle Black at the end of Season 3. In Season 4, yes, he went to Craster's Keep, but he was never surrounded. At Hardhome, what scene where he was ever \*surrounded\* by the wights or White Walkers? ""Surrounded"" be all around. Encircle. The only thing he was ever \*surrounded\* was the Battle of the Bastards, when the Boltons encircled them, and Beyond the Wall.

But what about the ""Climb"" episode? Yes, I know he was also referencing to the wildlings (at the time), because the next scene clearly showed it, but he was never encircled nor be all around, only with them walking &amp; climbing. If you just think about it, Jojen only ""has visions that matters... you,"" saying to Bran; it's all about Bran and how to defeat the Night King. And ""Surrounded by enemies"" was the event where the Night King got the dragon.   

Let's see all Jojen's visions:

1) Bran &amp; the three-eyed raven

2) Catelyn's death (""promise me, no more climbing"")

3) His death (I know he was talking about Karl Tanner, but it applies to his death too. Which is more important. Visions are not literal, only glimpses or brief, open to interpretation. He only said that to Karl to stall him because he was about to rape his sister, Meera. He did see the Night's Watch burning Craster's Keep.)

4) Craster's Keep burning (important information to persuade Bran not to meet with Jon, as this would make Jon stop Bran from going to the Three-Eyed Raven.

4) The Great Weirwood Tree

5) Hodor's death (""Even Meera &amp; Hodor, we're only here to guide you.)

6) The end (the flaming hand)

7) Robert's Rebellion (""My father never talked about the rebellion, but I saw that too."")

8) The storm when they were at The Gift/widmill (because it was the first time ever Bran wargs to Hodor)

These informations are all that matter. All important visions. Not some ""Jon Snow was surrounded by the wildlings."" And besides, the wildlings was never their enemies. The wights and White Walkers were. Jon even united the wildlings to fight with them, against the dead, and I'm sure Jojen knew this future event. I mean, he didn't even see Rickon's death, and that was the time Bran sent him to the Umbers. Because visions are always selective.",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Yes i know this show has some flawless episodes but this is probably my favourite with the Winds of Winter. That sheer moment when Eddard's head is on the floor the sounds stops, Arya is pulled out by Yoren, brilliant what a way to make the scene emotional, Catelyn's scene with Robb is brilliant when he is hitting the tree and Catelyn breaks his down, brilliant, Joffrey in this episode is so brutal, after Baelor this was really the start of his cruel reign, when he shows Sansa Ned's head is digusting. Robb's King in the North scene was incredible and one of the best in the entire series,Although Umber's laughing is a bit ridiculous, but his speech is great (not as good as Lyanna's though). Absolutely brilliant acting allround from Robb,Theon,Cat. Cat's scene with Jaime was like i've said before really good, You can see after Nikoli's comments that he has regretted what he said, Cat does it brilliant to hold it together while Jaime absolutely roasts her. I loved the way Cat ask Jaime what happened to Bran and he arrogantly admits, typical S1-3 Jaime. Another example of phenomenal acting on Charles Dance's side, i've seen a youtube video about how he commands respect, and this is the perfect example, standing as a sign of power and waiting for others to speak so he can think of the perfect response. Another example Tywin dosen't ask Tyrion to serve he tells him, he has to showing that Tywin will always win in these situations. Although I wasn't the biggest fan of Daenarys losing Rhaego and having to kill Drogo, Emilia still did a great job, i honestly don't understand how people consider her a bad actor. Jon is willing to risk his life to help Robb, that's just another example of the bond between the Stark family. Varys and Littlefinger's war of words. WOW there's nothing more satisfying then having two of the most powerful people of there professions battling, and this is what that is. Two Genius's going one on one. The beginning of the Arya and Gendry relationship, really liked this scene Hotpie is only acting like a dick, because with the situation your, the more people that fear you the better, Gendry standing up for Arya was great too, the beginning of the trio. Jon Snow finally becomes proud of his role as a member of the Night's Watch. He is proud to go beyond the wall. The final shot of this season is arguably my favourite moment of the entire series, Daenarys rising from the flames with the three dragons, incredible. The beginning of the end. I wasn't a big fan of season 1 but the two final episodes saved the season. This episode is really underrated.",3,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

In all honesty here, Littlefinger played the Game of Thrones better than anyone. Any character you can think of who was murdered, probably could have been prevented if Littlefinger never existed. 

Ned, Catlyn, Rickon, Robb, Tywin, etc.
Baelish betrayed ned and Catlyn
causing Rickon to go into hiding.
Which caused Robb to rebel, leading to his death. He helped poison Joffrey which got Tyrion framed, ultimately leading to Tywins death.

In season 7, Baelish gave Bran the knife that was meant to kill him, saying that it started the war of the 5 kings. He was right. Adding on to that, he persuaded Lysa to kill Lord Arryn. If Lord Arryn never died, Robert never would have came to Winterfell, and Ned and the Starks never would have went to Kings Landing. Thus any major plot point you can think of was due to Lord Baelish.

Before i explain,i will mostly mention the series since i've not finished reading all the books yet,so if this has been explained,forgive me.

In season one as we all know,a person that persumably died came back to life and went to attack the Lord Commander in his chambers,before he was killed by Jon Snow. Later in the series,we learn that the Wall besides being a massive structrure that protects the Seven Kingdoms against physical attacks,is also infused with magic that counters that of the Others so they won't be able to pass through it. Well,in season seven we find out that the White Walkers are the ones who ressurect the Wights besides controlling them and if a White Walker gets killed,all of the Wights that he ressurected die with him. If that's the case,then does that mean that a White Walker came so far south to be able to ressurect the dead man without the Night's Watch noticing him?

[Photographs of inside Titanic Studios shows a set which has the roof destroyed](https://twitter.com/GoTlikeLocation/status/1006109709785534464).  Given the look of the windows it appears to be the throne room.  Further the roof has not (at that point of time, and it was near the end of filming so unlikely to be changed) been painted black to show it was burnt. So it looks like something has crashed into it.  [There were ballistas mounted on the front gates](http://watchersonthewall.com/dragons-to-face-new-threat-in-season-8/), so chances are they will be used.  I believe Rhaegal will be hit by the ballista and crash into the throne room. 


Danys visions in the House of the Undying seem to point to death of her children. She goes North of the wall and that is where viserion died.  She goes to a Dothraki tent and that is where Rhaego died.  All the while her dragons are crying out to her for help.  We also see a destroyed throne room.  So it is possible this is where another one of her dragons die.  Bran also saw the same vision of the throne room, which means it is something that will happen and isnt some kind of metaphor. Bran also sees a dragon flying towards the red keep. And watchers on the wall reported that [Kings Landing will be razed by dragons](http://watchersonthewall.com/exclusive-spoilers-two-main-locations-star-in-game-of-thrones-season-8-battles/).

So what has this got to do with Cersei?  I think she is in the throne room at the time. She has locked herself in there ready to drink poison so she wont be captured. The dragon misses her but both are still alive.  DnD like to make metaphors literal.  A few examples;

Arya was blinded by revenge

Arya was at the crossroads when she decided to go to Winterfell instead of Kings Landing

Sansa took the leap (from Winterfell wall) and faced her fears
Lysa was standing on the edge (batshit crazy)

Cat was negotiating for Robbs life with cutthroats

Theon **was** cocky

Jon was lured out by Olly Olly Oxen Free

Cersei was supposed to have a miscarriage at the end of season 7 (awayfortheleads leaks and also the hacked script outline), but that scene was cut.  Most likely moved to season 8.  But when that occurs Cersei (and this is gross) is dead inside.

I think the final one will be Cersei played with fire and gets burnt.

This does loosely fit with the Maggy the Frog prophecy in the books;

Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.


The valonqar ( little brother) could be Rhaegal.  All the dragons are the same age, however Rhaegal is smaller than Drogon making him the little brother, by size and not age. But Viserion is also smaller, but a ballista is not going to do much to Viserion and if he falls in the throne room it would be completely destroyed. However Rhaegal would be badly injured so isnt going to move much. 

Rhaegal does not fit very well into the next part of putting his hands around her throat, so this could be where it all falls apart.  However bat wings are said to be hands because of the digits and thumb.  GRRM specifically modelled his dragons with two legs and bat type wings. But most likely that is for aesthetics. And it seems way to vague for anyone to even pick up on that reference if that is what GRRM was trying to achieve. However with words he can describe Rhaegals wings as hands.  And that could be why the show left it out.

So the final result is that Cersei gets trapped by Rhaegals wings and is getting crushed.  He wakes up, moves his head closer, opens his mouth,we see the same view of fire in his mouth as when we saw with Tyrion when he took the chains off, except this time he burns her. 

I dont believe the little brother is jaime, he would never kill Cersei because he thinks she is pregnant.  The same for Tyrion.  For either of them to kill Cersei would be a bad blow for their characters.  It would be a very sad ending for both of them considering how Tyrion felt about killing his father.  It is not a thing he deserves. I cant see it being Arya since she already did her revenge thing with the Freys, and nobody else really deserves that kill, except maybe Sansa, but I cant see her doing something with her own hands.

I've hard people celebrating the death as a long time coming, calling the scene in which it happens satisfying and well done, but equally people complaining that the death was undeserved, unfitting of Littlefinger's character and shakily set up.

While I do personally think the death could've been set up better within Season 7 itself: showing Bran fully exposing Littlefinger's past to Sansa/Arya, as well as providing a reason why Littlefinger wouldn't flee following the ""chaos is a ladder conversation"" (something as simple as the route to The Vale being a near death sentence in winter could've worked, or him being unable to return to King's Landing because of his past with Cersei), I still the death itself makes itself within the scope of the story as a whole.

Yes, Littlefinger is intelligent. Yes, Littlefinger is powerful. He's cunning, well connected and influential. But he was never invincible, and worse still, in Season 7 he was in unfamiliar territory.

We see a fatal flaw in his ""game"" as early as Season 2. Cersei, a character who wields much more straightforward, pure power, could've immediately ended the game and crushed Baelish with one order to the Kingsguard. All his scheming and intelligence was shown to be powerless against someone who both wielded power and understood the type of person he was.

We see this to an even greater extent with Varys, another player in the ""game"" who fully understands Littlefinger's true self and motivations. Varys is equally connected, intelligent and knowledgable and so is shown to be on equal footing to Baelish. *Now imagine Varys x1000*. A character knowledgeable about not just every secret in the realm, along with the motivations and past of every inhabitant, but who also possesses supernatural abilities and can't be swayed, bought or misled. **That character is Bran Stark.**

Those that talk about Littlefinger's skill at the ""game"" don't seem to mention that Littlefinger never could've predicted or factored in a supernatural element entering in. His game works best with those he knows and understands (Ned Stark, for example), in familiar territory (King's Landing), and with others he can use for his own ends. None of those were present at Winterfell.

By Season 7, Baelish was out of his depth. He was in an area of Westeros he wasn't familiar with and that took honour far more seriously. He couldn't rely on Sansa to support him in his game (she was on to him as early as Season 6, that much was made clear). He had never met or understood Arya in any real capacity, and worst of all, Bran was literally the foil to his entire scheme, a character who possessed every truth and every secret surrounding him, with supernatural skills he clearly underestimated or disbelieved. Not to mention that **every one of these hostile factors he had a hand in creating.**

Like Ned Stark whom he betrayed, he found himself in a city that didn't share his ideals, surrounded be people who hated him and wanted him gone. By the trial, which I believe was done quite well, him not making it out alive was not only guaranteed but obvious. He was powerless, exposed and had lost his main source of power: words, which he still tried to spit out even as he bled to death. So for me, even if not executed 100% well, his death still felt justified. His actions caught up with him, and at a point in the story that made sense. Does anyone else feel this way?",56,44,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know that the sword isn't passed down to every male heir of House Dayne, but rather one who is worthy enough to bear the title of ""Sword of the Morning"". However, in the current situation the living find themselves in they are in dire need of tools to defeat the white walkers and their army of the dead. Tons of dragon glass is being mined on Dragonstone, but the number of known Valyrian blades is five (Longclaw, Oathkeeper, Widow's Wail, Heartsbane, and the Catspaw). I may be missing one, but I think that number is correct. 

So with the incredibly finite amount of Valyrian steel, could we potentially see the ancestral Dayne sword come into play? After all Night always ends in Light. Let me know what you guys think!",16,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Arya wanted to be able to fight like the boys, Bran used to climb walls to see further, jon didn't want to be a bastard, Sansa wanted to marry joffrey and be Queen and Dany wanted a home and family.

Those things no longer matter to them as Sansa doesn't want another husband. Arya is an assassin, Bran just wants to walk let alone climb, jon became king so being a bastard didn't matter, Dany went home to Dragonstone and it didn't feel like home.

So now Bran can see so far he probably sees into the future. Jon is not only not a bastard but heir to the throne. I believe Sansa will become Queen and as a regnant. Arya will become a knight and Dany with jon will go back to old Valyria. She gets a whole country as her home with family. I don't think the targs will be wanted in westeros after giving the NK a dragon, also if a dragon survives it doesn't belong in westeros. The Unsullied also go and with the dragons (more will come), will protect Naath (note about this at bottom). Sansa won't rule alone she will rule with Arya and Bran, and their plan is to become the start of a democracy.

So we have the bitter part to all the sweet part of their wish fulfillment at the end of their journeys. Bran will never walk, Sansa will never marry, Dany will never rule, The family jon knew are not as he thinks and Arya will never fight like a man, but she fights differently and better.

I think we see the end of all houses. This is the last generation. Even jon and dany who will become Valyrians and not Targaryens.

Also their journeys align to the god of the seven if we include the other two main houses Baratheon and Lannister (all 4 sigils shown in the opening credits on the armillary sphere).  Father - jon, will judge the souls of the dead.  Dany- mother (mhysa). Sansa - maiden (never marries again). Arya-stranger.  Bran-crone. Gendry-smith. Tyrion-warrior.  Tyrion fighting in the great war as a dwarf with no skills, shows him as being the bravest, a true warrior.  You can only be brave when you are afraid.  

Also the rebirth of old Valyria sounds a lot like the Azor Ahai prophecy.  Reborn amidst salt and smoke,the smoking sea.  Under a bleeding star, the volcanoes shooting lava and covering old Valyria.  Wake dragons from stone.  All the dragonlords and dragons are covered by lava and are now stone.  Reawaken it means a new era of dragons. 



* note on Naath.  A dialogue was cut from season 7 (information came from awayforthelads) where Missandei and grey worm talk about plans after the war.  GW says they don't belong in Westeros and asks Missandei if she will return home after their Queen wins the war.  Missandei says their home is with their Queen and Naath are peaceful (meaning they are not sage from slavers).  GW replies that the Unsullied are not peaceful and will protect Naath.  From valyria the Unsullied and any remaining dragons can protect Naath.

3.Robb,Talisa &amp; Catelyn by Boltons &amp; Freys.
4.Jon Snow by the brothers of the nights watch.
Only Starks that didn't die due to betrayals are Lyanna &amp; Benjen.Technically Lyanna died as a Targaryen while Jon who actually is a Targaryen have all the traits &amp; values of a Stark.I don't know about Benjen though. 
So my question is if whether Night King who is presumed to be a Stark was betrayed too and he is coming to seek revenge of that betrayal?The way he looked at 3 eyed raven before killing him makes me believe that he was betrayed &amp; something wrong was done to him.If Bran dies then i think he'll be betrayed too or perhaps already been betrayed by 3 eyed raven.Old Nan also said that ""Don't listen to the crows.They are all liers"".The intention of 3 eyed Raven might not be bad though &amp; perhaps it was out of necessity.What are your thoughts about it?

Here's the tldr version:  small and big changes abound in book 2. The show would've benefited greatly if they had the budget they have now in earlier seasons. So many more fun battles. Having said that, the Canonists, the people that think the book is always better than the show, are stupid. The Battle of Black Water Bay is much better in the show. Arya and Tywin is a thousand times better dynamic than Arya and Roose Bolton. But there are also some things I really would've liked to see in the show, the Stannis loyalists telling Joffrey off, Weasel (Arya) and the broth jail escape, the riot in King's Landing is way better in the books, etc. 

Donal Noye, excellent character, one armed blacksmith that crafted Robert's war hammer and was sent to the wall.

""We're all liars here and every one of us is better than you."" In the show, this is a Bealish line, in the books it's a Hound line. I'm surprised by my reaction to this but it angers me that this was changed. 

Patchface, very interesting character, possible water wight, fool that speaks in riddles and song, but often times what he fixates on is of great importance.

Maester Cressen is much sadder in the books. He was basically a surrogate father to Stannis and tried everything he could think of to avert disaster for his Lord, even going so far as to poison himself and the red woman to put an end to her trickery, but she was unaffected by the poison and his plan came undone. 

Davos has multiple sons in the book.

Bronn isn't head of the Night's Watch when Janos Slynt is sent to the wall. It's another man, Ser Jacelyn, that Tyrion aides in exchange for loyal service and to remove the Gold Cloaks out of Cersei's hand. 

Lord Baelish talks openly about taking the Tully girls (Lyssa and Catelyn) virginity. I hate him even more in the books.

Stannis hits Storm's End in the books while that fool Renly is having a mock tourney to celebrate his foregone victory. Summer boys fail at winter war. So there are two shadows, one was used to kill Renly and the second was used to kill Lord Cortnay Penrose who held Storm's End after Renly died. But the important thing to understand is that Stannis gave Melissandre the One True D, not once but twice. It's also interesting how Stannis dreams and his shadow acts out the dream. He actually sees his brother die as if he were actually there. So the shadow, isn't a child so much as an extension of Stannis himself. Also Melissandre beams with light when she gives birth. Again, it seems a lack of budget forced things to be simplified. Only one shadow means you can get away with not showing Storm's End and that shadow cgi was probably expensive in its own right. 

Theon's conversation with Yara (Asha in the books) when first arrives on Pyke goes about similarly. She's married in the books. 

Tyrion poisons Cersei to make her have incontrollable bowels so she'll be out of his hair as he can make plans for Kings Landing's defense. 

The seastone chair at Pyke. You don't see it in the show I believe but it's carved from this black stone thousands of years ago into the shape of a kraken. Some think it's evil. 

Ser Alliser Thorne is sent to King's Landing with the hand that was cut off from that wight that attacked Jon Snow and Lord Commander Mormont. By the time he gets to King's Landing, it decomposes. Thorne is openly mocked but Tyrion does supply the watch with more men although, he does so in a manner that makes it suggest he doesn't take the man seriously and just wants to be rid of him. 

Arya's kill list has way more characters in it:  Dunsen, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling, Weese. All Lannister soldiers and they reveled in cruelty. I really wish Game of Thrones started with the budget they have today but the decisions to cut some of these minor characters make sense but the book is made richer by comparison. 

Ramsay makes noise much earlier in the books. While the rest of the North is at war, he raises a host army at the Dread Fort. He has a companion, Reek. Not Theon Greyjoy, this one was with Ramsay from the time he was a boy. Ramsay kidnaps Lady Hornwood and forces her to marry him so he can take her lands. Ser Roddrick goes to deal with Ramsay and ""Ramsay"" is killed and Reek captured. What actually happened was Reek was killed and Ramsay took his clothes and covered himself in shit so he could pretend to be Reek. Ser Roddrick keeps ""Reek"" alive to act as a witness to Ramsay's crimes. Ladyhornwood starved to death in a tower where Ramsay imprisoned her. Jojen Reed has a green dream where ""Reek"" skins both Bran and Rickon and he shares this information with Bran. Green dreams always come true.

The Quaithe touches Dany on her wrist and it tingles. I've heard a theory where Dany is poisoned by Xaro Xhoan Daxos and that tingle is the Quaithe delivering an antidote. The presence of Dany's dragons and their growth coincides with the growth of magic. In the show the warlocks tell this to Dany in the House of the Undying, in the book the Quaithe reveals it to her. 

There's a small scene where the Princess Myrcella is being sent to Dorne and Tommen cries. Joffrey mocks him saying ""princes aren't supposed to cry"" and Sansa points out a couple of historical examples that disprove him. In the show, Sansa says her brother cried when she left Winterfell. It's a small difference but it seems to me D&amp;D avoided the lore when they could so as not to confuse the viewers. 

I like the riot in King's Landing better in the books. ""Brotherfucker, brotherfucker, brotherfucker."" After the Hound saved Sansa, he was most concerned with finding his horse, Stranger. The case of Tyrek, the missing Lannister. I've heard some theories about this. 

The cache of dragonglass daggers that Jon discovers (in the show it's Sam) at the Fist of the First Men was left by someone. If I had to guess, either the Children or Cold Hands. (he doesn't make an appearance in book 2 as of yet, but I am aware of him). Some of the men of the Night's Watch grumbled early on about betraying Geor Mormont and Jon caught some of their conversation but dismissed as a result of fear and hunger, just empty words. You get much more of Qhorin Halfhand in the books. He's very loyal to the Watch, he doesn't hesitate at the prospect of sacrificing himself for the greater good. Mance is after some magical horn to bring down the wall. 

Again the mention of Ashara Dayne as a possible mother of Jon Snow. There are subtle references to Catelyn Stark and stone emotions and feelings. 

That fool Theon takes ""Reek"" (Ramsay) into his service when he takes Winterfell. The Bloody Mummers switch allegiance to the North in negotiation with Roose Bolton. Vargo Hoats lisp is annoying, but he's an interesting character. I know he's Locke in the show. Arya blackmails Jaqen into helping the ""captured"" Northern soldiers. I very much liked the boiling vats of broth being thrown into the faces of the Lannister guards. Also after they've taken the castle, Arya is named Roose Bolton's cupbearer and Amory Lorch is paraded around Harrenhal naked and then thrown into a bear pit, good times. 

The House of the Undying and the imagery from the doors inside is noteworthy. The doors on the left are visions of the future, past and terror. Clear reference to Rob and the Red Wedding, a dead King with a wolf's head clutching a leg of lamb. The vision of Rhaegar with Elia and their child. Rhaegar claiming there must be another for the 'dragon has three heads.' The Undying she meets with tells her she'll face three betrayals then tries to drain the life from her. 

Jon Snow and Iggrite's meeting is much more interesting in the book. She says he has a cursed name, tells him the tale of Bael the Bard. Possible Night King identity. Kinslayers are fucked. 

Sansa and Ser Dontos have regular discussions in the lead up to the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Sansa's talks with the Hound are always interesting. I'm mad that ""if you're weak get out of the way and die, strong arms and strong steel rule this world, never forget it"" didn't make it into the show, such a great line from the Hound. 

Jon has a wolf dream. He sees Bran as a weirwood tree and Bran tries to open his third eye. He scouts Mance's vast camp from afar. It would seem that magic is growin in the North as well. Qorin and his more experienced rangers openly accept Jon's wolf dream without hesitation.

It's Ramsay's idea to use the two farm boys as stand ins for Bran and Rickon. Their bodies aren't burned, the heads are cut off and dipped in tar, the silver wolf broach Bran used to wear is burned with his clothes and reclaimed as evidence. Maester Leun does not react in despair, he keeps his resolve but is still deeply wounded by it. Theon won't have the bodies placed in the Winterfell crypts. When Asha leaves Theon with only 10 more men, ""Reek"" offers to find 200 men that can come to Theon's aide in return for Stark silver. Man, Theon is a fucking idiot. 

The conversation between Catelyn and Jaime is different. I like the show version of it better when Catelyn nearly bashes in Jaime's skull with a rock. 

The Battle of Black Water Bay is very different in the books. Tyrion's chain wall that rises out of the sea trapping Stannis' burning fleet after the wildfire explosion is major. The fact that Stannis is not on a ship and is instead already landed with his host. Davos' dialogue is weaker in the books, ""Mathos!!! GET DOWN!!!!"" is instead replaced with ""No. Nooooooooo!"" Tyrion's part of the battle is absurd. He probably kills at least a dozen soldiers in the books. Give me a fucking break. The Hound doesn't tell Joffrey off in the books. Disappointing changes about in the book version. I like what the show did better. 

People thought that that idiot Loras Tyrell was Renly because he was wearing his armor. A clever trick I'll admit. The fools that broke from Stannis' army cheering ""Renly!"" are all probably going to be executed by Joffrey. Good job dumb fucks. 

Dany's encounter at the House of Undying leads to the Warlocks vowing revenge. They promise three betrayals, one for blood, one for gold and one for love. The witch was for blood. The other two haven't happened yet. The attempted assassination by the Sorrowful Men who always say ""I am so sorry"" right before they kill you were the ones that used the poison manticore. Ser Barristan has an odd companion named Belwas, a sellsword formerly of the fighting pits, hired by Illyrio Mopatis. 

Roose Bolton and the Bloody Mummers were in many ways worse than the Lannisters that held Harrenhal. Arya decided once she learned that Roose Bolton would be turning Harnehal over to Vargo Hoat that it was time to leave. She kills a guard by dropping the coin of Bravos and stabbing him in the neck. In the show, this happens much later and it's not a Bolton man she kills to escape Harrenhal, it's a Frey she kills for revenge after the Red Wedding. 

The aftermath of the Battle of Black Water Bay was disgusting pageantry. I respect that not all those captured yielded like pathetic cowards. A few notable men told Joffrey off to his face. These were Stannis men to the last. I would've liked this scene in the show. 

Ramsay returns with 200 Bolton men and attacks Ser Rodrick and those he'd gathered to retake Winterfell from Theon. Theon, the fool, opened the gates without any hesitation and Ramsay cut his men down and ordered Winterfell burned. ",18,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am one of the co-hosts of the Peter Porker Power Hour, a podcast focusing on a range of nerd fandoms, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and more!

For this week's episode, we decided to look at the cultural impact of ""Game of Thrones"". We'd love if you all checked it out and shared your thoughts!

The success of HBO's Game of Thrones has been credited with an increase in the popularity of fantasy themes in mass media. How has Game of Thrones' influence impacted and permeated other fantasy universes and pop culture? In this episode, we explore the fantasy genre pre-Game of Thrones, critique the deviations from novels for the Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings universes, and examine Game of Thrones as second-wave feminist art.

He'll never lose any battles because he knows to always have armor on in a battle and he's not going to have any trouble getting a queen to give him some sons since he's got Arya pretty much chasing after that monster cock of his. 

Every other Lord and Lady will bend the knee to him once they find our how fucking delicious his pies are, and he's obviously got every  great quality that every ruler should have, he's brave, wise, strong, good at making pies, handsome, loyal, he's not a lightweight, honourable, friendly, helpful, ruthless, cunning, funny, and most of all... he knows where to put it.

1155,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-8-15,2018,8,15,8,97d5nu,self.gameofthrones,"[SPOILERS] Felt pretty proud of this prequel pitch, wanted to see if it held up on Reddit",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/97d5nu/spoilers_felt_pretty_proud_of_this_prequel_pitch/,ZKNTAD6,1534288134,"[TL;DR version at the bottom]

I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday about some of the different spin-off show ideas that have been released when this just came to me. Again, I felt pretty proud of it, not just because of the concept, but because it could encompass three or four whole shows for the price of one. Feel free to tear it apart with any and all criticisms, I'm posting this to get better at writing and content creating and I need all the help I can get.

The show would cover the near three-hundred year rule of the Targaryens, focusing on perspectives of the kings and the events that took place throughout their reign. Each season, making the ballsy assumption that I could ever get a multi-season show green-lighted by HBO, would be comparable in size to GOT with some being a bit longer and some being a bit shorter.

The first half of season one would begin on Dragonstone, giving a brief bit of background to the Doom of Valyria and how the Targaryens fled to Westeros. The following episodes would quickly shift to focus on Aegon, his conquest, and the formation of the Seven Kingdoms. The second half of season one would skip over Aenys to the rule of Maegor, his war against the faith, Prince Aegons rebellion, and the Black Brides. The season would end with Maegor being found dead on the Iron Throne, and Aenys son Jaehaerys ascension to the throne.

The first episode or so of season two would focus on the final years of Viserys I, but mostly it would give context and a setup for the rest of the season, the Dance of Dragons. Pretty self-explanatory, but it would show the intensity of the war from both sides, not to mention a lot of dragon duels. It would end with Rhaenyras death at the hands of Aegon II, his subsequent death, and the ascension of Aegon III.

Season three would cover the later Dornish wars led by Daeron I and the aftermath of their failure with the rule of Baelor. The first half of the season four would focus on Daeron, his initial conquest of Dorne, and the eventual rebellion that led to the death of the king, his generals, and many of his men. Daerons death made way for Baelor and his questionable sanity. The second half of the season would begin with his march of penance to Dorne and the return trip with his cousin Aemon the Dragonknight, the resurgence of the faith of the seven, and the Maiden Vault. The season would end with Baelors death by willful starvation, and the ascension of his uncle Viserys II. Throughout the season, Prince Viserys would also share the spotlight with Daeron and Baelor as one of the most influential Hands of the King to that point.

Season four would skip the reign of Viserys II, and head straight for his son Aegon the Unworthy. Aegon, his many mistresses, and his bastards would be the primary focus of the first few episodes before eventually giving way to the rise of the bastard House Blackfire, led by Aegon Blackfyre. The Blackfyre Rebellion would take up the greater chunk of the season, ending of course with it being put down and Daeron II securing the throne. The last few episodes would focus on Daerons efforts towards the Dornish Unification, and the double marriage of Daeron and Daenerys to the Prince and Princess of Dorne.

All of season five would focus mostly on the life of Aegon the Fifth, skipping over King Aerys I and King Maekar. The first half would be his adventures with Duncan the Tall, going all around the Seven Kingdoms and generally having light-hearted fun. The mid-season would end with the Second Blackfyre Rebellion, and Duncan and Aegons part in the conflict. The second half of the season would pick up with the Peake Uprsing and King Maekars death at Starpike. After the Great Council, the rest of the season would cover Aegons reign up until his death. The season would end with the Tragedy at Summerhall, and the birth of Rhaegar Targaryen. His older brother, Maester Aemon, would also make appearances throughout the season.

The final season, of the show would skip over the reign of King Jaehaerys II right to Aegons grandson, Aerys II. His is probably the most familiar story, and as such the season would cover not only the life of the king, but also famous events such as the War of the Ninepenny Kings, the various adventures of the most famous roster of the Kingsguard, and of course Roberts Rebellion. This season could show the gradual, and then very sudden decline of King Aerys into madness, with his wifes various miscarriages and the Defiance of Duskendale. The season would end with the crowning of Robert Baratheon, or maybe the birth of Daenerys Targaryen on Dragonstone.

So there you have it, my full pitch for a GOT spin-off show. You may have noticed that I havent given a name and thats because I like to save the best, or at least the most interesting for me, for last.

One necessity for this theory is the acceptance of another theory that the House of Black and White made an alliance with the Children of the Forest, first created in the hellish mines of Valeria. Valar morghulis!

So if the Children of the Forest use sacrifice to work their dark magic, the House of Black and White makes for a perfect facade to clandestinely collect those sacrifices. It could be from these yet unveiled dark caverns under the temple that they magically destroyed Valeria.

So could something similar be hidden under the crypts of Winterfell? Did the children store their human sacrifices from the many years of war with the First Men at this site? Could this location have been the power source for the Hammer of the Waters that destroyed the Arm of Dorne? This kind of Dark Magic might require multiple locations, one to cast and one to power.

Since the timeline is unreliable, we could assume that The Children of the Forest may have attempted to divide Westeros too soon after the Arm of Dorne, lacking the needed amount of sacrifice (to feed the Firewyrms well below the surface?). 

Could this be why the Children of the Forest agreed to the pact; they did not have enough time to collect more sacrifices? And was surrendering the land on which Winterfell would be built part of the pact?  The First Men no doubt wanted to take away the childrens weapon of mass destruction. This could explain the peculiar design of the crypts, with the oldest tombs located at the bottom.

The appearance of the Others may be prerequisite to each catastrophe. If so, does the return of the Others now signal a new doom? With its signs of volcanic activity, perhaps the Doom of Dragonstone is next. If the next Hammer/Doom is anything like the Doom of Valeria, Kings Landing could also likely disappear. This time, the Children of the Forest might just succeed in breaking Westeros in two.

I am writing this down for posterity's sake as I believe this is an original idea.   


If anyone else has come up with this already I'd be very curious to compare notes with them!  


Spoilers ahead, S1-S7 and all the books.

The points get weaker as they go down, but I think there is enough evidence to strongly support this theory.

**Dany and Jon are going to have a baby, but it is going to be a White Walker.**

I think one of the final scenes of the series will be the newborn child of Dany and Jon opening it's icy blue eyes.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:

1.) Mirri Maz Duur's prophecy:

 *""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""* 

  
The show has made it very obvious in Season 7 that Dany and Jon are going to have a baby. There was heavy foreshadowing about their budding romance, and IMO the show runners could have left it at that if there was no baby, but the heir/Dany's ability to get pregnant/Jon questioning Mirri Maz Duur's credibility was brought up many times.

In regards to the prophecy there are four options:

A.) It is not a prophecy, just ravings of a vengeful woman.

 \-- If this was the case it would not be brought up as many times as it is by the show and the books. Also least interesting of the options to let such a plot line fizzle. 

B.) It is a prophecy, but the terms have already been met.

\-- There is a popular theory out there that says that the other components of the prophecy have already been fulfilled. I don't have the link, but it involves:

Quentyn Martell (sun sigil) sailing from the west. The sea could be the Dothraki sea, and the mountain could be the Mountain. 

I highly doubt this, as the terms aren't for her to have a living child but for her to see Khal Drogo as he once was, with bearing a living child as a requirement. The prophecy does not say if the first three things happen she can bear a living child. Also all three of those are kind of shaky IMO. 

C.) The prophecy is misinterpreted, and Dany can have a living child because she is misinterpreting the prophecy.

\-- There is the quote in AFfC that supports this:

 *...Prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is... and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams... Prophecy will bite your prick off everytime,* 

\-- As well as Jon saying MMD might not have been the most reliable source.

HOWEVER:

Martin was quoted as saying: *""Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it's tricky You want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way.""*   


So that leads me to option D:

D.) The prophecy will come true in an unexpected way.

\-- The prophecy says: ""*When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child.""* 

A **living** child.

That is just the kind of detail Martin would sneak in there. 

Dany is going to give birth to a child of **ice** **and fire.** The fire side is well covered with Jon being half Targaryen and Dany being all Targaryen, and the ice is currently under represented. (Jon is only half ""ice"", being half Stark).

If she gives birth to a White Walker it is not a living child.

2.) The story will have a ""bittersweet ending"". 

Martin was quoted as having said as much. I started thinking about this theory because how else can the ending be bittersweet? If the White Walkers or Cersei or any other third party rule all it would not be sweet, but it Jon and Dany rule side-by-side after defeating all it would not be bitter. The leading suggestions are that Jon will have to kill Dany. I could see one or both of them having to kill this child to seal away darkness forever as a very beautiful ending.

Also, if Jon is Azor Ahai reborn, (Personally i am %100 bought in to the fact that AA was Rhaegar and that Jon is Lightbringer), but if Jon is Azor Ahai it would make sense that he has to sacrifice this child in order to parallel the sacrifice that AA the First had to make in order to seal away the White Walkers the first time.

That would also satisfy another prophecy: Dany's three betrayals. She still has to be betrayed for love, which would be perfectly fulfilled by above.

3.) Chekhov's gun/Craster's infant sons

There is a pivotal scene in the earlier seasons where Jon sees Kraster sacrificing his infant son to the Night King, turning him into a White Walker. Chekhov's gun is a concept in literature stating every element in a story must be necessary, ie: ""If you see a gun in the first act it will go off in the second.""

There are a lot of horrific one-off things throughout the show, but they keep reminding us of that one. (Gilly brings her rescued baby along for the plot-ride throughout most of the books/show. To remind us.)

4.) One of the Night's Kings (there seem to be multiple throughout history) was a Stark of Winterfell and a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

This wiki page provides more information, [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s\_King](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_King) but Old Nan told Bran about one of the Night's Kings being a Stark of Winterfell that was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch that fell in love with a woman ""**with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars""** he loved her ""**though her skin was cold as ice"".** This Night's King brought this woman to the Nightfort and bound his black brothers to his will.

I think this is relevant because of the mysterious ties between the Stark bloodline and the White Walkers, the parallels of the woman this Night's King loved and Dany (imagery of pale, ""moon of my life"", skin being ice cold vs being impervious to fire.) While I don't think Dany is an ice queen or undead in anyway, it brings me to my next point:

5.) Jon is some sort of undead being.

We have no idea what happens when you are brought back from death by R'hllor, but it does provide the ""how"" of the ""how could Dany and Jon even have an undead child?"". There is enough mystery there that the showrunners could provide some serious support for in time for the big reveal.

**TLDR:**

**Due to the tricky wording of Dany not being able to bear a ""living"" child, the foreshadowing that she is going to have a baby,  the expected ""bittersweet ending"" of the series, the fact that an old Night's King was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and a Stark, that Jon is undead by mysterious circumstances, that Dany must still be betrayed for love, the cyclical nature of the White Walkers being sealed away the first time and returning, and finally that there is precedence for infant children being turned into White Walkers:**

**I believe that Dany and Jon will have a child but it will be born as  a White Walker and either Dany or Jon will have to sacrifice it to emulate the sacrifice Azor Ahai made when he sealed away the darkness the first time.**",24,18,True,nsfw,,,,,

Lets examine that a bit when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east... This could mean the planet goes retrograde, perhaps as part of something that happens when a really bad winter approaches or is in full swing, something that nobody would know that, except for perhaps the Maesters, because the last time it happened was beyond recent memory; and everyone keeps saying this winter will be the worst in a thousand years. This kind of winter is a special winter, not regular, which we know Westeros has, because Tyrion says hes seen a few winters, but nothing remarkable came of those.

...When the seas go dry... Frozen, perhaps? A desert is merely a place where life is difficult and the landscape inhospitable. In the real-world, Antarctica is a desert, by definition; and for the Dothraki, who are used to sand and dirt, the idea of desert would be perhaps a bit different.

...and mountains blow in the wind like leaves... This could be a foretelling of the Wall collapse from the attack of The Night King riding the now undead Viserion. Likely, the Dothraki would see the Wall as a mountain, and so would have Mirri Maz Duur, having never seen such a sight as a literal giant wall made of ice, she could easily have misinterpreted the vision as a mountain.

...when your womb quickens again... This, I believe is a representative of Daenerys desire to mate again...which she does, finally, with Jon Snow...who at that point still knows nothing of his true lineage.

...and you bear a living child... Targaryans were known inbreeders. Perhaps not because of the love of blood purity, as the myth is explained, but because it is insanely difficult for them to breed with non-Targaryens. We do not know if Daenerys would have carried the child to life or not, as she sacrificed it to heal Drogo, and we know how poorly that went. Jon Snow, is her nephew, the son of Rhaegar, he is a Tergaryen. Daenerys will conceive a child, a living child, with Jon, and give birth to him/her. This will, of course, be a great surprise to everyone, especially Daenerys.

But there is one part of this that is often left out. ...Then he will return, and not before. The he in this is Drogo, the Khal, the dead Khal and husband to Daenerys.  The prophecy was about when would Drogo heal and get better, not, as it was often relayed, about Daenerys ability to have additional progeny.

Once Daenerys gives birth, Drogo will return. Possibly as a wight, but return he will.

This only deals with the show since I've not read the books and this isn't necessarily stating that it will be revealed that Gendry is really Cersei's son on the show, only that there is some compelling evidence to that and it would make a very interesting story.

My theory goes that Cersei and Robert legit have a baby, the brown haired one she tells Cat about and that baby was Gendry.  Cersei obviously loves her children, it is her 1 redeeming feature aside from her cheek bones.  And we know that she is terrified about he Maggy the Frog prophecy about her children dying.


So what if Cersei faked the death of her first child in an attempt to trick prophecy and save her first born son?  We know Robert didn't love her, was constantly drunk and whoring and hunting and based on Joffrey we know he was not an attentive parent.
  So we know he likely isn't very informed about his kids.

What if Cersei conspires with the grand maester to give baby gendry a potion/poison that will fake his death like maybe some essence of nightshade or something.  There are real chemicals that mimic death but leave the person alive so perhaps something was used to fake the death of baby Gendry.

We know Cersei can act so she pretends to freak out to convince Robert, we know Pycell has ""always been loyal to house Lannister"" so he could definitely help and keep his trap shut and so Cersei can have the baby ""taken to the crypts"" where she never visits.


Gendry is then taken away to be cared for by someone else but Cersei being the loving mother she is still visits her son and sings to him like he remembers.  Maybe she even sings the rains of castermere because of course she would.  But Cersei has a problem when Gendry gets a little older and can recognize her better.  He would be in danger if he started claiming the queen was his mother and he was just some random lowborn kid.  So Cersei has to stop visiting him and Gendry is told his mother is dead.


Fast forward several years and Ned arrives, Robert dies, Joffrey goes nuts etc.  But what happens with Gendry?  Gendry is magically saved by being given to the Watch.  This is an important bit.


Ned meets Gendry and mentions that he is a very skilled smith.  His master agrees but later Gendry says his master gave him to the Nights Watch.  Why would a tradesman give away someone as skilled as Gendry?  It makes no sense.  Unless it was because of a royal decree.

We know it was Joffrey that ordered the death of all Roberts bastards.  What if Cersei finds out and she tells Gendry's master (name I forget) that he has to give Gendry to the Watch.  Maybe she forces him, maybe she pays him but the point is Cersei know that her hidden son who is thought to be a bastard must join the watch in order to be safe from a vengeful king...  Are we seeing the parallel yet?


Cersei saves Gendry by having him sent to the watch just like Ned did with Jon.  2 parents that both would do anything to protect their children sending their secret children who are both thought to be bastards to the wall for their protection from a king who would kill them because of the challenge to the their claim to the throne the child represents.  This would be a perfect parallel between Ned and Cersei in how they both love their family and act to protect it even when it costs them personally.

Now Gendry doesn't actually need to learn this or have this revealed in any big way since at this point his lineage isn't as relevant as Jons is but I do think that this could be an interesting twist on the dynamic between Cersei and Ned specifically as well as just a fun theory.

I plan to eventually make one big post before the final season comes out, but this is just a teaser until then(where more exhaustive evidence will be provided).

As I've said before, the hardest part about predicting the final season of GOT, concerns determining the two sides that are fighting(they aren't immediately evident).

In westeros, there are two main ideologies.  One backed by ""science"".  And one backed by ""magic"".

Many charachters wholly hate magic.  The Maesters.  The Citadel.  The Faith of the Seven(the ""new"" religion"").  The Lannisters(who have forsaken the old gods, symbolized by the dying Weirwood tree at Casterly Rock).  And, obviously, Viserys, ""The Spider"", who was assaulted by a sorcerer, who cut off his junk.

On the other hand, many charachters RELY on magic.  The Starks(who use the ""Old Gods"", to power their powers, which long laid dormant, but are now returning with the return of the Dragons).  The Targaryens(who obviously use Magical Dragons to survive).  The Children of the Forest, and Night King also fit into this category.  As do the Faceless Men.  As does Malesandra, and those of her religion.

In GOT history, the story is a story of People who cannot use magic, trying to extinguish the flames of magic, so that they can rule the world.  There is great evidence to suggest the Maesters helped to kill the Dragons(which in turn, made all magic less powerful).  

I don't think it's a coincidence that the Lannisters(who are against the old Gods) are in charge of King's Landing.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the Starks, and Targaryens(both magical) united.  I don't think it's a coincidence that Visereys betraying Daenarys has been so heavily foreshadowed.

I think in the end, this is just ANOTHER emanation of the age old battle of magical people, versus non-magical people.

The whole idea of this story comes from the Catholic Church's persecution of Pagans, Sorcerers, Witches, etc.  The Religion of the 7 is the Catholic Church, metaphorically.

In the end, I think we may see SOME magical families/entities oppose each other, but on the whole, it will be Magical vs non- Magical.

As far as we know, nearly all magic in Westeros is sourced from Weirwood trees.  The ""new gods"", the ""seven"" seem to be fake, and powerless(or at least no evidence of their reality has been seen to date).

So, my question is, what is the relationship between Dragons, and Weirwoods.  They seem to be completely seperate entities in GOT, yet the Dragons seem to have a massive effect on Weirwood trees' powers.

The effect isn't just said.  It's shown.  The Stark kids all of the sudden are all magicians in their own right, except for Sansa(even Benjen).  All over Westeros, we can see magic becoming more powerful, due to the coming of the Dragons.

So, my question is threefold(but they're one in the same essentially).

1.) What is the relationship between Weirwoods and Dragons?

2.) Is there any TRUE magical power source in Westeros, that isn't derived from the ""Old Gods"", or the Weirwood Trees?

3.) IS Melisandre's magic derived from Dragons(fire), Weirwoods, or another source?

4.) Is the Faceless Men's magic derived from Weirwoods as well?  Does the ""Many Faced God"" possibly refer to the ""Isle of Many Faces"", in Westeros, where the Main Weirwood Network Resides?

I love the story, I love that it has so many great characters, I love the damn credits scene for god sake, it's just that good a show. However, after watching vids, reading people's comments in the forums, etc I find it very interesting that one of the most hated and most loved by some too is Daenerys. My favorite two characters in the show are Tyrion and Jon but I do like Dany most of the time and I honestly don't get why so many people seem to hate her that much, sure she's not the hero Ned Stark was or Jon Snow is but almost everyone in this show seek power one way or another and from what I've read she takes the most hatred of all characters on the show for it. I agree she hasn't been the best ruler at all but up until she married Drogo no one actually thought she'd rule anything so she didn't have any experience or knowledge to do it whatsoever. Plus she does respect her comrades (Jorah, Barristan, Grey Worm, etc), and respects their advice. Of all people that want power (Stannis, Joffrey, Cersei, Walder Frey, Ramsay, Roose, Baelish etc I'm sure I'm missing many more) she's probably the only one that actually seems to have a good cause (freeing slaves), ofc she's obssessed with power, 95+% of the characters are but at least she doesn't betray her friends like everyone else does.  That's my opinion but would love to hear from you on the matter. :)",1,1,False,self,,,,,

(Contest?),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/985p98/spoilers_a_game_of_endings_contest/,phmsanctified,1534537574,"So like everyone else I'm tired of waiting for Winter to come, so I thought of a game.

I'm going to lay out some questions and answer them myself with my own predictions, and whoever gets the most right by the end of the show will get gold. If I win, then someone can be nice if they want and gold me, if not it's fine. I have zero ties to the show, I'm in the dark like the rest of you. So here's my questions (and you can even contradict yourself in an earlier question if you have feelings towards something but aren't sure which way it's gonna go). I'm mainly just doing this to spark some interesting thoughts or theories from you guys too.

**One specific rule: No one bashes anyone's prediction**

**Who kills Cersei**: I think that somehow Jaime is going to accidentally kill her, like for example in one of Bran's visions the throne room looks damaged with snow coming in, I could see like a piece of the roof falling and it knocks Jaime over onto Cersei who is smothered by his gold hand because of it's weight and being heavily pregnant making him both the King and Queenslayer.

**Who kills The Mountain:** My heart says Sandor but my head is saying Brienne.

**Does Jon find out his true lineage:** I think Jon will be spared from an embarrassing situation when he returns to Winterfell with his pregnant Aunt/Bride. I can just see Sam turning to Bran and shaking his head no vehemently when Bran goes to tell him the truth after Jon is like ""Guys! This is my new woman, and she's pregnant!"". I do think there could be potential for a really funny scene if they do tell Jon. Poor Jon.

**Who survives between Jon and Dany (or both or neither):** I have a feeling one is going to sacrifice themselves to save the other. I'm betting on Dany sacrificing herself to save Jon, which devastates him, maybe even sending him back to Castle Black finally a broken man after losing two loves.

**Who rules Winterfell:** I think Arya will somehow end up ruling Winterfell while Sansa ends up with whoever ends up on the Iron Throne.

**Who hooks up?:** I think Arya and Gendry will be a thing.

**Who ends up on the Iron Throne:** I've had the hardest time with this, I think someone unlikely, like maybe if Jaime is mortally wounded he tells Bronn his payment is the throne.

**Who makes a surprise return?:** Another tough one, I have a feeling there's going to be a return of someone I'm just not sure, so I'm just going to say Benjen who can now cross past the wall.

**Saddest Moment:** I have a feeling that we are going to see some dead (favorite) characters in the undead army, and I think one of those people will be a undead Hodor breaking our hearts all over again slugging along.

**Who kills the Night King:** I'm torn between this and the Cersei thing happening, I think it'd be poetic for Jaime to kill the Night King so that his Kingslayer nickname becomes a POSITIVE one instead of an insult, so I'm going with Jaime with this one too. 

**Surprise Character:** I have a feeling that Rhaegar is not dead and that he will make an impactful return to save the Starks or his own son.

**Tyrion's Fate:** We all love big T, but I have this horrible feeling that he is going to make some BAD choices in Season 8 and will either cause us to dislike him, or his own death.

**Theon's Fate:** I don't see any situation where there's a happy ending for Theon, I think he defeats Euron in a battle to save Yara but ultimately dies from his wounds in his sister's arms a true Ironborn.

**Terrible ending that pisses us all off:** That Robb was right and the whole thing is made up in some giant's head or something like that or the camera pans out and all we see are a bunch of turtles. (Too obscure?)

**Good ending that makes us/you happy:** Things end up resetting like they were before the very first episode but with different people in the same role. For example Jon Snow is the new Ned ruling Winterfell, Gendry is the new Robert ruling Kings Landing with Arya at his side. (The Stag finally gets his She Wolf), Yara rules the Iron Islands with the reaving/raping gone and they live in peace, Sam becomes commander of the Night's Watch after proving his bravery in the battle of the undead. The Lannister house is wiped out except for Jaime who joins the Night's Watch mirroring his mockery of them in the first season.

I can see her showing up as Littlefinger early on in the season and attempting to influence what is going on in King's Landing and possibly even killing some key players. The Mountain still remains on her list and I feel as though we will Arya finish her list before they end this. I can imagine a lot of possible situations where Littlefinger's face might come in useful however I would love to hear what everyone else thinks it will be used for, or if it will even be used?

On a side note, all of the faces in the House of Black and White look very well preserved. They also spent a fair amount of time showing Arya wiping down and ""cleansing"" the bodies before they were sent down to the basement.

Here are **my** thoughts:

  * Jon Snow was resurrected by the Red Witch. Cool. We were all happy. I think that Jon Snow has returned from the dead three times. 1) Red Witch resurrection...2) he drowned when he fell through the ice fighting the Army of the Dead so Dany and the 2 remaining dragons could escape with the wight and the other members of the ""Let's-go-fetch-a-dead-guy"" team...3) he froze to death on the way back to the Wall (seriously did you hear how his clothes came off? Totally frozen.) The same residual magic that animates the Wights/Walkers, whatever, kick started him. He was already resurrected so he didn't become one of them.

 * He's a Targaryen, and a Stark. He also seems to never, ever, be affected by the cold. You can't burn Dany...what if you can't freeze Jon? It'd be a lot of fun if the Zombie Ice Dragon blasted him and he just looked at it, like, ""Seriously, that's the best you got?""

 * Most importantly, the dragons seem to be aware he's a fricking Targaryen. Drogon gave him a good sniff, and poof! allowed Jon to pet him. I'm willing to bet if that Zombie Ice Dragon wanders into Jon's proximity, that dragon will answer to Jon.

    How much you wanna bet Jon and Dany are on their honeymoon cruise? It sure would solve a lot of problems. Now, we got Dany and a dragon, Jon and a dragon, and I'm betting Bran can warg into the other one. Now you got 3 dragons, and 3 dragon riders (a potential interpretation of the *Dragon with 3 Heads* thing.

Just my thoughts.

This leaves Gendry to take the throne and Arya as his lover. I just think that since everyone expects Either Jon OR Dany or both to live is EXACTLY why he wouldnt let them live. He does goes out of his way to be unorthodox as far as his plots go. So yes they both die and Gendry takes throne. Why keep Gendry around otherwise? Why write him in so much and give him a plot line?

When daenerys is about to go into labour, ser brought her into the tent. Did she get caught up in the ritual?

Isn't the ritual supposed to involve the horse only, why is her baby affected?

If it's intended, does it mean if the witch came with goodwill, she will be able to heal drogo?

Basically I don't believe Jon and Daenerys will marry. I believe they are destined to have a child together but nothing more will happen despite any love they feel for each other. I also don't believe Jon is Azor Ahai. 
Let me explain.

Tyrion is the centre piece of this puzzle that will essentially in a way screw everything up but at the same time make everything work. 
 We saw in season 7 that he was talking to Daenerys about successors and the fact she can't have a child anymore. And later in the final he spoke to Cersei and learnt she was pregnant. Now I'm confident that Tyrion has betrayed Daenerys off screen during that scene with Cersei.  And my guess it has something to do with children. Especially since Tyrion gave that look while Jon and Dany were heading to bed together on the boat. I don't know how he's betrayed her exactly but I believe he has, especially since Dany in the books is warned not to trust the lion. 

So basically when Jon and Daenerys find out they're having a baby, Jon will say how he'll want to marry her because he'll never want a bastard. BUT just because a character wants something doesn't mean it's going to happen (especially in GOT) and honestly.. I'm sure just the opposite will happen. 
I think  Tyrion will talk Jon and Daenerys out of marrying each other and say how the North won't accept Jon being a Targ and/or marrying a Targ. I think Sansa will also push the North against it too. And they may even call Sansa Lord/Queen of Winterfell in his place. Jon of course will argue that the dead are coming and not care what title he holds as long as they fight together. However there will be a clear rift between Jon, Dany Tyrion and Sansa and the Northern armies. I think at this point Tyrion has made an uncertain choice that he is in fact a Lannister and all those scenes last season of him feeling guilty and hurt for his armies being slain all add to this. He loves his family. He lives his house. And I think that's the core of his nature. I believe he wants the Lannister to have the iron Throne. He probably doesn't care for Cersei so much but only her child. 
Anyway.. At this point everyone knows about Jons heritage. But only a smaller group know of her pregnancy with Jon. And this is where Jorah enters the mix.. Tyrion will want to make good with the North as an obvious rift has occurred. He still believes the world needs to be saved of course and his family won't be able to rule if there is nothing to rule over. However he keeps those intentions to himself. 
He tell Dany she should marry one of the other Northern Lords but she is extremely hesitant. Then Tyrion looks to Jorah. Jorah of course is shocked at this point and Dany is a little rattled by the prospect too. But Tyrion will explain to her that the North may just accept an alliance if you marry someone of the North. And he'll be right. The plan will be that Jorah and Daenerys marry and the child will be known as Jorah's. This goes full circle with Ned lying about being the father of Jon to the rest of the North. The North don't like Jorah but Jon will explain he was the first to volunteer to go beyond the wall and that he was pardoned of his past crimes. They will reluctantly accept. 

Just to sum the last bit up quickly, the war will come against the army of the dead and Dany will have her child at the beginning of it. Jon will be off fighting at this point but Jorah will be with her. Sam has also offered Jorah Heartsbane at this point. Daenerys will be in so much pain and anguish after her child she'll tell Jorah to kill her (bear her breast) Jorah with a heavy heart will do it by plunging the sword through her chest. Later in the battle Jorah will kill the Night King but die in the doing of it. 
(Ending the war) 

In the final  Jamine would have killed Cersei and someone else would be on the throne.. Possibly Tyrion? 
Jon will raise his child in winterfell and the kid will grow up never knowing his mother like Jon never knew his when the series started. 

I'm aware of the holes in this theory but I think there is something there considering all the clues from past seasons. Especially between Jorah and Daenerys and Tyrion and his love for his family.

On top of that, Dani also dies (to fulfill the prophecy because they are lovers and he plunges the sword into his lover). So both Dani and Jon both die. This leaves Gendry to take the throne and Arya as his lover. I just think that since everyone expects Either Jon OR Dany or both to live is EXACTLY why he wouldnt let them live. He does goes out of his way to be unorthodox as far as his plots go. So yes they both die and Gendry takes throne. Why keep Gendry around otherwise? Why write him in so much and give him a plot line? Then he will have a long rule and be a good king since he understands the commonfolk. Thats my theory and Im sticking to it. Feel free to point out flaws.

I have seen a lot of speculation that Arya may use Jaime's face to assassinate Cersai however I feel like this would be a much more likely possibility. Littlefinger may not have been trusted by everyone however he was respected and had a way of influencing people. I can see her showing up as Littlefinger early on in the season and attempting to influence what is going on in King's Landing and possibly even killing some key players. The Mountain still remains on her list and I feel as though we will Arya finish her list before they end this. I can imagine a lot of possible situations where Littlefinger's face might come in useful however I would love to hear what everyone else thinks it will be used for, or if it will even be used?

On a side note, all of the faces in the House of Black and White look very well preserved. They also spent a fair amount of time showing Arya wiping down and ""cleansing"" the bodies before they were sent down to the basement. When Arya executed him, she slit his throat, meaning his face is nicely intact. Will the Many Faced God accept faces that have been mangled?

Going further south was out of the question; the Lannister-Tyrell force would smash him. He couldnt retreat North to retake Winterfell, both because it would mean abandoning his subjects in the Riverlands and because hed never be able to muster the troops to ride south again. Finally, he certainly couldnt stay at Riverrun while attrition, factionalism, and loss of prestige eroded his cause. 

Robbs plan in the TV show to march west and take Casterly Rock was desperate and wildly unrealistic, but theres some sense in the overarching structure of it. Recover fighting strength with the Frey men, blitz the Westerlands, and seize important Lannister holdings to undermine their authority in the region and regain the initiative. Assuming in this (highly,highly) unlikely scenario that Walder Frey keeps his word and Roose Bolton doesnt defect, could Robb have had any amount of success campaigning after the Blackwater?

Largely due to peculiar story pacing, nonsensical character motives and an A team style mission north of the wall. Here I provide my outline on how the last few episodes of season 7 should have played out. Bear in mind that I quite liked the pacing and style of the first 4 episodes, I reconstructed the last few episodes of season 7 with the intent to try and construct a coherent and legible narrative in keeping with the GRRM style. While the outline provided below is rough and ready, I do realise that it may not be to everyones liking and appreciate any critque or comment you may have. 

Episode 5: the dothraki pull Jaime and bronn from the water. Danaerys burns bronn as Tyrion looks on disdainfully. She agrees to let Jaime go on the condition that he warns cersei that she's coming for the throne. Jaime is allowed to leave for kings landing. Lord tarly and randyll are burned.
Tyrion and Davis go to kings landing. Davis finds gendry. Jaime tells Tyrion that cersei will never treaty with danaerys. Tyrion Davis and gendry leave for dragonstone.
Danaerys returns to dragonstone. Meets John as usual. John forgives theon for his misdoings. Bran looks into the future and sees the night kings army breaching the wall, he orders the maester to send a letter to John detailing this. John receives the letter and decides to call the northern Lord's to meet the night kings army beyond the wall. He tells danaerys that he must leave but they argue. Danaerys informs him that when she takes kings landing she will then go to winterfell and destroy it. The episode ends with Jon , gendry, Theon and Davis leaving to meet the northern Lord's at the dreadfort.

Episode 6 The mustering at the Dreadfort
The episode begins with Sansa and the northern Lord's arguing about whether or not to go north to meet Jon. Sansa begs them to stay but they reluctantly decide to go north. Sansa blaims bran. Littlefinger continues to convince Arya of sansas faults. Arya begins to distrust sansas judgement. The northern Lord's leave leaving Arya, bran, Sansa and littlefinger at winterfell. Sansa orders brienne and podrick to go too to protect the north. 
Jorah returns to dragonstone to danaerys delight. Tyrion and varys argue with her for letting Jon go. She's angry at first but eventually regrets letting Jon go.
Jon, Davis, gendry and Theon meet the northern Lord's and their armies at the Dreadfort. Theon tells Jon what happened to him there and Jon feels sorry for him. The northern Lord's tell Jon they are with them but agree that it is a foolhardy plan. A few of the Lord's agree to mutiny in secret.
The episode ends with Jon and crew meeting beric, the hound and co at eastwatch by the sea. The whole northern host then traverses through the wall.

Episode 7 North of the wall
Episode begins with cersei telling euron to recruit the gold company and that if he proves successful she will marry him. Jaime spy's on them and overhears this, he is devastated and angry.
Arya is convinced Sansa is conspiring with cersei. Arya attempts to kill Sansa. Sansa pleads with her to stop, Arya is overcome with emotion and drops her knife. Littlefinger watching in the background storms forth and proclaims that he will kill them both and take the north. Ghost intervenes and kills little finger. The girls follow ghost to the godswood and discover that bran had warged into him. Bran tells them that littlefinger was responsible for everything.

Jon and the northern army are north of the wall. Jon meets benjen while they are camped one night and warns them to turn back. Jon disagrees but benjen says he will join their army.

They engage the night king and his army in combat. The northern Lords ( mutineers) ride back for the wall and to their homes. Jon's army takes a beating. Bran appears to danaerys in a dream and tells her that Jon is in trouble and that she must fly north to help them ( on the eve of battle)
Jon and the northern army are largely destroyed by the night king. They begin to retreat. The northern Lord's, the knights of the vale, benjen, beric, thoros and podrick die in battle. Jon, Davis, gendry, thormond and a few flee on foot with the night kings army close behind. 
Danaerys arrives and delays the night kings advance. Jon and co escape on drogon and rhaegal but viserion is killed by the night king.

The group reconvene at eastwatch. Jon apologises to danaerys, she apologises and tells him she will join him to defeat the night king. The episode ends with the dragons flying over the north lamenting the loss of their brother and the night king resurrecting viserion. 

Episode 8 The dragon and the wolf
At dragonstone, Theon tells Jon he must leave to save his sister. (Same theon/ last samurai scene).
Cersei hears of the massacre in the north and grows fearful of this new threat beyond the wall. She agrees to meet Jon, Tyrion, danaerys and co in kings landing (dragon pit). They meet and cersei tells them she will send the Lannister army to join them to help them. She later tells Jaime she was lying and that euron left to get the gold company. Jaime is disgusted and tells cersei he overheard them previously, much to her annoyance. She tells him that there is nothing between her and euron but he disagrees and leaves. Snow begins to fall in kings landing.

Sam and bran discuss Jon's parentage (as per usual).
Jon rides danaerys (as per usual)
Arya apologises to Sansa, and acknowledges that what she went through wasn't easy. She tells her all about her training in Bravo's. Sansa tells her she has changed. But she is still her sister.

Yara is being beaten / tortured on eurons ship. Euron tells her no one will come for her. Cut to Theon sailing with some iron born for Pike.

1472,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-8-20,2018,8,20,0,98l16f,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] 7 theories I hate about game of thrones?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/98l16f/spoilers_7_theories_i_hate_about_game_of_thrones/,Kanaenystargaryen,1534692682,"Hey, so I've been thinking about some famous GOT theories that I really hate and think that most of them make no sense at all, while others make sense but I still don't like them anyway...of course you may have a different opinion, so the discussion's open.   

here we go,       

**Gendry is Cersei's son:** this makes no sense to me, first of all I don't see the point of revealing Gendry as cersei's son, if it's supposed to be an ending twist, it would be a horrible one, and one of the reasons why I don't think that Gendry is cersei's son is that Gendry said he remembers his mother while cersei said that her baby was taken from her just a few hours after he was born, so how come a newborn remember with such details his mother?.      

**Little finger faked his dead:** Just because we see him giving some coin to a random girl doesn't mean she's a faceless girl or even from braavos, his storyline is over and it absolutely makes no sense if he's actually alive, why? to show us how clever he was? was he?...on the other hand, Bran can easily find out if he faked his death, that if arya didn't figured it out by trying to steal his face just like she did with walder frey.         

**Arya is the waif:** if Arya is the waif,  so thanks to her for taking the time to avenge a family that wasn't hers to avenge, and for and being so mean to sansa for almost the entire season...I  mean even if Arya and Sansa's Storyline in season 7 annoyed lot of people, to me it's just also proof that Arya is Arya, and Sansa is Sansa...I would've have some doubts if they hugged each other crying ""I missed you"".    

**Cersei will become the night Queen:** I don't know where this theory comes from, but how is she supposed to become the night queen? I mean who will turn her to a WW, we are not sure that NK can do it since we've only seen him turn babies (and dragons).      

**Bran is Bran the builder:** I don't understand this theory at all...so our bran goes to the past to tell old bran to build the wall...(a wall that already exists)...is that it?...ok, makes sense now.    

**Daenerys is Nissa Nissa:** Ok, this theory is not really  implausible but I still hate it anyway, Dany is already ""Mhysa Mhysa"", so call Nissa Nissa someone else and leave Dany alone.     

**The Prince That was promised will bring the dawn:** and what? he already did in the past and only managed to push back the dead so what's the point? why would whoever is the PTWP care about forging ""lightbringer"" by killing the one they love, when we know that the sword never killed the night king in the first place?.

First of, Fire and Blood is house Targaryen mojo and we now know that Jon is one of them. Daenerys was ""reborn"" in Khal Drogo's funeral and she is always associated with fire through the whole show with her obsession for burning everything wirh her dragons plus her immunity to fire/heat.

As for Jon we know that he doesnt have immunity to fire but he has strong ties with Blood. He was mutilated by is brothers, by his own blood, and left bleeding on the snow. He was born in the blood of his mother, while war was raging and blood was spilling. Plus, there's theory that Shireen's sacrifice is what brought back Jon snow from the dead, wich is blood magic. I may forget other hints here but these are the one that comes to my mind.

In other words, Fire is Daenerys and Blood is Jon. What bugs me, is ""the dragon must have three heads"". Maybe the third head is growing in Dany's womb?

Not sure if it really means something, but I like the nod here.

Seriously, Im tired of being laughed at. Lol! I cant be the first to have this theory. 

Here is my reasoning though. GRRM always unites characters with a challenge or outcome antithetical to their character. So Jaime is a selfish jerk that loses his hand and becomes an honorable altruist, Jon is the bastard that is actually the heir to the throne, Daenerys is the weak helpless girl that becomes a conquerer, Sansa is the naive diva that becomes a hardened political operative, etc. You are all pros, you know this. 

So, what is Tyrions Achilles heel? Women. And in the book how often is Daenerys described as the most beautiful woman in the world? And how much pain does our beloved dwarf suffer because he just wants to be loved? So how sweet would the irony be if the most beautiful woman in the world chooses the ugliest imp? It just fits IMO.

I want to discuss how events would play out if he had not done it.

There are really two outcomes that could result if Jaime didn't slay the king. One, someone lives to light the wildfire and kills half a million inhabitants and Jaime. The other option is that Jaime does not kill Aerys and Ned walks in to the throne room with Aerys alive. 

If he didn't kill the king, he'd be labeled a coward who didn't die defending the king. Ned would hate him for that just as much as he does for him stabbing the king in the back. If he died in the wildfire, he would be remembered as the one man who could have stopped the tragedy and didn't. All of his good deeds would be overshadowed by his ultimate failure, causing the deaths of 500,000 innocent people.

**TL;DR** Jaime Lannister is the embodiment of stuck between a rock and a hard place. No matter what he did that day in the Red Keep, he wouldn't come out of it retaining his honor. It only reinforces my admiration of his character and the difficult choices he's had to endure.

Obviously Pod has always been shadowed over by Bronn when he is shown with Tyrion, however he is still a great character. Although he's mainly for comedic value and let's face it, he's probably bound for death, he still has a lot of great character potential. Gendry, although he has very minimal screen time, is a good character too. In my opinion, he also is the true heir to the iron throne. Why you ask? Obviously he is Robert's son, but some people still say it doesn't count because the Targaryen's are the true dynasty and Gendry was born out of wedlock. However, who get's to say which dynasty has the right to the throne? You may say the Baratheon dynasty is false because they overturned the Targaryen's and that would leave Jon or Dany as ruler. However, the Targaryen's overthrew a dynasty too! If anything, the last dynasty that didn't overthrow another has the right. However, if we are saying that whatever dynasty stands (including overthrowing) has the right to the thrones, then it's definitely Gendry's. However, if Cersei's kid lives to be crowned, it would have the right, because she overthrew the previous dynasty. 

TLDR: Pod and Gendry are both great, yet underrated characters and Gendry could prove to have an important part as the next king.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm a lurker of this subreddit, so my name is probably unknown for you.

One thing I know is that I love Game Of Thrones, but one thing I love more, is its lore and secret messages that are there for us to find. And one thing I like to do is browse theories and see if they could be either true or false.

And while I was reading theories, I thought of something. It's true that the Mormonts are an interesting house. Women that fight the wildlings, a 9 year old girl ruling the house, and the mysterious Bear Island... But that's not the most interesting fact.

The Mormonts possess a legendary sword, Longclaw, made of Valyrian steel.

Well, there's a theory that suggests their sword is not exactly *theirs.* Whilst the theory explains why the sword couldn't be theirs ( There's a few facts about it, which I will explain later ), I will explain why exactly would they own this sword, and no less, give it to someone else ( Jon ).

First, I want to talk about house Mormont. It's a house that established themselves in Bear Island 500 years before the events of Game Of Thrones. It's relatively new, and they actually obtained Bear Island thanks to the Starks ( Interesting story, if you don't know about it, look it up ).

The Mormonts were one of the few houses that supported the Starks in the Battle Of The Bastards, aside from helping the Young Wolf in the War Of The Five Kings. It's well known that they're allies of the Starks.

But what does this have to do anything with their secret mission?

While we know where they live and a few other things, we don't know where exactly they come from. We don't know what they want ( aside from aiding the Starks ). But one thing I thought about could explain why.

You see, Longclaw is a Valyrian steel sword. Not many exist, and bigger houses don't even have one. But, why do the Mormonts have one?

And here is where my especulation starts:

They either stole the sword, or someone gave it to them. Steal, could either mean they stole it from Valyria, or from someone from there. We don't know how the sword looked before Jeor gave it to Jon. 

Also, this means someone knew that the sword must had been kept, and they chosed the Mormonts for this task.

But why all the trouble for one sword? Why all the trouble, to keep it for generations, to just give it to someone else?

The Mormonts, as I said, have helped the Starks since forever. This could explain why Jeor likes Jon and helps him. But why exactly give it to him?

Maybe it's not only for the fact that he is an Stark, but maybe the Mormonts *know* that the White Walkers will come back. Maybe they know the only way to kill them is Valyrian steel. Maybe they know that one hero will rise and defeat the Night King. And the Mormonts had the mission to pass the sword to that one hero.

Jeor knew about the White Walkers. And I recall he said at one point: ""I don't use the sword.""

Why doesn't he use a Valyrian steel sword? Something so valuable and rare? He changed the bear to a wolf in the handle ( We never saw Longclaw before he gave it to Jon, so we actually don't know if it was a bear in there. )

**TL;DR**, the Mormonts knew about the White Walkers. They knew they'd come, and they had the mission to give the sword to a hero that would save the world from them. And their sword is not theirs, but possibly from someone who knew about this, or they simply stole it because they had no other possible way to obtain it.

What I don't know exactly is if they know Jon is a Targaryen, or if they think he is Azor Ahai reborn ( In my opinion, not the best bet ). But what I think is, they know that someone had to come to finally defeat the threat from the North. They aren't the rightful owners of the sword, but maybe they were the keepers to finally give it to who deserved it.

They've had the sword for a long time, they even owned it before Bear Island. And we don't know how they obtained the sword either.

So that's my theory. The Mormonts had a mission to give the sword to someone who was ought to save Westeros. I'm sorry for my grammar mistakes, and I'm sure I left out a lot of things ( I wanted to say a few other facts, but it'd either be too long or too boring, but if someone is further interested I can reply with them ).

I want you to tell me what you think of this theory. Could it be true? Or maybe it's already debunked? Let me know!",16,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

There's compromise on both sides: Daenerys forsakes part of her kingdom, while Yara agrees that the Ironborn's lifestyle of reaving and raping will stop. That's how it should be: alliances are difficult, and require compromise from both parties.

Fast forward one episode and both the Tyrells and the Dornish agree to support Daenerys... with zero discussion. No-one asks for anything, no-one has any objection or conditions, they just... do it. Neither of them seem at all bothered that they'll be fighting alongside an army of Dothraki, eunuchs, and Ironborn. What did either of them actually want from the impending war beyond vague notions of revenge?

Obviously in show continuity Loras, Margaery, and Mace were the only 3 Tyrells in existence, but (had this happened in the books) you'd have thought Mace or Olenna would have demanded that Daenerys marry Loras or Willas. Yet Olenna hands over her army with hardly any protest. I guess you can make the argument that the Dornish didn't care about power, only revenge, but it still seemed so... weak.

Call me crazy but I'd actually have liked to watch a scene where Daenerys, Tyrion, Olenna, Ellaria, and Yara work out a coalition pact. Was anyone else bothered by how effortless it turned out to be?",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know there are theories on how the NW might continue to exist even with the Wall and WW gone , but I don't think this has been suggested before.

I have been rewatching the show and are currently on season 5. Here Davos says something that might hint at the NW possible survival . 

After Jon declines Stannis' offer to make him Jon Stark , Davos asks Olly to say the NW vows.  When Olly says "" the shield that guards the realms of men "" Davos stops him . 
Davos then says: ""As long as the Boltons rule the North , the North will suffer "" 

What Davos hoped to acheive with this was for Jon to accept the offer from Stannis , but it go me thinking that the NW might still have a purpose after the NK are defeated. 

The Night's watch will continue to be the "" shield that guards the realms of men "" , but it won't be from wildlings or White walkers they will protect the realm from people like the Boltons , Cersei , Euron etc. Simply to stop people who wants to supress the people for own gains .

So my suggestion is that the NW will continue to exist as a sort of peacekeeping force in the realm . 

TL:DR: The Night's watch will continue to exist as a military order , but their new function will be as a peacekeeping force who fights for the people and for justice.

Same with Lost almost the entire series goes by and everyone more or less either doesnt change or changes for a time then reverts to the original point. Same in The Walking Dead, the setting changes but the people stay the same. It feels like Game Of Thrones is really the only show on today where if you watch Episode 1 and then watch episode 67 it would feel like you were watching 2 different shows, that is because the world and characters of GoT actually change and evolve, die and give up, it feels like the only show where the actions of the characters and the events of the world actually cause changes in the characters and the way they act and perceive the world. Just look at Sansa or Arya and theyre completely different people in both the way they act and think compared to the start of the show. In contrast Carl from TWD is the same all they was to the end except he got older and could do more stuff, Rick got older and could do less stuff but as characters they basically stayed the same.

Neds father may not accept such an arrangement due to the weight of the stark word and her being bethroed to robert but again I think it would be an argument and not a full on war that would eventually end with him disowning her, and again not war. Rhaegar would take over as the king of the seven kingdoms as the mad king dies....one big thing I think would happen is the role reversal of the stark and Martell story. The starks would be behind the king (after strong pushing from both ned and Brandon to support their lovely sister) but I think oberyn martell and his brother would have waged war on the seven kingdoms with the help of an irate baratheon family over this arrangement. The vale would stay out of the conflict due to Jon arryns allegiance to both robert and ned. The Lannister army would again wait on the outside and stay neutral. The tully's would join the crown and the starks as Brandon stark would be married to catelyn Tully.

Jon could be revealed as an Aegon (he is a true Aegon) where Griff will be a fake Aegon. Will they go to war, make peace or will it all have been as some kind of plot?

Either way the show elected to do away with this whole concept and focus on ONE and only one Aegon. Odds are whatever GrrM is doing with this story would take too long to incorporate into the show and divert from the main thrust, Jon is Aegon. But GrrM does nothing by accident so this character will have a role. 

So I got to thinking about Ned, Jon/Aegon and the impostor Aegon. While I don't think this is the case it is technically possible due to the dates and timelines. 

Not one, but two romances happened at the tourney. 

*According to Allyria Dayne, Ashara and Ned Stark fell in love at Harrenhal.Barristan was also in love with Ashara, although he never told her so. Barristan believes that Ashara was dishonored by someone at Harrenhal.*

So it is physically possible for Jon to have been sired at Harrenhal by Rhaegar but it is also possible for Ned to have sired a child. Ned loved Ashara, Ashara was ""dishonored"" possibly. 

One counterpoint before everyone jumps on Ned is so honorable he wouldn't do this:

Ned is a human being. *Ashara was tall, with long dark hair and haunting violet eyes. She had a reputation for great beauty.* She was really hot and if she chose Ned, then you can't say for sure young Ned would resist. Ned was very shy and she might have been the aggressor, sound familiar? Jon Snow is Ned's son in more ways than anyone else and he broke his vow with Ygritte. Ned might have assumed he would marry her anyway and it wouldn't matter. 

So what if Ashara was pregnant and Ned never knew until after he killed her brother in combat? If Young Griff turned out to be Ned's son, sent away and meant to be another diversion to hide the real Aegon it would be ironic on many levels. 

That would mean that Ned raised a boy as a bastard who was born in wedlock and was the actual Prince of Westeros. He called him Jon Snow when he was Aegon and he was told his whole life he was a bastard.

That would also mean Ned sired an actual bastard, this bastard was raised as if he was a Targ, called Aegon and had all the respect Jon never did. 

Ned's bastard son would be an interesting foil for the real Aegon/Jon Snow. In many ways he would be the antithesis. Everything Jon was accused of being. I doubt GrrM will go this route but it was an interesting thought that Jon could be battling Ned's actual bastard for the throne. I can also see why the show omitted this. With so much going on its not like Jon needs yet another hurdle...he has plenty of issues...",6,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

But what I thought of today is ...

What if the NK is on the move to defend Dany?  She'll have Cersie's army coming for her.  If the NK knows the future (he seems to know where to be and when) then he might know Dany will be in trouble and wants to come to her aid the only way he can... with an undead army.

If I'm right about the NK being Jorah... he would totally come to her defense. He would have waited 8 thousand years to do so.

Honestly, I love thinking about GOT but I know that most of mine and others people's theories aren't going to even fit into the jigsaw. I also think ultimately the show will come down to more human based terror than magic enduced. I think it's going to boil down to betrayal and stuff.

But for shits and giggles any thoughts on this..Could the 3ER have actually sent out the NK to do his bidding and then ultimately the NK got power hungry and decided, fuck you I'm going to take over this place.

What if the 3ER wanted them to kill Jon. In the books and the show the lead guy if those rangers in the opener of the pilot resembles Jon Snow. Some people have suggested the WW were trying to kill Jon but, in the words of Shaggy, it wasn't him.

Maybe the purpose of showing Bran the truth about Jon Snow was to try and eventually lead him to discover Jon had to die for some reason.

So what if originally the 3ER sent out (or warged) the slave of the NK to take out Jon Snow, like his version of Faceless Men. But he had just seen a vision of Jon so maybe wasn't totally sure when he'd be heading to the wall. 

What if of all Crastors children the 1 we see the NK turn in the show was the only one he did that to, to give himself an heir. And what if all the other children had been taken as blood sacrifices to the 3ER, when Bran is in there you can see skulls on the floor.

What if the NK realised how powerful he was by himself and decided to turn on the 3ER? What if that was why he killed the 3ER? 

What if originally they made a pact to ""defeat the WW"" but the pact was actually made made with the 3ER and not the NK (not sure if my timeline matches on that) ?

And what if the NK has nothing to do with prophecy and all that but that he just wants the Throne, he has an heir ready?

1-Bran. I dont like this theory. Its mainly based on the fact that Bran and the NK have the same fashion consultant. And Bran has become a bit of a cold fish since he went all three-eyed. Bran is just acting like any other social media addict who gets all detached and spaced out about the real world. I think hes the same Bran, son of Ned Stark and noble knight wannabe. I do  think Bran will end up time travel warging into some poor kid 8000 years in the past and become Bran the Builder, but thats another theory. 

2-Some yet unknown Stark in the past, maybe the first Stark. This theory is supported by the fact that Starks have warging and Greensight in their blood, and that (on steroids) is the skill set that allows the NK to do what he does. Problem with this is they only have 6 episodes left to create the NKs back story and give us a reason to care about it.

3- New theory ( unless someone has already posted this) : the Night King is the Mad King. I was just thinking, who is nasty enough and bat-shit crazy enough to want to kill the whole world and turn them into zombies? Then I remembered Bran having visions of the mad king yelling burn them all!.  That has to mean something. What if just before Jaime stuck a knife in his back Bran somehow ( from the future) managed to thrust the Mad King 8000 years back and stuff him into whoever in flesh became the Night King.  Maybe Bran will try to find out the NKs story to try to stop him, but will also be traveling to the MKs time to figure out where they hid the wildfire. Or whatever. The idea is that Bran can be a conduit throughout the history of Westeros. 

The Mad King becoming the Night King would truly be a story of fire and ice. The Mad King always hated the Starks, and wanted to have a dragon. And it would be be fitting if Dany, who always had to live with the legacy of her whack job dad, finally takes him out in the end.

Any thoughts or theories?

Now think back to what Mirri Maz Duur said: ""When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" I've read a lot about what some folks seem to think about this, but I saw something interesting on the map.

God's Eye and Dragonstone are in a nearly perfect east-west alignment. I started to think about what someone would see if they were, say, at The Isle of Faces and Dragonstone erupted. Would they think about suns setting in the east?

Or alternately, if someone was on Dragonstone and something (dunno what) happened at The Isle of Faces could that be like a sun rising in the west?

And I suppose that with enough of a geological catastrophe, one could raise some land far enough to cause the seas to run dry. The Arm of Dorne is said to be the remnants of a land bridge destroyed by the Children of the Forest. If they can do that, could they raise the land beneath the Narrow Sea? I've seen some folks speculate that the Night King could freeze the water as well, although that doesn't really appeal to me too much.

And, of course, an erupting volcano could destroy itself with enough force to end up 'blowing in the wind like leaves.' One could make the argument that the snow-like covering in Dany's House of Undying vision is actually volcanic ash. Yeah, that's snow sticking in her hair, but it could also be snowing onto ash already in place.

But mainly I was struck with the alignment of The Isle of Faces with Dragonstone and the idea that since the first pact was signed at God's Eye, that this location could feature prominently in this next seasonand Dragonstone with its volcano is exactly due east from there. And there's a prophecy concerning Dany which mentions East, West, and mountains being destroyed. Not to mention that many folks think she is pregnant. And that she is (probably) the last Targaryen and the first Targaryen conqueror set out from Dragonstone.

Not sure it qualifies as a theory, but it did seem very interesting to me. And in fairness it doesn't seem any more of a reach than some other speculations about that particular prophecy. I mean, there's clearly a lot of substance to the idea that things on this scale have happened in the past. And I do think they're gonna want to raise the bar in terms of visual spectacle, and if GoT is really (as some insist) an ecological horror story, how better to punctuate that than with a geological catastrophe?

I mean he seems to have a good heart and wants to do the right thing but everyone here seems to think he will die, Now yes that is understandable as S7 showed that he needs to get alittle better at his fighting skills but still though I don't think Podrick will die (atleast I don't want him too, even though I am 50/50 on weather or not he will/should die), But in my opinion I think there is two things I want to see from Podrick (and before he possibly dies which I don't think/want to happen) and that is we need to learn what he did to those prostitutes, and he needs his own heroic moment where he does something that shows not only has his training paid off but also something that will make viewers and the people of Westeros remember him look after the story is over.

I'm not saying he has to kill the Night King or anything or be the one to kill The Mountain or something (even though that would be cool) but I mean maybe he does something that could risk his own life in order to save somebody else or a group of people, Like maybe he risk his own life saving Sansa from a White Walker and/or a group of Wights or maybe he sacrifices himself saving Brienne from a White Walker or the Mountain or something like that, Heck maybe Arya could teach him a thing or two about water dancing (which is how I think she beat Brienne in the sparing last season, I think that Arya still remembers her classes with Syrio and I think she may have also improved her skills on the way back home from brravos) and maybe then Podrick will become a better fighter and may do something heroic to be remember for and not just being remember for his uncle Illyn.

This is more of a book theory - but with some minor rewriting could still happen in the show.



And I apologize if this is posted elsewhere on here, haven't seen it.



Redheads are kissed by fire.

This  is a statement oft-repeated throughout the books. It seems innocuous,  but since when are repeated details like this innocuous? Could be. But  not sure it is. Words have meaning in ASOIAF Winter is coming (the  threat of the NK and the WWs). Ours is the fury (perfectly descriptive  of House Baratheon). Blood and fire (Dany born through blood (natural  birth) and born through fire (when the dragons hatched and she found her  strength)) (Jon born through blood (natural birth) reborn through fire  (Melisandre)). The Lannisters always pay their debts (and so they have)  (and yes, I know those are not their house words, which is why I listed  it.) I am the king (those kings who have said that have proven  themselves unworthy and been killed.)

Anyway. So words have meanings. And redheads are kissed by fire.

Sansa  is a redhead my theory goes that Sansa will die  possibly by  Littlefinger in the books and  will be revived by Lady Stoneheart via the last kiss.  OR  killed by someone else on the show and revived by Beric Dondarrion or Melisandre on the show....

*A Storm of Swords*

*Thoros  of Myr explains to Arya Stark that he administered the last kiss to  Lord Beric Dondarrion whenBeric died after the battle at the Mummer's  Ford. The kiss revived Beric, however, much to the shock of Thoros, who  had never seen such an occurrence before and attributes the resurrection  to R'hllor.*

*A Feast for Crows*

*Thoros  tells Brienne of Tarth that when the brotherhood without banners found  the long-dead body of Catelyn Stark, he refused to perform the kiss of  life on her. Beric instead touched his lips to Catelyn's, passing the  flame of life from him to her.*

A kiss powered by Rhllor which passed the flame of life a kiss by fire.  It just seems too prominent and repeated a saying to be irrelevant.

Varys had his parts tossed in the flame and heard a voice. 

It was then repeated to him by Kinvara who knows what was said as well and it horrifies him.

Mel also said he will die in Westeros, so this might tie into what was said, possibly a horrific prophecy, which could lead to a death in Westeros.  

Dany has threatened to burn him and his relationship with her has been strained. 

So, I think the prophecy was something along the lines of: **the rest of you will burn just as these parts have one day.** Since part of him was burning at the time I think he was told the rest will join it in the end. R'hllor is a fire god after all. 

I don't know if he understood it or what he was told at the time, he might not get the language. Maybe Kinvara translated it to him when she whispered it to him. If he knows his destiny is to burn...I wonder what he would think of the dragons and Dany's threat to burn him? Also, there is wildfire under the keep so he may get it in an unexpected way.

Margaery suggests involving Loras when she's with Renly to try and get him going, and speaks to the High Sparrow about ""the desires that used to drive [her]."" She can also be seen briefly checking out several other characters throughout the show, including Olyvar in the scene where she walks in on him and Loras, and a woman in robes in the linked scene with Sansa, moments after mentioning ""pretty girls"" as a potential interest.

Firstly, when Lady Melisandre tells Varys that he is going to die. Im sure everybody immediately assumed that was going to happen. However, it is awfully close to when Daenerys tells Varys that if he ever betrays her, shell kill him. 

I think that Daenerys will kill Varys towards the end of Season 8. Most likely for doing something she told him not to do but he did anyway for the realm. This could also explain the recent stuff coming from Emilia Clarke saying that Daenerys has a bit of a messy ending to Season 8 and she hopes it doesnt ruin her character.

3. Dragon glass is known to destroy white walkers

4. What is the horn is supposed to do?

Any thoughts? My thoughts: I think the right king wants the horn. It could be that when the others were defeated, the night king was punished to go north and stay there for a 1000 years (exiled) and when he serves his terms he can come back and find dragon glass to return to life, use the horn to give life to his soldiers (the dead) by blowing into it.

\[Verse 2\]  
""The light between the trees shadowing"" might be the landscape behind the wall, but this is possibly the weakest verse qua references.

\[Bridge\]  
""Taking an oath"" might be another reference to the Night's Watch. ""The end is upon us"" can be a reference to the white walkers that come back in the winter.



Even if the song isn't about him, there are some striking similarities between Jon Snow's life and the lyrics of this song.

A few examples are;

Arya was at the crossroads when she decided to go to Winterfell instead of Kings Landing

Jaime overplayed his hand - he tried to get himself untied after saving Brienne from being raped.

Arya was blinded by revenge killing Trant.  An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.

Sansa took the leap (from Winterfell wall) and faced her fears

Lysa was standing on the edge (batshit crazy)

Cat was negotiating (for Robbs life) with cutthroats

Theon was cocky

Oberyn needed eyes in the back of his head.

Jon was lured out in the open by olly olly oxen free

Margaery was playing with fire (games with Cersei) and got burnt

Renlys death was all smoke and mirrors (he was standing in front of a mirror when the black smoke/shadow arrived) to cover that Stannis had killed him.

Stannis cast a long shadow, which led Brienne to kill him later.

 

I am pretty sure given the Mountain has a temper that his blood will boil. Also given Qyburn replaced his blood with some weird substance, my guess is the hound will put him on fire and he will burn from the inside out. So boiling liquid will come from his eyes.

Now as for Cersei; we know she has become her own worst enemy and caused her children harm with her plans. Now she will cause herself harm through one of her plans. Her plan will literally backfire. Now she could get burnt trying to burn others, but that isnt a literal backfire unless she is running and her back catches on fire. But that doesnt really follow DnDs pattern because it is literal words. Also it doesnt follow her prophecy of the valonqar, but it doesnt need to since it was left out of the show. I think that kind of death is rather non eventful to get burnt.

I believe she tries to use one of the ballistas. She was taught how to pull the lever. Most likely she has one set up in the dragonpit. At this stage Gregor is dead and she is desperate and tries to shoot Drogon and Dany (who is in the sky fighting Viserion). As she is about to pull the lever, Jaime tries to stop her by hitting the ballista tension with his sword. This causes the ballista to break and pieces fly off. Jaime ducks and when he turns he sees Cersei on the ground with a large piece of the ballista in her. It caused a backfire. She is bleeding out and losing a lot of blood. At this stage Jaime does a mercy kill and places his hands around her pale white neck (very white due to blood loss) and chokes the life from her.

But it doesnt end there. Jaime failed to stop the arrow from firing and it hits Rhaegal causing him to fall. He smashes the throne room with his tail going down and lands in the dragonpit. Because the NK is close, he reanimates and Jaime and Brienne now have to fight wight Rhaegal. After a battle they both manage to stick their swords into the dragon which kills him and both of their swords ignite with blue flame (Rhaegal now being like Viserion). This also aligns with Jaimes dream in the books. They continue to fight wights but Jaime is badly injured from Rhaegal. They manage to escape but Jaime is badly wounded and collapses. Brienne holds him as he dies. So Jaime dies as a result of Cerseis actions and fulfills Olennas prophecy that Cersei will be the end of him. They manage to kill each other.",11,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ok, Im new to this and this is my first post, but here it goes. 

I was thinking today about Ned and his admission of guilt. What effect did his admission in front of the small folk have, if any?

Considering the mistreatment of lords by a king would break the feudal agreement that they all live under. So lets say when Rickard and Brandon were killed this was seen as unjust amongst  the lords and would therefore impact their decision to join the rebels cause. 

So basically does anyone think that if Ned would not have admitted to treason would more lords have sided with Robb? And also would any of them been more reluctant to join the crown?",1,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm fairly new to the sub and the fandom and a quick search hasn't revealed if this is a common idea: Sandor is pretty obsessed with ""the gift of mercy."" I have to imagine this stems from the months and months of what is often considered the worst pain imaginable recovering from his burn as a child -- during which he probably wished over and over for that gift himself. (Pause to be sad to think of a suicidal 6 year old.)

My question is: Do we know Cersei's direct orders about what exactly Sandor is supposed to do with Mycah? Is he explicitly ordered to kill him, which seems to be what most people think and leads people to respond with ""Nuremburg""? Or was he just ordered to bring him back?

If the second -- given that he knows exactly what kind of sadistic torture Mycah would be in for from his employers, could killing him during the hunt be a form of the gift of mercy?

One of the producers left out an early copy of the plotline, take with a pinch of salt.

Beric and Tormund managed to get inland enough on top of the wall to avoid being killed. Somehow get down from the wall and lead a small party of survivors behind lines attempting to reach the Castle Black to send ravens out that the wall has been breached.  

Jump to Winterfell where the rest of them have travelled up to from White Harbor after sailing there (end of season 7). Both dragons also there. Tyrion and Sansa reunite, Jon and Arya, Jon and Sam. 

Jaime arrives at Winterfell, greeted warmly by Tyrion, with suspicion by the rest especially Dany. Explains about Cersei not actually sending men. Should be expressed like Tyrion, he does not betray Cersei completely and does not notify anyone of the Golden Company and Euron.
Short skirmish at Last Hearth, taken and army presses on to secure the rest of the wall. 

Bran summons Jon under the Weirwood tree and tells him his true ancestry, flashback to Ned and boatsex etc. Jon is unsure how he feels.
After the death of Littlefinger, Sansa ensures the Vale's leadership with Lord Royce as Robin is not old or competent enough although he will not pledge for Dany yet. 

Pressing Cersei to acknowledge the threat, Qyburn searches for places to mine dragonglass as a precaution, putting their past differences aside, he works with the maesters who have now also acknowledged the threat and send ravens to every corner of Westeros detailing the situation.

Many of the seven kingdoms in the grip of Cersei or in dissaray, no further armies are sent north at all.
In Winterfell, the lords argue about what to do, now all realising the threat and the fall of the wall which has now been taken entirely, Tormund and Beric along with all Night's Watch presumed dead. In the great hall, Dany and Jon are heckled by the Northern lords for their alliance, many saying that the King in the North should not be pledged to her. Bran announces to everyone Jon's true parentage, Sam confirms that he is not a bastard but the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms. Causes uproar, Dany is vocal and feels her claim is threatened, Jon is outed at King in the North. Sansa becomes Queen in the North and pledges to Dany.

Tyrion attempts to bring order and says that they need to plan their defence. Being the most military-minded Jaime, Jorah and Jon agree to split the forces in the North to defend in specific strongholds. 
Jaime orders all remaining forces around the Last Hearth to retreat to The Dreadfort, where he would garrison a few thousand men. Accompanied by Brienne, Podrick and Arya.

Jorah would garrison another force of a few thousand to Deepwood Motte and the Wolfswood. Accompanied by the Hound. Jon would stay in Winterfell with around 10,000 men. The remainder of the North's forces would be spread out south in places such as White Harbor to prepare for a retreat. The Vale's forces in the North would stay in Winterfell also as a response force, ready to ride out to wherever they were needed to prevent a breach in the defensive line. Dany travels to Dragonstone to oversee mining of dragonglass, leaving Varys and Tyrion in Winterfell. 

Cersei secures Dorne now that they are leaderless with the newly acquired Golden Company, shoring up her empire to 6 of the 7 kingdoms. She is more upset than angry that Jaime left her, and without his command of the armies she is worried about their performance - she is running out of competent people to trust.

Dothraki and Unsullied that were putting King's Landing under seige and repelled by the rest of the Lannister army from behind as they do not have the discipline to efficiently scout or come up with proper tactics. Grey Worm is killed in the fighting with the entire Unsullied forces. Having a means to, many Dothraki escape and attempt to ride north to meet with Dany.

Dany, tied up north cannot spare anymore forces to send south and help the Unsullied, hence their destruction. She enters a state of rage on Dragonstone hearing of the news, and with her remaining two dragons flies to King's Landing against the counsel of Tyrion and Jon in season 7 and lets forth her fire. Qyburn's scorpions are not numerous enough to land any hits and therefore much of King's Landing is burnt to the ground. Red Keep in tact and Eurons fleet was absent still sailing back from Dorne. Cersei uses this to her advantage and makes claims about Targaryen madness. Upon hearing the news, Tyrion and Varys are visibly hurt with even Jon showing signs of regret about her leadership. Deepwood Motte falls now exposing the left flank of the North, remaining garrison flee. Jorah injured.

Karhold and its tiny force falls as most had been called by Jaime.
The Dreadfort holds out in siege. Arya kills her first White Walker with her valyrian steel dagger in a raiding party outside the keep. Theory from season 7 about undead dying if their walker is proven correct again. Podrick dies after saving Brienne from being overwhelmed. Theon reaches the Iron Islands. Iron Islanders rally behind him and with newly acquired dragonglass raid the shore protecting Jorah's rear and preventing him from being overwhelmed as he retreats to Winterfell.

Dreadfort falls, all retreat to Winterfell. 
Dany returns from King's Landing to Winterfell with both dragons, met with anger from Jon and absolute hostility from Tyrion and Varys. Northern lords threaten her. Dany refuses to back down and makes a point that she would do it again.
Jorah's force reaches Winterfell with Jaime's short afterwards. 

Wight dragon appears first and is met by Dany and Jon riding Drogon and Rhaegal, lance from the Night King pierces Dany's heart, killing her and enraging her dragons. Together they disable but the Night King manages to attack Winterfell fast enough so that Jon cannot get to Visieron with dragonglass. Morale of forces is shaken and they do not hold out long against the undead.
A large army from the Vale appears with the young Robin at the request of Sansa and Royce to relieve the siege. With a final push everyone inside Winterfell push out and meet up with the Vale's forces. Winterfell is destroyed. Bran insists on being left under the Weirwood tree. Similarly to the cave with the children, none of the undead can get close and even the Night King cannot touch him. Bran explains that he can send telepathic messages to Jon etc when he needs because of the power coming from the Weirwood. 

Jon and Jaime set up splinter forces to attempt to attack the commanders while the Vale and remainder of the garrison fight. 
One force will attack from the left flank consisting of Jorah, the Hound, Arya and Brienne. The right flank consists of Jaime, Jon, and a newly joined Bronn with a small partisan force of around 100 Lannisters in a classic GOT deus ex machina.
Jaime kills a walker with his valyrian steel sword taking out a portion of the undead. Jorah and Brienne both kill walkers but it does not have enough of an effect and they all retreat, much of the Vale's forces holding up in and around the Eyrie with Davos accompanying them as a sort of ambassador to Sansa.

Dany is resurrected by the Night King and takes his place on Visieron. 
The remainder of the North also seek refuge in the Vale, using the harsh mountains to their advantage. 
The dead now march south to the Riverlands, where Cersei's armies meet them for the first time. Unprepared and unwilling, frontlines are smashed by the dead and the Dothraki hordes from the south. Dany's greatest asset was about to be added to the Night King's army as the Dothraki, without dragonglass tried to fight through the undead. This obviously ended in complete failure and the only remaining Dothraki are now those on Dragonstone with Missandei. 

The undead take significant losses as they push south, recovering in Lannister dead. 
Cersei refuses to flee to Highgarden as the dead attack King's Landing. 
North and Vale push out from the Vale into the rearguard of the dead hoping to end the war by ambushing the Night King. 
Fight to King's Landing, meet up with Lannister forces. Cersei holding up in Red Keep. Jaime, Bronn, Brienne and the Hound with a few hundred soldiers with Tyrion and Varys fight up to get in. Cersei is found cowering on the Iron Throne with the Mountain which the Hound squares up to. The Mountain kills the Hound, being killed after by Brienne and Bronn. Jaime realises Cersei's madness and paralleled to Aerys he kills her with a sword in her back, also revealing that she was never pregnant. 

Melisandre sails to Dragonstone and gets a boat with Davos to King's Landing where uses the her powers to bless or enchant the scorpion bolt, allowing the dany to be killed, as she is still resistant to fire after being resurrected. Visieron is disabled by Jon riding Rhaegal and Drogon is used extensively to batter down the undead. After taking the Red Keep, the Lannister armies rally behind Tyrion and Jaime and manage to take out a large portion of the undead, with raids from Jorah and Jon killing some of the commanders. The Night King makes a fatal error and succumbs to his anger and rides a now recovered Visieron directly into the red keep, and as per her prophecy Melisandre dies along with Varys at the hands of the Night King himself in the chaos. The Night King links up with a substantial force of undead and pushes further into the keep. Bran connects with Jon to help with strategy as he has now exceeded by far the old 3er's powers. Bran is using the Weirwood tree to interfere with the Night King and his commanders, similar to how a dog dislikes high frequencies. This throws the Night King off balance and a now dissolved undead force allows Arya to use her valyrian steel dagger to slowly kill the commanders one by one. 

She stabs the Night King in the heart and he shatters. 
The undead immediately fall to bones and blow away like dust in the wind. 
Being next in line to the throne, King Jaime of House Lannister's first commands are for the two remaining dragons to vapourise the Iron Throne. 

The Queen in the North, Jon, Tyrion, Jaime and most of the other lords agree that the monarchy should be abolished, and the Crownlands become the possession of Aegon Targaryen. 
Each of the kingdoms become totally independent, Aegon (Jon) King of the Crownlands, Sansa as Queen of the North, Robin as King of the Vale, a restored Edmure and his son King of the Riverlands, Jaime and Tyrion jointly rule the Westerlands, Samwell Tarly King of the Reach, A recovered Yara rules the Iron Islands after Euron's death at King's Landing, Gendry, Robert's bastard is legitimised and becomes King of the Stormlands and Dorne elects to rule in a committee.

In the Citadel scene when the maesters are reading Wolkin's (wokest) warning, the closing comments and their proximity to Jon's true name (Aegon) being revealed just 2 episodes later seem to foreshadow that Euron will be the one to kill Jon Snow.

Ah Lodock... RIP Jon.

In her vision, Dany sees the iron throne, she reached for it, but then decided to go north of the wall and found Khal Drogo with her son.

I think the first part already happened:

Dany had the opportunity to seized the throne, by fighting Cersei, but decided to go North instead, to help Jon fight the Night King.

So, maybe the second part of the vision will happen in season 8 and Daenarys will joined Drogo and her son, by dying, because she decided to go North.

However some people still believe another shipping will happen....that shipping is JONSA aka Jon/Sansa so today I am going to explain why Jon/Sansa will not happen in the story and will NOT be endgame in the show or books, let's begin.

Okay so the first big thing is that Jon and Sansa were raised believing they were brother and sister meaning that there marriage would be pretty weird and awkward, Not to mention I don't think Jon will want to marry someone he believed to be his sister for years. Another thing is that the people who ship this pairing claim it would parallel Ned and Catelyn but first of all Ned and Cat were never raised believing they were Brother and Sister and secondly not everything has to parallel each other exactly, The scene where Jon strangles LF in S7 I think was just simply a coincidence that it was similar to Ned strangling LF in S1 and also I think that not only meant to show that Jon does not care what LF thinks but also that if it was out of love it was non-incestuous family love, as in he was just trying to protect his sister.

Also it does not fit with the idea of a Song of Ice and Fire or a Stark/Targaryen alliance as Jon is still somewhat a Stark. Jon and Sansa have been through a lot and have survived but so has Daenerys and pretty much most of the characters in the story for that matter. Also you could argue the scenes in S6 between Jon and Sansa may have set this up but I don't think that was the intention also yes Jon left to fight Ramsey and take back WF because of Sansa but it was not out of romantic love but family love, Finally I don't think D&amp;D were ever going to have Jon and Sansa be a thing, if they were going to (or at the very least have a love triangle between Jon, Sansa, and Daenerys) they would've been a lot more forshadowing and set up for it very early on in S7 and also through out S7 like idk maybe in one of the scenes between Jon and Sansa before the scene ends Sansa look longingly into Jon's eyes or something and also maybe when LF mentions Jon and Dany being young and single he could also bring up to Sansa she is young and single as well. But they didn't do any thing like that which leads me to believe it is not the intention.

Now yes I will admit I use to be a Jonsa shipper myself, However I quickly retired from it after S7 because I knew it was a lost cost as it was not where the story was going. Also looking back on it the shipping itself was just silly, Like why would Jon marry a woman he saw as his sister all his life (which is the same reason why I don't support the Jon/Arya shipping as well). As for the books, Well if Sansa marries a Targaryen in the books it's probably going to be Young Griff/Aegon but that's my personal opinion.",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Lets go shall we??

* Daenerys never had a home and a family, but she had a name, a very important name that brought her some good things and some bad things, but her life was pretty much defined by that name; Jon Snow in the other hand, never had a name but he did had a home and a family that loved him dearly and the relationship he formed in that family and the values his Stark father passed to him did shape him to be the man he is today defining him in the same way that Daenerys's name defined her. 

* One was defined by their family name; the other by their family actions. 

* in season 1 Jon Snow joined the Night Watch, where he learned how to serve, he was literally cleaning toilets; Dany was made Queen in season 1, she had servants and maids and was learning how to give orders;

* Jon Snow was named Lord Commader and KITN, power is giving to him by his peers and Lords of the North, he never seeks power, yet they keep on giving to him; Daenerys seeks power during her all journey in the books, and she uses her dragons to achieve this power. She conquers cities and forces the Masters of Meereen to proclaim her as their queen.

* One is leading his people to safety, Jon brought the Wildlings south od the Wall to save them from the NK;  Daenerys  is dragging her people over the ocean so that she can be a queen. The dothraki and Unsulied are now less safe because of Daenerys decision to bring them to Westeros.

* One is using her followers for a personal goal, the other is leading his followers to save their lives. (huuuuuu)

* One never ask people to bend their knees to him; the other will burn you alive if you refuse do it. 

* One always believed to be a bastard, with no name and believes to not be entitled to anything; the other can not stop saying her stupid name and believes to be entitled to all 7 kingdoms (oooops!!!!). 

* One is humble; the other is very arrogant. 

* Jon Snow words that guide him through this story are  **""I am the shild that guards the realms of men""** ; Daenerys words she keeps on repeating over and over is **""I take whats is mine with fire and blood""**.

They could not be more different from each other actually, which was what D&amp;D tried to tells us in the scene where they first meet. Daenerys repeated her stupid list of names, while Jon simply presented himself as KITN. Which is why we will have a second Dance of Dragons in season 8.

He was incredibly cunning and I was so sure it'd be him, Dany(with Varys's backing), Jon and Cersei vying for the throne in the final season. I liked the subtle plays for power by each character and how it varied along a spectrum. From completely overt(Dany) to covert (LF and Varys) to a combination of the two in Cersei and a new dimension of just knowing nothing and it being thrust upon him. Of the four candidates for the throne, LF never got a chance to overtly use his full strength in service of his purpose, and that's a damn shame. I imagined he'd have an army and stronghold while still playing the game and bringing disorder to the plans of his foes. For some reason he stayed in the shadows, wasting a lifetime of maneuvering up the ladder from the chaos he inflicted. As if he were to throw away a life aspiration to chase a Cat lookalike and being a pheux-warden of the north, as if that was a substitution or step toward being the ruler of the seven kingdoms. Varys said LF was one of the most dangerous men in the seven kingdoms but that never truly came into fruition. In an alternative universe where LF had his amry at his back and used the full capability of his cunning and strength to be a true antagonist only falling short to the NK, I imagine a much different, and maybe more interesting story playing out.

hey folks, this is just what i think might happen in the show in season 8.



cersei might go north to fight the undead army after winterfell has fallen.



probably the final stand could be in the eyrie.



remember that littlefinger and sansa murdered lysa arryn, the mother of robyn.



cersei might use this knowledge to turn robyn against sansa, and this might turn robyn to pledge alliance to cersei.



i think that by the time northern army and dany's armies reach eyrie, cersei might already be there.



they could probably make warplans together- jon,cersei,jaime,dany,tyrion,sansa,etc all sitting in one wartable and discussing warplans. probably these scenes could be awesome.

such scenes would make more awesome than the warscenes itself.



i think that the combined armies of cersei,jon and dany might defeat the undead army.



i think after the battle is over by episode 4, then the game of thrones begins.

expect betrayal from tyrion in this regard.

probably euron might be the final villain in game of thrones.



in the books, euron is portrayed as a terrifying darklord who is seeking bloodsacrifice to conjure up his mythical ironborn diety.

probably euron might use the wildfire to blow up kingslanding to perform his massive bloodsacrifice.

To be very honest, we only saw both of the battle in only one scene. And we have heard a lot about them from Brandon Stark (who was told by his father Eddard Stark), and from Jorah Mormont (about Ser Barriston).
Well in my opinion the fight between Ser Arthur and Ned and his companions was far better. I guess this is because worriers in Ned's team were quite better than those of Son's of Harpy. Well Son's of Harpy also by very large in number and there was only Gray worm and Ser Barriston fighting. *And in my opinion the biggest factor was old age*.

Of course these are not the only one who are great fighter. The most insane one is well everyone know **Ser Gregor""the mountain"" Clegane**. The one who won one of the best fight in GoT(Well the red viper was of course silly but anyway). Ser Gregor is maybe the only one who can behead someone completely barehanded (I am not talking about Oberyn Martell, I am talking about that stupid faith militant). He is clearly the most in-human character. 

Now The mountain's brother, **Ser Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane**. He is very much human in comparison to his brother, but only in the second half of GoT. Over the period he is one of the most changed person. Now on his fighting skills, in these 7 seasons we get to know that he is quite good at killing. Only get defeated once by the Lady. In first season we see him in a single combat with is brother and they looked equally powerful. 

Now next should be the Lady. Yaas I mean **Lady Brienne of Tarth**. Needs no introduction. I would only say that she defeated The Hound and Ser Loras Tyrell(who defeated the Mountain) in single combats. Well got defeated profoundly by Arya but still she **The** strongest woman in Westeros. 

Now next is **Ser Jaime ""The kingslayer""  Lannister**. *(with both hands of course)* Well he is the most changed person over the period. From throwing Bran to saving Brienne, we have seen him evolve over the period as a person. Anyways he is very good with the sword in his hand and he was named lord commander of kingsguard for that reason. We got to see him fight against Ned Stark which was one of the best fight in all 7 seasons. He is a very skilled commander at war as well. 

I have to mention him although I don't think he could even make to top 20 in books but in GoT **Ser Loras ""Knight of the flowers"" Tyrell** is the only one to defeat The Mountain and make it out alive. 

The man who we probably saw fight most in all seasons is **Ser Jorah Mormont** from killing Khal Drogo's blood rider to saving Dany multiple times. He is probably not the best but he had made this far which is as we all know not easy at all. 

Now well no one can forget this man **Lord Eddard Stark**. We mostly heard talking about his honarable character. We saw him fight only once in season 1 and then against sword of the morning. I wanted to see him fight more but anyways moving on. 

Now **Prince Oberyn ""Red Viper of Dorne Martell**, as Cersie said ""I haven't seem anyone use that spear like him, he almost defeated Ser Gregor"" but the most childish mistake in all 7 seasons and he is dead now so end of discussion on his part. 

The free folk **Tormund Giantsbane** only thing I want to say on his part is his own words ""I am good at killing"" when Sandor asked him ""how a man like you made it this far"". 

Now another character who I did not expect would make it this far is **Ser Bronn of The Blackwater**. First defeated the Knight of Vale (whose name I don't remember). Then saved the Lannister brothers multiple times. He said it many times that he works only for gold but tbh i fell he is better than that. 

Now the most beloved character **Jon Snow** the white wolf or I might say **Aegon Targaryen** or may be **998th Lord commander of the Night's watch**. He is (almost sure) Azor Ahai or the prince who was promised. He is the one of the two alive who have killed a *White Walker*. If I am not wrong he has actually killed 2 white walkers already. And as Ramsey said ""I have heard you are probably the best swordsman ever walked"" 

Now my personal favourite character**Arya Stark**. *No One*. We have seen her defeating Lady Brienne and killing the Bravosi girl. Not to mention the doom of House Frey single handedly. I can bet that no one on her killing list will survive season 8. 

*Torgo Nudho*. **Grey Worm** as he said he is the bravest and deserving commander of *The Unsullied Army*. 

Another man from Essos. The man with a great swagger. **Darrio Naharis**. Proved his greatest in many battle specially when Ser Jorah , Grey worm and Darrio fought in Meereen.



Now there are few more people we have heard about but never actully see them fight(which is such a pity). So those worriers are:
1. **Robert Baratheon** the fat king.
2. **Khal Drogo**. I can't consider a weapon less fight which eventually lead to his undesirable end. 
3. **Serio Forel**. I added him here because no matter what he was defeated by Ser Meryn Trant and he was armless so I can't consider that fight as well. 






Now the greatest warrior list according to me :-

1. **Ser Arthur Dayne**
2. **Ser Barriston Selmy**
3. **Ser Gregor Clegane**
4. **Khal Drogo**
5. **Arya Stark**
6. **Lady Brienne of Tarth**
7. **Ser Sandor Clegane**
8. **Ser Jaime Lannister**
9. **Jon Snow**
10. **Oberyn Martell**

hey folks, i was thinking.



would cersei go to the eyrie with her amies after she learns that winterfell is destroyed??



there's robyn arryn there.

she could tell him how sansa and LF were involved in his mother's death.



i was thinking like this...

cersei along with her armies approach the eyrie and with the permission of the vale enter it.



cersei desperately wants to meet robyn but robyn is busy playing with bow and arrow.

except that none of his arrows reach the target even closely. remember his shooting skills in season 6?lol

then cersei comes forward, gently tocuhes his arms, balances his posture, and tada! the arrow hits the bulls eye.



this leaves a good impression on robyn arryn.

then they begin to have a conversation.

cunning cersei shifts the topic about his mother.. ( motherhood is the character arc of cersei as well).

then she tells him how his mommy died.

i know my imagination has run wild, i know right?





anyway what do you think about this??

is a lannister-vale alliance possible??

He took down the copper looking leaves that wrapped around the columns and instead added spikes and torches as well as changed out the stain glass windows for something more intimidating. 

This is one of the smaller things that Joffery did in Season 2 that really bothered me, but most of all it just served to underscore how terrible Joffery was at diplomacy. Clearly, that was the point, but damn it all. The throne room set up (presumably by Robert Baratheon) to serve implicitly as a warm and welcoming place for its many visitors of which most were not enemies of, but servants and messengers. It helped take the edge off of meeting with people in high places and allowed for more productive talks with the people who were currently in it. Then Joffrey came along and was like, ""Nope, don't need that. I'm a big bad conqueror and I want people to know it."" It's doubtful he ever understood the importance of keeping the peace and holding the 7 kingdoms together, and this was just one of so many many signs that he was unfit for the job.

Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest. It always seemed like one of the small things that are rarely discussed.",4,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

He adds that the dead cannot pass it, and that he himself cannot pass it, either. 

Now I've watched season seven so I know his fate. But, is there more to Benjen than what is revealed in the series? It seems to be hinting that he isn't really alive. I really have a feeling we haven't seen the last of him, yet. ",14,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have watched my YouTube subscriptions, I've dabbled in some Netflix, but now I'm hungry for a plate of great, long term storytelling. I've been told GoT has that, so I think it is time.

I'm currently downloading HBO Now on my phone to sign up and watch, however, I do have one concern. I hear the storytelling is great, that ANY character can die at ANY time (which I love), but if I'm correct, the show has a medieval vibe/tone to it. Is this true? I've never really been into that type of time period when watching shows or movies and that's mainly the reason why I haven't watched it sooner.

The other two times the app crashed so I hold myself short!

Ok one meister was able to create enough dragon fire to blow up almost all lf kingslanding.

Then, following this logic, all the meisters in westeros and the south should be able to create enough dragon fire to blow up the army of dead.

They simply just need to burry one barrel every 5 meters or so over the length of the wall.

Another methode would be to use the combined force of all the soilders currently in westeros to create artificial cannels over the length of the wall.
They just need to build that in a way, that would force the army of the dead to go through a narrow passage. They they burry thousands of tonnes of dragon fire.

Then when almlst all of the army of dead are above that, archers ignite the barrels with fire arrows. For an even better affect they can pour dragon fire on the ground everywhere. When the barrels get ignited this would create a carpet of fire.


Well but I am afraid they will just try to fight them one on one or try to sneak up on the nightking and white walker to kill them first becausr that would be as affective as my strategy. (But I kninda wanted to see the world burn a lil :) )",10,0,False,self,,,,,

1-correct me if i'm wrong but no one from cersei's delegation was expecting proof of the ww. so euron under normal circumstances(they have no reason to expect a real undead warrior on their back yard) had no reason for abandoning cersei. To me it looks like the real deal. He was really scared.
2-Why not just make truce. no one was expecting her to fight. by committing herself, she just provoke dany and jon plus make her (cersei) true ambitions known.
3- why did she tell jaime about it? more to the point, why did she let him live. by letting him leave, all her plans goes to trash.

So, i believe that cersei was lying when she was telling what she has 20k mercenaries, euron's ship, and shit load of gold. why, you ask? possibly for 2 reasons; first is that she is just planting false flags about her intentions just to mess with the opponents head, second is that she is just crazy as they come. just lost it. She could not fathom the fact that euron could leave her so she just goes batshit crazy.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9agf5h/spoilers_the_greatest_warriors_in_the_game_of/?utm_source=reddit-android

I guess I know why they did so. I just represented a list of warriors without any clearly and proper criteria. Sp now let me try once more. In a more proper way. 



**Thing to keep in mind before going through the list.:**
 Warriors should be considered on there peak. 
 Only the once who ever appeared on the show. 




&gt; *Based on RAW STRENGTH*:




1. **Ser Gregor Clegane**
2. **Tormund Giantsbane**
3. **Euron Greyjoy**
4. **king Robert Baratheon**
5. **Ser Sandor Clegane**
6. **Khal Drogo**
7. **Lady Brienne of Tarth**
8. **Lord Eddard Stark**
9. **Lord Rendall Tarly**
10. **Yara Greyjoy**

- Well there is one more who has more strength than any of these is **Wun Wun** the giant but since we cannot compare him with any of these so didn't include him. 



&gt;*Based on SPEED*:




1. **Syrio Forel**
1. **Arya Stark**
1. **Ser Arthur Dayne**
1. **Ser Jaime Lannister**
1. **Prince Oberyn Martell**
6. **Darrio Naharis**
7.  **Ser Barristan Selmy**
8. **Ser Bronn of the Blackwater**
9. **Khal Drogo**
10. **Lord Eddard Stark** 


- Well I think Arya and Syrio are much faster but there will be many disputes if I make them faster that Ser Arthur Or Ser Jaime Or Prince Oberyn. So I thought I should place them all on 1. 
- On Ned Stark, well all saw in season 1 that he was equally fast as Ser Jaime and not very slower than Ser Arthur. 
- I placed 5 people on number 1 but they are actually in chronological order but so slight difference that I thought better to place them all on 1. 




&gt;*Based on SKILL*:
1. **Ser Arthur Dayne**
1. **Ser Barristan Selmy**
3. **Ser Jaime Lannister**
4. **Prince Oberyn Martell**
5. **Khal Drogo**
6. **Lady Brienne of Tarth**
6. **Jon Snow**
8. **Grey Worm**
8. **Arya Stark**
8. **Syrio Forel**




- I didn't mention Robb Stark because GRRM once mentioned that Robb is maybe the best war commander but not one of the best warrior with sword. 
- I think Syrio Forel and Arya are now pretty much of same skill sets that is why I placed them both on 8. 
- There is very slight differences between top 5, but the once above, I think have got some edge better than the once below them. 






&gt;*Based on PRESENCE OF MIND DURING BATTLE*:


Well I won't rate anyone on this basis I'll just give the names. 

**Arya Stark**
**Lady Brienne of Tarth**
**Ser Bronn of the Blackwater**
**Ser Jaime Lannister**
**Jon Snow**
**King Robb Stark**
**Ser Jorah Mormont**
**Grey worm**
**Darrio Naharis**





- Well first thing is I didn't include the once who were back stabbed. Like Ned, Ser Arthur
- I didn't include the once who knew they were gonna die but still fought. Like Ser Barristan, Ned, Syrio. 
- I think I may have forgotten some names so please correct me there. 










&gt;**TAKING ALL THESE POINTS IN MIND THE GREATEST WARRIORS IN THE GAME OF THRONES**:
1. **Ser Arthur Dayne**
2. **Ser Jaime Lannister**
3. **Ser Barristan Selmy**
4. **Khal Drogo**
5. **Prince Oberyn Martell**
6. **Arya Stark**
7. **Darrio Naharis**
8. **Lady Brienne of Tarth**
9. **Jon Snow**
10. **Syrio Forel**




- Thanks for reding this far. 
- There is non of my personal favourites. All of them are according to there skill sets. I ranked them on some particular criteria then ranked them overall. 
- Everyone fell free to defy me on any point. 
- I would like if you give your opinion on any of the lists.  
- I would be glad if you appreciate it. 
-P.S. - this list is in accordance to many persons judgements from my last post

After 70 seconds of a 100-second video, we see Jon Snow at Winterfell. At the 71st second, we see Sansa hugging Jon and at the 72nd, we see Sansa giving anaggressive death-stare, in my opinion, to whoever it is standing some distance behind Jon.

That stare has made me curious.

That hug has made me curious.

Today Im going to tell you my theory behind that stare that has quickly taken the social media by a storm.

Now Ive a couple of theories, while one is pretty conservative, the other might seem radical to some.

Before going any further, I must tell you that one part of my *theories* will be the same. Its this- Sansa is staring at Dany and Bran and Sam will tell Sansa about Jons true lineage before Jon arrives at Winterfell.   


## 1. Long Live the King!

My first theory goes like this- Sansa will come to know about Jons true parentage and how hes her cousin, Aunt Lyannas and Rhaegar Targaryens son, which makes him the true heir to the Iron Throne.***An opposition to Danys claim!***

Lets think about what the North, and especially Sansa must think of the Targaryens- conquerers, dangerous, dragon-riders, not trustworthy, unkind, MAD! and KILLERS! We also know that the Northerners weren't really supportive of Jon's decision to go to Dragonstone. 

Sansa, like everyone else, knows about what the Mad King was saying before he died,***Burn them all!*** and while different people have different theories about**all,** most of Westeros, like the Kingslayer Jamie Lannister, believes he was referring to the normal people. I also believe that Sansa and the North must know about Randall Tarlys and his son Dickons execution. Execution by Dragonfire. Executed by Dany.

I believe that Sansa must think of them as people who,

1. do anything they want to do; (because, well, dragons) and

2. kill anyone who stands in their way i.e The Starks before and the Tarlys now. 

According to my first theory, once Sansa will realisewho Jon really is, she will be happy. I mean, why not? Her cousin may become the King when the dust settles. But, given the past and recent history of the Targaryens, she will also be concerned about Jons well being. Whos to say Dany wont kill him off to get the throne shes always wanted? is what she may think.

Sansa has already said that she considers Jon a Stark, once she realises that he is, in fact, a half-Stark, her affection for him can only grow, just like her concerns for him.

So my first theory gives the conclusion that that stare, is a look a sister will most likely give to someone who might want to kill her brother.

## 2. Ice and Fire?

For this theory, we have to go back to when we first heard about the original script and story by GRRM. In the original story, there was supposed to be a love-triangle between Jon. Tyrion and Arya. This didnt happen in the show. I dont think Arya and Tyrion have ever even had any conversations on the show, let alone love.

But, Sansa has had conversations with Tyrion. Sansa was even married to Tyrion. And Tyrion liked and respected Sansa for the little girl she was at the time.

Are you paying attention? Stay with me, this will get more interesting as you read ahead.

My question is, what if D&amp;D made a slight change to the original script? What if they replaced Arya with Sansa.

Ask yourself, what has Sansa always wanted? ***To rule.***

Can she ever rule the seven kingdoms under the present circumstances? Can she become queen? 

Under normal circumstances, probably not.

I think most of Westeros believes that either Cersei will continue to rule or  Dany or Jon will take the iron throne in the future once the Great War ends. Sansa has an outside shot if everyone else dies.

But at that moment, the moment when she hugged Jon, something that has only happened once before and under completely different circumstances, she may have something different in mind.

Think about it this, what reason could Sansa have to initiate a hug? She was kept in the dark about the whole 'knee-bending' thing and she didn't like the fact that she wasn't consulted on it. You could say that it was just out of some sibling-love or maybe 'half'-sibling. 

But can there be another reason?

What if when Sam and Bran tell her about Jon, she sees an opportunity? An opportunity to be Queen. Sansa, along with her mother, was the only Stark who cared nothing for Jon back in S1. She even apologised to him for her behaviour when they met in S6 back at Castle Black.

So we can admit that Sansas and Jons brother-sister relationship was and has never been the same as Jons and Aryas.

My theory is when Sansa will realise the Jon is a Targaryen, she would try and woo him afterwards. Now Im not sure if cousin-cousin marriage is accepted in Westeros but it sure wont be as radical and controversial as the Cersei-Jamie relationship.

A Stark and a Targaryen! Oh, we have seen this before! Thats how it started and that is how it may end. We think of Jon as Ice and Dany as Fire but now we know that Jon is a Targaryen, so shouldnt he be Fire too?What if Jon is Fire and Sansa is Ice?

Also, remember all the parallels being drawn between Sansa and Cersei? Their personalities among other things? She admits to Jon in S7 that she has learned a lot from Cersei.Jon even think that Sansa admires her. 

What if she is like her in more than some ways?

Do you remember whom Cersei wanted to marry? ***Rheagar Targaryen****.* 

Who is Jon? ***Rhaegars son.***

So, my second theory concludes that that look, a sudden and aggressive look, while hugging aloved one at the same time, was a look of jealousy and competitiveness.

Sansa will know that Dany, the beautiful Dany, may be the only obstacle between her and the throne room.

Littlefinger did tell Sansa about Dany's beauty and how Jon may want to form to an alliance by marrying her. Sansa will surely remember that. 

P.S- This all may seem ridiculous but I just wanted some thoughts as I couldn't get that scene out of my head.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if it's the opposite? What if Jaime is what brings Bran Stark, the boy who loved to climb, out into the front of the Three-Eyed Raven's mind? Including his dreams, anger, sense of loss and sadness. 

Bran's personality and emotions aren't totally lost, it's like they're coming back bit by bit - like how he didn't hug Sansa but then hugged Arya later, didn't thank Meera but then thanked Sam later. The previous Three-Eyed Raven seemed to be able to express emotions, like his tone of weariness and wisdom, his worry regarding Bran reaching young Ned and the visible sadness/fear of his own death. Thus, it seems to me that Bran's persona is floating about, but, like his predecessor's, will recover in due course, once he can get a hold of ""The Sight"". 

Jaime may have indirectly set the path for the Three-Eyed Raven's future, but he destroyed Bran's. Hence, I have a strong feeling that Bran won't react well to Jaime's presence. At all. Plus, let's not forget Bran's part in executing Bailish, with the visions and dagger (it almost seemed like he knew what would happen when he handed it to Arya). I'm not saying Jaime will be subject to a similar fate, but perhaps Bran - and the Starks - won't be nearly as forgiving as everyone thinks... ",16,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sorry, I'm new here and I didnt know y'all did a weekly rewatch, but I wanna raise something I noticed in S5e04 (sons of the harpy). Melisandre tells stannis she served ""the true Lord"" or something similarly vague, then tries to seduce Jon Snow immediately afterward. Last time she got knocked up it ended with us short one Baratheon Brother. Do y'all think she knew he was Targaryen? I think she was trying to seduce him to perform some magic and he turned her down.

So in the middle of the series I realized that I have the list of names, I want the story tellers to kill. So just like Arya has her own list of names, I do too (for the characters of the series). Thankfully, half of the job is done and only the future will show who will fall and who will stay standing. 

Let me know who are your favorite ones and who you would get rid off first! 

And this is my list:

1. ~~Joffrey~~ 
2. Cersei
3. ~~Little finger~~
4. ~~Olly (Night's watch)~~
5. Theon Greyjoy
6. ~~Ramsay Bolton~~
7. The Red Witch (after the last seasons I'm about to get her off the list, so if she remains cool, she might get away unharmed lol)
8. ~~Stannis Baratheon~~

We all know there are 3 ways to kill White Walkers.  Dragonglass, Valyrian steel, and Fire.  But is there a 4th way?  Yes, there is.  Sound!

Sound waves of a certain frequency will shatter and destroy White Walkers.  How do we know this?  Because it has already been shown in Season 7 Episode 6.  Jon Snow and company travel beyond the wall in order to capture a White Walker.  On their journey, they encounter an isolated group of wights along with their White Walker leader.  As Jon Snow slays the leading White Walker, multiple wights spontaneously disintegrate with him.

Upon their journey home, Jorah Mormont comments about how the wights suddenly died as their leader was destroyed, to which Jon Snow replied, ""Maybe he was the one who turned them.""

While this seems like a reasonable explanation for the wights' deaths, something else occurred at that very moment which seems to have been overlooked.  Just before slaying the White Walker, Jon Snow's sword clashed with the sword of the White Walker, emitting an unusually high-pitched sound wave.

I believe it was this sound wave which killed the wights and not some connection to their leader.  Why do I think this?

For starters, a connection to their leader implies some sort of field which links them together.  Your typical field, such as an electromagnetic field travels at the speed of light.  Assuming the White Walkers ""field"" behaves similar to an electromagnetic field, the wights would have disintegrated instantaneously and simultaneously.  But this in not what happened.  There was a small time delay and they disintegrated sequentially, one after another.  This implies a slower moving force, such as that of a sound wave.

The second reason I believe this has to to do with the timing of the series.  The 8th and final season is approaching, yet the war with the White Walkers has not even begun.  But who cares about the White Walkers?  The real battle that everyone cares about is between Cersei Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen.  In order to make room for this epic battle, the White Walkers will need to be defeated quickly and easily.  What simpler way to defeat the White Walkers than with sound waves, a method which will most likely be discovered within an ancient scroll read by Samwell Tarley.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

While this seems like a reasonable explanation for the wights' deaths, something else occurred at that very moment which seems to have been overlooked.  Just before slaying the White Walker, Jon Snow's sword clashed with the sword of the White Walker, emitting an unusually high-pitched sound wave.

I believe it was this sound wave which killed the wights and not some connection to their leader.  Why do I think this?

For starters, a connection to their leader implies some sort of field which links them together.  Your typical field, such as an electromagnetic field travels at the speed of light.  Assuming the White Walkers ""field"" behaves similar to an electromagnetic field, the wights would have disintegrated instantaneously and simultaneously.  But this in not what happened.  There was a small time delay and they disintegrated sequentially, one after another.  This implies a slower moving force, such as that of a sound wave.

The second reason I believe this has to to do with the timing of the series.  The 8th and final season is approaching, yet the war with the White Walkers has not even begun.  But who cares about the White Walkers?  The real battle that everyone cares about is between Cersei Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen.  In order to make room for this epic battle, the White Walkers will need to be defeated quickly and easily.  What simpler way to defeat the White Walkers than with sound waves, a method which will most likely be discovered within an ancient scroll read by Samwell Tarley.",16,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In Season 6 Episode 9 Tyrion says that House Greyjoy's ships and the ships they took from the slaver's will be enough to transport the Dothraki and Unsullied to Westeros. 

Since Dany has enough ships for her army she would set sail and leave Meereen. It would be impractical for the ships of the Tyrells and Martells to sail to Meereen to meet her so we can assume that the final scene of Season 6 takes place near the coast of Dorne. 

If Dany already had enough ships for her army with the help of the Tyrells and the Martells we know that those ships aren't carrying her army, so who are they carrying? It's clearly not the armies of House Tyrell and House Martell because in Season 7 those armies are still in the Reach and Dorne and Dany has to sens part of her fleet to go get them.

With that in mind, George is now operating with what I can only presume is carte blanche with regard to ASOIAF. From our outsider's perspective, it would seem to me that he has himself in an even deeper rabbit hole than he did with AFFC/ADWD. With George in this state, is it even reasonable to expect that he can recapture the genius of the original three books in TWOW? From my perspective, I have a very hard time believing that, should some miracle happen and TWOW eventually sees the light of day, that it's not another disappointment.

hey folks, intially melisandre thought that stannis is the prince that was promised(PTWP) who would lead westeros to victory against the forces of darkness.



the reason why she thught so was because she **supposedly saw stannis baratheon in the flames leading the fight against the undead.**



thats she had an almost fantical faith that stannis is actually the one true king and PTWP.



now with the death of stannis, her faith is shattered and although she thinks jon snow is PTWP, she doesnt actually believe it.



my question is, did she actually saw somebody else??

did her original vision showed her somebody else??

might have mel mistook someone else for stannis??



if so, who might have been that guy?

the obvious candidate for this is gendry.

see, his haircut in season7. **exactly the same haircut of stannis in season 5!**



also, baratheons look a lot alike, so she might have actually seen gendry but mistook him for stannis.

may be show saw the baratheon symbol in gendry and mistook him for stannis.



also, if gendry is the son of cersei, he is the one true heir to the iron throne.

this coincides with melisandre's once held belief that stannis is the one true king.



what do you think, folks??



game of thrones is not predictable.

grrm may decide to give the title of PTWP to a guy who until then had a minor role to play in the series. it is probable.",16,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the show, whenever we see the Walkers they are accompanied by an aura of extreme cold, darkness, and windy whiteout blizzards. Jon aptly says of the Night King, ""he brings the storm."" Here's why I think there may be a different explanation.

I don't believe there ever been a time where we were shown for sure that winter is caused by the White Walkers. After all, they've existed in the Lands of Always Winter for eight thousand years, and winters have come and gone since then as normal. This current winter is unique in that the magic they are fueled by is stronger than ever before, and has amplified them (and winter). They do not cause winter per se.

I believe that the White Walkers are ""following"" the magical aura of Winter (Great Other) that is converging on the world. Another way to look at is when it's summer, the magic of the Lord of Light converges on the world, bringing heat and sunny weather.

When dragons came back into the world, the scales of magical power were tipped and as a result this winter will be more severe, to balance things out again. The White Walkers are simply riding the wave, having bided their time for 8000 years and now being strong enough to attack. They had to wait for winter to come and the Great Other's magic to be stronger, and it's worked out quite well so far (RIP Viserion and Wall).

I have a feeling that if they were able to bring the Wall down in the Summer it would be a *very* different story. Presumably, they could. It's still cold North of the Wall, and wights/White Walkers don't decompose or melt that we know of. The mortal army would have visibility and not have to deal with the cold and hunger that comes during winter conditions. If only that could be the case.

Unfortunately we're in another Long Night now so we don't have those advantages. Food, cold and morale will all be huge issues. But I really believe the army of the living can still roll over the AotD with coordination and discipline. Just imagine burning hay balls like in Troy, fire catapults, wildfire traps set at strategic choke points, and armies in formation with proper weapons. And their trump card, the dragons.

They have a strong chance, if they whittle away at them and then just do a full strength charge straight for the Night King.

There are all sorts of rumours relating to tidbits from the books, ideas about the Night King and hopes for twists and turns which will genuinly catch us by surprise but how much can really be acomplished in 6 hours of TV? Consider what we can expect.

1. Episode 1 will be a 'setting the table' episode, All the remaining 'story' characters will get scenes which begins their final arcs. That's got to cover Jon, Dany, Tyrion, The Night King (we'll, at least, have to see what he's doing), Bran, Sansa, Arya, the Hound, Jamie, Cersai, Theon, Melisandra and Varys (what the red priestess said to him in season 6 needs to be resolved).
2. Episode 5 will almost certainly be the 'big' battle between the living and the dead and will almost certainly have the whole episode dedicated to it.
3. Episode 6, as the concluding episode, won't have any plot, it will just be pay off  for all the various story lines.

That means we've only got three episodes of story to play with and we can expect at least one major set piece in them so, conservatively, we've got 2 and a half hours of plot, that's not a long time to cover everything that needs to be covered let alone introduce new ideas.

So what do you all think? Will S8 just be about ticking boxes about everything we've seen so far or do you think there's time for interesting story telling and new ideas?",45,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

Thing is, he was murdered for doing the right thing, and as you might expect that shook him to his core. I think Kit Harrington did a fine job of portraying that uncertainty following his resurrection. The last few episodes of season 7 demonstrated Jon finding his footing again, by identifying himself repeatedly as his fathers son. His real father, Ned Stark. He declared his allegiance to his fathers values and worldview in the dragon pit and again when telling Theon to man up and save his sister.

Thing is, he was murdered for doing the right thing, and as you might expect that shook him to his core. I think Kit Harrington did a fine job of portraying that uncertainty following his resurrection. The last few episodes of season 7 demonstrated Jon finding his footing again, by identifying himself repeatedly as his fathers son. His real father, Ned Stark. He declared his allegiance to his fathers values and worldview in the dragon pit and again when telling Theon to man up and save his sister.

Everyone's pointed out the whole ""first child"" thing where she had a young child before Joffrey that had died. But now that she's ""pregnant"", that would make a total of five children.

Ignoring the theories that she's not actually pregnant, I had a question about the prophecy.

So, the witch says to Cersei, of her three children, ""Gold will be their crowns, gold their shroud"". So she specifically described that these three children would be ""royal"" children or whatever. So she could still have had the first born child who died too young to be considered ""royal"" and have another child who suffers the same fate, right?

I'm just wondering if I'm misunderstanding the prophecy, since I've seen people saying that the show contradicts the prophecy with these two extra children.",17,7,False,spoiler,,,,,
