Big surprise, I loved them.  Reading the books added a new element the show watching experience and reading them after watching two seasons worked out well because I enjoyed the books better (since it added more to the experience) but still appreciated the show's adaptation.  But as the read the books, I became extremely worried about how future seasons would represent the books.  My fears were that it would be impossible to catch the immediate perspective from the character's POV that the books offer.  The thing I loved best about the books was that they were written from a particular characters perspective which allowed the reader to hear their internal dialogue.  For example, one of my favorite parts about the beginning of A Storm of Swords was the Davos chapter when he was stranded on the island and debated whether he wanted to live or die.  I also loved that he came to the conclusion to live so that he could save Stannis from the Red Woman.  It showed his loyalty to his king as well as his grief from the loss of his sons after the Battle of Blackwater.  There are many other examples from the book where the reader gets this in depth character insight which I loved.  My fear became that the show would be unable to catch this in depth insight since you cannot employ a 24/7 voice over for each character to explain their inner thoughts and motivations.  Sadly, watching season 3 tonight my fears came true, most painstakingly true in Davos's scenes.  I felt the inner turmoil was lost and was left wanting more.  So right now I am kind of scared of how the rest of the season will go and would like some input from others.  Am I wrong for feeling this way? Am I wanting the show to follow the book to much?  After all a tv or movie adaption of a book is always limited and can only an interpretation.  Are there others that feel this way?  What about those who read the books first and watched season one and two, did you go through this and were you able to get over it?  Any direction will help.  I am hoping that I am just tired from the Easter celebrations today as well as also watching the walking dead finale but I did not enjoy the premiere.  I am going to watch it again and I hope that I can learn to love it but I have my fears.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

 Its been floating around reddit and other forums and had been considered to be fairly ridiculous by most. And then, in the first episode of season 3, a child that appeared human hissed like an animal and jumped into the sea.

That was during the war of the five kings, so one would have imagined that he would turn up sooner or later in the camps of Renly, Stannis (likely), Robb or even Balon Greyjoy (less likely). He never did though, IIRC there was even a scene where Cersei noticed this very fact.

Well on the other hand there was this weird guy, from westeros, fighting with a stick and squiring to this comical fighting-pit ""gladiator"" (God I hope he appears in the show), calling himself Arstan Whitebeard.

The scene where Jorah finally reveals his identity, after he saved Dany's life for the second time, with the words ""Every man in the seven Kingdoms know's Barristan the Bold."" gave me chills. One of my favourite scenes.

Do you read character dialogues in different voices?



What voice does the narrator have? Yours? Morgan Freeman?



Maybe he has none? Do you just try not to focus on the voice and instead interpret the things you read as visual content? For example,

&gt; *""Many a time Asha had watched the maester draw splinters from her mother's heels of a morning,""*

Would you, while reading this part, imagine some sort of a narrator telling the story to you, or would you translate it to visuals - imagining Asha watching the maester in the past, without ""listening"" to the text too much?



When you read things that are currently going on in the present, are you a third party observing the scene? Or do you always transform into the character whose chapter you are currently reading?

**---------------------------------------**

When it comes to me, I interpret text that isn't direct speech as visuals or sounds, always observing the scene from a third party and visualizing it with as many details as I can get from the text. When it comes to direct speech, I always hear the text in the voice of the character who is speaking ( the TV show helped me with this ).

What about you? I find this very interesting and would like to know more about other people's reading experiences.

Excuse my bad wording, I'm not a native speaker and I found it pretty difficult to explain myself atleast half as well as I would like to...

Now that the first episode of the season is out of the way (quite successfully, might I add), the mods of both /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones can finally release some really cool news.

We have received advanced manuscripts of The Winds of Winter

As many of you know rumors have been circulating the Interwebs for months that Bantam-Spectra had decided to approach the moderators of many of the most popular ASOIAF forums/fan-sites with an offer to read these amazing chapters. We mods have, sadly, been forced to delete all references to that rumor until now. We have not been allowed to publicly comment about it. Worst of all we have been unable to explain why (normally whenever we remove a post/comment we PM the OP to explain why: in this case we could not). Rest assured we have kept a list of everyone affected by this and will be contacting them shortly to give them their long overdue explanation (basically a link to this post).

Long story short, GRRM's editor, Anne Groell, contacted us and the /r/asoiaf mods and asked us to participate in a Ranging Initiative (RI). The RI was an effort to begin a mid-size viral marketing campaign for the books via outlets like Reddit, GRRM fansites, and Facebook. All of this in an effort to assure people GRRM is focusing on the books just as hard as he is focusing on the TV show. 

Needless to say, she didn't need to ask twice. Each of us (with the exception of the newest mods) had to sign an NDA saying we can't talk about what we read. We can absolutely generate hype and get excited about it, but we can't tell anyone what we were given.

The hardest part of it was keeping it a secret from you guys, the dedicated fans who made this sub one of the largest outlets for GOT related material and, thus, drawing the attention of Anne here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR we got 11 chapters of the new TWOW manuscript Fed-Ex'd to each mod (a little over 200 pages iirc). Some had already been released as teasers, and some are brand new.

We had originally planned to post a picture of the manuscript, but our friends at /r/asoiaf have already tried and were immediately contacted by GRRM's lawyers saying to take it down. [Link to their thread about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1be9an/major_spoilers_twow_spoilers_crow_business_super/)

This is basically an AMAA to get you guys hyped for TWOW. I will do my best to answer truthfully without giving too much away.

Here are the POVs:

- Victarion

- Sansa

- Tyrion (x2)

- Connington

- Arianne

- Jamie (x2)

If you watch Natalie Dormer's lips, though, as she says it, you can see that she does not say a hundred, but rather a thousand.

A couple include:

1. Sam not sending the Ravens/not killing a White Walker: When Mormont asks Sam if he sends the Raven, he says he doesnt, but there is some hesitation before he says it. Now it seams obvious they want us to think that he's hesitating because he's ashamed of his fuck up, but what if he did, like in the book, send the ravens without messages attached? Maybe he is hesitating because he wants to say he sent them, but he thinks to himself that without the messages it's useless and Mormont wouldnt care or be even more angry, so he just says he didn't send them at all. I wouldnt be surprised if they reveal this is what happened. And for Sam the Slayer: I think Sam may kill a white walker yet, in the next few episodes. 

2. ""Did you see where they put the bastard?"" the conversation between Jon and Mance was so short, and Mance has yet to tell him about him being at Winterfell in what would be the first episode. I have a feeling this conversation will still happen later. I'm sure Mance and Jon will have a bit more screen time in the coming episodes.

You could tell they really wanted to catch up with as many characters as possible within the time they had. Saying that I do have a few issues with this one.

My main complaint... Why did Sir Barristan Selmy reveal himself so soon??? This happens like 3/4 into book 3. There was no need for him to pop that hood off so soon. I would have loved to have seen everyones reactions when he goes from old man to knight. 

Building off that point.... Where was Strong Belwas??? Personally I love his character. I'm not sure why, but the guy just cracks me up. I'm hoping maybe he'll be introduced later on so he can still have his duel. 

The one other thing I noticed is last season Loras had blonde hair. Maybe it was just the lighting, but this season it looked brown. Recast? 

Other than that I thought they did a good job. I just feel like HBO makes some changes that they don't need to make and subtle details suffer for it. Just my opinion. What do you all think?",7,1,False,self,,,,,

Those who remember my followups from the previous season ([here's the last one, for ""Valar Morghulis""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ulutf/followup_for_nonreaders_valar_morghulis/)) have possibly became fellow readers already, so I won't be recalling those much. What am I trying to do here is to include some background that the show couldn't deliver due to time restrains. This followup can greatly increase your viewer experience by expanding your knowledge of Westeros without lurking into spoiler-heavy fansites. This is a TV series subreddit for all viewers, after all, not Event Anticipation Club.

**TL;DR: Stay a non-reader, but learn facts about the events so you're on par with readers! Not interested? Upvote for OC**

**Northern Exposure**

&gt; ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"" - Jeor Mormont... well, he almost said it.

* The whole White Walkers encounter from last season's finale occured in the prologue of *A Storm of Swords*, so it's nice to see that season 3 starts with the Night's Watch as well. There is not much more that a reader knows by this point, even though the scene is handled from a quite different perspective.

* The CGI budget has expanded far enough to let us see a GIANT! This was one of the things the readers feared to see getting cut from the show due to financial restrains. For us it might seem quite overwhelming - dragons, shadow babies and now giants - however, from the perspective of various characters, all or most of those things are still quite surreal. Stories of mammoth-riding giants are considered myths in the South.

* Ghost was supposed to be with Jon, but until things go forward, it's hard to compare his role in the story - and so far it has been done well enough to put aside those matters. Some book readers admit that Jon Snow's explanation in the show is actually more believable than in the books, so I'm not going to quote it as it doesn't bring anything more to his character.

* All in all, North of the Wall due to relatively narrow lead cast doesn't require much explanation and I find it quite impressive, nice job done.

**Lion Swarm**

&gt; ""They said you lost your nose"" - Cersei, giving a huge nod to the readers

* If you haven't known already: Book Tyrion is repulsive. Disfigured body, eyes of different colour, ugly face. Since there are no ugly people in TV, Peter Dinklage didn't get any orcification treatment and the most touching outcome of the Battle of Blackwater, which was Tyrion losing his nose (yeah, literally) has been diminished to a single line.

* The boy that fetched Bronn is Podrick Payne, related to Illyn Payne, the tongue-less executioner. You remember him saving Tyrion's ass in the battle.

* There's possibly more to Tyrion-Tywin relation than it seems, but as of ASOS it's merely a speculation, so it doesn't count as a straightforward book fact. What's important here is that Jamie joined the Kingsguard in order to be close to Cersei and Tywin wanted him to be his heir, which Jaime denounced by thaking the whitecloak vows.

* Tywin Lannister has a thing with the reputation of the Lannister family, as he's the sole source of their power. Tywin's father has been disregarded by his bannermen and their rebellion, crushed unexpectedly by young Tywin, is what started the lion's rise.

* King's Landing has been troubling with more disasters than Stannis knocking at their door - flow of people fleeing from the pillaged Riverlands brought diseases and famine. Tyrells came to save the day in more ways than just the military one.

**Lone Island**

&gt; ""Death by fire is the purest death"" - Melissandre, giving us a glympse of why sending crazy witches to pyre could be considered a reasonable move

* I think the most important thing missing from the books are Davos's other sons who didn't die in the battle. Losing his only son made our beloved smuggler a slightly different character. Just as with the Night's Watch plot, it's difficult to fill in the blanks until both book plot and the show plot come to the same conclusion.

* Now that Davos has been found alive, Battle of Blackwater lost its body count amongst the main cast, limiting it to Matthos, Davos's son. Books give us names and names and names of dead and/or captured lords sworn to house Baratheon and Davos loses more than one son there, so yeah, there were victims that were supposed to matter.

* Just like every other location in this episode, we have experienced merely the beginning, an unfinished setup, so it's too early to start filling the background with Stannis's family (yeah, such a thing exists) and advisors - however, they're all barely of any importance.

**Cursed Castle**

&gt; ""There will be no siege"" - Robb Stark, as if he was announcing that budget cuts were an issue

* Harrenhal used to be the capital of the Riverlands until the castle got obliterated in dragonfire. Since then every house seated in there has eventually died out, which gave the place such a bad name. The current capital of the Riverlands is Riverrun, home of the Tullys (family of Catelyn and her sister).

* Ser Gregor Clegane, ""The Mountain"", has been known for pillaging the Riverlands on Tywin's unofficial orders (see: season 1).

* The two men advising Robb are his main bannermen: Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark - you should remember them from season 2. The Karstark boys died in the final battle of S01E10 (the one that got Jaime captured). Roose is the one who promised Robb that his son will take revenge on Theon Greyjoy. Karstarks are actually a distant branch of the Stark family.

**S. S. Dragons**

&gt; ""Not fast enough"" - Dany, summing up her storyline

* DRAGONS DRAGONS DRAGONS. The one Dany looks at is Drogon, the one named after her husband and obviously her favourite. After the fish BBQ scene the audience's favourite as well.

* The Unsullied will be probably talked about in the following episodes so I'll drop more background about their training a little bit later. If you go back to S01E01, you can notice that Illyrio Mopatis had at least two of those guarding his house in Pentos.

* Shenanigans! The warlock kid disappeared in the water in a quite cheesy way, but hey, action! Expect the readers to swarm related discussion with speculation tags instead of spoiler ones as the warlock arc wasn't supposed to be a thing by now (the assassination attempt has been performed by a group called ""Sorrowful Men"", whose trademark is apologizing before killing). I wrote last year about the major difference between book and show versions of the House of Undying and unfortunately this is the point where you simply have to read the books to get the whole picture.

* Barristan Selmy is a very famous person in Westeros. In the books he's recalled many times by various people as a model knight. His appearence is held secret for half of the third book as he introduces himself as ""Arstan Whitebeard"" and despite the obvious name resemblance, his revelation comes as a true surprise.

For major spoilers in the book, I will still use spoiler tags, and I would appreciate if everyone in the thread does the same. That being said, I don't think that can be enforced, so show-watchers beware.

I will be analyzing the reasons and consequences of the changes in the first episode that aired last night. I will be using [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bfbp7/spoilers_asos_differences_between_s3e1_and_asos/) thread from /r/asoiaf to make sure I don't miss any changes, but if I do, just comment and let me know.

1. Tormund's change in demeanor: I'm not sure whether Tormund's lack of boisterousness is a change for the whole season, or if it was an act he put on in front of Jon. While I would hate for him to lost his comedic side, I think I could understand the change, as we will be exposed to fewer wildlings in the show than in the book. Besides Mance, who was raised on the Wall, we will only see Ygritte, Tormund, Orell, and maybe the Lord of Bones. Combining all the wildlings into (essentially) Tormund and Orell will require some personality changes. I predict Orell will mostly be Varamyr Sixskins' personality, I think Tormund will combine book Tormund's role with the role of the Magnar of Thenn.

2. The Barristan Reveal: They had two options: Have Barristan reveal himself immediately or to keep the Arstan Whitebeard plot (in which he waits to reveal who he is until later in the season). Because of the nature of television, hiding Barristan from the audience would be impossible, and to not acknowledge who he is would be very confusing to non-book readers, hence why they didn't do #1. I think that while the reveal was nice, the story line won't be any worse for this change. The difference will be that the revelation of [ASOS](/b ""Jorah's betrayal"") will have to be altered, as [ASOS](/b ""there would be no reason for Barristan to keep mum for the whole third season."") EDIT: Spoil tagged something that was beyond the scope I mentioned in my disclaimer up top. It was already explicitly stated in Season 1 and implied in Season 2, but it's better safe than sorry.

3. Qyburn's Introduction: I think Qyburn's introduction was the biggest surprise of the episode (for me, at least), because I didn't hear anything about him before the season began. The introduction will be sooner, which I think implies that he's going to be as major a character -- if not more major -- in upcoming seasons as he was in the book.

4. Robb at Harrenhal: I'm a little puzzled, as Robb is supposed to [ASOS](/b ""Go to Riverrun and the Twins"") by the time the season is over. But I guess if Littlefinger can go from KL to the Stormlands to Harrenhal and back to the Reach before returning to KL at the end of the season, then there's no reason Robb can't jump around. I expect this will be how Roose is left at Harrenhal, but Robb will be heading north again by the end of the next episode. [ACOK](/b ""I think learning of Bran and Rickon's death will occur next week too."")

5. Jon's Reason for Turning cloak: I think they did okay here, even if I'll miss the ""Did you see where they sat the bastard?"" line. They couldn't spend a ton of time having Mance explain his trip to Winterfell, so to include that line would be odd. I actually like the way that they played it off here. In the books, I was a bit confused by his reasoning, as even bastards could rise high in the NW, meaning his status wouldn't push him to desert. By faking disillusionment of the NW to Mance, Jon's reasons are stronger. [ASOS](/b ""It also brings Craster (and Gilly, by association) back to the forefront of show-watchers' minds, as they didn't appear after S2E04 or S2E05."")

6. Dany's Attack: This made a lot of sense too. I like that they aren't starting off in Qarth this season, as the location of the attack doesn't matter much. I also think that having the assassination attempt by the warlocks as opposed to Sorrowful Men makes more sense. They don't have to explain the Sorrowful Men, and it more directly associates the assassination attempt to the warlocks than in the book.

7. Margaery: I don't think this is a large change from the books. In Tyrion's POV, we learn that the Tyrells are loved by the people for saving the city and bringing food. This just allows the audience to see Margaery's PR a little more directly. Plus, the scene with Loras/Marg and Cersei/Joff was hilarious. My second-favorite scene of the night.

8. Littlefinger's Plan: Okay, so they aren't cloak-and-daggering this story line in the show. That takes away the surprise at the end of the book that [ASOS](/b ""Littlefinger is the one who helps Sansa escape."") This means there will be more intrigue in the plot. I think Littlefinger will have a more hands on role with [ASOS](/b ""Olenna's plot to bring Sansa to the Reach."") Plus, with Ros as Varys' spy, and now managing LF's affairs, I think [ASOS](/b ""she will be the one to betray that plot to Varys, who will then tell Tywin and lead to Sansa's new marriage."")

9. Shae's Past?: I almost got the vibe for a second that Ros knew Shae, which makes no sense when I stepped back to think about it. But I like that there is a little more intrigue about the character. [ASOS](/b ""I get the feeling that she is more genuine in the show, so maybe shedding some light on her past will make her betrayal of Tyrion a little more understandable."")

10. Sam forgetting the ravens: This makes sense, even if I don't like it. In the show, Sam's ""craven"" arc kind of ended by S2. S2 saw him 1) attempt to protect Gilly, 2) offer his services to the LC so Jon could range, and 3) reading up on the Others, potentially saving the NW with the three horns business. He needs to fuck up so that [ASOS](/b ""Sam the Slayer"") comes out of left field and is completely redeeming. It'll be his arc this season, from fuck up to [ASOS](/b ""badass"").

11. Ghost with the NW: I don't get this much. In the show, we last saw Ghost with Jon and Qhorin before they found Ygritte. Now Ghost is back at the Fist. Not sure where they're going with that at all.

12. Unsullied: They kind of left out a lot of their training, including growing up with puppies that they must kill after years of attachment, walking on hot coals without flinching, etc. Overall, a lot of the exchange between Dany and the slaver was kept in, and things were pretty true to the book. I think we'll learn more and more about the Unsullied as the season progresses, instead of all at once. EDIT: Totally forgot about Stannis.

13. Davos/Stannis/Mel: They seem to be streamlining the story a bit. If memory serves, in the book, Davos was imprisoned without seeing Stannis for his intention to kill Mel. Mel eventually has him brought to Stannis. I didn't like seeing Stannis give the order to imprison Davos, but I don't think it'll have a huge impact on the story.

I am assuming they will do something like that later in the season.

From what i can see it reads:

Here it is for the lazy:

1. Valar Dohaeris
1. Dark Wings, Dark Words
1. Walk of Punishment
1. And Now His Watch Is Ended
1. Kissed by Fire
1. The Climb
1. The Bear and the Maiden Fair
1. Second Sons
1. The Rains of Castamere
1. Mhysa

This is my take on what happens on the following episodes, based on their names (**CAREFUL, HORRIBLE SPOILERS FROM ASoS FOLLOW**):

---

&gt; Dark Wings, Dark Words

Either because of Bran and the three eyed crow, or a raven from Riverrun reaching Robb, telling him Hoster Tully is about to die, making Robb go to Riverrun with Cat, leaving Bolton in charge of Harrenhal.

&gt; Walk of Punishment

Probably for Jaime being taken to Harrenhal, where he gets his hand cut off by Bolton's men (the fact that they find Qyburn in Harrenhal pretty much signals that they are not including the Bloody Mummers).

&gt; And Now His Watch Is Ended

Commander Mormont :(

&gt; Kissed by Fire

Jon Snow gets laid. And maybe even Dany taking Astapor.

&gt; The Climb

Duh. Jon going over the Wall, maybe even the attack on Castle Black.

&gt; The Bear and the Maiden Fair

Jaime rescuing Brienne from the bear pit at Harrenhal.

&gt; Second Sons

Daario joins Dany. Since it seems we don't have Strong Belwas, maybe Daario is the one to duel for Yunkai. Who knows.

&gt; The Rains of Castamere.

Heh.

&gt; Mhysa.

The taking of Mereen.

Ranking of Power

Tywin Lannister +8
Tywin is a major asshole, but he is running shit as Hand.  He's got three kingdoms in open rebellion, but is he freaking out about it? Hell no. 

Mance Rayder +6
Just look at his army. They are some bad ass men and women. Oh yeah, and giants. 

Jon Snow +5
Meets Mance Rayder, doesn't get his head cut off. 

Davos Seaworth +4
Not even wildfire can take him out. He goes back to Stannis to tell him what is what knowing damn well something bad is going to happen to him. 

Margaery Tyrell +4
Margaery is strutting her stuff all over King's Landing. Orphans love her. 

Daenyrs Targaryen +3
Nice dragons, but you need an army. Call me back when you grow a pair and hire the Unsullied.

Melisandre +2
Melisandre is one crazy bitch and if burning people alive is your thing, Melisandre has got it on lock.

Bronn +2
Making coin and tapping ass.

Ser Barristan Selmy +1
Barristan has got the whole Obi-Wan thing going on. That's cool.

Cersei Lannister +1
Not really running things now that daddy is home.

Jorah Mormont -1
Barristan just stole your thunder yo.

Peter Baelish 0
We know you are up to something but I just don't know. 

Samwell Tarly -2
You had one job.

Sansa Stark -2
Sucks to be her. That is all.

Tyrion Lannister -3
Tyrion really got the smack down. Daddy is mean, we get it. But you need to suck it up and get your head back in the game (of thrones).

Joffrey Baratheon -5
Just be glad you got this many points. 

Robb Stark -6
You may have won some battles King of the North, but look what happened while you were away. 

Stannis Baratheon -8
Considering the spanking you received, the sulking around Dragonstone is definitely understandable. But you are totally whipped by your woman.

Most (not all) non-readers would miss the small hints she gave during the scene.
* This episode's entries in the ""Things readers forgot about the books"" FAQ I hope to write one day:

 * Yes, in *ASoS*, an Unsullied soldier's nipple is cut off to demonstrate his pain resistance as part of the sales process to Dany. It's not something the show's writers made up.
 * Neither is the Unsullied each killing a slave baby as part of training. [*ASoS*](/b ""They *also* raise and kill puppies"").

* I've mocked, as others have, the theory that Ros will be the show's replacement for [*ADwD*](/b ""Jeyne Poole as the fake Arya"") Yes, the show has simplified some things, including collapsing multiple characters into one; this, however, seemed too much for no reason, given that [S1/*AGoT*](/b ""even aside from the age difference, the show has already shown Jeyne Poole on the screen, albeit in a nonspeaking role""). It would not be hard to have [*ADwD*](/b ""Theon tell whoever the show recasts as Jeyne in S4-S5 'Hey, I remember you. You're Arya's friend that the Lannisters captured when they arrested Lord Stark.'"") That said, one reason to think otherwise occurred this episode, when Ros's northern origin ""in the shadows of [Sansa's] father's castle"" was explicitly mentioned. I still think--and hope--it's not likely, but the odds may have risen.
* Barristan Selmy is, as in the books, the first character Dany meets that moved from Westeros to Essos after her marriage. While he was a tertiary character in S1--above Lancel Lannister in importance but below Jorah, Varys, Pycelle, or Littlefinger--he now [*ASoS*](/b ""becomes about as important as Jorah in Dany's life in terms of serving as her advisor and defender. This will increase further, of course, once Jorah is exiled,"") and by [*ADwD*](/b ""he'll be Dany's Hand and, after her flight, the regent""). I wonder if Ian McElhinney knows just how [*ADwD*](/b ""prominent"") his role is going to become in future seasons?
* Seeing a giant in the episode is gratifying because there was reason to fear, after Lord Mormont's speech in S1E10 omitted mention of giants while otherwise faithful to *AGoT*, that we would not. Let's keep our fingers crossed that we'll also see [*AGoT*](/b ""mammoths,"") especially in [*ASoS*](/b ""the wildling attacks on the Wall"").
* Readers know that having Qyburn in a place with [*AFfC*](/b ""lots of dead bodies around is not a great idea."") Perhaps we'll see him [Speculation](/g ""forced to flee Robb's forces when, after he's asked to help treat the wounded as a maester,"") is [*AFfC*](/b ""discovered performing unholy and unnatural experiments with the dead and the living? Or, perhaps, Roose Bolton will encourage his work with living flesh?"").
* It's possible that the scene with Bolton and Karstark conversing will, [*ASoS*](/b ""after Karstark's execution, give some on-screen justification for Bolton's betrayal."")
* Since the attempted assassination via manticore occurred in Astapor, and [*ACoK*](/b ""not Qarth,"") I would not be shocked to see [Speculation](/g ""additional attempts by the warlocks on Dany's life during this and future seasons; in other words, making them a recurring background threat."")

For those who've read *ASoS* I've written more [in another Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1be2er/asoss3_spoilers_shocking_s3_events_that_the/) that you'll find interesting and amusing.

My question (more of a confirmation or rejection of my idea of the strategy used) is about the battle after Robb crosses the twins to capture Jaimie Lannister (in AGOT &amp; Season 1) and is probably best understood with a map of Westeros close by. Tywin Lannister and his army are attacking/raiding the Trident. Jaimie Lannister and his men are attacking/raiding around Riverrun. Robb's plan was to make Tywin Lannister's men believe that they are coming down the kingsroad to attack them, while in reality crossing the Twins to take Jaimie Lannister and his men by surprise. Everyone essentially knows that  once you're far enough south on one side of the Green Fork, it's nearly impossible to cross and get to Riverrun (except at the Twins). So Robb sends a (smaller? larger?) army to head down the kingsroad past the Twins to make Tywin believe his full army is coming for him and takes the other part of his army with him across the Twins and capture Jaimie.

As far as I can tell the books take place over the course of ~3 years. However I expect the TV series to take at least 1-2 seasons per book. This would take maybe 8 years.

A lot can be done with makeup and most characters probably won't live long enough anyways, but for the younger characters (Aria, Bran, Rickon, Tommen, ...) it will soon be difficult to hide, that the actors are aging much faster than their characters.

For instance, I quickly explained to my friends about Davos's necklace, because Sallador Saan made a reference to it in their dialogue of s03e01. That's nothing; it's a detail. However, there are other things I'm debating on telling them, because they kind of seem spoilery.

For instance, I'm pretty sure by now in the books it's been mentioned that there are abnormal wolf-packs causing trouble, lead by a massive she-wolf. Obviously, Nymeria. Now, should I tell my friends this tid-bit? I feel like they'd love it, but the show might bring it up later (or not). Advice on stuff like this?

- Contains spoilers from all five books -

War of the Five Kings = War of the Roses
Series of wars between two rival houses, the Lancasters (the Lannisters of Casterly Rock) and the Yorks (the Starks) and five would-be kings. The York's are from the North and the Lancaster's are famous for being rich.
The King did not maintain a standing army, instead relying on nobles to provide troops (something Joffrey himself talks about with Cersei in episode 3 of season 1, video = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h94nCIYPgGs).
 
Tyrion Lannister = Jeffrey Hudson
Not brother to a queen, but known as the Queens dwarf, only dwarf from the family, he fought on the Queens side in the English civil war, involved in a duel (although Tyrions turns out differently), flees, and is forced into slavery.
 
Red Wedding = St. Bartholomes Daw massacre
A little more loosely based, but the wedding was held under the guide of peace until the church bells rang to signal the attack (Reins of Castomere), the bodies of the dead were thrown into the river, and conspiracy theories suggested the royal court planned the massacres.

Elizabeth Woodvile = Talisa Maegyr/Jeyne Westerling (wife of Robb Stark) - Married in secret to King Edward IV (Yorkist claimant to the throne, who despite his young age won every battle). She was formerly a Lancaster supporter. Their marriage alienated Richard Neville (King Edward's main ally) who had been negotiating with the French for him to marry a French princess, Bona of Savoy. He considered the marriage an insult and switch sides in secret to the Lancaster's, luring the King into a trap. It was also claimed by Richard III he had a pre-contract to be married to Lady Eleanor Butler but historians believe today this was a lie by Richard III to declare their children as illegitimate.

The Wall = Hadrian's Wall - Build to keep the 'barbarians' of the North out of Roman occupied Britain. The video (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsg7kKx-AGA) shows George R.R. Martin being interviewed with the producers of Game of Thrones. They discuss the real wall and how his exaggeration of its size makes it in a way more accurate. Giving us the feeling (in the day of skyscrapers) of awe that it would have given the people during that time period.

Maggy the Frog's Prophesy - Maid of Lorraine prophecies
Maggy the Frog predicted many things in Cersei's future, one of which is that everything she had would be taken away by a younger and more beautiful queen, who she believes to be Margaery Tyrell. The Maid of Lorraine prophesies, which have been phrased in different ways, but roughly that France would be ruined through a woman and afterwards restored by a virgin. The virgin is believed to be Joan of Arc and the woman was Isabeau of Bavaria (who is accused of having many affairs, one with her king husband's brother, which was considered incestuous at the time).

Of course there are many differences (no zombies or dragons) and the details of the events are different (like Cersei has more differences with Anne Neville than similarities), but clearly inspired by true historical events of the late middle ages.",7,26,False,self,,,,,

Got tired of pretentious friends of mine telling me the show sucks compared to the book and decided to find out for myself.

Only 200 pgs into GoT, and so far, all I have to say is stop worrying whether the show or books is better, and just read them when you get time. For everything that's great about the show, there is something just as good about the experience of reading it that you couldn't get from watching and vice versa.

What we have been given from the mind of George R. R. Martin transcends mediums and is just powerful storytelling. 

In short, EXPERIENCE GAME OF THRONES AS MANY WAYS AS POSSIBLE, IT IS LIFE-CHANGING.

Other starring actors (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Maisie Williams, Isaac Hempstead-Wright) are left out. 

Nothing too earth-shattering, but it's amusing to see that the cast of the show is so damn big that they're forced to only list characters that are specifically in the episode playing.

I guess that's another way to know which characters we'll be seeing. If Dinklage isn't listed in the credits, we won't be seeing Tyrion this episode.

Just an amusing footnote I thought you all might enjoy. ",15,15,False,self,,,,,

We here at www.wesuckatgames.com have opened up a new series of spoilercasts, starting our first season off with two of the best shows on TV - The Walking Dead, and Game of Thrones. Axel Radman, myself and Wingman go into detail on our thoughts on both of these shows, what occurred, and what we think may happen going forward. 

This is our first episode of a podcast/spoilercast series, and we'd love some feedback. We've been mostly doing let's play series this past year, but figured it was time to move into another series! So please tell us your thoughts, because each week we will be coming back with new casts, on shows, movies and games!

If I want to pay, do I just have to get a check from my bank and send it to them via mail?

So I finished ADWD in February and immediately decided to start reading AGOT again.  I felt I needed to go back to notice GRRMs foreshadowing that I missed the first time through the book, and perhaps even create my own predictions for Winds of Winter and beyond.

As we know, Daenerys lets Drogon roam free, allowing him to grow much larger than her other two dragons. Viserion and Rhagal are not only smaller than Drogon, but are growing smaller than normal (i.e. past Targaryen dragons) because they are caged.  

In my opinion the characters from the first book are the main characters for the entire story.  GRRM started writing from book one without much knowledge for the preceding books, and so I think it fair to assume this.  Of course there are many other important characters but the bulk of importance lies with Tyrion, Bran, Jon, and Daenerys.  GRRM is known for letting the reader believe one thing that may seem likely, and pulling a twist (e.g. Ned Stark is not the main character of ASOIAF).

Early on in the first book, we learn a bit about Tyrion.  I dont have the books on me so I cant provide exact quotes but basically in the first few Tyrion chapters we learn he wanted to study to become a septon but was told he was allowed by his father.  He ended up spending much of his childhood reading history, and fantasizing about dragons.  As he got older he put those thoughts to rest, knowing that all the dragons were killed long ago.  Tyrion starts as a lowly character, one the reader would least expect to do something extraordinary later in the story. 
 
Brandon Stark: The first Stark to feel pain on behalf of a Lannister.  As we all know early in AGOT he falls and breaks his legs.  Brandon wishes to be able to walk again, but he told he never will.  From the start of the story, the reader believes Bran will not be able to do anything extraordinary because of his disability.  However, the three-eyed crow tells him he needs to fly or die.

My theory is much speculation; however it is a fun one to think about.  Drogon is a black dragon with red horns, spine, and eyes.  This is the same color as the sigil of House Targaryen so it makes sense that Dany ends up riding Drogon.  She is the Mother of Dragons, and Drogon is the largest of the three so it only makes sense that this happens (which it does). 

Viserion is a cream colored dragon.  His wings, horns, and spinal crest are gold.  The colors match well with that of House Lannister.  Rhagal is green and bronze scaled.  His green scales are described as dark green, the green moss in the deep wood at dusk. House Starks sigil is a grey direwolf over a white field, although sometimes it is a grey direwolf over a white and green field.  It would make sense that this sigil is used more often at the end of winter, when life returns and the green starts to show through the snow.  

My prediction is that House Targaryen, Lannister, and Stark will reunite in order to overcome the darkness that is growing beyond the wall.  Daenerys will ride Drogon, which she already has.  The two smaller dragons will be rode by two smaller characters: The Imp, Tyrion Lannister, and the crippled child, Brandon Stark. Tyrion will ride Viserion as the dragons colors match that of House Lannister.   Bran will ride Rhagal, though a bit of a stretch, because Rhagals colors match that of House Stark at the end of winter, when these Houses will eventually reunite after many years of fighting each other.  

Another prediction is that Bran uses his warg abilities to control the flight of the dragon and pick up Jon Snow at some point.  If Snow is alive, being that he is the son of Rhagar Targaryen, it also fits that he rides the dragon that is named after his father.  This is all speculation of course, but the clues fit.  I dont think they will all be best buddies at the end of the story and ride the dragons together North of the Wall to fight evil, but I do think it is possible for the dragons to separate at some point (which has already happened) and end up at the same location as Bran and Tyrion.  

TLDR: Tyrion and Bran ride the two smaller dragons because they are smaller people.  Dany rides the largest dragon.  House Stark, Targaryen, and Lannister combine to fight the white walkers.

Ser Jorah Mormont is quoted saying that Dothraki follow power. I believe that the khalasar, after capturing and most likely enslaving Danny, will make their way towards the mountain in which Drogon's lair is located. Drogon will eventually attack the khalasar, only to find that his mother is in danger. He will burn and destroy men and horse alike, until Daenerys once again gains control of Drogon and becomes a true badass dragon we have all been waiting for. When the Dothraki witnesses Drogon's power and the control Danny has over him, they will declare Danny as Khal Daenerys. She will then lead her khalasar back to Mereen, appearing at the perfect time when it seems all hope is lost for Barristan Selmy and her city.

Then again GRRM has a tendency of taking his story in the exact opposite direction in which you would expect, so this could be very far off.

Thoughts?

He finally took a place on the bench near his other friends.  Pyp was telling Dolorous Edd about the contest they'd had to see which of the straw solderis could collect the most wildling arrows.

""Was it a long fall?"" Grenn wanted to know,  ""did landing in the pool of water save his life?""

So far, the only hints of it that we've had are Bran's wolf dreams, but now we're going to have Jojen and a Wildling skinchanger to elaborate on the concept.

Will parts be expanded or cut out? As we know, skinchanging is an integral part of Bran's character, but he's not the only Stark who can do it. Arya has wolf dreams as well, and dreams of Nymeria pulling Cat's corpse from the river. Jon is a warg as well GRRM has said that Robb is warg as well, but nothing huge ever comes of it before his death. 

Will Jon and Arya have their warging shown, or will it be cut? Arya finds out about Cat's death through Nymeria, but it's not like she can't figure it out on her own.

[AFFC Arya](#b ""It becomes much more important to her character when she starts her Faceless Man training, though."")

[ADWD Jon/Speculation](#b ""Jon's status as a warg may be very important as well, if the theory that he warged into Ghost during his last chapter turns out to be true."")

So, thoughts? Will Arya figure out she has wolf dreams? Will a big hairy giant named Hag the Mighty say, ""Yer a warg, Jon""? Will Orell or some other Wildlings help Jon figure out he has the gift?",7,3,False,self,,,,,

(no spoilers obviously)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1brgqn/bookreaders_what_are_some_cool_interesting_facts/,illthinkofsomething,1365200070,"I love hearing the background stories and some interesting stories or scenes that are left out of the show. I seriously cant get enough of those little tidbits of info (that I assume came from the books) They are always interesting to hear whenever I stubble upon one but I am afraid to seek them out myself being afraid of spoilers.

A prime example of this was in the last episode that aired, when Ser Barriston Selmy reveals himself to Dany and I was like, 

""Oh yea that guy, hes back. Cool."" 

But apparently to everyone this was a huge deal! I didn't really understand why until doing some internet research and reading about how he was such a badass or whatever. The show never really portrayed that. I remember a few scenes, I think in season one with he, King Robert and Jamie swapping stories but that still didn't really do him justice.

So do you readers have anything else like that? Stuff for show watchers who want to delve in deeper to the story and back-stories that the show hasn't done justice?

Edit: Thanks to those that have responded. I think we are brushing on some plot points that have been missed in the series that may circle back around this season, which is fine but stuff like character development or the interactions between characters that the show didn't show enough of to really explain their relationship is all good stuff I'd like to discuss.

Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of ""You should really read the books."" -Not in a snarky way which I appreciate. I really do want to but I just don't have the time. Working a full-time job plus being engaged, planning a wedding, watching this show (and other show's I like), watching sports, browsing Reddit, hanging out with friends and actually spending some time outside now that the weather is starting to warm up, I just don't have the time unfortunately.

I am a graduate student at Baylor University focusing on rhetoric and pop culture. Currently, a co-worker and I are working on a study of Reddit and, in particular, this wonderful sub. It is a fascinating intersection of media--literature, television, and the internet--and it seems as if it should attract more scholarship than it has thus far.

This is where you come in. It would be unbelievably helpful for us if you could spend five minutes on [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ps9M54vk-92tb282DoYJl03VW3ZG8Le-dG-rUkT7pkY/viewform). We aren't able to repay you, except for with our thanks and with some of the information. We can't share everything that we'll gather, as we are pursuing publication, but we'll be able to post some of the more interesting finds.

In addition, if you have any fan art or cosplay pictures that you are interested in contributing to the study please send them with your permission to digitalrhetoricandcomposition@gmail.com

Thank you very much!


P.S. - I know this is slightly off topic, but I hope that you are willing to  forgive us.

EDIT: Thanks for being so awesome! Here's some quick and dirty information for you. We're waiting until we stop accepting new entries for the crosstabs.

First: This is not the place to get a date. 81% of you are male, and 57% of you all are at least somewhat introverted. That vast majority of you are 19-24, and only 7% of y'all are 30 or over. The subreddit is overwhelmingly white (88%), and highly educated (71% of you are attending or have attended college or higher).

Not surprisingly, 96% of respondents have watched every episode of the show, but only 65% have read every book.

The Starks are the most popular house with 33% of subredditors favoring the Direwolf, and 95% viewing them favorably. 

The Lannisters are viewed divisively: 44% view them at least somewhat favorably, while 54% view them at least somewhat unfavorably. Nobody likes the Greyjoys: only 3% of redditors picked them as their favorite house and 79% view them at least somewhat unfavorably.",153,251,False,self,,,,,

Now I'm only halfway through a Clash of Kings (I'm fully caught up on the show however) but the Greyjoys and pretty much all iron islanders are fruckin' assholes. To Theon, to each other, to everyone. Now it's nothing new for me to dislike characters in GoT. The character are so complex that it's hard to hate any of them completely. House Lannister in a great example, Tywin is a total dick but he knows what he's doing, he's a dick for a reason, and he gets results. Jaime is rash and full of himself but god damn he's funny, cracks me up and I like him in spite of myself . Tyrion...well everyone likes Tyrion. Anyways you get the point (Cercei sucks) but the Greyjoys have no redeeming qualities. How does their society even work? With everyone so hateful and back-stabbey and with all the reaving and raping it's amazing they are a Great House at all, it seems like the Iron Islands would just collapse in on themselves. I kind of like Theon, but seriously it's hard to read his chapters in Clash of Kings for me because it's just like who's gonna treat Theon like shit next? All that being said The Greyjoys do have the coolest sigil IMO and when I was first getting into the show I was like, ""sweet they're like pirates Krakens are cool!"" but then I realized wow, these guys are all **DICKS**

This leads me to my question, does anyone favor The Greyjoys over other houses? My favs at the moment are The Mormonts. Jorah and The old Bear kick ass, and their Sigil and words are way cool. I want to move to Bear Island. But yeah defend the Greyjoys so I don't just skip Theon's chapters (not really, I'll read em' I swear)",91,32,False,self,,,,,

I love Ramin Djawadis score for Game of Thrones and think hes done a great job with it. I think its fun to identify the themes and motifs spread across the show and the soundtracks. Im in the process of trying to identify all the different themes and motifs in Game of Thrones, and thought Id share what Ive got so far so others can check it out and hopefully help as well.

Ive done a youtube link to every occurrence(that Ive identified so far) of a theme or motif in the soundtracks, but there are lots more occurrences of these musical ideas in the show itself. If the links go down, let me know and Ill try to find one up, but Ill list the time the theme or motif occurs at anyway so you can check it out if you own the soundtrack yourself. If the links down, you can always just youtube the name of the track that I provide yourself, then follow the timings I provide (like 0:15 seconds, or 1:43 seconds) to find the spots in the track that I am talking about.

---

**Some Notes Before I Start:**

GOT S1 OST = the Game of Thrones Season 1 Soundtrack, GOT S2 OST = the Game of Thrones Season 2 Soundtrack

Ive titled the themes the names that I like the best and make the most sense to me, but of course you could title them different things  what I call the Iron Throne theme you might call Kings Landing theme, or what I call Theons theme you might call Greyjoy theme. The general idea is there, regardless, and thats what matters.

Lots of the tracks use more than one theme. In my iTunes, Ive titled them like this

http://imgur.com/fy7vjuU

Im posting this to a few different places; the General Game of Thrones (the TV Show) board on westeros.org ( http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/forum/39-general-got/ ) , and the www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf and www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones subreddits on Reddit.

As for spoilers - there are very light spoilers for Season 1 and 2 / A Game of Thrones and a Clash of Kings.

**Nine primary themes or motifs:**

**Main Theme :**


I call this the Main Theme because its the theme of the main title, displayed most prominently in the opening credits. Its nice and majestic.

Three Blasts, track 21 of the GOT S2 OST

1:35 seconds, 1:54 seconds. This almost could have been in a section of its own, but I think its really just a very dark and twisted variation on the main theme, and belongs here.

---

**Stark theme**

I call this the Stark theme because it always centres around Winterfell or any of the Starks. Its pretty sparse, it suits the North. Its usually played on a violin in a pretty scratchy fashion (Im certainly not a violinist, so excuse the crude terminology!), its quite an emotional piece.

King of The North, track 26 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oth_nFcbK-Y#t=43s

0:43 seconds. Note: its titled King of the North on the official soundtrack, but Im pretty sure thats an error  shouldnt it be King IN the North?

---

Winterfell, track 6 of the GOT S2 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0U0X_wP0vMc#t=38s

0:38 seconds, 1:14 seconds

---

**Iron Throne theme**


This theme seems connected to the idea of being King, so I thought Iron Throne was a good name for it. We first hear it nice and jolly in The Kings Arrival but it gets pretty dark with some of the darker kings, see The Throne Is Mine.

---


The Kings Arrival, track 5 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MbBAtQ7bLis#t=1s

0:00 seconds, 0:09 seconds, 0:59 seconds. Seriously, this whole track is nothing but the theme being developed. Its great.

---

Youll Be Queen One Day, track 14 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=SvR2lXvDwiM#t=4s

0:04 seconds, 0:33 seconds.

---

You Win Or You Die, track 19 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wQmei_O_rcE#t=29s

0:29 seconds, 1:04 seconds.

---

The Throne Is Mine, track 2 of the GOT S2 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6OzWvUktaU8#t=30s

0:06 seconds, 0:30 seconds.

---

Wildfire, track 8 of the GOT S2 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ps7cyB9zBAc#t=91s

1:31 seconds

---

Dont Die With A Clean Sword, track 11 of the GOT S2 OST.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Dthau1KUCYI#t=1s

0:01 seconds, 1:05 seconds, 2:42 seconds.

---

**Daenerys theme**


Possibly my favourite of the lot, its a very majestic and ethereal theme. It crops up subtly a few times in Season 1 before being played strongly and fully in all its glory in the closing minutes of the Season 1 finale.

---

Finale, track 29 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=T2mBS8iW3VA#t=38s

0:38 seconds. You owe it to yourself to hear the whole track start to end. Probably the best track out of all the ones Ive listed.

---

Love in the Eyes, track 6 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=NrnR18VficE#t=130s

2:10 seconds, 3:30 seconds


---

Fire and Blood, track 29 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gNxbquecGsY#t=81s

1:21 seconds


---

House of the Undying, track 15 of the GOT S2 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZuhwPGsXzmU#t=126s

2:09 seconds


---

Mother of Dragons, track 18 of the GOT S2 OST.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=61-WS5nm_kc#t=69s

1:10 seconds. My favourite track!

---

**Lannister theme**


A pretty quiet, but very spooky theme, I suppose its meant to evoke the politicking of the Lannisters. At times, it sounds rather creepy!


---

A Raven From Kings Landing, track 7 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-rAQy1neoM

0:00 seconds, 0:14 seconds


---

A Bird Without Feathers, track 12 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UtvoSybBG68#t=74s

1:12 seconds. Very sneaky, this track plays while Cersei sympathises with Catelyn and its all emotional and sad, but near the end of the track the creepy Lannister theme comes into play.

---

Await the Kings Justice, track 13 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yxsiLOJba-Y#t=58s

0:42 seconds, 0:58 seconds

---

Black of Hair, track 18 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=67yiBxS23DQ#t=51s

0:51 seconds, 1:12 seconds. Played almost in reverse if that makes sense. It fits in with the scene its played in, which you can probably guess from the title, which does refer to a sort of reverse/secret Lannister type of scenario.

---

Small Pack of Wolves, track 20 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=w0lwUOfzDO8#t=81s

1:21 seconds. Subtle, but Im pretty sure those drawn-out notes follow the progression of the Lannister theme.

---

The Throne Is Mine, track 2 of the GOT S2 OST.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6OzWvUktaU8#t=150s

2:30 seconds. Awesome transition from the Iron Throne theme into the Lannister theme.

---

**Nights Watch theme**

A very simple theme, but also a majestic and strong one. Suits the Nights Watch, I think.

---

The Nights Watch, track 27 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-9xqq7xAWBs#t=43s

0:43 seconds, 0;53 seconds. Awesome, proud, strong rendition of the Nights Watch theme.    

---

The Wall, track 8 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=aqqqtqy77so#t=59s

0:59 seconds


---

Jons Honor, track 17 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=tyKeDaZSBns#t=12s


0:12 seconds, repeated a few times.

---

At the end of that Season the Night's watch is confronted with a seemingly gigantic army of zombies and white walkers. Sam Tarly is literally feet away from them and even makes eye contact with one of the White walkers. 

Cut to the start of Season 3 and the seemingly small band of Night's Watch brothers have defeated this army and saved Sam. How did they manage this? Is it explained in the books more? I haven't read the books at all and would like to avoid major spoilers but if there's some explanation from the book I'd like to hear it.

I dont have a problem with them changing things normally, but here I think theyve created a really confusing narrative. As far as I can tell, theyre trying to [vague season 3 speculation](#g ""force a plot twist in there later in Season 3 that they really dont have to.  As a result, theyve shot themselves in the foot a bit. The current plot is so confusing that the twist later is not going to have a twist payoff, but is instead going to have more of a oh, so thats what all that nonsense was about, glad they finally explained it feel to it."")  Now, watching it knowing whats happening has actually really fun for me so far, but I feel like theyre specifically catering to book readers in that regard, and I dont know if thats really a good choice.


Lets look at how events have been presented, solely by referencing what we see on the show, and adding no context from the books (keep in mind that show viewers have had NO indication of [ACOK/ASOS](#b ""any Bolton treachery or Ramsays insanity"")):

Season 2:

-Theon takes Winterfell

-Roose Bolton sends his bastard to retake it.

-Along with the army going to Winterfell, they make an offer to the other Ironborn to give Theon up.

-When the Bolton army is outside Winterfell, the Ironborn take them up on this offer, knock Theon out, and head home.

-Winterfell is set on fire.  (This is the first WTF moment.  How and why did this happen?  The way it looks in the show, the Ironborn did this while surrendering to an army of Northmen?  It makes no sense for them to do that, but no other explanation is given.)


Season 3 (so far):


-Roose Bolton tells Robb that the Ironborn burned down Winterfell before his bastard got there, and then escaped. (Based on what we saw last season, this was clearly not the case, and is by far the most confusing thing about this plotline.  Show watchers are totally left guessing what the hell is going on.  [Just to not give too much away on what MIGHT be happening, I'll tag this as Season 3 speculation](#g ""Was that some *other* army outside Winterfell at the end of season 2?  Is Boltons bastard just lying? Is Roose Bolton himself lying?  Why would either of them do that? Have we just totally missed something?""))

-Theon is being tortured by some unknown guys for some unknown reason.  (Again contradicting the story that the Ironborn escaped Winterfell, and just serving to confuse matters further, because we dont know where he is or who hes with).


Now, knowing what I do from the books, I can tell theyre setting up for [ACOK/ASOS](#b ""some big reveal regarding  Ramsay, and possibly incorporating that into a reveal of Rooses own treachery"").   Even if its explained later though, the whole mess right now frankly just feels sloppy and hard to follow.  If I had only been watching the show, I would be absolutely confused as shit by all this.  I will say that maybe some people could figure out some of whats happening just based on how much the show has [ACOK/ASOS](#b ""been shining a bright spotlight on the Bolton house sigil the last couple of episodes, which looks suspiciously like Theons predicament""), but still, there is no reason to hide whats going on like this.


**TL;DR: Theyve unnecessarily been hiding a lot of things going on in Theons story, and it makes the narrative confusing and frustrating to watch.**

If Im way off-base here, let me know, but I feel like if I didnt already know what was going on, Id be getting pissed off at this plotline by now.  If any show only people want to tell me Im wrong, and that they totally follow whats going on, thatd be great too.  Just want to know Im not crazy.",32,15,False,self,,,,,

How do you think the show should handle Tyrion &amp; Sansa's wedding? I really feel like they can use it as a real shocker moment.

In the novel Tywin tells Tyrion prior to the event that he will be marrying Sansa, but I think that need to hold off with Tyrion being involved, pretty much, right up until Sansa gets to the alter.

It could work really well if we just see Sansa being prepared for the ceremony and complaining that she doesn't want to to marry this person (who remains unnamed). We could then get Joffrey walking Snasa to the ceremony, while making some non-imp japes and then when she's stood at the alter BAM it's Tyrion!!

Following my weekly series ([here's the last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1bfktk/followup_for_nonreaders_valar_dohaeris/)) here's some trivia that will get you closer to what book readers know at this point of the story. This followup can greatly increase your viewer experience by expanding your knowledge of Westeros without lurking into spoiler-heavy fansites. This is a TV series subreddit for all viewers, after all, not Event Anticipation Club.

**TL;DR: Stay a non-reader, but learn facts about the events so you're on par with readers! Not interested? Upvote for spoiler-free content!**

The episode's title is quite obvious - ""dark words"" brought on ""dark wings"" of the ravens.

**Starks, Reeds, Direwolves: Two by Two**

&gt; ""Your father told you about rebellion? My never did. But I saw that, too"" - Jojen Reed, drawing the readers to the edge of their seats

* REEDS! Why are the readrs so excited? Well, they were with Bran for a long time in A Clash of Kings (book two). As a part of Robb's deal with the Freys (S01E09, The Twins), two Walder boys stayed in Winterfell as hosts. Reeds, children of a lesser lord from the swamps, proved to be much better companions than the mean Frey boys and it was them, not Osha, who talked to Bran about his wolf dreams back in Winterfell. Due to cast cuts their storyline got pushed from S2 to S3.

* Howland Reed was the only man who got back alive with Ned from his failed attempt to rescue Lyanna Stark. Bran knew that story and that's why he trusts the Reed kids. They're not just some random creepy rangers.

* The term used in the books for non-wolf spooky future dreams is ""greenseeing"". Jojen has the greensight but isn't a warg, Orell (the Wildling guy) is a warg but not a greenseer, Bran has potential to be both a warg and a greenseer.

* Rickon... well, they do a great job of making him awkward in the plot. Lots of jokes that readers make come from his unspecified place in the story. What you've seen so far (nutcracking, randomly running away) suits his book image quite well.

**Robb and his Bannermen: The Grim Beardy Stinking Camp**

&gt; ""I think you lost the war the day you married her"" - Rickard Karstark, speaking his general opinion about marriage

* On a serious note - if you don't remember - by marrying Talisa, Robb broke his vow to lord Frey of the Twins and lost a part of his army.

* Riverrun is the place where a lot of action in ACOK occurs (for example, Jaime is being held there). Same as with Reeds: to ease the growth of the cast, the Tullys got pushed to S3. Get ready to meet the rest of Catelyn's family.

* Karstarks have ""stark"" in their name for a reason - they have common ancestors with Starks of Winterfell. Their sigil is a white sun on a black field (you might have noticed this symbol in the army) and their words are a nice pun ""Sun of Winter"" (word game with the sigil and ""Son of Winter"", them being descendants of the winter-is-coming Starks).

**Theon Greyjoy: The Flayed Man**

&gt; ""AAARRRGGGHHH"" - Theon, trying to make an impression he already got enough for what he did

* If you plan on reading the books, do it now and do it fast. What happened to Theon Greyjoy after the sack of Winterfell is a mystery not only in *A Storm of Swords* (book 3), but even in *A Feast for Crows* (book 4). His disappearence is somewhat intriguing, so this is something the watchers are ahead of the readers about, at this point.

* All elements needed to understand the situation are in this episode: you know that the men of Roose Bolton, lord of Dreadfort, were sent to take Winterfell back from the Iron Islanders. I believe this episode is the first time we've seen the Bolton flag exposed so well, so it's easy to connect the dots.

* You might reconsider letting your younger siblings watch this show. HINT: It's not the ""nothing worse than that can happen"" case.

**Brienne and Jaime: The Buddy Comedy**

&gt; ""It's a shame the Throne wasn't made of cocks, they would've never got him off it"" - Jaime Lannister, maxing out the Jokes perk

* Yup, up till this point the story has quite slight deviations from the book. ENJOY THE RIDE.

**King's Landing: The Dubrovnik**

&gt; ""Lemoncakes are my favourite"" - Sansa, being Sansa

* Tyrell sigil is the rose, hence *Queen of Thorns*. I still think Maggie Smith would've been even better for that role since everyone would immediately respect a character played by her. Anyway, the readers have a little bit wider spectrum of characters, Lord Tyrell included, but they're quite irrelevant to the plot at this point.

* You might suspect this isn't gonna end well for Sansa, but in the book she was completely safe to say whatever she wants since lady Olenna asked the minstrel to sing very loudly a very dirty song, distracting just about everyone. The ambiguity and hilarious lyrics of the song is probably what got it cut off the show - it would steal not only the crowd's attention, but the audience's as well. The song is titled ""The Bear and The Maiden Fair"". You can listen to a fan cover [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6VMSYIXCCY), but there is a possibility the show will deliver the song in one of the following episodes.

* At this point of the story, Littlefinger doesn't directly approach Sansa. This simplification straightens this plot a little bit. Instead, we see ser Dontos (remember that drunken knight from S02E01, cameoing as juggler in S02E09?) trying to contact her.

* Similar with Margaery. In the books, Renly's sexual preferences are just as vaguely hinted as Stannis's relations to Melissandre and Jon Snow's parentage (okay, the last one is much, much more subtle). The show delivers these facts quite blatantly, while you could completely fail to connect the dots while reading the books. Margaery's fake innocence is another example - in the books, we see her mostly through the eyes of Sansa, who's still quite oblivious about people's real intentions. Props for writers and the actress.

**North: The Mountain Walk**

&gt; ""I forbid you to die"" - Jeor Mormont, once again delivering a very generic line

* I'm not sure if that detail is yet to be covered, but Mance has been lurking south of the Wall by himself. He even attended the feast in Winterfell, posing as a minstrel (S01E01). The fact that Tormund looks more like a barbarian king than Mance is an important feature of Mance: he's not supposed to look imposing.

* By now you've heard the term ""warg"" twice. Fans use it also as a verb (as in ""to warg into something"").

* Budget cuts! ASOS opens with a dark, scary battle between Night's Watch and the White Walkers. We're missing some actions but the ouctome is the same: some living people became dead people and the dead people didn't really get any deader.

**Brotherhood Without Banners: Robin Hood as a Tertiary Character**

&gt; ""Maybe [Hot Pie] is the reason half the country's starving"" - Thoros of Myr, runner-up at the Best Joke of the Episode contest

* The song, again. Yeah, that's the same as in ""Blackwater"". In Westeros it's the most popular song at the time being, having multiple adaptations by various bards. Long story short, it's about Tywin Lannister slaughtering the houses who rebelled against his father.

* Thoros of Myr has been known for using a burning sword. In AGOT (book 1) he participates in the melee and Lannisters meant to use the general chaos that his flaming blade would cause (as he was a known drunkard at the time) to cover up ""accidental"" death of King Robert Baratheon in said melee. Plan A didn't go through, though.

* Anguy the archer has participated in the Hand's tournament as well, in the archery competition (next to jousting and melee, but naturally omitted in the show). Of course, he won that one.

* Thoros of Myr is a red priest of R'hllor. For the book readers his relation to Melissandre remains unknown, but from the teasers it looks like we may get some answers. Expect the readers to spam the subreddit with speculation tags in related discussions.

That's about it. If you have any questions, my fellow readers are eager to answer. Any critical commentary is more than welcome since I intend this to be a weekly series.

I am trying to find a fairly accurate map with information about the Noble houses mentioned until now in the books (Unfortunately, houses lesser than Noble have not enough territorial information to be depicted in my opinion)

I would imagine it as depicting the 9 regions of westeros in different color overlay and inside each one of them it could be a sub region with the territory of their Noble houses in a slightly darker color depth

I am currently using galanix's awesome interactive map

 and this gem
(http://quartermaester.info/)
also i use the standard maps :D

Any suggestion for this kind of maps i described would be more than welcome! ;D

The second season was solid as well. But now, the third season is kinda killing me. 

First, I realize that you can't make any show or movie just like a book. It just doesn't work, as they are different media and artforms. 

And one thing I *massively* appreciate about this show, is that it gives a wonderful visual depiction that helps my mind fill in the books (as if more description was needed. Any more and it would be a Robert Jordan novel...) for faces, accents, etc. This is really nice and it does a wonderful job at it so far.

But, that doesn't mean that some things being done with the season so far are great ideas. Here's what I'm afraid they are butchering: 

0. **Overall pacing** - Whoa boy, slow on down. No really. Slow down. I know it sucks terribly for an episode to go by and think, ""Well, nothing happened there"" but at the rate they are moving they are going to outpace George RR Martin's writing speed. Slow down, take some time to fill in some more details and characters. Write George, write like the wind, or they are going to outpace you in 2014...
1. **Wildings &amp; The North** - Perhaps its because of needing to keep with a budget, but the army of Wildlings feels very small. I was hoping to be in awe and wonder. Mance feels nowhere near as charismatic as I was expecting. 
2. **Jamie &amp; Brienne** - Their relationship feels boring, whereas at this point in the books there's definitely a wonderful tension occurring between the two. Also, the sword fight on the bridge was nowhere near as good as I was hoping.
3. **Bran &amp; friends** - I don't like the way they've altered the order of things with his traveling companions, his visions/dreams, nor the instant super-powers they've assigned to Jojen. Why has he seen everything already? Its like they've taken what happens to Bran when he's later on, and assigned it to Jojen. Also seems like a terrible writing plot hole. 
5. **Reek/Theon** - While we haven't seen much yet I just get the feeling that we're going to skip too much here, including perhaps the entire Reek thing. 
6. **Makeup artists** - Everyone's too damn pretty. Tyrion is supposed to be one step above a monster at this point. Brienne is too pretty. She's supposed to look like she fell of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Instead, she looks like the average woman without makeup. Can't fault the actress for it, but the makeup artist I can. Also, worried that Reek will still be a good looking guy when its all over, when he should be completely used up and prematurely aged from torture. 

Overall, I'm happy with the series, but its feeling rushed and ""compact"" in my view. Its not breathing well. Thank god they didn't (foolishly) try to do this as a multi-part movie. ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm inclined to believe that this scene is a possible foreshadowing of Lady Stoneheart resurrecting Jon from his apparent death at the hands of the Night's Watch. This of course requires that she be able to pass on life just as Beric did.

If she considers her failure to act as a mother to Jon the cause of all the suffering her family has endured then perhaps reviving him would fulfill her believed debt to the seven. By giving life to Jon, she would effectively become a mother to him and he a son to her. Ending Cat's character arc with redemption for her treatment of Jon and with an emphasis on family first (before duty and honor) seems wonderfully poetic to me.

I'm sure there are plenty of problems with this concept, but again I just felt it an interesting take on possible events.",15,7,False,self,,,,,

- When Tywin Lannister was stuck at Harrenhal during season 2, he was reluctant to help at King's Landing as it would leave Casterly Rock open to attack from the Starks. As Tywin did end up at King's Landing, is Robb currently planning to attack Casterly Rock? I don't think his plans have been explained yet.

- Whereabouts is Astapor on the map (where Daenerys is buying the Unsullied)? Essos or somewhere else?

If it does, i'm taking it as confirmation how important the story is to the overall plot since the show pares down the books to just the essentials. It seems to be the story of the events that lead up to Robert's Rebellion. Some very interesting things to extrapolate, like how Rhaegar Targeryan came to meet Lyanna Stark, who Jon Snow's mother is, why the Reeds care for the Starks.  Here's the text of the story:

""There was one knight,"" said Meera, ""in the year of the false spring.  The Knight of the Laughing Tree, they called him.  He might have been a crannogman, that one.""

""Or not, "" Jojen's face was dappled with green shadows.  ""prince Bran has heard that tale a hundred times, I'm sure.""

""No,"" said Bran.  ""I haven't.  And if I have it doesn't matter.  Sometimes Old Nan would tell the same story she'd told before, but we never minded, if it was a good story.  Old stories are like old friends, she used to say.  You have to visit them from time to time.""

""That's true."" Meera walked with her shield on her back, pushing an occasional branch out of the way with her frog spear.  Just when Bran began to think she wasn't going to tell the story after all, she began, ""Once there was a curious lad who lived in the Neck.  He was small like all crannogmen, but b rave and smart and strong as well.  He grew up hunting and fishing and climbing trees, and learned all the magics of my people.""

Bran was almost certain he had never heard this story.  ""Did he have green dreams like Jojen?""

""No,"" said Meera, ""but he could breathe mud and run on leaves, and change earth to water and water to earth with no more than a whispered word.  He could talk to trees and weave words and make castles appear and disappear.""

""I wish I could,"" Bran said plaintively.  ""When does he meet the tree knight?""

Meera made a face at him.  ""Sooner if a certain prince would be quiet.""

""I was just asking.""

""The lad knew the magics of the crannogs,"" she continued, ""but he wanted more.  Our people seldom travel far from home you know.  We're a small folk, and our ways seem queer to some, so the big people do not always treat us kingly.  But this lad was bolder than most, and one day when he had grown to manhood he decided he would leave the crannogs and visit the Isle of Faces.""

""No one visits the Isle of Faces."" objecxted Bran.  ""That's where the green men live.""

""It was the green men he meant to find.  So he donned a shirt sewn with bronze scales, like mine, took up a leathern shield and a three-pronged spear, like mine, and paddled a little skin boat down the Green Fork.""

Bran closed his eyes to try and see the man in his little skin boat.  In his head, the crannogman looked like Jojen, only older and stronger, and dressed like Meera.

""He passed beneath the Twins by night so the Freys would not attack him, and when he reached the Trident he climbed from the river and put his boat on his head and began to walk.  It took him many a day, but finally he reached the Gods Eye, threw his boat in the lake, and paddled out to the Isle of Faces.""

""Did he meet the green men?""

""Yes,"" said Meera, ""But that's another story, and not for me to tell.  My prince asked for knights.""

""Green men are good too.""

""They are,"" she agreed, but said no more about them.  ""All that winter the crannogman stayed on the isle, but when spring broke he heard the wide world calling and knew the time had come to leave.  His skin boat was just where he'd left it, so he said his farewells and paddled off toward shore.  He rowed and rowed, and finally saw the distant towers of a castle rising beside the lake.  The towers reached ever higher as he neared shore, until he realized this must be the greatest castle in all the world.""

""Harrenhal!"" Bran knew at once.  ""It was Harrenhal!""

Meera smiled.  ""Was it?  Beneath it's walls he saw tents of many colors, bright banners cracking in the wind, and knights in mail and plate on barded horses.  He smelled roasting meats, and heard the sound of laughter and the blare of heralds' trumpets.  A great tourney was about to commence, and champions from all over the land had come to contest it.  The king himself was there, with his son the dragon prince.  The White Swords had come, to welcome a new brother to their ranks.  The storm lord was on hand, and the rose lord as well.  The great lion of the rock had quarreled with the king and stayed away, but many of his bannermen and knights attended all the same.  The crannogman had never seen such pageantry, and knew he might never see the like again.  Part of him wanted nothing so much as to be part of it.""

Bran knew that feeling well enough.  When he'd been little, all he had ever dreamed of was being a knight.  But that had been before he fell and lost his legs.

""The daughter of the great castle reigned as queen of love and beauty when the tourney opened.  Five champions had sworn to defend her crown; her four brothers of Harrenhal, and her famous uncle, a white knight of the Kingsguard.""

""Was she a fair maid?""

""She was,"" said Meera, hopping over a stone, ""but there were others fairer still.  One was the wife of the dragon prince, who'd brought a dozen lady companions to attend her.  The knights all begged them for favors to tie about their lances.""

""This isn't going to be one of those love stories, is it?"" Bran asked suspiciously.  ""Hodor doesn't like those so much.""

""Hodor,"" said Hodor agreeably.

""He likes the stories where the knights fight monsters.""

""Sometimes the knights are the monsters, Bran.  The little crannogman was walking across the field, enjoying the warm spring day and harming none, when he was set upon by three squires.  They were none older than fifteen, yet even so they were bigger than him , all three.  This was their world, as the saw it, and he had no right to be there.  They snarched away his spear and knicked him to the ground, cursing him for a frogeater.""

""Were they Walders?""  It sounded like something Little Walder Frey might have done.

""None offered a name, but he marked their faces well so he could revenge himself upon them later.  They shoved him down every time he tried to rise, and kicked him when he curled up on the ground.  But then they heard a roar.  'That's my father's man you're kicking,' howled the she-wolf.""

""A wolf on four legs, or two?""

""Two,"" said Meera.  ""The she-wolf laid into the squires with a tourney sword, scattering them all.  The crannogman was bruised and bloodied, so she took him back to her lair to clean his cuts and bind them up with linen.  There he met her pack brothers: the wild wolf who led them, the quiet wolf beside him, and the pup who was youngest of the four.

""That evening there was to be a feast in Harrenhal, to mark the opening of the tourney, and the she-wolf insisted that the lad attend.  He was of high birth, with as much a right to a place on the bench as any other man.  She was not easy to refuse, this wolf maid, so he let the young pup find him garb suitable to a king's feast, and went up to the great castle.

""Under Harren's roof he ate and drank with the wolves, and many of their s worn swords besides, barrowdown men and moose and bears and mermen.  The dragon prince sang a song so sad it made the wolf maid sniffle, but when her pup brother teased her for crying she poured wine over his head.  A black brother spoke, asking the knights to join the Night's Watch.  The  storm lord drank down the knight of skulls and kisses in a wine-cup war.  The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf...but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.

""Amidst all this merriment, the little crannogman spied the three squires who'd attacked him.  One served a pitchfork knight, one a porcupine, while the last attended a knight with two towers on his surcoat, a sigil all crannogmen know well.""

The Freys,"" said Bran.  ""The Freys of the Crossing.""

""Then, as now,"" she agreed.  ""The wolf maid saw them too, and pointed them out to her brothers.  'I could find you a horse, and some armor that might fit,' the pup offered.  The little crannogman thanked him, but gave no answer.  His heart was torn.  Crannogmen are smaller than must, but just as proud.  The lad was no knight, no more than any of his people.  We sit a boat more offtent then a horse, and our hands are made for oars, not lances.  Much as he wished to have his vengeance, he freared he would only make a fool of himself and shame his people.  The quiet wolf had offered the little crannogman a place in his tent that night, but before he slept he knelt on the lakeshore, looking across the water to where the Isle of Faces would be. and said a prayer to the old gods of north and Neck...""

""You never heard this tale from your father?"" asked Jojen.

""It was Old Nan who told the stories.  Meera, go on, you can't stop there.""

Hodor must have felt the same.  ""Hodor,"" he said, and then, ""Hodor hodor hodor hodor.""

""Well,"" said Meera, ""if you would hear the rest...""

""Yes,  Tell it.""

""Five days of jousting were planned,"" she said.  ""There was a great seven-sided melee as well, and archery and axe-throwing, a horse race, and tourney of singers...""

""Never mind about all that."" Bran squirmed impatiently in his basket on Hodor's back.  ""Tell about the jousting.""

""As my prince commands.  The daughter of the castle was queen of love and beauty, with four brothers and an uncle to defend her, but all four sons of Harrenhal were defeated on the first day.  Their conquerors reigned briefly as champions, until they were vanquished in turn.  As it happened the end of the first day saw the porcupine knight win a place among the champions, and on the morning of the second day the pitchfork knight and the knight of the two towers were victorious as well.  But late on the afternoon of that second day, as the shadows grew long, a mystery knight appeared in the lists.""

Bran nodded sagely.  Mystery knights would oft appear at tourneys, with helms concealing their faces, and shields that were either blank or bore some strange device.  Sometimes they were famous champions in disguise, the Dragonknight once won a t ourney as the Knight of Tears, so he could name his sister the queen of love and beauty in place of the king's mistress.  And Barristan the Bold twice donned a mystery knight's armor, the first time when he was only ten.  ""It was the little crannogman, I bet.""

""No one knew,"" said Meera, ""but the mystery knight was short of stature, and clad in ill-fitting armor made up of bits and pieces.  The device upon his shield was a heart tree of the old gods, a white weirwood with a laughing red face.""

""Maybe he came from the Isle of Faces,"" said Bran.  ""Was he green?"" In Old Nan's stories the guardians had dark green skin and leaves instead of hair.  Sometimes they had antlers too, but Bran didn't  see how the mystery knight could have worn a helm if he had antlers.  ""I bet the old gods sent him.""

""Perhaps they did. The mystery knight dipped his lance before the king and rode to the end of the lists, where the five champions had their pavilions.  You know the three he challenged.""

""The porcupine knight, the pitchfork knight, and the knight of the twin towers.""  Bran had heard enough stories to know that.  ""He was the little crannogman, I told you.""

""Whoever he was, the old gods gave strength to his arm.  The porcupine knight fell first, then the pitchfork knight, and lastly the knight of the two towers.  None were well loved, so the common folk cheered lustily for the Knight of the Laughing Tree, as the new champion soon was called.  When his fallen foes sought to ransom horse and armor, the Knight of the Laughing Tree spoke in a booming voice through his helm, saying, 'Teach your squires honor, that shall be ransom enough.'  Once the defeated knights chastised their squires sharply, their horses and armour were returned.  And so the little crannogman's prayer was answered...by the green men, or the old gods, or the children of the forest, who can say?""

It was a good story, Bran decided after thinking about it a moment or two.  ""Then what happened, Did the Knight of the Laughing Tree win the tourney and marry a princess?""

""No,"" said Meera.  ""That night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each sword they would unmask him, and the king himself urged men to challenge him,, declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of his.  But the next morning, when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took his seat, only two champions appeared.  The Knight of the Laughing Tree had vanished.  The king was wroth, and even sent his son the dragon prince to seek the man, but  all they ever found was his painted shield, hanging abandoned in a tree.  It was the dragon prince who won that tourney in the end.""

""Oh.""  Bran thought about the tale awhile.  ""That was a good story.  Bit it should have been the three bad knights who hurt him, not their squires.  Then the little crannogman could have killed them all.  The part about the ransoms was stupid.  And the Mystery knight should win the tourney, defeating every challenger, and name the wolf maid the queen of love and beauty.""

""She was,"" Said Meera, ""but that's a sadder story.""

""Are  you certain you never heard this tale before Bran?"" asked Jojen.  ""Your lord father never told it to you?""",31,25,False,self,,,,,

I hope everything about this submisson is correct.

I'm watching the series (haven't read the books yet), and in the new season there are a few things that confuse me.

One was the frozen dead man, a member of the night's watch, in episode 1. I think when the others found Samwell. I just thought it was one of the two guys he and Jon were with, who ran for it when the White Walkers appeared, but they are both alive in Episode 2. So who was this guy? Was he someone important, or just some unknown guy?

The other thing was the ""fight"" Arya had in the tavern. I understand that she can't win against a fullgrown man who has a lot of fighting experience, but I would have thought that she has learned by now not to get her sword knocked out of her hand. What were all those dancing lessons for, if they apparently had no effect at all? Why did she lose so clearly and fast?",13,4,False,self,,,,,

It's good but nothing has happened in 2 seasons. It just builds for something that doesn't come, or hasn't."" which my friends are going mad about. But then I explain what I mean, which is, the things that they spoke of happening in the very first episode hasn't even happened yet and this seems to happen a lot over the whole two seasons so far. I watched from first episode to the current in about a week, so maybe as I am rushing the episodes I am expecting something to happen.

Some things that haven't happened yet: ""Winter is coming"" - Two seasons winter hasn't arrived. White Walkers - Only just showed up, but heard of them in first episode. Stark vs Lannister war - damn thats slow. The other guys started after and went to war before they did (Sorry I forget name of all the houses), heck the ones they went to for help have already taken their castle and burned it while they are still planning to attack. It's taken the dragon lady god knows how long to find a damn boat.

So the show to me is like they are building up for an event, something HUGE. Which it probably will be, dragons vs white walkers vs humans who are all fighting each other already. But they have been speaking of this event for 2 seasons. 2 seasons of prep work. It's like watching The Walking Dead where the outbreak hasn't happened yet, but you know it's going to happen. But 2 seasons of build up, it's going to be 3 seasons of build up by the looks of it. Season 4 will probably be where stuff actually happens.

But anyway, I do like the show, as do many others. But I can't really see where my friends are coming from saying that I'm wrong about not much happening so far. Does this make sense to anyone or am I just misunderstanding the show?",8,0,False,default,,,,,

I've just started watching the show and it's great so far. I want to start watching it with my girlfriend, but excessive sex scenes in stuff makes her uncomfortable (and no, there's nothing wrong with that or our relationship, she just doesn't like watching sex on TV).

I've been checking up on whether the show contains a lot of fleshy fumbling because I've heard it has a reputation for it. So far I've found about as many places that have said it's relatively tame as places that claim it's a constant barrage of juicy rumplings. Does it contain more or less as seasons go on?

I could watch it all and note the times I need to put my hand over her eyes, but I really like watching stuff with her and having it new and fresh for both of us. So any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)",21,0,False,self,,,,,

We decided to do a death pool like some people do with celebrities coming into the year. We did ours in a fantasy sport draft style, with everyone picking one character at a time in a random order decided beforehand from a list of about 64 characters whom we all agreed were fair game to die. Also, the draft order reverses each round (so it's 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5...)

Each character is allowed to be picked twice, meaning that, with 6 of us, we all ended up with a team of 20 characters. Each time one on your list dies, you get one point. The person with the most points at the end of the season is the grand winner of the pool. We didn't put any money in, so it's just for fun.

I just wanted to share the idea here in case other people wanted to organize something similar. We did our draft last night after watching episode two of the season, so there's still time to make one happen! No one's died yet.

If people are interested in making their own pools, I'd be willing to post the list of characters we had.",0,0,False,default,,,,,

Ranking of Power

Olenna Redwyne +6
The Queen of Thorns made her GOT debut and boy is she one snappy broad. Clearly she is the one pulling the strings in House Tyrell.

Jaime Lannister +5
This guy has got jokes for days. Nice job getting free from Brienne, if only to be captured by someone else moments later.

Margaery Tyrell +5 (Season Total +9)
Margaery continues to spin Joff around her little finger (not that Littlefinger). She seems ~~nonplussed~~ nonchalant to learn that Sansa thinks he is a monster, because she knows how to manipulate him easily. Like grandmother like granddaughter.

Arya Stark +5
Arya hasn't lost any of her spunk and keeps up her bravado even when face to face with danger, and in the process earns mad respect from the Brotherhood Without Banners.

Brann Stark +4
Dude got super powers and puberty. Winning!

Sansa Stark +2 (Season Total 0)
Way to speak your mind, you go girl!

Mance Rayder +2 ( Season Total +8)
This week we learned Mance is a great community organizer, even so far as getting the other WIlding tribes to fight alongside Cave People. Yep, friggin' cave people.

Brienne of Tarth +1
You let your guard down and that's not cool, but you managed to bitch smack the Kingslayer a few times, so fuck it, have a point.

Shae +1
Here is to trying to get Tyrion back to his old self.

Thoros of Myr +1
Cool new character, seems like a bad ass.

Roose Bolton +1
Between having your banner men [ADWD](#b ""torture the shit out of Theon"") and having your other peeps capture Brienne and Jaimie, House Bolton is in full effect.

Jon Snow -1 (Season Total +4)
You act like you never saw a Warg before. Geez.

Tyrion Lannister (Season Total -3)
C'mon buddy, get out of this funk already!

Osha -1
You let a little girl sneak up on you and put a knife to your throat? 

Cersei Lannister -2 (Season Total -1)
You really have no idea how to control your son do you?

Cat Stark -5
Poor Cat, all of her children are scattered about Westeros and in various states of danger. Except for Robb who keeps her in handcuffs.

Robb Stark -4 (Season Total -10)
Don't you have a war you are supposed to be fighting?

Joffrey Baratheon -4 (Season Total -9)
That sash makes you feel like a fucking bad ass huh? 

Samwell Tarly -7 (Season Total -9)
Piggy. Piggy. Piggy.

Theon Greyjoy -10
Sucks to be you.

The casting of the series is, on the whole, excellent; with a quality and skilled cast. However its inevitable that with such string actors fulfilling many of the roles, any weaker ones stick out. Which actor or actress, in your opinion, is struggling within the role they occupy? Be it poor acting, lack of connection with the material or any other reason. 

For me there are the obvious candidates. I think Ros was poor but has upped her game, particularly in the early episodes of this series. For me Shae is terrible. He lines are rushed almost forced and you can almost see her regurgitating the script in her head with no depth or meaning. 

Perhaps one less common who I feel has been poor is Brienne. I realise finding a 6'3"" behemoth of a woman has its challenges; but I really think Gwendoline Christie struggles at times.

The Stark's is a great example, remember back in the first couple of chapters in Game of Thrones? Back when Eddard, Rob, Jon, Arya, Sansa, Brann, Cat- (wait no one cares about her) were all together?
It seems so far and long away, how the characters have developed since then and gone their own separate ways just depresses me.

When Robb and Jon died; it instantly took me back to the first bow and arrow scene with Brann, they were all a happy family, and it crumbled to bits within five books.

Jorah Mormont's house sigil is a bear, and his father is commonly called ""the old bear"". The story of the song describes a bear going to a fair, where he meets a beautiful woman who is unwilling. He then forces himself upon her and carries her away. Jorah tells Dany a gallant tale of how he met his wife, saying that he won her heart at a tournament and only later did she no longer love him. Could it be that he lied?


Consider that most other songs in the GoT universe seem to describe real events, sometimes as a form of gossip. Perhaps Jorah, a known slaver, kidnapped his wife and it was the talk of King's Landing for months.

I have a couple questions and I really dont want to Google them in fear of running across spoilers.

Jamie and his men attacked Stark in the middle of Kings landing.  Turns out his meb weeent the king's men...who wee ethey and why was he allowed to do it?

The kings council turned out to be leading stark on and once Robert died and his ""son"" took throne they tuened on him. Why exactly?  Was is just because of Lannister's money?

So I'm a huge fan of the TV series, which was my intro to ASOIAF. I recently purchased the books online, which are currently in transit, only to have everything I love smashed to pieces in front of me when I went on Tumblr and saw a comment [ASoS](#b ""under a picture of Richard Madden saying 'Too bad he gets his head chopped off' "").

In a fit of despair, I queried the ASOIAF wiki about it and after a lengthy spate of spoiling anything and everything related to the series, I found myself on the other end horrified at the tremendous emotional self-harm I had just committed. 

I know that my behaviour was deplorable (I probably should have just doubted the sincerity of the comment and went about my merry way), but alas, I find myself in a state of questioning whether I should read the books or continue watching the series, given that the unpredictable nature of the series is a huge part of what keeps me engaged with it.

So, those of you who are up-to-date on the books - am I overreacting here? Is there still hope of me enjoying the series given that I know the fate of a lot of the characters? ",11,0,False,default,,,,,

But watching last week's episode showed [ep3.02](#s Theon being tortured). I powered through ASOS right after last season ended, so it's been awhile since I read it. My question is if [ep3.02](#Theon's torture) occurred during ASOS or if this is a bit of AFFC (or ADWD?) seeping forward into the third season of the show. And if so, how might this bend the narratives of this season and the following ones?

We then went on to watch the first episode together and I was so shocked at how brutal the Dothraki seemed. Obviously, they've never been the most relaxed bunch, but it was so much more horrific than in later episodes. Then it occured to me how much of Game of Thrones is effected by the 'unreliable narrator' format. Are the Dothraki really more savage to begin with, and Dany and her relationship with Drogo causes that to change? Or do they appear less savage because Dany (The eyes for the audience) is more used to to their custom.

Similarly, I've noticed scenes for certain characters change when they become POV characters in the books, most noticeably Theon.

Not so much because of what she's doing now, but because I know what's coming.

It's confirmed that she's going to be at the Red Wedding and I'm still struggling to understand why. D&amp;D said that this is the scene that they've wanted to shoot since before they even started and they decide to make Robb bring the wife that he insulted Walder Frey with, to the wedding where he's trying to make amends with Walder Frey? How is this not illogical?

So, is there any way that this could make sense? Besides Robb just saying ""Fuck it. Ima bring my wife because it'd be too sensible not to"", is there a plotline which could explain her being there?

I suppose Lord Frey could request that she comes to the wedding but I'd find that a bit suspect if I were Robb/Cat.

I'm not sure I buy into the ""Talisa is a spy"" theory because if she is then what's to stop the Freys from killing her? They can't know she's a spy because they'd then know the marriage that insulted them was set up by Tywin and hence not want to ally with the Lannisters.

EDIT: Also, I'm hoping she buggers off to the bedding when it's time for Robb and Cat to snuff it. I'd rather the Red Wedding not being turned into a tragic young lovers story and stay with the mother and son story.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

(Spoilers ASOS),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1c4tez/where_will_sams_plotline_end_this_season_spoilers/,GRVrush2112,1365687719,"I think with most of the plot lines if the individual characters we can guess where their ASOS plots will be split and what will be held over until season 4...  The only person I have no clue about is Sam's path.. We know if the battle of the wall is being held to season 4 Sam won't return to Castle Black until then. (Though where he wasn't there in the books, I feel that will be changed an Sam will be present for the battle on the show... But that's another topic).  We can guess by the title of episode 4 (And Now His Watch is Ended) that the massacre at Craster's Keep will happen then... And hopefully ""Sam the Slayer"" will be in ep. 3....

But assuming the Battle of the Wall takes place mid-to-late season 4, that leaves just over a full season between the rest of season 3 and the first half of season 4 in which there are 2 major events to cover on Sam.

1. White Walker attack on Sam and Gilly at the abandoned village/rescue by Coldhands

2. Meetup at the Nightfort with Bran and the Reeds

So where do those events fall in?  Where will they end his arc in Season 3? And is that enough material for Sam until he gets back to the Wall mid-season 4?

_______________________

I think with some short added scenes, just to keep up with Sam, that what I listed is plenty of Sam material to keep until he returns to the Wall... So no issue there,  and from Bran's and Jon's plot threads this season (episode 6 being titled ""The Climb"" is Jon and the Wildlings scaling the Wall), that the Queenscrown scene that they share will most likely be very close to the end of their arcs for season 3, and that means that we will most likely not get the Scene at the Nightfort until early next season.

That leads me to think that the attack on Sam and Gilly/ introduction of Coldhands will be the end of Sam's season 3 arc.  The only thing that concerns me is that I've heard absolutely nothing about Coldhands being in season 3 at all.  Granted that his true identity remains unknown even onto book readers, thus being able to not have to cast that role perfectly at this point, there have been no hints of him being in this season. They could however just have some guy shrouded right at the end, and cast him proper next season (a la Beric Dondarion, or season 1 Jaqen H'ghar)

For reasons I stated above I feel that we have to have Sam reaching the Wildling Village by the end of this season at least. ( If he dosen't there will be nothing for him to do the second half of this Season.)  But the fact that nothing has been mentioned about Coldhands does worry me a bit...


Those are my thoughts, what ate your's?

The show consistantly shows that despite the power struggles, winning the throne doesn't matter-- it's all just vying for power. Varys plays the game of thrones perhaps the best of any, using *kings* as pawns at this point-- would any of us actually see him as the ultimate ""winner""?

I am only on episode 8 of the first season. 

Spoilers ahead

Lord Stark finds the book that proves that Joffre is not the kings son. How was it recorded he was not. I am assuming it is a book with all the family names. Why didn't the queen have it destroyed? Also I can't remember the name he had in the book, but did it imply or say that he is Jamieson son? 

I would Google to find these answers I don't want any spoilers. I accidentally stumbled on a huge one.

I've recently ordered the 'A Song of Ice and Fire, 7 Volumes collection' from amazon, and I was wondering if I should take the time to watch the show before reading the books. My main concerns are:

1.) Will my experience of the books be ruined by any watered down features in the show?

2.) Will any spoilers encountered in the show spoil my enjoyment of reading the books?

I have already watched the first few episodes of the show, as well as reading the first few chapters of 'A Game of Thrones'. Both are fantastic, though I would like to enjoy the full George R.R. Martin experience, thus I ask you fans of both media's what is the optimal route to achieve this?

Thankyou

I figured this topic would make for an interesting discussion, so hear me out.  This was my post:

""Something I've often thought of about Jaime: he is regarded as an excellent swordsman, but what has he done, really, to make people claim as such? Kingswood Brotherhood? He was only a squire, and can really only brag about even living through it. He also didn't do shit during Robert's Rebellion. Just about the only thing I can think of where he impressed me was cutting down 5 or 6 people during the Battle of the Whispering Wood.
Don't get me wrong, I think he is talented and he is also one of my favorite characters. I just think his skill is hyped up a bit by the characters and society throughout the series because of his birth and his appointment to the kingsguard at a young age (which was really only done by Aerys to spite Tywin by taking away his heir, not necessarily because he displayed stunning skill - remember, Aerys hated Tywin, so this action was the ultimate 'Fuck you'), and it only adds to his smug personality.""

Born heir to Casterly Rock, appointed to the Kingsguard at the age of 17 in an act of spite.  Commoners around Westeros would obviously look at his appointment as a testament to his skill, and not really know the relationship Aerys/Tywin had that lead to it.

Sex clearly sells and the makers of the show use it very well, when ever I hear or read people talk about the show they point out how you get to see boobs a lot in the episodes, but if I wanted porn, there is no doubt more than a billion videos on the internet, I want a plot driven show that entertains me, not porn.


It may be better after the first episode, but I am every now and then trying to watch the first episode but turn it off because I am just annoyed by the sexual theme throughout the entire episode.
I would gladly pay extra for this show without the nudity.


Surely I am not the only one that thinks this show is ruined with the sexual content and dialogue?

To point out, I am desperate to enjoy the show.

The decisions people (and GRRM) are making in the Game of Thrones are worse than anything the entire board of directors of Enron or General Motors could have ever come up with.  
  
Jaime trying to kill Bran  
Ned telling Cersei he knows (hahaha, what an idiot)  
Robb going to war with everyone  
Jon becoming a turncloak  
Joffrey offing Ned  
Cat releasing Jaime  
Tyrells killing Joffrey  
Shae turning on Tyrion  
Tyrion killing Tywin  
Cat and Robb assassinated at the Twins  
Zombie Cat  
Jon becoming commander of the Night's Watch  
...the list goes on and on  
  
The motivation of many characters is often vague or kept ambiguous to encourage the reader to buy the next book in the series, hoping to find more answers. In between events there is more talk and new characters added and more boring descriptions of landscapes (worse than LOTR - The Two Towers).  
  
The books are a very tough read with people popping up left and right who have a claim to the Iron Throne.  
  
I go as far to say the story thus far (and all the rest) could have easily fit into two volumes, making it much more accessible and more exciting.  
  
Had to get this off my chest and am aware I am not the first to post such a statement.

In every single way, she seems perfect. She is highly intelligent, beautiful, loved by everyone, tells everyone what they want to hear, able to charm everyone (except Cersei, of course. But Cersei trusts no one so I don't really think that counts). She is cunning and is able to appear sweet and innocent, when really she is working her way up to power.

I know they have Jojen and Meera stuff from ACOK to cover as well but I feel like there isn't really enough of Bran in ASOS to span 2 seasons. He only has 4 POV chapters.

With this in mind I have a feeling Bran's plot will stray from the books quite a bit. I expect they'll put off Osha and Rickon leaving for as long as possible, but other than that I've no idea what they might have in mind.

Any thoughts on what's in store for Bran and co. on the show for the next couple of seasons?",9,13,False,self,,,,,

I clicked on it and it actually played. It appears to have disappeared from my DVR but I am positive it was the new episode.

Things that happened in the beginning of the episode.
- Rob reprimands one of his generals for ruining his plans to lure tywin's   armies to his turf.
- Jamie and Brienne tied up on a horse, brienne telling jamie that she was unimpressed with his fighting skills.
- Rob's grandfather's funeral: his body is floating away on a boat, the designated archer shoots, misses, shoots, misses, cutaway to rob and his mother (the chuckle), misses again i think, Rob's general? takes the bow from the archer, shoots, walks away as the arrow fly's and hits the boat and it lights on fire.

This was at about 3:am AST. Has this happened with anyone else?

Then I started thinking about other historical parallels that I could draw between the show and really life. The Dothraki are obviously very similar to the Mongols, and the dichotomy between Westeros and Esos mirrors the East vs West dicotomy seen throughout history. 

Westeros is clearly shaped like Britain, making the North scotland and the Wall Hadrian's wall. The Iron Islands have a very Viking feel to them. 

I finally, made a connection between some events in the story and events in the Illiad and the Aeneid, but there were some holes in it.

So..Here goes.. 
In the books, when Bran [AFFC &amp; ADWD](#b ""and his group meet the CoTF, Bloodraven, and the whole underground gang, it is mentioned that the darkness is good, darkness and cold is our friend, per se-don't have the actualy quote""), thus taking the reference that these people might be in line with [ADWD](#b ""The Others"") and just as Jon Snow is theoretically [ADWD](#b ""Azor Ahai reborn"") won't it be cool if something like [Champion Fight Spec](#g ""Bran being the champion of the Others while Snow being the champoin for R'hlor, wherein both have to fight each other in the end"") be possible?

And they're actually pulling it off. I mean you could whine about the omission of some characters(where is Lem, and why can't I have Lem?), or changes in the story, but on the whole they are making this a spectacular addition to the series. The show has to balance appeasing the longtime fans, the casual watcher, and practicality. Those are some difficult plates to be spinning but they seem to have struck the right balance. 

I have a feeling the punk cover of Bear and The Maiden Fair is going to be quite divisive here, but it was a ballsy move that shows the showrunners are willing to take chances. If you like it or not, you gotta hand it to those guys for that decision.

Particularly that they removed Westerling for 'Talisa' and changed the whole dynamic of the story. In Season 2 Robb seems to do very little except bum around with his exotic love interest, who herself is a pretty one dimensional *strong lady with opinions, who isn't swayed by the man's position**. 

**Big spoilers, I guess** 

- Robb and 'Talisa'/Jeyne 

The point in the story was that Robb is distraught after hearing of the death of his brothers at Winterfell, so he falters and sleeps with the daughter of a minor, Lannister aligned, house. He then marries her out of his unwavering commitment to honor, even though he knowingly  dooms his alliance with the Freys. **It proves he is his father's son.** He makes an error and then can't bring himself to do something dishonorable by abandoning a girl he took the virginity from, even though he *could*. 

Instead you have Robb getting misty eyed over some exotic girl and not really caring as he throws away his own and his men's lives by not holding contract with the Freys. 

Add to that Robb didn't do all that much on screen fighting in Season 2, he just held hands with his love interest for most of the time.

- Catelyn

She is much, much stronger a leader in the books. She is a capable tactician, not just a mother who is always whining about the safe return of her children. 

She *does* show concern for her children when she hears the news Bran and Rickon have 'died', by releasing Jaime in exchange for Sansa and Arya, which is a tactically perilous move.

Again this is ruined, because in the show Catelyn releases Jaime because?... She can't control her own men while Robb is absent? It's very unclear. She chucks away an absolutely necessary bargaining chip, not due to grief, but due to her own lack of leadership ability.

I enjoyed the newly created Arya and Tywin storyline for the show, but I am still annoyed by how much they changed the Robb Stark/Catelyn arc. It's now pretty cliched and meaningless. A doting mother who sighs for her children at every turn and a boy conqueror who dooms himself with a sordid affair with a foreigner.

Honor doesn't doom Robb any more, only his cock. ",8,6,False,self,,,,,

Seriously. Fuck. That was an amazing ending to an episode. Honestly, it was my favorite episode ending in the series. More so than Blackwater, Baelor, Fire and Blood, or Valar Morghulis. I have to really give credit to David Benioff (this was the first episode of the series that he's directed, if I'm not mistaken). The way the moment was shot was perfect for the feel of it. It wasn't some big moment that was built up. It was unannounced, and completely out of nowhere. I *never* expected them to cut off Jaime's hand in the book, and it was incredibly shocking.

That's the way the scene felt. I know they changed a lot by removing the Goat and the Brave Companions, but this honestly redeemed that move in my eyes. Locke wasn't out to save his own skin from Tywin when he cut off Jaime's hand. Seriously, he did it out of some sort of sadism and spite. I know it's going to end up biting him in the ass later (poor forethought, there), but that was a really powerful moment. He gives Jaime a cutting (I'm so sorry for that...) speech about how worthless he is without his dad, and then he decides, ""You know what? I'm going to chop your hand off. Just to fucking do it.""

And *showing it*. That's the greatest part. You just see it happen, and for a split second it doesn't register, and then you go, ""Oh *fuck*, he just chopped off Jaime's hand!"" It plays out to the viewer how it did for Jaime: dumb shock, and then the magnitude of it hits.

Now, I know that some people weren't happy with the end credits song, but, honestly, I loved that too. The sheer contrast of the previous moment to the upbeat song was almost like a bit of morbid comedy. Like a lighthearted middle finger to the viewer. It was ballsy, and I thought it worked.

In closing, bravo. This is the moment that will be kicking off the shitstorm that will be the rest of this season, and it did its job beautifully. Things are going to be *crazy* from now on.

*Dany as we know is a Targaryen

*I believe Jon Snow is a Targaryen

*I believe Tyrion is actually a Targaryen


*Jon is Ice

*Dany is Fire

*Tyrion is neutral


*Dany has blonde hair

*Snow has dark hair

*Tyrion's hair is a mix in the show - not true blonde, not true black

*Each of them represent one of the dragons

*All 3 killed their mothers during birth - I picked up on this bit when Melisandre mentioned sacrifices for black magic - Maybe the mothers were the sacrifices and in return the eggs of the dragons were gifted for the sacrifices given

*Tyrion's mother was raped by the Mad King and Tyrion is his and has his blood so he is half Targaryen. Tywin learnt of the rape and kickstarted the rebellion in which Jamie Lannister eventually killed The Mad King. The attack on the Mad King was revenge for the rape of Tywin's wife. The reason Tywin dislikes Tyrion so much is that it reminds him of what The Mad King did to his wife/Tyrion's mother. Also the fact Tywin knows of the rape also does not mean he knows who the father of Tyrion is as rape does not automatically equal pregnancy and its likely Tywin had sex with his wife in a similar period to any rape. He cannot get a DNA test so if he did kill Tyrion he could be killing his own son, even if he suspects Tyrion is not his. He has told Tyrion 'you are no son of mine' and I think he believes it but cannot find conclusive evidence to prove it and kill him

*Tyrion is the only one of the three Lannister children with the trademark 'Ty' for the beginning of his name also. Surely it is possible this was done as to try and convince everyone he was a true Lannister.

*Tywin refuses to give Tyrion Casteley Rock - I believe this is because he knows he could be placing it back in the hands of Targaryen and he despises them. Tyrion also never got credit for his service in the battle and his great idea. Why?

Think about it. What really happened at the end of season 1? Some dragons were born, a character died, and there was sex. 

Season 2 - People get angry, there is more sex, witty commentary, more death, odd fore-shadowing, and twisted and highly integrated plotlines. 

In reality, the main difference between the book and the show is that there is much more left to the imagination. The show won't show what a battle was like (budget, time, etc) but the book won't lead on who could possibly win until the end. For that reason alone, it seems that the show is way more predictable than the book.

Podrick Payne is clearly miscast, and it was so obvious this episode.  He is supposed to be timid, stuttering, and completely unsure of himself.  I can't imagine how book Podrick would react to a brothel.  The jokes about him being a sex master were absurd.  The books have so many great things to them, and this scene was what they thought the audience would benefit the most from?

Bear and the Maiden Fair:  Jamie's moment is character defining.  Things will never be the same after what Vargo Hoat did to him.  Insert rowdy barroom drinking song to end the episode.  It didn't fit, and it left me baffled.

There were some great moments, such as the teasing conversation between Jamie and Brieanne.  Arya's almost confrontation of the Hound, aswell as her goodbye to Hotpie.  Also thank the Seven that we were spared Catalyn's 2-3 chapters of being bedside to Edmure Tully.

I said before and I'll say again, to really be safe from spoilers, read the books first and then come back here, or simply don't read any sites about GOT (but obviously it's completely up to you what you do).

Good stuff

Even more they put in how his one victory of the war was more of a mistake, and he gets chastised because of it.  But correct me if I'm wrong, but his mistake was a bit more monumental in the book iirc.  Instead of trapping the Mountain and being able to kill him, wasn't it that if Edmure had not ridden out Tywin would have been trapped in The Riverlands and would not have been able to make it to King's Landing for the battle of Blackwater?  

I don't mind that small change, Edmure's mistake is mostly the same, the consequences are just a bit different, though saying that Tywin would not have been able to make it to KL in time had Edmure been patient, elevates his fuck up much more than ""just being unable to capture the Mountain""...

Okay. You know how Daenerys is about to buy her slave army? Well I had some thoughts on that. 

So, she abhors slavery. She tries to give water to the dying slave. She keeps making a big deal how she's buying slaves and she's feel mixed about it. Everyone keeps telling her that these slave soldiers are hardcore. They'll kill anyone, do anything she says. They'll even kill themselves were she to command it. 

Then, Barristan keeps telling her she needs an army loyal to her because they love her. That slaves wont fight like men loyal to her will. 

Then she makes a bold move: she offers to buy every soldier, plus all the ones in training. She's even willing to trade one of her dragons for them. 


[Now, how about this:](#g ""What if she gets her slave army, then orders them to attack the city they came from?
This would serve two purposes. One, she gets to recoup her costs and her dragon. Then two, the soldiers have destroyed their former masters and now feel loyal to Daenerys because she gave them freedom and revenge. The city itself would be defenseless because all of their soldiers, even the ones in training, have just be sold off. "")

It doesn't matter if it's a spoiler from book one or the episode last night.  Major theories also need tags; that's what the green tag is for.

*EDIT: Please note that spoiler ""hinting"" and ""teasing"" is not ok.  Book readers need to tag their book comments with book spoiler tags.  Don't try to harass non-readers; nobody likes a troll.*

Posts made without warnings are removed, so don't expect to get any of that sweet karma for your joke post if you don't include a title warning.  Posting spoilers without warning is also a good way to get your account banned.  Sometimes the mods will ban immediately if a post is a really obvious/careless problem, so don't expect to get away with just a warning spoilers because you don't feel like taking the time to do a tag, or you're on your phone and don't want to wait to look up the code later.  

If you haven't already, read the [Posting Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy).  That will tell you want kind of content is ok.  Posting out-of-scope just wastes everyone's time because mods remove bad posts.  We'd rather spend time watching out for spoilers, so please keep the posts relevant.  The [Spoiler Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide) is also good for finding out what kinds of spoilers are moderated.  We follow the ""everybody lives"" rule found in many subs, allow name+book for better warnings to prevent big spoiling, and have a few specific exceptions for certain information that's become ""too mainstream"" to moderate anymore.  If you're not sure about what's a spoiler, check the guide, or [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) to ask.  

And as always, if you see a problem post, report it.  We check reports first, and that's the fastest way to get a bad post removed from public view.

But more to the point, I'm trying to understand the reaction that Cersei and Pycelle had to Tyrion being appointed Master of Coin. At first Cersei seems to balk at the idea, but then quickly makes a statement of support for the idea. Pycelle then backs that up, I'm assuming because he's Cersei's pet. 

But why is there such an out pouring of support for this appointment? Being that Cersei and Pycelle despise Tyrion to the fullest, this reaction kind of threw me off a bit. It would seem like they would want him as far away from the Small Council as possible. My only thought was that they're just posturing for the Hand, which seems kind of redundant given Tywin's personality (he doesn't seem very susceptible to flattery), or that he's going to fail miserably and make himself look like a total fool (which given Tyrion's nature could easily back fire on them).

Not because of obvious plot foreshadowing, nor even by fantastic speculation skills on my part, I just mean that in most fantasy stories there is a general formula of ""here are some good guys with awesome stories,  and here are some bad guys (sometimes they have a story, sometimes not).  hmm I wonder what's going to happen by the end. 

Game of Thrones has completely thrown that formula out the window. I read the story and find myself cheering for three different sides in the same war.  At the end of the day I know that at least two of my favourite characters, characters that I am rooting for with all my heart, are going to get destroyed.  So i sat down last night and tried to figure out exactly who I am rooting for, and who im rooting against.   Here is the result:

* Robb Stark - **Rooting For**
* Dany Targaryen - **Rooting For**
* Jaime and Tyrion Lannister -  **Rooting For**
* Stannis Baratheon - **Rooting For**
* Theon Greyjoy - **Rooting For**
* Jon Snow - **Rooting For**

* Tywin Lannister - **Rooting Against**
* Cersei and Joffery Lannister **Rooting Against**
* Melisandre - **Rooting Against**
* White Walkers - **Rooting Against** (lol this list was a little empty)

Im sure I could add more,  but I feel like I had made my point.  If you look at the list of characters I am rooting for, almost all of them want the rest of them dead.

Shit is going to hit the fan eventually and I just don't know what banner I will be flying. 

and that is why I **love** this story.

Continuing this weekly series, I'd like to invite all of you non-readers to stay awhile and learn something more about the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. This is supposed to be a TV series subreddit, isn't it? We readers believe that sharing our knowledge will enrich your experience.

^(By the way, sorry for forgetting to add spoiler tag, I read the mod announcement too late.)

**TL;DR: Stay a non-reader, but learn extra facts so you know almost as much as readers do! Not interested? Upvote for non-reader-friendly OC!**

As usual, the writers try to choose a title that can be related to more than one scenery. Aside of the actual place in Astapor, I think Edmure's failure and Jaime's captivity may be read that way.

This episode featured absoultely every single location but the Bran's field trip. In some cases I have nothing new to add because the show is closing chapters that I already covered in [the last followup](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1bxkbg/followup_for_nonreaders_dark_wings_dark_words/). I promise that the next week we'll have much more trivia to talk about.

**Riverrun: Cool Guys Don't Look At Immolations**

&gt; ""Even in war's darkest days, in most places of the world absolutely nothing is happening"" - Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully, proving that not all Tullys are incapable of doing or saying anything wise

* Meet the Tullys! Both Edmure and Blackfish have been portrayed perfectly so far. What you might have forgotten is that there is another Tully that should have appeared: Lysa Arryn (the creepy woman breastfeeding a 7 year old boy back in S01), who did not leave her safe Eyrie to show up at her father's funeral.

* Riverrun has been the location where most of events in A Clash of Kings (Season 2) concerning Catelyn took place. Catelyn has been beside his dying father the whole time, but the old man wasn't much responsive. Prior to his demise, he has mistaken Catelyn for Lysa and started talking as if she was there, recreating memories from years ago - more on that later.

* At this point we need to wrap up some trivia from the past. Characters from Riverrun have been pushed towards Season 3 to easy out the story (less new characters in Season 2, better distinction between seasons), but there are some major differences between the show and the books. First and foremost, Robb and Catelyn were split up for some time and in the books Robb is not a point-of-view (POV) character. To their knowledge Bran and Rickon are dead and the news of their murder is what drives both of them to stupid actions (freeing Jaime and breaking the marriage deal). The list goes as far as to the identity of Robb's wife.

* Edmure's misstep in the books was even more detrimental for Robert's cause: he rushed to attack Tywin himself while his army was marching west to attack Robb. Point is Robb *wanted* to lure Tywin west as he knew Stannis was about to siege King's Landing. By stopping Tywin, Edmure gave him time to hear the news and roll east to rescue the capital.

* A small paragraph to celebrate the armour of the Tullys. Good God this thing is outstanding.

* Have you realized that Robb no longer keeps Grey Wind (yeah, the big furry killing machine) around? He claims that the direwolf killed too many people in battle to be afraid of them, so he doesn't bring him indoors. Also the reason he brought up when Catelyn asked him is that his wife and her mother were afraid of Grey Wolf. In response he heard ""He's a part of you. Being afraid of him is being afraid of you"". Robb doesn't trust the direwolves, though, after they failed to protect his brothers.

* Hoster Tully's mumble sheds some light on Lysa's past. In his fever he comforts Lysa and says that she will have more children from the right bed. Catelyn realizes that her sister had been forced to abort a child before she married Jon Arryn and that her father forced lord of the Vale to marry a girl who lost her maidenhood as a price for his support in the rebellion.

* Back to the war scheme: don't even bother looking at the map and trying to make sense of what we've seen in the show. The writers have altered the events for the better viewer experience (so we don't get bombarded with new characters all at once), but at cost of some consistency.

**Tyrion's sitcom: Musical Chairs**

&gt; ""We're going to need details. Copious details"" - Tyrion Lannister, for the first time in the history of the show creating a situation of sexual context without actually showing it

* All those details, all those nuances, all those histories - and all you need to understand the situation is one hundred seconds of silence while people move two chairs around the table.

* Said scene with the council lasts throughout a whole chapter from Tyrion's POV and covers some material which may be yet to appear in the show. It concerned plans for Sansa and news about Robb's marriage (in the books he marries a daughter of one of the lesser lords sworn to Lannisters). Excessive amount of information got replaced with excessive amount of interaction.

* Tyrion instantly realizes that getting the lordship over Harrenhal to become highborn enough to marry Lysa Arryn was Littlefinger's plan all along. Littlefinger grew up with Catelyn and Lysa Tully, but couldn't marry any of them due to his low family status.

* Podrick Payne - yeah, it's the same family as Illyn Payne, the mute executioner who beheaded Ned Stark! Small world.

* ""Meereenese knot"" is a term that GRRM used to describe one of his biggest writing deadlocks. That was a nod to the readers.

**Brienne &amp; Jaime: The Journey That's Getting Off Hand**

&gt; ""He would be a cripple, a grotesque; give me a good, clean death any day"" - Jaime Lannister, back in Season 1 about Bran

* Okay, this looks like the point where we wrap up the differences that had built up over a longer time. Instead of Locke, the Bolton man, we had a whole group of individuals called the Brave Companions (or, behind their back, Bloody Mummers). The group of sellswords had a considerably ill reputation, as it consisted of criminals and outcasts from overseas. And by ""individuals"", I mean ""psychos"" (list involves paedophile killer priest, crazy jester, wannabe-necromancer and the two lads from the cage that was heading to the Wall in S02).

* If you look back to my [previous followup](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1bxkbg/followup_for_nonreaders_dark_wings_dark_words/), I mentioned that there was a song that lady Olenna Tyrell ordered to be performed to cover up her conversation with Sansa. That was the song. We are going to hear it again, probably, as episode 7 has its title.

* Tarth is truly called the Sapphire Island. [from Jaime's POV it's instantly known, but the show might come back to this](#b ""Not necessarily due to anything related to mining gemstones"").

**Brotherhood Without Banners** - this week, here goes nothing! Say goodbye to Hot Pie :( In two weeks, though...

**Wildlings and Crows: Admiring the Crop Field Marks**

&gt; ""Always the artists"" - Mance Rayder, keeping cool even in the face of (un)death

* This scene suggests that the White Walkers need men, not horses. We've seen a White Walker riding an undead horse, so it appears that the Wights can't ride. By the way, the first chapter of ASOS involves an undead bear. Yeah, you heard that one right.

* Remember Gilly? The girl Sam talked to in Season 2? That was her.

**Theon Greyjoy** - Once again: a book reader has no single idea about what happened to Theon Greyjoy after the sack of Winterfell. The story gets revealed in the book 5 (A Dance With Dragons, so the newest one!). If you're planning on reading the books, do it now and do it fast.

**Dragonstone** - There is a running joke in the comments today that there have been three rapes in the episode: one on Theon, one on Brienne, and the third one was performed by the writers on Stannis.

**Daenerys: Harpy's Nest**

&gt; ""Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. *And Rhaegar died.* - Jorah Mormont

* Who's this Rhaegar fellow, you ask? He was the Mad King's firstborn son. Older brother to Viserys and Daenerys. The day he disappeared with Lyanna Stark marked the beginning of the Robert's rebellion. Robert Baratheon fought Rhaegar at the Trident and killed him. Baratheon-Lannister forces sacked the King's Landing after that.

* Fellow book readers, what the hell did those kids lurking around the arena mean? I get the metaphore of Dany giving up one of her children, but this was kinda troubling.

* People already wanted to buy her dragons back in Qarth. The lines were along ""give me one third of all the ships in the world, and I'll give you one third of all the dragons in the world"". Needless to say, the merchants of Qarth did not own that many ships.

First of all, Theon. Ramsay is supposed to have him in a dungeon long enough to take  half of his digits, break his teeth, and almost make him forget his own name. Instead, he's in Ramsay's custody for all of 1 day, and all he gets is a screw in the foot.

Secondly, Jaime's hand. It's supposed to get chopped off in Harrenhall, by a character that has a history of mutilating his prisoners. The way it was done in the show it felt like an afterthought. It wasn't the right guy, and Qyburn wasn't there to save his life. I find it hard to believe that anybody in the group that captured Jaime and Brienne has the medical knowledge to stop Jaime from bleeding out.

Thirdly, where's Beric Dondarrion? The actor they have playing Thoros looks more like Beric from the descriptions in the books, and we haven't seen him since season 1.

Just wondering what your opinions were on that, or if I'm mistaken and it's the same as the book.
I really liked Theon's story in the book and was hoping they'd stick to it.

I don't mind that they changed the severity of Tyrion's disfigurement, as that wasn't so important, but I hope they don't go changing too much from the books, although it's understandable they have to adapt to the limited time compared to books.

A few notes. The 20 characters with the most screentime/important stuff happening to them get points for that week. That is all. Without further ado....

Daenerys Targaryen +8 (Season Total: +11)
Yeah yeah, she gave up a precious dragon. But she also gained an army and proved herself as a shrewd negotiator who gets what she wants. Westeros or bust!

Podrick Payne +6 (Season Total: +6)
Awwwwww yeah

Tyrion Lannister +4 (Season Total: +1)
Master of Coin isn't the most prestigious position in the realm, but hey, it is still a promotion. 

Mysterious Kid With Bow And Arrow aka Little Bastard +3 (Season Total: +3)
I haven't read the books so I don't know who the fuck you are or why you are helping Theon, but good for you.

Blackfish Tully +3 (Season Total: +3)
Probably the most badass new character yet. 

Mance Rayder +3 (Season Total: +11)
Planning an attack on Castle Black? Here is to making a move.

Brienne of Tarth +2 (Season Total: +3)
Way to defend your honor lady. Brienne don't take no stuff.

Robb Stark +1 (Season Total -9)
Nice job putting your uncle in place. Now if you weren't strategically fucked.

Arya Stark +1 (Season Total: +6)
Not sure if she is a hostage or a recruit, but she seems to be at least moderately safe rolling with the Brotherhood. 

Theon Greyjoy: +1 (Season Total: -9)
Plus one for not getting raped in the ass. Close one.

Samwell Tarly: -1 (Season Total: -10)
Always getting picked on. Poor guy.

Jorah Mormont: -1 (Season Total: -2)
You let Daenerys trade away a dragon? WTF?

Barristan Selmy: -1 (Season Total: 0)
You let Daenerys trade away a dragon? WTF?

Jon Snow: -2 (Season Total: +2)
Looks like you are in a tight spot. Hope you don't get thrown off a cliff.

The Hound -3: (Season Total: -3)
Hooded and imprisoned. Things aren't looking good for you man.

Craster: -3 (Season Total: -3)
Just because you creep me the fuck out.

Edmure Tully: -4 (Season Total: -4)
Between fucking up the funeral and getting his ass chewed out by Robb, not a good week for Edmure.

Stannis Baretheon: -4 (Season Total: -12)
Don't get your panties in a bunch dude just because your lady has to leave to get some blood because you are too weak and stuff. Just fucking chill already.

Cat Stark: -5 (Season Total: -10)
Continuing to fall into a deeper pit of despair. 

Jaime Lannister: -7 (Season Total: -2)
Yep. That just happened.

The clan has said they are from the North, but also said something along the line of Lady Catelyn is a traditious cunt, or along those lines.  I remember when Lady Catelyn free'd Jaime from his imprisonment, Rob Stark sent a group out to search for him.  When the group encountered Brienne and Jaime fighting on the bridge at the end of episode two, I assumed it was the group Rob Stark had sent looking for Jaime.  But I was wrong.  My searches has led me to find that this group is [House Bolton of the Dreadfort](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Bolton), but this entry told me little about the clan.  With them being from the North, I would assume they would have comradery with the Stark's and Winterfell, but based on the last two eposides, I have found my assumptions to be incorrect.  Obviously they don't give a shit about Brienne, or they would have had their way with her if Jaime hadn't intervened.  And they obviously don't give a shit about Jaime, otherwise [](#s ""they wouldn't have cut his fucking hand off"").

Can someone give me some information on who the House Bolton of the Dreadfort are, what their goals and intentions are, and more importantly, what they want with Brienne and Jaime? And if they are part of the North, why are they not allies with the Stark's and Winterfell?

I just finished the wedding.

I listen to the audio books, and I was happily listening to Arya on her way home, finally! Although I was expecting some kind of upset considering she was promised to the Frays, I wasn't expecting this. Catlyne is thinking about how this is the worst wedding of all time, and then she noticed something funny.. And then Catelyn ran after someone to investigate, and then felt a burning sensation in her back.. And then the musicians were not musicians.. And then Rob had a sword twisting through his heart.. And then Catelyn was tearing off the head of Jinglebells, and ripping her own face apart... And it was over..

And to make matters worse, the next fucking chapter!!

The axe was embedded into her skull... Are you fucking kidding me?!? I am feeling so many emotions. This is by far the most dramatic experience I've ever had in a book. I am horrified, disgusted, sad, and anxious... 

G.R.R.M is a goddamn genius.. And I both love and hate him for this.

That is all, thank you for listening...

Let us COMPARE them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1cgxyt/spartacus_is_godly_got_is_fantastic_both_have/,RAA,1366130905,"Yes, its true, one can like two shows simultaneously and find values with them. I know that Spartacus had 3.5 spectacular seasons and then ended on an upswing, solidifying it in glory. Game of Thrones continues to blossom and develop before our eyes, so is harder to pinpoint, but they can already be discussed. 

This thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/1ca7d1/i_think_i_enjoyed_spartacus_more_than_im_enjoying/) provides the inspiration for the discussion, snagged from the Spartacus_TV subreddit. 

---

**Narrative focus**

Spartacus is a much more *focused, cohesively storyline*, which allows a viewer to delve deep into the plot and relationships of a large handful of characters. As a viewer this makes it easier to become emotionally invested when there are more intense focusing on just a few pivotal characters.

Game of Thrones provides *many different characters and interweaves the storylines*, giving more complexity to the entire world and universe. As a viewer this provides for lush background and motivation behind actions, and asks the viewer to tax his/her working memory in attempt to fit all pieces together. 

---


**Action and combat, T&amp;A, immersion**


Spartacus has combat *central to the narrative and world-rules, displaying it vividly on screen and in abundant amounts*. Much conflict in the world is resolved via violence, with roughly 50/50 solutions deriving from politics/violence. There are *ample sex scenes and much nudity* (considerably more than GoT), which is more reminiscent of the time period of Rome and objectifying people as slaves. This time-period also lends itself to a particularly enticing linguistic style of dialogue, with a focus on references to Gods, vulgarity, and metaphorical meanings.

  
Game of Thrones presents much conflict and development of narrative through discussion and politics, with violence appearing sparingly, but to great effect. *Much of the action takes place off-screen or as a result of decisive maneuvering*, which makes the on-screen combat/action impactful in its brevity. There *are plenty of sex scenes*, but the time period grants less immersive gratuitousness as part of the environment. This time period commands fantasy and allows for extravagant solutions/conflicts through plot-devices less commonly utilized. 

---

**Difficulties in creating the show**


Spartacus *follows a set history, giving it less creative liberties, yet still allows it to fill in the gaps*. This makes it impactful as were seeing representations of historical figures in very crazy situations. It also suffered the *death* of its protagonist Actor, Andy Whitfield, and *spiraled it into disarray, which it crawled out of gracefully, despite a low budget*.

 
Game of Thrones has *no authenticity to worry about outside its own creative source material*, which makes *GoT an adaptation*. It must follow the rules of the books, which is a hefty challenge in itself, and be compared to a source material that no film/tv could compare to, given the difference in form. Despite these difficulties, *GoTs massive following provides it with abundant resources and budget, giving it plentiful capability*. 


---


**TL;DR**

*The two can rightfully be compared as some of the most grippingly complex television this decade for the fans of swords and bosoms, and magnificent dialogue*. Spartacus has concluded its run-time with one of the best finales Ive seen in a show, perhaps. Each episode of the series was progressive, story-wise, with nary a moment wasted. It also presented something appealing to the senses in the form of cinematography, beautiful bodies, quotable dialogue, stunning combat choreography, with unpredictable twists and perplexing behavior weaving the epic tale into one emotional joyride not soon forgotten. It improved with every season until stunning climax, wrapping up all loose ends. 


Game of Thrones has already proven itself worthy in many ways, and remains a fan favorite for a reason. It has a very challenging task of converting the lengthy, dense literature into a digestible television format, and appears to be excelling at goal with head held high. I hope to see its continued improvement as a series until stunning finale.

[Here's a link to the song in question, track 17 on the Season 2 Soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frgjD_5YHwc)

  
I'm a big fan of Ramin Djawadi's score for Game of Thrones - [I posted this write up a bit over a week ago on the different themes and motifs in the Game of Thrones music](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bulzc/musical_themes_and_motifs_in_ramin_djawadis_score/)


But sometimes, there's a melody or a motif in the show/soundtracks and I just can't work out what it represents, where it fits in.


Some clever commenters identified a theme I couldn't work out, which was fantastic (the Rains of Castamere vocal melody motif)


Well this track I've linked to, **""The Old Gods and The New""**, is a lovely track. But I just can't work out what it represents. I'm sure I've heard  the motif in the show before but I can't find where.


The only scene I can find with it playing is [Brienne pledging to Catelyn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El4WE5PAFGs). 

I think it sounds a *bit* like the [Stark theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oth_nFcbK-Y#t=40s), but not enough to be counted as a variation of it.


What does everybody think? What's your opinion on this track? **Do you know any other scenes or OST tracks where the same motif appears?**

What I like most is the injustice in the show. How not everything has a satisfactory ending, how not everything is justified, and sometimes the villains win. Some episodes a character is victorious in what they do, and their victory is so thorough and flawless it gives you the goosebumps and makes you all happy that they succeeded, only to have the character very quickly discredited for everything they have done and fills you with rage at the injustice. It makes me much more emotionally invested in everything.

**Possible spoiler** Most notably when [AGOT](#b ""Ned gets beheaded""), I'm certain most people felt a major sense of injustice which will last throughout the seasons. My favorite character being Tyrion (Maybe that's *supposed* to be the favorite character), I had emotional investment built strongly when he [AGOT](#b ""gets no credit for such a flawless victory in battle where he was not only the underdog, but where he was also redeemed for the shame of being accidentally knocked out before the previous battle."")",3,11,False,self,,,,,

- Episode 1, Show Cersei mentions the fact that she'd heard Tyrion had lost his nose in battle.  Why dropped from the show, it was a clear reference to the reality that that's exactly what happened in the book.

- Episode 2, this one is one show only fans could pick up on as well... And an area where the show outdoes the books... Gendry calling Ayra out on the names she gave Jaqen.. Never addressed in the books on why Ayra wasted her picks... An excellent bit of fan service. 

- Episode 3, the ""Mereeneese Knot"".  While a vague reference to what seems a unique sex position in show.  This term to book readers refers to Dany's current (as of where bookreaders are) storyline in Mereen, and some fan frustrations with that plotline. I won't go into further detail outside a spoiler tag, but the reference in show made me chuckle.

Why break away from this industry standard?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1chfub/why_does_got_not_include_a_previously_on_recap/,RAA,1366143938,"So, this may or may not be accurate, depending on method of watching the show, but in my experience, there is NO prior episode recap before an episode starts. I've discussed this with 4 different people and they also noticed its absence. Perhaps it appears in some formats or not, but why is it absent at all? 

**Why a recap is important for a show**

It's important for any show that appears on a weekly basis to recap the prior episodes to jog and re-ignite the memory of the viewers. In any show that's running for 10+ hours, the ability to house all of the information in memory is certainly there, *but what the recap does is PRIME you for the events to come.*

It's not just a recap of last episode, but a recap grabbing info and scenes from multiple episodes pertaining to what one will see in this episode. **This priming of your memory allows you to take in information while watching the new episode and process it IN THE MOMENT, as opposed to retroactively**. 

*Game of Thrones, as such, appears a much more grievous culprit due to the fact that it very obviously relies on interweaving complex storylines together.* It may have more storylines and parallel plotting than any show I've seen. It's incredibly taxing on working memory to attempt to process all the new information one is seeing while also trying to recall prior information without any form of recap.

So then I ask, why? What is the purpose of leaving out this industry standard? Apart from truly challenging the audience, I see little benefit to such a decision. ",8,0,False,self,,,,,

The short version goes like this:

* Ackerman misses out that Robb was acclaimed King of the Riverlands as well as the North, which changes his strategic objectives and his options dramatically.

* Robb's decision to make Tywin choose between protecting Casterly Rock or King's Landing was a smart one that (mostly) paid off, grounded in the realities of feudal politics that Ackerman doesn't take into account.

* Even in the show, which badly botches its explanation of what's going on here, Robb's strategy to draw out the Mountain and destroy his army is a good one. ",3,5,False,self,,,,,

I have been dying to talk to my friends who only watch the show about some upcoming characters in the series not yet seen in the TV show, so I've created a list of who I believe to be the most exciting of these characters that appear later on in the series.  I've also added brief descriptions of each and have been very careful about what I say about them, so there should only be backstory regarding these names and very minor teasers concerning their purpose in the story.  If I do, unfortunately, still manage to spoil something for someone please let me know, I'll edit it out immediately and I greatly apologize if this happens to be a case.  So counting down from number 12, here is who I believe to be the best of what's to come in HBO's Game of Thrones!

12.  Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor.  The immensely fat head of House Manderly and the Lord of White Harbor, this man is a very loyal ally to House Stark and The North.  He was unable to join Robb Stark and the northern armies in war due to his weight and health, but still remains an important figure in the northern cause.  His unpredictable behavior and outlandish humor has caused him to become a fan favorite amongst readers.

11.  Areo Hotah, ""The Watcher.""  Captain of Doran Martell's household guard.  A highly skilled and observant warrior, one of the best in the world.

10.  Ser Gerold Dayne, ""Darkstar.""  Cousin to the legendary ""Sword of the Morning"" Ser Arthur Dayne.  A fearless and extremely cocky young knight who does what he wants despite the consequences and may be hiding a few secrets about the mysterious House Dayne of Starfall.

9.  Arch Maester Marwyn, ""Marwyn the Mage.""  Arch Maester of The Citadel in Oldtown, the academy for Westeros' guild of intellectual scholars.  One of the very few maesters that practice and study magic, which is normally frowned upon by his society.  Educated Mirri Maz Durr, the murderer of Khal Drogo and his son Rhaego, in black magic.  Has been thinking about traveling to Essos to become Daenerys Targaryen's advisor and historian.

8.  Arianne Martell, Princess of Dorne.  Doran Martell's eldest child and heir to Sunspear by Dornish Law.  Advisor and role model to Princess Myrcella, King Joffery's little sister, and bound to be an exciting new player in the game of thrones.

7.  Doran Nymeros Martell, Lord of Sunspear and Prince of Dorne.  Current ruler of the Kingdom of Dorne and older brother to Queen Elia Martell, the late wife of the also deceased Rhaegar Targaryen.  A very patient and carefully calculated player in the game of thrones with a few game changers hidden up his sleeve.

6.  Quentyn Martell, Prince of Dorne.  Doran Martell's eldest son and next in line for heritage of Sunspear after older sister Arianne Martell.  Currently serving as a squire in the neighboring Yronwood on the verge of embarking on what is to be an incredible adventure with a purpose so important that it can only be revealed by reading the later books.

5.  Victarion Greyjoy, ""The Iron Captain.""  Theon's uncle and younger brother of Balon and Euron Greyjoy.  Commander of The Iron Fleet, a collective of warships loyal to House Greyjoy with numbers in the hundreds, and captain of his own ship The Iron Victory.  A vicious brute of a warrior who's strength and viciousness in battle exceed his wits and intellect.  A man who is incredibly loyal to his brother Balon while being the opposite towards his other brother Euron, whom he looks upon with extreme hatred and disgust.

4.  ""Griff"" and ""Young Griff.""  Two sellswords in service of Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos, who is a loyal ally to Daenerys Targaryen.  Their true identities, as well as their overall purpose, are to important to be revealed at this current time.

3.  ""The Three Eyed Crow.""  The mysterious figure that has been speaking to Bran Stark through his dreams since the very beginning.  The man behind it all's true identity will finally be revealed in due time.

2.  Euron Greyjoy, ""Crow's Eye.""  Theon's uncle and Balon's next eldest brother.  Captain of The Silence and currently exiled from The Iron Islands.  A mysterious pirate who is both a deadly warrior and a remarkably intelligent player in the game of thrones.  He is hiding several incredible secrets about his nature, journeys, and overall intentions, a man who claims to be enlightened due to regular consumption of ""shade of the evening,"" the intriguing blue elixar held sacred by warlocks such as Pyat Pree of Qarth.

1.  Oberyn Nymeros Martell, ""The Red Viper.""  Doran Martell's younger brother and a Prince of Dorne.  A deadly warrior known all throughout the world for his habit of poisoning his enemies.  Like his brother, Oberyn is a cunning player of the game of thrones but only with less patience and more unpredictability and recklessness.  Briefly served with the sellsword company The Second Sons in Essos and forged several links on his maester's chain before leaving The Citadel due to boredom.  A man of the upmost vicious nature dead set on seeking revenge for the murder of his beloved sister Queen Elia Martell, the wife of Rhaegar Targaryen who was murdered along with her children during the Sack of King's Landing at the conclusion of Robert Baratheon's Rebellion.  

Others of note:

-Nymeria Sand and Obara Sand, ""Lady Nym.""  Two of Oberyn Martell's ""Sand Snakes,"" the name given to the several bastard daughters of The Red Viper, Nymeria is a beautiful but equally dangerous young woman of the upmost loyalty to House Martell, while Obara is the oldest of the sisters and also the most talented warrior among them.  What makes Nymeria an especially dangerous player in the game of thrones is her tendency to follow very closely in the controversial footsteps of her father, while Obara's importance to the story lies within a certain mission given to her by Doran Martell that cannot yet be revealed to someone who hasn't read the books.

-Aurane Waters, ""The Bastard of Driftmark.""  Though not included in the show's second season, Aurane Waters played an important role in the Battle of the Blackwater while serving under Stannis Baratheon.  A talented captain, Waters earns the trust of Cersei Lannister and becomes her Master of Ships.  Aurane's role develops into a greater importance later in the series, so much so that his inclusion in the later seasons seems inevitable. 

-Ser Arys Oakheart and Ser Balon Swann.  Two of the seven highly-skilled knights that form the Kingsguard, these two members in particular come to hold some significance of their own.  Oakheart travels with Princess Myrcella to Dorne as her guardian and protector, while Swann later embarks on an important mission of his own regarding the investigation of a certain event that occurs later on in the series.

-Mace Tyrell, Willas Tyrell and Ser Garlan Tyrell.  The father and older brothers of ""The Knight of Flowers"" Loras Tyrell and Queen Margaery Tyrell, all three of these characters take on interesting roles in the series that will hopefully be adapted in the show.  Mace is the current lord of the powerful Highgarden, who has heavy influence over the politics of King's Landing despite being described by his mother ""The Queen of Thorns"" as a dumb oaf.  Meanwhile, Willas is the eldest son of Lord Mace Tyrell and the heir to Highgarden.  He is a former knight who suffered a leg injury that crippled him at the hands of Oberyn Martell while jousting against him during a tourney, a man of high intellect who has replaced his chivalrous ways of old with books and scholarly interests.  Outside of a few brief mentions, Willas is physically absent from all perspectives followed by the books due to his duty to stay behind in the yet unseen Highgarden.  Lastly, Ser Garlan Tyrell is a profound knight much like his brother Loras, who is even described by Loras himself as ""the better swordsman of the two"" (though Loras remains the better jouster).  While all the Tyrells present in King's Landing are portrayed as sneaky players in the game of thrones, Ser Garlan appears to refrain from politics in order to further train and better himself as a knight.  He is regarded highly by fans due to his very kind and friendly treatment of Tyrion Lannister.

-Aeron Greyjoy, ""The Damphair.""  The third and final living uncle of Theon's and the youngest brother of Balon Greyjoy, Aeron is a loyal priest of The Drowned God and briefly appeared in the show's second season when he was most likely the one who baptised Theon back on Pyke.  He regards his religion with the highest importance, which causes him to greatly loathe all those who oppose The Drowned God, most notably his ""godless"" older brother, Euron Greyjoy.

Ser Kevan Lannister.  Though already briefly appearing in the show, he may have been overlooked and already forgotten by many show-watchers, Kevan is the younger brother of the mighty Tywin Lannister, and he develops into a more prominent role later in the series.

Brown Ben Plumm and The Tattered Prince.  These two characters are both head of command of two separate sellsword companies in Essos, The Second Sons and The Windblown.  Both bands of sellswords come into high importance later on in the series amongst the ongoing adventures of everybody's favorite Khaleesi, Daenerys Targaryen.

Pate, ""The Pig Boy"" and Alleras.   Two young apprentices at The Citadel, the university that educates the future maesters of Westeros, Pate ends up getting himself caught up with a very familiar face that both readers as well as show-watchers will be able to recognize if they pay very close attention, a familiar face who has recently turned his attention onto something that is as mysterious as the character himself.  Meanwhile, Alleras is another very mysterious figure that comes into the story by befriending a certain character that later travels to The Citadel to become a maester himself.

I remember bringing up the idea years ago that the Whitebeard reveal would inevitably be ruined for TV viewers as one of the great things 'lost in translation', which was frustrating to me because I especially loved that relatively minor plot twist. It kept me feeling as if I needed to pay attention to everything, nothing is as it seems, and reminded me that characters in this world don't just disappear -- each and every person has their own lives, they are not merely plot devices. 

Unfortunately that slow-played reveal just wasn't possible to convert to film. Fotrunately, the one thing film is best at is giving life to visuals which can make as much or more of an impact than even readers' imaginations. So I began daydreaming at work to think of the scenes I expect us insatiable readers will find even more thrilling on TV than they remembered the books being (and of course feel free to add your own).

* While still one of my favorite scenes in the books (mostly because it finally got the wheels turning in Dany's arc), I'm *very* excited for this Sunday's episode and the army stealing, face-melting chaos about to be wreaked. GRRM's visuals were great, but this has the potential to be a massively epic scene on screen. 

* Another Dany scene which didn't really resonate well for me on the page but which I think will be historical for the series  -- if the show is still on air 4 or 5 years from now -- is the Drogon gladiator arena scene. It seems like it would be a dream scene for people that enjoy action/sfx; massive black dragon descends into a crowded arena, unleashes fire &amp; death everywhere, gets in a fight with mommy, then flies off with her? Epic TV written all over that scene .... but unfortunately that is literally a half decade away from happening.

* The war at the wall! I mean, c'mon! This is like a Michael Bay wet dream of an action scene, except good. I also expect the realities of filming this battle will be much less taxing on the budgets &amp; logistics than the Battle of Blackwater was which included a whole naval element which isn't easy to film. Also think Dave &amp; Dan have earned HBO's respect enough to ask for a few more gold dragons to make the sequence bigger.

* Tyrion and the crossbow. Such an awesome ending to book 3 ... but with Dinklage and Charles Dance playing out that scene, two of the finest actors in the entire series? The facial expressions alone are going to make this scene even better than the text, of that I have no doubt. I personally believe Charles Dance belongs in the same conversation as Dinklage and Jack Gleeson of amazingly perfect character portrayals. 

* Speaking of Dinklage, the end of book 3, and facial expressions ... Tyrion and Shae ... oh man! 

* Every scene with Tyrion and Penny (they better not cut Penny out of the show damnit!)

(Spoilers Inside),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1cjs0c/is_joffrey_gay_spoilers_inside/,[deleted],1366223497,"In S03E03 when Joffrey confronts Margaery about her dead husband Renly Baratheron, Joffrey says some very homphobic things about the late Lord Baratheron, even suggesting that homosexuality should be punishable by death.  As I watched the scene I started to notice Joffrey squirming and being very uncomfortable as he slowly began to disparage the homosexual lifestyle.  His fervent condemnation of homosexuals parallels many modern politicians that have been caught doing much the same only to be revealed as closet homosexuals.   I also thought back to the past episodes and realized that I've never once seen Joffrey actual lust after a woman, and his only sexual encounter (if you can call it that) was when he had Ros beat Daisy.  

Not having read the novels, I wonder if Joffrey is a closet homosexual?  So much of his behavior would seem fitting of someone that is trying to play the part of a sadistic king, fulfilling the expectations that would normally be placed upon the king of Westeros, while suppressing his true feelings.  

Is there any merit to this idea or am I reading too much into things?",0,1,False,default,,,,,

&gt; It's tiny scenes like this where I wish the show would give us a few more Blackwater-style episodes per season. One that was, say, all Jon Snow. And then another for Arya or Dany. **I know episode nine of this year, like last season, will follow the same Blackwater ""one location, one event"" story**, but I could stand for another one.

I may have simply missed something, but I thought I was pretty up-to-date with everything regarding season 3 and this is news to me. It could also be a mistake by whoever wrote the article.

Obviously the main event of the episode can't really be done in a 15 minute segment, so it makes sense that a large portion of the episode will be devoted to it, but a whole episode? It seems plausible enough, but at the same time I can't imagine it being stretched out to 55 minutes or so. It's been a year since I read the books though so perhaps more happens around this event than I remembered. I suppose you have stuff with Arya and the Hound going on as well.

If I recall it correctly they mentioned that this Rhaegar person had Dragon**s**.

So how did he lose to some guys with bows and arrows on horses?

And where the hell did those dragons go to anyway? Did they just decide to retire after they lost the war? - I mean there must have been a lot of them right?


Sorry if I got some names wrong, or this is just clear as daylight to everyone here, but I am kind of a stupid person and I have only seen the TV show so far, but whenever they mention dragon related things or talk about how strong the would be / have been / etc. ... these two questions come to my mind.

Everyone seems super fond of the scene (I haven't finished the second book yet), and while I liked the scene, I thought that was an incredibly stupid move of them.

Why? They might not know that Sansa's overtrusting nature led to her father's death, but we do. And I'm assuming they were able to tell how gullible she is by how they appealed to her and by how fast she trusted them. But they don't seem to take any precautions against or consider that Sansa might reveal to the their attitudes to the Lannisters. The general consensus seems to be that the Queen of Thrones is brilliant politically, so... why was that not thought of?

I'll be fast, because the internet is a busy place.

I'm Clements. I used to review video games at IGN for years (I never took a bribe, I promise!). My position got cut a few months ago, and I had time to finish some personal projects.

I always wanted to write fiction. I'm not great, but I truly love writing. I just finished my first short story, and thought some of you might dig it. You can find it on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Ferius-Foxfur-Bottle-Violet-ebook/dp/B00CEP7494/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366339138&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ferius) or get more information on my [website](http://www.storyoferas.com) .

Don't buy it if you're low on cash. Read the free summary and see what you think. Love it or hate it, it's all good -- I'm an easy-going guy. But I'm also an internet junkie, and I just wanted to share it with fellow children of the web. My work is just my way of honoring the brilliant writers, filmmakers, and game designers that came before me.

Word. Thanks for your time!",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I've lost 18 of the past 48 hours watching episode after episode of this fantastic production and I'd like to share my thoughts.

Now, I hate King Joffrey as much as the next guy, but I feel that the show has vindicated this by showing his city attack him and the Lannisters losing most battles. I feel that Joffrey will get what he deserves. Theon Greyjoy on the other hand. Now there is a real despicable cunt. The last thing I have seen regarding stopping him is Robb sending a small force to retake Winterfell. I don't have confidence that they will succeed, which pains me after seeing what that piece of shit did to Bran and his walnut eating brother. Seeing that made my heart melt and drain through my ribs and organs, tears were shed.

In regards to Starks vs. Lannisters, I hope that Robb gets what he deserves, but I really wish he has put more effort to defending North whilst he was away. Now in regards to the Lannisters, Tyrion is one of the greatest characters I have ever seen in the history of television. Despite his knack for escaping death, I believe that his honour is on par with that of Eddard Stark's himself. It's nice to see that someone with some sense has a fair position of power in King's Landing. I hope Tywin doesn't fulfil his full role as hand for a while yet. I honestly don't know why Jaime's head remains on his shoulders and not sent to the feet of the King Joffrey himself. I hated Cersei at first, but that changed when I saw try to prevent Eddard's execution. She may a lying, incestuous and deceptive bitch, but she has got a shred of honour and feeling towards poor Sansa.

My mindset regarding Stannis Baratheon was ""He can have his throne, just let Robb remain King of the North and I won't really care."" But there is another factor that has come into play fairly recently and his greatly altered this mindset. Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons. She is the rightful heir and I believe that she deserves the throne and will be loved and love upon it. Jorah Mormont is currently my favourite character. He has a great of essence of being an anti hero as well as a watchful guardian over the queen and I adopted this mindset way back when there was that awesome scene where he prevented the wine merchant from poisoning her.

I'm aware that I've missed some things and I'd love to write more, but I'm going to go back to watching the show now, thank you for your attention (if this gets any).

P.S. Jon Snow is a FUCKING BADASS, I will always respect him for helping to keep the threats of the North at bay, but he is no hero. He is only doing his duty and only until recently he has not been able to do it alone.",43,33,False,default,,,,,

The show simplified it, never including the part about Drogo tearing off any sort of bandage. I'm not denying that Mirri Maz Duur knew what she was doing to him and Rhaego when Dany instructed her to use her blood magic, but I keep wondering: if Drogo kept the poultice on, would he have survived?

PLEASE LEAVE THE HOUSE BANNER YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW!

SINCE some people are accusing me of being a ""karma whore"" for ""reposting"" changed, new and different content in these updates I have decided to make this a text post, to try to convince these people that this is NOT in fact an attempt at karma and simply an attempt to share my work and to allow the people who have been interested in seeing more of it to actually see more of it.

Here is the updated album: http://imgur.com/a/pp5e8

I have updated some sigils and added some new banners, but something I'm quite happy about is the completion of the poster.  To be completely honest it's been sitting (hiding) in the background because I didn't know what I wanted to do with it until suddenly it hit me, the result is in the same album as the House banners.

Feedback is ALWAYS appreciated (seriously) I want to know what you guys things, what you think should be changed and what should NOT be changed etc. etc.

I am still taking banner requests, I'm stumped as what banners to do next (there are SO many Houses and factions/groups/organizations) and I find it hard to select the next one so I'm letting you guys tell me which houses or organizations you'd like to see in the next update (I will also message them to you for your feedback).

Thanks for looking/giving your feedback it is invaluable (truly).

Have a nice weekend.

For around a thousand years they haven't been a serious threat.

So why are they a threat now?

I'm entertaining the theory that Craster has greatly contributed to the more recent rise of the White Walkers (Others), and in turn the coming of winter. While we don't know how long Craster has been sacrificing his male children to the White Walkers, judging by the age of his wives/daughters, it can be hypothesized that he's been sacrificing males for the last twenty years or so, with the sacrifices occurring more frequently at an exponential pace (more daughter/wives = more possible male children) .

In short, has Craster's ""contribution"" led the rise of the White Walkers? Does this make him the underlying cause of the explosion of Wights (zombies) and the main reason that the wildlings are finding it increasingly difficult to live beyond the wall.

Whether the babies are being eaten by White Walkers or converted into new White Walkers, it seems highly likely that Craster may be single-handedly making life shitty for everyone but himself.",14,5,False,self,,,,,

I want to watch on a big screen, the 50 inch TV in my living room (It's not a smart TV Samsung), and on [this page](http://hbonordic.com/how-to-watch-hbo) it basically lists all the ways of watching HBO Nordic. It says it makes HBO available as a linear channel for all TVs that aren't Samsung smart TVs. I also don't have a laptop, and I don't feel like dragging my desktop PC all the way to the living room.

 Under ""Linear TV"" it says ""More information will follow."". Does this mean that it isn't implemented yet, or does it mean it's up? I don't completely understand how the linear channel works  and how it magically appears on my TV either. Another thing is that I don't know how long of a delay there is between when the episode airs in the US and when it gets put up on the linear channel. 

I could just record the episode if it airs in the middle of the night, so it wouldn't be a big deal if TV HBO is linear and not on-demand.

Are there any Norwegian, Swedish, Danish or Finnish people that are subscribed to HBO Nordic here? Maybe you can help me with this.  ",10,12,False,self,,,,,

So far this season, the character that I've seen benefit the most from these types of scenes is Catelyn. She's a complicated character, and many find her unsympathetic. I think the writers have realized this and are working to make her as sympathetic as possible before the Red Wedding. 

Who are some other characters that you feel would benefit greatly from additional scenes this season?

My vote is for Robb. A lot has been changed about the circumstances of his character, and many are finding him to have turned into a bit of a jackass (particularly in regards to his treatment of Cat over releasing Jaime, which is changed from the book, and the whole ordeal about his marriage). What I'd really like to see is him praying before a weirwood after Rickard Karstark's execution. This would really help to remind viewers that he's his father's son and show just how troubled he is. A discussion with Catelyn about how aware he is that he's made a royal mess of things by marrying Talisa would be nice too. Confiding in Cat about how he's losing bannermen left and right and doesn't know what do anymore would really humanize him. All we're seeing right now is stoic King Robb. We need to see some more of the teenage boy who's been thrust into leadership. ",13,12,False,self,,,,,

The way she just got strung up like any other soldier or bandit did not justify her story line. She deserved to go out fighting and at least find some form of vindication (finding Sansa/avenging Renly/finding true love). It would be as if Tyrion died from getting an STI from a whore or if Dany died from sun stroke.

I was totally shocked at the Red Wedding in ASOS as I didn't expect two important characters to go just like that but, although I don't trust GRRM to keep my favourite characters alive, I really thought Brienne as a character had a lot further to go in ASOIAF. She was a very human, three-dimensional character and not as stereotypical as characters like Robb or Joffery.

To be honest when Lady Stoneheart was giving her the choice of killing Jamie or giving her own life I was almost screaming at Brienne to just take up the sword and pretend to go kill Jamie. She was so close to picking up the trail of Sansa or even stumbling upon Arya's path by mistake.

Also, just interested as to what the word she shouted at her death was. I'm assuming it is not revealed in ADWD so GRRM wants us to make up our own minds. All I can think of is ""Jamie"" or ""Renly"", but again I don't think that does Brienne justice.

I'm just hoping GRRM can redeem himself in ADWD as he has a lot of making up to do for the way he just tossed Brienne out into the trash. (But of course, when I pick up ADWD I will love every chapter as I have done so far regardless!)

This is a link to a quick (10 question) survey I made, and I would really appreciate your responses!
[awesome survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PRGML6P)

This paper is very broad, so any comments you have on the fandom of the series would be appreciated.

When we left him, he was armed only with a broken wooden sword and standing opposite Meryn Trant, fully armed and armored. And that's the last we see or hear of him. At all. 

That's what I find most interesting. Joffrey was happy to offer Sansa a viewing of all the heads of her father's delegation, including her septa, but he doesn't mention a Braavosi that the traitors had smuggled into the Keep who slew several guardsmen and kept a member of the Kingsguard from apprehending a fugitive. Also, as mean as Meryn is, he never says anything about the encounter ever as far back as I recall. 

Perhaps it's because they don't want word of the death of a former First Sword of Braavos reaching his native land, but there's a new ruler now with his own First Sword, so I don't see why they'd be nervous to release those kinds of details; he wouldn't be obviously important to anyone in power anymore.

I am new to this subreddit so if this specific topic has been covered, (while my searches have been fruitless, at least for info that wouldn't spoil it entirely for me) I apologize. I have been (slowly) reading A Song of Fire and Ice for a short while now. I recently finished A Storm of Swords and was excited to watch the show as it unfolds with my friends who strictly watch on TV. (I quickly read the first 2 books and watched the TV series after I had begun the third book.) Without further exposition, my question, as stated in the title, is how much will watching this season affect my appreciation of the  coming books? Specifically regarding Theon, as it came to my attention in the most recent ep his story is fast forwarding a bit in the show (skipping an entire book??). If Theon's story continues to progress at the rate it seems to be going how much is going to be spoiled for a fellow like me who has not even picked up the 4th and 5th books in the series? For a guy who assumed that Theon was killed by Bolton's bastard (apparently as all the characters do in A Feast for Crows according to some internet sleuthing)?

Now here's my question, does Mel's magic result in Weddings of different colors i.e. Red and Purple and additionally the death of Tywin Lannister (Because those are the three people that Stannis wants dead most) or is it just a coincidence?

I finally started watching Season 1 of Game of Thrones and have just finished episode 8 ('The Pointy End'). I'm terrible at remembering names so have been making extensive use of the handy family trees that come with the DVD set but some questions still remain. 

I appreciate that some may be addressed later (in which case please feel free not to spoil it for me and just tell me to be patient) and others may be addressed in the books (in which case please feel free to tell me about it as while I may read the books in the future I'll have watched so much of the show by then that spoilers won't be a big concern). Some of my questions may also be stupid or have glaringly obvious answers that I should've already worked out, apologies in advance for those. I've read the spoiler-policy and I don't think there are any spoilers in my questions as they're based on the state-of-play during the first episode, if I'm wrong on that then please let me know what I did wrong before banning/yelling at me.

1) It's taken as read that the Lannisters super-wealthy, and apparently have been so for long enough for their informal mottos to reference that fact but I can't work out where they're getting all their money from. Any ideas? Is there a trade I should know about? Do they just own an awful lot of land?

2) Why, at the start of the show, is King Robert the king when everyone around him that got him there seems to be a Lannister and they appear to be paying for everything while only barely tolerating him? It seems as though the Lannisters should/would be running the show and I can't work out why they aren't.

3) The World of GoT seems to have plenty of agriculture and we have blacksmiths forging iron weapons (and plenty of metal being used all over the place) but I've seen no evidence of mining or other industries required to get the ore and whatnot to facilitate this - I feel like I've seen evidence for most other trades so this one feels conspicuous in its absence.

4) Can someone please reassure me that Magister Illyrio will be making future appearances because I bloody love Roger Allem and his portrayal of the character.

5) Am I ever going to learn more about the history of this World (like the Mad King) - there are many allusions to it and I assume it's covered further in the books but I'd love to be able to get a brief chronology of the history of the World leading up to where the series starts.

6) I wrote a question about magic/the supernatural and whether I should expect to see any humans with fancy abilities in the future of the show but I've decided to leave that one to find out myself.

Thanks in advance for humouring me with all this!

*EDIT* Additional bonus question: The maps and opening credits show me a nice (almost UK-ish) island with land off to the East where the Dothraki hang out - is that map going to wide out at any point? Presumably there are more lands over to the East? It certainly doesn't look like an Island. Looking at that map I immediately wonder what the rest of its globe looks like.",53,41,False,self,,,,,

How will they talk about this show 20 years from now? 50? 100?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ctew8/does_game_of_thrones_have_the_ability_to_alter/,[deleted],1366574239,"Ok bare with me folks, I'm pretty stoned and I've been listening to some epic M83.  This has all been inspired by a drunken conversation with a friend last night.  Bolded **TL;DR** below.   Otherwise, hopefully you find something to discuss in the rambling mess of letters below.  


Can *Game of Thrones* change everything about how we ingest visual storytelling (i.e. movies/television/youtube clips etc)?  I know that may be a pretty obtuse statement, but lets look at some information here.  

* Game of Thrones consistently ranks as one of the highest rated programs every week, especially in key advertising demographics (males, 18-49) but it does have proven cross demographic appeal, something surprising considering it is such a niche genre show with such a complex and challenging storyline.  Simply put, 10 years ago a show like this *never* would of gotten a pilot.  Anyone who does some reading about the Golden Age of Television would probably agree.  What's most amazing about this massive amount of appeal is that the show airs on a *premium* network, one that requires a monthly subscription.  And it *still* crushes it in the ratings.  Even then, it's cross demographic appeal is clear based on it being one of the most pirated shows ever.  I haven't even mentioned what most of my peers do, which is share HBOGO passwords... is that even measurable?  Simply put, *everyone* wants to watch this show, and they are trying to do so in any way possible.  It's referenced on broadcast network sitcoms, the stars are in supermarket aisle magazines... the show is *huge*.  It's not *Star Wars* big, but I'm guessing more people can name *Game of Thrones* characters at this point than *Star Trek* ones.  If not, we're getting pretty close.  We are through the looking glass here people. Reverse vampires, if you're into that sort of *Simpsons* reference. 

* Distribution for long form storytelling is changing.  In circles of people who care about ""teevee"" some are referring to right now as the *Silver Age* of television.  It all started with *The Wire*.  Or maybe it was *The Sapranos* (I give credit to *Oz*)  Some might tell you *Seinfeld* but really I tend to see anything prior to that as just plain sentimentalities.  The point being, at some point everything changed, and the networks made a clear shift towards more challenging, ambitious, artistic storylines.  At some point ""Teevee"" started becoming intelligent and challenging.  Even conceptually boring procedurals like *Suits*, *House*, or *Law &amp; Order* have to maintain long arching and captivating storylines to maintain viewers.  Sure, plenty just want to watch the *Ow, my Balls* variety of television, but the days of Lucy and Ricky sleeping in seperate beds are gone.   In 2013 we like our epics to be niche genre's with a cast in the hundreds, allegiances everywhere, and complex characters.  ""It's not TV, it's HBO"".  They're right.  They've changed the format.  What makes now the Silver Age instead of the Golden Age (late 90's to late 2000's)?  Television is more self aware, and has to react to not just the past 10/20 years, but try to tell innovative and interesting stories, in formats that haven't been explored (Mob Drama?  So 2000 and late).  Like epic 8-10 season fantasy novel adaptations.

* It went first from free over the air broadcasts, to pay premium provers (cable), and now we're seeing the rise of digital distribution.  And while some production companies and networks are hesitant to embrace the real advertising value of online distribution (cough, NBC, cough) the fact that HBO is *considering* working with ISP's to find a way to bundle HBOGO with a internet only package speaks *volumes* about the change that is a comin'.  People have seen the successful penetration of *House of Cards* on Netflix, and I wouldn't be surprised if *Arrested Development* breaks the internet a bit.  There is real *value* in online distribution now.

* It's not just the studios, advertisers, and networks that see this, it's manufacturer's and entrepreneurs too.  We're not talking about the vaguely controversial products like Dish's Hopper, or DVR.  We're not even talking on demand.  We're talking about new products like Areo which will allow broadcast shows to be stored on a hard drive, and because each until will have it's own antenna and there is no monthly subscription, the major networks can't really do anything about them legally!  We're talking about that device *Intel* is rumored to be working on that will allow you to pay per channel, instead of buying channels in bundles like the old, outdated cable model (WHY DO I HAVE 468 CHANNELS AND IT'S ALL SHIT I HATE!!!)  Fuck we're talking about the *Radiohead In Rainbows* or *Louis CK* model of distribution.  Shit is getting *cray*.

Basically, we have a *Perfect Storm (of Swords)* for just a major overhaul of the way we ingest visual media.  I don't know what's going to happen.  I really don't.  There are too many lawsuits and other variables at hand.  I obviously can't predict anything.  But I keep looking at the rising popularity of *Game of Thrones* and wondering... is this the straw that will break the camels back?  In the same way we went from radio to TV, and from pictures to film, and maybe even from word of mouth to written word... are we about to see an *evolutionary leap* in the way television will be watched?  A hundred years from now, where does *Game of Thrones* place in the importance of storytelling?  Will it be what *The Watchmen* is to comics?  Will it be *Gone With the Wind* or *Citizen Kane*.  Will it be more iconic?  Less?  I'm not really sure what's going to happen, but man... the posturing for power and the backstabbing and political ambitions between studios, advertisers, creators and viewers is just as interesting behind the show, as it is*on* the show.

**TL;DR:  What do you think will be the significance of *Game of Thrones* culturally?  When people talk about television and stories, what will they say about *Game of Thrones* 10 years from it's end date?  25 years?  100 years?**",68,48,False,default,,,,,

In short, it's fine to talk about leaked material, provided that the appropriate spoiler tags are used.  Please note that, in this case, a blanket [Season 3] or [TV] spoiler tag is *not enough* of a warning to cover leaked material.  ""Season 3"" and ""TV"" are transitory terms that include all of the currently *officially released* material, and so do not include anything from the leaked episode 3.04.  If you want to discuss material from episode 3.04, you must specifically mention that you are talking about that episode, not just season 3.

Also, a reminder that **our anti-piracy policy remains in effect**.  Nothing has changed simply because an episode was released earlier than intended.  The facilitation of piracy on /r/gameofthrones (whether asking for or providing links/streams/search strings/etc) after this warning will result in your immediate ban.

It's hard to say what their motives are, but there is a strong chance that they are not aligned with a Targaryen victory. We also know that they can change their faces and take on the visage of other already living people, eg Syrio=Jaqen=Alchemist=Pate. I don't want to get too tinfoil, but there is a strong chance that we have already encountered more than one Faceless Man in Westeros and Essos and haven't even noticed. If I was to place bets, I'd say its someone who hasnt had a chapter from their perspective, has had a *deus ex machina* type role in the series and their motives are unaccounted for. Remember also that they could have a well documented history, since anyone can have their identity taken.

The girl power on ""Game of Thrones"" was just fucking amazing

For the boys rolling their eyes, just realize that every storyline in fantasy/scifi/action ect don't show the storyline of female bond / politics more than ""bitch x is catty.  Fuck her.""

It's just very refreshing to watch, and I much more satisfying to see VS. chicks who do cool action things is haaaawwwt and boys think its haaaawt.  The women building alliances, and ""rope-dope"" is just well done

My question is, after todays episode (episode 4) I am totally motivated to begin the deep journey into GRRM text heaven, but should I be starting at book 1 and slowly working my way through? with the likely event I will not even complete the second one before season 3 ends? 

Or will I have more enjoyment out of reading season 3's book and then seeing how the show brings elements to life, then in the down time between season 3 &amp; 4, go back and read 1 &amp; 2's books for a bit of back story completion type action.

Advice is appreciated :)",13,0,False,default,,,,,

What stood out to me, is why would Viserys put so much faith in marrying his sister to Khal Drogo and his army if it seems the Dothrakis regularly have a new king. They say they follow the strongest of men, but surely the king can't be the strongest forever and it seems there is no particular royal bloodline. Much like a herd of wild animals, where the males battle during mating season and the strongest is head of the pack. It didn't matter that Daenerys was pregnant with his son (supposedly) when he was on the verge of dying, they were going to kill the child. Her brother was convinced marrying Khal Drogo to Daenerys was a failproof way of getting back on the Iron Throne. ",7,4,False,self,,,,,

Sure getting the screws put to you (literally) sucks, but still, fuck that guy.

Granted, I've only read up to the end of ASoS but I've always thought that Theon was the most ungrateful little cunt and I've never been able to relate to him. Sure, I get his identity issues and how living alongside the Starks kind of chaffed him, but he completely betrays them, takes up arms against them, kills their people, kills Ser Rodrik, etc.

Please don't spoil anything unnecessarily ex. If am right confirm my theory but if I am wrong don't spoil the truth. Feel free to speculate with me though. I want to get my timeline straight and there will be numbered questions(?^0) spread throughout. 

      Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon are wards of Jon Arryn(Ned maybe because Brandon Stark will be lord of Winterfell and Rob because his dad Steffon is deceased so they both need attention they won't get at home?^1). As wards they become close friends and somehow Rob is introduced to Ned's sister Lyanna whom he falls in love with (they wed?^2). There is a tournament a Harrenhal(?^3) for some reason during which Rheagar Targaryen fancies Lyanna(and takes her captive?^4). 

     *Now this event perplexes me because I view Rheagar as the villian as he is responsible for raping and killing Lyanna and in essence start the war. But everyone on the subreddit views Rheagar as valiant and noble. Even Jorah Mormont and other characters who seem pretty morally sound share this view.* 

      After(before?^5) Rheagar has Lyanna, Rickard Stark, Jon Arryn, and Hoster Tully mean to join houses by means of a duel wedding of Cat and Lysa Tully to Brandon Stark and Jon Arryn respectively. Rickard and Brandon Stark then go before King Aerys Targaryen to demand the release of Lyanna. Aerys burns them alive. Ned Stark (in place of Brandon) and Jon Arryn wed Cat and Lysa Tully at Riverrun. With the support of the North, the Stormlands, the Riverlands and the Vale, Ned and Rob march to war as Rheagar marches to meet them. The forces clash at the Trident whereupon Rob kills Rheagar, dividing and demoralizing Rheagar's army.

      As Rob finishes there, Ned rides to Kings Landing (which is already sacked) and then to Storm's End. Rob now sits on the throne but the Targaryen Queen Rhealla and kids fled to Dragonstone while Princess Elia(Rheagar's wife) and kids are in Dorne. Stannis Baratheon deals with Dragonstone and Gregor Clegane goes to Dorne. Rhealla's kids escape, Elia's do not. But where is Lyanna?^6 

     I know that during this time Ned fights three members of the Kingsguard at some tower, so where was that and where was Lyanna?^7 Then Ned skips to the memory of Lyanna's death and she asks him to promise her, but what is the promise?^7 Lyanna dead, Ned goes back home to Cat and to serve King Robert as Lord of Winterfell, but not alone. He has a kid!! When did he have time for that?(some random groupie of Ned's army?)^8 Maybe he didn't have time and Jon Snow is really the son of Lyanna Stark and Rheagar Targaryen?^9 And Ned's promise to Lyanna is to take Jon Snow as his own bastard?^10 So then did Rheagar rape Lyanna or was their love consensual and Rheagar's not such a bad guy?^11 
      What are your thoughts? I'm sorry for this ramble but I had to get it out.

It's about the issue of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys."" I'd say around 99% of the characters in the story cannot be truly classed as good or evil. GRRM says as much:

----------------------------------------------

""It is certainly a genuine, legitimate topic as the core of fantasy, but I think the battle between Good and Evil is waged within the individual human hearts. **We all have good in us and we all have evil in us, and we may do a wonderful good act on Tuesday and a horrible, selfish, bad act on Wednesday, and to me, thats the great human drama of fiction.** I believe in gray characters, as Ive said before. We all have good and evil in us and there are very few pure paragons and there are very few orcs""

----------------------------------------------------

Now when people say they hate Cersei because she's evil, they're not really getting a feel for the character. She wants to hold tightly to her son as a mother would and is often overlooked for her brother. Conversely, the way Dany reacts with cold-blooded vengeance can be difficult to justify as a ""good"" act.

Get inside the characters heads before the next episode, and when they make an expression or look; and when they say something interesting, you'll have a greater appreciation for their motives.

tl;dr don't be so quick to say this character is bad and this one is good, without truly understanding why they do what they do.",12,20,False,self,,,,,

So far we've had the reference to Tyrion's nose, the names Arya gave Jaqen being wasted, and the ""Mereeneese knot""...  This week was some Targaryen back history that occurred during the scene between Joffery and Margery, mentioning how two Targaryens met their end... The exchange I loved, as we have not had much history prior to Robert's Rebellion brought up on the show, so I thought for the benefit of non book readers I'd provide a bit more context to the Targaryens Joffery mentioned in the scene at the great sept in this week's episode.  The two people Joffery mentioned were Aerion ""Brightflame"" who died by drinking Wildfire, and Rhaenyra Targaryen who Joff mentioned died being fed to her Brother's dragon...  

Before I start a note on the spoiler scope of this post, I labeled it ""spoilers all"" because GRRM spreads out backstory over multiple books and you as a reader have to price it together yourself, the story of Rhaenyra Targaryen for example is mentioned in bits and pieces in multiple books, and new insights into backstory can be given even in the most current volume.  But I added the ""/ backstory only"" to say I won't spoil any plot in current story of the books and limit myself to just the backstory.. With that being said...

- Aerion ""Brightflame"" Targaryen

To be honest there isn't much context to add to him beyond the mode of death (drinking wildfire thinking it would transform him into a dragon) Joffery mentions in the episode. Other than when he lived and his relationship to any current characters on the show.  Prince Aerion Targaryen lived about 90-100 years before the start if book 1/season 1.  He is the second son of King Meakar Targaryen. He is also the elder brother to Maester Aemon who we see at the Wall.  He was never King himself.. He is also a major character in the ""Dunk and Egg"" series of novellas (The first one anyways).  I won't go further, and can't give context to the circumstances that led to him consuming wildfire, as it could spoil Dunk and Egg for you, so I'll just leave it there.  

- Rhaenyra Targaryen
 
Rhaenyra Targaryen lived 100 years even prior to Areion Brightflame, about 200 years before the start of the main story.  She was for the better part of her life the only daughter and child of King Viserys I.  As king Viserys produced no sons that lasted past infancy he named and raised Rhaenyra as his heir, and groomed her for rule.   King Viserys did however remarry however and was able to produce as son, who would become King Aegon II Targaryen; however even upon his deathbed King Viserys wished his daughter Rhaenyra to inherit the realm.  After the King's death there was a dilemma, follow the King's wishes and crown his daughter Rhaenyra Targaryen? Or follow tradition and crown his eldest son (Albiet by 2nd marriage) Aegon?  This decision fell upon the lap of the then lord commander of the Kingsguard Ser Christain Cole (who thereafter would be known as ""The Kingmaker"") who decided against his former King's wishes and crowned King Aegon II over his half-sister Rhaenyra.  Rhaenyra Targaryen did not take the decision lightly and this act led to the first major war of the Targaryen dynasty called ""The Dance of the Dragons"" which pitted the realm against itself, pitted brother against sister, and even dividing the Kingsguard itself.  The bloody war ultimately culminated as Joffery mentioned in the episode with King Aegon II feeding his half sister Rhaenyra Targaryen to his dragon while her children watched.  It is also worth mentioning that Rhaenyra Targaryen was not without a small reprieve.  King Aegon II died shortly after his half sister and without leaving an heir, so the throne did pass onto her eldest son Aegon III Targaryen.  As another small note Joffery mentioned that Rhaenyra's child saw his mother fed to her half-brother's dragon, this is true and it tainted Aegon's III opinion on dragons who developed a dislike for the creatures that it is noted that the last dragon died during Aegon III's reign, earning him the moniker ""Dragonsbane"".

Interestingly enough GRRM's next novella will not be another Dunk and Egg story, but be centered around the ""Dance of the Dragons"" and Rhaenyra Targaryen, so even us book readers have some more on her story to look forward to.

So there you have it, a nice chunk of backstory for you non-readers who might have wanted to know a bit more about the Targaryens Joffery was talking to Margery about in this last episode. I hope you found it insightful.

So the events that started this entire war were that Catelyn Stark arrested Tyrion Lannister because an assassin was sent to kill Bran Stark with Tyrion Lannister's blade (according to someone in King's Landing, Littlefinger or Varys maybe, I don't remember).

Tyrion's arrest leads to Tywin starting a war, which leads to the whole realm getting involved eventually (ned stark gets his head chopped off, etc, etc).

But, when Tyrion is in the Eyrie, he mentions (rightfully so) who sends an assassin with their own knife? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of an assassin? That, and based on everything else we know about Tyrion, it doesn't seem likely that he was the one who sent the assassin (also he was on Kingsroad like that whole time).

So, who would send an assassin to kill Bran? And why hasn't anyone in the show tried to figure this out? It could be as obvious as Cersei or Jaime, since they obviously wanted Bran to die in the first place, but why would they give some smelly assassin a really nice dagger that could be linked to their family? They don't seem that dumb.

Seems to me that whoever sent the assassin/gave the assassin the knife wanted to start something between the Starks and Lannisters.

Any other TV Show watchers seen any clues about what's going on there? And why no one on the show seems to care?",12,6,False,self,,,,,

From what I remember in the book Littlefinger is going to the vale to marry Lysa Aryn. Now in the show they have mentioned this. But then in last nights episode they were discussing that Littlefinger was going to try and marry Sansa. How could this be possible? Wouldn't this offend Lysa Aryn for her to think she was going to marry Littlefinger and instead he goes and marries Sansa, also wouldn't this greatly offend those who made this marriage possible (the Lannisters?). Also last question was this little twist introduced in the books? The only mention I heard of Littlefinger wanting to marry Sansa was from his mouth at the end of the book, but I never thought he actually intended to do it.

So at the moment Sansa is a pawn in a few different plans regarding who she should marry. Littlefinger wants to take her off to the vale so he can possibly be a future Lord of Winterfell (would it work that way?) and because he has a creepy obsession with her mother. Varys finds out and he makes a plan with the Tyrells that Sansa should marry Loras.

My question is regarding motivation. Is Varys doing it because he is scared of Littlefinger (""he would burn the kingdom down if he could be king of the ashes"") or just to undermine him? Also, why would such an arrangement benefit the Tyrell family, is it because Sansa is a possible Stark heir to Winterfell? (Follow up question, would Sansa be the Lady of Winterfell or would her husband be the Lord). 


Finally, Tywin sees all of this and decides to [ASOS](#b ""marry her to Tyrion"") (I was really shocked when this happened in the book, anyone else?) If marrying Sansa is such an important route to power wouldn't he have done this a lot earlier?

I'm realising there are a few questions in here, any responses are appreciated. ",17,5,False,self,,,,,

I don't think it happened. Since today I thought that this is what happened:

    Podrick became affectionate to Ros in the scene, where Podrick is grabbing the books.
    He then was gifted the whores but he didn't seem to have any kind of enthusiasm. It may have been shyness, 
    but I think he just didn't want those whores - he wanted/wants Ros.
    So he spoke with dem hoe's and told them to lie for him.

I suspect she is doing all of this at littlefingers direct bidding.

I suspect littlefinger foresaw that the quick-thinking tyrells would move to marry off sansa. This is consistent with Lady Ollena stating that it is ""rather obvious"", she has aready decided on the move without hearing varys's suggestion. Further evidence is Margery has already acted
to suggest the move to Sansa.

The next episode preview shows Tywin discovering the plot. I suppose littlefinger expected
Tywin to be slower thiking than the Tyrells, and moved to both ensure that the tyrells make
the plot and that Tywin discovers and reacts to it. For him it is better if Sansa stays in
Kings Landing, so he definitly doesnt want her whisked off to Highgarden.

I suspect Varys genuinely wants Sansa move to highgarden.

The question is how does Tywin discover the plot: my suspicion is that one of littlefinger's 
agents informs one of Tywin's. This will be interesting to watch in Ep 5.

I also expect a reveal regarding Ros at some point. I suspect strongly that she is loyal to Littlefinger.

His cloak with red fabric fixings should be a key factor to present to the viewer to separate his true reasons for leaving and also reflect upon the Night's Watch as a whole, and how Jon forms his own opinion of the Man himself. It maybe hard to show on screen, (showing a black cloak of fur with red fabric lined patches) but it should be addressed.

It seemed like taking candy from a baby. I don't understand why the Slaver trusts Dany and hands over his whole army without verifying his side of the deal. Maybe I'm missing something, but the whole thing looked way too easy even if you take into account that her knowledge of Valyrian surprised him. The scene reminded me of some kid tricked with an empty iPad package after he's handed over the money. :/

I mean why hand over an army that's taken so long to groom for something you have no idea about?

The show of blood and epicness has just begun. Continuing this weekly series, let's talk about the backstory of the events we've just witnessed.

**TL;DR: Stay a non-reader, but learn extra facts from the books that you need to know!**

Just one general note for the week: The show keeps explaining *a lot*. It's nice to say that the season split (third book, A Storm of Swords, is beign covered in seasons 3 and 4) worked really, really well. I have less and less to do episode by episode.

By the way, if you're new to those followups, take a quick look at the previous ones for this season: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1bfktk/followup_for_nonreaders_valar_dohaeris/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1bxkbg/followup_for_nonreaders_dark_wings_dark_words/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ceojt/followup_for_nonreaders_walk_of_punishment/) and keep in mind I'm not a native speaker and could have made some horrible grammatical errors - try to withstand those or help me correct them.

**Hands Down The Best Buddy Comedy in Westeros**

&gt; ""He's going to fall"" - Brienne, summing up Jaime's situation on more than just one level

* Since there isn't much more to tell until our company reaches Harrenhal in the next episode, let's focus on the book alternative of Locke - the Brave Companions. Even one of the captions on GoT's Facebook page was marked as ""Vargo"" instead of ""Locke"", for Vargo Hoat, leader of the group.

* Brave Companions were brought to the game by Tywin Lannister. Gregor Clegane wasn't the only pillager roaming the Riverlands. We see them first in Harrenhal through eyes of Arya. Remember those two guys from the cage heading to the Wall that weren't Jaquen? They (Rorge and Biter) joined the Brave Companions and helped Arya free the Northern prisoners from Harrenhal once main Lannister forces left.

* In *A Clash of Kings*, Arya witnessess Roose Bolton arrival at Harrenhal (Robb does not come there). The fact that Lord Bolton accepts the Brave Companions as his new mercenaries makes Arya hold back and refrain from telling her brother's bannerman the truth about her identity.

* Once the Brave Companions scatter, their only relevance to the story is Brotherhood without Banners hunting them down, so we may have lost some characters, but not much of the plot.

* As I added in a spoiler tag last week since I wasn't sure if this would get covered, Tarth is being called Sapphire Island for non-mining reasons. Good to see it got resolved.

**It's Always Sunny in King's Landing**

&gt; ""Ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practise it"" - Varys, explaining his beginnings as the [Anti-Mage](http://i.imgur.com/EGgQXrs.jpg)

* I'm really glad this did happen. After ""Blackwater"", I was afraid we will never hear the full story - but we did. This definitely helps portrait Varys as a man who knows what's going on.

* The Great Sept of Baelor! You might remember the outside of this place from when they chopped off Ned's head. Septons and septs got quite written out, making some people believe that the maesters are the priests. Maesters - scholars, septons - priests. Anyway, the High Septon is a part of the small council in the books. The new one. The old one got dismembered in the riot. If you hadn't caught up, the sept (the temple) is a heptagon and we've seen the heptagram a few times already. It's on the stained glass in the throne room, for example, also there were some appereances of the Silent Sisters with that symbol over their heads. The seven gods have been named in Robb's vow: Father, Warrior, Smith, Mother, Maiden, Crone and the Stranger.

* If we're talking about the gods, readers often point out the resemblance between the seven aspects and the Starks: Ned - Father, Catelyn - Mother, Robb - Warrior, Sansa - Maiden, Bran - Crone, Arya - Stranger and Rickon - Smith. Some of those make sense, some don't seem to do so... for now. There are many interpretations here, but I think associating the deities with the Starks can easy the proccess of memorizing the pantheon.

* Someone made a nice post expanding the story of [Targaryens who Joffrey talks about](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1cv338/jofferys_favorite_targaryens_further_context_for/). Notable point is that the war between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her younger brother Aegon (the Second), called ""A Dance of the Dragons"", resulted in Rhaenyra's son (Aegon the Third) making sure all the beasts who ate his mother die - and it was just one century after Aegon I conquered Westeros. The episode with Aerion Brightflame occured a century after the Targaryen civil war, when the dragons were no longer around, about 100 years before where show started.

* Another nice tweak to the story the writers did is not putting Loras in the Kingsguard. In the books this makes him unable to marry and Olenna offers Sansa to marry Margaery's oldest brother, who's a cripple.

* Mace Tyrell (Olenna's son, Margaery's father) is another person who got written out. He didn't bring much to the story anyway, acting like he's important while the battle of Blackwater was his first military success. The siege of Storm's End (the one that got broken by Ned and held by Davos) lasted for over *a year* and it was his only political presence in the history before he decided to support Renly.

**Ev'ryday I'm Shovelin'**

&gt; ""And now his watch is ended"" - Jeor Mormont, in a way leading his own funeral

* Well, the episode couldn't be perfect: what we're missing from the books are the last words of Jeor Mormont - he orders Samwell to go to the Wall with the news. His last wish is for his son, Jorah (yeah, the one with Dany), to wear black and he asks Sam to tell him that he forgives him.

* The renegades are busy pillaging Craster's basements and raping his daughters. Sam got some support from the eldest of Craster's wives. They told him to run away from the mess with Gilly as ""the sons of Craster are coming"".

**Bran** - well, here goes nothing. Sometimes a journey is just a  journey.

**Gods Help You Theon Greyjoy, Now You Are Truly Lost**

&gt; ""I chose wrong"" - Theon Greyjoy, thinking he understands how fucked he is

* YES THIS IS FUCKED UP AND READING THE BOOKS DOES NOT HELP NOT REALLY

* For the third time: a book reader has absolutely no clue about his fate until the story gets revealed in *A Dance with Dragons*.

* If you've been paying attantion to the details you can figure out what's going on, even though it's a little bit strange. You have a much easier job than a reader anyways.

* If you're planning on reading the books, now is the time to read them *all*. Theon disappears from the story for two books. His story remained a mystery for *over ten years*.

**Merry Men**

&gt; ""That's what we are: ghosts"" - Beric Dondarrion, the first vigilante superhero of Westeros

* Beric Dondarrion! This guy got re-casted, but you *might* remember him from Season 1 when Ned sent him after ser Gregor Clegane. He's being called the ""Lightning Lord"", as his sigil is a lightning.

* Beric has been presumed dead, killed in battle by the Mountain. Some rumours said that he's been hanged by ser Amory Lorch or that the Brave Companions killed him. As you see, the hunt is still on. You remember how they tortured people in Harrenhal to find out where the Brotherhood is?

* Lord of Light (R'hllor) is surely a new kid on the block. Thoros comes from Myr (south of Pentos, across the Narrow Sea) and so far his strange religion was considered part of his odd, drunken character.

**Daenerys Stormborn, DEAL WITH IT**

&gt; ""Dracarys"" - Dany, this time *really* beginning her story

* The epicness of this scene speaks for itself, so let's talk about where this language comes from and why Daenerys calls it her native. Oh, and by the way, the idea of pretending not to speak Valyrian was Jorah's. He's not *that* useless.

* Valyria was an ancient kingdom located on a peninsula in southern Essos (west of Astapor and Qarth). Right now it's a bunch of islands and ruins. You might remember (or much more likely you might not) that Quaithe, the masked woman in Qarth, has been tatooing a man to protect him on his journey through the ruins of Valyria (S02E07, right before the ""King of Qarth"" scene). This does not happen in the books, so some readers suspect the man being tatooed is a character from season 4/5, [AFFC but you're free to see the name](#b ""Euron Greyjoy, Theon's uncle""); there is a possibility that this was also the corsair who wanted to buy 100 Unsullied according to Kraznys (this one is in the book as well).

* What was the legendary ""Doom of Valyria"" is unknown, but it surely has something to do with 14 volcanoes located on the former peninsula. Anyway, before the Doom of Valyria happened, one of the houses, Targaryen (that's why they speak Valyrian), moved from there to Dragonstone in Westeros. When the Doom occured, they were the one of the only few houses to survive, with all the dragons left in the world with them at Dragonstone. Some time after that Aegon the Conqueror took his three dragons and two sisters and invaded the mainland.

* Overall, think of Astapor as a former colony of the Roman Empire where everyone spoke Latin once. Valyria is the Rome/Italia here. Since we're leaving Astapor, here's something more about the city which show portrayed as nothing but slave market: it's ancient, actually older than Valyria, with great pyramids, elephants and old customs... yeah, let's move on to the next place.

* Dany left Astapor under the rule of three wise people she chose. It's not like she burned it all to ashes.

&gt; **Cersei:** About Jaime ...

&gt; **Tywin:** What about him?

&gt; **Cersei:** I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back 

&gt; **Tywin:** When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?

&gt; **Tywin:** Whatever I can ...

This is clearly setting the Lannisters up for a *major* play and with him sealing those letters, I think he's most likely architecting [ASOS](#b ""the Red Wedding"").

It's that time of the week again where we speculate as to what Hot Pie has been up to.

- There was a lot of talk last week about the dragon Hot Pie seems to have acquired, what crazy antics has he been up to over the last week?

- Hot Pie seems to be branching into other baked goods such as bread. Wise career move? Your commentators think not.

- Was Hot Pie right to let Arya go? Beric seemed up for letting her fight the hound which, we feel, borders on child abuse

- Finally, does Hot Pie being in the background pave the way for a potential romance between Gendry and Arya? We've always believed in Hot Parya so are heartbroken.

I finished reading all the books about a year ago, but it wasn't until S3:E3 that I put this theory together.  In that episode, [Walk of Punishment](#s ""Tywin Lannister directs Littlefinger to travel to the Eyrie, woo Lysa Tully, and bring the Vale into the fold; Tyrion Lannister is then appointed Master of Coin.  Being the diligent character he is, Tyrion learns as much as he can from Petyr Baelish on how to act as the new Master of Coin.  In the show, Petyr states something to the tune of, ""They're only numbers on paper; once you've realized that, they are easy to master.""  Littlefinger turns over his ledgers and Tyrion begins to study them vigorously.  During his research, the Tyrion learns that the Crown is very much in debt: owing millions to Tywin Lannister and tens of millions to The Iron Bank of Braavos."")

Petyr departs King's Landing and heads for the Vale.  [ASOS](#b ""He really is waiting, not too far from King's Landing, on the plot to kill Joffrey to unfold and to steal away Sansa during all the chaos.  He later marries Lysa Arryn, effectively becoming the Lord of the Vale, and Warden of the East.  Some time later he kills Lysa, shoving her out of the Moon Door and blaming the crime on Marillion the singer, further securing his hold over the Vale of Arryn.  He is now named ""Lord Protector, holding that tittle until Robyn Aaryn is of age"")

Back in King's Landing, [AFFC](#b ""Noho Dimittis, a representative from the Iron Bank of Braavos, arrives to collect loan payments that the Crown has deffered (defaulted) on in the recent past.  Queen Cersei tells the Braavosi that the payments will be made once the Rebellion is over."")

In the Vale, [AFFC](#b ""Petyr must win over his new Lords.  Many oppose him, but he is able to weasel his way into keeping his role as Lord Protector.  He then discloses a plot to Sansa Stark that he has a plan for her to win back the North, which is now controlled by Lord Roose Bolton by marrying her to the heir of Arryn, Harrold Hardying.  Now, many may think Robyn Arryn is the true heir, and they would be right.  But that sick little boy, probably won't live to see his eighteenth name day due to his constant seizures, sicknesses, and fevers."")

At this point, the Iron Bank is done fucking around. [ADWD](#b ""They send and envoy named Tycho Nestoris to aid Stannis Baratheon, as long as he honors the debt the Iron Throne owes the Bank.  So now, Stannis has all the money he needs to battle with the Lannisters."")

[It is my theory that: ](#g ""Littlefinger sunk the Crown into debt on purpose.  He knew the only way for anyone to beat the Lannisters, would be to even the field financildally.  He now has the eldest living Stark heir at his side; he has the capacity to raise an army as Lord Protector of the Vale; and he possibly may hold sway over the future of the North.  Now that Stannis is backed by the Iron Bank of Braavos and the Lannisters are crippled with debt; Stannis will have a better chance against the Boltons in the North and Lannisters in King's Landing.  Littlefinger has put himself in a position to help either remaining side to victory.  Or, he could use his titles and armies to wage war on both sides and becoming King himself.  TL;DR Littlefinger is in such a position of power, he has a great chance of become Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.  He will develope a large army and will do his best to become king."")

Also, When is this dude gonna kill a walker? This is one of the most important scenes for Sam and it also lets the reader/viewer know the weakness of the walkers.

I will say though that it is very possible for him to slay a walker next episode and save Gilly and her child but I don't like that idea. The only reason he is able to slay a walker is because he is being a coward and Paul fights the walker head on and only after Paul has died and distracted the walker Sam kills him. He only kills him because he is a coward if they have him save Gilly it will be too heroic.

Potential spoilers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1cx7tw/magic_in_got_potential_spoilers/,[deleted],1366700474,"I've always loved the use of magic in the ASOIAF universe. Always subtle, understated, very dark, and offered sparingly. Also, sometimes very bizarre- as in Melisandre's smokemonster birthing.

I've observed how the show uses music to emphasize the various aspects of magic on display throughout the world. Melisandre's theme is slow, moody, and menacing. Her magic isn't grand or fantastical. It's horror, and it's very iconic- I.E. smoke monster. It wasn't something I expected the show to get right, but it actually improved upon it greatly. Unforgettable stuff.

In the latest episode (S3E4- ""And Now His Watch Has Ended""), the scene with Varys and Tyrion also carried a subtler version of Melisandre's foreboding theme as Varys recounts the tale of his castration at the hands of the very warlock he's unboxing. If I'm not mistaken, this guy is of the very order that pestered Danaerys in Qarth- also users of very dark, eerie magic, and scored accordingly with a creepy, atmospheric hum. The unboxing moment revealed an unexpected bit of plot for Varys, but I can see how it will tie into future developments with Tyrion post-ASoS.

And as for Danaerys, all the best moments with her and the dragons were underscored by tribal drum beats, very mythic, and in the case of S3E4's ending, epic. I hope they can keep the same composer throughout the series, or at least keep this kind of consistent work. It's hard to believe a television show can have cinema caliber music, but then, so did BSG.

Varys +11   (Season Total: +11) I don't even want to know what he is going to do to the dude in that box. 

Olenna Redwyne +10  (Season Total: +16) Behind the ornery old lady jokes, Olenna is a master schemer and so far really good at it.

Beric Dondarrion +7 (Season Total: +7)
 This guy has been really busy since we last saw him. As the de facto leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners he gets some points.

Little Bastard (Theon's rescuer/tormentor) +6  (Season Total: +9)
  That is just messed up man. 

Margaery Tyrell +5  (Season Total: +14)
She has officially mastered the art of Joffrey manipulation, but its granny that is pulling her strings.

Samwell Tarly +4  (Season Total: -6)
When the going gets tough, Samwell grabs a girl and gets the fuck out.

Sansa Stark +4 (Season Total: +4)
There's Something About Sansa. If only she knew how much everyone else was talking about her.

Tywin Lannister +3 (Season Total: +11)
 Tywin dishes out more tough love, this time to his daughter. Always the prick, but always right on the money.

Arya Stark +2 (Season Total: +8)
 Arya gives the Brotherhood a charge they can use against the Hound, earning props for her. 

Tyrion Lannister +1 (Season Total: +2)
 Got some much needed advice from Varys, listen well half-man.

Joffrey Baretheon +1 (Season Total: -8)
Just because his fiancee is hot.

Brienne of Tarth +1 (Season Total: +4)
That is what I call a pep talk.

Brann Stark -1 (Season Total: +3)
Catch the fucking bird already.

Cersei Lannister -3 (Season Total: -4)
While she is right about the Tyrells, her warning goes unheeded because she can't do anything else right. 

The Hound -4 (Season Total: -7)
 Still in some deep shit, but trial by combat at least you got a fighting chance.

Jaime Lannister -5 (Season Total: -7)  You drank horse piss. That is all.

Theon Greyjoy -10  (Season Total: -19) We all felt a little bit bad for Theon, but not that bad. 

Craster -20 (Season Total: -23)
 I'm surprised he lasted this long. Goodbye creep-master.

Jeor Mormont -20 (Season Total: -20)
 His watch has ended.

__________________________________

So as we all know, the Theon Greyjoy plot is getting its fair share of raised eyebrows and confusing questions. As a non-book reader (yet), I believe I have an idea of what is going on and I would very much love to hear your, the book-readers, feedback.

Turning back to the second season, Roose Bolton sent his bastard to retake Winterfell. Now, the Boltons, I think, are allied with the Greyjoys/Lannisters in secret and had Winterfell burned to the ground after they let the Greyjoy army go. 

However, Roose's bastard took Theon to the Dreadfort[?] where he is currently being tortured under watch from Theon's family, primarily his sister, to see if he is an honest Greyjoy. (We learned from last weeks episode that he is not, saying that his true father died in Kings Landing and that betraying Robb was a mistake.) I also have a feeling that the guy who freed Theon and recaptured him, is related. Possibly a younger brother? a cousin? Some kind of relative that snoops for the Greyjoys.

This is what I think is going on so far, that Theon is being tortured by the Bolton's with Greyjoy intentions to see if he can truly lead or be a part of their family. Also, that the Bolton's also have Jamie and Brienne and possibly plan on betraying the Starks and claiming Winterfell for their own. Somehow I feel that the Bolton's are going to play a big part in how the rest of season 3 and 4 unfold.",27,9,False,self,,,,,

When they only have two (with their wings serving as their upper arms) they are basically giant evil fire breathing birds. In Dungeons and Dragons these creatures are often referred to as wyverns (though they don't breath fire...I digress). All we have to do is look at popular movies to confirm this theory.

Harry Potter: 2 legs, fire breathing crazies

Dragonheart: 4 legs, voiced by Mr. Connery himself!

Reign of Fire: 2 legs, total dicks

Eragon: 4 legs, talking!

The Hobbit (hopefully): 4 legs, supremely clever - note: Smaug is almost universally depicted as having 4 legs in drawings. Still too early to tell if they are going that route in the movies.


Lastly, How to Train Your Dragon - Both. Nightfury has four legs and is quite smart. Many of the other dragons basically act like chickens anyways and only have two legs so I think this holds up.

Now, to the point. I think it makes perfect sense that GRRM's dragons don't talk. Personally, I think dragons look better with 4 legs so initially I was hoping the CGI would go this route. In hindsight, I am glad Dany has her wyverns. Was anyone else rooting for four legs? Discuss!

EDIT: For the love of the Seven please get past the title and actually read what I wrote before lecturing me about the definition of the wyvern. I was asking if people liked the decision to go two legs instead of four!",29,4,False,self,,,,,

It totally seems like something they would do, especially for the season finale considering the scene between Dany and Drogo in the House of the Undying from last season. Not to mention the fact that Bran's storyline seems to be everyone's least favorite and it would keep people more interested.

Battle of Qohor

The Battle of Qohor also knowns as the ""Tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor"", was a battle roughly four hundred years prior to the War of the Five Kings and took place outside of Qohor.


Prelude

After the Doom of Valyria the Dothraki first rode out east of the Dothraki Sea, it can be assumed that the fall of Valyria and the chaos that followed it is what prompted (and perhaps allowed) the Dothraki to attack with such power. 50,000 Dothraki, at least half of them warriors, were led by horse lord khal Temmo, sacking and burning every town and city in their path.
Aware of the Khalasar advance, the Qohor strengthened their walls, doubled their garrison, and hired two mercenary companies besides, Bright Banners and the Second Sons. They also sent a man to Astapor to purchase three thousand Unsullied.


Battle

During the first day of the fighting the Dothraki were unmatched, Qohor forces were shattered, its heavy horse annihilated and the sellsword companies had fled in the face of hopeless odds. The Dothraki had retired to their camps to drink, feast and rest before their final assault at dawn brake. However, during the night, the three thousand Unsullied had finally reached the city and come dawn, were waiting for the Dothraki horde arrayed in battle formation before the city gates.
The Dothraki, could have easily out flanked such a small force but in their contempt for infantry, launched a direct frontal assault, in an attempt to simply ride down the heavy infantry. Eighteen times they charged and attacked the Unsullied ranks and Thrice sent their archers wheeling past raining arrows on the Three Thousand, each time failing to break through.
Finally the Dothraki halted their attacks after the Khal, his bloodriders and sons had been killed. Their losses were staggering: 12.000 dead. Only 600 Unsullied remained, but the victory was theirs nonetheless. Four days later, the new khal led his remaining khalasar past the city gates in a stately procession. Each man cut off his braid and threw it down before the Unsullied.


Aftermath

Since that day, the city guard of Qohor has been made up entirely of Unsullied. Each of them carries a spear with a braid made of human hair attached to it.",127,335,False,self,,,,,

But as a reader, I'll spare our non-readers spoilers by sufficing to say that there are events yet to be depicted that will push the envelope of anything a television series has yet to attempt, even by HBO. And I'm not talking about Ros attempting a Meereenese Knot.

Just in terms of technical/CGI effects and Braveheart-sized battles, it will a challenge to pull off convincingly, and that's not even considering the biggest challenge--paying the cast. 

A large part of Deadwood's increasing budget demands (and downfall) was its fine cast of actors, who (rightfully or not) required more and more money to stay on. For those of you who never watched Deadwood, the actors clearly had leverage, as they'd become so identifiable in their roles that viewers were bound to reject recasting them. 

The same has undoubtedly happened with most of the characters in Game of Thrones. Could you imagine another actor playing Theon? Or Arya? Or Joffery? Heck, Conan Stevens appeared as Gregor Clegane in a couple relatively minor scenes, and the internet flipped its shit when another actor was recast for him in another brief scene...just image the outrage if Peter Dinklage demanded $10 million per episode to continue playing Tyrion? Who ya gonna call? Warwick Davis? 

Deadwood's end came back in 2006. Back when Netflix was a merely a thriving DVD rental service, rapidly sinking Blockbuster's obsolete Titanic, but had yet to invest in online distribution, and certainly hadn't yet considered producing their own content. Most recently, they've gone ""all in"" to become a major player large budget, self-produced content. 

From what I've read, producing 13 episodes for season one of ""House of Cards"" cost Netflix about $100 million dollars. I haven't seen it, and although it stars A-Lister Kevin Spacey, and was produced/directed by noted perfectionist David Fincher, I doubt it had comparable production costs associated with lengthy location shoots on 3 different continents, with extensive CGI and a cast of literally dozens of speaking performers. That said, the budget for only 10 episodes of season 2 of Game of Thrones was also roughly $100 million dollars.

I think HBO increased the budget for season 3 by about 15%, and I hope they'll continue to profit from their support and investment in a series we've all come to expect great things from. But should they pull the plug, I think Netflix might now have the vision, the audacity and [the financial resources](http://paidcontent.org/2013/04/22/netflix-q1-2014-earnings/) to pick up where HBO left off. 

Not to mention, you don't need a cable TV subscription for Netflix. ",6,5,False,self,,,,,

However, I was curious how many characters Game of Thrones has vs how many characters other shows have.  I couldn't make any google magic happen so I decided to try to figure it out myself.  This is what I came up with: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/KRJZYJW)


I collected the data from IMDB on 4/23/13.  It is based on the IMDB top TV series list and a few shows I selected.   Basically I just selected dramas from the top 50 list.  I did add a few procedurals because I wanted to compare those as well.  I also added TNG and The West Wing just because I like them.


Number of episodes is based on the actor with the highest appearances, not actual number of produced shows.  That info was just easier to find on the same page as all the other data.


    Number of Characters includes all characters with appearances &gt; # episodes x .1  

I did not want to get bogged down figuring out what characters are important/not.   Especially considering I have not seen some of these shows.  My thoughts are that if a character has not appeared at least 10% as much as the main character, they probably are not important enough to count.  Also some no-name characters can reach higher than 10%, so I hope it evens out. The Walking Dead has about 20 characters above the cutoff that are variations of Walker and is an example of artificially inflated character count.  


HBO shows are all reduced further because:

    Number of Characters is based on appearances &gt; # episodes x .2

  All the HBO shows seemed to have a lot more named characters than any other show.  To put it another way, HBO shows all have huge cast lists.  So 20% seemed to be a more reasonable cut off for that group than other shows.  Also because of the small number of episodes for some of the HBO shows the cut off would have been all the way down at 2 appearances (or basically everyone ever on the show). I could remake the graph with the 10% numbers if people want.  Basically what would happen is GOT and OZ break 100. The wire gets over 150 and Boardwalk Empire is over 200 (I have only seen a few episodes of Boardwalk Empire so maybe that would be appropriate but it seemed more likely to be following the trend of other HBO cast lists) 

I also sorted the graph from most episodes to least episodes.  So older or longer running shows are further to the left.  GOT ends up to the right because it is younger/less episodes.  I don't have the data to work out trends but I would assume the cast list is going to just keep growing over the coming years. 

I think the trends from the graph are interesting.  HBO seems to like a a big cast.  In general many of the shows in the top 50 have large casts.  I would have called LOST or The West Wing shows with a lots of characters but they are just middle of the pack here.  As expected the procedurals are way down. I think it goes to show just how much is being packed into Game of Thrones.

First I think that Margaery is telling this story to self-depreciate a bit.  This is to make her more relatable to Sansa and garner some empathy.  The first sign that she is lying is that she can't even keep a straight face when she tells Sansa about the porridge plague and how Lyanna died a horrible death. So if she is lying about that, why not the whole story?

The key sign to me is what she says afterwards ""ohh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome Lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the Sea.""  It seems a bit generic doesn't it?  While it might be brief because Margery doesn't care, or doesn't remember you'd think that she might recall the name of the Lord or the where she lived.  No, this seems too much of a fairy tale to me; a kind of fanciful tale that Sansa would have loved in her childhood.

I love the show's depiction of Margaery as a master of manipulation.  I think that she just made the story up as another part of the plan to have Sansa like her, and to add Winterfell's strength to High Garden's.",6,1,False,self,,,,,

Someone explain.

It's not like green is ""taken."" 

Edit: apparently no one really caught on to what I was saying. Here, from a reply I made extrapolating:

The point is that the costume designers or the directors or whoever have obviously made choices regarding the color scheme of the house. Like they did with the rest of the houses--The starks wore a lot of brown but their prevailing 'thing' were the animal pelt shoulder garments. This established a common visual theme to viewers--think about how often in firefly the crew is dressed in reds and browns, really earthy and homey 'family' colors compared to the cold, impersonal blues and purples of the alliance. A random alliance fed could wear black one time, that doesn't dissolve the overall theme.
So to go back to what I was saying, they have set up the tyrells' overall theme to be this light sky blue color with gold embroidery. Margaery in s3 has exclusively work the sky blue dress, lady olenna tyrell has only been seen in blue and gold embroidery, and their handmaidens also wear it. It's a theme, clearly chosen by the creators, to help viewers collate and identify them. And I'm asking...why blue? Margaery was specifically described in the books as favoring green gowns, for one.
So, no, I don't expect or want every single character to be 100% color coded. **But when the creators go out of their way to color code a family, and they get it wrong, I'm going to ask why.**",10,8,False,self,,,,,

Here's my issue (please change my mind on this):,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1czycm/i_think_the_daenerys_storyline_in_the_last_ep/,josephbc,1366791026,"She purchases The Unsullied by putting one of her beloved children/dragons into the hands of a psychopath (a mother's nightmare). She then commands her new slave army to demonstrate loyalty to her (their new master) by massacring their former master's 'enforcers' or 'manager class'.

So immediately after she deliberately reinforces their slave mentality she offers them freedom (something they've never known or long-forgotten thanks to their deeply traumatic conditioning). We're meant to cheer for her and them as they 'choose' to remain slaves? They don't know what 'free' means anymore, there is no choice for them.

Dany orchestrated a shallow 'liberation' for the sensibilities of us, the audience. She seems more shrewd and cunning (but no less ruthless and willing to enslave) than Kraznys.

I used to love what Dany symbolically stood for - now I think she's just another selfish, murderous, manipulating ego-maniac trying to get ahold of a metal chair.

I'm kind of heart-broken.

(Spoilers All),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1d0btx/what_does_tywin_think_of_all_of_this_spoilers_all/,T2000iceCOLD,1366811502,"I imagined myself being Tywin Lannister and wondered what he might think of all that has occurred in Westeros in the past year or two of his life and at first I thought I'd be pretty damn proud of myself and my family for turning this whole mess into a Lannister win, but then I thought about it some more.  My question is this:  Does Tywin know/suspect that Joffrey is truly inbred?  Does he care?  He's a ""godly"" man, to an extent, though he somewhat hates the gods as well, for what they've ""done to him.""   Does an inbred grandson on the throne help or hurt this godliness?  Surely he's got some thoughts on it one way or another.  

My original thought was that he'd be impressed with his daughter and grandson for taking the throne from the inside out like that, but I wonder now if he isn't concerned that Joffrey's inbred and the whole thing is a mess.  He seems completely oblivious/unconcerned with the whole thing, and is simply getting on the job of running the kingdom.  As I said, when I imagined myself as him, I'd be relatively impressed to have gone from being Lord of the Rock under a Targaryen all the way to having a grandson on the throne in under twenty years, and that after using another person's rebellion and reign as a piece in the puzzle.

TL;DR - So I guess what I'm asking is, more specifically, are the Lannisters flying by the seat of their pants here, or was this all a deftly orchestrated plot that was twenty years in the making?  Was Tywin involved, or did Cersei hatch the whole thing?  Finally - does Tywin know Joffrey (and the others) are inbred and does he even care?  Was it ""part of the plan?""

Obviously this is pure wishful thinking. But here's a list of the events that I would like to see get the HBO TV movie treatment. Please feel free to add or elaborate.

(For watchers only- I've included brief, non-spoilery descriptions of the events.)

Roberts Rebellion: Big Bobby B rebels against Dany's Dad. 

Aegon's Conquest: The Targs attack Westeros.

Dance of the Dragons: Historical Targ infighting.

Blackfyre Rebellion: More historical Targ infighting. but more recent.

Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion: Young Tywin Lannister is a bad-ass. 

The Long Night: The last time anyone saw the White Walkers.

Rise of the Valyrian Empire: The world discovers dragons.

Decline and Fall of the Valyrian Empire: Think decline and fall of Rome followed by rampaging Dothraki.

Based on episode names and what I know from forums and such season three will have:

(#b ""* Arya with the hound
* Red Wedding
* Brienne's fight with the bear
* Maybe Sansa's wedding"")

Season 4 will likely see:

(#b ""*Oberyn Martell and the fight between the him and the Mountain
* Joffery's Wedding""
* Tywin's death and Tyrion's escape
* Dany's seige of Myreen
* Bran and co. reach the wall/ Cold Hands

The whole part about Dorne just for the reveal at the end of the last chapter from the princess' POV, Brienne walking through forests because some dude thought he saw some fool somewhere, every passage that involved the motherfucking Greyjoys, I just somehow felt a lot of it could be done away with and the book would have felt no different(and possibly 300 pages lighter?). 

Since I'm only reading it now, I, at least, have the solace of finding out in ADWD if there was any point in spending hours reading about the various things Sam is scared of.

It seems like everything any Tyrell does is very carefully calculated to obtain power for the family, so what if Loras's relationship with Renly was solely a plot to help the Tyrells do just that? Like Jaime said to Brienne, the whole kingdom was aware of Renly's sexuality, so it doesn't take too much cunning to send Loras to King's Landing to ingratiate himself and gain influence with the king's brother. Then, once Loras managed to convince Renly to start a war over the Iron Throne, Margaery came along to marry him and formalize the Tyrell's standing in a way the rest of Westeros would recognize.

(Which isn't to say Loras didn't necessarily love Renly - Catelyn grew to love Ned despite it being a political marriage.)

But guess who has been cast? Stannis's own daughter, Shireen. Guess who also has king's blood? Shireen.

Melisandre is going to try to persuade Stannis to kill his own daughter. 

I think that will make the decision even more intense, because obviously he is more invested in his own daughter than one of Robert's many bastards.

Bonus points if Melisandre points out Shireen's greyscale as a reason to sacrifice her, and that sacrificing her to the glorious God of light is both an honor and a mercy.

He talked about ASOIAF and his book ""City of Thieves."" I didn't write anything down but i have the answers off the top of my head from the questions.

Someone asked how he was approached to write GOT. He said he was approached by George Martin's agent to write screenplay for ASOIAF. The agent approached him in thinking that it could be a movie.  David said he was at first not really interested into the fantasy series especially judging by the original covers of the books. He read the first book and rushed to talk to his friend Dan Weiss saying that he should read the books because he thinks it could be a great HBO Series. Dan read the books and agreed. They meet with George Martin for about 5 hours and had to convince him that they were ""the guys"" to bring his books to life. They told him that it would make more sense to make ASOIAF into an HBO series rather than a movie. George agreed and said he was a fan of HBO. At the end of the long meeting George asked David who he thought was Jon Snows Mother was and his correct answer sealed the deal.

Someone also asked are you worried that the tv series will catch up to the books. He said he was ""very scared"" but he has faith that George will get the books done before the show catches up. He said that they need to get the seasons done since the cast is growing up. He also noted how they are under contracts. He said to never count George Martin out, if he will get the books done in time. He also said that they know what happens in the unpublished books so if it came down to it they could go ahead of the books. George Martin apparently told them all his plans for the books in progress. He said the best scenario though obviously is to have the books come out before the seasons. He believes that they can make 8 seasons off of ASOIAF.

Another funny part of the interview was when he talked about the auditioning for the show. Alfie Allen who plays Theon originally auditioned to play Jon Snow. He was denied and was walking to the parking lot until they realized he could play Theon. Imagine if Alfie played Jon Snow...

It seemed that David and George have a pretty close friendship as novelists. David may have plans to write his own fantasy novel in the future. His book ""City of Thieves"" is about a city under siege. He has done a ton of research on cities under siege and during medieval times. I think it would be awesome if they produce a prequel one day. I think he could really nail Stannis holding Storm's End during the rebellion.

Melissandre leeched this boy and used his blood for her sorcery regarding Stannis' wishes for Joffrey and Robb to die - if I remember correctly, this was somewhere in the early parts of the book.


Stannis was frustrated that the sorcery didn't work because nothing was happening, but what he didn't know was that by that time plans for Joffrey's and Robb's murders were already in motion. In the end of the book his wishes come true and both die, altough there was a large gap between both events.


**Well in the show** there is no bastard boy from Storm's End and I had no idea where Melissandre was going in the previous episode - I didn't remember that from the books. I was looking on descriptions of the future episodes and two parts caught my attention - ""Melissandre pays a visit to the Riverlands"" and ""Melissandre reveals a secret to Gendry"".


At first I was like what the hell, man? That wasn't in the books! But then I understood.


Melissandre is going to use Gendry instead, Stannis will have his sorcery completed and then, possibly in the last episode, both weddings and both deaths will ocur at the same time.


It seems that the producers/writers of the show really want to put emphasis on Melissandre's magic unlike the books, in which her sorcery seemed to have no effect for a very long time.


Instead of waiting half the book for the effects viewers of the shows will see it all ( the sorcery, the plans for their murders put in motion AND the deaths themselves ) happen in just a few episodes which will lead them to put a little bit more belief into the whole magic thing and save them from the frustration Stannis has been going through.

In season 3 episode 4 Daenerys turns the Unsullied into free men with only a couple of sentences. I thought this was a bit too easy, considering their training and life as slaves. I suspect they rushed the dialogue (understandable), and I guess the book did it a little more elegantly.

With that in mind, I would be happy if someone could answer the following questions. I beg you not to spoil anything past this episode.

 * In the book did Daenerys also *seem to* make the Unsullied free men? 

 * Did the Unsullied also *seem to* accept this release and fight for her as free men?

 * Did she put more work into it than just a few sentences? If yes, did she do something in particular?

Again, I beg you to not spoil anything past this episode. If the answer to a question will spoil something, then please don't answer, or use the spoiler tags.

Thanks! :)",8,5,False,self,,,,,

I have recently finished ADWD and have since been perplexed about Jon Snow's real parentage and would love to get everyone's opinion on my theory.  While I have seen other similar theories out there, I personally haven't seen all of the same elements elsewhere, which is why I thought I'd post.  Again, Spoilers.

Theory: Jon Snow's mother is Lyanna Stark, fathered by Rhaegar Targaryen

Proof:
1. First off, nothing in any of the books has compelled me that Eddard Stark is a man to debase himself by having a bastard child, even during the turmoil of war.  Everyone who mentions him applauds him for his honor, even if they despise him. On another note, Eddard never claims to hold ill will towards Rhaegar, as does Robert Baratheon
2. Rhaegar Targaryen believed that his children would be the three heads of the dragon, fulfilling the prophecy of the ""Prince that was promised."" In the House of the Undying, Danareys sees Elia and Rhaegar with their newborn son, Aegon.  Rhaegar says that there must be a third head. It is mentioned later on that Elia had become nearly infertile, and Aegon had two wives, so Rhaegar reasoned that he must take a new wife to give him his third child.
3. Rhaegar gives Lyanna the flower denoting her the Queen of Love and Beauty at the Tourney at Harrenhall.  Shortly after, she was kidnapped by Rhaegar and taken to the Tower of Joy. Rhaegar spent time there with her until the war began to get out of hand, and then left for the Battle of the Trident.
4. Roughly a year after Lyanna was kidnapped and brought to the tower (enough time for conception and pregnancy), Eddard finds her protected by three Kingsguard.  A lot of protection for a mere paramour.
5. Eddard recalls that Lyanna was dying of fever, yet she was covered in her own blood (blood from childbirth?).  She was also surrounded by rose petals (symbolic of life, or birth in this case).
6. Last words to Ned are: ""Promise me, Ned."" This perhaps means that she asks Ned to take care of and protect her only son.  The dying wish of his beloved sister is enough to make Lord Eddard Stark feign dishonor for a lifetime. Ned raises Jon as his own bastard as to protect Jon's identity, as surely Robert Baratheon and allies would have the true living heir to the Iron Throne killed.
7. The Stark genes seem to be all or none in certain births.  Ned and Catelyn's children all have the appearance of the Tully line, yet Arya is Stark in appearance all the way through.  This could be why Jon appears to have zero characteristics of his father, because the Stark genes took over. On a possibly unrelated note, Arya and Jon are the two closest siblings of all Stark children. (Zero hereditary science used here, I just like the idea)
8. I wasn't able to scour every single passage from Eddard's POV, but at some points he refers to Jon as ""boy"" instead of ""son.""   At another point, while investigative the relevance of Robert's bastards, Ned digresses to thoughts of Jon, then Lyanna, then Rhaegar, interposing their possible relationships.
9. Melisandre takes severe interest into the life of Jon. Instead of following Stannis into war against the Boltons, she decides to stay behind at Castle Black with Lord Commander Snow. If you remember, she earlier chided Stannis and others for not letting her attend the attack on King's Landing. If success depends on her attendance, then why not stay with who she believes to be the reincarnation Azor Ahai.   I believe that Melisandre will save Jon from his recent attack and find out/reveal his true heritage. (Personally I believe that Jon is the true reincarnation of Azor Ahai/The Last Hero, who was fabled to have protected the realm against the Others during the Long Night.  There is little proof of this as of yet, but his induction as Lord Commander has got me thinking.) 
10. As stated before, Rhaegar believed Aegon and his children would fulfill the prophecies of prince that was promised/three heads of the dragon.  He seemed to be naming his children after the original trio of conquerors: Aegon, Visenya, and Rhaenys.  His first son and daughter were named after the two, and I'm assuming he planned on naming his third child after Visenya.  Obviously, Eddard wasn't going to keep any name given Rhaegar, so he renamed the son Jon.  I presume that he named Jon Viserys despite his own brother.
11. Related to this is the dragon that is meant for Jon, presuming that he will be one of the three heads of the dragon.  I believe Viserion to be Jon's future dragon.  Viserion is described as having milky white scales, and by others as white (resembles Jon Snow's direwolf, Ghost). While an assumed name, Viserys, is only somewhat similar to Viserion, and correlation doesn't mean jack squat, I think that the name similarities and similarities to Ghost are an awesome coincidence or foreshadowing. (Possibly menial, but Jon's Ghost seems to have characteristics similar to the title ""Song of Fire and Ice.""  White fur, red eyes. Ice and fire.  Small but interesting)
12. I realize that Jon obviously does not true Dragon's blood, as does Danareys, because he was burned when trying to kill the wights.  This does not discount his heritage one bit, but does bring cause for doubt.
In conclusion, I believe Jon Snow to be much more than a bastard of Eddard Stark.  I believe him to be part of the series' namesake, ""A Song of Fire and Ice."" Fire in his Targaryen blood (Fire and Blood), and ice in his Stark blood (Winter is Coming).  I see the three heads of the dragon being Aegon (although his naivet is cause for concern), Danareys, and Jon, with a possibility of Jon fulfilling further prophecies.   I'm obviously a sucker for speculation and coincidence, and I realize correlation obviously rarely equals true meaning.  Jon Snow really pissed me off in ADWD because of his helping Stannis and hurting the Night's Watch in the process, but he is definitely meant for more. Despite Martin and his series being a cruel mistress, I don't believe he would kill off Jon as he seemingly did at the end of the latest book, especially not with the Re d Priestess so near.  Please let me know of any flaws in my theory or additions that can be added to it, as I would love some feedback. (Be gentle on the spelling, grammar, and syntax. Very long and lots of made up words &gt;&lt;)

This could be why Jon appears to have zero characteristics of his father, because the Stark genes took over. On a possibly unrelated note, Arya and Jon are the two closest siblings of all Stark children. (Zero hereditary science used here, I just like the idea)

8. I wasn't able to scour every single passage from Eddard's POV, but at some points he refers to Jon as ""boy"" instead of ""son.""   At another point, while investigative the relevance of Robert's bastards, Ned digresses to thoughts of Jon, then Lyanna, then Rhaegar, interposing their possible relationships.

9. Melisandre takes severe interest into the life of Jon. Instead of following Stannis into war against the Boltons, she decides to stay behind at Castle Black with Lord Commander Snow. If you remember, she earlier chided Stannis and others for not letting her attend the attack on King's Landing. If success depends on her attendance, then why not stay with who she believes to be the reincarnation Azor Ahai.   I believe that Melisandre will save Jon from his recent attack and find out/reveal his true heritage. (Personally I believe that Jon is the true reincarnation of Azor Ahai/The Last Hero, who was fabled to have protected the realm against the Others during the Long Night.  There is little proof of this as of yet, but his induction as Lord Commander has got me thinking.) 

10. As stated before, Rhaegar believed Aegon and his children would fulfill the prophecies of prince that was promised/three heads of the dragon.  He seemed to be naming his children after the original trio of conquerors: Aegon, Visenya, and Rhaenys.  His first son and daughter were named after the two, and I'm assuming he planned on naming his third child after Visenya.  Obviously, Eddard wasn't going to keep any name given Rhaegar, so he renamed the son Jon.  I presume that he named Jon Viserys despite his own brother.

11. Related to this is the dragon that is meant for Jon, presuming that he will be one of the three heads of the dragon.  I believe Viserion to be Jon's future dragon.  Viserion is described as having milky white scales, and by others as white (resembles Jon Snow's direwolf, Ghost). While an assumed name, Viserys, is only somewhat similar to Viserion, and correlation doesn't mean jack squat, I think that the name similarities and similarities to Ghost are an awesome coincidence or foreshadowing. (Possibly menial, but Jon's Ghost seems to have characteristics similar to the title ""Song of Fire and Ice.""  White fur, red eyes. Ice and fire.  Small but interesting)

12. I realize that Jon obviously does not have true Dragon's blood, as does Danareys, because he was burned when trying to kill the wights.  This does not discount his heritage one bit, but does bring cause for doubt.

In conclusion, I believe Jon Snow to be much more than a bastard of Eddard Stark.  I believe him to be part of the series' namesake, ""A Song of Fire and Ice."" Fire in his Targaryen blood (Fire and Blood), and ice in his Stark blood (Winter is Coming).  I see the three heads of the dragon being Aegon (although his naivet is cause for concern), Danareys, and Jon, with a possibility of Jon fulfilling further prophecies.   I'm obviously a sucker for speculation and coincidence, and I realize correlation obviously rarely equals true meaning.  Jon Snow really pissed me off in ADWD because of his helping Stannis and hurting the Night's Watch in the process, but he is definitely meant for more. Despite Martin and his series being a cruel mistress, I don't believe he would kill off Jon as he seemingly did at the end of the latest book, especially not with the Re d Priestess so near.  Please let me know of any flaws in my theory or additions that can be added to it, as I would love some feedback. (Be gentle on the spelling, grammar, and syntax. Very long and lots of made up words &gt;&lt;)

edit: grammar

edit: I do realize that this theory has been proposed before, but I have never seen a legitimate discussion on it, and I believe I added some points to theory that I've never personally seen before",13,0,False,default,,,,,

It's a shame this show has such a large, talented cast, because even Charles Dance finds a way to stand above all else.

Only an understanding that calendars are inherently arbitrary.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1d85nu/no_spoilers_an_extremely_simple_explanation_for/,[deleted],1367085722,"**EDIT: Lunar cycles were just an example that are easily related to. What the year is based off of, be it lunar patterns or constellation patterns isnt really THAT important. What is important is that the seasonal patterns are completely explained as long as you realize that their calendar year is based on some measure that is much shorter than the time it takes their planet to orbit the sun once**

I know there are countless theories about how the seasons of ASOIAF work. I know most of them are fairly ""out there"" with wobbly axises, double suns, or weird eclipses. But I have a VERY simple, VERY easy explanation that more than satisfies Occum's Razor as well as having very few holes in it.

**Simply put, their solar year lasts so long, that our equivalent of a month is what they decided to call a year.**

To start ask yourself, is there any reason on Earth we HAVE to define a calendar year as being one solar cycle? Its taken as obvious, but is it necessary?

How it works: In short, what if how the people of Westeros define a year is different than we do? We use 1 rotation around the sun to define a year. 365 days is a managable number. But what if in ASOIAF the planet simply takes MUCH longer, say one rotation took say 10,000 days. Remember ASOIAF doesnt happen on the astrological planet we call Earth. Since that would be so long, what if they define a ""year"" similar to how we define a month? So how would they define a calendar year? What if there was another astrological phenomenon that lasted ~365 days, say like their lunar cycle. With this being a more manageable number they define that as ""1 year"". Suddenly a summer lasts many CALENDAR years for them. Same with winter. On our planet sometimes we have years with harsh winters that last several months longer than normal. In ASOIAF, this would translate to a winter that lasted many more years than usual, or even lasted many fewer years. Variable seasons are thus easily explained. On a planet that took say 10,000 years to complete one rotation, harsh winters may last hundreds or thousands of days longer than normal, aka many more calendar years in Westeros.

I could explain in much more detail but I think its fairly obvious in its implications. Its a SIMPLE explanation, it requires almost NO crazy magic, nor does it require ridiculous astrological explanations. 

**Things this theory can easily explain:**

1) How a calendar year in westeros can be one season

2) How Seasons in westeros can vary in length so much (a 10% longer winter on a planet with say 10,000 days/solar year is a lot more calendar years)

3) How one season can last many calendar years

**More stretch explanations this theory allows (these are more for fun and dont really matter):**

1) It can explain how many of the characters in the book seem to be so young yet doing adult things  (Dany is like 13 ""years"" old). If a year is one lunar cycle, and that lasts for them was say 500 days rather than 365. Being ""13"" years old would actually be a lot older than we assume. Who says a calendar year for them is 365 days?

2) How the characters in teh show are seemingly ""aged up"" in appearence. 13 ""year"" old Dany has actually be alive as long as  say 17 ""year"" old girl on earth, which is more how she is portrayed in the show


**There you have it. No *crazy* astrological phenomena needed with tilting wobbly axises. No magic seasonal patterns. Just an understanding that ASOIAF takes place on a planet that takes MUCH MUCH longer than ours to revolve around the sun, and thus that they use the definition of a calendar ""year"" in the same way we use the definition of a ""month"". They simply dont define a year by one revolution around the sun, because they dont have to. Every time their planet rotates around the sun once, many of their calendar years have occured. Calendars are inherently arbitrary**",13,0,False,default,,,,,

Roose is described as cold and calculating, someone who is perfectly willing and capable of being cruel to others in order to fulfill his own desires. Ramsay Snow is Roose Bolton's bastard son, who he initially would have nothing to do with, sending Reek to be his caretaker and keeping him somewhat hidden in Ramsay's mother's possession.

Ramsay ends up poisoning and killing his true heir before the beginning of the series, and so Roose allows him claim to the Dreadfort and the house name? He spared him as a babe because of the similarity he saw in his eyes, but when Roose learned that he was an uncontrollable psychopath, why didn't he just have him killed?

Surely Roose Bolton is not too old to father another child. Ramsay consistently disobeys him, and causes the North's people to resent the house.",7,5,False,self,,,,,

In case you do not know, this is called a ""word cloud"", a visual representation of the most frequently used words in a passage are, where the more frequently used words are larger, in this case like Victarian and Lord.  The passage I used for this was the entire ""Reaver"" chapter in AFFC, as it is my favorite chapter in the book and the series thus far (I'm a quarter-way through DWD).  I plan on doing five of these (one from each book thus far) depicting the best chapters from each book and frame them.  I plan on having all of the backgrounds be black, and all have the same speech bubble shape.  So my question to you all is this: What chapters from GoT, CoK and SoS (refrain from DWD right now, or place spoilers if you have to speak your mind) should I do for the rest? I would like all of the chapters be from different viewpoints.  And thanks.",2,3,False,self,,,,,

I was motivated to think along these lines when I had a discussion with a friend who pointed out that in the LOTR trilogy, a thousand years pass but technology remains quite the same...

If we apply the same line of thinking to Westeros, we arrive at a similar conclusion, by all accounts, the seven kingdoms and the world surrounding them has a documented history that goes back at least Eight Thousand years (When the first men arrived). If that is contrasted to our own history, the world that is depicted in ASOIAF roughly matches up to Medieval times. While it only took us around a thousand years to arrive at where we are today, why is Westeros still stuck (technology-wise) in the dark ages? What factors prevent the people from advancing civilization?

I personally have two opinions on the matter:

* When Jon is made Commander of the night's watch and he sends Sam to investigate the archives, Sam theorizes that perhaps the history of the Night's watch is not as old as previously thought. Maybe this can be applied to the history of all Westeros but granted this is not a strong case to make

* On the other hand, tying in to another theory which states that the Gods in the world of ASOIAF are very much real entities that are fighting out proxy wars through their acolytes. So it is possible that the Gods keep the populace ignorant and miserable, where they have to constantly keep up their guard against White Walkers and similar supernatural threats so that they may rely completely on the mercy of their Gods.

Easy enough, and I feel that this change was handled well. But, the Brave Companions go on to resurface again in Brienne's AFFC arc. First, she encounters Shagwell, Timeon, and Pyg at the Whispers with Nimble Dick, and later she has a confrontation with Rorge and Biter. Now, Rorge and Biter are a part of the show, and their part can play out more or less the same, I believe.

But, what of the encounter at the Whispers? I believe that Locke and some of his men can resurface here, possibly having deserted Bolton's forces, leaving him as a running antagonist for Brienne. I'm hoping that he'll still have his ear bitten off by Brienne, which will give him a personal grudge against her. It may be that he'll die similarly to Vargo, killed not long after the Bear Pit incident, but I think they've made a good character with Locke, one that also has a distinct and memorable appearance, and I'd honestly like to see more of him. I was hesitant about him at first, but Noah Taylor has definitely given us a good character that embodies the brutality of what the Brave Companions were in the books.

Of course, this is all assuming that Brienne's story isn't radically changed. Her AFFC story is a lot of pointless walking and chance encounters. She's looking for Sansa, and the viewer/reader knows she's completely off base. Still, a simple plot line can be crafted to fill two seasons:

Season 5: She comes across Pod, meets Hyle Hunt and is taken to Randyll Tarly. Then she meets with Nimble Dick, travels to the Whispers, and encounters Locke and some men (some rewrites would be necessary, but I could see this playing out). They tell her that they heard the Stark girl is with the Hound, Dick is killed, and she meets back up with Hyle Hunt, who says that Randyll sent him.

Season 6: Talks with Randyll Tarly and Septon Meribald, heads to the Quiet Isle, hears that ""the Hound is dead"", continues to the Inn, is attacked by Rorge and Biter, saved by Gendry. She's then taken before Stoneheart and hanged. [ADWD](#b ""They may close the season with her telling Jaime that the Hound has Sansa."")

What do you think will happen with Locke? Will he end up only being Vargo's replacement, and die at the end of Season 3? Or might he resurface later? I guess we'll find out in the coming weeks. 

And what of Brienne's storyline? It has a lot of ""look how the country's been torn apart"" scenes, and is a shaggy dog story, but it has some events that actually prove relevant (it would serve as an introduction to Randyll Tarly since he was cut from season 2, it lets us know the fate of the Hound and Sandor Clegane, it brings Gendry up again, and we see Lady Stoneheart).

So I compiled Season 02 for everyone and put it on its own playlist. I really cant believe that one guy Ramin Djawadi composed all of this music! Except for one song ""The Rains of Castamere"" George R. R. Martin helped write it and it was performed by The National. I can't find the list of tracks for Season 3 but I will add them as soon as I can find the song titles.

I'm also aware that a webcam pointed at a screen could be bad quality...but maybe there's a way to route the TV into a web streaming service? I'm slightly tech savy, but not savy enough to put something like that together, I also don't have HBO.

Despite widespread hate of the fourth volume of ASOIAF, I didn't think it was quite as bad as all the reviews I read made it out to be. That being said, it paled in comparison to the first three volumes, each of which took me less than a week to complete. A Feast for Crows was the first book of the series I felt I had to force myself through, largely because of the absence of my favorite characters(Tyrion and Bran) and while lots of plot lines were set up, the book ended in somewhat of an anticlimax. So my question for you is, should I bother reading A Dance with Dragons? Every review I read makes it out to be utterly terrible, and, being a huge fan of GRRM, I find it hard to believe it could be so bad.

1. I thought Thoros of Myr was the war priest who weilded the flaming sword? Is it a trick he taught Beric or what?

2. Is Robb Stark in possession of Ice, the sword of House Stark? I'm guessing not since he didn't use it for the execution tonight. 

3. Is the god that Thoros of Myr and Beric follow the same that Stannis and his people follow?

4. Is Stannis' wife and daughter in dungeon cells or is that just how the keep at Dragonstone is built?

5. What were the bad intentions of the Tyrells that Cersei was speaking about with Littlefinger?

&gt;There it is. That's the look. I've seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me.  Kingslayer. Oath breaker. Man without honor.  You've heard of wildfire?

&gt;Of course. 

&gt;The mad king was obsessed with it.  He loved to watch people burn--the way their skin blackened, blistered, melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like; he burned ants that disobeyed him; he burned anyone that was against him.  Before long, half the country was against him.  Aerys saw traitors everywhere, so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city: beneath the Sept of Baelor, the slums of flea bottom, under houses, stables, taverns, even beneath the Red Keep itself.  Finally, the day of reckoning came.  Robert Baratheon marched upon the capitol after his victory at the Trident.  But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that.  He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the mad king as much.  I urged him to surrender peacefully.  But the king didn't listen to me, didn't listen to Varys, who tried to warn him.  But he did listen to Grandmaester Pycell, that grey sunken cunt. ""You can trust the Lannisters,"" he said. ""The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.""  So, we opened the gates and my father sacked the city.  Once again I came to the king begging him to surrender.  He told me to bring him my father's head.  Then he turned to his pyromancer, ""Burn them all,"" he said.  ""Burn them in their homes, burn them in their beds.""  Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men women and children were burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?  First, I killed the pyromancer, and then when the king turned to flee I drove my sword into his back.  ""Burn them all,"" he kept saying.  ""Burn them all.""  I don't think he expected to die.  He meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again reborn as a dragon and turn his enemies to ash.  I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.  That's where Ned Stark found me.  

&gt;If this is true, why didn't you tell anyone?  Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

&gt;Stark.  You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?  He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.  By what right does the wolf judge the lion?  By what right?

And also, perhaps a good discussion about the juxtaposition of the book with the tv series would be so amazing.

I guess what I'am trying to do with this post is be able to correctly read what I want to be able to express as to how and why this show is so breathtaking and mind-blowing.

Dany also already alluded to the fact that she was aware of Jorah betraying her (some point in SE2 in Qarth) although it wasn't explicitly stated it was the informing.

So, taking both these things into account how will Jorah eventually be banished by Dany? After what Selmy said about his reputation could he go of his own accord? I just can't see Selmy convincing Dany to exile him purely due to his reputation in Westeros.

Last week I provided a bit of context to last weeks episode by going through a bit of backstory in regards to Aerion Brightflame and Rhaenyra Targaryen that Joffrey mentioned in that episode, so I though for the benefit of of non readers I'd provide A bit of context to something that came up on this week's episode.

Before I start a note on the spoiler scope of this thread, it's labeled ""spoilers all"" because as I mentioned last week, backstory in ASOIAF is provided in small increments over all the books, and the reader has to piece the bits together themselves.  That being said discussion here is limited to backstory only, and any plot details concerning was has yet to come from future books in the main story will be hidden behind the appropriate spoiler tags. Edit to add: Anything in the books prior to where we are in the show and all aired episodes is open as well. 

With the formalities out of the way, on to this week's topic..  This week pertains to the hot tub scene and the dialogue between Jaime and Brienne and the revelation of Jaime's true motives behind him slaying the king he was sworn to defend.  

This scene in the show was pretty much on par with the book and I couldn't be happier, learning that Jaime broke his oath not for selfish reasons but to prevent genocide is one of my favorite parts of ASOS and was a turning point where I (as well as a lot of other book readers) changed our opinions and started liking Jaime, and I think that came across well on the show. But as good as the scene was there can be context added.

Lets start out with what info the show provided:  After the loss at the battle of the Trident the war was lost, Aerys realized this and formulated his plot to burn Kings landing (and its inhabitants) to the ground should the rebels take the city by placing strategically hidden caches of Wildfire throughout Kings Landing.  After Tywin began his sack Aerys gave the order to his pyromancers to carry out his plan, but Jaime intervened killed the king as well as the pyromancers who knew of the plot.  As noted in the show only Jaime knows the truth of this and regrettably his noblest act became the one he is most reviled for.  Jaime also mentions that prior to the sack Aerys had those who disagreed with burned alive in wildfire, developed a sick taste for doing so and became what inspired him to come up with his ""burn the city to the ground"" plot...while viewers already know of how wildfire was used in the deaths of Ned's father (through the show as well as season 1 blu ray extras), but viewers will not know that another person who suffered the same fate was a former hand of the king, but more on that in a bit.  There were a couple of clues in A Clash of Kings that eluded to the Aerys wildfire plot that didn't make it into the show last season so for context I thought I'd point them out here.

- As Tyrion is preparing the city for siege prior to the battle of Blackwater he is discussing wildfire with the Pyromancer Hallyne and is told that caches of wildfire had been found, and he particularly noted to Tyrion a very large stash beneath the sept of Baelor that scared the hell out of the Great Septon, and that there are likely more unknown throughout the city.  Since Jaime killed all the pyromancers ""in the know"" regarding Aerys' plot.  The current pyromancers guild, including Hallyne have no idea of if and where other stashes might be... So they're still there underneath King's Landing at out current point in the story.

- The house of the undying is very different in the books than it was in the show.  Dany sees much more visions in the book than the show.  Some of which showed past events, some were prophetic... One of the historical visions Dany sees in the HotUd is as such (copied from Wiki of Ice and Fire)... ""An old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says ""Let him be the king of ashes"" ""
Given what viewers learned this past week we know what Dany's vision there now means, but it was another hint to readers about Aerys' plot in ACOK before we got the full truth in ASOS

Now that we've got that out of the way I want to discuss the office of Hand of the King, particularly the last 2 that served under Aerys.  But first a recap of the people who held the office prior to them.  First was as you know was Tywin Lannister who served as hand under Aerys for over 20 years before resigning after Aerys ""stole his heir"" and named Jaime to the Kingsguard. Next came a man by the name of Jon Connington who is the only other hand under Aerys to leave the office with his life, as he was exiled by the king after losing the Battle of the Bells during Robert's rebellion. (Viewers might recognize that name as I believe the battle of the bells was discussed in one of the season 2 Blu Ray extras).  But it's the last 2 hands of the King that have relevance to our topic.. The next being Lord Qarlton Chelsted who was Aerys' hand up until 2 weeks before the sack.  While he was not mentioned on the show he too knew of Aery's wildfire plot, and protested, when he could not talk the King out of burning the city down he too resigned office... Aerys did not like that, not one bit and for his humanity Lord Qarlton Chelsted was dipped in wildfire and burned alive.

Aerys line of hand of the king ended with a man named Rossart, who was the head of the Alchemist's guild at the time and worked with Aerys in setting up and (almost) carrying out his plot..before he was slain by Jaime Lannister.  In last nights episode Jaime does mention him, not by name, but does say he killed ""The Pyromancer"" before Aery's plans could be fulfilled.  Jaime in the show does not mention that this man was also Aerys' last hand of the king.  There is also a great bit in the book where Jaime is reflecting on the Wildfire plot, and recalls that while many fixate on him killing the king, that no one ever asked about The King's final hand Rossart and how he met his end, further adding to the tragedy that no one knows of Jaime's greatest act...

My friend had been telling and telling me to watch GoT so recently (Friday) I rented the first disc of S1 to see if I'd like it, I loved it. My wife, not so much, but she came around. I rented the rest of S1 and watched it (Saturday), then watched almost all of S2 yesterday.

My wife and I are hooked, so my question is, since we don't have HBO and don't want to wait till Feb/March 2014 for the S3 DVD release, are there any alternatives to getting in on S3? 

My friend suggested some Torrent sites, but I'm weary of those because I've previously gotten a virus and it RUINED my already ancient laptop. 

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!

I seem to be missing something because I find her not to be particularly special. She probably breaks every fantasy trope in existence, and I don't see anything that is creative or original in her character design.

If I ignore the problems in her unoriginality(lets be honest we need to do this for most characters on GoT's), then I realize how unlikable she is. She has snapped, and flipped out on her advisers for the most insignificant actions. She is no more likable than Joffrey.

These are just a few of my gripes, surely I cannot be the only one that sees these problems. This is why I like Tyrion a lot, not only is his character likable and clever, but he is also original.

Edit: hmm, always downvotes without any reply, I might take this over to true televsion.
Edit2: Forgot to mention that she basically is a ""Mary Sue"". I even think she was written into show and books as an after thought. She is the only throne chaser without any real people of her own.

1) When Theon managed to escape with help in S03E04 he ended up in the very same place. This was really confusing to me because why would they go through so much trouble (Risk that he gets away, kill their own people, time) just to mess with him? The guys who tried to rape Theon was killed and for what? Just so someone could have some fun with Theon?  
2) Wouldn't Theon recognize where he was? Okay, he entered at some weird door but if you were to be transported to safety and instead was brought back to the very same place, wouldn't you regognize something? Maybe notice that you're going in a circle?  
3) In the last episode (S03E05) Robb sentenced the Karstark men to death by hanging. He tells the guards to throw Lord Karstark into the chamber. Next scene we see him chop his head off. What made Robb change his desicion and how could he think it was worth it consider he suspected the rest of the Karstark men would turn on him?  
4) When I've lurked this reddit I've seen a lot of comments about Cersei fucking around. I haven't got this impression by the show at all. Is this something they've decided to leave out of the show or hasn't she started yet?  
5) Has Robb yet addressed the fact that he is betrothed to that other daughter? I feel like he just ""Well, now I'm in love so I'll take this one instead."" without noticing the old man? If this will be addressed in the future, don't spoil it - just go with a ""You'll see""  
If someone could answer these questions I'd be very grateful!",20,7,False,self,,,,,

Plus, as far as I remember it wasn't Bran falling that started the conflict. It was the attempted assassination of Bran later on that started it. While they probably were related, we never found out who sent the assassin, so there's a chance it wasn't related.

It has been quite a week for our little crustacean, although his presence this week was more implicit than in-your-face.

- A lot of people were speculating last week that Ned Stark had somehow warged into Hot Pie. We have considered in some depth the intricacies of such an arrangement, but have concluded after much discussion that Ned cannot be Hot Pie because he doesn't have the gravytas to control Hot Pie's infant dragon. 5/10 for effort.

- In an episode which saw Tywin marrying off his two eligible children for pielitical  means, we were surprised he didn't order Cersei to marry Hot Pie as a means of bringing his dragon under Lannister control. Perhaps because our hero is too busy baking assorted snacks for the royal wedding. 

- There has been must discussion over Loras Tyrell's favourite flavour of pie. We think chicken, leek and carrot. Do you agree?

- Beric's resurrection begs the question of how many times Hot Pie has been brought back to life, presumably with a little bit of crust worn away each time.  

- Would Hot Pie break his oath and murder his King or watch thousands of pies burn in their beds?

**Hellhound**

&gt; ""Second time I've been killed by Clegane."" ""You'd think you'd learn"" - the runner-up at the Best Buddy Comedy of Westeros

* In case you forgot: Sandor Clegane is afraid of fire. I think the scene showed.

* As you see, the various rumours of lord Beric's death were a little bit exaggerated... or the other way around.

* We've already heard the tales about Thoros's flaming sword. What Tyrion (while inspecting wildfire production) and Gendry point out, though, is that it was merely a trick with wildfire which greatly damaged the blades used. The fire that the Lightning Lord (Beric's nickname, no wonder it got cut out as it's confusingly similar to R'hllor's title ""Lord of Light"") was definitely not green.

* Since I already saw questions like this raised: yes, this is the same religion that Melissandre follows. Those two are the only priests in Westeros that we know of, the cult is much more prevalent in the free cities of Essos (hence Thoros of Myr) and Asshai beyond the Shadow (where the red woman came from).

* Beric Dondarrion has lost most of his memories due to the consecutive ressurections. He vaguely recalls even the most important ones (his home, his wife) and is greatly upset by that. He might look badass, but he's a shadow of his former self.

**A Warm and a Wet Place**

&gt; ""I don't want to ever leave this cave, Jon Snow"" - Ygritte, soon to regret those words, possibly as soon as she gets all damp out to the cold

* Some of the 19 castles by the Wall are already in ruins. Others were abandoned due to lack of men to man them. Castle Black - this one we've already seen; Eastwatch-by-the-sea and the Shadow Tower mark the eastern and the western ends of the Wall.

* Ygritte's first partner tried to - according to tradition - steal her from her tribe to make her his wife... he didn't succeed. Wildlings don't mate inside their tribes - they take their wives from the others.

* Book Jon got tricked into breaking his vows in a little bit different way: when his intentions got questioned, Ygritte vouched for him by saying they already did it. Which made actually doing it for the first time tad less vow-breaking on Jon's part. Furthermore, Jon's hesitance about sex wasn't just about breaking his vows. Due to his own upbringing, he never wanted to father a bastard. He tells Ygritte this, and she talked about the wildling marriage custom. She tells him that they basically were married when he took her prisoner, so any children she had as a result of their fun wouldn't be bastards.

**The Hurt(ing) Locke**

&gt; ""Jaime... My name is Jaime"" - The Kingslayer

* The maester taking care of Jaime, Qyburn, is the same man who Robb found in Harrenhal in S03E01. The maester's chain he got stripped off of represents particular sciences a maester had learned - each science has a corresponding metal the link is made of. Gold is for economics, silver for medicine, bronze for astronomy, copper for history, iron for warcraft etc. You might remember maester Luwin showing Bran his link made of Valyrian steel (which confirms studies in magic). Measters study at the Citadel in Oldtown, which is a large city in the Reach.

* Milk of the poppy is more or less morphine. Jaime refuses to use it as he isn't the kind of man who would want to die on anaesthetics... or worse, lose the rest of his arm once he passess out. An exiled maester isn't exactly a trustworthy physician.

* Okay, so the bath scene got delivered *perfectly*... but might have been a little bit hard to understand. [Here you have a full transcript](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1dbi8h/s3e5_spoilers_jaimes_monologue/) and [here's some more backstory](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1dc60h/aerys_wildfire_and_his_hands_of_the_king_context/).

* About people getting burned: The Mad King, father of Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys's, killed Ned's older brother Brandon and boiled alive their father Rickard while Jaime watched. This scene was meant at first to be the opening of S01E01 (glimpse of a bound man can be even seen in the first trailers).

**Lion King**

&gt; ""she gets fucked over in one way or another because it's Sansa"" - (non-reader) /u/flyingTV in predictions for this episode

* I probably mentioned it already a few times, but show unravels quite a bit of Littlefinger's plots where the books hid them. Of course the only two narratives in KL are Tyrion's, who can't be sure about LF's true intentions, and Sansa's, who's even more oblivious there as Petyr doesn't approach her directly.

* Numbers! As you see, Dany's army isn't *that* impressive when compared to Tyrell forces. One set of numbers we missed are the plans for Joffrey's wedding. 7 minstrels, 77 dishes... the list goes on.

* The Tyrell who Sansa were and Cersei is supposed to marry was Loras's older, crippled brother Wyllas. Not much difference for Sansa, but much more disgrace to Cersei.

* Note how Tywin is trying to secure Lannister control over the whole realm: North - Tyrion, Reach - Cersei, Dorne - Myrcella. With Littlefinger securing Riverlands from Harrenhal and the Vale from marriage with lady Arryn and also Tommen Baratheon inheriting Stormlands after Stannis and Shireen this sets up for a perfect plan of absolute control.

**The Man Who Passes the Sentence Shall Swing the Sword**

&gt; ""This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die"" - Robb Stark, reminding us that he can still top himself at being a badass

* Rickard calls Robb a kinslayer, but Starks and Karstarks have *really* distant ancestors.

* Karstark was Robb's main bannerman once he left Roose Bolton in Harrenhal, there are no more big players cut out from the cast. The Northern forces are diminishing even though Robb hasn't lost a single battle.

* I would like to discuss the military matters, but we're nearing the point where bringing up the differences means playing dangerously close to spoilers. So sorry, no comments on Robb's plans till the plot wraps up.

**Creepy Beyond Measure**

&gt; ""Ser Davos is a traitor. Best forget him"" - Stannis, almost winning the Worst Father of the Episode award

* Meet Selyse Baratheon, who has just re-defined the maximum level of creepiness for this show. You could imagine why Stannis doesn't really rely on her. Sometimes those set up marriages go horribly wrong.

* Selyse and Shireen are actually in the picture right from the beginning of *A Clash of Kings*, their appereance just got pushed away to the double-season book events. Those scenes could be called being out of the blue (especially the stillborns in jars, pure WTF moment) but they fit Selyse's devout craziness and Stannis's anxiety. He's scared of Melissandre and Selyse. They creep him out just as they do us.

* Book Stannis seems unaware of his involvement in the shadow baby business. This one is a really long story to cover, though, as there are *two* shadow assassins in the book and we see only one being born. That's a long one, I told you.

* You might consider this a spoiler, but book Stannis and even book Melissandre do not consider Davos a traitor or their enemy. Page-by-page story would require much more characters and would last quite a bit shorter. If you consider anything you see too unbelievable, it's just prolonging a part of ASOS for the two-season book split. Insert generic IT MAKES SENSE IN THE BOOKS (I didn't have to bring up this card since Jaime's early release before Catelyn got the news from Winterfell which greatly justified her motives).

* Greyscale is a disease, non-lethal form of a much more serious one, that can leave flesh stiff and dead and the skin cracked, mottled black and grey and stone-like to the touch. People who survived greyscale as children are treated as lepers even though the can't infect others anymore.

* Shireen has been combined with another background character, Patchface (named for his tatooed face). His is the song the girl sings, as he is the Dragonstone's fool. Now this fellow creeps even *Melissandre* out. He was the sole survivor of a shipwreck (which killed Steffon Baratheon, Robert's father), but his mind got broken. Some of his rhymes were quite prophetic. ""The shadows come to dance"" part goes on way before Renly dies.

* One more character whose plot Shireen gained is Pylos, the new maester who took over Cressen's (the man who got killed by his own poison he intended to use to kill Melissandre in S02E01). He was the one teaching Davos how to read. Little girl teaching an old man how to read might sound implausible, but isn't it adorable? By the way, the story from this book she took is actually in a spin-off tale wrote by GRRM, ""Dunk and Egg"".

**Just When We Hoped For Flashback**

&gt; ""You're not Lord Commander here. You're just another exile"" - Jorah Mormont, boasting himself as the better sidekick

* In case you haven't figured it out from the choice of ""previously on"", Jorah was figuring out how much ser Barristan knows about his spying.

* Reminder: Unsullied are given new names *every single day*. They literally draw random names out of a box. They don't even remember what was their name a week before. What happened here is that for the first time they *kept* their names. One of those details that can get lost on the first watching, Season 3 marathons are gonna be great.

For non-bookreaders: it's the jester at the court of Stannis and the buddy who always sticks with Selyse.
Why then is the singing of the world beneath the sea? Patchface is no Ironborn in any case. Patchface was found in one of the free cities by the father of Stannis, lor Steffon. He thought that Patchface might made Stannis laugh. However, there was no laughing at the arrival of Stannis' father back at Storms End: the whole fleet with which he travelled, was smashed against the rocks, in side of Storms End, with no survivers but one: Patchface. He was found a couple of days after the catastrophy on the beach. When he was found, he kept saying that he had dined with the mermaids under the water and that had seen the whole world there. 

Everytime, when he sees a change, he talks of one of the strange things in the world under the water of the sea:
&gt; ""Under the sea the mermen feast on starfish soup, and all the serving men are crabs, I know, I know, oh oh oh.""

Also a quote from him:
&gt; ""The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord/The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord""

So Im about 600 pages in, and its annoying me that about 100+ pages of it have been [AFFC](#b ""Brienne walking looking for Sansa, who we already know is with Littlefinger in the Eyrie"").

Really, it feels like GRRM is just padding the text with these, since not only does nothing happen, we dont really learn anything, and the suspsense is non-existant because we know exactly where the person she's looking for is, and know shes on the wrong trail. Sure, when she goes to Braavos its fun that she bumps into [AFFC](#b ""Arya""), but its so pointlessly irrelevant to what's happening that it just annoys me to read it.

So I ask you guys, do the chapters get better? Am I missing something? Is there stuff that I'm learning that is important that is just lost on me because of how bored I am when reading them? Really, help me enjoy the chapters, because right now I dread them each time they pop up.

EDIT: Sorry the title spoiler tag failed. Also, yeah it was [AFFC](#b ""Sam in Braavos"") so yeah cant think of anything interesting then. So it's essentially just filler world building then? Seems weird to devote so much of the book to something thats just descriptions of the world. Shame because the other character's chapters are significantly more interesting, which makes me think part of the reason people say this books is the most boring and pointless one is mostly due to these chapters.

Most of you know what I'm referring to, but basically as orange and blue are contrasting, but complementary, colors, it's a pretty typical go-to move for designers and producers in the entertainment business.

My only question is, do you think this was this just a production cop-out, or was this on purpose?  The episode was ""Kissed by Fire"" and the series is A Song of Ice and Fire, so the orange/blue contrast would make sense.  But typically the show has a more creative design approach.  I don't know.

He was killed in *A Clash of Kings* by Jon while he was serving under Qhorin Halfhand, whereas he's first introduced in Season 3, apparently filling the role of Varamyr Sixskins as a prominent Wildling warg and Jarl as one of the co-leaders of the crew sent to scale the Wall.

Orell clearly doesn't like Jon, who clearly doesn't like him back. This, combined with the facts that Ygritte supports Jon and Tormund tosses Orell to the ground like he's a piece of dirt, means that Orell is pretty much alone in his (accurate) suspicions of Jon. He doesn't think Jon is truly one of them, and he's probably waiting for the day that Jon dies.

In *A Storm of Swords*, Orell actually does resurface in the form of his Eagle, which he is now stuck in since Jon has killed his warg body. He hates Jon, for obvious reason, and claws his face up fairly early in the book (before they even separate from Mance, I believe). Some promotional material has shown Kit Harrington having bloody gashes on his face, meaning this event is likely to happen.

I believe that it's going to happen as Jon is scaling the Wall. The whole climb was fairly uneventful in the book (minus the part where a chunk of ice breaks off, killing Jarl and several others), so it would add a lot of dramatic tension if Orell wargs into his eagle and makes an attempt on Jon's life while he's in a very vulnerable position.

**TL;DR**: Orell's eagle attacks Jon while he's climbing the Wall.

How? I suspect littlefinger is an economic proginiy. He may have been one of the first people in westros to realize an important modern economic principle, that it is often a *good* idea to run a country at a deficit.

In other words, it is a good idea to borrow and be in debt. Why? its more complicated then this, but essentially: because large countries like 7kingdoms can borrow money cheaply (this is never mentioned in the books, but I am assuming that this is true of the seven kingdoms because its a large and fairly rich country) it makes sense to borrow money in the short term and use it to build up the economy in the long run.

I suspect littlefinger understood this. I think littlefinger is borrowing and spending money to ""breed more dragons"" (and increasing the overall incomes of the kingdoms) while simultaneously paying back the debts, and still coming out ahead. 

But I also think that this is a bit of a revolutionary idea. Most people (even rich people) would look at the crowns empty coffers and large debt and think ""holy shit holy shit we gotta stop borrowing money and stop spending so much so we can pay back all this debt"" without realizing that its the spending and the borrowing that is keeping the whole dang thing afloat, and if they abandend the economic plan little finger has set up by acting conservatively, winter and war will ensure that the crown goes bankrupt.

Ever since littlefinger left all we hear of is how despite how the income of the crown has increased a ton, that the coffers are empty and the crown is in debt. I suspect littlefinger *deliberatly created this economic situation*. knowing that anyone else but him would not see the economic advantages of the situation he has created and screw things up majorly trying to get things back to the way they where before hand.

Or I could be reading to much into it. I dont even think this will be adressed in the series, but if its true its a masterstroke.",9,25,False,self,,,,,

Now given the age of GRRM + the speed of HBO adaptation of the book (almost 3 books are done in 3 seasons), What would happen ? 

- Would HBO will completely drift off from the original plot to conclude the series ? 
- Would they take a break till GRRM finishes the series ? I am doubtful at it. The kind a twist and complex plots he introduces, I don't think that he is interested in finishing a books series which he started in 1994 (I believe)
