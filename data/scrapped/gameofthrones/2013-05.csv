While people IRL don't really get their physical features via Mandellian Genetics (the entire seed-is-strong concept) there are tons of other examples in which GRMM must have utilized a medical background.  For example, the inbreeding seen in the Targaryen family or in any family does in fact increase chances for psychological disorders.  That is sort of a well known idea; supporting the fear of marrying cousins (that plus the classical example of bleeding disorders).  Yet, there is more detail.  Daenerys is described as having silver hair and purple eyes like the rest of her family; signs of tyrosinase deficiency (albinism).  Not all albino persons are inbred but the chances of having various degrees of albinism raises.  Off the top of my head I cannot think of more examples but there are a ton.  What do you guys think?

Beric Dondarrion +10 (Season Total: +17) 
Neat trick dude. Must have sucked to play cops and robbers with him as a kid.

Thoros of Myr +9 (Season Total: +10) 
What do you mean you can't bring back people who were decapitated several months ago? Weak sauce.

The Hound +9 (Season Total: +2) 
Didn't get felled by a flaming sword. Today was a good day.

Jon Snow +8  (Season Total: +10) 
Bow-chika-wow-wow

Tywin Lannister +7  (Season Total: +18)
 Father knows best.

Olenna Redwyne +5  (Season Total: +21)
 She knows her war stuff. Made Tyrion look like a boring turd. Another win for the Queen of Thorns.

Petyr Baelish +5  (Season Total: +5)
 Littlefinger pulls off some pretty crafty sexpionage, satisfying Cersei and gaining information about Sansa. 

Blackfish Tully +5  (Season Total: +8 )
Nice punch dude!

Roose Bolton +4  (Season Total: +5)
With the Kingslayer in his possession Bolton just upped his game. 

Daenyrs Stormborn +2  (Season Total: +31)
Chillaxin after her recent awesomeness. The loyalty of the Unsullied seems to be without question if Grey Worm is any indication.

Sansa Stark +1 (Season Total: +5) 
So being the subject of everyone else's plot is probably not the best position to be in, but it is a credit to her power as the key to the North.

Jaime Lannister +1  (Season Total: -6)
 Jaime would get more points for cementing his bond with Brienne (and spending some naked time in a tub with her) but he is still a prisoner and his stump probably hurts like a sonamabitch.

Davos Seaworth -1   (Season Total: -3)
Not looking any worse for wear despite being locked in a musty dungeon. Hang in there Davos.

Tyrion Lannister -2  ( (Season Total: 0)
Getting the Tyrells to foot half the bill for the royal wedding is definitly a plus, but being forced by his dick dad to marry a child he doesn't wish to marry knocks him down.

Arya Stark -2  (Season Total:  +6)
She didn't get vengeance on the Hound and with Gendry joining the Brotherhood, Arya is starting to feel pretty lonely. 

Stannis Baratheon -2   (Season Total: -14)
Hands down the most dysfunctional family in Westeros. Say what you will about the Lannisters but at least they don't keep jars of still born babies on display in their fucking living room.

Cersei Lannister -3  (Season Total: -7)
  She thought she'd make daddy happy with news of the Tyrell plot to marry off Sansa Stark, but oh did it backfire. 

Robb Stark -8  (Season Total: -17)
 Way to blow it, again.

Rickard Karstark -20  (Season Total: -20)
 Goodnight sweet prince, we hardly knew ye.

TOP 5 THIS SEASON:

Daenyrs Stormborn: +31

Olenna Redwyne  +21

Tywin Lannister +18

Beric Dondarrion +17

Margaery Tyrell +14

Ah yes!  Patches.  I think you can take it either way.  I dont know that well see Patchface on the show, but you can take it that shes singing the song shes grown up hearing him sing. My very first version of that scene (before I turned it in) featured Patchface but it simply didnt work. It was enough to have to introduce his familyhaving a raving jester in there muddled it more than a bit.
Patchface is one of those wonderful, minor book characters that would be really fun to have in the show but would require so much exposition who knows?  I rule nothing out in the meantime, her song was meant as a little nod to him.

Give me your thoughts. *possible spoilers,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1dgrz9/best_fighters_in_modern_westeros_top_ten_give_me/,nickj27,1367385778,"During and after Robert Rebellion to book 5, who do you think are the most capable fighters in Westeros? Here's my list with brief explanations.

1. Robert Baratheon: This man was the Lebron James of Westeros. He had the perfect combination of size and power to beat anyone.

2. The Mountain: This man is literally a giant. The Red Viper got close, but no cigar. 

3. Kingslayer: His skill as one of the best swordsman is Westeros is repeated too often to ignore.  

4. Barristan the Bold: He does quite a bit of aging in the timeline I put forth, but he is also the most celebrated member of the Kingsguard in modern day Westeros. 

5. Gerold Hightower: The White Bull was in the Kingsguard when it was super badass, and he is huge. Arthur Dayne was a better knight, but I bet in one on one combat Hightower beats Dayne more often than not.

6. Arthur Dayne: Perhaps I'm on this Kingsguard reputation a bit, but his ""Sword of Morning"" came from a meteor. That's just cool. Also, he's referred to by many as a really, really good knight. 

7. Sandor Clegane: Like Robert Baratheon, but with a great sword. Or any weapon you give him, because he is basically a celebrated sellsword. He has size, skill and power, and should arguable be higher. 

8. Rhaegar Targaryen: A seriously skilled fighter, Rhaegar's best moments came from fighting for love at tourneys. At heart, he is not a true fighter in my opinion, but can simply excel anything he put his mind to. 

9. Victarion Greyjoy: The iron islands have to be represented, right? But seriously, this man is a killer. 

10. Bronn: Just because. 

Honorably mention: 
Lyn Corbray
Brienne of Tarth
Loras Tyrell (awesome, but too young; guys like Victarion and Bronn don't fight at tourneys with big wooden sticks, Loras does and that's where he receives a lot of his credit)
The Lightning Lord
Hosteen Frey
Brynden Tully
Mance Rayder
Greatjon Umber

But what if, what if Jon isn't Ned's kid, but his sister's? Raegar kidnapped Lyana, and during the time she was with him he could have easily fathered a child. If Ned found this out, he would have wanted the kid to live, because he's still Stark blood, coming from his sister. He also knew the kid would be executed if anyone ever found out the child was half Targaryen, so he took one for the team.

I wanted to say what I did not like and see what the knowledgeable Reddit community counters with in order to prove me wrong and enlighten me on things I may have missed/did'nt consider etc. Despite not liking 100% of things it is still such a complete book which hasn't ever really been done (so much stuff that isn't even really relevant). While I appreciate the stories I really do not like where we are at for the end of 5.

**Rob Stark being the biggest dumb butt ever.**

Rob's death/losing the war signals a huge turning pointing the book but when reading it is kind of annoying how dumb he is. He hates the Lannisters and knows his father was screwed yet continued to make such stupid mistakes and not listen to any ones advice. Things start off good for him when Ned dies as SO many people give their support which in essence should have guaranteed victory. Balon Greyjoy may very well have sided with the North (if only temporarily) had he not sent Theon, instead he could have gone himself (or sent someone) and said we will give you Theon back and you can help us get back at these people who you hate too. Of course then he blows off Walder Frey being the big idiot, he just HAS to get married can't just bone her or have her hang around until after the war. Let's his mom being an idiot and not punish her then kill Rickord (I think thats who the Karstark lord is) losing the other good portion of his army. I am okay with being naive but by this point its like, come on does he have to be such an idiot?

**Having Aegon Alive**

As soon as this happened in the book I was super annoyed. We are so far in now with the books and you decide to drop this new king in? Considering we have only 2 books left now (hopefully) this just adds more nonsense IMO to the story. Aegon will either A)Rule the throne with Daenarys B) Rule it by himself or C) Die. Are any of those REALLY that necessary? There was already so many great potential endings and you just throw in this random guy that totally undermines Daenarys and all shes been doing?

**Basically how all of Dorne has been handled**

When they introduced the Martell's halfway through season 3 I thought this was the change I was expecting. Some new characters with history that are here to make a difference, EH WRONG. Oberyn is there first and he is an amazing bad ass being my favorite character. When he mentioned helping Myrcella become queen I was so excited for the twist then he dies...for really no reason other than he fulfilled his purpose of killing Gregor and now we can't be bothered to write any more material for him.

Then we have Quentyn, talk talk talk about our awesome plan, sail all the way east to where you think maybe he will marry Daenarays and the Martell's will help her become Queen (or atleast get back to Westeros) then nope, he gets killed by a dragon basically making his whole role pointless.

This one may have an answer but why did they stay out of the war at the beginning when they don't like the Lannisters? They could have sided with Stannis, claimed their own dependance, or helped Robb.

**White Walkers**

GRRM has said we will see them more in book 6, however we are 5 books in there really haven't done anything yet. This is supposed to be some massive ice zombie army coming to destroy the entire continent and has barely been a part of it. Book 6 seems to be really focused on them so we will see, however I am just really sick of this ""winter is coming"" for 5 books. If they don't get past the wall, hasn't their whole thing been a waste? Also what's taking so long? Rangers/Wildings were north then walked to the wall shouldn't they be there?

**All the Iron Island Nonsense**

After not being featured at all we have to trade characters we know for the Iron Island drama, sorry but I don't give a crap who their new king is going to be. Euron is king conquering random islands for now and his horn will surely come into play as either he blows it and we get a super cool Kraken battle (not sure what it can do on land, so kinda pointless for an army) or the horn kills him. Victarion is off to wed Daenary's which first he will mostly likely help her win the Mereen battle (shes obv not just going to die randomly in Merren by losing a battle) and that will either A)Get her to marry him/go back to Westeros on his ships which she needs or of course B) get him killed.

**Arya**

Lots of people like her but her storyline has been one of the worst written and needs major help in 2 books. First, her 3 wishes were total BULL. This girls has a LIST of people she wants DEAD and a genie assassin comes to KILL people for her and she wastes all 3. She goes on and on about killing Joffrey and gets the chance and does not use one of them. Sorry, not buying it all. You kill a mean servant boss over the guy that killed your Dad?

Now she has been wandering around ever since then and is becoming some assassin across the sea but for what? Let's say at the beginning of book 6 she has graduated to full on cool assassin chick and can kill anyone. Who does she kill? Joffrey is dead and Cersei is humiliated and basically out of the picture and Tywin is dead. Are we really going to have her go around kill all the random bad people in the world to get her brothers to be king? Super super lame especially with all the work it needs. However I see her coming back to Westeros with Victarion and Daenarys (if everyones making the trip why not throw her on)

**Catelyn**

The whole zombie thing is just dumb, sorry. Beric giving his life for hers was dumb as we were just getting to know this rebel group and now we have Catelyn randomly going away wiping people off the map while leaving Walder and Roose alive. While this book is of fantasy genre there has been very little actual magic/fantasy impact (dragons, some fire god spells) and this zombie mom is just unnecessary, if GRRM had plans for her she could have ""barely survived""",8,0,False,self,,,,,

Which of these do you think we'll get to see in the show?

* Arya wargs into Nymeria, and sees Catelyn's corpse float in the river.
* Beric and Thoros pick her up and resurrects her, at the cost of Beric's life.
* Some random Frey [edit] is captured by the Brotherhood, and meets their new leader, Lady Stoneheart.

I'm guessing we'll get to see the resurrection this season, for casting and cliffhanger reasons. It's obviously a great cliffhanger, a wtf, and a glimmer of hope for show viewers after the RW, which can excuse them moving it to this season.

For casting reasons this also makes sense. Beric dies, so that actor doesn't need to appear next season, and we get to see that Catelyn still ""lives"", which means she can get credits for next season, even though we might not se very much of her.

I don't think we'll see Nymeria, since the wolves have been downplayed a lot in the show.

And I don't think we'll see the hanging [edit], it just makes more sense to wait with that until next season.

If you have not finished ""A Storm of Swords"" TURN BACK NOW.. 

Last chance 


Okay I am of course talking about episode 9, that book readers might or might not know, will include the Red Wedding.  We are anticipating seeing how this will be adapted on the screen...and I'll bet we're all also waiting for the reaction from non book readers to this infamous scene, but that's where I'm kind of worried.

Episode 9, ""The Rains of Castamere"", is, like ""Baelor"", and ""Blackwater"" the ""big"" episode of the season. And while I cannot remember the promotion of ""Baelor"" (did not start watching until after the first season air), I do remember ""Blackwater"" being promoted and marketed the hell out of the episode.  Everyone knew that a big battle was coming, from promos to cast interviews, we got a lot of the episode before the episode aired.  Can they do that for episode 9 this time around?

So far nothing has been released yet, I cannot even remember a synopsis having out out there yet for it, (where we've had episode synopsises for up to episodes 308 for a while now), correct me if I'm wrong and one has been put out, I can't seem to find one.  Regardless, even if they wait until after episode 8 airs, they will still have to release one, and in such a way that it won't spoil the big shock.  But it's not the synopsis that bothers me, it's the trailers and previews I fear might give too much away.  The ""Scenes for next week"" have  tended in the past to give too much away, and in a age where fans pick apart a single frame for a trailer, even one still from the Red Wedding could spoil it for the non readers.  Hell, I know it's coming, and I don't want to see any of it before it airs. 

I will say this though episode 9 this season will have something over episode 9 last season, as in ""Blackwater"" was entirely about the battle, there were no subplots but be battle and and nothing outside of Kings Landing was shown in that episode and HBO's marketing department had to show a lot from the battle in their promotion of the episode, by lack of option, the Red Wedding option...not so much.  There are other story lines going on that they can focus on aside from the Red Wedding and not give too much away in prievews.  So if they handle it right, non book readers should be safe.

But what about raising buzz on the episode?  You can make your previews and write ups as spoiler free as possible, but you still want to draw people in to watch.  And we know that the show creators have, since the show was greenlit been anxious to get to this episode, they might want to have it marketed as to emphasize that ""This is the episode you need to watch"", ""The biggest episode of the season"", ""It's all been leading up to this""....etc. I think even that could be too much, and while that approach might not give away what is going to happen, marketing it that way will surely clue in the non reader that ""Something Big"" is going to happen in episode 9... and will raise their guards.  Most book readers I think were blindsided by the Red Wedding, it was a shocking moment, I don't think viewers can get that same experience if they are aware that, as I said, something big is coming in the episode, while they'll be shocked at the developments, the ""being blindsided"" factor that many a reader felt could be lost if the vidwer is ""preparing themselves for.....""something"""".  But you cannot also market it like a normal episode, you do want to get as many viewers in for the episode as you can, what then is the safest way to approach that?

So I ask you, how do you think HBO should promote episode 9.  What should be and should not be in write ups and/or trailers.  Should they treat it like any other episode to maximize the ""WTF factor"" for the non-reader.  Let me know what you think.

Okay, then.

They can't can't can't can't can't have her around after the red wedding, and seeing as the epilogue is the next time we see her, I think it'd be great for show watchers to genuinely think she's not coming back, aside from the last 10 seconds of S04E10.

So is it just harder/stronger/sharper than regular steel? Or am I missing something?

Cersei is never told to marry Loras. Sansa is never promised Loras either. That's because Loras is supposed to be in the kingsguard. He isn't an heir, he can't marry. 
What the show conveiniently overlooked is that there is an older Tyrell brother (can't remember his name), who is the real man in question. 

And before anyone decides to pull the 'artistes license' card, kingsguard in the SOIAF universe cannot inherit or marry. At the end of season two when the Tyrells meet Jeoffrey, Loras makes two requests; marry my sister and make me a part of your kingsguard. Both are granted.

[All](#g ""Wargs. I know it's easy to see how they are being built up, but I am thinking their importance will be tremendous in the winning of the throne. Initially I figured that Dany would choose the strongest of two other noble houses to ride her other two dragons and form a strong and unbeatable union to reclaim the throne (I was particularly excited at the prospect of a broken Bran getting to mount a dragon and in a sense become whole again!) But now, after encountering Varamyr Six-Skins as a skin changer able to control multiple beasts, I think there are quite a few candidates that will be able to possess the dragons entirely (Hopefully Bran). I also think this is how the original Targaryans first gained control of their dragons in a sense. I like the idea of it taking a very great soul to possess a great beast.

Viserion is white, meaning a person with a white sigil will ride him. At first I was thinking about the Starks, but then it hit me: Jon Snow! Snow is white, so this seems no more than logical to me.

At last: Rhaegal, who is green and bronze. The Tyrells came to mind, because while their sigil is green and gold, bronze and gold seem alike enough for me to be fitting.

In the books, the Freys abandon Robb's cause when word of his marriage gets out. I don't believe they've given any indication of this other than a vague claim by Karstark that Robb lost the war when he married ""Talisa.""

Then, in this past episode, Robb said that he was going to the Twins to get the support of ""one person with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters."" -- Walder Frey.

started with mine.

I think Dany is going to bring her dragons across the water, but where she lands will be in the North, near Eastwatch. She will go for the last remaining Baratheon brother, Stannis. The Wall is going to be melted right dead center, Castle Black.

With in unthinkable number of white walkers and wights on the other side they will pour through and invade Westeros from the Last Hearth to the Sunspear. During the fight however, Drogon sets a jet of flame at a certain person that somehow managed not to die after the end of the fifth book.

He doesn't burn, he is a Targaryen. It is confirmed his sire was not Ned Stark and he is the son of Rhaegar. Dany and he figure out while the walkers are taking over that they are related, that she is his aunt.

They decide to use the dragons, as the one way to combat the walkers as they can burn large numbers at a time.

That is what I have, what do you?

I don't pretend to be a GoT expert: I've watched S1 once, S2 twice, and am currently rockin' out on S3. No novel experience. 

Come S3 there have been a few things implied that have confused my understanding of the story's history. Hoping for you fine folks to clarify:

1.) While clearly we see them as all individual men with their own desires and responsibilities at the start of the story, I had assumed that, for at least a brief moment, Jaime, Ned, and Robert were allies. Ned and Robert were leading the rebellion against the ""Mad King"" and Ned discovers Jaime, an ""inside agent"" has killed him for the same reasons the rebellion existed in the first place... and yet Ned looks down on Jaime... why? I don't understand how aligned motives suddenly become morally disharmonious. Maybe it's because Jaime's gotten to speak longer in the story, but I had always assumed (watching the show) that at a critical moment, the Lannisters, the Starks (or Winterfell) and the Baratheons were all allies. This apparently wasn't the case... and it strikes me odd. I get that the Lannisters arrived at King's Landing first and opened the door for ""the rebels""... but I just don't see a source of the bad blood or suspicion between the families/territories (pre-pushing children out windows).

2.) Maybe I'm off here, but only in the last episode or two has the label of ""KingSlayer"" been slang for ""asshole."" From even the first episodes, the fall of the Targaryens was viewed as progress. Take Jaime, who ""is his sword hand"" and revels in violence... why is this label suddenly such an insult? Stannis makes sure to address him as such in a crow-letter... and yet is trying to do the same thing: Kill Joffrey. And let's face it: as long as Jaime was a knight, it didn't appear to matter what he was called. 

So, what is the difference? Does the nickname hurt him or not? For a guy who clearly defines himself by the violence he can dispatch, why is the nickname of ""KingSlayer"" hurtful? Especially when everyone seems to know that the King he killed was a complete asshole? 

Anyway, I know this is a very devoted Reddit and these questions might be stupid, but consider me an emerging fan trying to logically (and emotionally) understand what's going on. It's appreciated.

Episode 9, ""The Rains of Castamere"", says that Jon will face ""his harshest test yet,"" which I'm going to assume will be the Wildlings forcing him to kill the man at Queenscrown. This would tie in to a comment I read a while back made by Ciaran Hinds, saying that Mance Rayder won't reappear until the finale when Tormund, Ygritte, and the others return sans Jon, and he figures out what's happened.

This would mean that Ygritte's death won't close out Jon's story this season, as I'd assumed, so we'll be seeing a bit more of her in Season 4. At first I didn't like the thought of this, but I think it'll work. If Jon's story in 3.09 ends with him turning on the Wildlings at Queenscrown, then his scenes will end with Summer attacking, along with him taking an arrow to the leg as he takes off, his fate left unclear. 3.09 will go down as ""The one where things go to shit for the Starks."" The actor playing Pyp has been confirmed as returning this season, so maybe 3.10 will have him finding Jon at Castle Black, maybe with Edd and Grenn if they've made it back. This would save a lot of characters from having one-episode appearances this season, only to come back for bigger roles in Season 4 (Maester Aemon, Satin, and several other Watchmen).

Joining the preliminary assault on Castle Black with the main Wildling assault on the Wall will also serve to enhance Jon's role in Season 4. Jon's story has probably suffered the most in transition from page to screen, especially in regards to his ACOK story, but it's the latter half of ASOS where he really takes a starring role with the defense of the Wall. If most of his action is saved for Season 4, it'll work with making him the season's main mover and shaker (as Ned was for Season 1, Tyrion was for Season 2, and Robb is shaping up to be for Season 3). It could be argued that Tyrion is a big player in the latter half of ASOS as well, but his trial is the main focus, while he's reactionary for much of it.

I'm looking forward to Jon finally getting to be front and center plotwise, though I'm a bit bummed that it will be another year before it happens.",11,26,False,self,,,,,

I've got the basic words, I'm not using duplicates either from same episodes. It can be a mix of male and female. Obviously I know that Eeva isn't said, but maybe a mumble or a mispronounced word that you are aware of.

In a real-life situation, this is not the right thing to do and could be deadly.

It is a common misconception that you should but something in the victims mouth when they are having a tonic-clonic (a.k.a ""grand mal"") seizure to keep them from swallowing their tongue.  There is no danger of that happening, but there is danger of the victim choking to death on their own saliva or blood (from biting their tongue).

To prevent someone who is having a seizure from injuring themselves, make sure to clear the area around them so that they have room to convulse.  Make sure their head is on a soft surface (such as a pillow or a bunched-up coat).  Also, turn them on their side so that excess saliva and/or blood will drain out of their mouth instead of going down their throat &amp; choking them. 

I know its just a TV show, but people sometimes assume that the characters know what they're doing, which is not always the case.  As someone who lives with an Epilepsy sufferer, I know how important it is to know how to react when someone is having a seizure.",268,2449,False,self,,,,,

Seriously, though.  The untagged naming of Ramsay Snow/Bolton has got to stop.  It should be very obvious to book-readers watching the show, especially given the theatrics surrounding his guessing game in the latest episode, that his identity is supposed to be a secret.  We all know who he is because we have advanced knowledge from ADWD that tells us who he is, but for the purposes of the show, it's clearly supposed to be a mystery.

Now, I won't deny that HBO has been seriously dropping some hints:

* the flaying
* the horn-blowing
* that dying guard called him ""bastard""
* the resemblance of Theon's torture stand to the Bolton sigil
* the fact that Bolton mentioned he'd be sending his bastard back in Season 2

But they have not outright come out and explained who Theon's torturer is, and they most certainly have never used the name ""Ramsay.""  The actor, Iwan Rheon, is credited in official sources as playing ""Boy"" for a reason.  Could an extremely astute non-reader pick up on who he is if they pay attention to all the clues?  Maybe... but that's really not your call to make.  Let them figure it out on their own time or wait for HBO to reveal it to them.

I have been removing posts that mention his name without spoiler tags, but it is starting to get out of hand.  I tell you all this in hopes that everyone will stop spoiling this plotline for non-readers, but also so that you all will help the mods by reporting it when you see someone else doing it.  Also remember, two wrongs don't make a right -- if you see someone else posting spoilers, responding to that post with more spoilers is equally unacceptable.

**TL;DR**: Stop mentioning Ramsay by name.  His identity is meant to be a mystery.  Report any comments you see that use his name without spoiler tags.

We saw many scenes with characters performing similar actions with very different motivations.


* **Theon vs Rabbits** 


Theon's flesh was stripped away for the sheer joy of it, where earlier there was a scene depicting an argument over who was better at skinning rabbits. Two ""good guys"" were arguing about who was best at separating skin from flesh, and we actually saw the whole skinned animals without feeling too gross about it. The main difference (besides animals vs humans) is in the motivation - for the girls, it was about survival. Theon's torture is just for fun.


* **Ros vs Straw Man**


Joffrey and Arya stark are kind of monsters. Sure, they have their reasons, but they're two sides of the same death coin that keeps getting flipped around this episode. Arya's hell bent on murdering those she finds to be unjust, and Joffrey's treating murder like a sport. Just to make sure we really picked up on this, the episode had both of them shoot arrows in the exact same areas. Same ultimate intentions, but the motivations are very different.


* **Varys vs Littlefinger**


These are two smart men who are playing the game on a whole different level from many of the characters we've been introduced to. In this episode, we see again that Varys truly believes that his actions will better the realm. Littlefinger makes a big to-do about how his machinations have all been because he's a true agent of chaos. They seem to be taking on a morally ambiguous ""angel and devil on the shoulder"" arrangement, with Varys favoring order - even if it's built on lies - while Littlefinger's all about the raw power of truth and chaos.


Anyway, just some observations. Theon's tormentor reminded me of [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cghg-QyTP_M) from the movie Rubber where they discuss motivation. LF and V's verbal parrying at the end made me think about it further. Was there anything that I missed?",130,623,False,self,,,,,

And in the blue the corner, from Highgarden by-way of The Arbor, donned in a green shawl with turquoise and aqua trim, the quick witted, sharp tongued Matriarch of House Tyrell and House Redwyne. She grows strong because fire and ice IS her song, the Queen of Thrones herself, OOOOOooolenna, TYREEEEELLLLLLlllll....

Each side feeling each other out in the early rounds. Little restraint shown by both parties. Both seem tentative since both sides are well equipped with proverbial aces up their sleeves. Tywin trying to soften up Olenna's defense with booze, but is easily blocked. Fearless exchanges of words. Mid-fight and gloves have truly come off. Tywin lands a clean queer-combination. A uh, a fairy-flurry if you will. BUT IT'S COUNTERED by Margaery's granny with an incest-haymaker!! Tywin is visibly shaken from the assault, he's backed against the ropes AAAND- saved by the bell. Definitely a House Tyrell round.

The bell sounds and Tywin seems a bit more cautious out there in the closing rounds, though his face and timbre of his voice do not show it. On and off the battlefield Tywin shows extraordinary grit with both sword and tongue, the latter being extremely evident behind his desk. They exchange some more but Tywin unleashes his strongest punch in his arsenal: The pen. With the law under his fingertips, what he says goes. Olenna seemed to win the war of wit, but ultimately Tywin seems to be the victor. Close bout but this will end up going to scorecards. CompuBox numbers had the match pretty much even until the closing rounds. Let's see what the judges have to say....

So what was the ""Varys vs Baelish"" scene about, I did not understand it fully. I understood that there was tension between the two characters and dramatic music was filling the background so it had to be important. I heard something about Lord Baelish talking about a certain lie they forced themselves to believe in, and something about the realm and how it does not exist; but instead it works more like a ladder of chaos (????). Did I get those parts right?

Since then, she has been seen multiple times staring at the boats coming and going, dreaming of the day when Baelish gets her out of there on his boat.

But then the whole thing came up about her marrying Loras, which she was excited about and no longer seemed to care about leaving with Baelish at all, since she knew she would be free to leave after Margery was queen.

And now, Tyrion has given her news that she is to wed him.  At the end of the episode it shows her crying as she stares at what I can assume in Peter Baelish's ship leaving port.

So, when I see this scene, it looks like she is looking to this ship thinking ""I should be on that ship, leaving"".  Why is this?  I would have thought she didn't care about leaving with Baelish anymore and at this point would be crying somewhere else, thinking ""I should be marrying Ser Loras"".

it says theres a maid with honey in her hair. i understand that ppl dont interpret this as the hair on her head, but as far as i can tell, you have no reason not to. the bear smells the honey, and tries to dance with her, and she protests, then he lifts her up to dance, she kicks and wails, as someone is wont to do when a bear grabs them, and he licks the honey from her hair.

i dont get the double entendre. someone wrote about how the bear ""licks the girl from here to there"" and if that was the case i could certainly see the dirtiness of the poem, but that line doesnt even exist in the song! so where do people get this meaning from, is there some context it's spoken of in the books i'm not aware of?

Randyll Tarly is one of the main bannermen of House Tyrell (much like Rickard Karstark and Roose Bolton to House Stark) and he has an impressive history. During Robert's Rebellion, Randyll Tarly defeated the Baratheon forces and sent future king Robert fleeing north to Riverrun. It was Randyll Tarly's liege lord Mace Tyrell who laid siege to Storm's End for a year, forcing Stannis to eat cats and horses until the Onion Knight came.

* Since this scene did not bring up much and merely refreshed our memory of the characters, here's another reminder: back in S02E08 Sam found a pack of blades made of ""dragonglass"", as he calls it. The obsidian package has been wrapped in a Night's Watch cloak. Whose - that is unknown, it could have been Qohorin Halfhand, Benjen Stark (most popular theory) or someone else.

**Rabbitskinning Catfight**

&gt; ""I want you both to make peace"" - Bran, trying really hard to not tell what he really wants them to do

* I expanded this to a full section just to make this joke. Sorry, nothing new this week.

* Oh, as someone pointed out: in the event of an epileptic shock do not, I repeat do NOT use any kind of material to block one's mouth. Laying the person on their back instead of their side is a bad idea as well.

* And for the people who are new to my followups, once again: What Jojen does goes uder the term *green dreams*, later you'll hear ""greenseeing"". This is *not* warging, which is what Orell and Bran do (wolf dreams), but Brandon seems to have a talent towards greenseeing (three-eyed crow dreams) as well.

**The Literal Climb**

&gt; ""Am yo woman now, Jun Sno. You're going to be loyal to your woman"" - Ygritte, vaginazoning poor Jon into corner

* ""The Wall defends itself"".

* Regarding Ygritte: the words she said bare more meaning as wildling customs treat Jon and Ygritte as pretty much what south of the Wall would be a married couple. By taking Ygritte a prisoner, Jon fullfilled the ritual of kidnapping the woman from her tribe.

* As you've heard in the last episode, only three outposts along the Wall are manned. Night's Watch isn't what it used to be and that's why they let the trees grow so close to the Wall.

**Robin Hood: Stealing From Rich And Selling The Poor**

&gt; ""You should not have this power"" - Melissandre, for the very first time being jealous of mopjo she does not possess

* Anguy the archer won the archery contest at the Hand's Tournament back in season 1. 20 000 golden dragons... I wonder what he did with the money.

* Here comes the part that makes book readers *really* interested: the Melissandre-Thoros confrontation did not happen in the books. This is where TV shows more than the books. First, we hear the Red Priests speaking High Valyrian (both are from the East, where it's the language of the elites); second, Gendry gets a storyline (this is where he would've gotten Hot Pie'd); third and the most important thing is Mel learning about the Kiss of Life. Man, this is getting *intense*.

* I think the most impactful thing the books did not deliver is Red Priests using ""Valar morghulis"" as a greeting. So far it used to be associated with Faceless Men (Jaquen H'gar) more than the priests of R'hllor.

* Book Brotherhood was way much less ""we serve the Lord of Light"". This is me playing the weekly ""It made sense in the books"" card, but you could say that making the Brotherhood sell Gendry out is adding some depth to the group.

* Melissandre seeing Arya's future broke my favourite conspiracy theory (it's so crazy it doesn't really need the tagging): [ASOS](#b ""that Faceless Men and Red Priests are the titular forces of Ice and Fire, fighting ancient battle to destroy/save the world."")

**Krakenflaying Hornblower**

&gt; ""If you think this has a happpy ending, you haven't been paying attention""

* The whole Theon story is a mystery. If you have some spare time, rewatch the ending of Season 2 (scenes regarding Winterfell). Noticing certain things helps as well. This one is a riddle you can solve on your own :)

**Edmure Is An Idiot**

&gt; ""...what."" - Edmure, being a Tully

* Walder Frey has been disgraced many times. All the major houses look down at him because of many reasons, one of which was his late arrival at the battle of Trident (he supported Robert when it was already over), giving him the nickname of ""The Late Lord Frey"". For his family to become a greater house is all he wants.

* The Freys are bannermen to Tullys, but after Robb married and broke his vow they withdrew all their army. Robb is trying to win it back.

* Harrenhal: currently held by lord Roose Bolton, entitled to Petyr Baelish by the South (assuming the Riverlands surrender) and just promised to Walder Frey and his numerous offspring by the North.

* Edmure seems outraged by having his marriage arranged while Sansa has absolutely nothing to say: that is because the rights to girl's hand belong to her father and Sansa's took over to the crown.

**Dinner for Five Hands**

&gt; ""I would've hoped you had learned your lesson about overplaying your... position"" - Roose Bolton, reminding that handchopping is still on the menu

* What you see here is Roose Bolton trying to save the situation, really. Think of what impact it would make if this matter didn't get sorted out. Right now people don't really believe in the image of Robb the Lannisters are trying to show them (turning into a wolf and eating children). However such a dishonourable act as chopping the hand of the finest knight in Seven Kingdoms marks Robb as a barbarian, not much better than the wildlings from beyond the Wall.

* Roose Bolton is trying to break the chain of responsilibity from Locke to Robb, and, what's even more important for his sake, he doesn't want Lannisters to be hunting house Bolton. It wouldn't be hard for the Lannisters to send some forces to deal with Roose at Harrenhal, which is already in ruin, if they decided it's worth the effort.

**Best Grandparents Ever**

&gt; ""I feel like I'm in a dream"" - Sansa Stark, even more oblivious than usual

* So come again, the net isn't *that* tight: book provides more members of the Tyrell family that hang around, making the story and attempted engagements a little bit less crazy. Story-wise this shortcut is better.

* About ""everyone knows this"", reminder from S02E01: Stannis sent ravens to all greater and smaller lords of Westeros with the news of Joffrey's true parentage; the news spread to the smallfolk, but Lannisters striked back with a rumour that Shireen isn't Stannis's daughter, but his halfwit fool's (the fool got written out, his are the creepy songs). It's not what people believe in that matters: it's what they choose to *say* they believe in that does.

* You can't really force someone into Kingsguard, but it's treated as the highest of honors for a knight and refusing to take it without a good reason to do so would raise massive speculation.

* Ros was a show-only person solely for some of the characters to have an opportunity to speak their mind in a brothel. She also took a small part of another prostitute, Alayaya, who helped Tyrion to move between his chambers and the place he held Shae in.

That's all, folks! Any commentary is more than welcome.

Personally I'm glad how this season is working out so far. The book split (ASOS will be covered in two seasons) made many events span long enough to explain most of the details to the viewers.",491,614,False,self,,,,,

A lot of people have been wondering when Loras is going to join the Kingsguard, and when Tywin brought it up this episode I thought, here we go.  However, they made a point of the fact that Loras in the sole heir to Highgarden, and that should he be named to the Kingsguard, the house of Tyrell is ended.  It seems to me that rather than forshadowing, this was another case of 'nod to the readers so they accept the changes to come'.

They are no longer enemies, at least at the moment. Even when Tyrion brings up the attempt on his life, Cersei (regardless of whether or not she truly did set up the attack) actually gives him a somewhat decent response.

Tyrion: ""I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.""

Cersei: ""Probably, but not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now that father's here.""

She even admits that Tyrion's wildfire move saved everyone's lives.
""If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gates.""

And Tyrion seems to try to comfort Cersei by pointing out that when Jaime gets back he might kill Loras and free Cersei.

They even seem to be united in their pity for Sansa -

Cersei: ""Who's going to tell her?""

Another episode means another ""adding 

Before the outset a word on the spoiler scope of this thread.  Most of this post deals with plot points from A Clash With Kings, or book 2, and talk on book-to-show differences. This means that some names, and minor plot points that have not yet come up on the show could appear here, and could be considered minor spoilers if the show should get to the topic, that being said this does come from ACOK, so any spoiler would be very minor to the non reader.  Per suggestion, I re-labeled this under ""ASOS"" for book spoiler scope, but nothing past where we are in the show will be discussed here that hasn't come up in the show (aside from the aforementioned ACOK details.  That being said let's get to the topic,

You may have read this yesterday, the original thread got removed for not entirely being correctly labeled, understandable, but issues are fixed and this is the re-post.

On this weeks episode we saw Tywin Lannister threaten the Queen of Thorns with robbing the Tyrells of the heir to Highgarden, by naming Lora's to the Kingsguard if she refused to marry Loras to Cersei, as lady Olenna still refused the betrothal and we know how Tywin is with his word, we can assume that in the coming episodes we will see the young Tyrell given a white cloak..but who are the remaining Kingsguard members?  The show thus far only has 2 named members... Jaime Lannister as Lord Commander, and Meryn Trant, and two known vacancies with the death of Ser Mandon Moore, and the desertion of Sandor Clegane... and while we have seen the others, they have yet to be named, so for the sake of the non reader I am here to help sort out who's who in Joffrey's current Kingsguard, and as an added bonus I'll post a few facts about the historical order that non readers might not be aware of.

So before we can name the current Kingsguard, let's start out with who made up the order at the start of ACOK, and possibly at the start of season 2.... Your seven are..

1. Jaime Lannister (Lord Commander)
2. Meryn Trant
3. Boros Blount
4. Arys Oakheart 
5. Preston Greenfield
6. Mandon Moore
7. Sandor Clegane

That's the lineup at the start of book two, but how far can we extrapolate this into the show?  Let's start with Preston Greenfield.. While we did see the riot in Kings Landing last season what we did not see was the death of KG member Ser Preston, after his death in the riot he was replaced my a knight named Balon Swann. For the sake of simplicity, and should he ever be named on the show it would be easier to say Swann was always a member and there was never a Ser Preston in show-canon. So there is one of your blanks.  

There was also a minor sub-plot in ACOK where Boros Blount was dismissed from his post for surrendering Prince Tommen to Tyrion's men when was sent away from the city prior to the battle of Blackwater Bay.  He was replaced by a man named Osmund Kettleblack in the book.  Blout was later reinstated (by Tywin iirc) as a replacement for Sandor Clegane after he deserted his post.  As this whole subplot was dropped from the show, I think we can assume that Blount had a solid uninteruppted stint in the KG, and holds the post still at this point within the show, but what does that mean for Osmund Kettleblack.  Can we assume that he replaced Sandor on the show and was named to the KG off-screen?  Or is he yet to show up?  Once again for the sake of simplicity I'm inclined to go with the former, but we shall see.

Lastly we get to what last night's episode touched on.  Who shall fill the vacancy left by the death of Ser Mandon Moore?  In the show it is all but confirmed that it will be Loras Tyrell per Tywin's threat, in the book Loras was outright named to the Kingsguard in the aftermath of the Blackwater (at the same time Margery is betrothed it Joffrey), and IIRC was requested by Loras to be so.  Loras in the books is not the heir to Highgarden, as he is the youngest of three sons of Lord Mace Tyrell, thus the threat of ""losing their heir"" via Tywin's threat was not in the book.  I like the way the show has handled the Loras/Kingsguard plot and not immediatly naming him to the KG last season has really helped the Sansa marriage subplot as well, but I'm glad the show is getting Loras to where he was in the books...

So given all of that I present what we can assume is the current in-show Kingsguard lineup....and one that matches the books...

1. Jaime Lannister - Lord Commander- Currently prisoner at Harrenhall
2. Meryn Trant
3. Boros Blount
4. Arys Oakheart - FYI, was sent to Dorne with Marcyella as her protector.
5. Balon Swann
6. Osmund Kettleblack?????? - I'm guessing when, and if he shows up he'll already be on the KG, but not 100%
7. Loras Tyrell - has to be ""officially"" named

So there you have it, a who's who of the Kingsguard currently in the show, admittily this is speculative, but this is the lineup in the books at this point...hope you found it interesting.  

And now a few fun facts about the Kingsguard

1. Did you know, Maester Aemon was named after his great uncle Aemon ""The Dragon Knight"" Targaryen.  Who was lord commander of the Kingsguard under King Aegon IV, aka ""Aegon the Unworthy""

2. While we have seen appointments to the Kingsguard made by other characters (in the show and in the books), only the King can choose his Lord Commander.

3. This has not been mentioned in the show, but is on the viewers guide in the HBO site, so it's pretty safe, but ill still hide this behind a tag...[ASOS](#b ""Of the many responsibilities of The Lord Commander, one is the keeping and updating of the White Book, or Book of Brothers.  Where each member who has ever been in the Kingsguard has their deeds noted. "")

4. If a member of the royal family is a party in a trial (accuser or accused) and the accused demands a trial by combat, the member of the royal family must choose a member of the Kingsguard to act as his/her champion in the trial by combat if they choose to elect a champion (if not they themselves must fight).

5. Other claimants to the throne keep Kingsguards as well, Danerys has in the books a ""Queensguard"" that at the start of ASOS consists of Jorah Mormont, and her three Dothraki bloodriders Rakharo, Jhogo, and Aggo.  In the show Rakharo was killed in the second season. I assume Jhogo, and Aggo remain (one of them was with Jorah and Dany at the house of the undying on the show iirc).

Renly also kept a Kingsguard (known as the Rainbow Guard in ACOK) that consisted of Loras Tyrell as Lord Commander, Brienne of Tarth, Emmon Cuy, Robar Royce, Bryce Caron, Guyard Morrigen, and Parmen Crane. (Thank you wiki of ice and fire).  The group disbanded after King Renly's death. Royce and Cuy were killed by Loras immediatly after Renly's death, Brienne joined service of Catlyn Stark, and the others joned Stannis' forces and were either killed or captured in the battle of Blackwater.

6. Neither King Stannis, King (in the North) Robb Stark, nor King Balon Greyjoy have named or established a Kingsguard.  While the Kingsguard is routed in the faith of the seven (why there are seven members) this explains why none of them have established such an order under their rule as followers of the Red god, the old gods, and the drowned god respectively.  Though both Stannis and Robb do have roots with the faith of the seven.

7. It's worth note past members of the Kingsguard have played in the wars of Westeros since the order was established by Aegon the Conqueror.  I mentioned in the ""adding context"" thread a couple of weeks ago that it was the then Lord Commander Ser Christon Cole who crowned Aegon II over his sister and supposed to be heir Ranherya Targaryen which led to the civil war known as ""The Dance of The Dragons"" 200 years before the start of AGOT, but did you also know that The Lord Commander under King Aegon IV Aemon ""The Dragonknight""  who I mentioned earlier, might have been the route cause of the first Blackfyre rebellion, another civil war that happend 100 years after the Dance of the Dragons.  Aegon IV was a drunk, fat and lecherous king with numerous bastards. (Sound familiar?) who's most infamous deed as king was legitimizing all of his bastards on his deathbed, and giving the family Valaryian steel sword ""Blackfyre"" to his eldest bastard ""Daemon"".  It had long been known that King Aegon IV was in a loveless marriage and long rumored that the queen (Aegon's sister-wife) and their other brother Aemon the Dragonknight had an affair (sound familiar?) and the heir to the throne Daeron II and king after Aegon IV was himself a bastard of Aemon ""the Dragonknight"" (sound familiar?).  The rumors of which led to someone else, Daemon, claiming the throne which led to a violent and bloody war (Sound familiar?)  The Blackfyre rebellion(s) is a whole topic onto itself that I'll leave for another day, this was just to demonstrate the huge part a member of the Kingsguard played in starting a huge war.

Barristain Selmy, who was young at the time though prior to joining the Kingsguard, was key in putting an end to the Blackfyres one and for all.  Over the next few decades the Blackfyres (descendants of Daemon Blackfyre) tried a few more times for the throne to no avail, the last of which was part of the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Without going into too much detail, it ended with Selmy slaying Maelys the Monstrous, the last of the ""Blackfyre pretenders"". This time a KG ended a conflict rather than starting or being the cause one.

Barristain Selmy, now officially KG,also was key in ending a conflict the crown had with a Rebel Lord who took the Mad King hostage for 6 months, and threatened to kill the king should any attempt to rescue him occur.  Selmy stealthy entered the city, Duskendale, and rescued the King.  While war from a realm wide issue, the part the Kingsguard played in the ""Defiance of Duskendale"" is certainly worth note.


So that's it.  Who's who in the Kingsguard and a few interesting tidbits about the elite order. Sorry if I was a bit long winded, but I hoped you enjoyed it, and if you want to share a few interesting tidbits about the Kingsguard, please do so in the comments. (Feel free to go beyond the spoiler scope of the thread as well, as long as it's properly hidden).  And until next week.... Have a good one..",9,13,False,self,,,,,

I'm sure everyone here has thought at one time or another that 'godDAMN I could use two extra hours of GoT in my life!'. Personally I found the second series' adaptation of Clash of Kings could have benefited from two extra hours, to give extra screentime and character/story development to a number of characters.

I feel each series of Game of Thrones should be 12 episodes long, first and foremost from a creative standpoint. The head writers have stated that they've had to make a 'Sophie's Choice' when it comes to certain bits from the books, as there's simply not enough room in the 10-hour season for the complete immersive world of the source material. 2 extra episodes per season could accommodate substantially more intricate world-building and character development. 

Then on a more selfish note, I would just love two extra hours per year to simply watch the f*ck out of Game of Thrones. I'm sure we are all agreed that every scene just glues your eyes to the screen, and who wouldn't want more of that?

My question to you all is, could/should we start a petition to try and get HBO to drop more money into it? And if we decide to do this, what's the best way to go about it? I'm sure the loyal GoT viewers will stay onboard for an extra two weeks everytime a new series comes around - the viewing numbers would support the decision. 

What do you all think?

If they intend to leave him as GRRM does in the books, why did we need so many of these scenes? If they are coming back to him now and again so that viewers don't forget about him, again, why so many scenes?

Can you even imagine how horrible GOT would have been if they had cut the seasons into 2-3 hour long films? Surely the higher-ups in the movie/TV industry must have opened their eyes by now? GOT is arguably going to go down as one of the best TV series ever, and alot of the credit has to go to the script/pacing.

10- Whenever youre around a fire, you wind up staring intently into the flames trying to see the future.
 
9- You decide to name your favorite eraser Wordsbane.
 
8- Instead of saying Thats right, you find yourself saying Just so.
 
7- Instead of saying Hes right, you find yourself saying It is known.
 
6a- You start calling Mom and Dad my lady mother and my lord father.
 
6b- You begin referring to your wife as khaleesi
 
5- All knives seem dull because, after all, they are no Valyrian steel.
 
4- The phrase Tyroshi sellsword begins rolling around your head like a bad 80s pop song.
 
3- You stop trusting anyone, start going by a pseudonym, and begin making plans for revenge that involve deceit, betrayal, and a painful, violent end.
 
2- You begin cursing George R.R. Martins name because youre going to have to wait another five years and hes probably going to pull a Jordan anyway.

I'm barely into a AGoT and have already made an interesting connection between Jon's description of an unconscious Bran with Bran's description of the three-eyed crow in ADwD.


From AGoT Jon II, ""This was not the Bran he remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open but they saw nothing. The fall had shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave. Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath"".


Bran's description of the three-eyed crow in ADwD, ""His body was so skeletal and his clothes so rotted that at first Bran took him for another corpse, a dead man propped up so long that the roots had grown over him, under him, and through him....A little skin remained, stretched across his face, tight and hard as white leather, but even that was fraying, and here and there the brown and yellow bone beneath was poking through.....The only thing that looked alive in the pale ruin of a face was his one red eye, burning like the last coal in a dead fire, surrounded by the twisted roots and tatters of leathery white skin hanging off a yellowed skull"" (Bran II, III).

I almost made an eight in my pants after reading it knowing Bran's possible/pretty-sure-it's-gonna happen fate. So thanks to all you weirdos who convinced me to go back and appreciate this kind of stuff.

But my vote really has to go to Thoros of Myr. Paul Kaye has really given an interesting life to a character who really seemed a bit bland in the books to me. He has a lot of layers to his character, and his monologue in this last episode really showed the depth of who Thoros is.

About 3 to 3.5 thousand are men from the northern mountain clans and about 500-1000 are Northerners loyal to Mormont, Glover, and Umber with some treacherous Karstarks mixed in. Roose Bolton is in Winterfell with (presumably) about 7 thousand men (3k loyal to Bolton, Ryswell, and Dustin; 2k loyal to Manderly; and 2k loyal to Frey).


Bolton sends out the 2k Frey men and 2k Manderly men out different gates to fight Stannis in order to ease tensions in the castle since the Freys and Manderlys hate each other. It's unclear whether Bolton knows that Stannis now has the 3k mountain clan men. However, Bolton, being very cautious, still has his 3k men in Winterfell, easily enough to hold the castle against even an enormous army. There were supposed to have been five Freys in the north but 3 have disappeared (presumably murdered by White Harbor men). Therefore, it is up to Aenys and Hosteen Frey to lead their two thousand men against Stannis.


However, in Theon's sample chapter from Winds of Winter, readers find out that Mors Umber had been digging pits outside of Winterfell's gates (unnoticed because of the blizzard) and blowing horns and beating drums to draw out Bolton. Aenys Frey falls into one of these pits and breaks his neck. Therefore, it is up to Hosteen Frey to lead the army. Hosteen is the best fighter among the Freys but Stannis claims he's a fool, calling him ""Ser Stupid."" We also know from this sample chapter that Stannis has found out about Arnolf Karstark's plan to betray him for Roose Bolton. These men will all be killed (as Stannis explicitly states), probably burned for Rhollor to bring them success in the imminent battle.


Meanwhile, at the end of ADWD, Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton saying that Stannis died in 7 days of battle and that Ramsay has captured Mance Rayder. However, Ramsay demands Theon and ""Arya"" back (Stannis said he was going to send them North to the wall to Jon) and says if Jon does not send them back he will attack Castle Black. We know that Mance and his spearwives were captured in ADWD when Theon was escaping so we know Ramsay is telling the truth about this. We should presume he (thinks he) is telling the truth about Stannis as well. Here's how I think the battle goes down: Hosteen rushes stupidly to attack Stannis' forces, thinking they are smaller than they actually are. Meanwhile, Manderly sends a messenger ahead to Stannis talking about his deal with Davos to return Rickon in exchange for Manderly's support. I think he will prove Davos is alive by showing a letter from Davos signed and stamped with the hand's seal. Since Stannis' squire is Davos' son, he can verify that this is Davos' handwriting and, therefore, Stannis will believe he is alive and well and agree to ally himself with Manderly. Hosteen attacks Stannis and they battle for a while, before Manderly comes along and takes Hosteen Frey's forces from the rear, pretty much destroying them and killing or capturing Hosteen.


Now Manderly and Stannis' forces combined make 7 or 8 thousand but they still cannot hope to take a heavily garrisoned and heavily provisioned Winterfell. Therefore, Manderly proposes to dress some of his and Stannis' men in Frey clothes so that Manderly could get back into Winterfell with what Bolton thinks is the remainder of the Manderly and the Frey forces. Manderly will say that Hosteen was killed and that leaves nobody to verify that these aren't Frey men and actually Stannis' men (since now all of the Freys sent north are dead or in Stannis' captivity). He will present Bolton with Stannis' sword and crown to prove he killed him. However, he says that he could not find Theon and ""Arya"" (who had escaped earlier) and that after questioning one of Stannis' men found out they were sent North to Jon Snow at the wall. This will infuriate Ramsay, prompting him to send the Bastard letter demanding these two back.


Jon will refuse to do this and, after being brought to life by Melisandre and freed from his NW vows, he will assemble an army of wildlings to try to stop Bolton. This is hopeless, considering Bolton's force is mounted and highly disciplined and Castle Black has no walls to the South. Bolton's forces will move north led by either Ramsay or Roose (probably Ramsay since Roose is cautious and will stay in Winterfell). As they are about to break Jon's forces and annihilate the Night's Watch, Stannis forces will come from the rear and destroy them. Stannis had been hiding in the Wolfswood so Bolton didn't discover the trick. Jon and Stannis' armies will annihilate the Boltons and kill or capture Roose and/or Ramsay. Either way, whoever is left will not have enough men to hold Winterfell and Stannis will win it back. Stannis will cement his hold on the North and earn their loyalty by killing the Boltons.


By this time, the Golden Company will have taken Storm's End (we known this from Arianne's sample chapter from Winds of Wind). We also know from this chapter that Mace Tyrell and his Reach army is heading towards Storm's End to stop them. The rest of the Reach's army will be battling the Ironborn in the Reach after Euron invaded there. Moreover, most of the Westerland forces will be in the Riverlands trying to maintain control there. This leaves King's Landing ripe for the taking.


Patchface has a prophecy: ""We will march into the sea and out again. Under the waves we will ride seahorses, and mermaids will blow seashells to announce our coming."" The Mermaids are the sigil of House Manderly who just joined Stannis. The Seahorse is the sigil of House Velaryon of Driftmark (an island near Dragonstone). The Velaryon's are loyal to Dragonstone (Stannis) and the Bastard of Driftmark, Aurane Waters, has just taken the Royal Fleet out to sea after Cersei's arrest. Aurane Waters will sail Stannis' army to King's Landing to take the Iron Throne. Stannis' army will be even larger because he sent Justin Massey to Braavos to take out a loan with the Iron Bank for an army of at least 20k strong (this is discussed in ADWD). I believe Stannis will take the Iron Throne but I don't know what will happen after that."")",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Their theory was kind of astounding and amazing and even if it isn't true, Holy Moly...

Could Cersei be Gendry's mother??? In Season 1, Cersei goes on and on about her black haired baby boy that died when he was young. Later on that season, Gendry says that his mother had blonde hair and died when he was a baby.

WHAT IF... Varys took the kid and hid him away? He wouldn't actually be a bastard, and he would actually have the best claim of anyone in the known world.

Book readers, I beg you... find some evidence for this theory, or shut me down, but can we agree that the consequences of this would be utterly mind blowing if it were true?

If there anything else we can do, as people who come to this subreddit a lot, to counter people like this? As I'm sure most, if not all of us, would prefer the people who only watch the show to not see any spoilers.

While it was clearly well done, and seemed like something I SHOULD enjoy, it wasn't holding my attention. I'm not sure why. Recently, I started the first book. I am enjoying it so far, and I look forward to delving deeper into the world. This makes me think I should give the TV series another try.

I thought it would be interesting to read the book series alongside the TV series. I would read the first book, then watch the first season, then read the second book, then watch the second season and so on. But, I'm unsure how much of the books the TV series covers.

Does the first season only cover the first book, or is there some overlap into the second? The Wikipedia page for the first season says ""The cable television series closely follows the multiple story lines of the A Song of Ice and Fire novel series"" but doesn't say ""The cable television series closely follows the multiple story lines of the Game of Thrones novel.""

If I were to read and watch in the manner I described, how much of the books should I read before watching the show?

Still with me? Then, when a finger/toe is placed between the 2 blades the knife is twisted from 90 degrees to 360 degrees loosening the skin. Finally, you grab the loose, freshly flayed, skin and basically turn it inside out as you rip it off the finger.

I noticed a detail that I now think might become very important later on in the series: Drogon is red and black, and so is the Targaryen sigil, the sigil of Daenerys Stormborn. Since the sigil of his rider matches his colors, might that mean that the other dragons will be ridden by someone who has a sigil matching to their colors as well?

With Viserion we can pretty much go anywhere. He is white, which leaves a lot of options open. As most people believe, I myself think that Jon Snow might be possible. His ""sigil"" is snow, so there is definitely a possibility there. But we could also get Ramsay (He is officially a Bolton, but everyone knows he's a Snow.) or a wildling, wich I think might get pretty interesting.

Now for Rhaegal. I know that this is a bit tinfoily, but I'm thinking a Tyrell. Rhaegal is green with bronze, while the Tyrell sigil is green with gold. I myself believe that these two are similar enough to be possibilities, or perhaps there will be a slight change in colors on Rhaegals behalf. If I have to guess, I think that Margaery will ride Rhaegal, while Loras is my second choice. Why Margaery? I think that we might get a parallel with the landing of Aegon the Conqueror, who had one man and two women riding the dragons. Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Margaery Tyrell are my guesses because of this. Besides, who wouldn't love to see Margaery ride a dragon?

I know this is a tinfoil theory, and I'd love to see some of your additions or opinions on this matter!",27,0,False,self,,,,,

After she has freed Roose Bolton and his men why does she not reveal herself? I can understand that immediately after they are freed she might be shocked or uncertain whether she can trust him. But she obviously knows that he is a bannerman to her brother. She could have just said something later on when she serves Bolton. Even if he might not believe her at first, she certainly has some ""insider-knowledge"" from Winterfell or the north that only a Stark could know and which could convince him to send her to Riverrun to see if she speaks the truth when they bring her to Catelyn. Arya seems smart enough to realize that Bolton would take that chance because if he actually returns the lost daughter to the Starks, he would be handsomely rewarded.

I understand that the Boltons have a somehow bad and harsh reputation but does Arya actually believe that a Lord from the North would take advantage of this situation, for example by blackmailing the Starks? Otherwise I have no explanation for her behavior. 

By the way: I'm not a native English speaker so I might have misunderstood or just missed something in the books.",18,22,False,self,,,,,

Episode 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1e0zgj/spoilers_s3e6_rankings_of_power_episode_6/,anachronissmo,1368134554,"Here is the belated rankings of power for the latest episode. 

Jon Snow +9 (Season Total: +19): Not only did you climb the friggin' wall, but you bonded with your sweetie. 

Ygritte +9 (Season Total:+9) 
Ygritte finally gets some long overdue points on the board for being an awesome climber, and finally asking Jon Snow to go steady.

Olenna Redwyne +7 (Season Total: +28):
Points awarded purely for calling out the incest twins to Tywin's face. 

Tywin Lannister +7 (Season Total: +25):
Points awarded for calling Loras out of the closet. I would say he ended up getting his way in his sparring round with Olenna, but I still have to call it a tie.

Roose Bolton +5 (Season Total: +10):
Admit it, you totally thought he was going to say ""hand"". He fucking got you good.

Melisandre +5 (Season Total: +7):
The Lady in Red has got what she needs to perform whatever fucked up ritual she has in mind. 

Beric Dondarrion +3 (Season Total: 20):
No telling if selling off Gendry will bite the Brothers in the ass later, but for now Beric scored some coin and some points with the Lord of Light.

Petyr Baelish +3 (Season Total: +3):
While his plan to steal away with Sansa fell through, he still leaves King's Landing with things in his favor. 

Robb Stark +2 (Season Total: -15):
With the Freys on board (tentatively) things are looking up for the King of the North (until next week to be sure).

Joffrey  Baratheon +2 (Season Total:-6):
Nice aim!

Samwell Tarly +1 (Season Total -5):
Because fuck it, why not?

Jaime Lannister +1 (Season Total:-5):
A promise to be returned to pappy is one thing, still a good sign. Let's see if he can ""hand""-le the trip home. See what I did there?

Varys -2 (Season Total: 9):
He may have foiled Littlefinger's plans to win Sansa, but I still can't help but feel Petyr still won this round.

Arya Stark -2 (Season Total: 4): 
Her only friend just got sold off for some sort of unholy blood ritual. Not looking good.

Brienne of Tarth -2 (Season Total: 4):
Oh you thought you were going to Kings Landing too then? Not so much.

Tyrion Lanniseter -4 (Season Total:-4):
Well, this is awkward.

Gendry -5 (Season Total: -5):
You just got sold off to be a crazy murderous priest lady, but on the bright side you are still alive.

Edmure Tully -5 (Season Total: -9):
Robb could have at least let him count her teeth.

Sansa Stark -6 (Season Total: -1):
And there goes yet another chance to escape King's Landing. P.S. Loras is gay and you don't get to marry him anyway.

Theon Greyjoy -8 (Season Total:-27):
How low can you go?

I'd like to share with you a tribute video I've made to Theon Greyjoy (exactly 8 months ago). It was the first video I've ever made (I started editing just a month before) so obviously I wasn't really skilled back then.

Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGSRnUyfBUU
 (Note: it contains Season 1 and 2 spoilers)

Hopefully you'll appreciate this as I'm currently working on a Stannis tribute as well which in my opinion will be far superior to this and more atmospherical, though I'm waiting for more scenes from Season 3 to finish it. Also it will include the official soundtrack ""Warrior of Light"", nothing can fit more than an official soundtrack in my opinion. I completed an intro (teaser) to it recently, so if you'd like to see it I could put it up in these following days. Let me know about it.

And truly thank you for attention and any constructive criticism. Enjoy!",1,8,False,default,,,,,

I try to get people into Game of Thrones and I always send them a link to the chart, and I got to thinking what an updated one would look like, showing the characters up to this point in the third season, but still without spoilers.  

Like the original, the new one contains character names, actor name, and a spoiler-free description of the character's background.

In most cases if a character doesn't have a description, it's because either 1: a description would be too spoiler-y, 2: the show hasn't revealed much or 3: its not important.  Also some characters are completely absent because their identity is meant to be a mystery for some time (the guy currently in scenes with Theon)

This isn't meant to be all inclusive but hopefully I got all the characters who have had impact so far.

While all of the major players sides are well known, and have existing treaties, or animosities, Ros's death puts a new player onto the board  While Joffrey did the actual killing, the death of Ros rests solely at littlefingers's feet.  In no particular order;

1) He gains the ear of Joffrey by indulging in his little ""experiment"" by  supplying Ros, and porbobly the idea also, and immediately sets himself into his inner circle of confidants, which seems to be pretty empty.  Which as far as I can tell includes pretty much nobody at this point.

2) He gains leverage on Joffrey because he knows his secret.  While Littlefinger not actually having to even mention it, Joffrey knows this particular behaviour will be frowned upon if it becomes general knowledge.  Plus, he may want to call upon Littlefinger in the future for additional practice targets.

3) It eliminates a leak from within Littlefinger's inner circle, and sends a message to Varys (as amplified in his later ""ladder"" speech), and to his other employees who undoubutely will notice her conspicuous absence.

3a) It let Ros know whe shouldn't have put her toe into the politics pool and betrayed him with Varys. 

4) It sets up the ""ladder"" speech, and sends the actual part of his oratory message to Varys, ""Don't fuck with me!""

5) It reinforces the point Varys made to Olenna (""He would see the word burn if eh could be king of the ashes"") as a declaration that he just isn't in it for the titles and a broken castle or two.

6) It shows he's stepping up his game by not just playing from within the shadows, but taking direct actions to elevate his position.

7) It does all of the above by giving him plausable deniability.  It was the King that did the killing, he just supplied a girl for his entertainment.  ""I thought he was just looking for instruction for his wedding night so as not to dissappoint his new bride. She was such a sweet thing, how sad.  If I had ANY idea what he had in mind...""

Is it just because the show has a budget?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1e2s53/no_spoilers_why_does_westeros_seem_so_unpopulated/,FirstToAdmitIt,1368204049,"Westeros is supposedly the size of South America, which had about 10 million inhabitants in pre-columbian times (Europe's midieval population was something like 70 million, which may be more comparable.)

It just doesn't feel like the scale of the action/plot matches the scale of the continent. For instance:

-in the first season, Ned Stark is worried that the tournament will affect the realm's finances. We are told that villagers are streaming into the city in huge numbers. But when they actually show the tournament, there are no more than 100 people watching.

-Winterfell is supposedly the capital of the northern half of the continent. Yet 100 men can hold the walls against an army? When King Robert visits in the first episode he comes straight from the wilderness into Ned Stark's court. There were no throngs of villages or any hint of commerce or anything in Winterfell. It almost seems smaller than Castle Black.

So do we have a good idea about the population of Westeros? Is the lack of people simply due to budget constraints (i'm guessing they blew out the budget for ""BlackWater"" and that had a great sense of scale)?

Does it feel like there are more people around in the books?

There are a few reasons why they might do this:

1. After the Red Wedding, killing Ygritte might drive away a lot of viewers who found the show too dark. Probably more than would stop watching because Ygritte didn't die.
2. Ygritte surviving wouldn't screw up everything the way sparing Ned or Robb would. Instead, I think it would offer new possibilities. For instance, Stannis' offer to make Jon Lord of Winterfell would be even more tempting if Ygritte survived, as he would be able to openly wed her.
3. As for how, the scene in ""The Climb"" where Ygritte revealed that she knew Jon hadn't truly turned his cloak, it hinted at a possibility that Ygritte might follow Jon back to the Watch if it came to it.",37,8,False,self,,,,,

I know that ice before electricity was possible in various ways in real life. Some techniques included thick ice houses with insulation, and insulated holes in the ground.

But could such things even be possible considering it's been ""Summer"" for years? Ice houses would probably work and not melt for one year of spring/summer. Surely not several? And I would think the same of any insulated holes in the ground. And bringing it by horse all the way from north to south would most likely end up with the ice melting considering it's probably hundreds of miles of travel.

Some of the popular Houses have no official Words from GRRM yet, and already there are a few non-canon suggestions added to the options, like the character quote used for Clegane: ""A Hound Will Never Lie To You"" or the song line used for Reyne: ""A Lion Still Has Claws.""

So here's an opportunity for anyone to suggest options for other Houses or groups missing words.  I'll create sub-threads below for popular options to group the suggestions.  If you want to suggest Words for a House that's not listed yet, just make a new subthread to get it started.  We'll review the suggestions, select winners, and add them as flair options next week. 

How to make a winning suggestion
---

Stay classy and be serious.  Mild jokes work for a few of the options, but almost all of the Words are ""real"" for the world of ASOIAF.  Anything you come up with should be just as realistic to the story, and feel like it also came from GRRM.  Here are some examples of other non-canon words already in use for the flair:

* House Clegane - *A Hound Will Never Lie To You*
* House Dayne - *Fallen and Reborn*
* House Reyne - *A Lion Still Has Claws*
* House Manderly - *A Promise Was Made*
* House Frey - *We Take Our Tolls*
* House Baratheon of King's Landing - *The King Can Do As He Likes*
* Braavosi Water Dancers - *Just So*
* Dothraki - *It Is Known*
* Dothraki Bloodriders - *Blood of my Blood*
* Dragons - *Dracarys*
* Fools - *I Know, Oh, Oh, Oh*
* Free Folk - *You Know Nothing*
* Iron Bank of Braavos - *The Iron Bank Will Have Its Due*
* Kingsguard - *The Kingsguard Does Not Flee*
* Red Priests of R'hllor - *The Night is Dark And Full of Terrors*
* Singers - *A Bear There Was, A Bear, A Bear!*
* Smallfolk - *HotPie!*
* Unsullied - *This One Obeys*

The words should have direct meaning to the House or group in a way that helps to describe or define them.  Quotes that are repeated and well-known are often good bets since they do come from GRRM too.  


The main Houses and groups needing flair Words
---

Here's a list of 15 popular flair choices that I'll set up for suggestions and voting below.

* House Baelish
* House Dondarrion
* House Harlaw
* House Payne
* House Reed
* House Seaworth
* House Selmy
* House Tarth
* House Umber
* Brotherhood Without Banners 
* Children of the Forest 
* Maesters of the Citadel 
* Sellswords
* Varys' Little Birds
* White Walkers

* Since Joffrey isn't Robert's son but *is* Cercei's, does he still have a claim to the throne? If you ignore Stannis and Renly first that is. And do Robert's bastards like Gendry have a better claim since he's the king's son? Or did he have to be legitimized while Robert was still alive? Because I thought part of the reason Joffrey had the bastards killed was because they were Robert's sons and had more claim than him (did they?). 

* If the Targaryens still ruled, would the throne go to a female like Daenerys or pass to a distant male cousin or something? Because Robert also has Targaryen blood technically.

What I love most about the TV Show are the minor changes they made to the books, I know it sounds weird, I am a hardcore book fan, I've read every book several times, but I really love those changes. Some of you may ask why, it's simply the fact that those changes were able to hook me again, to make me feel with characters because I didn't really know what happened to them, with the changes they made in the show and I just love it.
[Season 2 / ADWD kinda] (#s ""For example Dany's storyline in the end of season 2, where they stole her dragons, killed most of her people and Xaro proclaiming himself to be King of Qarth. I had no idea how they would resolve that plot twist and I am still curious, because, as you may recall, Xaro still has a role in ADWD. Did he somehow get out of that safe or will they replace this part ? I have no idea and that's what I love about these changes."")

Martin describes the Old Gods as ""the gods of the trees, the gods of the rocks and stones and mountains and streams, who had no names. there were no churches nor temples. There was no priesthood, and the symbol of them was the weirwood trees..""

We know that the First Men did indeed worship the Old Gods, because many old castles in Westeros still have a Godswood, even in the south where they worship the Seven. In fact, Harrenhal-- which was constructed after the Andal Invasion which brought the Seven to Westeros-- was built with a Godswood as well. Harren the Black was an Iron Islander so he was also, presumably, a worshiper of the Drowned God. That shows that the tradition of the Old Gods still has cultural importance in Westeros to those who now practice other religions. 

However, one thing doesn't fit. I'm mentioning specifically the legend of the construction of Storm's End, in the Age of Heros. I will link the [appropriate HBO lore video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPYdYE4CllA&amp;t=1m35s), but also paraphrase the story below:

&gt; A warrior named Durran fell in love with Elenei, whose parents were the god of the sea and goddess of the wind. She becomes mortal to be with him, which angers her parents. During Durran and Elenei's wedding, the gods call a storm forth to destroy the castle and everyone inside. Durran and Elenei survive, and Durran declare war on the gods by rebuilding his keep. Each time he rebuilt the castle the gods would send a storm to tear it down, but Durran persisted. His seventh castle, Storm's End, withstood the storms of the gods. From there on, Durran became know as Durran Godsgrief, and became the first of the Storm Kings.

My issue is that Elenei and her parents do not sound at all like the Old Gods. First off, Elenei has a name. She may have become human, but she was at least godlike until she fell in love with Durran. Secondly, these gods have clear identities and personalities, while the Old Gods are supposed to be nameless spirits.

I this a separate mythology? If so, where did this religion come from? Did the people of the Storm Lands ever accept the Old Gods? And if the First Men already practiced a religion in westeros, why would they adopt the gods of the Children of the Forest?",9,18,False,self,,,,,

That is a character that is the embodiment of the author.

J.K. Rowling used Hermione has hers.

C.S. Lewis used Professor Kirke 

J.R.R. Tolkien used Faramir in the lord of the rings and Beren in the Silmarillion. 

So my question is who if anyone is the most likely author avatar in A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones?

I wonder about this because in this very intense and complex story figuring out the author avatar would give us a great insight into how GRRM himself views the story and the goings on in the world of asoiaf.


EDIT: I think the consensus is that its Sam ""the slayer"" Tarly that is GRRM's author avatar for ASOIAF/GoT.

This seems fitting because a good author, or at least an experienced one doesn't make their avatar a central focus of the story. (looking at you JKR) but makes them someone we see a lot of but is always to the side watching big events but not really effecting them. So Sam being a big fat coward that is usually around the important shit going down but rarely being the center of attention and being the best friend of a central character just feels right. Samwell is close enough to see a lot of the good bits but just useless enough to not get in the way. 

So if we go with this, what does Sam's story and his views on the events going on tell us about how GRRM views the story and the plot going on?",68,36,False,self,,,,,

I figured this could also be a sweet little guide for anyone else trying to do the same.

Initially I wanted an overarching game/theme that the whole party could take partake in throughout the night together. The idea is to make 5 different bracelets, each representing some of the major houses in GoT (Targaryen, Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Martell - Dorne doesn't get enough love). When each guest arrives they have to choose a house, which will be designated by the bracelet. 

This is where I'd like to tie in an easy to play game. My idea was to periodically draw random houses from a hat, whoever is wearing that houses bracelet has to drink or take a shot. If any members of this house refuse, they are essentially taking the black. As the Nightswatch does not meddle in the affairs of the realm, they cannot partake in any beer pong, battleshots or other games that night (the penalty can be changed). 

If you guys wanted to elaborate or change any rules of this, please feel free.

I'm planning on sending invitations like [these](http://www.matthew-pauly.com/wp-content/images/2012/03/Game-of-Thrones-Invites-Matthew-R-Pauly-2-590x786.jpg) to all those who are invited as well.

From my perspective, these seem to be a lot of wish fulfillment. She is nothing but a spineless wimp who wants things but does not have the strength to do anything about it. 

This isn't a ""girl thing"" either - the show is rife with women who exercise power in different ways. In fact this is one of the great things about it: 

- Cersei, who is quietly manipulative of those she can exercise power over
- Arya, who is a strong fighter
- Daenerys, who is a regal presence that understands the subtleties of power and isn't afraid to exercise it
- Ygritte, who is quite simply a peer among her brethren (but also knows the power of a woman's sex and will happily use it if necessary)
- Brienne, a force of nature
- Margaery is a master manipulator

All of these women and more have had foundations laid to show their strength, power, and authority. Many have grown into their mantles of greatness, others stepped on stage already fully formed. 

Sansa has been nothing but a teary-eyed child for 26 episodes. The only thing we've seen close to anything resembling character growth is when she admitted Joffrey is a sadist in a quick outburst that she rapidly apologized for. There is nothing in this person that says ""leader"" to me. ",27,0,False,self,,,,,

For this to happen we need a few other things to occur first. We need Stannis to call death upon Balon, Joffery, and Robb. I am assuming they will burn those fetus jars instead of leeches...why else show us those. Then we need Balon to die, causing the greyjoys to fall into chaos, maybe see Asha for the first time this season. After all this Robb needs to learn of Balons death, and decide to not make the same mistake Balon did and have a pronounced heir (Jon Snow).   I really want this to happen and I feel like its crucial to the story, but 2 episodes doesn't feel like enough time to get this all in?

I just started reading the prologue, though, and they are already talking about killing the Old Bear. Are there other things in the early part of the book that might spoil the rest of this season? Or should I just wait a few more weeks until the season is over and read away to my hearts content?

I'd even call it one of my least favorite in the season.

The Jon and Ygritte scenes seemed pretty pointless to me. Any single one of the scenes was enough to get their playful relationship across (they didn't need the drum boy conversation AND the castles conversation AND the fainting conversation). I liked seeing Tormund acting more like himself, and I like the fact that Orell is so against Jon because he wants Ygritte.

In Robb's camp, we had a two-minute conversation with the Blackfish, Edmure, and Catelyn before it devolves into what seemed like a ten minute love scene with Robb and Talisa. The only significant part being that she told him of his pregnancy and [Speculation](/g ""we saw her writing an undecipherable letter."") The rest of the scene made me bored for the first time in the series.

Sansa talking with Margaery was mostly good, though I do take a bit of an issue with the way they're portraying Sansa's dislike when it comes to marrying Tyrion. In the books, it's made clear that [ASOS](/b ""her biggest problem was that he was a Lannister and that it meant she'd be in their control for longer, losing the security of Highgarden."") That distinction wasn't clearly made, and Sansa sounded as if the major problem was that Tyrion's a dwarf.

The Tywin/Joffrey scene was probably my favorite part of the episode, though I must admit I wish that Tywin put Joffrey a little more in his place. Oh well, there's always next episode. Dany's scenes were fine. I can't remember if the Yukai'i offered her ships in the book.

The Mel/Gendry scene was brief, and it didn't really have an impact on me one way or another [ASOS](/b ""I'm intrigued to see how they will adapt the Edric story to fit Gendry."") Meanwhile, the Arya scene felt kind of brief, and even the ending was underwhelming. When we get five minutes an episode with her, it's hard to really care about the story so much. Though I did like the part about her god being the God of Death (""Not today"").

Theon's scene was pretty disappointing as well. I was hoping they'd get closer to ""Boy""'s identity this episode. Instead, we had a lengthy scene of two girls picking up Ros' place to fill the HBO nudity quota culminating in ""Boy"" showing up to take Theon's....*other thing*. The first part of the scene felt really unnecessary to me.

I liked Osha's story about her man coming back as a wight, but I think she shouldn't be so hostile to the Reeds. Until tonight when she found out they want to take Bran north of the Wall, she had no real reason.

And finally, Jaime. His scenes were probably the most disappointing, and I'll start with the first one.

He says to Roose to ""tell Robb the Lannisters send their regards."" I know it's not a big change from the books, where [Minor ASOS](/b ""he says ""tell Robb I send my regards"""") but I think the change was very bad. [Major ASOS](/b ""during the RW, when he says ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards,"" Roose Bolton plants in Catelyn's mind that this was Jaime's doing. That Jaime played a hand in orchestrating her son's death."") [Major AFFFC](/b ""When she tells Brienne to bring Jaime to death, it is motivated by the knowledge that Jaime was the one who had Roose kill Robb, not just the Lannisters in general."")

And then there was the bear scene. Where to begin? Well, I was hoping for Jaime to have a dream sequence in the show, similar to that in the book. The fact that the show didn't end with ""I dreamed of you"" was very disappointing to me. The entire ending of it felt off, very anti-climactic. I expected Jaime and Brienne to at least throw Locke into the pit to be eaten by the bear. The fact that it ended with just a walk-off made me very disappointed.

**TL;DR: Overall, I found this episode to be the most boring, awkward, and underwhelming episode of the season so far, and I was hoping for more. Especially since GRRM wrote this one himself.**",52,23,False,self,,,,,

He's the kind who reads them first then sees the adaptation if he watches the show/movie at all. Now that he's seen the show, he refuses. Anyways, he absolutely hates Sansa Stark because he believes she's a weak character who is constantly whining, crying, and is generally a stupid girl. However, as a book reader I know there's so much more to her character than what the show provides yet he really doesn't want to hear my argument. I just want to get him to see that she's a very strong female character and deserves at least a little bit of respect for the fact that she shields herself with courtesies, not swords. Any help? I feel that there's been a lot of defending Sansa against show-only watchers and I'd like to get the opinion of both show-only, both, and book-only fans. Thanks in advance.",40,22,False,self,,,,,

It seemed majority of the episode was spent watching characters have sex or listening  to characters talk about sex. In itself, including those kinds of scenes is not a bad thing and they tend to add to the episode.  However, when more than half the episode is consumed with scenes not even in the book that don't have any bearing to the main story,  sacrificing time that could be used other ways seems like a waste.

Any place that mentions this song is a breeding ground for major spoilers. This means wiki, youtube, any discussions... Seriously, don't look it up. And if you just like it as a song, for the love of god don't scroll down to comments under it.

Edit: Some asshole already begun with the tradition of putting spoilers in anything about this song. He failed miserably, but I have a hunch that he won't be the last. So if you don't want to be spoiled, **don't look at the comments in this post either.**",32,126,False,self,,,,,

It was something along the lines of Daenerys character being somewhat whitewashed in the show, that she can almost do no wrong. It made me think of the other blonde haired (and less beloved) queen, and how both have somewhat similar storylines, but my perceptions of them were very different.

- Both Daenerys and Cersei Lannister marry warriors for political reasons. Daenerys finds true love; Cersei finds the man of her dreams doesnt care for her one bit:

&gt;*Cersei: I felt something for you once, you know?* 

&gt;*Robert: I know.* 

&gt;*Cersei: Even after we lost our first boy. For quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?* 

&gt;*Robert: No.* 

- They both wind up indirectly causing the deaths of those warrior husbands. Daenerys through her nave trusting of the healer Mirri gets Drogo killed, while Cersei helps Robert kill himself on his hunt.

- They both lose a son during childbirth. This seems to have a more lasting effect on Cersei, as she recounts the story to Catelyn Stark:

&gt;*Cersei: Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy. A little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now*

- Their other children both turn out to be uncontrollable monsters: Daenerys just happen to be dragons. This works to Daenerys advantage as she betrays the slaver in Astapor, and prevents Grazdan mo Eraz from taking back his gold. Contrast that to when Joffrey commits a morally reprehensible act: Cersei usually winds up getting blamed by Tyrion and Tywin for not keeping him in check.

Taking all this in, it made me think a large part of Daenerys rise has been simply good fortune. The Queen of the Andals and the Queen Regent have both made some questionable, and some outright terrible, decisions, and yet Cersei is the one suffering for hers while Dany seems to face little long term repercussions for hers.

This week's topic builds off the past few weeks of episodes, specifically dealing with the changes in Gendry's character from book to screen, so I thought why not detail all of Robert's bastards in the books, see how that is translated or perhaps will be to screen and let you in on exactly how busy Robert liked to be.....

Now On the spoiler scope, I will discuss book details that are in the books and not on the show, but for the non reader nothing will be discussed that hasn't happened by where we are currently in the show, or what is likely to happen in the show, and other than character names that the viewer has not seen yet in the show, and a few minor details from ASOS, most of the stuff I hope the non reader to gather here comes from AGOT and ACOK... So the thread is safe. 

One thing I will do for each bastard, along with a bit of their backstory is answer these questions.. 1. Are they ""acknowledged"" bastards (officially declared by their father, in this case Robert, as his bastard... It's somewhat of an ""official"" bastard) 2. Did Robert know of the Bastards existence? 3. And does the Bastard know Robert I was their father? With that being said let us begin.... 

- Mya Stone

Robert's eldest bastard is a daughter he had while living as a ward to Jon Arryn in the Vale, a few years before his rebellion.  She is not an acknowledged bastard, but as Robert did care for her prior to him leaving for his rebellion, most of the realm know of her existence, especially those in the Vale.  And while after the rebellion Robert never had any (direct) contact with Mya, he did she that she was provided for through Jon Arryn.  It's hard to say if she herself knows of her lineage as her appearance in the first novel (more on this in a second) is somewhat brief, but as her existence is (other than one other bastard) the most openly known, I feel that she knows her who she is. 

While non readers have not met this character yet, she does appear in *A Game of Thrones* acting as a guide to Catlyn and her entourage as they were escorting Tyrion to Lysa Arryn at the Eyrie.  Being somewhat tomboyish she is well able to guide them up the treacherous path that leads to the castle.  She is still at the Vale at this point in the story.  And might show up in the future, so hopefully viewers will see this character.

-  Bella (Rivers) 

While with the Brotherhood in ASOS, Arya encounters this bastard in an inn/brothel in the small town of Stony Sept, working as a prostitute. She claims to be the bastard of Robert as according to her story, she was conceived during the ""Battle of the Bells"" when Robert was temporarily cornered and hiding in the town during the Rebellion, and had gotten her mother, also a prostitute, pregnant while there.  

This is of course just her story and could be entirely untrue, though she is described with black curly hair, so it could also be very true as well.  If she is Robert's bastard it's almost certain that Robert knew nothing about her, nor ever did before his death, so she certainly wasn't acknowledged.  She is lowborn like Gendry and does not have a bastard surname, but had she been higher born, she would have been a Rivers. 

One more interesting factoid about Bella, when Arya does encounter her she is very flirtatious and comes onto Gendry as they are eating supper, completely unaware that he is also a child of Robert and her half-brother.... And he was totally into it as well, so..... THAT almost happened.  As her appearance was very minor, I seriously doubt she will ever turn up on the show, but still fun to know. 

- Barra, and the young bastards slain by Cersei/Joffrey's command

Going to combine a lot of these into one entry for convenience.. In A Game of Thrones and in season 1 we see Eddard Stark visit a brothel where he discovers yet another of Robert's bastards, an infant daughter named Barra.  Sadly the girl was killed by Joffrey's (Cersei in the books) command along with several other of Robert's bastard children.  Now in the books we don't directly see this so there is no exact number of how many other bastards Robert had, the books only mention a pair of twins that were living in Casterly Rock, but implied several more were slaughtered in King's Landing IIRC, whereas the show outright shows it in season 2.  Now none of these bastards were acknowledged the books, but we know from both season 1 and AGOT that Jon Arryn had checked in with Barra, so it's likely Robert knew of her existence.  There is very little information on the twins at Casterly Rock nor any other bastard to be sure on the questions on any of the other bastards...

Saved the big 2 for last.

- Gendry

There is actually little to add add here that the non-reader wouldn't know. Up until recently his character on show has for the most part been what it was in the books. But as for the three questions the viewer knows that Gendry himself is unaware of his parentage (and remains so in the books) and thus is unacknowledged.  Though it's never told to us if Robert knew of Gendry.  Though like Barra we might be able to assume that he did due to being checked in on by Jon Arryn. Now as per the last couple of episodes, readers know that his character has taken a large departure from the books as he has been taken by Melisandre and Stannis's men due to her need for his kings blood for a yet ""unknown purpose"", and as of last night's episode is now fully aware of his identity.  None of this happens to Gendry in the books and when as we saw last night when Arya is taken by the Hound, Gendry is left behind with the Brotherhod and disappears from the story for a while.  It seems he is taking place of a character that has been written out of season 2, and now in season 3, his character seems to be merging with....

- Edric Storm

Since it's pretty much confirmed this character is now a Gendry/Edric hybrid on the show and where his character is at this point in the boos is where Gendry will pick up at, I will fill you in on what book Edric's story is up to where we are in the show and it possibly tease where show Gendry might be heading.

Edric Storm is Robert's only acknowledged bastard child, and was conceived on Stannis' wedding night to Selyse Florent, in Stannis's own wedding bed. His mother was Delena Florent, a relative of the bride.  Due to the fact that both of Edric's parents were of Nobel birth, as well as the (in Stannis's view) extreme dishonor Robert caused him by ""using"" his wedding bed, are the reasons why Edric is the only acknowledged bastard of Robert Baratheon. He is fully aware of who his father is. And was sent presents yearly by Robert, though it was Varys who sent them for Robert.

Edric in the books first appears in A Clash of Kings. After the death of King Renly; prior to making for Kings Landing, Stannis travels first to Storm's End to regain his ""rightful"" ancestral home, as well as take control his late Brother's bastard living there, Edric.  Stannis sees Edric as his ""proof"" that Joffrey (as well as his brother and sister) is illegitimate, and wishes to use Edric to suppor his claim.  And Melisandre sees ""other purposes"" for the boy.  However Storms End is being held by castellan  Ser Cortnay Penrose, who is also acting as Edic's protector and guardian, and refuses Stannis entry to the castle, remaining loyal to the dead King Renly.  However with a bit of Melisandre's witchcraft and a potent shadow demon, Penrose is killed and Stannis takes Storm's End as well as Edric Storm.  (This was the second of two shadow demons that appear in ACOK, the first that killed Renly, and the second that kills Penrose, it is this second one that Davos witnesses the birth of in the cave underneath Storms End, not the one that did in Renly). 

Edric is taken to Dragonstone and is treated well there, he also becomes friends with princess Shireen.  However it seems Melisandre has ""plans"" for Edric yet to be revealed to the viewer...and this is where show Gendry comes in as Edric is not in the show, these ""unknown plans involving his King's Blood"" that have been teased in the past few episodes should be a point to watch for in the next few episodes.  Now it will be interesting since two characters are now one what the writers will do when it comes to Gendry in the long run, something that even book readers do not know..


Well I hoped you enjoys this week of ""adding context"", until next week, adios..

EDIT #1: Spelling, Grammar, and some rephrasing. 

EDIT#2:  It was pointed out to me in the comments that the books do point out a possible number for the all the Bastards that Robert had, and I thought I'd edit in and share the context behind that in this edit.. (thanks to u/ToxtethOGrady for reminding me of this) This is a slight spoiler for book 4 so Ill hide this behind a tag, but its minor.  [minor AFFC](#b ""In *A Feast for Crows* we through Cersei's POV get a recollection of a woods-witch named Maggy aka *Maggy the Frog* she encountered as a child.  The woman told Cersei several prophecies in the answering of her questions, one question she asked of Maggy was *Will I marry the prince?* referring to Rheagar at the time, Maggy responded, *No, you will marry the King* which referred to Robert.  Confused she asked Maggy *Will the King and I have children?*, Maggy responded *Oh, Aye, Six-and-Ten for him and three for you*.  Once again this was a prophecy, but if held at face value, it meant in total Robert had 16 bastards, subtraction out Edric, Mya, Gendry, Balla, Bella, and the twins at Kings Landing we know of that leaves 9 bastards that are not accounted for, even onto book readers.  A good deal of them could have perished at King's Landing under Cersei's order (or show Joff) but all of them?  They will probably never have any relevance in the books or on the show, but it's still an interesting thing to think on."")",98,382,False,self,,,,,

My friends and I have frequently discussed who we think would fit the roles.

The good ones who came up with were:

Victorian Greyjoy - Ray Stevenson

Suggested by a mock up posted here, I think his size, age, and physically would perfectly play to the older Greyjoy and he would fit in terms of the scope of the role - largest new Greyjoy role. He's down TV and HBO before, I think he'd be perfect to stand ont he deck in full plate mail.

Doran Martell - Edward James Olmos

We haven't seen Dorne. But, the lore suggests a different culture and ethic background. Southern Spanish or Hispansic would be a great way to go and no one would own the slow game of Doran more than Admiral Adama. He would bring the charisma and intelligence to the role and, like Ray Stevenson, generate importance for the own setting of Dorne and interest from viewers. Again, a TV actor who I could imagine fitting into the show's budget.

Wyman Manderly - John Rhys-Davies

Of the three we liked best, this would likely be the hardest. But, I think he brings the brazenness of the character along with the sutble intelligence. He probably a bit higher cost than the other two but I think it could still work.

Anyways, those were my thoughts. Please tear me apart or suggest your own ideas for potential actors for future characters.

Welcome back to the weekly series of folluwups! If you want to ask any questions that my post did not answer, feel free to do it.

* This episode was written by GRRM himself. Other episodes he wrote are ""The Pointy End"" and ""Blackwater"", arguably one of the best episodes of the series so far.

* You might consider this episode the one of the weakest so far, but you will fully appreciate all the details once you rewatch the whole season. All that foreshadowing is what made the discussion threads full of book spoilers. It's glorious. And cruel. You will watch those episodes and ask yourself ""Why didn't I see this one coming"".

**TL;DR: Background! History! Bad jokes in the headers!**

-----

**Palace of the Winds**

&gt; ""Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye"" - Ygritte, proving being badass doesn't exclude you from being a girl

* Somehow the show made sure noone repeats a phrase, ever. It doesn't seem so, but Daenerys says ""Where are my dragons"" only *once* and I'm pretty sure Ned didn't abuse ""Winter is coming"" as well. That makes it quite difficult to label anyone with a catchphrase (besides ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" and ""Hodor"" which is absolutely obligatory). There are some catchphrases from the show, though, that the readers missed. This week it was ""HAR""^TM by Tormund Giantsbane.

* Timeline reminder: ""It's complicated"". Generally all the main characters near the Wall (Sam, Jon, Bran) are west of Castle Black.

* ""You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is"" - This line might have various interpretations. It's possibly just about Jon revealing his true intentions, but this could be really ironic (I doubt this was what Orell meant) in the bigger picture. Here's what book reader knows by this point of the story - it's never fully revealed, but strongly hinted. [direwolf plot](#b ""All Stark children are wargs like Orell, not only Bran. It was Ghost who found the obsidian blades on Fist of the First Men and at this point of the books there are already hints that there is a strong connection between Jon and Ghost. They lose it once they get on the separate sides of the Wall."")

**Are We There Yet**

&gt; ""I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey"" - Blackfish

* Edmure is Walder Frey's liege lord. Marrying a daughter to one's liege lord is one of the best futures a lord can get for his children, ensuring an advance in social ranks for them and for his grandchildren. Keep in mind that most marriages you've seen so far occured exclusively between the major houses (Tully, Stark, Baratheon, Arryn, Lannister, Tyrell) for political purposes (forging natural alliances).

* Valyrian isn't just one language, there are dialects. Long story short Daenerys speaks High Valyrian, the more sophisticated language of the elites, but the common folk of the Free Cities speaks Bastard Valyrian, or rather their own dialects of it. All the Targeryan names (Daenerys, Viserys, Rhaeger, Aegon, Aemon, Aerion) and all the Free Cities (Volantis, Lys, Myr, Pentos, Qohor) are in High Valyrian.

* [direwolf plot](#b ""Grey Wind was still around during all the battles, that's mostly season 2 stuff. Robb's connection to his wolf was important as well until he became restless around his new wife's family, keep in mind that book equivalent of Talisa is from Westeros and has a family. This is the moment Grey Wind kinda leaves the picture, but the connection is there, especially if you consider that contrary to Bran, Arya and Jon, Robb isn't a POV character"")

**Stupid Little Girl Who Never Learns**

&gt; ""We could arrange to have you carried"" - Tywin Lannister, showing off his power with nothing but few steps, few seconds of silence and few words

* Quick reminder, especially for the new guys here: Tyrion is supposed to look ugly. Disfigured. Asymmetrical face and body. Two eye colours. And a giant hole in his face where his nose was supposed to be. But this is TV, there are no ugly people on TV.

* So I will repeat once more: Tyrion is an ugly drunkard known for whoring around. Keep in mind Sansa knows that her mother accused him of trying to get Bran killed (remember the knife from season 1?) and it was only trial by combat that let him go free (funny how everyone already forgot about that one). Ugly whoring drunkard who tried to kill her brother and whose nephew killed her father.

* Sansa's initial bethrothal to Joffrey was never made concerning her heritage - she had three brothers, so she would be fourth in succession (boys get the title before girls regardless of age). Now that Bran and Rickon are presumed dead, if Robb died childless, she would become the only heiress, granting her children the title of Lords of Winterfell (making Tyrion Lord Paramount). Also, even though Tywin might disgrace Tyrion, he may name Sansa's children successors to Casterly Rock.

* Book Sansa is 14. Absolutely normal marrying age in medieval times, also the ancient times, and some after Middle Ages (notable examples: Juliet from ""Romeo and Juliet"", Mary the mother of Jesus, countless historical queens). Absolutely unacceptable for modern TV.

* White cloaks: Kingsguard. Currently there are 5 of them (since Sandor Clegane left), 7th and the Lord commander being Jaime. Gold cloaks: City Watch. You might remember Janos Slynt back from Season 2, the guy shipped off to the Wall for slaughtering Robert's bastards and replaced with Bronn.

* Book description of the small council meeting involving those news ""Fishers from Braavos have seen a kraken, and sailors from Quarth talk about a three-headed dragon that hatched on a desert"".

* Robert is the one who got rid of the skulls (Targaeryens, wildfire and dragons weren't exactly what he liked). Last dragon died 170 years before GoT.

* Book Shae actually lives in a house in the city and Tyrion goes to visit her through the secret tunnels (mentioned in *Blackwater*). Making Shae Sansa's maiden simplified the plot a little bit. Furtunately we don't have much more scenes of those two.

**Biggest Brothel Ever**

&gt; ""And what happens to the things that don't bend?"" - Daenerys, proving her lack of knowledge of the words of House Martell ^(more on that later)

* It's not ""wise masters of Yunkai"", it's Wise Masters of Yunkai. Lords of the three cities in the Slaver's Bay title themselves ""___ Masters"". Astapor (Kraznys&amp;co.) were the Good Masters of Astapor. Meereen, the third city, is being ruled by the Great Masters.

* The pyramids are the reminiscent of Ghiscari Empire which predates the rise of Valyria. Note that Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen are not a part of the Free Cities.

* History 101: Ghiscari empire rules over most of Essos. Rise of Valyria (peninsula in the south of Essos). Ghis, the former capital of the empire, gets burned to the ground by dragonfire. Valyrian empire. Valyria gets blown up (volcanoes, most likely) and one of the only survivors are Targaeryans at Dragonstone in Westeros; cities of Essos declare themselves Free Cities. 100 years later and 300 prior to GoT, Aegon conquers Westeros from Dragonstone (he and his sisters rode the last three dragons in the world, at that time).

* History 102: ""Queen of the Andals and the First Men"" - First Men is the term for the first humans in Westeros. They took the weirwood trees and their gods from Children of the Forest who they fought with for hunders of years until they made the Pact which lasted for long centuries. Starks, Karstarks and Boltons are all descendants of the First Men. Andals are the men from northwestern Essos who came 4000 years after the Pact and brought the Faith of the Seven with them.

* History 103: House Martell of Dorne (the very south of Westeros) chose words ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"". They were the only piece of Westeros south of the Wall to withstand the Targaeryen invasion as they had no big cities to aim the dragonfire at. Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms later by marrying the Dornish princess to a Targaeryan king.

* You may think that Daenerys should have accepted the offer and sailed to Westeros immediately, but every single side of the conflict would win against her (excluding Stannis as he sits at two thousands by now, but who the hell knows what Melisandre is capable of when close to dragons). Robb has more people than her even after losing half of his army.

* Since the cities in Slaver's Bay are one of the largest in Essos, the ""powerful friends"" have to be some kind of organisation that transcends the political division. You remember Faceless Men? Something like that. Oh, and there's still this creepy warlock girl assassin with blue-lips. Who the hell knows.

**Bastard and M'lady**

&gt; ""Who's your one true god"" ""Death"" - Arya

* ""Where? Why? What?"": Blackwater Bay is the estuary of a river that goes long way from the Riverlands from a lake called ""God's Eye"" that's quite damn close to Harrenhal (south of it). Riverlands consists of many river systems. The other one is the Trident (north of Harrenhal). Just enjoy the view of both the Red Keep and charred shipwrecks.

* Aaaaand another look at the past: Stannis Baratheon is the man who found Gendry with Jon Arryn. His findings are the reason he left King's Landing prior to the events from GoT.

* Am I supposed to summarize all the plot from Arya chapters that got her in the Hound's hands in a way more convincing manner? I give up, let's leave it to my fellow book readers.

* If you hovered over the spoiler in the Jon section, here's the Arya part of this thread that is known by now: [direwolf plot](#b ""Arya has wolf dreams as well and there are reports of wolf packs causing great damage to Riverlands under the lead of the biggest wolf people have ever seen. You remember Nymeria?"")

**The Titular Bear And The Maiden Fair**

&gt; ""The Lannisters send their regards"" - Jaime

Tywin threatens to name Loras to the kingsguard which will prevent him from marrying Cersei. That much makes sense. But bringing up the oaths of the kingsguard made me realize that Jaime also can never marry and carry on the Lannister name. Which then brings up the question that really has me puzzled. Tywin has been portrayed over and over again as a man who cares more about lineage and the family name, saying things like: ""It's all that lives on"". 

That said, why did he allow Jaime to join the kingsguard? Jamie is the heir to Casterly Rock, but if he himself would have no heirs - who would be next in line? Tywin is utterly against Tyrion as an heir and yet he is the only one that can *technically* continue the name. 

The more I think about it, the more it seems like the Lannisters are just about the most screwed in the lineage (sub)game right now.

Ideally it should be in Valyrian glyphs, but I guess it didnt seem worthwhile to create an entire writing system for what ultimately is kind of a throwaway shot. Though I do have the text of it (in both English and High Valyrian, which is what its written in), I dont think I should put it up right now. Ill put it up when the seasons done with, but **theres been a lot of creativity amongst fans regarding Talisa, and so I think this should remain a mystery for the time being**.

When Catelyn took Tyrion captive, Bronn accompanies them to the Vale, Champions him in his trial for money since Lannisters are known to pay handsomely. 

But what if their was more, what if he knew the ramifications of Tyrion being thrown through that door? Tywin isn't exactly fond of his youngest son, but that would have been a huge slight against the honor of his house and easily would have brought the Arynns into the fight they evidently wished to play no part it.

So Tyrion and Bronn down the road they go, encountering the hill tribes and eventually meeting up with Tywin at the Lannisters camp where he Tyrion begins naming the people and their sires when we come to Bronn who states

""You wouldn't know him"" (I am aware this is not said in the book)

Now that has always sort of irked me, since it is highly unlikely Tywin knew any of the hill tribes members why Bronn would say that. It got me to thinking, what if he didn't want Tywin to know who his sire was? 

Lets examine where we first met Bronn, the Riverlands. With plenty of war in Essos, I doubt he would have left and in the ensuing chaos after Roberts rebellion, I doubt Westeros had lack of opportunity for sellswords to make coin, I would assume he wouldn't have moved too far from where he grew up and he dresses as a northerer and looks the part as well.

He is a skilled fighter, a very skilled fighter and an absolutely excellent archer. One shot, several hundred yards and right on the mark.

Name one other person in the show who has made the same feat without batting an eye. 

Perhaps I may help job your memory, lets see, tall, skinny but muscular, an excellent archer with a long narrow face and slicked back black hair.

I smell something fishy here, George.

Bryndon Tully, the Blackfish. 

Bronn was sent with Catelyn to see Lysa, to ensure Tyrions survival. He knew that Tyrions death would mean Tywin retaliating and destroying the Riverlands. 

Now you may say that he was a nobody who was knighted and ran off with his good fortune. Now when Cersei and Tywin knighted him, he obviously does not mention who he actually is lest he end up like his aunts husband. 

He got Tyrion home safely, he did his part and he has a Lannister debt to call in when he sees fit.

Bronn Rivers of The Blackwater, Bastard Son of Bryndon Tully The Blackfish.

Go watch the episode again, it transitions from Bronn grabbing wine to Bryndon entering the room drinking. If that isn't placing it in front of our faces, I don't know what is.",58,38,False,self,,,,,

  * He said in some interviews that he would do another (*) cameo in this season. 
  * S03.07 was the first episode partially filmed in the US - so it was more accesible



I watched the episode, haven't found him myself, but this is no prove he was not there :)
I expected some *found him* post on reddit, or at least a discussion. So if GRRM did not have a cameo:

 * Does someone have a more recent source on GRRM's cameo ?
 * Are there any recent speculations? My current guess would be: [Spoiler free - speculation](#g ""In one of the upcoming weddings Cercei-Loras/Edmure-Frey/Joeffrey-Margaery/Tyrion-Sansa, because in the pilot GRRM was playing a wedding guest of Dany's wedding / S03.09 would be my guess "")?

(*) The previous one was never aired.

Arya's storyline is quite akin to the ""lost it all ergo nothing to lose ergo vengeance at any cost arc"" that other authors have used and keep using.
Series' like Inheritance Cycle(Eragon et al) and Kingkiller Chronicles (The name of the Wind et al) are based around characters whose early life experience is very similar to Arya's . These are just two of many examples am pretty sure fiction readers can come up with.


A child who loses her family, her friends and basically her world as she knows it- can only come to one resolve when it comes to her identity and the purpose of (her) life.
Remember Arya is very young( nine at begining of game of thrones-so  think of yourself when your were in 3rd/4th grade).

Given, girls in westeros/asoiaf are supposed to ""mature"" early, but after feigning to be so many people/taking on so many identities 
at that age just to survive isn't going to leave you in a very healthy emotional state.

For those people who live life by the moment (and the younger you are the more likely you do live it like that) her ""inner struggle""

(Side Note:GRRM belives that the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about- it is the overreaching theme across all his POVs, and almost all his characters go through it-except perhaps Varys who seems to have resolved his inner conflict to a great extent)

has two moments that best signify it

1)http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bazzz/spoilers_asos_arya_stark_of_winterfell/

2)When she decides to hide needle.

The second tells us that her training has to go huge lengths to -destroy/bury/ make her apathetic- to her past.

This is because from the moment Ned died till her journey to Essos, Arya has been as outwardly helpless as she has been innately willful(unlike say Sansa who is innately more subservient and ""lady like"" and such).

The way of the faceless men/the guild is (pretty much) in alignment with her motive in life- to kill. 
This will make it impossible for her to become truly Faceless.

(**NOTE**: Some links might have spoilers.)

* An amazing number of readers have so little self-control, and/or so little ability to distinguish between reality and fiction, that unexpected events can cause them to violently throw books at walls.
* The louder a viewer pulls a tantrum at a certain alleged difference between the TV show versus the books, the more likely it is that [the show is actually more accurate to the text than his faulty memory](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dszpo/spoilers_all_the_surprising_and_powerful_ending/c9tozn9?context=3).
* People are incapable of clicking on links labeled in extra-large letters ""Frequently Asked Questions"", no matter where they are located.
* The right to watch *Game of Thrones* without paying a cent is allegedly enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights.
* People who would have literally killed anyone spoiling them while reading the books think that those who just watch the show deserve every spoiler they run into because, hey, they're stupid ""non book readers"", amirite?
* Despite 48 failures, the [49th 400-post thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/87137-rlj-v49/) on a certain popular fan theory will surely clear up all the mysteries and debates surrounding said theory.
* A scarily large number of people would be incapable, if given the opportunity, of resisting [physically attacking actors who portray detestable fictional characters](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9v1h/what_fictional_character_do_you_hate_so_much_that/).
* Actresses don't usually get such treatment, fortunately. Unfortunately, their characters are often instead called ""bitches"", ""whores"", and/or are [threatened with rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1cw4jh/spoilers3e4_couldnt_help_thinking_this_as_the/c9l94gp?context=3).
* Despite being given the gift of 5,000 pages of additional content to relish at their leisure, many TV-first fans are so lazy that they want to [immediately abandon two fifths of said gift](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/zq036/spoilers_season_2asos_if_you_are_planning_to_jump/). (Said figure will rise each year of the show, of course. I pity the mods here who will have to deal with 1,000 ""On what page can I start reading book 3 to continue the story?"" posts the moment S3E10 ends next month.)
* People are incapable of doing even a cursory search to check to see whether their brand new, 100% unique theory or cool fan art link has ever been posted before doing so. (If it has, they'll often alter the URL a little to bypass Reddit's anti-duplication mechanism. Nothing is more important than fake Internet points, right?)
* People who post comments consisting solely of the words ""Heh"" or ""You sweet summer child"" merit immediate public execution. (""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention"" is rapidly emerging as a contender for the same punishment.)",1,0,False,self,,,,,

There's the minor inconsistency of apples being noticeably smaller than dog skulls, but I'm okay with that since people grasp at strange comparisons sometimes when trying to express something like that, combined with the length of time it's been since either of them saw those skulls.",24,70,False,self,,,,,

Characters make reference to events that happened in the past, and I've never been able to really follow what they're talking about.

I've written a guide to help you prevent yourself from annoying users on youtube and twitch.tv websites.  
  
The above sites are the ones I visit the most. And the abominations I've seen there are really bothering. For example, my brother was spoiled by a certain event in a certain part of the book just by a twitch.tv spoiler.  
  
Another example is the youtube comment section, where people try to prevent spoilers from reaching top by filling the 2 top best comments (most common) with warnings. 
  
I've written 2 styles where the comment and chat sections are removed from these sites. It's a very easy fix, that stays forever until you disable it.
  
    
**Simple solution:**  
**1. Install Stylish plugin for:**  
* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe  
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=search  
  
    
**2. Install the styles I created** (they involve only display:none attributes  a known way to disabling any object you see on any website  client side):  
* Youtube: http://userstyles.org/styles/87570/youtube-no-chat?r=1368647260  
* Twitch.tv: http://userstyles.org/styles/87568/twitch-no-chat-and-full-width?r=1368646064  
    
  
That said, reddit crowd voting does a pretty good job in spoiler prevention.  
  
That's it, hope this helps.  
  
Info1: The above site alterations could be used on any website which contain a comment or chat section.

The history and lore of this thousands-years old world is definitely one of the highlights about the books, but it seems much of this history and lore has been left out by the HBO show.

So, every week on Wednesday, I plan on posting a different history ""lesson"" about the world of GoT, starting with this week.

**A Note on Spoilers:** I won't spoil things past the current episode of HBO (Season 3, Episode 7) in terms of plot. Of course, the whole point of this series of posts will be to give some extra information to non-readers about the history of this wonderfully-constructed world, so most of what will be here is taken from the books, even if it contains no spoilers.

[Map for those who want to keep track of locations](http://www.sermountaingoat.co.uk/map/versions/speculative_map.jpg)

##CHILDREN OF THE FOREST

Children of the Forest are a different species from humans, but they are human-like. They were the original inhabitants of the Westeros continent before humans came over, but they are all but extinct now. A Child of the Forest hasn't been seen by man for thousands of year. They are beautiful creatures, called ""Children"" because the tallest is no larger than a human child.

They did not use metal, weave cloth, or build cities. They lived as one with nature, using tree bark and stone for tools and materials. They lived mostly in [crannogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crannog), caves, and villages hidden in trees. They had no ink, no parchment, and no written language. They used obsidian weapons and hunted (men and women hunted together). They were a magical people.

The greensight that Jojen and Bran both have were common among the Children. They carved faces into the [weirwoods](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/c/cf/Winterfell_Godswood.jpg) to keep watch over the woods. They believed the faces to be their gods, called the ""old gods"" by the current Westerosi. When they died, they believed they became a part of the gods. [ADWD](/b ""We know from the books this is true, but it hadn't been revealed at this point in the book."")

It is unknown when they came to Westeros or if they originated there. It's unknown how long they even occupied it. But for thousands of years, they occupied it alone.

##FIRST MEN

This might sound a bit more familiar. The First Men were the culture of humans that first set foot on Westerosi soil. Most Northmen trace their lineage back to the First Men. When Jon first met Ygritte last season, he told her that he was of the North, and that they had the same ancestors. The Starks are descendants of the First Men, as are the Karstarks, the Boltons, and the Umbers among other houses.

Around 12,000 years before Aegon the Conqueror came to Westeros (which itself was about 300 years before the start of the series), the First Men came from Essos to Westseros by crossing a land bridge called the Arm of Dorne. If you look over at Dorne (the southernmost part of Westeros) on the map, you will see an archipelago of broken islands between it and Essos.

The First Men inhabited much of the continent, even going to the Iron Islands. The First Men were the founders of the Seastone Chair, which is the ""Iron Throne"" of the Iron Islands, which King Balon now sits upon. The Seastone Chair was the seat of many Ironborn kings before Aegon killed Harren the Black at Harrenhal (more on Aegon's Landing in another post).

They were the ones who named the Children. Before that, the children called themselves ""those who sing the song of the earth,"" in their Ancient Tongue.

**War With the Children**

The First Men came to Westeros with bronze weapons mounted on horses. As they settled in Westeros, they cut down the weirwoods, which the Children believed to be the gods watching over them. This prompted a war with the Children, who supposedly used dark magic to break the Arm of Dorne and create the broken islands between the two continents. Still, the First Men were larger, stronger, and had weapons.

Whenever the First Men warred with the Children, they cut down and burned the weirwood trees of the land they took, believing that the greenseers could see through the face of the weirwood.

The First Men eventually (around 10,000 years ago) built Moat Cailin, a castle (in the North, right above the Neck if you're looking at the map). Moat Cailin in current times is boasted as the North's greatest defense to the South. An army in the hundreds of thousands could march on it from the south and a garrison of a hundred could repel them.

Anywho...The Children attempted to stop the invading First Men by using magic to break the Neck and separate the North from the South. Instead, they only managed to flood the Neck, which created bogs and swamps. Even in current times, it is hard to navigate the Neck.

Fortunately for the Children, the flooding was enough to make the First Men sue for peace, and they ended their wars with the weirwoods in the South cut down and the ones in the North remaining. Thus, when a Northman goes south, it is lore and superstition that they are no longer under the protection of the old gods. See how that worked for Ned?

Anyway, the Children and First Men had peace at the Isle of Faces, which maintained its weirwoods (it's in the Riverlands in the middle of the lake near Harrenhal, for those looking at the map). The First Men allowed the Children the forests of the North in return for the First Men claiming the south. This pact began 4,000 years of friendship between the First Men and the Children. The years that followed were known as the Age of Heroes, and the First Men put aside their gods to worship the old gods.

##The Others

Also known in the HBO series as **The White Walkers** (and sometimes called white walkers by wildlings). According to common legend, the Others appeared around 8,000 years before Aegon's Landing (again, which was ~300 years before the HBO series) during the Long Night. The Long Night was a winter that lasted a generation, and was spoken of by Old Nan in (I want to say) Season 1, when talking to Bran.

The Others are thought to be demons. They can raise wights, dead bodies, and are characterized by the cool, glowing blue of their eyes. They come from the Land of Always Winter

**The War for the Dawn**

When the Others moved south, the Children and First Men both fought to defend the continent from icy invasion, but were eventually pushed back. The Children and FM found a weapon that could kill an Other (not going to name what weapon it is, as it might be considered a spoiler).

It was then that the hero Azor Ahai, a great hero, led the war against the Others wielding his sword of fire, Lightbringer, and drove the Other back. More on the legend of Azor Ahai in a different post.

After this war, the Wall was raised to protect the realm, and it is said the be imbued with the Children's magic to protect the Realm. The Wall was raised by a First Man named Brandon Stark, known as Bran the Builder (one of many Brandons in the Stark lineage, the most recent being Bran from the HBO series). The Night's Watch was established to protect the people of Westeros against the Others.

Over the course of thousands of years, the Others became known as a myth, a scary story that mothers tell their children to frighten them. Legend states that one day, the Others will return and Azor Ahai will be reborn to lead the fight against them.

Of course, we all know the Others (white walkers) and their wights are back. They were the first thing we saw in Season 1, the last thing we saw in Season 2, and are currently marching (slowly) south towards the Wall.

##The Andals

The Andals originated in Essos in the Hills of Andalos (below Braavos on the west coast, called ""Andalos"" on this unofficial map). Their first king was Hugor of the Hill, and was supposedly crowned by the Seven themselves. Yes, the Faith of the Seven ""new gods"" (Father, Warrior, Smith, Crone, Mother, Maiden, Stranger) originated with the Andals while the First Men and Children worshiped the old gods.

Around 6,000 years before Aegon's landing, the Andals first sailed to Westeros. Instead of Dorne, they arrived in the Vale, landing at the Fingers. The original Andal invaders painted and carved the seven-pointed star of the Seven on their bodies. They destroyed all the weirwood trees and Children that they came across. After hundreds of years of war, the Andals managed to conquer the lower six kingdoms (Dorne, Reach, Stormlands, Riverlands, West, and Vale) and created their own kingdom.

Only the Kings of Winter resisted the Andals successfully, stopping them at...shocker...Moat Cailin.

The Andals are arguably the largest cultural factor of current-day Westeros. They brought the religion of the new gods, which remains the largest religion. Their language became known as the Common Tongue, and is the language spoken by all characters (up until this point, the First Men spoke the Old Tongue, which is still spoken by a few wildlings north of the Wall). Their writing system was better than the runes of the First Men and the non-existent written language of the Children.

Most people in the South are descendants of the Andals. In Essos, remember that Jorah is sometimes called (by the Dothraki and by Quaithe in Qarth) ""Jorah the Andal."" The current kings of Westeros are styled ""King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men."" (We will get to Rhoynar next week; also, the show completely ignores the Rhoynar when Dany styles herself ""Queen of the Andals and the First Men"").

So those are four of the major anicent races (and species) and their ancient history from before Aegon's Landing. Sorry this was so long, but it was my first post.

On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.""

Its obvious to anyone reading that that she was prophesysing the death of Balon Greyjoy and the man with no face was a faceless man. All the clues point to it being Euron Crows-Eye who hired the faceless man as it was a 'crow' on his shoulder in the prophecy, Euron is rich enough to hire a faceless man and he arrived immediately after Balon fell.

But the fact that the crow was ""drowned"" and had ""seaweed hanging from his wings"" got me thinking. Aeron Damphair is a priest of the drowned god and garbs himself in seaweed, so it seems as though Aeron and Euron worked together in this.

Im sure someone has already asked this, so sorry if repost. But what i want to know is why two men who appear to despise each other would work together on this.

What are your thoughts men of the watch?

There are so many characters that, if events conspire in their favour, may yet end up on the Iron Throne, I have no idea who it will be and frankly don't want to know, but who do you wish it were? Personally I'd love it if Arya Stark or Tyrion Lannister ended up the King or Queen. Outside chances certainly but it'd be satisfying to see it unfold that way. 

I'm guessing that in the end Robb Stark, Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen will be the eventual victor in the game of thrones but there are so many characters I'd like to see take on the role.

Time for another edition of Rankings of Power. It has come to my attention that many folks have no idea what this is all about. First of all this is just for fun, so don't take it too serious. Points are award solely based on my opinion. The Power Rating does not reflect the character's power within the realm neccasarily, but rather a combination of how awesome they are and what happens to them good or bad. That is all.

Jaime Lannister +7 (Season Total: +2)
The stump is loose.

Twyin Lannister +6 (Season Total: :+31) 
Finally putting his bitch grandson in his place in a way that only Tywin knows how, subtle intimidation.

The Torturer +5 (Season Total: +14)
You sir, are good at torturing. 

Brienne of Tarth +5 (Season Total: : +9)
That bear didn't have a chance.

Robb Stark +5 (Season Total: : -10)
Maybe the worst strategist of all the throne contenders, but at least he has the hottest wife.

Melisandre +3 (Season Total: +10)
She has got what she needs for her next magic trick. Can't wait to see what she has up her robe.

Daenyrs Stormborn +3 (Season Total: +36)
She's got the dragons and a slave army and she is super badass. But her liberation agenda is really hampering her Iron Throne prospects.

Jon Snow +2 (Season Total:  +21)
He is getting closer to Ygritte, but with Orell trying to cockblock and the reality of war looming things could get shitty fast.

Ygritte +2 (Season Total:  +9)
Ditto.

The Hound +2 (Season Total:: +4)
He snagged himself the Stark bitch. Not sure why, but good for you.

Gendry +2 (Season Total: -5)
Blood still in body, so far so good. Oh and by the way, your real daddy was the king!

Blackfish Tully +1 (Season Total: +9)
Wet shit, 'nuff said.

Sansa Stark +1 (Season Total: 0)
Somebody just tell her Loras is a sword swallower already.

Bran Stark +1 (Season Total: : +4)
Destiny!!!!!!!!

Joffrey Baratheon +1 (Season Total: -5)
Somehow managed not to get slapped by Grandpa. Plus, he is probably right about the dragons.

Edmure Tully +1 (Season Total: : -8)
One more day of bachelorhood, not too shabby.

Tyrion Lannister -2 (Season Total: : -6)
Hate to see this guy get his heart broken.

Shae -3 (Season Total: : -2)
Breaking up is hard to do.

Arya Stark -5 (Season Total: -1)
I know she is badass, and doesn't take no shit. Stands up to everybody and is being set up to be []( #b ""an awesome assassin"").but she just got kidnapped by the Hound, so for now she loses points. Deal with it.

Theon Greyjoy -10 (Season Total: -37)
Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does.

I myself will be attending the Bellvue event, so anyone in the greater Seattle area that wants to come say hi, or a take a swing at the Official Spokesperson and Head of PR for House Baratheon (Ours is the Fury! ) is welcome. Teams are limited to a maximum of 6, but anyone is welcome to hang out with Tib's Titans (since we totally got this). I mean, I'm not saying I'll ban people if we lose, 'cause that would be petty, but I could probably make one of the other mods do it.

In all seriousness though, this is looks to be a fun event and a cool way to hang out with your fellow redditors. I'm looking forward to meeting you guys!

I haven't read the books but I noticed that in Winterfell, Theon's men betrayed him and possibly put a hood over his head, but it wasn't really Theon's men that did that were they? Because that would mean that the people torturing Theon are doing so on the orders of Yara or Balon. 

My theory is, and I might be wrong - it was Bolton's men that took Theon and the sadistic guy torturing him is Bolton's bastard son who Bolton said couldn't escape Winterfell with Theon alive and only with his head. Maybe Bolton just wanted to give his son a body to torture since he seems so into it and the guy mentioned that everything happening to Theon isn't happening for a reason. I'm guessing he'll kill Theon in the next few episodes and send the head to Rob.

Going back, Winterfell was sacked and the Iron Born possibly surrendered to Bolton's men. So was it Bolton who sacked Winterfell? I don't see why he'd do that, but then again he isn't completely loyal to Rob, is he? Since he let Jaime go to King's Landing.

Bolton's allegiance obviously doesn't lie with the Starks. I was thinking that he might be in with the Lannisters, but then he wouldnt have to make it a point to tell Jaime to put in a good word with Tywin.

Also what's up with Talisa? people keep talking about her being a traitor. Man! I'd love to see Rob's son on the throne!

And while I will keep the spoilers minor and focused, and non-readers won't come out with too much foreknowledge, I'd still be weary of the comments, tha being said...

I was listening to the latest episode of ""A Podcast of Ice and Fire"" today and among the discussion the hosts had was whether or not some of the plot details in the last two episodes could be considered (book) canon and spoilers for book readers.  The first two were the back stories of both Melisandre and Osha we had in the last episode, book readers already knew Melisandre was a slave per having that revealed in ADWD, but the bit about her mother was completely new.  And Osha's entire backstory of what happened to her north of the Wall has never in the books.  Usually these extra bits of information that the show adds can be called show-isms and only count as show canon, not a problem they do this all the time and its easy to discount it from actual book canon.  However as the latest episode was written by George R R Martin what are we to make of these two bits of information, could this new info on OSHA and Mel be considered book canon? Could readers expect these tidbits to come up in the next or last book?

The last example is a bit more concerning and comes from episode 6.  During the scene where Melisandre takes Gendry from the brotherhood, and speaks with Arya.  Book readers know that this never happens in the books, nor does Arya ever meet Melisandre...at least not by the end if ADWD.  That's the concerning part, as in that episode Mel tells Arya that ""They will meet again""..... What?  As I said they have never met so far in the books, the prospect of Mel saying they'll meet again concerns me that it could be a future book spoiler.  We know GRRM has shared several critical plot points from future books with the show runners, was ""Arya and Melisandre will meet"" one of them?  

Should book readers be concerned that as the series progresses that more things like these examples could creep into the show and potentially spoil plot points that readers have not got to yet?  And if that is the case how does the general book reader feel about that? Do you stop watching the show in fear of future book spoilers? Should there be that much cause to worry?

 I think minor points like what I mentioned could continue to happen, and possibly grow more frequent as the series catches up to the books (and obviously should the show eclipse the books EVERYTHING on the show would then be spoilers to readers).  I love the books and am not too hot on the idea of books plot points, however minor, being revealed first on the show before I find it out in the novels, but as some readers have commented, I don't see myself stop watching the show if something like the Melisandre ""We'll meet again"" becomes too frequent, it was the show that got me into the series and introduced me to the novels, and I really love the show too much to ever stop watching..

  I admit that if in The Winds of Winter or in A Dream of Spring Arya meets with Mel I would be a tad upset that the show had spoiled the surprise of that meeting, (Though I am intrugued by what would happen in that situation, from a boom standpoint) I would still enjoy the book as I do the show....  I just hope going forward that the show runners keep in mind that a larger part of their audience are book readers, and they (given their foreknowledge of unpublished books) keep these moments to an absolute minimum, should they turn out to be real spoilers.

The show killed Robb's story a little by detracting his genius victories and strategies in favor of the extended Talisa debacle. But Robb is only 17, he has a smaller force than the Lannisters and is taking on somebody who has 30+ years of war experience over him. Even with all his disadvantages hes accomplished a lot. to start:

**The capture of Jaime:** Jaime Lannister has been winning victory after victory and besieges Riverrun, while Tywin has been holding the rest of the forces in anticipation of Robb's arrival.

-Robb captures a spy and sends him to Tywin with false information. and Sends a diversionary force towards Tywin to hold him off, and thins the ranks to make them look bigger than they really are.

-He then sends a raiding party to attack Jaime's supply lines and draw him out.

-Eager for more fighting Jaime pursues them on horseback and gets himself caught in an ambush.

-With Jaime's best men killed or captured, Robb smashes his army into the rest of Jaime's men securing Riverrun. This was a 10-1 stark victory according to Theon.

**Oxcross**: Remember the opening of episode 4 of season 2 where a couple of guys get ambushed by Robb and his direwolf? Did you wonder why Robb was fighting battles while Tywin hangs out in Harrenhall? This was because of another of Robb's genius decisions. After Jaimes' capture Tywin was held up in Harrenhall, while Robb had Riverrun. Neither wanted to attack the other because they knew whoever marched would lose. Tywin continued to raid the riverlands so Robb, making stupid decision #1 decides to let the riverlords use their men to defend their keeps. Because of this, every day the riverlords start abandoning Robb's army to muster in their own keeps. Tywin in the meantime has his cousin muster up and train another force at Oxcross to flank Robb in Riverrun. So stuck with a dwindling army what does Robb do?

-March his remaining men to the new Lannister army at Oxcross.

-He rides ahead with all of his cavalry and slips behind the Lannister outposts using uncharted woods as his cover. Ambushes the untrained men in the dead of night slaughtering them. After this he sacks Lannister town after Lannister town taking back gold, cattle and tons of supplies (the scenes with Talisa is the aftermant of each victory). This Forces Tywin's hand to abandon Harrenhal and meet Robb on his battlefield. Unfortunately Stannis attacked at the wrong time making Tywin turn his army around to defend kings landing, Preventing Robb from ambushing Tywin. But at least Robb got Harrenhall.

Call him out on being shitty at diplomacy. But Robb is a military genius, and can go toe to toe against a larger force commanded by the greatest general in the realm.

For anyone who hasn't read the books, stop here.

I don't mind the fact the show is doing its own thing with the story and Im not the type to get on my high horse because I have read the books and therefore the show must suck.
Season was one was amazing and season two also was as good as it could be.
But for me season three is struggling. Like I said, I dont mind the show not following the book and story arcs not being included but the constant joke parts and sexual innuendo parts are killing me.
For example, when Tryion told Sansa he had to marry her with Shea in the room. It seemed like an episode of Seinfeld or something. The imp had this 'oh this is going to be awkward' thing going on, just like a lame sitcom (Seinfeld isn't lame). In the book it was so cruel when Sansa never knew she was marrying Tryion till she was walking down the aisle. 

Also when Bron and Tryion were talking about whether the imp wanted to fuck Sansa, was this how I met your mother? I expected them to high five and quote the bro-code.

Those two scenes about Pod being good at sex or something was such a waste of time. They are cutting out so much, which is fine but don't fill that time with bullcrap.

They are going this soft and sex sells path, I will very interested to see how they do the red wedding.

I've seen till season three ep 7, but now i'm reading the books and rewatching the series.

I noticed in season 2 that Eddard sent a letter to Stannis about the incest between Jaime and Cersei but it seems there is no mention in the book of it in the prologue that Stannis knows this. Does he know about the truth about Joffrey or does he just calls himself the true king?

GOT is Benioff &amp; Weiss, 1,000 years in the future, producing a fictionalized version of the events.  Knowledge of the main events has almost all survived, but many of the original documents have been lost/damaged, so Benioff &amp; Weiss fill in the gaps with their own fictionalized details and focus on some characters who never actually left records (i.e Margaery, Ros, etc).

To me, looking at the show this way justifies almost all of the changes that Benioff &amp; Weiss have made, and I can begin to understand their thought process in telling their own version of the story.",5,0,False,default,,,,,

Why did Drogo give a shit about Daenerys? I get that Illyro brokered the deal and probably has ulterior motives, in addition to being in cahoots with Varys. I just don't understand why Drogo would even care. I mean, yeah, she is pretty, but there are other pretty girls, and he could seemingly have whomever he likes. From his nomadic horselord perspective what makes her so special that he would commit an army to someone as payment (and did he plan on not fulfilling this from the beginning, even before he knew Viserys sucked?)?

2. Why did Tyrion send Marcella to Dorne? I understand he was trying to weed out the dishonest members of the council, and the Dorne story was the one Pycelle was told. But he told three versions of the story, so clearly he had no particular affinity for any specific one of them (they were just a means to an end). If Littlefinger had been the snitch, would he have sent her to the Vale? I mean why not, after he confirmed Pycelle's treachery, just go up to Cersei and say, ""Meh, changed my mind, I'm not gonna send her off, she can stay."" He already achieved what he set out to, so I am confused.  

I know I have other questions, but these are the only one's off the top of my head that have been bothering me lately.

EDIT: I've since discovered that the Tyrion bit is purely a show construction and that in the books, Drogo is not as ignorant as he seems in the show. That is satisfactory to me.

Ok so, I am only a tv show watcher, haven't read the books. It's possible my memory of Season 2 is a bit fuzzy.

Anywho, I seem to remember Jon Snow getting ""caught"" by his red-head ladyfriend, and him and another Night's Watchmen being taken prisoner. He then had to convince the wildings that he was a defector (even though he really wasn't) and killed the other Night's Watchman, to prove himself.

So, for the rest of season 2 and all of season 3, I've just assumed that Jon Snow was working undercover.

But now....I'll admit, I'm lost. Has he actually *become* a wildling? Is he still playing undercover? I can't figure out what's going on.

Now, it's possible that's the whole point, that we really don't know. If that's so, then ok. Just let me know ""Fubsy, you *should* be confused right now, bwa-ha-ha.""",28,12,False,self,,,,,

As we know from the books Catelyn is pulled from the river by Nymeria and the wolves reek havoc to the riverlands.

Perhaps in the intro to episode 9 or 10 we will be given a refresher of Arya telling Nymeria to leave. Later in the episode we will see a hulking direwolf followed by its pack performing various acts mentioned in the books.

As far as I know we haven't had anyone in the show speak of a pack of wolves causing trouble, so I'm a little sceptical.  But I think this would be a great addition to one of the final episodes.

Every other great house singlehandedly has at least 50,000 soldiers in their army, but the Starks barely muster 20,000 men, if not less. When combined with the force of the Tully's, I believe their numbers don't increase that much at all.

The Martells have at least 50,000 soldiers

The Baratheons ( Storms End ) musters at least 50,000 soldiers

The Tyrell's have at least 50,000 soldiers

The Lannisters have between 40,000 - 50,0000 soldiers at peak time

The Starks barely have 20,000 soldiers

The Tully's have between 10,000 to 30,000 soldiers, not sure.

House Arryn and Greyjoy are unknown ( to my knowledge )

How come the Starks and Tully's have such a insignificant force? All of the houses above have a good 30,000 men more than the Starks one on one, which is more than double. When the Starks combine with the Tully's they got maybe 40,000 AT MOST, at peak time, and even that is pushing it I think.

So why does the largest and vastest section of Westeros ( The North ) have so little soldiers? Even Dorne, which is said to have one of the smallest populations in Westeros, has double the men. ",9,6,False,self,,,,,

So I have an okay understanding of the timeline from when the show starts, to where everyone's respective story line ends up by the latest book. Onto the topic and point of this thread:

I believe Jon Snow is in fact Lyanna Stark's son, not Eddard Stark's. This may come as no surprise to many of you as this is a somewhat popular theory, but my question is as follows; Is it possible that Jon Snow is in fact the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, making him have a claim to the Iron Throne? I believe Jon's story arcs are building up to something larger than becoming commander of the Night's watch. Jon might be the deliverer of the Stark vengeance.

He ordered Amory Loche (sp?) and Gregor Clegane to Aegon and his sister, but did someone take Aegon away and trade him for another baby boy or did Tywin know about it or even do it himself? Kevan obviously wasn't aware of the plan, according to the epilogue at the end of DWD, but Doran Martell clearly did. 

On the one hand, Tywin was loyal to the Targaryaens for many years before Robert's Rebellion and stayed out of that war for as long as possible until there was a clear winner. Makes sense that the Lannisters would put no stake in the Rebellion either way unless they could win out from it, and even though Tywin was Aerys' Hand for awhile he did resign because he was tired of the King's shenanigans. So it is possible that Tywin wanted to get rid of the Mad King, thus siding with the Baratheons and Starks, but eventually restore a Targaryen to the throne. De facto control of the throne in the meantime via Robert and his ""sons"" was just icing. 

On the other hand, controlling the throne in fact and in name through Joffrey and Tommen is pretty much as good as it gets. Yeah, technically they are Baratheons, but give it a few generations and there could be a Lannister king. Giving up control of the throne to someone else is a big step down from being the ruling family, even if it is to a rightful Targaryen king.

As my username suggests, Robb Stark is my favorite character from the series, and as the topic title here suggests, I am indeed a book-reader (who has read all the books). Robb became my favorite character as I read the books despite his lack of screentime simply because I really do enjoy the archetype of ""the good king"" - he is kind, just, brave, and has a sound mind for military matters.


While I definitely enjoy the greatly increased screentime Robb has been given in the show compared to the books, I do feel that some of the changes the producers of the show have made hurt the audience's perception of his character. Most of these changes are admittedly quite minor, sometimes as little as a slight change of words - nevertheless, even changes so small as these make a significant impact upon the audience's perception of a character. This ""essay"" of sorts will contain significant spoilers for ACOK/Season 2, but for anyone who has been actively keeping up with the show, they shouldn't matter. It SHOULD NOT contain (significant) spoilers for ASOS/Season 3 - if any commenters notice/feel that it does, please post so and I will edit ASAP.


First of all, I'll address something I find to be a persistent problem in posts/comments concerning Robb that greatly irks me - the difference between tactics and strategy. I'm not actually a military man, but I personally feel I have a greater understanding of military matters than the average joe. In layman's terms, tactics are small-scale (think maneuvering units on a battlefield) while strategy is large-scale (think maneuver armies on a continent); there is of course the vastly more important third dimension of logistics, but this being a fantasy book/TV series and not real life, it is far less important a concern, especially when it comes to a character being interpreted by a general audience. Thus I continue - Robb Stark is a brilliant tactician and a great strategist, but an awful politician; if using the term *strategy* in terms of *grand* strategy and encompassing strategic elements *not* confined to military matters, then Robb is a brilliant tactician and a bad strategist.


Moving on, I will address what is perhaps the most degrading change for Robb from the books to the TV show; while it might seem very minor, it is actually quite significant - the conversation between Robb and Edmure Tully (which IIRC was in 3x03 in the TV series). In the books, Robb had been burning and harassing the Westerlands throughout ACOK, not just to burn the homelands of the Lannisters, but also for a far more devious purpose - to lure Tywin Lannister and his army westward. To go a little more in depth about the strategic situation in ACOK, Tywin had been sitting in Harrenhal (the largest and perhaps most defensible castle in Westeros) since the Battles of the Greek Fork and Whispering Woods, settling into a defensive position while his relative Ser Stafford Lannister mustered another army at Lannisport. Tywin was hoping to provoke Robb into a strategic blunder, most likely in either staying put himself or attacking Harrenhal directly - with two large armies pincering him from two sides, Robb would ultimately be destroyed if he stayed put, and if he attacked Harrenhal it would be a disaster (a protracted siege would be akin to staying put as well, as Stafford's army could attack him from the rear). Robb secretly moved into the Westerlands and destroyed Stafford's army while they were encamped by force-marching his vanguard of cavalry under cover of night - a brilliant solution to an almost no-win situation.


But this we saw in the books and the show alike. But Robb destroying Stafford's army at Oxcross flipped the table, and now Tywin was in a no-win situation - either stay put and lose the Westerlands to Robb AND King's Landing to Renly/Stannis, or make a move on one. Tywin chose to move against Robb, as Stannis was apparently doing nothing in the east - this was exactly as Robb had planned. Robb instructed Edmure to sit tight in Riverrun and do nothing, but Edmure (being overly eager to prove himself and simply foolish in general) decided to take the initiative and hold Tywin's vanguard (led by Ser Gregor Clegane) at the Fords (aka the stone mill). He bloodied Clegane and forced him to retreat, but this ultimately meant that Tywin could receive word that Stannis was besieging King's Landing with overwhelming force and wheel around to relieve the city, and thus save the Lannisters' claim to the Iron Throne. Keep in mind that Westeros is big, as in the size of South America big. It's not the size of the British Isles or something. Recall that in the time it took Tyrion to leave Winterfell, go to the Wall, return to Winterfell, and start heading for KL, Catelyn Stark managed to ride to White Harbor, take a ship to KL, tell Ned about stuff, and leave KL- the two met in the Riverlands, and Catelyn even left *after* Tyrion.


Robb's ultimate plan the entire time in the books was to lure Tywin westward and thus leave King's Landing (and Joffrey/Cersei) wide open for Stannis to take. Robb's aim was *NEVER* to actually take the Westerlands or Casterly Rock, or even to destroy Tywin's army - he had a greater strategic goal in mind. In the show, his aim was simply to lure Gregor Clegane and his small army/raiding party west so he could ambush and destroy them. Hopefully you see how even this small change greatly diminishes the audience's perception of how intelligent and capable Robb Stark is.


So now that I rambled a lot about one thing, I'll now ramble about the second most significant change to Robb Stark's story - the difference between his marriages in the book and in the show. There's of course been plenty of bitching and moaning about swapping Jeyne Westerling for Talisa, but the purpose of this next paragraph(s) is to examine how the *reasons* for his marriage to these different characters related something about *Robb*'s character. In the books, (another major change the series made) Bran and Rickon are *definitively* believed to be *dead* by all of Westeros. They are not merely missing, possibly hostages of Theon (whose capture is also known to Robb) in the Iron Islands, they are *dead* in the eyes of the public. This news reaches Robb while he is besieging The Crag, a castle in the Westerlands that is the seat of House Westerling. He storms the castle, taking a wound, and Jeyne Westerling treats his wounds; during this, Robb receives the news of his brothers' ""deaths,"" and Jeyne, ahem, ""comforts"" him in his grief. Book!Robb marries Jeyne because he took her maidenhead, and considers it to be the *honorable* thing to do - that is his stated motivation for breaking his betrothal to the Freys, and while it is implied that horny teenage hormonal lurv is also a reason, that is not outright stated. Robb chose to do the honorable thing in emulation of his father, putting Jeyne's honor above his own.


Show!Robb marries Talisa *entirely* out of the heat of passion. It's not out of honor for taking a lady's virginity while in the throes of grief, it's because he's in love and doesn't want to honor his duty. This *does* play into a running theme of the TV show that is more prominent in the show than in the books, that being that ""Love is the death of duty,"" as Maester Aemon so aptly put it in Season 1. Nevertheless, this does damage the audience's perception of Robb's character - he's not committing this blunder over a somewhat overblown sense of honor, he's doing it because he's a horny teenager.


Next, I'll go into the matter of Rickard Karstark. MINOR SPOILERS for 3x05 in this paragraph. This was actually not much of a change from the books - Robb's justification for [ASOS](#b ""killing Karstark in both books and show remain the same, that being a matter of justice and honor. However, I would like to give my own personal take on why killing Karstark was perhaps *right thing to do*. Yes, it caused the Karstark troops to up and leave [in the books it was just some, not all of them - Karstark dispatched the less loyal men to hunt down Jaime in the Riverlands before he was imprisoned], but overall, Robb HAD to do it. Why? No, not because it was the ""morally right"" or ""just"" or ""honorable"" thing to do. It was because Karstark *insulted his king to his face, and in front of several guards and nobles*. When confronted by his king, Karstark completely disrespected Robb, claiming [paraphrase] ""Leave me to the King. He wants to give a scolding...that's our King In The North...or should I say, the 'King Who Lost The North.'"" IIRC he said something similar in the books as well. This is an incredible insult, and Robb leaving this unpunished would have realistically been a significant loss of face - he's already in a *very* bad strategic situation, and the last thing he needs is his soldiers and bannermen questioning his authority. In real life, such an insult to one's liege lord likely would have resulted in severe punishment anyways - while perhaps not death, this is combined with Karstark *killing young boys who were prisoners of war*. While honor is not the reason Karstark *had* to die, this, in my personal opinion, is why Karstark *had* to die."")

EDIT: (Spoiler tags added to the above just to be safe)


Let's finally move on to the last series of rambling paragraphs I'll make on the topic today, that change being Robb's reasoning for going back to Walder Frey. Compared to the first two, this change is somewhat less significant or diminishing a change, but it is still somewhat damaging. In the show, Robb decides he's going to take the Westerlands outright, apparently in a moment of ""epiphany."" He resolves to return to Walder Frey to mend their alliance so he can replace House Karstark's lost levies with House Frey's (this despite Frey giving him a significant contribution in manpower when the alliance was first formed, in BOTH the books and the show). In the books, he returned to Walder Frey SOLELY to make amends for breaking his oath, which certainly was necessary due to Frey's significant contributions to the war effort and The Twins's strategic position on the Trident.


Why is this change diminishing to Robb's character? It makes the audience think, ""If Robb wasn't trying to take the Westerlands while he was there in Season 2, WHY WAS HE EVEN THERE? This only now just occurred to him? He must be really stupid."" Combine this with the first change described in this essay, and we have a double-whammy that makes Robb look really, really dumb. In the books, Robb addresses the fact that he would *never* have been able to take and hold Casterly Rock, much less the entirety of the Westerlands - as said before, he was only in the Westerlands to lure Tywin Lannister and his army westward in service to a greater strategic goal. In the books, his heading to The Crossing for Edmure's wedding was also convenient, because his plan after the Battle of the Blackwater was just to head back north and throw out the Greyjoys (who still at this point occupy Deepwood Motte, Torrhen's Square, and Moat Cailin - this is not mentioned in the show but is frequently mentioned in the books, and these are all significant castles, especially the latter). His strategic goal in the books is thus FAR more feasible than his goal in the show.


Well, that's that. I say again in conclusion that this is not me hating the show - I thoroughly enjoy the show, and for the most part enjoy the changes, great and small, that the writers/producers make from the books. I just hope that this really, *really* long and rambling essay helps non-bookreaders better understand Robb's character, as despite his expanded screentime on the show, it actually (perhaps inadvertently) displays him in a far more foolish light.

Wow, this actually went on for quite a bit longer than I had first anticipated. TL;DR - If I could've done it in fewer words, I would've.",21,67,False,self,,,,,

It's been great!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1emd2p/no_spoilers_i_started_reading_the_books_after/,sakerlygood,1368947181," I was a show watcher only, but then I started wanting more plot details and more info about the characters and such (in other words, I was super hooked), so I decided to buy the books. I am almost finished with AGOT so far and I gotta say... it's amazing to read the books *after* the show. I don't know what I was expecting, but certainly, not what I found. The show (or the first season, at least) is so like the book! It was like watching the series in my head, but with a lot more insight. I love the art of the show; all the costumes and locations and photography, so it was really easy to picture all that in my mind, but with words in more detail. Even the accent of the actors was easy to imagine as I was reading what the characters said! I love that GRRM really gets you into the head of the character he is showing you at the time, and it is something that the show vaguely portraits, so it's great to really understand what is going through the minds of certain personage, some things can really change how you perceive them. I am absolutely fascinated and can't wait to start with ACOK.
 I don't think I would be enjoying this as much as I am now if I read the books first. I would probably be bitching about how this or that is not *exactly* as I read it, or I would probably be upset about some casting choices, so I'm really happy that this happened the way it did. This way I can fuse together the show *and* the book, rather than *a* show and *a* book. Does anybody feel the same way as me?

TL;DR  I read the book *after* the show and it was awesome. I really recommend to non readers to start reading now, if you have finished with the show and you want to get *a lot* more.

Obviously most of this is speculation, but it's based on interpreting the text, so spoilers will be everywhere in the discussion, presumably.  I'm interested in what you guys think.

Ok, so GRRM is somewhat notorious for killing characters off: some people might think that this is to depart from standard fantasy, where only certain character archetypes are kill-able; some people might think this is to give more tension and attachment to the characters, as we actually worry that they might die.  I think both of these points are true, but I also think there's something else: Whenever a character dies, it's because their personality is at odds with the harsh, gritty, and above all *realistic* world that they live in.  

Imagine a personality continuum that runs from extremely honourable to extremely ruthless/cruel.  You can place characters in ASoIaF somewhere on the continuum; Ned Stark way on the honour side, Ramsay Snow on the cruel side.  Jaime started on the cruel side, but his character arc is bringing him closer to the middle, as he starts to weigh his desires against his personal sense of honour (Cersei against Brienne, so to speak.)  Tyrion started near the middle, but seems to be dancing dangerously close to the cruel side, depending on how you look at his character. 

Anyway, why is this significant?  Well, think of all the characters that you might say were ""important"" deaths; or better yet, those whose death was a surprise, to us and to the characters.  It wasn't terribly shocking when Hoster Tully, an old man, died in his sickbed, nor when Davos' sons died on the blackwater.  But the big deaths, the ones we talk about, Ned, Robb, Tywin, King Joffrey.  Even the mad king, dead before the story begins, died so spectacularly that we might want to look at what it means.  Almost every significant death can be placed at one extreme end of our honour continuum or the other, while the the characters in the middle keep on ticking.  

What killed Ned?  He was too honourable to take Littlefinger's advice, or to side with Renly.  Robb was killed because he made a mistake in falling in love, and he was too honourable to leave the woman or lie to the Freys.  Tywin was killed for the cruelties he committed against his son; Joffrey killed partially to prevent more cruelties, against his future wife and against the realm.

If you know your Aristotle, this isn't a new idea; he called it the Golden Mean, and said that all virtues were the sweet spot between two extremes.  GRRM seems to be saying something similar; in a world that justice is oft decided by the stronger sword arm, or the more cunning manipulator (that is, a world extremely like our own), too much honour makes you naive and blind, while too much cruelty eventually comes back to hurt you.

The theme of a middle ground, or Golden Mean, persists in other areas.  Sansa's character first sees King's Landing as an idealized fairy tale.  When everything comes crashing down on her, she sees the same city as a wholly harsh, terrible place, where the best a girl like her can do is survive.  The second view is just as wrong, however; by painting King's Landing as all bad, she blinds herself to the reality.  Highgarden becomes a perfect place for a time, so she can't see the ulterior motives of the Tyrell's proposed marriage, just as she can't see any of the good in her marriage to Tyrion.  Seeing a grey world as pure black is just as naive as seeing it as pure white.  All of Sansa's interactions have been shades of grey; the tortured goodness in Sandor Clegane, the hidden cruelty in the seemingly regal Joffrey, the greed beneath the innocence of Ser Dontos.

&gt;If half an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.

In the memorable quote, Melisandre seems to be denying my thesis, but that's exactly the point; her character sees the world in black and white, and we see her as a foreign, dangerous, yet seductive woman.  Also, as has been pointed out elsewhere, there's a point where Sam, in Craster's keep, finds a half-rotten onion, but simply cuts the rot away and eats the rest.  Sure, that might be a bit of a stretch, but do you think the besieged men on Dragonstone would have turned away Davos' onions if parts of them were black?

So we have a theory of extremes, and evidence that GRRM is against them.  How does this affect rest of the plot?  Well, we can make guesses as to which characters will live or die, perhaps a bit more accurately: 

Littlefinger vs. Varys, Littlefinger is definitely at the extreme end of ruthlessness, while Varys is either somewhat honourable, or a damn good liar, so of the schemers, Varys will probably come out on top.  

Dany's quest for the iron throne began in a naive extreme of justice and vengeance, but I think Quaithe's role is to steer her towards a more nuanced perspective.  In any case, if she brings blood and fire to Westeros simply because ""it is mine by right,"" she will probably fail.  

It's ambiguous as to whether or not Jon Snow survived the end of the last book, but why did he get stabbed?  He was being too honourable, doing justice by the wildlings, while blind to his brothers' growing discomfort--much like Mormont, the previous lord commander, who died trying to keep the peace for Craster's sake.  It's probably safe to assume that Jon is dead, then.

Drawing it back even further, we can see a big conflict brewing on the horizon: Melisandre/Stannis/R'hllor against the Great Other (and, perhaps, Bran Stark as its champion).  Personally, I think this will have to be the final set piece in the series; I can't see any other climax that has been built up so well, or anything that matches the scale.  Obviously the exact nature of the conflict will be hard to predict--personally, I think Davos will be Azor Ahai, after he tempers Lightbringer in the heart of the one he loves best...--but I think we can predict the outcome: both extremes fall, as a result of the machinations of the people that stand in the middle. Varys, Illyrio,  Tyrion, Dany, Jaime, Arianne Martell; any, all or none of them could be the final saviors, as long as those in the extremes fall.

There's my interpretation, anyway.  Hopefully we get some good discussion.

tl;dr **Characters die if they're too one-sided in terms of alignment.  The story will end with both grand extremes falling to those in the middle.**",21,45,False,self,,,,,

In the book, since he does not yet have an heir, he makes Jon Snow his legal heir and sends Maege Mormont and Garbart Glover to the crags to find Howland Reed.  Does this mean that since he will have a child, he won't have a reason to make Jon his heir?

So, I'm going to leave this subreddit, and only come back when I'm up to date. 

Okay.I'm already in love with this show, and I can tell I'll watch every episode :)
So, I've watched episode one, here are my views.

PROS - Lots of tits. Seriously.And sex everywhere.
Cute wolf babies.Absolutely adorable, and I loved the part where they're like ""the runt of the litter. He's yours!"" I can tell that he'll rise above everyone else, and be a total badass, or he'll die a horrible death.
This may be offensive to you, but it's very similar to skyrim.Cold north, main city to the south, ancient threat coming back.Don't get me wrong, I love this - which is why it's in the pro section.

CONS - Uhhh...very grim at the start, was a slight turn off, but it set the tone well.
Ia, aya, however her name Is spelt - what the fuck? The king comes, and you don a retarded helmet and show up late? Wow...food fight in an important meal? You are so annoying...she reminds me of Carl from the walking dead, so I just hope she matures like him.
Also, I hope the kid isn't dead...and why would she still sleep with you if she watched you kill a kid? Good god.

Anyway, what an amazing show! I'll try and stay spoiler free, and continue the journey!",24,0,False,self,,,,,

-------------------

*Taps microphone*

OK, are the TV-only fans gone? Good. We can talk safely now.

**NAME**

Operation WaW (**W**eeping **a**nd **W**ailing)

**GOAL**

Film nonreaders' reactions to episode nine, ""The Rains of Castamere"", airing in the US on Sunday, 2 June 2013.^1 In other words, RW. Reactions to other cool events are great, too, but RW is the priority.

^1 The show is skipping Memorial Day weekend.

**REASON**

We've all seen, and laughed our heads off at, the reaction videos of people who haven't read ASoIaF before watching *Game of Thrones*. Probably the most famous is OtakuASSEMBLE's [freakout to Ned's beheading](http://youtu.be/owf6D2vfZqM). Others

* [cry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUcuTJnv1JE)
* [are in denial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn2J0-I4UNE)
* shout ""[Whaaaat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNIyzN9eDz0)""
* [cry again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_iHL3m1NzM)
* [gasp with their jaws dropped open](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_FTFFZoDfU), plus a bonus whispered confession
* shout ""[What the hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqz8iVbqk0U)""
* repeatedly shout ""[What the hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSEm5ZMdc_0)""
* denounce it as ""[the worst show ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUmSO5vzuG8)""
* [jump back in shock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDE2uOWuG4) (hat tip to /u/octarino)
* or merely plan to [punch Jack Gleeson in the face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D6vEtv1HBU).

Other dramatic moments have elicited similar reactions. Examples include

* The Mountain that Rides [decapitating his horse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuxRX5VUaI8)
* [Dany's dragons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGVD8E8iWmE)
* [Melisandre's shadow baby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alp4sRu_HWw)
* [Jaime Lannister losing a hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPBBSZoXfw)
* the [death of Jeor Mormont](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qti1Dt-9tAU)
* and Dany's [sacking of Astapor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwme0LJIHwI).

RW, if done right, will be more shocking than anything before it on the show. It will be an atom bomb dropped on the audience. The only equivalent examples I can think of have become legends of television history: [The ending of *The Prisoner*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-uQ84-waV0), [Colonel Blake's death on *MASH*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g450eyrN7Pg), and [Bobby Ewing in the shower on *Dallas*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCEjeTb1rrs). It is our job, as those who know what is coming, to document it for history and for laughs. OK, mostly for laughs.

**DETAILS**

Suggestions on how to make your own reaction video:

* One way is to secretly film the reactions. As seen in several of the above videos, you could use darkness and perspective to hide the camera.
* Another way is to openly film the audience watching all of the episodes, start to finish. While secret filming is preferable to maximize the genuineness of the shocked reactions, an advantage of this method is that RW won't be the only shocking/surprising event this season (Lord Mormont's death, Tyrion marrying Sansa, Dany's ""Dracarys"" with her Unsullied, Jaime losing his hand, Jaime and Brienne in the bear pit, Hound vs. Beric), and reaction videos for all are very welcome along with the ones for RW. If asked why by non-readers, say that /r/gameofthrones has organized ""Operation **W**atching **a**ll **W**atchers"" to document fan reactions to the show. Tell them that people enjoy watching such reaction videos, which is 100% true.
* Do **not** give any indication that E09, or the season as a whole, is different from the others. Don't say even vague stuff like ""Man, people are going to go nuts after episode 9!"" or ""Oh boy, watchers are in for a crazy season!"" This does not mean that if asked you need to deny that something big will happen in the episode; after two seasons of big events in the ninth episode, no one will believe you. Just be vague as much as possible. If pressed, say that there's a wedding; as the season progresses viewers will become aware of the Tyrion-Sansa, Roslyn-Edmure, and Joffrey-Margaery relationships, so this won't tell them anything new.
* Put [WaW] in the title of videos you upload to YouTube. I will create a new thread right after the episode ends for Operation WaW participants to post videos as replies, to share the laughter and tears far and wide. Will flying remote controls break TVs? Will punches be thrown? We can only hope.

**CONCLUSION**

Bookmark this post, or save it in RES. I will update here as necessary. I also ask you to vote this thread up; as a selfpost I don't get karma.

EDIT: The first three [reaction videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtlQ1rWcEf0) that I am aware of to the print version of RW, complete with [book throwing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1pucB8qlI) and [suicide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omZBpQRL-qs)! A preview of future delights? ([Hitler reacted badly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKqF8lg_M7A) to it, too.) Plus, a [bonus reaction photograph](http://robbstarkalypse.tumblr.com/image/44418759127)!

EDIT 3: /u/HighOrdinator has a truly evil idea: ""I propose everyone change to Bolton and Frey Flair after the event, then we sing praises about our glorious liege lords who slew the usurper."" /u/PentagramJ2 suggests Lannister flair as another possibility.

(NB - This is a repost of [my initial announcement of Operation WaW](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1be2er/asoss3_spoilers_shocking_s3_events_that_the/) at the start of season 3, with older comments.)

-----------------
**FINAL EDIT**: The [post for reaction videos is up](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1fjyxm/s3e09_operation_waw_reaction_videos_for_the/)! Upvote it for visibility!

Also, even after the episode airs, **don't reveal anything from the books the episode has not**. It's very possible that the episode will 1) not show what happens to Grey Wind and Robb's bodies, and 2) leave Arya's fate uncertain. Keep secret what is still secret!

I think splitting the 3rd book *(A Storm of Swords)* into 2 seasons was a wise move *(they could of probably also split ""A Clash of Kings"" into 2 seasons but there isn't a lot that can be done about that now.)*



""A Feast for Crows"" &amp; ""A Dance with Dragons"" should only have a season each. They have a lot of filler in them and can easily be fit into a single season each. Stretching these out to long will bore the viewers. A single season each should be more then enough.



By the end of season 6 *(Book 5 ""A Dance with Dragons"")* George R. R. Martin *should* have ""The Winds of Winter"" done. But I can't see ***any*** chance of ""A Dream of Spring"" being ready in time for the shows end *(unless HBO decide to have a very long hiatuses between seasons.)*



This leaves 2 options:



1) End the show with ""The Winds of Winter"", then finish everything up with a trilogy of 3hr long movies.



The problem with this is George R. R. Martin may take a long time to finish ""A Dream of Spring"" and by time the book is finished [actors like](#s ""Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner"") maybe to old to play their parts anymore.



2) let David Benioff and D.B. Weiss write their own ending with George R. R. Martin's feedback.



We are starting to see scenes in the show that are not in the books. This will start a domino effect the further we advance into the story. With all these little changes being made *(plus the 3rd book being stretched over 2 seasons)*  the story will divert slightly away from the original *(or have its own parallel story separate from the books)*. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are going to have to use their creative license to be able to keep the overarching story coherent with the changes/additions that have been made.



I am perfectly fine with the changes that have been made so far. I honestly believe the essence of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is in very good hands and trust the decisions the show creators are making.



So letting David Benioff and D.B. Weiss end the show how they feel fit *(with George R. R. Martin guidance)* may not be a bad thing. Especially if they work on a parallel story with George R. R. Martin that isn't covered in the books.



So how many seasons?



6 seasons if there isn't any new material to work with from GRRM and let David Benioff and D.B. Weiss decide how to end it.



If ""The Winds of Winter"" is finished in time and depending on how epic it is, 7 or 8 seasons. Then turn the last book into a Movie Trilogy and hope the actors aren't to old to play their parts.",102,54,False,self,,,,,

Now we see them move slowly, we don't get to see their battles (Fist of the First Men), they haven't killed anyone we care about and in the first one-on-one stand-off, we find out how to kill them (quite easily, if you have the right materials, it turns out) by the weakest character in the show.

I'm guessing they'll play a bigger role in the long game (please don't post spoilers), but at this point I feel no fear for them the way I did back in season 1.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

This week I want to build off something that was established in this past weeks episode, and that is the concept of a sellsword company.  Now we've been introduced to sellswords in the show already, most notably through the character of Bronn.  As you know sellswords are freelancers or mercenaries not sworn to any house or person who make a living fighting for the person who will pay them the most.  As they fight for the larger payout instead of honor or glory for this person or that person their reputation is fickle at best, and are known to turn tail or switch alliances should the other guy have a larger wallet.  Their larger counterparts, sellsword companies are for the most part the same, but on a larger scale, groups of sellswords united together as a small army offering their services to the highest bidder, and with the same ill repute as their individual counterparts.  Most sellswords get work by going through these companies, not the individual route such as Bronn.  These companies once bought sign a contract with the city or person they will serve, and they are that person's men... Though as we will cover some sellsword companies take their contracts more seriously than others.

I hope to, in this post, cover several of the larger sellsword companies present in the ASOIAF/GoT universe, largely go into detail in the book to TV difference up to we're in the show, a bit about the organizational structure, and offer a bit of history on these organizations as well, so lets get started.

(Thanks in advance to the Mercenary page at the Wiki of Ice and Fire that helped me with a lot of the finer details)

- Minor Companies (Company of the Cat, Ragged Standard,Windblown, Maiden's Men, Long Lances)

Of the several sellsword companies that appear in the books these few are the least mentioned and have the least appearance in the books, there is very little elaborate on as there is not too much info to be had for them.  This however leaves me the opportunity to discuss where most of these companies serve.  In the show and in the books fully fledged sellsword companies have, and have had little presence in Westeros and it's history.  As Westeros, full of lords, and bannermen, each with thousands of sworn men to command at wartime means that there is little need for the hiring of sellswords; sure several lords have padded their numbers with individual sellswords before, but the taking on of full companies is just not needed.  However in the many-city states of Essos, where you cannot just ""call your banners"" during times of war, sellsword companies thrive.  It's in the Free Cities, and in the cities of Slaver's Bay where almost if not all theses companies were founded and find gainful employment, such as these in particular.  The hiring of sellsword are so common in Essos that if two cities go to war that it is likely that it will pit one sellsword company against another... As is the case with the Company of the Cat and the Windblown, who have a long standing rivalry between each other. ( Thanks to The Wiki of Ice and Fire for some of the little info I could provide on these few groups)

- The Brave Companions (aka The Bloody Mummers)

We continue with an outfit cut for the show entirely, but there are some major book to screen differences to mention and they play a big part in books 2 and 3 so lets get them out of the way next.  The Brave Companions are a small company based from the free city of Qohor.  Comprised of brutal outcasts as opposed to professional soldiers, and behave more like a rabble with absolutely no discipline, as opposed to the more organized companies we'll get to in a bit .  Their leader is a man named Vargo Hoat.  Of all the sellsword companies, the Brave Companions are the only ones to have any big part to play in Westeros this far into the story.  In the books they were bought and brought to Westeros by Tywin Lannister, and to help the cause of the crown, by terrorizing the Riverlands.  Arya encounters the outfit in book 2 when she arrives at Harrenhall while Tywin is stationed there.  It's noteworthy that Rorge, Biter, and Jaqen h'ghar join the Brave Companions at this point in the books (in the show they are seen as just Lannister men).  The Brave Companions betray the Lannisters and turn tides for Roose Bolton when Tywin leaves Harrenhall, by helping Arya freeing the northern prisoners and killing most of the remaining Lannister garrison. 

In book ASOS, we see the Brave Companions again when they take captive Jaime and Brienne in the Riverlands, under the employee of Roose Bolton.  It is the Brave Companions (a Dothraki named Zollo to be specific) who takes Jaime's hand.  When Roose leaves Harrenhall for Edmure Tully's wedding he leaves the castle under the command of Vargo Hoat..  Now as viewers know this role has been filled by Locke and sever other Bolton men in the show, and as with the books it seems that Locke is now in charge at Harrenhall, so I would imagine his story going forward to be relatively the same, but we shall see.

- The Golden Company

Of all the sellsword companies in GRRM's world, no other outfit holds the high reputation and prestige as the Golden Company.  This highly disciplined outfit is known for never having broken a contract in its entire history.  They are also the most expensive of any sellsword company.   They were founded by Aegor Rivers (aka Bittersteel) after the Blackfyre rebellion.  As he fought for his half-brother Daemon in his failed rebellion,
Bittersteel was forced to flee with his brother's children across the narrow sea.  Bittersteel fought with a couple of sellsword companies before founding his own.  The Golden Company was for a stint the staging of a few more attempts at the Iron Throne by the descendants of Daemon Blackfyre, the most notable of which was the War of the Ninepenny Kings, when Maelys the Monstrous, the last of the Blackfyres and leader of the Golden Company was killed by Barristain Selmy, after a campaign that started in the free cities and made its way though the stepstones, during the reign of king Aegon V. It is rumored that The Golden Company still has possession of the ancient Targaryen sword Blackfyre.  They are currently in the service of the free city of Myr.

- The Stormcrows

Not much backstory here, but a big book-show difference.  In ASOS as in the show, Danerys finds Yunkai being guarded by sellswords and meets with the representatives to try and win them to her side.  It's here where she meets Daario Naharis, a Captain of the Stormcrows.  And as the show depicts he turns on his fellow captains bringing Dany their heads and breaking the Stormcrow's contract with Yunkai to an end..however the Stormcrows have been dropped from the show and merged with another sellsword company, that would be the....

- Second Sons 

As the show depicted Dany encounters the Second Sons as the defenders of Yunkai. (along with the Stormcrows in the books), and as the show depicts Dany treats with their leader, Mero, the Titan's Bastard.  As the show also depicts the meeting with Mero dosent go particularly well with Mero, Dany gives the Second Sons a fair amount of wine to Mero to ponder Dany's terms when he departs, this is all from the books.  However as I mentioned in the previous section it seems that the Stormcrows have been combined with the Second Sons, and in the show Daario kills his other two captains (which presumably includes Mero), thus winning the Second Sons to Dany's cause..  While in the books while Daario has killed his fellow two captains and won the Stormcrows for Dany, the Second Sons remain opposed to her at this point, with a much-alive Mero..  So the following weeks should interest even the reader as to how this change plays out.  

Now that I've got the book to TV difference out of the way a few points on the Second Sons.  They are one of the largest, by numbers, and one of the oldest companies in existence, who's founding and deeds date back to the time of the Doom in Valyria.  They have a good habit keeping records of every person who has ever served with them in large volumes of books that details when they served and where they've fought, while they are based and operate in the free cites, several Westerosi people have been among their ranks such as the aforementioned Bittersteel who served before founding the Golden Company, other names from large Westerosi houses such as Stark, and Martell can be found in their records.  In recent times, under the command of Mero, who's savagery is so vile it has soured the name and reputation of the Second Sons to the point where they're un-employable.  This reputation is even widely known in Westeros.  Yunkai must have been desperate to hire them after learning of Astapor and finding out the Mother of Dragons was on her way...


Well, that's it for this week.  There is still a lot more detail in these groups that you could go into, and if anyone wants to elaborate further (or correct where I might have gotten something wrong) please do so in the comments, though don't extended beyond where the show is now outside of a spoiler tag.   Hope you enjoyed, and until next time, have a week!

3 dragons (fire breathing beasts. still young)

4 Dothrakis (gifted mounted soldiers)
Fixed - apparently little are left.

2000 The second suns (mounted ex-sellswords)

I've just started working on a GoT based Text Based Adventure. It will contain a number of characters. The first version will only contain the events in aGoT, but more events will be added in later versions, if it's popular enough.

Does this sound like something you'd like?

Also, so far I am including 5 characters: Dany, Robb, Tyrion, Joffrey and Jon. I only want to do 5 in the first version, so are there any changes you'd like to make to those 5?

I haven't read ADWD and who knows that the last 2 books will be like. But my understanding is they will scrunch a lot of AFFC into season 4 of the show, maybe even all of it. This is mostly smart as a business decision. AFFC has a lot of history/introductions and small plays that are hard to translate to a big screen. Most show watchers dont want to watch Sam Tarly throwing up on a boat for 1/10th of the season.

Also realize the showmakers can't spend an entire season away from Tyrion/Stannis/Dany/Bran/Jon Snow, etc. These are TV favorites as well as book favorites and even half a season without them would TANK the ratings.

As such it's not a bad idea, as long as the include many of the important plot points and major characters, they can definitely fit AFFC in with the last 25% of ASOS in season 4, and still leave everyone as satisfied as usual. Thus giving full seasons for each of the next books!

So just to freshen your memory, [in episode 8](#s ""Sam and Gilly find temporary shelter next to a weirwood tree with the carved face.  Crows settle into the tree - not necessarily the three eyed warging crows, but juts tons of them - and scream things up when a White Walker comes out of the woods.  Sam kills the Walker using Dragon Glass and the crows all fly to attack him."")

I don't understand a few things.

The show has been building up the religion of R'hllor as a legitimate one in the sense that we've seen Melisandre work her magic and that the ultimate prophecy of fire battling ice is all nicely coming together. So where do the other religions fit in at all?  Is R'hllor related to the Old Religion?  Because the weirwood tree did not protect Sam and Gilly but it just sits inert. The Faith of the Seven seems increasingly irrelevant.

Secondly, what is important about the crows?

Here you can learn some extra facts from the books that didn't make it to the show. Some paragraphs may include alternative events that did not happen in the show, but I wouldn't consider that a spoiler, really.

For the new guys interested in catching up with previous followups (which I heavily recommend), just check out [my submissions](http://www.reddit.com/user/lukeatlook/submitted/), shouldn't contain much more than that.

**TL;DR: Spoiler-free content! Wall of text! Book trivia! Cheesy humour! Weird selection of quotes!**

* As usual, the episode's title may be interpreted in more that just one way: Tyrion, Sandor and Stannis are the titular ""second sons"", and so is Samwell in the eyes in his father.

=====

**Road Trippin'**

&gt; ""Go on, hit me. Hit me hard"" - Sandor Clegane in a vagye Firefly reference

* Blackwater Rush is the river that Melisandre sailed through with Gendry in the last episode, Blackwater Bay is its estuary. Red Fork is part of the other river system, the Trident. This is where years ago Robert Baratheon battled Rhaegar Targaryen.

* Robb took his entire army with him. His uncle's wedding is going to be a huge tent party. Since Edmure is the lord of the Riverlands, everyone in the country is concerned about the wedding.

**My Eyes Are Up Here**

&gt; ""I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war"" - Daenerys Targaryen, phrasing in a polite way that she's about to have everyone and everything that stands in her way slaughtered, burned or gelded

* Braavos, the city Mero (also: Syrio Forrel, Jaquen H'gar) is from is located in the northwest corner of Essos: north of Pentos, east of Eyrie. That is quite far away.

* Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh (southern part of the Free Cities, so far west from Yunkai directly, east from King's Landing) and according to the custom there, he dyes his hair blue... in the books. He would look like [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md6csl8ab51ru00pmo1_500.jpg), which is apparently too silly for TV. There appears to be a man with blue hair walking behind Daario as he says about the two pleasures gods give to a man.

* Great wall of text about the sellsword companies may be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ep5k2/asoss03e08_context_for_nonreaders_sellsword/) (weekly post by /u/GRVrush2112). Mercenaries are a huge thing in Essos.

* Fun fact: ""Sheath"" is the main term for ""vagina"" in Polish dictionary.

* 19 languages might seem a lot, but many of them are Valyrian dialects of Free Cities. It's almost like with Latin, Italian and French. One language worth mentioning as quite different is Ghiscari, the speak of the old empire that Valyria conquered.

**This Sucks**

&gt; ""Fuck me"" - Davos Seaworth, picking the worst possible book to learn to read from

* Davos is not dyslexic. He's *illiterate*. That used to be a common thing.

* You might have noticed that book readers generally like Stannis; I would say more than the show one deserves to be liked. Let's just say that the book Stannis is a little bit different. Of course the big picture is the same: he's trying to be the good guy, but he sees that he cannot win by being a good guy alone - so he agrees on using Melisandre's power, and then *hates himself for it*. What's interesting is that book Melisandre is *less* likable than the show one.

* Note how Melisandre performs some magic to prove herself to Davos, not Stannis. She knows that Davos is Stannis's consinence. If those two ever agreed on something...

* Book equivalent of Gendry, Edric Storm, was much younger and became a close friend to Shireen, which was one of the main incentives for Stannis to refrain from hurting him.

* The vision Stannis saw occured back in the finale of Season 2 and it was most likely the battle at the Fist of the First Men (the one we did not get to).

* The Silent Sisters who Melisandre mentions have been seen in the show many times. They are the women taking care of the dead with seven-pointed stars above their heads.

**Runaway Bride Wannabe**

&gt; ""But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute"" - Olenna Tyrell (Redwyne), proceeding to be the only person having fun in the commotion

* That monologue Cersei gave is of utmost importance if you want to understand all the nuances right away instead of on second screening of the whole series. I've already explained the meaning of *Rains of Castamere* many times in my previous followups (for the first time in ""Blackwater"", I suppose) and Cersei already did half of the job, so let's leave it here.

* There's a nice parallel between the people around Sansa who spoke in this episode and the Seven: Tywin - Father, Cersei - Mother, Loras - Warrior, Margaery - Maiden, Tyrion - Smith (in the books he makes all the smiths in King's Landing forge a huge badass mofo chain to lock Stannis's fleet in Blackwater Bay), Olenna - Crone and Joffrey - Stranger (wicked aspect of death). Notice how everyone from the KL main cast was there as well - Pycelle, Varys, Bronn, even Podrick.

* The wedding ritual in a sept reflects a girl's transition from the protection of Maiden to Mother: the ceremony occurs between the statues of Father and Mother. Earlier in the book Sansa attends prayers to Maiden for maidens only and Margaery shows uo as well, showing out to the common folk that Renly did not consume the marriage.

* Joffrey sees nothing wrong in raping Sansa as he says his father had a lot of whores. As I mentioned before, him carrying over her father's rights is why Lannisters could decide Sansa's hand in marriage in the first place.

* There's a whole nude scene we're missing out, but it lacks a big part of it: book Tyrion is disfigured, his body is wicked and all his limbs are twisted. Sansa describes his cock as the only thing in his body that is straight. It wouldn't have as much impact with the handsome TV Tyrion and Sansa who looks nothing like 14, making the whole ""she's too young for this"" absolutely unbelievable.

* The traditional bedding ceremony that Joffrey tried to initiate consists of all women stripping the groom, all men stripping the bride and carrying both naked to their bed. As far as I recall, similar custom persisted/persists for a long time in some Balkan countries, where the families escort the newly wed to their room (just not naked) and then stay behind their door, shouting and singing to participate in their wedding night. The bloodied sheets are shown and burned in the morning, proving that the bride was a maiden and the marriage has been consumed.

**Sam And Gilly Meet An Older Gentleman**

&gt; ""YOU LEFT THE DAGGER YOU FUCKING IDIOT"" - Everyone

* The dagger shatters in the books, so no harm done.

* Crows are actually part of another powerful scene that might or might not get postponed to another season. Don't seek the connection here.

* Wildling women don't name their children too early, as it's not uncommon for them to not survive infancy. Gilly did not have much contact with wildlings, but Craster's mother was one.

* ""Sam the Slayer"", as the scene is called by readers, occured much earlier in ASOS and had many Night's Watch witnesses. The show version might have a different impact on Sam's character - looking forward to that.

* **White Walkers are not killed by fire** as far as we know. It was Wights (zombies), not the Others (zombiemakers) that are vulnerable to fire and Valyrian steel.

I understand that this is a way for them to appease the Lord of Light and bring death down on the three people that they named. The thing I am having trouble with is what their motivations are for choosing the three people that they did?

* Joffrey is an obvious one; he sits on the throne that Stannis believes is rightfully his.

* Robb Stark controls the North and a large army with it. I don't see why Stannis sees Robb as a threat; I would think that House Stark and Baratheon would still be on good terms. (As long as you aren't including Cersei and Joffrey as part of House Baratheon, which they certainly don't seem to)

* The one that really confuses me is Balon Greyjoy. He just seems to be a thorn in the North's side and not really a major player. I realize that the Iron Islands have a formidable navy, but I don't see how they would affect Stannis in any way. I suppose they could still be on bad terms because of Baylon's rebellion? 

Will Stannis's motivation become more clear in the coming episodes or am I missing something?",3,1,False,default,,,,,

Here you can learn some extra facts from the books that didn't make it to the show. Some paragraphs may include alternative events that did not happen in the show, so technically it's book spoilers, but that's the whole point of it.

For the new guys interested in catching up with previous followups (which I heavily recommend), just check out [my submissions](http://www.reddit.com/user/lukeatlook/submitted/), shouldn't contain much more than that.

**TL;DR: Spoiler-free content! Wall of text! Book trivia! Cheesy humour! Weird selection of quotes!**

* As usual, the episode's title may be interpreted in more that just one way: Tyrion, Sandor and Stannis are the titular ""second sons"", and so is Samwell in the eyes in his father.

=====

**Road Trippin'**

&gt; ""Go on, hit me. Hit me hard"" - Sandor Clegane in a vagye Firefly reference

* Blackwater Rush is the river that Melisandre sailed through with Gendry in the last episode, Blackwater Bay is its estuary. Red Fork is part of the other river system, the Trident. This is where years ago Robert Baratheon battled Rhaegar Targaryen.

* Robb took his entire army with him. His uncle's wedding is going to be a huge tent party. Since Edmure is the lord of the Riverlands, everyone in the country is concerned about the wedding.

**My Eyes Are Up Here**

&gt; ""I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war"" - Daenerys Targaryen, phrasing in a polite way that she's about to have everyone and everything that stands in her way slaughtered, burned or gelded

* Braavos, the city Mero (also: Syrio Forrel, Jaqen H'gar) came from is located in the northwest corner of Essos: north of Pentos, east of Eyrie. That is quite far away.

* Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh (southern part of the Free Cities, so far west from Yunkai directly, east from King's Landing) and according to the custom there, he dyes his hair blue... in the books. He would look like [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md6csl8ab51ru00pmo1_500.jpg), which is apparently too silly for TV. There appears to be a man with blue hair walking behind Daario as he says about the two pleasures gods give to a man.

* Great wall of text about the sellsword companies may be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ep5k2/asoss03e08_context_for_nonreaders_sellsword/) (weekly post by /u/GRVrush2112). Mercenaries are a huge thing in Essos.

* Fun fact: ""Sheath"" (""pochwa"") is the main term for ""vagina"" in Polish dictionary, as ""vagina"" is Latin for ""sheath"".

* 19 languages might seem a lot, but many of them are Valyrian dialects of Free Cities. It's almost like with Latin, Italian and French. One language worth mentioning as quite different is Ghiscari, the speak of the old empire that Valyria conquered.

**This Sucks**

&gt; ""Fuck me"" - Davos Seaworth, picking the worst possible book to learn to read from

* Davos is not dyslexic. He's *illiterate*. That used to be a common thing.

* You might have noticed that book readers generally like Stannis; I would say more than the show one deserves to be liked. Let's just say that the book Stannis is a little bit different. Of course the big picture is the same: he's trying to be the good guy, but he sees that he cannot win by being a good guy alone - so he agrees on using Melisandre's power, and then *hates himself for it*. What's interesting is that book Melisandre is *less* likable than the show one.

* Note how Melisandre performs some magic to prove herself to Davos, not Stannis. She knows that Davos is Stannis's conscience, see this caption from another redditor: [a conflicted man vs a certain man](http://imgur.com/a/CaqoX).
 
* Book equivalent of Gendry, Edric Storm, was much younger and became a close friend to Shireen, which was one of the reasons for Stannis to wonder if sacrifising him is the right thing to do.

* The vision Stannis saw occured back in the finale of Season 2 and it was most likely the battle at the Fist of the First Men (the one we did not get to). Book Melisandre claims there are *two* gods: R'hllor, Lord of Light, and The One That Shall Not Be Named, The Great Other. It seems plausible that this is connected to the titular conflict of Ice and Fire and The Great Other, god of death, may be connected to The Others (White Walkers).

* The Silent Sisters who Melisandre mentions have been seen in the show many times. They are the women taking care of the dead with seven-pointed stars above their heads.

**Runaway Bride Wannabe**

&gt; ""But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute"" - Olenna Tyrell (Redwyne), proceeding to be the only person having fun in the commotion

* That monologue Cersei gave is of utmost importance if you want to understand all the nuances right away instead of on second screening of the whole series. I've already explained the meaning of *Rains of Castamere* many times in my previous followups (for the first time in ""Blackwater"", I suppose) and Cersei already did half of the job, so let's leave it here.

* There's a nice parallel between the people around Sansa who spoke in this episode and the Seven: Tywin - Father, Cersei - Mother, Loras - Warrior, Margaery - Maiden, Tyrion - Smith (in the books he makes all the smiths in King's Landing forge a huge badass mofo chain to lock Stannis's fleet in Blackwater Bay), Olenna - Crone and Joffrey - Stranger (wicked aspect of death). Notice how everyone from the KL main cast was there as well - Pycelle, Varys, Bronn, even Podrick.

* The wedding ritual in a sept reflects a girl's transition from the protection of Maiden to Mother: the ceremony occurs between the statues of Father and Mother. Earlier in the book Sansa attends prayers to Maiden for maidens only and Margaery shows uo as well, showing out to the common folk that Renly did not consummated the marriage.

* Joffrey sees nothing wrong in raping Sansa as he says his father had a lot of whores. As I mentioned before, him carrying over her father's rights is why Lannisters could decide Sansa's hand in marriage in the first place.

* There's a whole nude scene we're missing out, but it lacks a big part of it: book Tyrion is disfigured, his body is wicked and all his limbs are twisted. Sansa describes his cock as the only thing in his body that is straight. It wouldn't have as much impact with the handsome TV Tyrion and Sansa who looks nothing like 14, making the whole ""she's too young for this"" absolutely unbelievable. The result was the same, though: the marriage has not been consumated.

* The traditional bedding ceremony that Joffrey tried to initiate consists of all women stripping the groom, all men stripping the bride and carrying both naked to their bed. As far as I recall, similar custom persisted/persists for a long time in some Balkan countries, where the families escort the newly wed to their room (just not naked) and then stay behind their door, shouting and singing to participate in their wedding night. The bloodied sheets are shown and burned in the morning, proving that the bride was a maiden and the marriage has been consummated.

**Sam And Gilly Meet An Older Gentleman**

&gt; ""YOU LEFT THE DAGGER YOU FUCKING IDIOT"" - Everyone

* The dagger shatters in the books, so no harm done. There was much more of it in the package anyway.

* Crows are actually part of another powerful scene that might or might not get postponed to another season. Don't seek the connection between the birds and the Others here.

* Wildling women don't name their children too early, as it's not uncommon for them to not survive infancy. Gilly did not have much contact with wildlings, but Craster's mother was one of them.

* ""Sam the Slayer"", as the scene is called by readers, occured much earlier in ASOS and had Night's Watch witnesses. The show version might have a different impact on Sam's character - looking forward to that.

* **White Walkers are probably not killed by fire** or any other means other than obsidian, as far as we know by now. It was Wights (blue-eyed zombies), not the Others (iceman zombiemakers) that are vulnerable to fire.

=====

That's it! Feel free to correct me or ask my fellow readers for more details; I'll reply and add corrections in the morning. Next week we'll have a general post summing up most of the thing missing out from the show that you should keep in mind while watching the last two episodes.",403,1047,False,self,,,,,

In the final scene when the ravens are above Sam and Gilly, cawing, it's quite obvious that they're drawing the white walker towards them.

What may not be obvious is that this is a behaviour that happens quite often in the real world, where a corvid (crow, raven, jay etc) will draw a predator towards its prey. Once the predator has made the kill &amp; had its feed, the corvids will then feed on the leftovers. Corvids are well-known to use wolves, mountain lions and even humans in this technique. Apparently now they also use white walkers. 

Even having not read the books, I could tell as soon as the second raven turned up what was going to happen, and I thought it was a great inclusion in that scene. 

I just thought people would find it cool that the role of the ravens in this scene wasn't actually part of the fantasy, but actually part of that species' natural behaviour. ",112,582,False,self,,,,,

(SPOILERS BELOW)

Why did they mash up the Second Sons and the Stormcrows? In the book, the Second Sons are led by Mero, the Titan's Bastard, with his lieutenant being Brown Ben Plum. Ben is one of my favorite characters in the book, but he was absent from last night's episode, which really bummed me out.

Also, Daario Naharis is one of the three captains of the Stormcrows. They got the part about him killing the other two captains to swear loyalty to Dany correct, but why didn't they just call themselves the Stormcrows? And they had Mero as one of these guys?

It was just so mashed up and weird for me. I really hope they're not writing Brown Ben out of the series because he's seriously a great character. He seems a little too important to completely exclude. Does anyone else have concerns with how they're handling this stuff in Yunkai with the free companies?",11,1,False,self,,,,,

My question is, do you think I would miss out on anything by skipping the first book? I hear from some people that book is pretty much identical to the show, but others say that I would be missing out on some of the character development for the next books.

When she killed Renly, there was a direct chain of cause and effect between her spell and his death. We these three, not at all. All of those deaths were part of plots made by other characters.

My theory is that there was no spell to kill them. She saw their deaths in her fire visions. She acted out her ruse because she knew there would be opposition about a sacrifice of king's blood. She did this to remove doubts to it's potency.

Also, in ADWD, it's revealed that she does carry vials of various potions and powders in her robes to add some flair to her displays and spells, so it doesn't seem at all out of character for her to do this sort of thing.

It's not unlike if Thoros of Myr murder Beric Dondarrion because he saw a better deal somewhere. And that would be despicable, no? 

But because he joins ""our"" sider are his actions ok? And we should feel anything about how he swears loyalty now? 

**I guess that in the books this gets a better explanation**, and just because the show is beautifully fast paced plot wise, they didn't have time to make it have more sense. That's why I ask here. 

Btw, quick question: What happened with the big Dothraki army that Daenerys was supposed to get out of the marriage with Drogo?

Will we ever hear the name ""Sam the Slayer"" and how is Sam going to prove anyone that dragonglass is what the White Walkers are vurnable to. (Which is quite important to know, since Stannis starts minning dragonglass from Dragonstone to prepare his war against the Walkers).

It seems to me that a lot of people who watch one episode of the tv series cannot get into it. A friend who had never watched GoT, but heard of it, recently watched the most recent episode (S3E8) and commented that it was badly written. She said nothing happened apart from 'someone getting leeches on his dick' and that she doesn't understand how anyone can like it as it apparently 'has no climax' to each episode.

My thoughts were first very defensive as I love this show, but it made me think that could this be because she did not know the characters/plots and didn't see the significance of everything? Or maybe this particular episode wasn't as eventful (although I thought it was). Perhaps she is just arrogant.

I am very often seeing alot of confusion from people regarding the difference between these two creatures. 

Lets begin with the **White Walkers**, in the books referred to as **the Others**. They are a different people than humans, tall, scary, silent, voices like cracking ice, wielding swords of crystal and armor glittering like ice. In the show, they do not seem to have much armor (they don't really need it anyway).[Book version](http://i.imgur.com/6OL2MA5.jpg), [Show version](http://i.imgur.com/fCG4Urm.jpg) They are incredibly strong, only comes at night when it's cold. Or does the cold come with them?
They can only be killed with Obsidian, or Dragonglass. [AFFC](#b ""Sam also reads in an ancient tome at Castle Black that they can be killed by ""dragonsteel"", which is likely Valyrian steel. Not certain about this.. yet."") 


**The wights**, on the other hand, are not alive. They are dead people, animals, [little girls](http://i.imgur.com/aDLbmV6.png) and other weird shit resurrected by the Others, made into zombies. They are strong, feel no pain, require no sustenance and seem to be able to handle themselves in a fight. These creatures are the primary army of the Others, and as they battle with wildlings and the Nights Watch, their army only grows. They can be killed with fire, using lit arrows or simply igniting them with torches (since everything in the show seems to be covered in gasoline). 

**TL;DR: White walkers/Others are the living, weird masters using magic to resurrect people becoming wights.**",149,410,False,self,,,,,

We have 3 who are finished with all the books (myself included), and 2 who have not read the books but are absolutely in love with the story - and while they are careful to avoid spoilers, they are very interested in the lore and the back-stories. 

Because of this, I decided that we should host a celebratory feast in honor of both Robb Stark's wedding, as well as in honor of his uncle (and loyal bannerman) Edmure's upcoming wedding taking place at the Twins very soon, to join House Frey to the Stark cause! I was sure to include sweet flavors for the joy of marriage, as well as something with a bit of bite to it for the pain of Robb and Edmure losing their bachelor status! Not that they were exactly playboys, but hey - as Tyrion said now their watch begins! 

Pictures of the feast can be found here:
http://imgur.com/a/YZm4k

The feast consisted of:

The Appetizers:

* Northman's Salt Beef

* Dornish Suffed Peppers 

* A sampling of Lady Olenna's favorite cheese's with crackers

* Grapes from the Arbor


The Main Course:

* Meat Pie's meat pies

* Slow-cooked rotisserie chicken from the king's own kitchens

* Dornish Roasted diced potatoes with peppers and peas


We all drank hard cider with it, too! I so badly wanted to make lemon cake's for dessert, but they were a little outside my small comfort/skill level and everyone was already soooo stuffed.

Well, I hope you all enjoyed the idea of our feast and I hope it inspires you to try a Game of Thrones feast of your own some time! PLEASE NO SPOILER COMMENTS AT ALL, cheers to everyone and I look forward to the final stretch here towards the end of Season 3 and the Wedding! Let the good times flow, I'm sure it will be a night we'll never forget!",7,0,False,self,,,,,

Joffrey's abuse towards women kind of sounds like it is a reaction to his impotence.  While he seems to young for this to be a problem, I have heard about medical disorders that can cause impotence in teenagers.

If he's unable to perform, and of course he's crazy, it might go a ways to explaining both why he had Sansa stripped, and why he eventually killed Roz.

There are so many characters that believe this, and all of them have to have their reasons why they believe it. I can not even begin to grasp most of them. So, if someone were to interview each one of them and ask why they believe they are the rightful king, what would each of these characters say?

**EDIT:**
In my attempt to make some form of sense out of everything here, I've created the following:

| Character | Justification|
|:----------:|:-------|
|Joffrey|He thinks he is the son of King Robert Baratheon (and pretty much everybody believes this to be true).  If it were true, this would make him King.  However, he is, in fact, son of Cersei and Jaime's incestious relationship, which strips him of his right to the throne.|
|Stannis|Because King Robert Baratheon did not have a legitimate son, the throne falls to Stannis, the king's oldest brother.  He knows Joffrey is not his brother's son, nor are Cercei's other two children (Myrcella and Tommen).  Stannis knows he is rightfully King and is only fighting for the throne because it is his, not because it is something he wants.|
|Renly|King Robert Baratheon's brother, and younger than Stannis.  Like Stannis, Renly also knows that Joffrey was not actually the son of the king.  He has no claim to the throne, but thinks he deserves to be king because he has supporters (including the Tyrells, a very powerful house).  Renly wants to do the same as Robert, who did not become king because he was the heir.  He won it because he won a war.  He thinks he can be the best king, since Joffrey is a monster and Stannis is uncompromising, cold, and under the sway of a foreign religion.|
|Daenerys Targaryen|The only surviving Targaryen, and therefore, the only living child of the Mad King, Dany views herself as Queen because King Robert took power from her father in a coup d'tat.  She is not a part of the War of Five Kings.  Her family created the 7 kingdoms.  She feels that the rebels stole the throne, and the king/kings after him are unlawful/usurpers.|
|Robb Stark|Son of Ned Stark, who was beheaded by King Joffrey.  Robb does not want to sit on the Iron Throne, but wants the North to be independent, as it was before the Targeryens conquered all of Westeros.  He has been declared King in the North by his bannerman, in a tradition dead for thousands of years.  Robb also wants to take revenge on Joffrey for killing his father.|
|Balon Greyjoy|Like Robb in the North, Balon wants the Iron Islands to return to being independent, as it was before the Targeryens conquered Westeros.  The Iron Islands have always been very different from the rest of Westeros and they've never enjoyed being beholden to the Iron Throne.  The Targaryens destroyed them, so they submitted.  When King Robert took over, they rebelled and were defeated again.  Now that the realm has fallen to civil war, they're rebelling again.|


I really hope I got all of the information correct.  Hopefully, it helps someone else out who is having trouble grasping everything, as I did.

There are some great explanations here.  Thank you all for your input.  It will certainly add to my enjoyment and understanding of the show!",74,31,False,self,,,,,

[Game of Thrones to End in Season 7?](http://screenrant.com/game-thrones-season-7-series-finale-ending/) 

From the article:
&gt;A) Fans of the show having to wait extra YEARS between seasons so Martin could finish his next book(s). B) Martin rushing to finish and the story suffering (even more than it has). C) Martin writes and airs the TV show FIRST, and fans of the books have to know the plot line before getting to fully immersive themselves in the world theyve invested in for so long.

What do you think? I think the authors of the show should part ways from the books after the season 5. It would be great if they would invent their own ending independent of the books, not using the knowladge Martin gave them on how he plans to finish it all. 

This way the show could go on without interruption or prolongation and book readers would still enjoy new books even if they saw the series. Although it would mean two seperate endings, I think it's the best solution, because there's no way that Martin will finish whole saga in 4 years.",17,0,False,self,,,,,

Don't read if you don't wanna spoil some elements of the show for yourself. 

Does anyone else feel as though nothing really THAT significant has actually happened? Here we are 8 (fantastic) episodes in and really not much to show for it. The story seems to be progressing but I feel like they built this season up in such a grandiose manner that I feel a tad let down on how many shock &amp;amp; awe moments there have been. The only thing I could compare to that would be when Jaime lost his hand. 

Now I realize the show ISN'T about that sort of thrill. BUT, I've it has predicated itself on being unpredictable. And so far the show has been pretty predictable. Only one notable death, that being Mormont but, even that confused me because it happened all so fast. 

Does anyone else feel the same way? Maybe they're holding out for a grand finale where you're not expecting anything but the same and they pull out some insane twist or event. I don't know. 

edit: Lots of people are telling me that a lot has transpired, I'm not saying a lot hasn't. I'm saying the amount of shock &amp;amp; awe + unpredictable moments this show has predicated itself upon previously has been lacking in the season thus far. Many have already told me that the best is yet to come, and that the final two episodes are sure to hold much promise, not including season 4, which is sure to be utter chaos.

edit2: going to stop reading now since several of you have warned me of how easily this thread could spoil the show for me if certain trolls decide it worthy for such malicious acts. Thanks again to everyone who discussed all this with me! PM me if you wanna continue discussing. It's fun.  ",50,11,False,self,,,,,

Original post went:
Reed: Lying in wait.
Works based on their actions so far in the story, on their methods of combat and guerrilla warfare, AND based on their house sigil (lizard lion/crocodile) Thats 3 levels of meaning.
Also, we should be using this sigil for flair

alt: We watch unseen

Also supported by Walder Frey in A Clash of Kings, when Theon is searching for Brann and Co.
""We won't find them,"" the Frey boy said suddenly. ""Not so long as the frogeaters are with them. Mudmen are sneaks, they won't fight like decent folks, they skulk and use poison arrows. **You never see them, but they see you.** Those who go into the bogs after them get lost and never come out. Their houses *move,* even the castles like Greywater **Watch.**"" He glanced nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides. ""**they might be out there right now, listening to everything we say.**""
-pg. 635.
Bold added for emphasis. 

So then I thought about it more...
Everything about the Reeds support them Watching unseen and lying in wait. 
Hell, Jojen is even a green**seer**, and he often tells Brann about how he witnesses people's deaths in his dreams, but he doesn't do anything about it (well, can't, but still.) just like the reader...

Reader...Reed... HOLY SHIT! The Reeds could be the book stand in for the Reader!

I deleted the previous post to avoid confusion.

---

 I was just reading a thread about the least favorite POV characters and the top comment was Sansa. I agree, I found her chapters so uninteresting that I often finished sessions if her chapter was next and started the next session knowing there wouldn't be two in a row.

HOWEVER, This was not always the rule. The exception was if she had Littlefinger nearby, If he was nearby it offered some insight into his schemes and what is going on with him. He by far is one of the most interesting characters in the series because there are no point of view chapters for him, so his true motives and thoughts are hidden from us and we only see what others see of him. 

Now, I immediately thought the same is true for Lord Varys. You all I expect will admit that when these two characters are involved in ANYONE elses POV chapters, it instantly gets that much better.

But wait, hold up a second now. Throughout five books, GRRM has managed to keep us from having a Varys or Littlefinger chapter. Two of the most interesting players in the series do not have a word written for themselves. Now that got me to thinking, why would that be. I can come up with but one reason and that is GRRM does not want us inside their minds at all. He wants their motives hidden. 

But what motives do they have that we see? 

Littlefinger cares about what? Littlefinger. That much is said about him by none other than Lord Varys. He puts it out there, that Lord Baelish is a selfish man who lives for himself and no one else. His actions do provide evidence for this statement. If he really did have Jon Arryn killed, what was his motive?
 
Lord Varys? ""I serve the realm, someone must."" - Lord Varys. Now as far as I can tell, his actions have been not for personal gain whatsoever. He has gained no lands, money, titles, etc. He doesn't appear to be selfish, despite being filthy rich. Is his purpose truly to bring peace to the realm?

So what we have is chaos and peace, Littlefinger and Lord Varys. Two of the most informed people in the entire world, holders of secrets that can turn the tides of war, gain and lose alliances, have people killed and seated on thrones, lands gained and lost and wars started and ended. 

The reason you haven't had a chapter from these two yet, is because they aren't pieces.

They are the players and Lord Baelish made the first move.

I used the wrong brackets for the title and have contacted the mods and gained approval for resubmission in case anyone says they have seen this before.

---

I was just reading a thread about the least favorite POV characters last night and the top comment was Sansa, However many stated they find her far more interesting now, I differ since I only find her somewhat interesting when she is AROUND interesting people.

I found some of her chapters so uninteresting that I often finished sessions if her chapter was next and started the next session knowing there wouldn't be two in a row.

HOWEVER, This was not always the rule. The exception was if she had Littlefinger nearby, If he was nearby it offered some insight into his schemes and what is going on with him. He by far is one of the most interesting characters in the series because there are no point of view chapters for him, so his true motives and thoughts are hidden from us and we only see what others see of him. 

Now, I immediately thought the same is true for Lord Varys. You all I expect will admit that when these two characters are involved in ANYONE elses POV chapters, it instantly gets that much better.

But wait, hold up a second now. Throughout five books, GRRM has managed to keep us from having a Varys or Littlefinger chapter. Two of the most interesting players in the series do not have a word written for themselves. Now that got me to thinking, why would that be. I can come up with but one reason and that is GRRM does not want us inside their minds at all. He wants their motives hidden. 

But what motives do they have that we see? 

Littlefinger cares about what? Littlefinger. That much is said about him by none other than Lord Varys. He puts it out there, that Lord Baelish is a selfish man who lives for himself and no one else. His actions do provide evidence for this statement. If he really did have Jon Arryn killed, what was his motive?
 
Lord Varys? ""I serve the realm, someone must."" - Lord Varys. Now as far as I can tell, his actions have been not for personal gain whatsoever. He has gained no lands, money, titles, etc. He doesn't appear to be selfish, despite being filthy rich. Is his purpose truly to bring peace to the realm?

So what we have is chaos and peace, Littlefinger and Lord Varys. Two of the most informed people in the entire world, holders of secrets that can turn the tides of war, gain and lose alliances, have people killed and seated on thrones, lands gained and lost and wars started and ended. 

The reason you haven't had a chapter from these two yet, is because they aren't pieces.

They are the players and Lord Baelish made the first move.

And I'm sure this has PROBABLY been discussed somewhere before.  But here it is.  These are just a few reasons that, to me, GoT is infinitely better than LOTR.

I want to start out by first making it known that these books are a little bit hard to compare.  One series is high fantasy (LOTR), and one is low fantasy (GoT).  For those who don't know the difference, high fantasy has demi-gods, elves, dwarves, and the like.  Low fantasy is more human centric.

**Multiple quests**

Lord of the Rings is one quest.  Different things happen along the way, but the essential plot of it is one story.  Find the ring, destroy the ring.  That's it.  Game of Thrones has multiple characters who are each on their own quests for various ends.  The true genius comes in the little details.

**The fine line between good and evil**

In LOTR, there's good guys, and there's bad guys.  Sure, there are a few who straddle the line in between, but for the most part, the roles are set.  Aragorn is good, Sauron is bad.  There's a completely dichotomy of good and evil.  This isn't so in GoT.  All of the characters tend to have a pretty large group of fans, and the black/white good/evil characters are in the minority.  Everyone knows that Eddard is good and Joffrey is bad.  Everyone else sort of lies somewhere in between.

**Wordy-ness**

LOTR was TOO descriptive.  Plain and simple.  Sometimes it felt like you would spend 19 pages reading about the description of the bridge the Hobbits were going to cross six chapters later.  Martin, to me at least, seems to balance some good description with narrative peaks.  There's enough story going on to keep the reader going, while continuing to build character and give excellent imagery as to the context of the scene.

**Money is power**

This is probably the biggest one for me.  There's actual context of a real economy in GoT, something that seems to be missing in LOTR.  What did the battle of Isengard actually COST?  Is Gondor in debt to any of the other kingdoms?  What would happen if the Elves were paid off to switch sides?  This is the sort of stuff that comes up in GoT.  There's real economic context through which the story is driven.  The Lannisters are powerful because they are rich, and they're rich because they control the production of gold.

I'm pretty certain that speech is not in the books and I loved getting a sense of Bronn's military expertise as a juxtaposition of Tyrion's tricks and Varys's espionage tactics. It made the Battle of Blackwater even more terrifying. (My non-book-reading GF asked at the beginning of the next episode, ""Who do you want to win?"" because she was genuinely unsure of who she should root for, or which side to root against the most.)



The other day, I started reading David Benioff's 2008 novel City of Thieves and it's a retelling of his grandfather's struggle to survive inside the city of Leningrad during the notorious siege in WWII. D&amp;D wrote The Prince of Winterfell episode. It's a nice touch to give Bronn the Honor-Free that experience of surviving a siege and knowing that Benioff was channeling his own grandfather.


Nothing fancy to add, just figured you folks might like to know about that Benioff connection. (And since it's a Wednesday between shows, the thread's a little quiet.)",24,127,False,self,,,,,

Another clip of Jon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m724u26zINI

So I've been recapping on previous seasons and I'm reading the first book. Though I have many characters who I enjoy, the two I really love are Jon and his sister Arya.

I remember in season 1 when Jamie was mocking Jon for joining the night's watch, I felt so bad for him the way Jamie taunted and bullied him ... it was like watching a school teacher poking and making funny of a student.

Reasons I really like Jon is that he's gotten such crap treatment from basically everyone, you can see that he loves his siblings as if though they were not half brothers and sisters yet I sense that even Robb treats him like an outsider. Cait I can understand because he's her husbands bastard.

Arya though the scene that I linked, I may be reading too much into the scene but she puts down the sword he gave her to hug him without thinking twice, it seems symbolic to me that she'd give up a weapon to embrace her brother, very touching.

I know it's a long-shot but I hope that there's a happy ending for Jon. When you look at his facial expressions you can't help but feel for the guy and he's really pure of heart :( he's kind of a sad character to me but at the same time inspirational.",17,9,False,self,,,,,

**A Note on Spoilers:** I won't spoil things past the current episode of HBO (Season 3, Episode 7) in terms of plot. Of course, the whole point of this series of posts will be to give some extra information to non-readers about the history of this wonderfully-constructed world, so most of what will be here is taken from the books, even if it contains no spoilers.

If you recall from the last post, things went well for the Children of the Forest before the First Men showed up with bronze weapons and horses. After a long war that saw the destruction of the Arm of Dorne and the flooding of the Neck, the Children and First Men set down and made a treaty.

(I would like to take this opportunity to clarify a statement made in my previous post. The Children mostly stayed in the North and the First Men mostly in the south after this treaty. However, First Men were also allowed in non-forest parts of the North and the Children were allowed in any forest in the South that still had weirwoods. That was limited to the Isle of Faces and the Vale.)

Anyway, the First Men and Children had to face the perilous Others, a demon race known in the show as the white walkers. After nearly being destroyed, they managed to push them back and put up a Wall to keep the Others from attacking again. Thousands of years later, another ethnicity of people called the Andals came from Essos. They landed in the Vale and burned the weirwoods and killed the children south of the neck. Using steel weapons, they soon conquered the lower kingdoms, but could not conquer the North.

That brings us to where we are today, where I will talk about the last race of people to inhabit Westeros, the Rhyonar, and then briefly mention a few different types of people in present-day Westeros.

##THE RHOYNAR

The Rhoynar were a group of people that lived along the Rhoyne River in western/central Essos. The reason they left Essos involves a war with the ancient Valyrian Empire (well get to Valyria and Ghis next week). After Prince Garin led over a quarter of a million Rhoynar to the death to fight the Valyrian expansion, the warrior-queen Nymeria (Aryas wolfs namesake) united the Rhoyne cities and brought them across the Narrow Sea via Dorne (the same way the First Men came). This was around 1,000 years before the start of the series, 700 years before Aegons landing.

The Rhoynar were a slender people with olive skin, black hair, and a smooth complexion. After leading a great Rhoynish exodus from Essos, Nymeria married a Dornish lord, Mors Martell of Sunspear, and helped him to consolidate Dorne under his rule.

To this day, their descendants, the Martells, rule Dorne from Sunspear. Doran Martell is the current lord. The people of Dorne are descendant of the Rhoynar more than that Andals, and most are visibly different from descendants of Andals and First Men due to their olive skin. Anyway, Mors Martell became the first King of Dorne, and the Martells remain the lords of Dorne to this day.

Culturally, the Rhoynish are separate from the Andals and First Men. The ~~Andals~~Rhoynish are egalitarian in inheritance. An older daughter will come before a son in the lineage. Thus, Dorne would have ruling Queens as often as Kings. To this day, Dornish law says that an older daughter comes before a son, and Dornish law rules in Dorne.

In Essos, the Rhoynish worshipped gods of the river. After moving to Essos, most converted to the Faith of the Seven, although some did not. The orphans of Greensblood live on rafts and sail along the Greensblood River and consider themselves orphaned by the Rhoyne. They still worship those gods.

And now onto present day Westeros and the different types of people.

##IRONBORN

Ill start with what might be the most familiar to non-book readers.

The Ironborn are descendants of the First Men. When the First Men assimilated with the Children and took on their gods, the Ironborn did not. They worshipped the Drowned God, whose natural enemy is the Storm God. The King of the Iron Islands sits on the Seastone Chair, which I believe I mentioned last week as the Iron Throne of the Isles. Even after Andals took over the mainland, the majority of the Ironborn stayed true to the Drowned God, with only a few converting to the Faith of the Seven.

The Ironborn were pirates &amp; raiders. Their Old Way came from this lifestyle, which emphasizes strength and praises the skilled raiders. Its why Theon buying jewelry was considered weak of him; he should have paid the iron price (raid/steal) rather than the gold price. During raids, the Ironborn would take captives who worked on farms. Women were taken as salt wives, concubines for the man. A man would only have one rock wife, a true Ironborn wife to give him his trueborn sons.

##WILDLINGS

Another group you're all familiar with. The wildlings, like the Northmen, are descendants of the First Men, but they were north of where the Wall was put up after the War with the Others. The free folk were untouched by the feudal system that developed south of the Wall, and were never conquered by Aegon.

The wildlings are hard to group together, as their customs differ from village to village. They speak either the Old Tongue of the First Men or the Common Tongue that the Andals brought over. The law is isnt anything like it is below the Wall. People protect what they have. The wildlings are a hard people because of thisthe weak dont survive. I could probably do a whole topic on the different wildlings.

Some cultural tidbits: Spearwives are women who choose to fight alongside a specific man. They are considered as tough as the man is. For instance, Ygritte has become Jons spearwife. Marriage isnt so much a ceremony for the wildlings. A man is supposed to steal his woman of another tribe from her home (a daughter, not a wife), and the farther he goes to get his woman means he cares more about his clan.

Because of high infancy mortality rates, it is considered bad luck to name an infant before two years old.

The wildlings often raid beyond the Wall, and it isnt that hard for a small group of wildlings to make it south. Six times there have been Kings Beyond the Wall, all of whom have tried to go south and all of whom fail in different, interesting ways. I might talk about each of their attempts, because there are some great stories.

The wildlings were in direct contact with the Children when they fled from the Seven Kingdoms. The children passed along the ability of greenseeing (Bran and Jojen have it, makes them able to see things in the past, present, future) and warging (putting one's consciousness into the consciousness of animals).

Mance Rayder is the current King-Beyond-the-Wall. He's the son of wildlings, taken in by the Nights Watch. He was raised as a crow but soon defected to the wildlings and amassed a large following, uniting the different wildling tribes and cultures into one army.

##CRANNOGMEN

The people of the Neck are called Crannogmen. The Neck has been sworn to House Stark and considered part of the North since a King in the North killed a marsh king and married his daughter. The Neck was flooded by the Children in their war with the First Men, and is thus a collection of swamps and bogs.

They are ruled by House Reed of Greywater Watch. GW is a mobile castle that moves throughout the marshlands. Howland Reed, the current lord, was a good friend to Ned Stark in Roberts Rebellion, and his children Jojen and Meera are currently with Bran, Rickon, etc.

The crannogmen live off the land, usually by fishing and frogging. They are good hunters, and in war they resort to guerrilla tactics to win. Thus, they are looked down upon by most Westerosi as dishonorable savages. To go through the Neck without being led by the crannogmen, you must go on the Kingsroad. It is high above the marshes, and is a long and slow march for any army.

Moat Cailin, the impregnable castle that protects the North (where the Children stopped the First Men and the First Men stopped the Andals) faces the marshes. Thus, an attack on Moat Cailin involves a knowledge of the land, and thus cooperation with the crannogmen. They have a long feud with House Frey (the ones who Robb was betrothed to marry into and will now be marrying Edmure).

##EASTERN AND NORTHERN MOUNTAIN CLANS

The Mountain Clans of the Vale were first seen in Season 1 when they joined Tyrion and Bronn on the way back from the Eyrie. There are various tribes that are in constant conflict that prey on the weak who travel through the mountains.

The Northern Mountain tribes live in the mountains near the Wall and are considered distinct from the Vales mountain tribes. They have inhabited these mountains for thousands of years. There are forty tribes in the north in total.

Although they are not lords, the chiefs of the tribes are considered as such by their liege lords in Winterfell. Because they call the chief of the Wulls The Wull and the chief of the Harclays The Harclay, etc., they would call Lord Eddard Stark The Ned. They have a lot of respect for the Starks, and some even rode south with Robb in the War of Five Kings.

I would go on, but I'm nearing the end of Reddit's character limit. Next week, I will talk about the Ghiscari Empire, the Valyrian Freehold, and the Free Cities of Essos.

Thus, spoilers aren't really blatant, but there's a few references to the first season. I'd be really interested to get your thoughts on bastardy as it's portrayed within the show and what that says generally about our society. I should also say that I am unfamiliar with the books, so I would enjoy reading some comparisons concerning this topic. And feel free to argue with anything I've written or correct me if I get anything factually inaccurate.

---

So, the HBO drama series, ""Game of Thrones,"" has grown increasingly popular over the last three seasons. The show - a spin-off from a book series, for those who are unfamiliar with it - is a bit like Lord of the Rings, except instead of chasing down the one ring, it's a story of multiple houses vying for power to be King of the land of Westeros, a mythical island not too dissimilar from Britain.

I'll spare you the details of the show as best I can, but at the very least, I've come to notice as I watch that it is obsessed with blood relation and kinship. In fact, in the pilot episode, we meet the ""bastard"" Jon Snow, and a noble-born dwarf named Tyrion Lannaster [says to Jon,](http://youtu.be/-ASZsMRzqhs) **""Let me tell you something, bastard: never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.""**

Since that first episode, I've gotten the impression that Tyrion's words are central to the entire show. That's because everyone in the show who isn't a bastard likes criticizing bastards, and everyone else is a bastard or at least has questionable origins. The show seems to obsess over the question of what makes a person legitimate (or not). The characters who acknowledge their bastardy very often play the role of the underdog (pun intended), and though they don't always come out as winners in the show, you are left with a soft spot for them, especially for Jon Snow, the show's most notable bastard.

I think I want to give just a little more information just to show how obsessed ""Game of Thrones"" is with this topic, or rather, just how obsessed fans are who watch the show. Case in point, in the series online wiki, a fan forum which documents characters, towns, and everything you ever wanted to know about the land of Westeros, there is a [page](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bastardy) dedicated to explaining bastardy. The page explains some of the bastards in the show, and it goes one step further to explain that, in the Westeros mythos, bastards take different names from their biological parents, even if they are acknowledged by their biological family. Thus,

Flowers is the bastard name in the Reach.
Hill is the bastard name for the Westerlands.
Rivers is the bastard name in the Riverlands.
Pyke is the bastard name on the Iron Islands.
Sand is the bastard name of Dorne.
Snow is the surname for bastards north of the Neck, generally referred to as the North.
Stone is the bastard name in the Vale.
Storm is the bastard name in the Stormlands.
Waters is the bastard name of Dragonstone and the Crownlands.

Finally, the wiki page goes on to say that ""bastards are born from lust and lies, grow up more swiftly than other children, and their nature is wanton and treacherous,"" though I'm not sure the show illustrates this point well, even if characters in the show hold a similar stereotype of bastards. *You get the idea.*

I think there's several questions that have been raised for me as I watched the show, but this blog isn't really about ""Game of Thrones."" It's about what ""Game of Thrones"" says about our culture, about our own obsession and interest in blood relation. We seem to talk around issues of adoption, blood relationship, and kinship constantly, without ever really offering any sort of meaningful, critical commentary about what all that means to us, and that concerns me. So, I wanted to ask a couple of questions that relate to the show but are ultimately about our own culture. Here goes:

**1. Does ""Game of Thrones"" perpetuate, inadvertently or not, negative stereotypes or a second-class citizenship of ""bastards""?**

As exemplified by Tyrion's words above, the show seems to offer a positive message about legitimacy ultimately. And yet, I'm not sure the uncritical mind walks away with that message. You know, if you're a 14 year-old watching MacGyver in 1990, you aren't thinking about the fact that dear old Angus, in avoiding gun use, is constantly making a liberal commentary on gun control. You're just thinking it's cool that MacGyver blows stuff up. Thus, I worry that a kid (or even a twenty-something) comes to the show, hears the word ""bastard,"" thinks it's cool that everybody in the show hates on the idea of illegitimacy and then perpetuates those stereotypes in later conversations with friends.

I suppose you could argue that the show is offering a commentary on a kind of mythical medieval period, so we shouldn't dwell on what it says about us, but as consumers and the audience at hand, the show is very much about our own society, a society where we - sadly - still look down on those born out-of-wedlock. The difference is that, in the show, it's blatant: everybody knows who is and isn't a bastard. It's connected to your name, so as soon as you say, ""I'm so-and-so of the house of Stone,"" your bastardy is unveiled. I think that's an intentional effort to allow the show to make its commentary on kinship, because for our own culture, bastardy is an invisible shame, a slur people use often without knowing who they're insulting. And, to be fair, insulting someone's legitimacy isn't as common as racism or homophobia. So, too, it's far more subtle and tends to play out more in the way we value or understand the construction of the family or in the way we look down on people who come from ""broken homes."" 

**2. What are we to do with the term bastard?**

Along that line of thought is the issue of the word ""bastard"" itself. It's a hateful slur, and in recent years, it's a slur that's not always been connected to someone's legitimacy. To the contrary, it's a term that's been used most often to demonstrate when a person is being a jerk. But to someone who has questionable origins, the original connotations of the term don't go unnoticed. We no longer say to the queer community, ""Oh, I meant 'faggot,' as if to say he was just being uncool."" Instead, we recognize that term to be off-limits.

Personally, I have mixed feelings about the term ""bastard."" Some groups, like [""Bastard Nation""](http://bastards.org/faqs) have picked up the terminology and embraced it the same way ""queer"" has been embraced and given a positive connotation. This practice of reclaiming language fits squarely in line with Tyrion's advice to ""wear it like armor."" It's a smart way to empower the powerless.

And yet, I still don't know whether ""bastard"" is more like ""faggot"" or whether it's more like ""queer.""

But I do know that the concept of illegitimacy should have already died out when medieval periods like the one portrayed in Westeros advanced into the modern era. Today, we know that kinship is a social construct. There is no such thing as an ""illegitimate"" child. That is, there are no longer laws on the books that make a child unlawful, to get to the heart of the definition and etymology of ""legitimacy.""  While there may still be illegal acts, like rape, that can bring children into the world, the children themselves no longer have to carry the shame and stigma of their parents actions; although, if they do, it's because out society thrust that shame upon them, not because they thrust it on themselves.

That is, if indeed bastards ""grow up more swiftly than other children, and their nature is wanton and treacherous,"" it is because of the way society hammered it over their heads that they were somehow different from, say, children of blood relation. And that is very much a societal construct, one we should have already tossed to the side.

Perhaps that is what makes a show like ""Game of Thrones"" so compelling. In all its blood, sweat, tears, and sex, it forces the audience to ask what makes us human. And the answer seems to be that our family, regardless of whether we are noble, blood-born, or baseborn (i.e. a bastard) isn't what makes us human or good or special. Sure, our beginnings can give us advantages and disadvantages, as far as we allow the world to define those, but who we really are is defined by our everyday decisions, and far too few of us figure that out because of the lie we are repeatedly told that we are our parents' children and nothing more.

That is the difference between carrying your past around like a weight on your shoulders and wearing it like armor.

Edit: changed ""England"" to ""Great Britain"" at the behest of an angry redditor; other grammatical changes.

i guess it's just hard for me to understand why they are enemies. in my eyes, the wildings were never a reason for the Wall, it was just circumstantial that they were north of it when it was built. the wildings and south-wall people just live different life styles, i don't see the reasoning behind their hate for each other. 

also, i dont read the books so i'm not sure if this was covered there at all. ",15,18,False,self,,,,,

I just want to make sure I know some of the important information that the show may have glossed over. 

* What do we (or should we) know of House Tarly at this moment? Sam states that his father was as cruel as Craster but in a different manner. What did his father do to him? Why did Sam go to The Wall in the first place?

* Is there anything we should know about the dragon-glass/obsidian dagger that hasn't been mentioned at this point? Is it an instakill on White Walkers like the show portrayed or is it just one of the few materials that can hurt them?

The camera then cuts to a shot from behind the King's guard as the sheath their swords, but if you pay attention to the guard to the far right in the shot, he struggles with his sword and can't sheath it for several seconds, never succeeding until the shot cuts.

After you declare your house/organization, you shouldn't be able to leave it, so if your group is losing, it would force you to decide amongst yourselves what move to make next.

Is there anyway to create a game on this subreddit or a new one?

The first is either that the known world does not exist in a universe remotely like ours and that the known world is not on spherical planet revolving around a star like ours does where the north and south are equally cold and middle is the hottest. This would also mean that sun, moon and stars are not like they are in our universe and could be a whole range of magical or mundane  things. The other explanation would be that known world takes place on massive planet and that only a very small is part of known world. This would mean that equator region of this world is uninhabitable and that south of the equator there is a completely different world separate from the known world of ASOIF. So my question is do you think there are explanations for the way the ASOIF world is? if so what are they, if not which of my explenation do you think is most likely?",14,10,False,self,,,,,

Sophie Turner is a lot older than book Sansa, so it's a lot harder to brush away this kind of stupidity as naivete.

Could it be an issue with translating Sansa's internal dialogue from the books ? I always felt they were very distinct from other characters, lacking complexity and conflict and very little of the scheming and rumination that is commonplace in characters like Tyrion or Arya.

Well the books tell us that this happened when Tywin was 17, some 40  years before the Clash of Kings. So when Cersei outright threatens Maergery with this tale, and explains how she could smell the bodies, what do you believe? While the show writers of course reserve the right to alter the story, I prefer to think this was just Cersei's attempt to act strong. That the story still happened well before Cersei was born, but she has embellished the story to add herself into the lore. A small plot to try and give herself an edge over the new soon-to-be-queen.

I know Game of Thrones/ASOIAF as their own tab on the site, I'd just like to hear some from you.

Two came to me a few nights ago. I was rereading the Battle of Blackwater, Davos' chapter to be specific, and I remember reading through all the names of the ships. And all the names of the captains. And several crew. We all know the series has a truckload of characters, and it's pretty obvious that they're all named to avert the idea of the faceless soldier.

But we all know we just don't remember some of those guys. We hear a name and 9 times out of ten, it will go in one eye and out the other. I can't tell you how many Flossoways of both Green and Red I've read and immediately forgotten. But then it hit me. The fridge brilliance of it. 

We don't care about them because we are JUST like the highborn lords of ASOIAF! We all know a huge theme in the books is that ultimately, The Game of Thrones is just that. A game for the rich, and it is repeated several times that the poor just don't give a damn, and the rich consider the lower borns just that. 

In real life, we might consider that ludicrious and cruel, but when you're reading the books, you're not processing the minor characters. You are just like the lords you're reading about. 

Then that in turn lead to another one. With all the debating and theories we have about the characters: R+L=J, Tyrion is potentially the Bastard of Aerys, who the ""younger brother"" is, how some Bastards' blood is useful, who is the right heir and what does it mean to truely be an heir...

Just like the Lords and Lady of Westeros, we argue, are confused and most importantly, CARE just as much about bloodlines as they do.

Both the misspellings that I encountered were in the Daenerys chapters and both of them were also names of characters (wont name names to avoid spoilers). 

As I understand, GRRM rights the manuscript, and sends it off to editors to find plot holes, misspellings(!!), and sometimes even add plot elements. These books are of very high production value, and it makes me wonder how something as rudimentary as the spelling of a name/word could be overlooked in a series as popular as this one.  

I'm not nitpicking, just wondering.

Personally, I'm thinking with the funky pacing going on, there are three options:

* Red Wedding happens e09, with Joffery's wedding following on e10 (Unlikely and sloppy, no time to show some of the aftermath with Tyrion and others)

* They do the Red Wedding, but do something weird with Joffery for now until next season where they can devote more time to the plot lines involved (as in, something outside of cannon.)


And the one I lean to:

* The Red Wedding and Joffery's wedding will be in e09, with e10 playing clean up crew. ",16,0,False,self,,,,,

However, did Stannis *seek* Melisandre or did Melisandre seek Stannis? Also, does Stannis know she's playing him the fool?She lied to him about Lightbringer and made him believe he was the reincarnation of Azor Ahai. I know this season she confronted Thoros about failing in converting King Robert to the way of R'hllor (I'm guessing so the masses would follow the Lord of Light via theocratic governing), so I'm guessing she's trying to stick her stake in Stannis in case he takes the Iron Throne so it'll be easier in doing what Thoros failed to do?

The show changed the sigil to be just the head of a direwolf to provide a more obvious difference to the full-body Lannister lion and because most of the active use of the sigil in the field is seen with Robb Stark, who uses just the head for his personal sigil.  So the show's head sigil has been moved to the Robb Stark option, with House Stark getting the old complete direwolf from the books and seen on the show early in season 1.
* House Tully's field has been changed to match the books.  The show's version was not as historically accurate either, and since a version of that sigil was being created for The Blackfish, it seemed time to fix the regular Tully sigil at the same time.
* The Brave Companions' sigil has been moved to the new Vargo Hoat entry.  The black goat sigil is the correct one used by the Bloody Mummers in difference to their leader Hoat, and the old sigil the subreddit used was a custom one simply inspired by the ""Footmen"" nickname the group is also called. 

**These flair changes are not live as of this post.  They will be rolled out mostly tonight, with possible tweaks continuing tomorrow.**

-----

EDIT: The new words for all existing flair options have been added.  That provides alternate text for all of the 28 most popular Houses and 21 most popular groups.  More updates are in progress!
---

-----

EDIT2: All of the new Personal Sigils and Group sigils are now available.  As part of creating the new Personal options, House Baratheon of Dragonstone and Kings Landing have been renamed for Stannis and Joffrey, respectively.  Only the other new House options remain for the update.

The [Book Spoiler](#b ""Massacre at the wedding at the twins"") and the [Book Spoiler](#b ""death of Joffrey"") haven't been shown yet, although they occur way earlier in the book.
I didn't have the impression, that they were so much behind in Season 1 and 2.

Sure, those are absolute plot-highlights and I understand they want a great finale, but I wonder how they will fit all the remaining storyline in just two episodes...

After all there are still to show [Book Spoiler](#b ""the battle at the wall, John Snow's election and Sansa's escape. Also Little Finger pushing Lisa through the door will make a great last scene for Ep3.10""), but I wonder how they will show all those great events in so little time.

Tinfoil time!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1f5tuo/no_spoilers_the_white_walkers_built_the_wall/,Naggers123,1369692273,"Standing 700ft tall, The Wall is the most awe-inspiring and mystifying landmark in the whole of Westeros.

Legends say it was constructed 8000 years ago by one Brandon the Builder, forebears to the Stark family. He supposedly used magic to raise a wall 300 miles long made with nothing but ice.

No one knows how he accomplished it, save for some age old stories that sound more like fairy-tale fiction and whimsy conjecture than factual historical accounts.

The reason for this is simple - Bran didn't build it.

**History is written by the victors.** Man won the War for the Dawn, and what's more - they started it. They grabbed their dragonglass spears, wielded their swords of fire, and breached a wall that was already there - the last line of defence put up by none other than the White Walkers themselves. But Azor Ahai struck North, and drove out the natives like the Americans driving out the Red Indians.

Who else would be more suitable to construct a 700ft wall of ice than creatures that are themselves made from ice, and are known to be capable of wielding magical power far beyond the comprehension of man.

The Wall existed far before the First Men came to the shores of Westeros, but what better way to extol the power and supremacy of humankind by claiming such a breathtaking monument as their own. Like Lann the Trickster, one simple act of deception has been able to establish a dynasty that has lasted for generations. The Starks are always friends to The Watch.

The First Men have invaded the native's lands, settling cities like Hardhome, establishing clans like the Thenns and brazenly sending their ilk as far north as their bodies will let them. The greed of man has driven them away from their homes and into the Lands of Always Winter.

*And now the White Walkers want it back.*

No, new episode this week, but I don't take breaks, this is ""adding context"" for this week, consider it a bonus episode.... This post is 100% safe for non readers as it all deals with backstory/lore...though I will go ahead and keep the spoiler scope to the most current episode for the comment section... In this post I will go though The Targaryen Kings, from Aegon the Conqueror, to Aerys II and give a brief description of when and how they ruled, and what they are known for... I imagine /u/jdylopa will cover some of this in his Westerosi history series eventually as well, so I wont step on his toes too much, and try to keep it brief... well, let's begin...

(Thanks to the Wiki of Ice and Fire for the finer details, namely the dates. 

- Aegon I Targaryen, aka Aegon ""The Conqueror""
1AL- 37AL 

Now, if you've seen the bonus features on the season 1 and 2 BD sets, we know quite a bit of Aegon's conquest of Westeros, and almost all the information we have on Aegon comes from his war.. and I wont go too much into that as show viewers have been given decent insight into it.  But what did Aegon do after and before his war.. He had already been involved with conflicts in the Free Cities, namely siding with Tyrosh against Volantis in their failed attempt to restore the Valaryian Freehold.  But what about after the War, he ruled for 30+years after he united the realm, what did he do?  Sadly little canonical information on his reign has been given. We do know he established the Kingsguard and the Office of Hand of the King, gave his bastard brother Orys Storms End and through him established the House Baratheon, failing to conqueror Dorne, and lastly sired a couple of children.. leading us to....

- Aenys Targaryen. 
37AL-42L

There is relatively little that our second Targaryen monarch was involved with in his short reign, considered weak, the Faith of the Seven at the time was a powerful force in Westeros.. Moreso there existed a branch of the Faith called the ""Faith Militant"" which was exactly as it sounds, Soldiers for the Faith of the Seven, and it was during the reign of Aenys that they rose up and challenged his rule, using the incest of his parents (he was the child of Aegon's sister-wife Rhaenys) as pretense..a minor conflict that continued on after his death..

-  Maegor I Targaryen, aka Maegor ""The Cruel""
42AL-48AL

This notoriously brutal Targaryen king was known for not only continuing the conflict against the Faith that his half-brother (he was born to Aegon's other sister-wife Visenya) Aenys had left behind, in a fierce and violent manner (sometimes offering coin for the scalps of certain Faith Militant personnel), but for the massacre and murder of the architects and builder of the Red Keep when it was finished during his reign to keep it's secrets, both deeds earning him his nickname, ""The Cruel"".  It is also worth note, that he stepped in line for the throne, taking the rule for himself infront of his nephew...

- Jaehaerys I Targaryen, aka Jaehaerys ""The Conciliator""/ ""The Old King""
48AL-103AL

Jaehaery's rule as I noted above did not come after his father Aenys, but was superseded by his uncle Maegor, for reasons not explained, but as Maegor left no children, Jaehaerys came to his throne when his uncle died.  Jaehaerys is probably known as the best King Westeros has ever had, under his rule he ended the Faith Militant uprising, peacefully, established Maegor's Law (which ended the military branch of the faith, as long as The Crown agreed to always ""Defend the Faith""), and kept the longest running era of peace during his near 60 year reign.  His Queen, Alysanne is equally loved and remembered. 

-  Viserys I Targaryen
 
The deeds of this Targaryen monarch (grandson of Jaehaerys) are not known, but what legacy he does have is marred by his offspring.. His reign continued the peace left by his predecessor, but to his dismay his first marriage left him with no male heir to inherit the throne, so Viserys starting grooming and raising his daughter Rhaenyra to take over when he died... However Viserys did beget a son through his second marriage, another Aegon, but even upon his death bed still wished his daughter to inherit the throne... the destruction and horror his death left is remembered still. 

- Aegon II Targaryen
129Al-131AL

When King Viserys I died, a ""who to crown"" was left open.  Follow the kings wishes and crown Rhaenyra?  Or crown his eldest son Aegon... This decision found the lap of the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole, who crowned Aegon above his sister.. Rhaenyra of course contested this decision, leading to the first major conflict of the Targaryen dynasty, the ""Dance of the Dragons"".  The turning point in said war came when Aegon murdered his sister by feeding her to his Dragon, however it did not end the war as Rhaenyra's supporters continued her cause in the name of her eldest son, also and Aegon.  Aegon II did not long outlive his sister, and without a son of his own Rhaenyra was given reprieve when her eldest son took the throne..

- Aegon III Targaryen, aka ""The Dragonsbane"" 
131AL- 157AL

The first king after the ""Dance of the Dragons"" Aegon ruled long and good, but his legacy is marked by the death of the last Targaryen dragon during his rule, giving him his nickname, ""The Dragonsbane"", Aegon was known for his dislike of the creatures after seeing his mother devoured by one, and is blamed for their extinction. 

- Daeron I Targaryen, aka The Young Dragon/The Boy King
157AL-161AL

This king was only 14 when he ascended the throne after the death of Aegon III, his father, and is most well known for picking up where his ancestor Aegon the conqueror failed, in adding Dorne to the realm. And to his credit, he succeeded, Dorne bent the knee and joined the realm.... for two weeks.  Dorne could not be held, and in trying to do so led to his young death, leaving no child he was followed by his brother..

- Baelor I Targaryen, aka Baelor ""The Blessed"" 
161AL-171AL

This Targaryen King, is well remembered in Westeros because of his strong faith and piety.  During his reign he was known for the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor, which relocated the hub of the Faith of the Seven from Oldtown to Kings Landing, locking away his sisters so he would not be tempted sexually by them, banishing the whores in Kings Landing, saving his cousin, the legendary Aemon ""The Dragonknight"" from a pit of vipers, and other such what some call ""estimable"" acts, and others view as an embarrassment, Tyrion notes that Baelor's nickname should have rather been ""The Befuddled"" as opposed to ""The Blessed"" when reflecting on this King...

- Viserys II Targaryen. 
171AL-172AL

This king was the second son to Rhaenyra Targaryen, and as uncle to both kings Daeron I and Baelor I, Viserys acted as hand of the king during their rule..and came to the throne as neither of them had children.. It is widely believed that he poisoned his nephew Baelor to gain the throne, and is not kindly remembered in Westeros, having a short reign of only 1 year part of that sour reputation.  However, Tyrion also remembers Viserys II with somewhat of a reverence, as Hand of the King for both his nephews he was essentially the ruler of the realm ""while Daeron warred, and Baelor preyed"" .

- Aegon IV Targaryen. aka Aegon ""The Unworthy""
172AL-184AL

The Rule of Aegon IV started off well when he took the throne after the death of his father Viserys, but in the years to come his legacy would be tarnished by a huge gain of weight, a reputation of being very lecherous, and the siring of numerous bastards, which would eventually lead to one of the biggest conflicst Westeros has ever seen (remind anyone of someone else?), the Blackfyre rebellions.  His dishonorable nickname of ""The Unworthy"" comes from him, on his death-bed legitimizing his bastards, thus placing them in the line of secession for the throne, as well as bestowing the ancient Targaryan Valyrian steel sword ""Blackfyre"" onto his eldest Bastard ""Daemon""... 

- Daeron II Targaryen, aka Daeron ""The Good""
184AL-209AL

The start of this King's reign was marred by War, when his half-brother, Daemon,  now legitimized took up arms against him and named himself King, while taking the surname ""Blackfyre"", after the ancient Targaryen family sword.  Daemon used the popular (and likely true) belief that Daeron was not the trueborn son of Aegon IV, but the bastard of Aegon's brother, Aemon ""The Dragonknight"" and Queen Naerys, who was also both their sister.. (sound familiar as well?).  He gained a lot of support and the first of the Blackfyre rebellions were fought.  With the help of his half brother Bryden Rivers, aka Bloodraven, and another bastard of Aegon IV, Daeron prevailed against Daemon Blackfyre.  The years of his rule after the rebellion were peacefull, and after nearly 200 years accomplished what neither Aegon ""The Conqueror"", nor Daeron I could do, brought Dorne into the realm, for good, by taking a Martell as his queen...who were able to have four sons before his death at a plague that took Westeros known as the Great Spring Sickness

- Aerys I Targaryen
209AL-221AL

As the second son of Daeron II,  Aerys' reign was unremarkable. He was very bookish, and had a childless marriage.  He appointed his uncle Bryden Rivers (Bloodraven) as hand of the King during his reign and let him rule while he secluded himself in books.. as he was childless the throne went to his youngest brother...

- Maekar I Targaryen
221AL-233AL

The brother to late King Aerys, and the 4th son of King Daeron II, Maekar's rule was unlikely.  His other two elder brothers, Baelor Breakspear [Dunk and Egg](#s ""Dead at Maekar's own hand by a mishap at the tourney at Ashford""), and with Rhaegel unfit for rule (was literally insane, known for running through the Red Keep naked and singing at the top of his luns), he came to his throne.  During his reign he imprisoned the hand of the king, Bloodraven.  He died to a rebel lord in 233AL (no canon information has been given on that) 

- Aegon V Targaryen aka Aegon ""The Unlikely""  
233AL-259AL

As the 4th Son of a 4th son, Aegon, one of the most revered Targaryen Kings and the titular ""Egg"" in the Dunk and Egg series of novellas was not likely to ascend to the throne, which is why his nickname is ""The Unlikely"" His two eldest brothers were Daeron (who would have been Daeron III), who ""died of a pox contracted from a whore"", and Aerion who while banished from the realm, drank a cup of wildfire thinking he would be reborn a dragon.  The crown was offered to his next eldest brother Aemon, (The Maester Aemon we all know and love), who as a Maester of the Citadel, refused the throne and gave it to Aegon.  Aegon, aka Egg's early years, prior to him taking the throne, are chronicled in the 3 published ""Dunk and Egg"" novellas, which are still ongoing.  Aegon's rule was well regarded though it ended in tragedy.  He was known for letting his children marry for love rather than arranged marriages, which some say lead to the dismay of the realm, it was during his reign that the last of the Blackfyre rebellions was fought, during the war of the Ninepenny kings.  One of the most curious things about his reign was him hearing of a prophecy that the long fabeled ""Prince that Was Promised"" would be born to the line of his grandchildren, Aerys (Who would later be the mad King), and Rhaella, and arranged their marriage because of it.  He died tragically in an event known as the Tragedy of Summerhall, along with his lord commander of the Kingsuard, Duncan The Tall (Dunk of ""Dunk and Egg"") and his heir, Duncan the Small, in an attempt to hatch dragon eggs... This was also the day prince Rhaegar Targaryen was born..

- Jaehaerys II Targaryen 
259AL-262AL

This completely unremarkable King's reign was short, but good.. Not really known for anything other than being the 2nd son to Egg, and the father of the Mad King.  For the show audience, Jaehaerys is completely cut out of show canon. When Aemon is talking to Jon Snow in season 1 he names Aegon V, aka Egg as his brother (which is correct), but lists the Mad King Aerys as his nephew, not great nephew.. Thus in the show Jaehaerys II, is non existent.  The Mad King is Egg's son in the show.

- Aerys II Targaryen aka ""The Mad King"" 
262AL-283AL

Here we are at last, at the end, the final Targaryen King.. As show viewers already know quite a deal about this character from the history of Robert's Rebellion and how he dealt with people he didn't care for (Like Rickard and Brandon Stark), I wont elaborate too much.  But in his early years he was regarded as a good king, who ruled well.  He named a powerful young Tywin Lannister as his hand, and for the better part of his reign he was a just and fair king... Until the Defiance of Duskendale, when a rebel lord took him captive for six months and threatened to kill him if anyone attempted a rescue..  He was rescued eventually by Ser Barristain Selmy, but left his sanity in the castle in which he was held.. you know the rest.. His insanity led to bad decisions, rejection loyal hands of the kings, and a rebellion that cost him his life and put an end to the Targaryen Dynasty...  and we are at an end 

Before I go, I would like to mention Aery's heirs, first his son Rhaegar, who would have been king after him.. After Rhaegar died, his son Aegon, (who would have been King Aegon VI should he had lived) would be his next heir.. That too did not come to pass, Ser Gregor Clegane saw to that..  At the Start of GoT, and the First season we see Viserys, the Mad King's youngest son style himelf as Viserys III, correctly so as he would have been the third Viserys to sit the throne, but that too did not come to pass, Khal Drogo saw to that... And now all we have left is Danerys, who if she comes to the throne would be the first ruling Queen in Westeros, and the first of her name... 

... and with that, thanks for reading, hope I helped you, the non-reader gain some insight... Ill be back next week with something that hopefully ties into something we see in an actual episode.. until then, have a great week, and happy Memorial Day.  


**EDIT TO ADD:**  

If you are coming to this post after Feb 24th 2014, I am vastly expanding upon this and going through the entire history of the Targaryen Dynasty a few monarchs at a time.  While this is intended as a ""quick reference guide"" these new post are much more in depth.. you can go there and read part 1 of the series [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ypfqb/no_spoilers_the_history_of_the_targaryen_dynasty/)

That being said, I have a question concerning spoiler tag policy.

If the title of a post is, say, ""[S4E10] An analysis of the character Cersei Lannister,"" it *is* implied that any and all comments are acceptable within that post *as long as they concern events happening at or before Season 4 Episode 10 and that point in ASOS*, right? In other words, if I wanted to mention the death of a character in season 1, I wouldn't be required to put spoiler tags, would I? Only if the event occurs past S4E10 and that event in ASOS?

I've always assumed that was the case, but in my time here on /r/gameofthrones, I've seen people place spoiler tags for events that occur *before* what was originally being discussed.

I just want to make sure that I'm contributing to this community and not ruining the ASOIAF experience for anybody.

Thanks guys!",5,7,False,self,,,,,

Why do we allow beauty and charm to scew our moral compass so much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1f6xac/s3e8_are_daenerys_and_tyrion_the_most_evil/,PropogandaOfTheDeed,1369736977,"Please tag any spoilers that haven't taken place in the TV shows yet.


I find it strange that so many look at Tyrion and Daenerys as the ""good guys"" in GOT even though they have carried out some of the most evil actions. 


Let's take a look at Daenerys first. On her orders every slave holder in Astapor was slain without trial or regard for their individual character. She left an entire city of orphans in her wake yet our reaction wasn't to condemn her or question her.... Our reaction was to cheer her on. 


There is no doubt that slavery is evil but is murdering every man and woman because of the culture they were raised in really justice? How was she so sure that there wasn't an abolishionist movement or slave holders that bought slaves solely for the purpose of keeping them from other cruel slave holders? We've already learned that we can't judge someone's character because of the family they were raised in, why are we so willing to judge it based off of the city they were raised in? At the heart of Daenerys' character is someone who wants power above all else just like any other character. The evils she commits are no different from Joffery's except for the fact that they are on a larger scale. 


I can't help but wonder what our reaction would be to her actions had they come from a package that was less beautiful than Daenerys is. 


Now let's take a look at Tyrion. When we think of Tyrion we think of a highly intelligent character that always seems to show up just in time to save the day, stopping Joffrey from beating a defenseless girl and delivering a witty and charming line or two. Yet this intelligence is exactly what makes him so damn evil. He knows how truly evil Joffrey is. He's more aware of it than any other character and he's the only character that really had the opportunity to put a stop to it. 


He's witnessed Joffrey do everything from murdering babies to the senseless torturing of singers yet when the time came to put an end to this tyrant instead of stepping up, he burned thousands of soldiers alive in the battle of Black Water... And we cheered him on for it. Tyrion is the only reason Joffrey is still in power. And Shay even begged him to leave. He had the chance and the means to leave and allow an end to come to the untold misery of the people of King's Landing.  Yet Tyrion stayed to keep Joffrey in power because, as he put he, ""he likes the game"". If you ask me, Tyrion is responsible for every tyrannical act committed by Joffrey after that battle just as much as Joffrey is. 


Yet because Tyrion is so charming we look at him as a hero. 


I don't think we really look at people's actions or character when we determine if they are good or bad. We look at their charm and beauty. Is it any wonder the world is in the state it is when you consider this? ",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Okay in the scene linked above it clearly has Varys in two places at once. I can't find a video with the full scene so here's the sequence of events:

First it shows Arya chasing a cat under the castle. Then it cuts to Varys talking to Ned Stark about the his and the king's life being in danger. Then it cuts back to Arya where she is hiding and Varys is walking with Viserys' friend talking about the need to kill Ned Stark. 

Can someone help me make sense of this. In the book (I've only read the first) it doesn't identify Varys but in the show you can clearly see its him. Arya says she thinks he's an unnamed magician. How is Varys in two places at once? Is he a magician of some sort? I thought he hated magic. With as good of filmmakers the producers are there's no way this is just an oversight.

Currently the [Lannister jerseys are available until the end of May.](http://www.geekyjerseys.com/product.php?id=137) They'll ship in mid-July, ideal hockey weather!

Offers change every month, so in June I hope to offer another GoT design (probably Targaryen), it all depends on how busy Geeky Jerseys is. Night's Watch and Greyjoy are in the queue as well. Please stay tuned to my [Website](http://davesgeekyhockey.com/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/davesgeekyideas)/[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DavesGeekyWorld) for announcements, more giveaways, and other neat stuff.

We would love the discerning redditors of r/GameofThrones to come along and participate.

If you play Skyrim please enter, and if not you can vote or just browse and have a laugh!

Skyrim is an RPG game set in a medieval type, snowy Nordic landscape so GOT characters fit right in.

And as we specialise in all that is beardy in Skyrim, we thought it an appropriate theme for our first competition.

so it is established that a bastard gets the last name of the area where he was born/is from (ie. Jon ""Snow,"" north, etc.)  if a bastard child  were grow up and marry a woman and have children, what would his family name me?  it doesn't seem like it would be the bastard surname... that would make things confusing down the road with lots of Snows, Flowers, Rivers, etc. that have married parents.

I feel like on the show, high- and low-borns have family names, they just aren't a ""House.""  Right?

Then it shows him seeming to be captured by the Lannister guards and dragged into the castle. However, the next scene he is in, he is back at his castle with Maelysandre.

There's also a further (unconfirmed) rumor that Ellaria Sand is being cast as well, which certainly makes sense.

Some of these are more important characters than others.  One of them is likely THE most anticipated addition to the cast in the series thus far - it is absolutely essential that the Red Viper be done justice.

We don't know who will be chosen for these roles as of yet, but we can still speculate.  

**Who do you think would be best for the roles listed above?**

I highly doubt that Tywin will sleep with Shae and that's what will drive Tyrion to kill him. Rather, I think Tywin will either kill Shae or do something horrible to her, such as give her to a bunch of men to be raped. 

Why do I think this? The Tywin in the show doesn't seem like he'd do such a thing as sleep with a prostitute AT ALL. Also, it doesn't seem like something Shae would do. In the books, she's a bit more ditzy and less sympathetic. In the show she's way smarter and almost a different person. I don't see her sleeping with Tywin.

Of course, the whole point of this series of posts will be to give some extra information to non-readers about the history of this wonderfully-constructed world, so most of what will be here is taken from the books, even if it contains no spoilers.

##Ghiscari Empire

The Ghiscari Empire was the oldest recorded civilization in Essos, and perhaps one of the oldest in the world. It is unclear exactly how long ago it rose, but it fell over 5,000 years ago.

The Ghiscari Empire reigned supreme over much of Essos, and had the Harpy as its emblem. The capital was Old Ghis, a city which now does not exist. On the map, it is south of Meereen, Yunkai, and Astapor, near the south of Essos. The architecture of Ghis and its closest colony cities were based around pyramids built by slaves. The Ghiscari army was highly disciplined, and feared around the region. They could be considered the precursors to the Unsullied.

Not a lot is recorded about the Ghiscari Empire except its fall. But before we get to its fall, we must look at the rising empire known as the Valyrian Freehold.

##Valyrian Freehold

Across from Ghis sits the Valyrian Peninsula. The Valyrians were once a humble people, mostly sheep herders. They were a peaceful folk until the dragons along the Fourteen Fires, a group of islands to the south of the mainland, were discovered. The Valyrians tamed the dragons with magic, and trained them to become devastating weapons of war.

The Valyrians expanded their influence, establishing the Freehold with Valyria as its capital. With dragons came a great magic. Skyscrapers were constructed, stone sphinxes built. Smiths forged swords of legendary strength and sharpness, later known as Valyrian Steel. But the heart of their power was their dragons.

##War Between the Ghiscari Empire and the Valyrian Freehold

Around 5,000 years before the series, the Ghiscari Empire saw the rising Valyria and decided to take their dragons. They knew that the dragons were the base of Valyrian power. With dragons, the Ghiscari could subjugate Valyria, expand their influence further, and be undefeatable. Five great wars were fought between Ghiscar and the Freehold, but Valyrias dragons defeated the Ghiscari armies each time.

In the last of the great wars, the Valyrians smashes the Ghiscari legions and used their dragons to burn Ghis and its great pyramids to the ground. After Ghis was burned, the Valyrians sowed the fields with salt and sulfur to prevent any survivors from returning. It was a lot like the Roman/Carthage wars in real history.

##Aftermath

With the destruction of Ghis, the Ghiscari Empire collapsed. The survivors fled to an island to the south of Ghis, and raised New Ghis. The Slavers Bay colonies  Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen  rose to prominence as the global center for the slave trade, and the Masters of the cities became extremely wealthy. 

Meanwhlie, Valyrias power grew and grew. They themselves kept more than just a toe in the slave market. The Valyrians began to look to the civilizations along the Rhoyne River. As they began to encroach, Prince Garin of the Rhoynar led an army of 250,000 soldiers against Valyria. As I mentioned last week, they wree easily defeated by the dragons, and the remnants fled to Dorne under Nymeria.

Valyria continued to expand and conquer further west. They captured slaves and used them to mine the Fourteen Flames for more wealth and to build great cities and roadways that led to Valyria. The Freeholds cities included Valyria, Oros, Mantarys, Tyria, and the Free Cities (except for Braavos): Pentos, Lys, Qohor, Norvos, Myr, Tyrosh, Volantis, and Lorath.

At its height, the Freehold controlled most of the continent. All of the present-day Free Cities were colonies of Valyria, with the sole exception of Braaovs (which itself was a hidden city formed by former Valyrian slaves). They did not focus so much on eastward expansion, as the Red Waste laid between Valyria and the other more enticing places (Qarth, Yi Ti, Asshai, etc.).

The westernmost outpost of the empire was Dragonstone, in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros (known in Essos as ""the Sunset Kingdoms,"" as they are in the west, where the sun sets).

##Valyrian Language

One important thing to note about Valyrian culture is the language. If the Ghiscari Empire was akin to Carthage, then Valyria is the equivalent to Rome. High Valyrian is the main language of the Valyrian Freehold. After the eventual fall of Valyria, the language persisted, just as Latin gave way to the Romance Languages.

In present-day Essos, in addition to the High Valyrian usually spoken in formal settings, there are countless dialects. Bastard Valyrian is spoken in each of the Nine Free Cities, though each city has its own dialect with their own vocabulary, and they can be counted as nine separate languages. The Slaver's Bay remnants of the Ghiscari Empire speak in a tongue with a Valyrian-base, though their language is heavily influenced by the gutteral Ghiscari language. Still, each city (Astapor, Yunkai, Meereen, New Ghis) all have their own dialects.

Like Latin, High Valyrian is a language with much prestige. Daenerys learns it from a young age, growing up in the Free Cities. Most high-born Westerosi learn a bit of High Valyrian. It is mentioned that Arya has learned a bit of High Valyrian from Maester Luwin, though it isn't all that great. Tyrion knows a fair bit of Valyrian, as does Ser Barristan Selmy, though he doesn't know as much as the Mother of Dragons. In addition to the highborns, many Septons (priests of the Faith of the Seven) and Maesters know High Valyrian.

Robb probably knows a smattering of High Valyrian, though obviously not enough to read his wife's letters to her mother.

##The Doom of Valyria

The Doom of Valyria has not been expressly explained, although one of the largest fan theories is that it involved volcanos. Either way, it was a cataclysmic event that took place around 100 years before Aegon would conquer Westeros. The city of Valyria was destroyed, and much of the land was as well.

Look at the Valyrian area of the map above. It is the area to the west of Astapor and Yunkai, to the south of the Dothraki Sea, inside the white dotted square. That land mass was a solid peninsula before the Doom, but much of it is now underwater.

The land that was once Valyria is now considered cursed, and still smokes from the event 400 years ago. The sea surrounding Valyria is also considered unlucky, and most sailors prefer to sail around it. After the Doom, the Freehold fell apart. Of the forty ancient noble houses, only a few survived, most notably the Targaryens.

##Targaryens on Dragonstone

One of the least notable houses during the reign of the Freehold was the Targaryens. They had only a few dragons, and didnt do much of note. Around 12 years before the Doom, the daughter of the Head of House (Aenar), named Daenys the Dreamer, had a vision about the Doom that would come over Valyria.

The Targaryens were the only dragonriders of the Freehold to survive, although a few other Houses survived and would later join the Targaryens. Balerion (later known as the Black Dread) was one among five dragons they had. The four others died, but two more were born from eggs, Vhagar and Meraxes. Baerion, Vhagar, and Meraxes were ridden by Aegon and his sisters during his conquest, which I will probably talk about next week.

---

So that's the first bit of Ancient Essos history. A lot of this occurs during the same time period of the fighting between Children and First Men and Andals and Rhoynar in Westeros. On Saturday, I plan on posting about the nine Free Cities, the Dothraki, the Lhazareen, and Qarth. After that, the really exciting stuff comes, and we can talk about Westeros' major conflicts and the reigns of the various Targaryen kings.

Tywin gets pissed about the Rhaegar bit. Says that he's not asking Cersei (implying that he's demanding it).

Extra 3-5 lines of dialogue and we know Cersei/Tywin wanted Rhaegar to marry Cersei.  Instead he married Elia Martell. No need for awkward discussions later.

I put the all books tag on the thread for sake of the comments in case characters beyond ASOS are mentioned.

With the recent announcement of The Magnar of Thenn, Mace Tyrell, and Oberyn Martell being cast, it got me to wondering what other characters, not ""are likely"", but must essentially be cast for next season.. I've thought of a few..

- Coldhands:  after expecting him to show up last episode (thank you misleading HBO descrpition) and not doing so, I am doubting that we will see him this season.  The preview for the next episode makes it seem that the Queenscrown scene with Bran will take place... If that's taking place now, I doubt very seriously we will see the Nightfort scene by episode 10, so there's no need to have him before S4... Though he could still appear in the S3 finale to close out Sam's arc this season, if not he has to be cast for season 4. 

- Ellaria Sand:  With Oberyn confirmed, I think Ellaria has to be cast as well... The viewers have no clue about Dornish culture or customs, she would help serve that purpose to introduce the concept of Paramours, and the status of women in Dornish society..  And as the mother of a few of them she needs to be introduced early so that the Sand Snakes can be introduced later on down the road.

- Donal Noye:  With (seriously last warning to non-readers on spoilers here, if the thread title and opening paragraph didn't make it clear enough...lol) the battle(s) at the wall looming closer, and with Jon rejoined with his NW comrades, this character is essential because he serves several purposes... With no Lord Commander he essentially takes on that command, the viewers need to feel the impact of his sacrifice during Mance's attack, if it's just some random NW dude it won't work near as well, and.... ""Jon, the Wall is yours"".  Noye hands the reigns to Jon before his death, and serves as the catalyst for Jon's election to Lord Commander later on. As I said in the Coldhands section, the preview for episode 9 makes it seem that the Queenscrown scene is coming this week, and thus Jon's defection from the Wildlings... I expect him to return to the Wall in episode 10 to give his warning... Noye could be there and possibly appear as well at the end of this season, but as I've seen no casting, I doubt it.  

- ""Arya Stark"":  I'm curious as to whether we will see the fake Arya in season 4.... It defiantly is a ""must cast"", but if we do see her it'll be towards the end of season 4. The readers know her true identity is [ADWD](#b ""Jeyne Poole""), but that wasn't revealed until much later... All we know from ASOS was that this fake Arya was to be sent off to marry the bastard of Bolton.  Though it could be early season 5 before we see her... As Jaime meets her around the time he sends Brienne to search for Sansa.  So I think it will make the S4 cut.

- Dalla/Val: I think I heard somewhere that this character has been completely cut, but I cannot see how that's possible.  The whole Mance's Son swap with Gilly's son was essential to AFFC, so therefore Mance's Wife is essential.   I get Dalla was cut from season 3, but altogether? I don't think so... Now I can see her being combined with Val (Dallas' sister) and keeping the name ""Val"".  But the idea of Mance's wife and son has to be in there at some point.  I also think Val needs to be there for Stannis to offer Jon along with the offer of legitimization and Winterfell.  Combine them, yes, drop outright, no.

- Merret Frey and Petyr Pimple:  Hehehehehe


Those are my ""must haves"", if you think of some others or disagree with what I said let me know in the comments, thanks.

If you haven't watched/read up to there, my speculations *might* give something away, so I recommend you turn away or read on (and comment!) baring this in mind. If you know more because you're further up ahead in the series, PLEASE DON'T SPOIL!

Ok, so, let's set the ""stage"": Dany won the throne. She has three Dragons, the Unsullied, Jorah, Selmy and Daario as her guard/council. She has every major/important character (I'll count for this every character still alive in the series up to now) in front of her. How might she deal with them?

Starks:

-Ned (dead), which might please Jorah, though I'm not sure it would affect Dany much

-Cat, wife of the Usurper's ex-Hand. I think she might spare Catelyn of any blame/punishment. She might not be overly fond of her, but won't cut her down

-Rob, a would be usurper (wants to take 1/2 her land!). He may be given a chance to bend the knee or perish. He won't, and might demand a trial by combat. Who would be Dany's champ in that case? 

-Sansa, now wed to a Lannister, on top of all the faults of her brother and father. I feel Sansa might be in a bigger predicament than her mom, but may be spared, since she was little more than a hostage/puppet...

-Arya, spunky little scrap. Her hatred of the Lannisters and Cleganes might help her out. Problem, she's fond of Gendry, the Usurper's bastard, so might rebel against Dany to stand up for him?

-Bran, I honestly don't know what to make of him. Ideas??

-Rickon, same as above. Maybe take him as a ward to ensure the Starks stay in line + train him to be loyal?

Lannisters:

-Tywin, head on a spike or dragon chow

-Cersei, head on a spike or dragon chow

-Jaime, dragon chow, as a painful punishment for murdering her father (this one makes me sad, cause I adore Jaime)

-Tyrion, head on a spike (also makes me sad)

-Joffrey, dragon chow

-Tomnen, I'd hope she spare him cause he's a boy, and she's sort a defender of weak women and children. I'd hope that she took him as a ward too, but sadly he might just end up on a spike

-Myrcella, now belongs to the Martells, so taking her would mean the wrath of Dorne, who was loyal to the Targs cause of Elia. Pretty sure she'd be safe.

Martell: chilling in Dorne

Arryn:

-Lysa McCrazyBoob, probably spared

-Sweet Robyn, spared but hopefully taken away from his batshit mother

Tyrells:

Unless they did major ass kissing, I see a few heads in spikes for supporting the Lannisters. I'd hope she spared Oleanna

Redwynes: ? 

Baratheons: 

-Stannis the Mannis on a spike.

-Selyse to the fire. 

-Shireen might be spared and taken in.

-Edric/Gendry, no idea

What do you guys think? And what if someone else won the throne?

(Bonus points: Also, feel free to speculate about Jorah vs Daario, and who might end up as Hand).",44,6,False,self,,,,,

For those of you just tuning in there are a series of pub quizzes occurring throughout the U.S. where we're attempting to set up meetups. These quizzes are happening in the following places:


* 6:00pm: Rock Bottom Brewery, 550 106th Avenue, Suite 103, Bellevue, WA


* 7:30pm: Charlie Hoopers, 12 West 63rd Street, Kansas City, MO


* 9:00pm: O'Niell's Pub Nob Hill, 4310 Central Ave SE, Albuquerque, NM


* 7:00pm: Gibson Bar, 1109 South Lamar Boulevard, Austin, TX


* 5:00pm: Tommy Doyle's Harvard Square, 96 Winthrop Street, Cambridge, MA


* 7:30pm: West End Pub, 1801 North Lamar St # 100, Dallas, TX


* 2:00pm: The Rackhouse Pub*, 203 S Kalamath St, Denver, CO


* 6:00pm: Lucky Strike, 1201 San Jacinto Street, Houston, TX


* 8:00pm: The Cardinal Restaurant &amp; Bar, 2920 E 38th St, Minneapolis, MN


* 7:30pm: The Capitol Garage, 1500 K Street, Sacramento, CA


* 7:00pm: Lumpy's Downtown, 145 Pier Point Ave, Salt Lake City, UT


* 5:00pm: Complex, 806 E Colorado St, Glendale, CA


For those of you asking about format, this is what I know so far:

&gt;It'll be an eight round quiz. Two will be audio rounds, another will be a visual round. Each round will have a set theme. For plausible deniability's sake I don't know what the round themes are going to be, but there'll be plenty of variety.


For more information and to sign up for the event check out their facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/131066040418182/?ref=2) and check out this sweet article USA Today wrote about the event [here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/05/16/game-of-thrones-pub-quiz/2166015/). 

For my part I will be attending the Bellevue event in which I will be captain the winning team ""Tib's Titans"" though at the time of this posting my team is somewhat.....empty. Teams are capped at 6 persons, so anyone in the area is welcome to sign up here. For those of you not in my area, please feel free to recruit for your own teams here as well.

I'm going to do a recap afterwards as well, so if you plan on going, take pictures!

And remember, in the Game of Pub Quizzes you win or you.......eat....wings with....friends

Thoros of Myr wears chain mail that is a sorry excuse for red.
Various bannermen who are only identifiable because of the flags they fly otherwise they all seem to sport Night's Watch black. Characters in all black in the books were always immediately identified as Night's Watch members.

(Vent),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1fd9at/no_spoilers_newcomer_here_why_is_there_such/,[deleted],1369954309,"I am no foreigner to communities of fictional worlds, but I have found upon entering this community that the hostility is far worse than that elsewhere.

Let me say upfront that I ask this because of an occurrence in my everyday life. While what I am about to admit is something that gets a person just about lynched on the internet, I must confess that I am still in highschool, albeit at a very small and unique place.

Good, now that the proverbial cat is out of the bag,

**I wish to tell you a story**:

I *LOVE* my school, let me say that outright. They saved me from Hell. It is because of this love that I try to make sure all who come and go leave with a warm feeling towards us. But this year, an arrogant, um, *person*, was forced by his parents to transfer here from public school, and he reminded me why I hated large schools. But, not availing to my desire to leave him with a feeling of welcomeness, I tried *desperately* to befriend him. All throughout the year I failed, and in a last bid attempt I decided to dedicate my memorial day weekend to getting sucked into something which he loves and has consistently excluded mew from: A Song of Ice and Fire.

At first, I tried to read the books, because I generally prefer books, and because of his arrogance he is rather elitist in his belief that readers of the books are superior to watchers of the show. However, I failed. I love books, but I had the same problem with GRRM that I do with Tolkein: He gives way too many damn details, making his descriptions so long-winded that it ruins the pacing. So I spent my whole memorial day weekend watching Season 1. When I got back to school, I was actually excited to talk to him about it, because I had grown to genuinely like Game of Thrones and hoped that this final attempt of mine would actually succeed. But when he walked into first period, his first remark when I spoke to him was

""That doesn't count, the books are better.""

So I persisted, confident that through George Martin I might be able to leave him with a good sense of my school. So far I have failed, but I know I will succeed before next friday.",8,0,False,default,,,,,

As an avid fan of the lore and the various plots and characters, it kinda bothers me that the creators didn't make it slightly easier for our non-reading friends...

I can think of several TV shows with an ensemble cast where they do this. Imagine in the ""last week on..."" segment in the beginning of every episode, or maybe the first time in an episode where you see a particular character, they would show the name (and possibly title) of the character.

Similar when they switch location. They always begin with a location show anyway, such as an overlook of the castle at King's Landing, then they could simply put ""King's Landing, Blackwater Bay"" or something. Here I'm thinking about Alias where they would always display the name of the current city (similar to what they do in movies). Imagine if they were to rely on people's knowledge of geography and skip the names, that would be confusing.",26,11,False,self,,,,,

This is part of a series in which I'm going to go through the words of all the houses that I can, starting with the major houses of Westeros.

**Stark - ""Winter is Coming""**

The Stark's words have multiple meanings, so I'll talk about a few:

1) Winter is literally coming - As men of the North, the Starks are used to the cold, and so are the role models of all things winter. They are the most used to surviving winter as well.

2) Things can always get worse - However bad things may seem, ""Winter"" is always coming, in that worse things are always imminent.

3) A threat - ""Winter"" can refer to the Starks, in the sense that they are the ones who are coming, and they should be feared.

**Lannister - ""Hear me Roar""**

The Lannisters, in order to retain power, must create a sense of fear within the people of Westeros. Their words are a warning, and act as a reminder of the might of the wealthy Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Their words, as long as songs like ""The Rains of Castamere"", remind the population of Westeros not to mess with the Lannisters.

**Baratheon - ""Ours is the Fury""**

Baratheons are notorious for their extreme strength. They are a house closely related with the Targaryens, and are known as fierce warriors. Robert was unstoppable with his war hammer during his rebellion, and the Baratheon castle Storm's End was supposedly rebuilt 6 times to sustain all the wrath of the Gods. These words are a warning of the Baratheon's mighty strength.

**Targaryen - ""Fire and Blood""**

The Targaryens, the only house to survive the Doom of Valyria with dragons, was led by Aegon the Conqueror to control the Seven Kingdoms. There were a large number of wars, such as the Field of Fire, which were fought with dragons and swords. The Targaryens are used to war through both dragons and steel, and are willing to shed blood and douse their enemies in fire to take what is theirs.

**Tyrell - ""Growing Strong""**

The Tyrell family is portrayed as a family willing to adapt. When Mace realised the futility of the Targaryen side in The War of the Usurper, he bent the knee to Robert. The Tyrells seem undefeatable, and are always able to grow and thrive under any leadership, and their hold of The Reach allows them to remain one of the strongest houses in Westeros. Their words show how they are always able to thrive, in any environment.

**Martell - ""Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.""**

The Martells of Dorne were the last to bend the knee to the Targaryens, and did not for hundreds of years after the establishment of the Iron Throne. Even though they have technically bent the knee, they still see themselves as a kingdom independent of the Iron Throne.

In the next part of this series, I'll be explaining the words of the minor houses of the North, if you like this one :)",171,350,False,self,,,,,

Since the TV show takes some liberties in character development that the book doesn't in some instances, I wonder if they'll show Balon dying. Or if the intention is that he committed suicide. Perhaps he'll receive a a note from Theon's captors or news of his 'death'. Perhaps this 'hard man' will be so grief stricken that his last remaining son is essentially dead, and feel he has nothing left to live for. Maybe that's the reason he sent him to raid fishing villages, to protect him. I don't think of Balon that way, but it seems like a typical TV thing to do, and creates no conflicting ramifications with how the rest plays out, unless he WAS assassinated of course.",15,4,False,self,,,,,
