Are there any trees that are real-world equivalents of a Weirwood?  If not, is there a way to take a white-barked tree and cause it's leaves to grow red (like how you can dye certain flowers)?  Or would I need to create my own prop tree?

EDIT:  After some searching, I've been able to find trees with red leaves, and trees with white bark, but not both.  Anyone else?

I'm a huge reddit fan (as well as a GoT diehard). I'm currently the co-producer on an GoT fan production. We are now looking for a director to help shape and drive the production with their cohesive and imaginative vision. In addition to tapping the usual resources, I figured what better place to ask around than reddit? 

We're looking for someone who is equally passionate about the series and books as much as we are. A strong preference will be given to directors with a fantasy or sci-fi background. If you have a background in writing or editing, please indicate this as well.

This is very ambitious project and one that we're looking to do right. We know how cheesy some fan-made series or renditions can come off and we're determined to achieve only the highest production value and quality possible in order to do this amazing series justice. We want to give something to fans to help tide them over until the start of the next season.

Right now we're in the very nascent stages of the project. Both myself and my co-producer have led very successful crowd fund raising projects in the past. Additionally, we are both working industry professionals and have waited to cash in all of our collective favors for this particular production. All we need now is a leader for this project to help get the ball rolling.

Pay is deferred in the sense that we're willing to negotiate a flat fee for your services upon completion of funding for the project. We deeply value your time and skill and believe that you should be fairly compensated for both.

Hopefully we'll continue to update you guys as production chugs along. We're shooting for a release ~4 months from now but will maintaining a blog detailing our progress. 

Please feel free to either pm us or email us (YouKnowNothingProductions@gmail.com) and let us know a little bit about yourself and your interest in Game of Thrones. Please also include a resume, reel, and quote for your services.

We look forward to reviewing your submission.

Sincerely,

The Production Staff",7,11,False,self,,,,,

She is one of the most physically, mentally, and emotionally abused characters in the series, and maintains her role as Alayne Stone while being the only person who can keep that little shit Robert (or i guess now Robin) Arryn in check, while never losing her cool.

Cersei then concocts her plan to expose Margaery as a traitor and have her eventually executed.  The whole time I am reading from her perspective I can't seem to understand her unconditional hatred towards Margaery and why she is so convinced she needs to die.

The motivation for Cersei to be wary of the people around her seems to stem from Joffrey's demise in ASOS.  From the events that took place I thought that Cersei was convinced Tyrion and Sansa were behind his murder.  Does she suspect Tyrell involvement as well? I cannot remember.  Even if Cersei thought the Tyrells were involved why would she believe Tommen to be in danger?  If they were to kill Tommen as well they would lose their last chance at marrying the heir to the Iron Throne.

When Cersei goes to visit Margaery when she is imprisoned, Margaery tells her she would never love any woman who married her son.  This comment seems to be the truth of it. It seems to make no sense because wouldn't Cersei need a woman to marry Tommen so that their lineage could continue?",23,9,False,self,,,,,

Did anyone see GoT before reading, and then read through ACoK before season 2? Or even read AGoT before watching Season 1 and then watched season 2 without reading ACoK?

If so, how was your enjoyment level of either the books or the show altered?

I kind of blew through AFFC in excitement to get back to my favorite characters, so some stuff is a little fuzzy for me. Is there any actual evidence that Margaery is guilty of anything she's accused of? I know most of it is Cersei's ploy to get rid of her, but I feel like there's much more to Margaery than we've discovered so far, I don't believe she's the innocent she reads as.

Secondly : Loras. I don't think he's really hurt, I think he's smart enough to suspect what Cersei is trying to do, so he faked a mortal injury. I think he's just biding his time on Dragonstone.

Third : Varys. What the fuck? Who does he REALLY serve? I know he says he serves ""the realm"" but does anybody have any clues as to what his endgame is? (crown Danaerys maybe? Aegon? Or is he like Littlefinger and just wants to create as much chaos as he can so he can make his own power-grab, but then again, he's already pretty powerful. Not in the same way as say Lord Tywin was, but you really can't fucks with Varys, or fucks with anybody without him knowing.)

Fourth: Bran. Since his 'weirwood chapter' it seems like all the Ravens in Westeros have been much more talkitive. (Snow! Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! or in Theons TWOW chapter they shout ""Theon!"" while he's talking with Stannis.) Do you guys think that's Bran? We already know he's been watching Theon from the weirwoods, and he can 'see' from multiple ravens at once. 

Lastly: Predictions for TWOW. 
Arya - I have no idea, but it involves her being a badass. 

Bran - Becomes somewhat omniscent, and does badass shit from his liar up in the 
North.

Brienne - Dies. Her ambush of Jaime somehow goes awry.

Boltons - Get fucking smashed. 

Cersei - Robert Strong wins, but Cersei is still 'soiled.' Pretty much I see the rest of her storyline as a continuation of what happened to her towards the end of ADWD. More shame and humiliation for Cersei.

Tyrion, Jorah, Victarion, Selmy, Dany, and their respective armies set off for westeros (Possibly with more dothraki?) Of course GRRM would never let us have that much awesome, I'm sure half of them will die I'm thinking Selmy and Victarion... :( 

Jaime is going to die, not sure how but I feel it coming.

Davos finds Rickon, but that won't become important until book 7.

And hopefully, (pleasepleaseplease) Jon Snow gets saved by Tormund, but the peace between NW and the wildlings is broken (because Tormund fucks up some crows trying to save Jon, wildlings join in, brawl insues.) and Jon must leave the Wall, hopefully to go ride some Dragons with Dany.

(Also, one little reaction. When Ghost starts growling and freaking out in the last Jon chapter, my mind immediately went to the RW. Everytime a direwolf growls, a Stark (hopefully almost) dies.)

EDIT: spellingnstuff

EDIT2: I just had a thought about Benjen. I noted that Benjen is in all the appendices in the books, and his name isn't bracketed, which makes me believe he's still alive somewhere. In regards to R + L =J : I don't think Howland Reed is the only person who knows the full story of the Tower of Joy. If Ned confided in anybody about it, it would be Benjen. I think that reveal (if it's true) will either come through an encounter with him, or a Bran warg trip.",27,8,False,self,,,,,

* Who exactly are Roose Bolton and his son?  He was one of Robb's men, right?  And he was instructed to take Harrenhal and send his son to take Winterfell, right?  So where is the betrayal?  Did he betray Robb at the RW; how?  Who's orders, if anyone's, was his son following?

* Who is Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions?  Who do they serve and how did they get Harrenhal?

* Dany was to be betrayed thrice, for blood, gold, and love.  Blood was the magii, gold was Xho/Pyatt, and love was Jorah, right?

* What is up between Littlefinger and the Tully girls?  He loved Cat; does he feel affection for Sansa, or was that just a rue to get Lysa mad?  Why did he have Lysa to kill Jon Arryn?  Why did he tell Cat what he did about the dagger in AGOT; did he have motivation to begin a Stark-Lannister war?

* Why did Stannis go to the Wall; just to be a good guy?  Why would he care to have several castles and the Gift over Dragonstone?  Why does he care about a Lord Commander being chosen, and care to have Jon rule the North?  Does it have to do with Robb choosing Jon as his heir (why hasn't Jon been told yet)?

* I heard in another thread that LF told Tywin about the Sansa-Willam marriage idea.  How would he know about that, though?

* I heard in another thread that LF conspired with Olenna Redwyne in killing Joffery.  How and why?

* I heard in another thread that Reek is the Bolton boy or something.  Is this right?",11,0,False,self,,,,,

It's started [here](http://fr.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xkeeh/j/c5ncvpf) and now I would like to expand it here.

Couldn't we imagine that Jon Arryn knew about L+R=J? "" The seed is strong"", his last words, might not mean the incestuous relationship of Cersei+Jaime, but rather suggest he knew about the survival of House Targaryen...

This info (L+R=J), let's assume known by Varys, Pycelle and maybe Baelish later, would have endangered the Realm as well as the Baratheon claim to the throne and the power of the Lannisters. It would lead to to Jon Arryn's untimely death, killed by proxy of Lysa Tully by any member of the three factions aforementioned. Baelish then manipulates Lysa Tully to fool her sister with the raven sent to Winterfeel saying that she thought the Lannisters were behind Arryn's death.""

Ed Stark, while knowing all along who the parents of J. are, bring him to Winterfell as a babe to hide him from stags and lions alike -who killed all the Targaryen's heirs. [when King Robert visits the  Winterfell crypt, I remember reading about the unease of Ed Stark when the king is still full of hatred for Targaryen and says something like ''I oughta kill every last one one them'']. J is Ed's nephew after all. Even if the Targaryen murdered his father and brother, blood and honor are more important to the austere Lord Stark. 

J grows up in the North under the new made-up identity Ed invented. Jump 15 years later, after Lysa Tully's raven, investigating in KL, Ed randomly uncovers Cersei and Jaime's incestuous relationship based on a dying man's word he misunderstood. Then Joffrey, who's been told the true nature of J when he became king, kills Ed against his mother's will because he knows he is the last powerful/vocal person to know he isn't the rightful heir in two ways. Not only Ed knows he is not a Baratheon but he also knows the identity of the lawful, albeit natural, Targaryen male heir to the iron throne. 

Still not convinced? When J gets to the Wall, Aemon Targaryen, being so freaking old, knows all along who he is and schemes to see his kin become lord commander of the night's watch, arguably the highest office J can hold. For now. 

**TL;DR** **Jon Arryn's knew about R+L=J, died for it, Ed Stark only go lucky (in a way) and the Targaryen may still rise again**

So what do you think, Reddit?  I was just having fun at first but got into it. Can you punch holes in my speculation?

As for me, I promise I'll stop mixing milk of the poppy, hippocras and firewine before going on r/gameofthrones/.

(Possible Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xmhg5/why_i_think_asoiaf_would_be_a_good_thing_for/,PunkTheBrad,1344009294,"Let me explain. While ASoIaF has mature themes (some obviously more extreme than others), it has qualities in it's message that I prefer teenagers to learn over the qualities in, let's say teenage reading like Harry Potter or Chronicles of Narnia (I'm just using these as examples, don't hate me for my choices). What I mean by this is that most teenage literature, and even adult literature for that matter, seem obsessed with the concept of duality: black and white, good vs evil. There is very little grey area in this literature. Granted, sometimes you as a reader are led to sympathize with or even understand why an evil character is performing his or her evil acts, but they are ultimately still viewed in a negative light when our hero triumphantly explains why they are incorrect in their actions and assumptions. It does make for good reading, but in the end it's not the best lesson to learn.


What I'm trying to get at is that ASoIaF teaches the reader to look at a person or a situation from every possible angle and perspective, and to not jump to conclusions. This is a character trait that I would very much like everyone to possess. Every character in the book has a good reason for the way they act (although some reasons are better than others). [AGot and ASoS Spoilers](/b ""In my opinion, there have been only 2 characters in the entire series that are completely good or completely evil, and they both get dead."")   


[DISCLAIMER] I do realize there is other literature that throws out the concept duality, but I think very few do it as well as George R. R. Martin. Also the reason I say teenagers is because I have worked in middle and high school, and teenagers very much so have a ""black and white"" mentality (but don't tell them that because they are obviously smarter and more worldly than you). They do not look at all of the facts and usually jump to conclusions; and unfortunately this usually leads to small minded adults, and we all hate those. 


I didn't mean to write this much, how did this happen...

EDIT: I have commented about this to some people, but I figured I should say this here to save time. I need to make two points. First: I am not saying that Harry Potter or Chronicles of Narnia are in any way inferior to ASoIaF. I can't stress that enough. I used those as examples simply because they were the easiest examples to use. Second: I do not think that there is anything wrong with the use of duality in literature. When I say duality in this context I mean that there is a very clear good guy (or group of good guys), and a very clear bad guy (or group of bad guys), and there is some struggle between good and evil. I do not mean it to be taken as any novel written with duality in mind is in any way inferior to those that aren't. ",168,111,False,self,,,,,

[Possibly Spoilerish]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xmvrs/for_anyone_familiar_with_both_the_books_and_tv/,Fratboy37,1344022570,"I was re-watching GoT for the first time after reading the books, and for the most part I am extremely distracted by some of these new 'exposition' scenes.  

After reading the books it's clear that these scenes are meant to convey the backstory of ASOIAF that can't be captured without using flashbacks or internal monologues.  The end result, however, makes all of the information feel extremely forced to me - here are a few examples that really bugged me:

**Littlefinger and Ros (1.07, ""You Win or You Die"")**
- The main thing I'm thinking is, ""Why the hell would Littlefinger, a man who clearly knows how to play the Game, open up and go on about some of his ambitions with Ros, a girl he just recently met?""  The monologue comes out of nowhere, and he just keeps going *on and on*.

**Littlefinger and Varys (1.05, ""The Wolf and the Lion"", and 1.10, ""Fire and Blood"")**
- These are actually my favorite of the exposition scenes - it shows just how different these people are approaching things than the honorable Eddard Stark.  The main thing that bugs me about 1.10 is that they're talking about information that, theoretically, you'd think they know about each other since they've served on the Small Council for some time.  Some examples that would have been realistically been covered already are Varys and Peter's origins, their plots and counterplots, and Varys becoming a eunuch.  Seriously, that last one.  He mentions it at least 57 times with each exchange he has with everyone.

**Robert and his Kingsguard (1.03, ""Lord Snow"")**
- This was actually a clever way to pull this off.  The only thing that bugs me is, again, like above's exchange with Varys and Littlefinger, this information would realistically be known to them over the course of 17ish years.  It might have made more sense if this scene was done with the KG and Ned Stark, or Stark's bannermen, who really don't know each other (they actually did have Jaime open up to Jory Cassel about Robert's cheating ways at some point).

I'm not saying the information conveyed in these scenes are useless (quite the contrary), but in some episodes there seems to be the one new scene where ALL of the relevant information/backstory is crammed into one really bloated exposition scene.  It feels like lazy writing, especially because it's surrounded by magnificent scenes from the books that convey information in a much more interesting and subtle way (ESPECIALLY since these scenes are deprived of the third-person narrative and internal monologue of the characters).

Not to say I hate **all** the new scenes, just the exposition ones.  The exchange between Robert and Cersei regarding their marriage/Lyanna (**1.05, ""The Wolf and the Lion""**) was done well, Arya and Tywin's team-up was pretty cool, and Joffrey's ""sex"" scene was absolutely delicious characterization.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on how the show handles exposition.  I'm really interested to see how they'll cover the rest of the relevant backstory in later seasons without using flashbacks (especially [Massive Spoiler Theory](/g ""R+L=J"")).",37,7,False,self,,,,,

I just finished A Storm of Swords and wanted to share my opinion and speculations.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xn6i4/massive_spoilers_for_asos_do_not_read_if_you/,tutelhoten,1344033242,"First off, I enjoyed this book a lot more than the first two. They were amazing to read, but part of it is that I had already seen the first two seasons of the show before I started reading the books. I'll just ramble on if I keep on going like this so I'll separate my favorite characters into separate paragraphs in no particular order. Let's start with Robb:

Robb, when he was alive, was my favorite King after Renly was assassinated. Once Robb took up his cause against the Lannister's I had hoped he would succeed in every way. Stannis' defeat on the Blackwater made me see that that would never happen and I hoped he would just bend the knee, for his sake. The scene where he died was one of the best scenes in the book. The drum in the background, seeing everything from Cat's view, ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards."" Ever since Roose Bolton left Harrenhal I felt Robb would die at the Twins, but I never let myself believe it. I always hoped Robb would get his own chapters, but this way works too. The mental image of him dead with Grey Wind's head sewn on his will always be with me as well.

Bran: What can I say? I haven't read about him with Coldhands yet, but that should prove to be exciting. I hope he finds his three-eyed-crow. If he learns to take control of Hodor as he does with Summer, that would be really interesting. Still no word of Rickon too...

Theon: Where the hell is this guy? (Rhetorical question) I can only hope he's already dead or dying on Pyke. Hopefully the offer him to the Drowned God for whatever reason they see fit.

Daenarys: Freeing all the slaves was a very noble thing to do. Staying in Meereen for the time being seems smart as well. I think she should have killed Jorah for what he did, but that's just me. He sent a letter from Qarth and the only reason he saved Dany was because he notified Robert that she was pregnant. No wonder he was exiled. I suspect she and Stannis form some sort of pact and hold Westeros against the Others for no other reason than a wild guess.

Arya: My favorite character. I shed a tear when I thought she was dead. Seeing her name pop up for another made me happy as hell. I called her going to Braavos as soon as Hagar gave her the coin. She still has to make it there though, I guess. What she did with the Hound was no more than he deserved, no more than he earned. He saved and killed, and Arya did what was fair in my eyes. It put a smile on my face that she got Needle back as well. My guess is that she will become a Faceless (Wo)Man and hopefully kill some more people on her list. Whether it is her in person, or Nymeria, I can not say.

Jon: This seemed to be the only character with a happy ending (as happy as he could hope for). The raven flying onto his back was great and being Lord Commander even greater. (Fuck Allister Thorne and Janos Slynt) Not much speculation with him, maybe a murder attempt in the next books. I'm glad he didn't decide to take Winterfell though, no northman would follow him if he burned down the godswood.

Tyrion: What a miserable story it is for him compared to the last book. I have rollercoaster opinion on Tyrion, one chapter I hate him, the next I like him. I would have thought him and Sansa would get along better, considering their mutual hatred of most of the Lannister's, but Sansa was already too damaged to even try and see that. He is a lot like Littlefinger in that he does stuff just to fuck shit up. I couldn't help feel really sorry for the Red Viper when the Mountain pounded his face in while mocking him. I can't imagine how Tywin's death is going to go over. No speculation with Tyrion.

Jaime: It's funny how giving a character their own chapters can completely reverse your opinion of them. I hated him (and still do for the whole Bran thing) but I actually felt bad for all the shit he gets for being the ""Kingslayer"". What are oaths to the king when the king is batshit insane? It seems to me by the end of the book, he's trying to right his wrongs one at a time. I can see him being named, ironically, Hand of the King, and if not him I think it will be Doran Martell by way of Myrcella or his seat on the council.

Beric Dondarrion and the BWB: Beric is easily one of the biggest badasses in this book. I would be too if I knew I couldn't die. One of my biggest hopes for the show is that the scene where he fights the Hounds is filmed and the capture the intensity of the whole thing. The epilogue was awesome, I'm guessing Thoros raised Cat from the grave? I think it's very obvious that Beric is actually Azor Ahai and his sword is Lightbringer. I mean, it lit on fire from his blood. And R'hollor did in fact have another use for the Hound, to make sure Ayra got to Braavos. I could be wrong on some or all of that of course.

Sansa: Her last chapter was very creepy, in my opinion. I couldn't shake the feeling that the marriage with Lysa Arryn was a ruse because Petyr always seemed eerily obsessed with Sansa, I'm guessing because she's Cat's daughter.

Last but not least, Littlefinger: I don't even know where to start. Everything that has happened in these books seems to be caused by him. He set off everything by making Lysa think he was in love with her. He plays the game of thrones perfectly and no one thinks he is a danger. He gets sent off on these missions by the Lannister's to keep their faith, but all the while he's plotting against them and everyone else. He reminded me of the Joker when he made that speech to Sansa on the boat about making moves that have no purpose. I think he will marry Sansa, making him Lord Protector of the Vale and Lord of Winterfell in the process. It's hard to guess what a man like Littlefinger will do next when he's so random.

So there it is, if you would like me to explain anything further just ask.

If a legitimate child was born to a father who was illegitimate (i.e. a bastard), would he take his bastard father's surname? i.e. the surnames based on which kingdom the bastard is from (Snow, Storm, Stone, Sand, etc.). Do we have any examples from the books? I don't recall any.

The reason I ask is: couldn't those children be mistaken for bastards because of their surnames? That would be kinda sad given the stigma that being a bastard carried, and the added kick in the teeth is the fact that they're not bastards but are mistaken for them.

I kinda just wanted to bring this up as a discussion topic. What do you guys think? Feel free to bring up cross-cultural or historical examples of how illegitimate children were treated if you know of any.

This is merely speculation, GRRM is a master of surprise, so this is definitely not canon.

Okay, so, Bran and Frodo (both have a synergy/reliance with their partner), as Samwise and Hodor (both halfwits) are alike.

Most of us are familiar with how LOTR ended, and how most of us think that Frodo was the true hero.

However, Tolkien did not regard Frodo being the hero of the LOTR series. In fact, he proclaimed that Samwise was.

Evidence: http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/6238/did-tolkien-really-explicitly-consider-sam-the-true-hero-of-lotr

Though the meaning behind the name of 'Hodor' is a mystery, there are many theories about his name. Of course, this is not his real name, Old Nan does say that his true name is 'Walder', which translates to 'Commander of an army'.

Some speculate that Hodor is the son of Ser Dunk the Tall.

I do recall from a while ago I read something that 'Hodor' translated to 'The carrier of the world'. I cannot recall where I read this, I have searched everywhere for it, but I have reached no avail.

If anyone else could share their thoughts or speculations, it would be awesome.

First of all, I've read each book only once about a year ago so there might me some mistakes, feel free to correct me.
Ever since I read the books I was wondering about how do the unequal winter/summer cycles work and yesterday I had a theory.
The thing that led me to this theory was the prophecy that maegi made about daenerys:

When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry, when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

So naturally people may thing this just means ""never"" but I thought what about if it is meant more literally? In order to have such different lengths of winters and summers obviously the planet of ASOIAF is a lot different from our Earth. In my opinion, strong magma flows(or just internal geological processes) beneath the ground are shifting the planets center of gravity and makes its axis shift. The doom of valyria is proof that the planet is pretty active inside. However, my theory is that the axis shifts pretty drastically, about 180 degrees. 
Here is how it looks:

[AWESOME GRAPHICS](http://i.imgur.com/RulGL.jpg) 

Option 1:
So at the end of summer when the shift begins the earth continues its rotation as usual, but also pivots around the red axis that is pointing at the sun.
Gradually, over several months/years(?) the planet is positioned upside down. Since the rotation of the planet has the same direction, for people on it it seem like the sun is still rising from the east, however, in reality because everything is upside down the North is South and East is West. 
You probably wonder about the comet. My theory is that it moves around the sun as well but below(or above) the planet so they don't usually see it, but during the shift as the planet turns for the people on it it seems like the comet is passing through the sky. That is why some people are saying that it's a sign that winter is coming. Because of the uneven cycles the comet is probably not going to be visible on every shift. Of course because of the shift seasons change, some winters are colder than others etc. 

Option 2:
This one is pretty much like the top one, but even crazier. In option two, the planet pivots around an axis that is perpendicular to the direction of the sun, essentially gradually exposing the south pole of the planet to the sun rays and the north hemisphere is engulfed in darkness for a few months maybe. Of course with darkness temperatures drop drastically and white walkers rise. Maybe this is the reason the night's watch is called NIGHT's watch. Because during this huge night is when they're most needed and when white walkers make their attacks. After the planet has almost completely rotated the permanight ends but the winter continues, but with a few hours of daylight. So the monthslong permanight is that crucial period during that humans need to defend the wall.
Same as above they see the comet during the rotation. 

Well, that's pretty much it, I'm not sure if I explained it properly, so if there's something unclear, ask away... ",11,14,False,self,,,,,

1. I know he tries to be authentic, and perhaps the poor nutrition and hygiene of people ""back then"" could have caused more males to go bald young?

2. Actually I'm wrong and the proportion of bald to haired men is reasonable, and it's just because I watched the show first that when I read about a familiar character being bald when the actor isn't it surprises me.

Notice, that everything I say below contains some spoilers from 2 seasons and the first 3 books.

As all of us noticed there was no (almost or at all) magic before the dragons were born. and it was mentioned in the ACOK too, hence we can suggest that all the magic came with dragons. the dragons ""died"" a number of centuries ago, hence the magic was gone with them. in the beginning no one believed in magic, and the gods were only symbols for different Houses, the part of their history. 

in parallel with existing religions a new religion was born, the religion of R'hllor, the red priests, and they assumed that all the powers are a gift from their god. but not only them posses powers, other people not having any connection to R'hllor posses some too, and most of those powers cam with the birth of dragons (warg visions of Stark children).

why there was magic behind the wall before the dragons? I guess the wall is a thing that divides Westeros in two parts, by any mean (as we know it is made by magic [I suppose alike the ""wall"" in the [Legend of the Seeker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Seeker)]). There was magic beyond the wall in the beginning, because the Others woke up, and there was no magic west to wall because the ""source"" for it, the dragons. were born only in the beginning of the 2nd book (season 2)",7,2,False,default,,,,,

But my wife, despite being open-minded about it, isn't historically a fan of the fantasy genre (though she does like historical and political/dynastic intrigue). We watched the first season episode 1 last night and, honestly, I was a little disappointed (it was ok but I had high expectations). Ned, the king, and the dwarf seem like interesting, complex characters, but others seemed cartoonishly flat or cliches (sorry, I don't know their names, but the barbarian warrior, the blonde exiled guy, the queen). Again, ordinarily, no big deal and the intrigue seems like it has a lot of potential (and the stuff happening to the north). But my wife is grossed out by the incest, and I myself thought it was a cheap way of making us immediately dislike flat-seeming cliche evil characters, rather than drawing me in to their own complex twisted world, for instance, say like the Joker or other villains aimed at intelligent audiences. 

But anyway, I'm sure it all gets great, so what I'd like to know is how many episodes the hive thinks it will take before my wife and I will be completely hooked/addicted, at which point we'll buy the whole season (AppleTV) rather than one episode at a time while we test the waters.

BTW, I apologize if any of the above offends any fans, I actually want to become one, I have faith due to rave reviews, and I trust y'all's collective opinion/advice on this. Thanks in advance!

soccer scarves are awesome. the house sigil would be on two ends so when you have it wrapped around your neck they hang to either side.   

the house motto would be written on the inside so when you lift it above your head it'd show, depending on how you hold it, it would display the motto, with the sigils still showing above your head.   

**Hear Me Roar!**   
  
**We Do Not Sow!**   
  
**Winter is Coming!**    

**Ours is the Fury!**

I could be completely wrong on this, but for me the Starks have always been the main characters and the good guys, and the Lannisters are usually seen as the bad guys (although occasionally badass good guys). I think part of this is due to the Stark's affiliation with Honor while the Lannisters seem to stick to ruthlessness and trickery.    

But I think it goes deeper than that. From the start we are shown the Stark's home and given quite a bit of information about that. The Lannisters are almost described as kind of tagging along with Robert without really being wanted there. I think Catelyn and Ned even have a conversation very early on along the lines of ""Goddamnit Ned why are the Lannisters coming, they're a bunch of douchebags."" Then there's the whole deal with Bran and the complications with that that make them seem pretty horrible.  

But most people seem to like Tyrion pretty much, and he usually isn't as much of a terrible person. And in ASOS I think most people tend to start hating Jamie less, if not altogether liking him once he gets his own POV chapters.  


So I have three questions.  

1.) Do you agree with me that Starks=good and Lannisters=bad? (This might be a very straightforward question, but I haven't really talked to anyone that reads the books, and it's certainly more open ended than most books).  

2.) Do you think GRRM intended it to be that way?  

3.) Do you think your opinion would be changed if the story had maybe started out with the Lannisters in Casterly Rock or Kings Landing and gave a lot of background about them? The way I see it is if I saw the Lannisters as the main characters and wanted them to succeed, I might fall more into the attitude of ""the ends justify the means"" and turn a blind eye to some of their tactics.",21,12,False,default,,,,,

Seriously, what the fuck is up with him? At first, I thought he was just obsessed with justice and order to a step just higher than Ned, but as I've been reading on I'm realising that he might just be the most entitled douche in the entire series. I know everyone's feelings about Daenerys and Cersei, but holy shit Stannis.

First, he tries to hide it by claiming that it's all for duty and that he wants none of it. Still, he swears that the iron throne is his. Whatever, understandable...ish. I don't see why he doesn't, say, trade the iron throne for Storms End since he *did* want the seat of his household, but I guess he's just stubborn. It's still pretty pathetic that he pretends he doesn't want it at all, but oh well.

[ASOS](/b ""Then he gets to the north. Again, he was acting... kingly, but not really too much worse than some other kings we've seen."") 

[First few chapters ADWD](/b ""But he progresses so quickly. Next thing you know, he's demanding that the Night's Watch takes part in the realm's issues and starts demanding Jon does what he says no matter how ridiculous. He takes their meagre provisions and demands more, more, more. When Jon offers the counsel he asks for--just as with Davos who undoubtedly means far better than Jon even--he just blusters and threatens if he doesn't get the answer he wanted like a damned child."")

He's easily my least favourite character in terms of being downright unlikeable. There are some others I dislike more for being just treacherous and psychotic [Major ASOS](/b ""E.g., Frey, Joffrey, Bolton, Shae... the usuals,"") but I find myself having to stop reading onward because of Stannis.

Tyrion wanted to laugh at her. It would have been so sweet, so very very sweet, but it would have given the game away. *You've lost, Cersei, and the Kettleblacks are even bigger fools than Bronn claimed.*
All he needed to do was say the words.

Instead, he looked at the girl's face and said, ""You swear you'll release her after the battle?""

""If you release Tommen, yes.""

He pushed himself to his feet. ""Keep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think they can use her ... well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways."" His tone was calm, flat, uncaring; he'd reached for his father's voice, and found it. ""Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes."" *If she thinks me such a monster, I'll play the part for her.*

Cersei had not expected that. ""You would not dare.""

Tyrion made himself smile, slow and cold. Green and black, his eyes laughed at her. ""Dare? I'll do it myself.""

His sister's hand flashed at his face, but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out. Osfryd moved to her rescue. ""One more step and I'll break her arm,"" the dwarf warned him. The man stopped. ""You remember when I said you'd never hit me again, Cersei?""  He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks. ""Untie her and remove the gag.""

The rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands. She cried out in pain as the circulation returned. Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned. ""Sweetling,"" he said, ""you must be brave. I am sorry they hurt you.""

""I know you'll free me, my lord.""

""I will,"" he promised, and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow. Her broken lips lefta smear of blood on his forehead. *A bloody kiss is more than I deserve,* Tyrion thought. *She would never have been hurt but for me.*

Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen. ""I have never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm. You've ended that. I will hurt you for this. I don't know how yet, but give me time. A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid.""

In war, his father told him once, the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees. No matter that they're as numerous as they were a moment before, still armed and armored, once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again. So it was with Cersei. ""Get out!"" was all the answer she could summon. ""Get out of my sight!""

I have heard a lot of complaints about her chapters being boring and causing the 4th book to be unreadable to some people.  I can definitely understand that.  I still enjoyed them a lot but I can see where people are coming from.

If you look at what she does through the currently released books, it is a very boring story.  I like her character and I enjoyed her interaction with Jaime (allowed GRRM to show his real self much more), but why are we even following her at all in Feast for Crows?  She is out to find Sansa (maybe Arya?), that is her purpose.  Yet the reader already knows where Sansa is the entire time.  

I think that her ""quest"" would have been much more interesting if we did not know where Sansa was.  But it just feels like a waste of time the way it is setup.

Then at the end of Feast she gets mauled and (almost?) killed by Catelyn.  She yells something ( I always assumed ""Sansa!"" or something like that).  Then she does not even come up in Dance with Dragons.

TLDR: Brienne has a large focus in Feast for Crows but why?  What is the point of her actions?

I just wanted to see if anyone could give some insight.",32,8,False,self,,,,,

Tyrion wanted to laugh at her. It would have been so sweet, so very very sweet, but it would have given the game away. You've lost, Cersei, and the Kettleblacks are even bigger fools than Bronn claimed. All he needed to do was say the words.

Instead, he looked at the girl's face and said, ""You swear you'll release her after the battle?""

""If you release Tommen, yes.""

He pushed himself to his feet. ""Keep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think they can use her ... well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways."" His tone was calm, flat, uncaring; he'd reached for his father's voice, and found it. ""Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes."" If she thinks me such a monster, I'll play the part for her.

Cersei had not expected that. ""You would not dare.""

Tyrion made himself smile, slow and cold. Green and black, his eyes laughed at her. ""Dare? I'll do it myself.""

His sister's hand flashed at his face, but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out. Osfryd moved to her rescue. ""One more step and I'll break her arm,"" the dwarf warned him. The man stopped. ""You remember when I said you'd never hit me again, Cersei?"" He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks. ""Untie her and remove the gag.""

The rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands. She cried out in pain as the circulation returned. Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned. ""Sweetling,"" he said, ""you must be brave. I am sorry they hurt you.""

""I know you'll free me, my lord.""

""I will,"" he promised, and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow. Her broken lips lefta smear of blood on his forehead. A bloody kiss is more than I deserve, Tyrion thought. She would never have been hurt but for me.

Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen. ""I have never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm. You've ended that. I will hurt you for this. I don't know how yet, but give me time. A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid.""

In war, his father told him once, the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees. No matter that they're as numerous as they were a moment before, still armed and armored, once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again. So it was with Cersei. ""Get out!"" was all the answer she could summon. ""Get out of my sight!""

Tyrion bowed. ""Good night, then. And pleasant dreams.""",4,3,False,default,,,,,

(I figured since they talked about how strong belwas fought that knight in a danny chapter and it spoke of his cumbersomely long lance that he couldn't aim well that there must be a wide variety of lance lengths with greater length meaning lower accuracy but longer reach). How would the mountain lose a tilt against any of the people who regularly win these tourneys. Rhaegar and Ser Barristan were not notably tall and would likely have roughly the strength of any other knight. Ser Gregor is &gt;8 feet tall and ~30 stones (420 pounds) of mostly muscle and apparently has deadly accuracy with a lance. Doesn't that mean The Mountain could be easily wield a lance many feet longer than other riders, with accuracy, that aren't of mythical proportions? Also wouldn't ser gregor stand an enormous chance of winning the melee aswell considering he wears nearly impenetrable armor and anyone who stands a chance at beating him has to quickly dance around his blows (not so easy on horseback) which isn't really realistic in a melee?

I understand the need for valiant knights like ser barristan and rhaegar winning tournaments to crown the queen of love and beauty, but putting The mountain that rides into a battle of champions would be like bringing lebron james to a game of pickup backyard basketball.

That gives GRRM another 5 years to write the 6th book, which would only leave maybe 2 years max for the 7th book.

Do not take it seriously. I just thought it was funny and somewhat possible.

I'm only one book and two seasons in, so forgive me if this has all been covered.

This theory involves the following characters:

* Jon Snow

* Arya Stark

* Eddard Stark

* Robert Baratheon 

* Lyanna Stark

* Jaquen H'gar of Braavos

* Brienne of Tarth
_________________________________________

Here we go:

Jon Snow is actually Lyanna Stark and Rober Baratheon's son, and, therefore, the True King. From what I understand, Robert Baratheon was nowhere near Lyanna when she died. So, this is plausible. Eddard doesn't reveal this fact because the Starks will then be tied by blood to serving Robert.

This also explains why Eddard doesn't/can't tell Jon Snow and Robert Baratheon who Jon Snow's mother is. If either one finds out, Eddard could be in serious shit. This is the true dishonor that Eddard doesn't tell anybody. He'd rather have his wife believe he committed adultery than admit to Jon being his sister's son.

There are two scenes that come to mind especially. Both on the King's road:

1. The first is when he's departing with Jon Snow. ""When I see you next, we'll talk about your mother."" When he sees Jon Snow next, the boy will already have taken the oath and be forced to live up north. Also, his debt to Robert Baratheon will be paid as Eddard is going to serve him as hand. So, it will be safe to tell Jon Snow that he is actually a king, not a bastard. Also, Eddard has never trusted the Lannisters. He might have feared that Jon Snow would have been killed if left with Robert.

2. The second is when he's on the King's Road with Robert. ""Nor will I."" This proves that Robert Baratheon has no idea who Jon Snow's mother actually is. Eddard seems to bite his tongue when he's talking to Robert about this.

_______________________________________

Arya Stark finds out that her ""half brother"", Jon Snow, is the true king. Gendry could be full or half brother to Jon Snow. It doesn't really matter. Anyways, upon discovering this, she decides to seek revenge for her father's murder by the Lannisters.

She takes the coin that Jaquen H'gar gave her to Braavos where she trains to become an assassin. This training takes years. 

This is where my theory get admittedly very silly. Sorry. I'm still in love with the idea despite its ridiculousness.

After years of training in Braavos, she discovers that, with magic, she can travel through time! Not far, but far enough to exact revenge for her father's murder. This explains why we never see Brienne or Arya together. I doubt we ever will.

I know screen time is precious and they can't do long backstories and even some things would sound awkward if they said it like that but some characters are so badass in the book and so undistinguished in the show.

What is a ""halfhelm""? 

Historically speaking, it's often called a ""Norman helm"" or ""nasal helm"". But since there are no Norman's in Westeros, GRRM calls it a halfhelm. http://i.imgur.com/wBdx3.jpg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_helmet

Why does all the food have honey in it? 

Historically, sugar was imported from the orient (places such as Egypt, Iran and India) though Sicily had some cultivation. Therefore it was very expensive for Europeans, leaving them with the only options of using honey or sometimes sugarbeet syrup  to sweeten food. Beekeeping was much more widespread and rather easy compared to growing sugarcane. Most villages and monasteries kept an apiary. 

What is a ""bowl of brown"" / ""trencher""?

One of the most common meals for medieval people, and evidently for those in ASOIAF was the ""trencher"". It was a bowl of hollowed out bread with vegetable soup added, meat if they were fortunate enough. For the lower classes, it was a way to soften up stale bread too. It's possible that ""bowl of brown"" is not an actual trencher but likely just an actual bowl with brown colored soup. Regardless, actual 
""trenchers"" are mentioned in ASOIAF. Soup was a very common food in the middle ages and many inns kept a large kettle that they never emptied. ",90,36,False,self,,,,,

Summer and winter are described as ~5-10 years, how long is Autumn/Spring? It is said to be summer in AGOT and finally winter at the start of TWOW (hence the title). However,  summer only starts changing into winter during ACOK ([Bran's chapter, 28](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maester#cite_note-7)).

The realm bleeds in these times of war,
Things have changed forevermore,
In the north something stirs,
A freezing gale will pierce your furs,
The Others and the dead walk hand in hand,
And seek to descend upon the land.


Across the sea the narrow sea,
The dragon seeks to set the people free,
With Fire and Blood we wish her well,
For across the seas theyve rung the bell.


Hoorah! The boy king lies dead!
Only a shame he didnt lose his head.
Poison took him, its understood,
Margaery will never lose her maidenhood.


A warg, thats what you are,
To truly fly you must go far.
To the north where the great wall stands,
Hide in the mountains, fear the foes small and grand.
Into the wild you must go,
To find that lying three eyed crow.
Brandon the Broken, we love you dearly,
Step ever so lightly, understand that ever so clearly.


The wolf girl flew, away, away!
To leave this wretched city, she cant delay.
Though her image is now forever tainted,
With Lord Littlefinger, shell be acquainted.


Forever defiant the free Stark stands,
Traveling boldly across the lands,
Though bold she is, she is no duelist,
Shell look at you, Valar Morghulis


A bastard at the North he does not talk,
Whatever is asked of you, you must not balk.
A wild woman, who thinks him no liar,
He has won her heart, this Kissed by Fire.
Though to his brothers, he seems so hollow
In his heart hes still a crow, as black as shadow.


The wench has kept her word, that much is no lie
But how I wish to strike these chains and fly,
A Sword is all I truly need,
With one I find, my word people heed.
Yet remove that from me and what am I? Oh sweet sword hand good-bye!
Now Kingslayer, what are you now?
A cripple, thats all. Now bow.
Your sister waits for you in the Red keep,
To all others you seem a creep.
Well bugger them all, and bugger you too!
You are what you are, if they only knew.


The night is dark and full of terror,
The deaths of Seaworths son seemed no error,
A dagger to the throat, thats all itd take,
To prove to his king that her powers were fake,
But how can he deny what he saw in that cave?
A shadow dark, though he must be brave,
Through treason it seemed the only way,
To show his king the light of day.
Now the wall twould be his seat,
Seaworths counsel is quite a feat.


Finally, Young wolf go forth!
We have your back, THE KING IN THE NORTH!
Though good of heart, and kind of soul,
He is not incapable of sending heads a-roll.
Now to the Twins he marches his forces,
Through wind and rain, he leads the horses.
But wait Your Grace! Heed our warning!
The Freys will leave your people mourning!
The lions claws are long and sharp,
And pluck the kings life like some great big harp.
His mother cries and weve lost our senses,
A sham of man, death dispenses.


But what of one other, he who is shamed,
Simply because theres little else to blame.
The half-man has no friends at court its shown,
Out of the water, his defenses are blown.
When words and steel fail you both, 
What else to do but loathe?
Oh Tyrion, we didnt forget!
So you should not sweat. 
A man has come to free you see yes its true!
Time to bid this dungeon adieu! 
But wait you say? Theres something more?
A task you say that you abhor?
The chain and quarrel will serve you well,
Now you must leave, for they will ring the bell.


The realm will bleed for years to come,
But the men will drown their sorrows with wine and rum,
Some men are honest, but most a liar.
For this is the Song of Ice and Fire

He needed King's Blood, and Stannis is the true king after Robert (not to mention he is genetically closer to Robert according to every law of Biology), so shouldn't his blood be better suited for the spell?

I'm never going to ~~read~~ listen to (I am listening to Roy Dotrice's reading of ASOFI; apologies for any misspellings) GRRM right before I have to sleep again. That was a dumb move on my part.

Rob is dead. Catalyn is dead. Rob's death is so much worse than Ned's was, for me. I've now had two and a half books to fall in love with Rob where I only had half of one, or a little more, for Ned.

Anyway my melancholy relating to the Stark family runs pretty deep now. Everything, except for Rob's physical battles, have gone poorly to say the least. Arya is in the Hound's custody, I'm assuming since he had no reason to actually run her down. Sansa is wedded, although not yet bedded, to a Lanister. Jon looks to be leading a motley group of Black Brothers against a much larger force. Bran and Ricken are walking directly into that conflict. Everything is bad, nothing is good for the Starks

I've grown to hate characters I used to love and love those I used to hate. I despise Tywin, I sympathize with Sansa over Tyrion, and I've always hated Circe and Joffre. Jaime is the lone, bright light, in the Lanister line. Now all I have left, that I'm invested in, are Arya, Jaime, and Jon.

It seems beyond reasonable to hope that Jon, now legitimized, would be able to defeat the wildlings and take back the north in the name of Stark. It seems even more unlikely that the Stark line will continue another generation. Maybe Jane will have a Stark child, and maybe Jon through Egret/some future wife, but it is bleak.

I will add Lord Frey to my list of prayers. That petulant 90 year old toddler

Anyway, I say all of the above, with disappointment and ennui but also with a sad sort of ecstasy. I've very rarely encountered a medium which could make me feel anywhere near as much emotion as I'm feeling right now. Kudos to GRRM. 

Anyway, rant over. ",21,0,False,default,,,,,

So, I have this theory about Jon Snow. I believe that he has one of the best possible claims to the iron throne and this is why:
#1) Lyanna Stark dies at the Tower of Joy in a Bed of Blood for undisclosed reasons. I believe her death was caused by child birth, more specifically giving birth to the boy that would become Jon Snow whom she created with Rhaegar Targaryen (Rhaegar could have raped her or consensually impregnated her, either way I think its his baby) 
#2) This is why Lyannas dying words are Promise me, Ned. She clearly asked Ned to say that Jon was his son instead of hers because she knew that due to the babys father and the royal claim that came with that fact was more than enough reason for Robert Baratheon to hand down the order to have the child killed (not to mention the fact that this was the love (or rape) child of the woman he loved and his sworn enemy, Rhaegar)
#3) So, in an effort to grant his dying sisters last wish he claimed that the child, who would be Jon Snow, was his bastard. Another piece of support for this theory is that at no other time in the book do you ever see or hear of Lord Eddard Stark compromising even a shrivel of his honor, so why this one time? 
#4) There is also the fact that he never ever divulges any information about Jons mother to anybody especially Jon himself, besides when he mentions to Robert Baratheon that her name was wyella which could easily have been a made up name. This lack of information shows that there is definitely something fishy going on as you would think that after 15 years he would at least given Jon a little morsel of information.
So In short, Jon Snow is not Jon Snow, He is Jon Targaryen, with dragon blood flowing through his veins

At first I thought that he might be taking the place of Sixskins but [ACOK/ASOS](/b ""Sixskins is an extremely minor character, I don't remember him saying or doing anything of particular note, aside from sending Orell/Eagle to claw Jon's face up"" ). It seems like a big actor to put in what is really a pretty minor role. I am only a few chapters into AFFC so it could be that Sixskins plays a much larger role that I am so far unaware of, and they are casting with that in mind, but I just don't see what they are going to do with such a great actor in such a minor role.

Jon Snow whines about being a bastard every two pages. *As he broke his fast, Jon remembered he was a bastard. Damn, thought Jon Snow, I wish I was my father's son, and not a base born child. ""Here you are, bastard"" said someone and Jon was sad, and wished he wasn't a bastard.*  Bran is a cripple. *Damn, I wish I wasn't crippled, so I could walk. Unfortunately my legs don't work, thought Bran the crippled boy as he broke his fast, watching people around him walking on their own two legs whilst he was defenseless as a suckling babe*. Brienne is ugly. Everyone in Cat's family is dead. Sam is a fat coward. *Coward, said the mean man. Sam wished he wasn't so craven and* WE FUCKING GET IT.

Obviously, with and since [Spoilers All](/s ""Ned Stark's"") death, the show has become even more popular than before. With a few of the upcoming deaths, however, I feel that much of the show's light and casual fanbase could be turned off from continuing watching: [Spoilers All](/s ""Robb, Catelyn, supposedly Arya, Ygritte, etc"").

I suppose the blows could become less harsh depending on how the creators of the show intend to portray them... but I really don't want the deaths to be less meaningful and separate from the books just so the show can maintain ratings. That being said, I can imagine that the [Spoilers All](/s ""Red Wedding""), depending on how it's done, can really scare off viewers and could be altered from the books a bit.

What do you guys think? Are the climaxes of the next books too much for some viewers to bear? I've heard a lot of arguments about how putting the [Spoilers All](/s ""Red Wedding"") at an episode 9 could allow viewers enough precious time to recover and keep watching... and I can't help, but agree.",3,0,False,default,,,,,

Skipped ahead to Dancing Dragons, more 'blah blah blah nobody is resolving shit', got tired of it, looked at Wiki for the book, sure enough, nothing fucking happens.  

The amount of movement in the plot of both of these books could easily have taken place in half a book.  Time moves at different speeds for different characters, and yet still nothing is happening.

In the show, she seems much more loyal-- ""If anyone tries to hurt you, I will cut their face off!"", etc.-- but perhaps that's just to amplify the dramatic effect of her ultimate betrayal. Perhaps the Lannisters will torture or extort her in some way to get her testimony-- maybe she'll believe that what she's saying will help Tyrion and/or Sansa in some way. And, frankly, I can't see Tyrion strangling her to death in the TV show, although, of course, that could very well happen. I was even wondering if the writers might go so far as to have Shae escape with him. I feel like they must be setting something up by changing her character so much for the show. They take the time to hint at Shae's mysterious past during the never-have-I-ever game with Bronn, and they choose to make her foreign as opposed to low-born Westerosi, so maybe her past will come into play. If she's from Bravoos and she goes with Tyrion, maybe that will influence/consolidate the storyline of season 5?"")

Thoughts? Speculation? Any idea on what you would do if you were a writer for the show? I really didn't care for book Shae at all, but TV Shae is one of my favorite characters, so I'm curious to hear what changes you expect in her storyline for the coming seasons. We already know from season 2 that the show writers are very willing to stray far and away from the strict plot of the book.

Edit: I just did a search that turned up [a week-old thread on this very topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xqlxb/shaes_role_in_season_34_asos_spoilers/). The OP speculates that [speculation] (/g ""Lord Tywin will be the one to kill Shae, which will be the act that ultimately drives Tyrion to kill his father. Shae's betrayal (or perhaps just the degree to which she betrays Tyrion) is variable in this scenario."")",22,10,False,self,,,,,

Around page 533 of A Feast for Crows (softcover) during Brienne's chapter, Meribald starts talking about war and the common folk involved in the battles. He states:
""There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. Theyve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.

Then they get a taste of battle.

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after theyve been gutted by an axe.

They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when thats still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands theyre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there its just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They dont know where they are or how to get back home and the lord theyre fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world

And the man breaks.

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear thembut he should pity them as well.

I think this was one of the best passages of the series so far. When we read about battles and wars, all we focus on is what Robb or Jamie or Tyrion is doing, you don't really think about the common people who fight in these battles and die for lords and kings they've never even seen.",41,27,False,self,,,,,

1. Jon Snow dies at end of book 5, and is brought back by Melisandre. Death ends his oath to the Black, so he is free to become lord of Winterfell

2. The wildlings, seeing Jon Snow killed, rise up against the black brothers and kill most of them

3. Snow takes them south to meet Stannis and defeat the Boltons. Stannis is mortally wounded in battle, names Jon Lord of Winterfell before his death.

4. The battle is won because Manderly stays within winterfell, letting the Freys and Boltons go out to fight; he openly switches allegiance to Stannis and attacks from the rear

5. Bran is somehow going to free Theon (This is in the sample chapter on his website) by trying to get Stannis to behead him in the weirwood (and uses the crows to shout his name)

6. Dany defeats her enemies outside Mereen and finds out who is behind the Sons of the Harpy; she finds a replacement ruler and leaves Mereen

7. Victarion destroys the fleet around Mereen and uses his ships to bring Dany's armies back to Westeros

8. Robert Strong (Cersei's champion) is revealed to be Gregor Clegane, who didn't actually die from the poison

9. Sansa: who cares, she's boring.

10. Connington will take storms end and the Martells will learn of Quentyn's death, causing them to realize there will be no marriage and through their support behind Aegon.",53,4,False,self,,,,,

I decided I wanted my character to be an Iron Islander - I really like the feel of the Iron Islands; the barren ports packed with outcasts that operate almost completely independently of other holds, but we all have a fundamentally different image of the Iron Price/Iron Law. 

My friends are adamant that the Iron Price exclusively applies to taking via bloody combat. As if nothing can be legitimately obtained unless it is peeled off of a corpse, but it seems like if that were true it would be the Blood price and eventually no one would be able to pay it. 

I think that the Iron Law is grossly misunderstood. No society can survive when they are religiously seasoned to steal and murder to get their way every single time they want something.  Everything would collapse within a few generations, so somewhere along the line someone corrupted the very concept of the thing - someone like the Greyjoys. That's a giant part of my character actually, that the Greyjoy's are a disgrace to the Ironborn and all they stand for. I believe that the Iron Law must have once been about earning, not taking. Paying the Iron Price for a title was truly deserving it, not murdering everything bipedal in the vicinity until people yield to command.  

I still love the Survival of the Fittest motif, but it seems terribly over-exaggerated in the show. I don't really know about the books, I haven't gotten the chance to read them yet - soon though. So, let me know if Martin clarified this himself over the course of the books. 

tl;dr - I don't think the Iron Law was always about taking what you want, I think it was about earning it.   ",13,5,False,self,,,,,

Both are a lot of fun. I'm a fan just like many are.

That all being said. I'm a bit concerned with this community as a whole. 

A few of my observations:

.1. If you don't read the books, you mean nothing to others.

Redditors on this subreddit are extremely harsh towards others who just watch the show. Some people don't like to spoil it all. The problem are the people who hold themselves in such high esteem that they criticize other greatly for not knowing facts from this collection of books. If you haven't read the books, then you apparently aren't welcome.

.2. People on here take George R. Martin as some sort of literary god.

He wrote and edited only a very few TV show episodes. 

From 1986 - 1996 he pretty much did jack shit until writing the first book of this series...that came out in 1996. It didn't even become popular until the show started. (Cue literary hipster: ""I read it before it was popular"")

But everyones hooked on this series of novels like he farts rainbows and barfs gold. They are a good set of books, but nothing to obsess over. He's an okay writer at best.

.3. Pretentious dicks, pretentious dicks everywhere!

This seems to be a place that all the people who like to prove they are better than others by reading a fantasy novel, come to trash talk others and prove their almighty internet godliness of useless information. All so they can feel great about proving somebody wrong on a fact no one cares about in the normal everyday working world of reality.


This is reddit. A community on the internet for people all over the world. It's sad seeing people who post reddit worthy material, get constantly bombarded with a bad response...then to have those responses become the top voted.  Even on a post that continues to get upvotes.

Sure, it happens all over reddit...but lately it happens here more than anywhere.

Be kind to your fellow redditors. You can criticize, sure. But don't be a massive dick about it.

So Crows Eye won the kingsmoot, correct? And his plan is to just go around raping and pillaging everything? As far as I know, he's still out in the Arbor sending ships up the river by Old Town, so that can he later win the Iron Throne.

Now Victarion is trying to make his way to Dany so that he can marry her, taking her away from Euron in hopes to avenge his wife.

He was obviously poisoned and died in seconds.

My question is who did it? The chapter it happens in is a Tyrion chapter. Unless I missed something, he definitely didn't do it. He never slipped away to drop something into his wine or to poison the cake in the kitchen. In addition, he is as horrified as everyone else is when Joff dies.

Yet at the end of the book when Jaime lets him out of his black cell, he tells Jaime that he did indeed kill Joffrey. Why was this? Did I miss something where he actually did it? If he was innocent, why would he purposely lie to the only person in the entire world who liked him?

[Not sure how far forward this goes in the books...](/g ""I think I remember reading somewhere that it was indeed the Queen of Thorns who did it to save Margaery from a life of Joffrey. Is this revealed in ASOS anywhere or later in the series?"")

After no word from Teefury (I think its too obscure), i put this on Teespring (Basically its Kickstarter but with T-shirts).

The link is here: https://teespring.com/manderlysmeatpies

Its basically like Kickstarter. You pledge to buy, if 100 people pledge to buy, the shirt gets made. If it doesnt reach the goal in 2 weeks, no shirt.

[edit] Working on adding more shirt colors!

The north remembers....the flavor!

I finally finished this grueling Lord Manderly design/parody logo I've been working on. It took several revisions with the background because I couldn't decide how White Harbor was going to look like. The scales took a while but was easy enough. It was the crenelations that was a pain because I did it as a brush, and because of that going in to shade it was a huge pain and I had to do it individually. Anyway, enjoy. edit: thanks for the support guys. if it comes up for voting on teefury, i will update you guys. if this doesn't do well enough to get on teefury, i will make it a teespring campaign to try to get it for you guys.

I was like BAM, I've got to throw a GoT Dinner Party.  It's happening this Thursday for my friend's birthday.  Here's the menu so far, and any other ideas/suggestions are welcome.

I got a lot of ideas from this site: http://www.innatthecrossroads.com/

* **Appetizer:**

Jalapeno Poppers labeled as Dornish Fryed Peppers with cheese

hard cheese &amp; bread from Flea Bottom

* **Salad:**

Sansa Salad from King's Landing--spinach, pansies, feta w/ strawberry vinegarette

* **Soup:**

Crab Stew from the Iron Islands (cream based)
or
Corn Puree from the Eyrie

* **Main:**

Beef &amp; Bacon Pie from The North

---would like to have another option here, maybe vegetarian

* **Dessert:**

Lemon Cakes from Casterly Rock or Chocolate Mousse from Storm's End

* **Drinks:**

Red &amp; White Wine with Arbor Gold labels on it

Pale Ale with Riverrun Labels on it--relevant name here would be appreciated

Sig Drink: Tears of Lys

Thanks in Advance!

* Edit 1: Changed Sig Drink from Dragon's Blood Punch to Tears of Lys on werewolf1803's link

* Edit 2: Added hard cheese &amp; bread from Killer_Sloth's suggestion

Remember that scene in Episode 3 where Robert I, Ser Barristan and Ser Jaime were talking about their first kill in battle? Jaime said that his first kill was ""one of the outlaws from the Brotherhood"". [AGOT](/b ""Obviously this kill was either before or during Robert's Rebellion, because he just so happened to - well, stab Aerys Targaryen in the back."")

This story does not pop up in A Game of Thrones, the first book. What does pop up in both the book and the series is Ned Stark's order to Lord Dondarrion to find and capture The Mountain. [AGOT] (/b ""Once Ned Stark gets executed by Joffrey"") however, the search party eventually becomes a fellowship of highwaymen, which we now come to identify as the Brotherhood Without Banners.

I haven't gotten very far into ASOS, so I might answer my own question if I read further into the book, but in any case - what would make more sense: Was the Brotherhood created by Dondarrion and his men? Or was it a strange, almost traditional organization created by lords and men-at-arms as far back as the rebellion, Aegon's Landing, or even earlier? It's a pretty inconsequential inquiry into a faction that's somewhat overshadowed by the major families in Westeros, but there's something to be said for the major difference in origin.",10,10,False,self,,,,,

For anyone who wants to know it takes 6-10 days to deliver to the US/Canada and delivery is 12 (~$14) and the book itself is 10.71 (~$13) 

I think delivery to the rest of the world is ~25

I just marathoned the event after the Red Wedding and Joff's weeding and Jamies return. I had a couple questions, wondering if someone could clarify

Okay, so what did Littlefinger gain from sending the 2 dwarves to Joff's wedding? Are we supposed to believe that he knew EXACTLY how the whole situation was going to play out and lead to Tyrion pouring Joff's lethal win? Because that's kind of farfetched..unless I missed something significant in his explanation.

Also, When Jamie returns to King's landing Tywin offers to send him to Casterly Rock with Tommen as a ward and squire...Isn't Tommen king? Doesnt he need to get married and have some babies immediately to continue the 'Baratheon' line? (I know it's going to be years till he can do this, but if I were Tywin this would be my number one concern)

Tyrion figured out that Joff hired that man to kill Bran, but I didn't quite understand how he made that deduction. GRRM didnt really make it seem like figuring out who was responsible for that had been one of the thing Tyrion had been mulling over, during that conversation with Joff about daggers at the wedding breakfast did something really obvious happen that made Tyrion figure it out? I think I missed it. 

Why did Bran want to go through the black gate immediately? Didnt he want to go find Jon? You'd think that because he was so close to him (geographically) he'd go for a reunion before heading beyond the wall. Also did he take Summer through the gate with him? I don't remmeber him doing that, but I feel like Jojen would want him to keep Summer around as much as possible.

I love fantasy football, and I love the fantasy elements in the Game of Thrones series. So why the hell not bring them together and do fantasy football a little differently this year?

I'm searching for some enthusiastic Redditors to join me in a ""Game of Thrones"" themed fantasy football league. It's going to be a fun season of battle with lots of blood shed and no love lost, and hopefully I can find a group who is up for the ""spirit of it"". 

The two divisions are Winterfell and King's Landing. 

The teams will be named after your favorite character from the series and have a profile pic accordingly. Each weekend we will bloody our swords and grow one step closer to controlling the Throne. (Speaking Ill of the Baratheons is encouraged.)

I'll be updating league stories throughout the season, and it should be a pretty fun and hilarious league once we fill it up. 

The league [is here.](http://fantasy.nfl.com/registration/leagueDirectory?leagueType=private) look for ""A Game of Thrones"" 

If you think this sounds like a fun idea, comment why in a couple of sentences so I can discern the true fans. I'll PM you the password to join up!

*Please note this league is for serious, weekly players only. If you quit midseason... I'll send Sandor (the dog) to ""rape your fucking corpse""!*


**EDIT: It's the 17/08 and we're still looking for 4 more players! Drop a comment or PM me to join up!**

**EDIT2: It's 18/08 and we have 2 more spots left! Those that have joined have done an awesome job at making the league look badass so far. Hurry on up and join us! :) Even Hodor is playing.**

Picture, picture, picture, picture and then finally discussion about the show. You have to go down to the 13th item to get another discussion thread, and that's the official one that the moderators here put up. Is anyone else tired of this sub-reddit being dominated by mugs, cakes and fan-art? Don't get me wrong, a lot of the fan-art is great, and I've seen some hilarious comics. But I feel like for a subreddit dedicated to Game of Thrones, it's difficult to actually discuss Game of Thrones.


Yeah, it's the off-season, but there's still a ton of news about the show each week. And yeah, there's also the problem that a lot of the people know what's going to happen and a lot of them don't. But it seems to me that that should generate even more discussion--readers can discuss how they think certain events will (if at all) play out, while non-readers can make predictions.


Game of Thrones is hands down my favorite show of all time. But it's disheartening that I find myself discussing it more on /r/asoiaf than I do here. /r/breakingbad had a self-post only day, as an experiment and I thought it was fantastic. Perhaps  we could try that here as well?

For whatever reason I thought there was just one type of dead, and that 'Whites, the others, and the dead' were all different names of the same thing.  But when Samwell [ASOS](/b ""first kills an 'other' with the dragon glass, but then gets owned by a 'white' later on, I didn't get it.  I seem to remember a passage where there is a brief explanation of how the 'others' are some type of magical creatures, while 'whites' are simply undead brainless things or something."")  Any help with this?",13,11,False,self,,,,,

Excuse my bad english, but it was so much fun I have to tell this story. 

First I chosed to play as King Rob Stark in the war of the independence of the North. I was in war with the Iron Isles,  Joffry King of the Iron Throne and of course the Lannisters. I already had captured Jamie Lannister, got the alliance with the Freys and stood with 42000 Men in the riverlands. My first decision was to marry Rosalin Frey because without the backing up from the Freys it would be hard to win against the Lannisters and the Iron Isles. 

My second decision was to send 7000 men back to the north to fight the invading Balon Greyjoy. After some weeks it seemed like a mistake because the Vale had chosen to support the Iron Throne and the Lannisters deployed an Army of 40000 men, too. But the old gods favored Rob. So in an epic battle against Tywin Lannister where I was outnumbert by 40000 to 35000 men, I got the chance to duel Tywin personaly. In a short fight Rob managed to kill Tywin and his armies moral got an heavy hit and his men routed. Because Jamie was in my prison Tyrion the Imp become the new Warden of the West. 

I started to led my army to Kings Landing to besiege Joffrey and my allies from the riverlands won some fights against the vale and the rest of the Lannisters army. In the mean time Stannis managed to kill Renly and slowly build up an army, I had to imprison my mother Catelyn in an unsuccessfull attemd to free Jamie and the iron men started to lay siege on some coast territories in the north. My siege of Kings Landing was an success and Joffrey, who was busy fighting Stannis offered peace to me. I accept and was the new King of the North. Arya returned alive to Winterfell and Sansa married Joffrey, who was now my ally. My 7000 men in the north won the fight against the main army of Balon Greyjoy and started to free the occupied lands.

As Rob arrived at home I had to make a decision what should happen to my mother. Because of some deaths in the war of the riverlanders she was heir of the Riverlands. It was a hard decision but I sentenced her to death through duell. Her fighter was Edmure Tully, Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. Rob managed to kill him in an easy fight. So Catelyn inherits the Riverlands. But only for very short because she lost the duel and was now rightfully killed by her own son who is now the King of the North and the Lord of the Riverlands. :)

I won the war against the Greyjoys and captured Theon, who I sentenced to death, too. He chosed a duell and managed to wound me, before I could crush his traitorous head.
Rosalin gifted me in the meantime two children, while the King behind the Wall Mance Ryder had trouble to unite his tribes. So the nightwatch had a calm time. The winter is coming and Joffry struggles against Stannis, but there is no winner to be seen. The Imp had problems with revolting Lords and peasants and messages arrived that Daenarys Stormborn managed to raise an army with dragons... 

So far this was my game experience. My next ambition should be to take Harrenhal back from the Lannisters because I have a de-jure claim of it from the Riverlands. ;)",24,20,False,self,,,,,

These are the first batch I've done as mostly a mock-up. I know they're a little blurry in places, and some of the blacks seem red (printer was low on ink, apparently). Those are the issues that I'm aware of that I'll try and improve in future pieces but once I get them just right, I'm hoping to be able to add them in the selection of my small jewelry business.

So, you guys are my target audience for these. Looking for your thoughts. The Direwolf and Kraken are in two brushed silver bottlecaps meant specifically for crafting, so they're plain, whereas the Lannister Lion is in an ""upcycled"" Lionshead beer bottle cap, so the back looks like [this](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3371981415_7c38c4a8e9.jpg). Are plain caps a better idea to keep them a little more ""neutral"" or do you prefer the idea of matching caps with sigils? 

I'm curious about what to mount them on, too, and since I haven't gotten to that part of the supply orders I suppose its time to ask... maybe chain, or some kind of plain black cord or ribbon, or would you see yourself wearing something a little more elaborate and built around each pendant to coordinate? 

I've been kicking around the idea of bottlecaps like above made into fridge magnets as well. I'm sure the possibilities are endless! If you guys have any further criticisms, critiques or suggestions I'd love to hear them. I wanna be able to make stuff for people to really enjoy. ",7,9,False,self,,,,,

I don't think this theory will come to be until the and of The Winds Of Winter in the final Samwell Tarly chapter, if it does at all but I think it will! This is what got me thinking. Particularly at the end of A Dance With Dragons when Kevan Lannister dies by Varys, I was so shocked and surprised by that, that I totally missed that Grand Maester Pycelle got his head bashed in by Varys. It was only a line or 2 and I was still reeling from Kevan being Crossbowed in the chest! So then I realized there will have to be a new Grand Maester in Kings Landing in the Winds Of Winter. Kevan was thinking before he was shot that he didn't want the Tyrell's to get anyone else loyal to them on the small council because it was already 3 Lannister loyalists (Grand Maester Pycelle, himself and that dude who Cersei hated but is Kevin's Father in Law) tied with 3 Tyrell loyalists : Randall Tarly, Mace Tyrell Hand Of The King and Paxter Redwyne the Admiral of the fleet. The 7th woman out being Lady Nym of Dorne who is on her way. But now Pycelle is dead, and Kevan is dead. Leaving 1 Lannister loyalist on the council, who is pretty useless and old. Now here is where the theory comes in. Jon Snow sent Samwell Tarly to Oldtown to become Maester of the Night's watch as you all remember I'm sure. But whose to say Jon Snow has all the say in this? We know nothing of how the politics of choosing a Maester, and especially a Grand Maester work. Pycelle is the first Maester to die who I think we will see the process of him being replaced. I don't think the Tyrell's or Oldtown would go for Qyburn and his possible necromancy, and the Tyrell's want more Tyrell loyalists on the council. Samwell Tarly's father is on the council, so maybe for once Sam Tarly's dad will give him a chance at respect and push for Sam Tarly as Grand Maester. On that note, Sam Tarly could be far more useful to Jon as Grand Maester of the realm in Kings Landing then he could on the wall. He can push for policy (not that his father would be okay with this or that Sam has the guts right now, but he could get them) but he can push for policy that would benefit the wall (if Jon even stays there and comes back to life which we all think he will). Or if he doesn't he can secretly assist Jon in his war with Ramsey Bolton assuming Jon comes back to life. Plus those people Samwell ran into in Oldtown who have an interest in helping Daenerys might also push for him to be in Kings Landing so he can help their Dragon Queen once she arrives, and he could be helping Jon and Daenerys. That might be pushing it with the Daenerys thing, but hey it's another thought. So what do you all think? Feel free to disagree as I just came up with this on a whim!

Let me be clear: I want this to happen.

I'm not worried or concerned about G.R.R.M.'s writing pace, because I am honestly hoping the show *does* catch up. 

I want it to be necessary for the the show producers to buy G.R.R.M. more writing time, by filming the backstory, what happened in Westeros before Season 1.

It has been done before, when the star of *Spartacus: Blood and Sand*, Andy Whitfield, died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma between the first and second seasons. In order to allow the studio time to find a new lead actor, the writers created a a prequel season: *Spartacus: Gods of the Arena*. It was the origin story for many of the main characters. And the fans loved it.

I want so badly for Robert's Rebellion to be filmed. It *needs* to be filmed. Do it for the television audience, who haven't been privy to Ned's fever dreams, who don't know who Arthur Dayne is because he only exists in the memories of others. And for the book readers, who want to see it all come to life.

I want to see when Stannis met Davos, and became lifelong friends over that shipment of onions. I want to see the moment Aerys realizes his old Hand did not come to King's Landing to save him; I want to see Tywin give the order, and release his men to wreak havoc on the city. I want to see Catelyn saying her vows in the sept, and Eddard, standing where his brother should have been. I want to see the Iron Throne surrounded by dragons skulls, as the view pans slowly to Jaime on the throne, lounging, waiting.

The Tower of Joy, enough said. To see Sean Bean hold Ice again. Oh the feels.

I love this subreddit and I check it daily, but I've got some a couple suggestions to make it better and maybe more ""noob friendly"" (for a lack of better words). Feel free to add ideas of your own, and hopefully mods can pitch in too!

1. **Put back the [Episodes Discussions Threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ic100/game_of_thrones_episode_discussions_tv_spoilers/) on the front page**. Seriously, I love these. I watched the season 1 after it aired and at the time, S1 Episode discussions were pinned on the front page so they were easy to read. I really enjoyed reading other people's reaction to what happened in each episode, shock, anger, sadness, joy... It's the same for season 2. It was there a while ago (I think in the top bar, just like on /r/asoiaf/ right now, ""Discuss ADWD Chapters"") but now it's gone, and I have to go find the link in the FAQ. I think these posts are an extremely fun way to learn more about the episode and dive into the story.

2. **Archive and pin all the AMAs done by GOT staff members and actors on the sidebar at the right**. Just like in /r/breakingbad (go check it for those who want to see what I mean). I remember when I watched all 4 seasons of breaking bad for the first time 2 months ago, I checked the subreddit (just to see how it was) and I was SO EXCITED to see all the AMAs there (tons of major actors), waiting for me to read them ! Of course I watched all the episodes before, not to get spoiled. If my memory is good, on GoT, we have Miltos Yerolemou's AMA (Syrio), we have Amrita Acharia's AMA (Irri), we have the AMA of someone who helped creating the fantastic opening sequence, I believe there was also the AMA of someone who was an Extra on set, and there is also an AMA of someone who helped creating the Dothraki langage. All of these are VERY interesting to read for newcomers and for people who just missed them in the first place. They are also an enjoyable re-read material. Finally - and I think its the most important point, an archive of these AMA on the side bar, like on /r/breakingbad may ATTRACT more interesting AMAs. If I were one of the actors of the show, and someone suggesting me doing an AMA on Reddit with a link to /r/gameofthrones, I would be reassured and attracted to do this, seeing and checking others AMAs first (and reassuring myself about the seriousness and the quality of this exchange with fans). Lets face it, Syrio's AMA was fantastic, very fun, it really shows everything that is good in the AMA system. [Link for the lazy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sapz2/hello_i_am_miltos_yerolemou_i_am_an_actor_you/)

3. Finally, **some ""major"" posts in this subreddit could also be pinned**, something like ""Post of the Week"". It would need to display EXTREMELY relevant information about the show. On the top of my head : major characters final cast, new trailer, major event, whatever. Sometimes, relevant info about the show is just buried under Jon Snow's drawings, GRRM memes and other stuff, and it just disappear even if it has a LOT of commentaries ! (but sadly people dont upvote these posts enough, so they move away from the front page too fast).

Anyway here you go, hopefully something useful in here for this subreddit. I think it could make it a more welcoming and enjoyable place. Cheers! ",4,10,False,self,,,,,

[Book 4 spoiler](/b ""Something is going on with the Martells and they have Myrcella going across a desert but someone betrays them...but I can't remember who anyone is... and Arry is in Braavos at some suicide church"")

Basically I am looking for advice on how to get started, or reassurance that it will get easier/better soon. 

Not looking for any spoilers beyond the first half of book 4, please -- but maybe a recap of what is going on in the first half of book 4 will help me.

Also, maybe I should just start book 4 from the beginning again? Will that make it better or worse?",14,2,False,default,,,,,

I personally hope that some of her internal thoughts are changed to dialogue (ex: ""not my hair, Ned likes my hair""). Also since Roose Bolton did practically nothing in season 2 besides get dismissed so Robb could chat with women, I hope that they build him up on the show to the point where you actually know who he is as a common audience member when he stabs Robb.

And now it ranks up there as a must watch. But...

I got the first book for my (then) new Kindle, this is like 3 months ago.  Since then, I've been on and off with the book, and apparently I'm now 80% through.  But it's a chore.  I have no interest in the first book, no interest in the characters, and don't really care for it.

Yet I'm happy to watch the shows over and over (well, about 3 times now) and I get involved, I laugh, I cry, I get attached. (Roll on S3!)

So, does this mean there's something wrong with me?  All my friends are telling me the books are so much better, but yet I disagree with them.  Are there any other TV show fans but can't get into the books?

TL:DR - GoT TV show rocks; The books are a chore

Edit: Thanks for the comments all, I just wanted to reply on a couple of themes that have cropped up...

- I do enjoy reading, I've been through all the Sword of Truth books, got through the first 4 Wheel of Time books (I stopped because Rand is an effing pussy and needs to grow some bollocks, but I guess that's for a different subreddit!), I even made through the first 3 Thomas Covenant books - now THAT'S a hard read!  But yes, I do enjoy a nice long book.  Although, as someone else commented, I think my attention span has become shorter, because I've moved away from the 'epic' novels, and tend to spend more time on shorter books (Discworld, The Brentford series, V:TM Novels and the like).  Maybe that is part of it.

- I can't really explain why it's not grabbing me, maybe it's because I'm used to fantasy novels having a defined 'hero' and a defined 'antagonist', where GoT makes you think about whom you would support and whom you want dead.  It's all about perspective.  Maybe it's something completely different to that, which I've not figured out yet.

- I am generally a fairy slow reader anyway, it just seems to be taking longer to read than I expected (maybe that's from not having the actual paper copy of the book in my hands, but a digital version), I'm one of these types that tries to absorb each word (don't get me wrong, I'm a proficient reader, just not a speed reader)

- I think I'll stick with it and at least finish book 1, but take a break and jump into something a little more light-hearted before embarking into the realms of the second book.",28,0,False,self,,,,,

An interesting qoute from Tyrion speaking to Sansa in a Sansa chapter. When Sansa is belittled by Joffrey in court, she is stripped naked and beaten. Tyrion strides in and puts a stop to the humiliation and beatings questioning Joffrey's protection of the Honor of his future Queen.

For me it equates to the problem of cognitive dissonance and perhaps the questionable actions of Christianity witch hunts during the middle ages.

I just finished SoS, and I still don't understand why the Kingslayer is so despised, when he helped Ned and Robert win the rebellion. ",83,43,False,self,,,,,

So, I come here. I'm slightly confused about the ending of Theon's story in book II, where he sends Reek to go off and fetch some dudes and they come, kill the northerners outside Winterfell and then sack the city -- but aren't they bannermen of Roose Bolton, who is a bannerman of the Starks? Isn't he currently staged at Harrenhal and still loyal to the Starks? Why is Reek able to convince Bolton soldiers to attack Winterfell? I'm thinking maybe I missed something earlier in the book -- no, I must have, because it all seems so out-of-left-field and off the charts.

So, could a kind soul please explain?

The majority of Westeros (everything but the land beyond the wall) is known as ""The 7 Kingdoms"".  However there are 9 regions: The North, The Vale, The Crownlands, The Westerlands, The Stormlands, The Iron Islands, Dorne, and the Riverlands (which I understand are not considered an 8th kingdom because they were conquered by the Ironborn). This still leaves 8 kingdoms. The only thing that I can think of is either the Iron Islands aren't considered a kingdom either and are in some way grouped in together with the Riverlands, or Dorne isn't considered one of the kingdoms because of their tendency to act independently of the rest of Westeros?

[ADWD](/b ""So, after finishing ADWD, I started wondering what could happen to The Night's Watch now that Jon Snow is (presumably) dead. I have come up with a few scenario's that seem likely to me:

Scenario 1:
Jon Snow is revived by Melisandre, her being a red priestress, and in the end hightening the tension between the black brothers but somehow maintaining order. This is not entirely unlikely, as Beric Dondarrion has been brought back from the dead numerous times after finally transferring the gift to Catelyn... I think this might be necessary because if you think about it, he was the intermediary between the black brothers and the wildlings. Without him, the metaphorical shit will hit the fan, and chaos will destroy the Night's Watch and people will simply start fleeing South. The Wall would fall, as it is only as strong as the people who hold it... 

Scenario 2: Jon stays dead. Without strong leadership, the Night's Watch will  fall apart and with all the wildlings present anarchy would follow. The Wall falls and the Others start their march South. All of Westeros is in peril etc etc... 

Scenario 3: Jon stays dead and is put in one of the ice cells but comes back to life as a wight. Not very likely, but still I have a feeling those ice cells will play a role later on in the books.

Scenario 4: Jon continues to live as a warg inside Ghost and later maybe others. Maybe he flees towards Bran? Who knows

[Speculation](/g ""So, after finishing ADWD, I started wondering what could happen to The Night's Watch now that Jon Snow is presumably dead. I have come up with a few scenario's that seem likely to me:

Scenario 1: Jon Snow is revived by Melisandre, her being a red priestress, and I'm geussing she has this power as well as the red priest of Beric Dondarrion. This would lead to more tension and power play between the black brothers but somehow probably maintaining order. This is not entirely unlikely, as Beric Dondarrion has been brought back from the dead numerous times after finally transferring the gift to Catelyn... I think this might be necessary because if you think about it, he was the intermediary between the black brothers and the wildlings. Without him, the metaphorical shit will hit the fan, and chaos will destroy the Night's Watch and people will simply start fleeing South. The Wall would fall, as it is only as strong as the people who hold it...

Scenario 2: Jon stays dead. Without strong leadership, the Night's Watch will fall apart and with all the wildlings present anarchy would almost inevitably follow. The Wall falls and the Others start their march South. All of Westeros is in peril etc etc...

Scenario 3: Jon stays dead and is put in one of the ice cells but comes back to life as a wight. Not very likely I know, but nonetheless I have a feeling those ice cells will play a role later on in the books...

Scenario 4: Jon continues to live as a warg inside Ghost and later maybe others. Maybe he flees towards Bran? Who knows...

I just think it was overall slow and uneventful. For me it gave me a feeling that the author was really dragging out on events that didn't really call for it. A big difference from the first three books if you ask me.

I would like to know if I'm just too inexperienced with reading George Martin to appreciate his literary presentation or do most of you agree that A Feast for Crows was not up to par with the first three books?

Is A Dance with Dragons better in this aspect? Does it resemble the first three books or is it more like A Feast of Crows in terms of plot development etc?

I just got past that part in SoS and when I finished the chapter I had to stop reading and walk around for a while. Robb and Catelyn were dead along with most of the other northernmen. As far as Arya knows, her whole family is dead. Why would she want to do anything of note? But it in no way turned me off to the story; it just made me want to keep reading. A whole host of main characters had been killed off. Like if Tolkein had killed Frodo and Aragorn or Rowling killed Snape way earlier. Had that happened I would have not wanted to keep reading. It would have probably been a chore. But there is so much going on in this series and Martin so expertly weaves these story lines together that I just want to know how it is going to affect everything else. I learned early on not to get attached to a character so I am kind of scared for Arya and Tyrion but  valar morghulis.

1941,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-8-26,2012,8,26,12,yu7bu,self.gameofthrones,Why did the Valyrian Freehold never expand to the mainland of Westeros?  (Spoiler ADWD),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/yu7bu/why_did_the_valyrian_freehold_never_expand_to_the/,Pepzoid,1345953019,"In Dance, Tyrion remarks that ""The Freehold's grasp had reached as far as Dragonstone, but never to the mainland of Westeros itself,"" even though all the real wealth and value lay further west and they had dragons.  Considering that the Targaryens managed to conquer all of Westeros with a ""measly"" 3 dragons, the Freehold as a whole would have had zero trouble.

My question is this: why did a massive quasi-empire halt their expansion at Dragonstone?  Their conquest of such a large portion of Essos to gather slaves for their mines clearly shows their desire to hoard gold, yet they don't even touch the mines in the Westerlands (which they must have known existed).  So what is the real barrier preventing their natural growth west?

My theory is that the Valyrians of old knew of both the White Walkers and the threat they posed, possibly with the aid of glass candles.  Deciding that expanding into such a threatened area was folly they chose instead to establish an impenetrable fortress on Dragonstone, sufficiently close to Westeros to monitor without being easily accessible by this barely understood foe.  With time this concept is lost and after the Doom there is nothing to prevent the Targaryens from conquering what had previously been almost taboo.

Some holes I can find in my own theory:  I'm a little iffy on the timeline but Children of the Forest had been giving the Night's Watch obsidian daggers (presumably to combat the Others) for thousands of years before The Conquest.  Dragonstone has massive deposits of Obsidian, and the Valyrians had their eponymous steel as well as their formidable dragons.  From what I know of them they were a proud and haughty people and nothing would lead me to believe that they would actually fear a threat they had the tools to combat.  (Maybe that is a testament to the actual threat that the Others pose.)  Another timeline concern is that, according to ""A Wiki of Ice and Fire"", the Targaryens only built Dragonstone a century or so before the Doom (and invaded a century after that).  I'm undecided if two centuries to plan the conquest of an entire conquest is sufficient time or if it is understandable they would be stalled.  Tyrion seems to think they had time to do more (and Tyrion is not one to be argued with).  Hell, Baratheons had no dragons and managed to overthrow the status quo in two years.  Additionally, the Targaryens conquered the entire continent (minus Dorne) with 3 dragons and fewer than 1600 men.  With a larger initial force (say, the might of a larger portion of the Freehold) their casualties would have been minimal and easily worth even a year or two of dominance of Westeros.

So now that the good ole block'o'text is out of the way I'd like to hear opinions from anyone who would care to share.

Years ago, his great-great grandfather, along with his great grandfather, and his grandfather, as well as his own father, had done the same.  Hundreds and thousands of steps, all leading up and down in a twisted maze of cruelty and perversion.  *Up and down.  Right and wrong.  Life...and death?*  The Game of Thrones.

He pondered the stairs for eight hours, his eyes fixated on their plain, yet strangely elegant, array.  Others passed by, staring at him like he was an idiot.  One had even bothered to say ""Are you feeling alright, m'lord?""  *The nerve of these cravens.*

""I'm fine.""  *No, I'm actually not fine.*

The door to the palace was just a door, yet it had to be tirelessly explained.  The doorknob was golden, unearthed perhaps from the golden hills of Goldenland?  Or maybe it was from Goldenburg, where the rock there was said to be made from gold.  Above it was the silver-haired kitty, the banner of Lord Pussywillow.  It was tripping a scrawny-looking turnip farmer, who gets continuously annoyed with the cat's intrusive behavior.  It was said the Pussywillows worked endlessly to annoy their foes, scattering marbles across the dirt roads and leaving loose boards lying around.  Eventually their foes would curse themselves silly and retreat to get bandaids.

""Uh, would you like to come in, ser?""

A weasely-looking bald man of four-and-twenty was glaring at him.  The man was homely, not comely, yet plain and square of face, with a wispy blonde yet brown beard that may or may not have been hiding a receding chin.  His eyes were gaunt and hollow, yet piercing and foreboding.  He could have been barely over five feet, or six and a half feet long depending on how you looked at him.  He was also missing an ear.

""I must needs consults the counsel,"" he replied.

The homely man arched his eyebrow.  ""Uh, you wanna talk to Lord Pussywillow?""

*Does he mean to make a mummer's farce of this?  Perhaps a jape of some sort?*  ""I must needs conversate at once.  Must needs immediately!""

The indescribable man led him to the hall where Lord Pussywillow was seated.  Inside were lords and ladies and squires and servants and jesters and fiddlers and singers.  He recognized the banners of the Jeffersons, Griffiths, and the Cleavers.  To his left were the two houses of the Bradys, with Lord Petyr, Lord Greg, and Prince Bobby quarreling among each other.  Lady Marmalade was seated to his right,  her monstrous dugs spilling over the dais like a soft milky avalanche of rich creamy goodness.  

Something began to stir beneath his breeches.  It was his cock.  It yearned to bury itself henceforth into her frothing wet mound of a cunt.  Just one sweet taste of that hairy auburn mound which nestled itself deep within the recesses of her breaches.  He hadn't been with a prostitute since Tuesday, and all he could think of was filthy, dirty poontang.  She was probably twelve years old.

""Ah, yes, greetings Ser Thomys"" smiled Lord Pussywillow, grease dripping down his chin for no apparent reason.

""Good tidings, Lord Pussy"" Thomys replied.  *Actually bad morrow, you old fucking fool.*

""We must needs talk of many things,"" Pussywillow said.  ""But first, we will have a little snack.""

Dinner was small and plain, unbefit for a king.  Honey-roasted stuffed capons were brought out, along with stuffed geese, stuffed doves, roasted lamb and pheasant, bacon-wrapped horse souffle, an entire roasted boar with onion garlic ranch dipping sauce, clams, oysters in the shell, cockles, sea bass and grilled trout, barbecued venison, beer-battered honey-barbecue wings, baby-back ribs, a blooming onion, lamprey pies, meat pies, chili pies, seafood pies, shepherd's pie, pie pie, and 4x4s animal style with extra cheese.

Thomys nibbled on a ham sandwich and sent the rest away.

Dessert was another sad affair.  Lemon tarts, blueberry tarts, raspberry tarts, blackberry tarts, boysenberry tarts, strawberry tarts, sweet tarts, and ho-hos for Lady Pillowcheeks, Pussywillow's enourmous half-retarded bastard girl.

Thomys gazed at those around him.  Great Lord-Drinks-A-Fuckton was knee deep in summerwine, boasting of the time he beat the water level in Battletoads.  Elsewhere the squires were playing a game whose-in-my-mouth, until one of them lost a finger.  The lad was so drunk, he was laughing the entire time.  Old Maester Cockburns was going around adding milk-of-the-poppy to any cup he could find for whatever  reason.  The singer, Ser Toolivecrew, was serenading maidens with bawdy tunes from his days as a young lad:

""You see, me and my homies like to play this game 

We call it Amtrak but some call it the train 

We all would line up in a single-file line 

And take our turns at waxing girls' behinds 

But every time it came to me, I was shit out of luck 

Because I'd stick my dick in, and it would get stuck.""

The maidens were blushing and Thomys felt the need to retch.  He threw up on one of the serving girls, who seemed to pay no mind.

""That's alright, m'lord, we pretty much get the shit-end of a stick in this series, anyway.""

She left to deliver a bastard boy.  Thomys was growing tired of hospitality.  *I grow tired of hospitality.*

""Lord Pussywillow, I believe it is time for business.""

Pussywillow stirred in his seat, grease still dripping down his chin.  ""Yes, well, let's not a make a mummer's farce of it.  What is it you've come here for, my boy?""

""I've come ask you for more turnips--""

Just then, Pussywillow's guards seized Thomys and shoved him to the ground.

""My seven gods, or old gods, or the bright and dark ones, what are you doing,"" he managed to squeak out.

""Fuck you,"" declared Pussywillow, as the blades went down Thomys's neck.

As the darkness began to take him, he remembered one moment in his life.  One moment which seemed to stick out above the rest, and would be repeated for at least 700 pages.  

*Lady Marmalade had such huge tits.  I mean, were they even natural?  I could motorboat those titties for hours.*

As the darkness closed, he imagined himself drowning in a sea of titties.  

*And Moon Boy, for all I know...*

Anyway, played a game today with my buddies. There were only 4 of us, so we played with the recommended houses for 4 people, Stark, Baratheon, Tyrell, and Lanister. No doubt we were a little clumsy with the ruels because it was our first game, but I noticed some things, and I was wondering what other people who have played the game thought.

1. Seems like the 4 player rules recommend poor choices for the houses. While it makes sense from a storyline sense, I think in terms of game play it would be better to play with Martell instead of Lannister. That way the board is more spread out. As it was, myself (Baratheon), and Tyrell just kind of split up Dorne and the marches without ever having conflict, while Stark and Lannister beat eachother up around the neck.

2. Is Stark at a disadvantage? My buddy who played stark made a LOT of really, really stupid decisions, but he claims stark is at a disadvantage because of the supply deficit they start with. Thoughts? I actually like the Stark start, and think they Greyjoys probably have the worst start.

3. Is there some way to add benefit to not being last on the Fiefdoms influence track? There's no real reason to bid anything on it unless you plan to win it... But we also didn't use the optional rules, are they any good?

4. Need. More. Supply.

I think Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaeryen, and Lyana Stark. Let me explain how I have come to this conclusion.


Let's go back to before the war against the Mad King Aerys. I forget which tournament it was specifically, but when Rhaegar won, he gave the 'beauty' prize (?) to Lyana, instead of his wife to everyones surprise. This to me lays some ground work that at least Rhaegar had feelings for Lyana. 


Now, I forget if Robert was specifically betrothed to Lyana, or if that was going to be the plan, or whatever. In the first book Robert speaks very harshly of Rhaegar, and says he kidnapped Lyana. I feel this is false. I forget which book specifically, but people who knew Rhaegar well, described him as a very compassionate, gentle person. Rhaegar was also well loved by the smallfolk, and from what I gather, was a genuinely good person.


I believe that Lyana willingly ran away with Rhaegar. I remember Ned mentioning or maybe he had a memory of Lyana saying that Robert would never be faithful to her. They never explain the exact circumstances around her disappearance, unless I missed something.


Now, we know Lyana's disappearance/kidnapping was at the very least a catalyst that started the war against the Mad King. Lets think about the time it could take, for Ned and Robert's armies to not only fight their way to King's Landing, but to Lyana. A war in this type of setting could easily turn into 9-12 month process, and longer with sieges. 


In the first book AGOT, Ned has a flashback to the encounter with the Kingsguard of the time at the (I forget the name) tower. The flashback doesn't explain a lot of things, and at the end of it, it describes Ned holding Lyana as she lies dieing in a pool of blood, making an as yet still unknown promise to her. 


Now, the Mad King's Kingsguard have all been described as some of the most honorable/skilled men of their time. And we already know that Rhaegar has feelings for Lyana from his actions after winning the tournament, so why would he attempt to kill her? And obviously he had also died fighting Robert at the Triedent prior to Ned's encounter with the Kingsguard. On that note as well, why would he order his kingsguard to kill her? And would they have actually followed that order if he had given it?


Now, with all that explained, I believe that Lyana died giving birth to Rhaegar's son, while making Ned promise to keep the secret of his lineage from Robert especially due to a distinct challenge to his claim of the throne. We know he wanted to have Danaerys killed during AGOT for the same thing.

Cary's and Littlefinger talk to her about the dagger that was used to kill Bran, and I found a bit of an inconsistency in Littlefinger's story that would have made me question the truth of it. (I don't know if this has been pointed out before, so I apologize if it has..)

When Littlefinger tells Catelyn that the dagger was his, before losing it to Tyrion Lannister, he says that he lost it to Tyrion because they bet on the joust between Jamie Lannister and Loras Tyrell. What makes it unbelievable to me is that Tyrion would bet against his own brother that he looks up to. 

Some evidence that backs up this claim can be found during the hand's tourney. Renly Baratheon bets on Sandor Clegane to beat Jamie Lannister, and he comments that he wished the Imp were at the tournament, so he could have earned double for betting against Jamie. So I'm wondering, why did no one see this inconsistency?

The specifics escape me, but due to his fever he is frequently given dreamwine and has fever dreams that bring him back to, primarily, the events of Aerys' death. He has one dream where he's in the dungeons of Casterly Rock with Brienne and Ned Stark appears, as well as Arthur Dayne and Rhaegar and other Brothers of the Kingsguard.

My question is: despite the fact that these dreams aren't a major influence on the plot, do you think we'll see them in the 3rd season? How might they be filmed or portrayed?

I ask because I think these dreams were really good character development for Jaime. To me they are the epitome of his character becoming more appealing and likeable. Especially after losing his hand, he becomes a bit more humble and willing to share his fears and shortcomings -- at least with the reader -- which culminate in these dreams. We also learn that there was more to killing Aerys than we might have thought -- the fact that the king wanted to burn King's Landing, and we also learn the specifics of Rickard and Brandon Starks' deaths in the Red Keep. 

Also, these scenes could be a good excuse for Sean Bean to come back and film an unannounced cameo as Ned Stark. Jaime often recalls sitting the Iron Throne after killing Aerys, and meeting Ned Stark's cold, judgmental eyes after the latter's arrival. I think this is an important image that needs to be filmed as a flashback or dream, especially since the reader just learned that Jaime had slightly more justification for killing Aerys, while he continues to receive flak and judgement for killing the man he was sworn to protect. I understand the producers might be hesitant to portray characters like Arthur Dayne or Rhaegar, who have been mentioned in the show but have not appeared -- so they could simplify it. I think most people are open to Ned appearing again briefly, as long as it's tastefully done in a flashback or dream and not *overdone*.",36,26,False,self,,,,,

A few weeks ago I came across the [Magic Set Editor](http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/) which inspired me to create my own set of cards based on the ASOIAF universe. I have seen a couple [other attempts at this online](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?p=8405848), but none have gone to the lengths of preparing complete, constructed decks. 

My understanding of the Magic meta-game is rudimentary at best, so these decks may not be as focused as they should be. I chose spells and character abilities that matched the flavor of the story more than established deck archetypes. Please note, *they are balanced against each other,* they are not made to be balanced in standard play. I have been playing these decks against each other using modified commander rules, and they are a blast. Keep in mind that these are rough drafts, and I plan on continuing to tweak them as they are playtested. Many of the creatures are defensively oriented, so stalemates are common until one player can leverage an advantage to gain the critical upper hand. This leads to epic, drawn-out games with lots of tactical options.

~~In order to avoid a slideshow of considerable length, I am going to post one deck now, and provide links to others in the comments. If enough people show interest, I can upload the deck files for others to tinker with.~~ I welcome suggestions for balance and additional cards or mechanics. I am only halfway done with ACoK, but I did a lot of reading on the [ASOIAF wikia](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/) while researching this project, so the cards include some things from later books. I have tried to keep spoilers out of the cards for the most part, but one might be able to deduce things on context. Consider yourself warned of potential spoilers.

I would like to (at least try to) give credit where it is due and acknowledge that much of the card art is lifted from [Final Flight Games' card game](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=10&amp;efcid=4). Other art was grabbed from various DeviantArt and Tumblr accounts and a dozen other sources. I made no attempt to keep track of sources, and in many cases I cropped credits out (dick move, I know, but I was concerned with aesthetics). If you see one of your pieces here, know that you have my thanks for inspiring this project and that your work is not being used for profit.

**TL;DR: [Here is the Lannister deck.](http://imgur.com/a/HMCR2#48)**

**[Here is the Stark deck.](http://imgur.com/a/djltZ#11)**

**Edit: Here are the SPOILERISH [Daenerys](http://imgur.com/a/B3iQb#11) and [Nightwatch](http://imgur.com/a/hoiTi#21) decks, but they are a deal more unfinished and are not at all playtested yet.**

* The characters travel a lot, and unless I use the maps provided in the book, I'm often lost.
* There are a lot of flashbacks and tales from the past. (Especially in AFFC)
* Most decisions are justified through internal narration. We know why Tyrion choses an answer rather than another.

In the show, these things aren't very well transcripted.

* In Season 2, the whole war between the Lannisters and the Stark is extremely confusing. We don't know who is where ? What is the point of their decision ? We don't know what the world look like. We don't understand why a decision was a good move, an ambush, a flanking, etc. Also, we don't get a very good idea of how big the world is.
* Flashbacks/dreams are hard to do in TV shows. You have to hire younger version actors of the main protagonists. (Which cost a lot) and the director always feels obliged to apply a lame photoshop filter on the screen to make you understand that ""It's a dream/flashback"". That's why we don't know much about the past in the show.
* The books is centered around character POV. The show is more centered around geographical point of views. We don't know what the characters are thinking, unless they confess their plans to another character. This is the currently applied technique in the show, but it kills a lot of character's credibility. For example, when Littlefinger boast about ""Knowledge is power"" and then get threatened by Cersei. Petyr Baelish would NEVER do something that stupid. He would keep his thought to himself. However, I think the cunning plan with wich Tyrion trapped Pycelle in season 2 was very well directed. 

Here are a bunch of ideas I'd like to see :

* Using the 3D map from the show opening, I wouldn't mind seeing the good old [""Indiana Jones style""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tp-N8j6oSE) travel routes. Also, to get a good idea of the time that goes by, a few indicators such as ""Meanwhile"", or ""Three weeks later"" when changing POV would be welcome. I'd also would mind if war strategy discussion were make around a map and if we saw hands moving chess-pieces on the map while explaining what they intend to do. 
* Using the appropriate artstyle, I think GoT could pull off the story-telling animations we saw in [Harry Potter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdSpZgE3fD4&amp;feature=related) and Hellboy 2 prologue. It's computer generated but much cheaper than regular CGI because you don't have to make it look ""realistic"". It's also something that could be ""out of the regular show"". Only on the internet, a fan-made contest, but still sponsored by HBO. 
* This is a problem that has been relatively handled correctly up until now. However, I don't know how they will pull off a certain monologue in the beginning of [AFFC](/b ""Jaime's monologue when he guards his father's corpse"") and most characters internal thoughts when scheming.

It's been a long, long time coming, but I've finally found the drive to finish up the family tree connecting all the families of Westeros. A super thank you to /u/PrivateMajor and /u/Thurinus for helping me with getting all the data for this. We started this project around June 14th and lost interest a couple times, but I finally set out to finish adding the smaller houses yesterday.

Without further delay, you can see the finished product [here](http://minus.com/lJCtWxg4efSLs) as a 21166x3838 gif.

A few things about it: I can't get it to generate ""properly,"" so when you see numbers on someone's name, that means it is referring to something else. In addition, those random unknown unknowns at the bottom. Finally, some of the marriage and sibling links don't show up, so if you are really into that, I'd recommend getting another format.

**Formats**

I've uploaded all the relevant files to Mediafire [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?bb23m94jvfufh).

The GED file can be opened with any genealogy program, I used Gramps for the data entry and Family Tree Maker 2012 for the exporting.

ASOIAFprintable.pdf is a pdf file with all of it on 105 pages, just in case you have a lot of money to blow on ink and paper. 

Finally, anything called ASOIAFwhole is like [this](http://minus.com/lJCtWxg4efSLs), but in case you prefer another format I threw them up there. ",4,32,False,self,,,,,

Season 3 will end with the most famous scene from SoS (or episode 9). Season 4 will be the remainder of SoS and maybe a brief intro to AFFC/ADWD. Those two books will be combined and span 3 seasons (I've heard that mentioned but not sure if that was something the creators suggested or just fan speculation.)

So by the end of  the current books, we have 7 seasons. Season 8 would be in 2018, and hopefully TWoW/ADoS is released by then... And assumes there aren't any more books!

That's at least 9 seasons of TV. It's really rare for a show to last that long, especially one with a high budget. How many seasons have some of the more successful HBO shows had? Will seasons 5-6 move too slowly for the majority of the non-reader audience, leading to reduced viewers and a cancellation?

You also have the aging of some of the younger actors to deal with. It could cause some issues. And people getting other jobs. Secondary characters aren't only living off their handful of episodes a year. Would we see lots of replacements?

Would season 4 be a good place to end the TV series if they think it can't make it to the end? 

What if ADoS isn't ready by 2018 and the show is still on the air? Do Dave and Dan take GRRM's notes and make it, essentially spoiling the book?

(A lot of Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/z14v1/list_of_deviations_between_books_and_the_show_a/,LegendaryMouse,1346263660,"Hi all. Nearly done with A Dance with Dragons here. I got excited and wanted to watch the series again, and on my second time through I noticed some apparently heavy deviations from the books. Truth be told,  I noticed them the first time through, but I chose to ignore them for the sake of the show. Heres the list of deviations that I noticed. Feel free to add more if I have left some out.

* Who the hell is Talisa? And where the hell is she in the books? Clearly she is replacing Jeyne Westerling's role, but I don't understand why. I've done a ton of google searches about this but to no avail.

* Nearly every scene of Daenerys in Qarth. Now, it's been a while since I read A Clash of Kings, but the show seems fairly on track until Pyat Pree kills the Thirteen. What just happened? In fact, I don't even remember her dragons being stolen while she was in Qarth, because she walked into the House of the Undying carrying Drogon. Pyat Pree doesn't die either.

* There is also the matter of Xaro Xhoan Daxos. I don't ever remember reading that Daenerys locked him away in his empty vault. He tried to woo her, but never betrayed her.

* Why are they calling Asha Greyjoy Yara? I read somewhere that it was to avoid confusion with Osha, but come on. We aren't that stupid.

* In the novel, Arya is never Tywin Lannister's cupbearer. She is instead the cupbearer for Roose Bolton.

* I also felt that the relationship between Qhorin Halfhand and Jon Snow was poorly developed. In the books, Jon and Qhorin separate from the group to scout ahead and end up fleeing to a cave. When they exit, they are captured by the wildlings and Jon has to kill Qhorin to prove he can be a wildling. If the cave scene happened, it would have given viewers the chance to see that Qhorin told Jon to kill him if the time came. (Technically he says it in the show, but it's easy to miss.)

* Arya kills the Tickler herself, she doesn't get Jaqen H'ghar to do it. She also doesn't get him to kill Amory Lorch either. Her second name is actually a man named Weese. Amory Lorch dies from Vargo Hoat, whohas a seemingly nonexistent role in the second season.

* Irri does not die in Qarth. She is still alive in A Dance with Dragons. I just read about her.

* Doreah should never be alive to betray Daenerys. She died in the Red Waste.

* During the Battle of the Blackwater, Sansa refuses to leave with the Hound. In the show, she says it's because her place is here, and Stannis won't hurt her anyway. In the book, it's because she was secretly awaiting an escape plan from Ser Dontos.

* Sadly, in the book, there was no single, exploding, kamikaze ship in the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion actually made a giant chain in the bay that was raised to trap Stannis's fleet while they threw wildfire from the castle. In my opinion though, I think the exploding ship was cooler :P

I guess I can understand some slight deviation from the books. After all, they are changing from one medium to another, but damn...some of these are just ridiculous. They had some great material to work with so I don't understand why they feel like they could do a better job by making something up. Closure for the season, perhaps. Regardless, it's still one of the best shows on television. :)",52,10,False,self,,,,,

There has to be some truth to it because he knows that it was Mance who infiltrated Winterfell, but in his letter, he also asked for his bride (Jeyne Poole pretending to be Arya) and Reek (Theon) meaning he doesn't have them. in the final Asha chapter, we see Asha and Theon Reunited at Stannis' camp along with Jeyne by the Braavosi banker. So if Ramsay had indeed defeated and killed Stannis, wouldn't he have captured Theon and Jeyne as well?

Unless Theon and Jeyne left Stannis before the supposed battle (unlikely since they weren't in great condition when last we saw them), the fact that Ramsay is demanding Theon and Jeyne's return means he's probably bullshitting about Stannis being dead. Once he found out Mance had been sent by Jon, he must have naturally assumed than Theon and Jeyne had escaped to the Wall, which is why he told Jon to return them. Tell me if this makes sense.

I know it gets a lot of criticism as the weakest book of the series thus far, and to be honest I'm finding it hard to disagree. 

But before I cast judgement on it I wanted to have a brief discussion with you lot about your feelings on the book. Certainly, having just finished it my mind is clouded by the string of events that happen in the last hundred pages or so. The way it ramps up to an exciting climax is something it has in common with ASOS, but it has also muddied the waters of my opinion.

Is it a bad book? Probably not. Is it worse than ASOS? Definitely, but then ASOS is (for me) one of the greatest works of fantasy literature every written. What did you guys think? How many of you had no problems with the book *per se* but were just disappointed with the lack of Tyrion, Jon, Dany, Davos etc?
