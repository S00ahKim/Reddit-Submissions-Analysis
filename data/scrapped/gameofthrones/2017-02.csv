This led the White Walkers to them and broke the warding/spells that had prevented their entry. It was a tragic and terrifying episode that cost the lives of the Three-Eyed Raven, Hodor, and Summer. Meera and Bran were on the run, pursued by the wights and were saved by Coldhands/Benjen. Benjen is now half white walker and is unable to cross the wall but he delivers Bran and Meera to the wall so they can pass through to safety. I know it has already been discussed that Bran crossing the wall with the mark from the Night King could potentially break the warding/spells that prevent the White Walkers from crossing the wall. My theory is that the Night King did not intend to kill Bran but rather herd him toward the wall and hasten his crossing. Benjen, as a half walker, could be a double agent and supporting this effort. With Bran being paralyzed and Hodor and Summer dead, this leaves only Meera to drag him all the way back to the wall. Having Benjen, an assumed trusted friend and relative, carry them on horseback and urge Bran to get south of the wall, this ensures that Bran survives the trip back to the wall and is there quickly. With the wights in pursuit, there is a sense of fear and urgency to get to safety that may prevent him from considering the risks of breaking the spells.  As we've seen, the Night King has a telepathic control or hive-mind type of thing going on with the wights. It's unclear if he has control over the other White Walkers but if he does, he could be controlling Benjen to betray Bran. ",43,55,False,self,,,,,

Later, in Season 6, Cerci confesses that she killed Robert because it felt good.

If she arranged his murder, how?

Best justification I can come up with is she had Lancel stay close to Robert with plenty of wine hoping he would get too drunk and make a mistake.

If so, that is the weakest murder plot ever given that Robert was a known drunk and it isn't a stretch to think he was drunk on every hunt since he became King. Additionally, boar attacks are rarely fatal (~ 4 people killed annually by wild boar.. for comparison, ~22 people are killed annually by cows).

If this was the murder plan, it ranks right up there with getting him drunk and hoping he falls off his horse and dies.",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I posted this in another sub but i think it belongs here
But i still believe he is. Here is why and i will place popular arguments against it vs my own.

During season 1, ned reads the baratheon history that they all have black hair until he gets to little geoffry. Unless im missing something, lyanna has brown hair during the flashback of bran and the 3 eyed raven. Jon would have a low chance of being raven haired if rhaegar has silver hair and lyanna had brown hair. Now lets consider the texture. Lyanna and rhaegar both seem to have straight hair...while jon has curly or wavy black hair like.....guess who.

Now a popular argument against my claim is that rhaegar kidnapped lyanna before robert could wed her. Therefore they did not consummate the marriage. However if you subscribe to the theory that she went with rhaegar willingly....something pops up in my mind .

During one of the early episodes, cersei claims that robert was always profusely drunk when he get into her bed. She would finish him off in other ways. He was drunk enough to not ever question that he never um....got in there and hit the target. So we know from the show that robert had a history of getting black out drunk and not remembering having relations with his wife.

There is a possibility i think that robert may have inadvertently raped lyanna during a drunken stupor. If we know he doesnt remember not finishing in cersei, there is no reason to beleive he would remember raping lyanna.

This is when the kidnapping comes into play. Lyanna went with rhaegar because she was afraid of being raped by robert again. She was pregnant already when she went with him.

As far as lyanna telling ned to not tell robert...i have a theory. One is that she doesnt think robert will remember raping her and that he will think she is lying to protect what he thinks would be rhaegars son.

Robert is notoriously butthurt over lyanna leaving with rhaegar. He is also notoriously stubborn. Even if lyanna told ned it was roberts baby...robert probably wouldnt believe her, and would have killed him over the false pretense that it was the result of rhaegar assaulting her.

Sorry for the spellings. Im on my phone.

I want to believe.

Many fans used this as subtle evidence Jon is Targaryen (R+L=J confirmed). Theories about Joramun's Horn and Jojen Paste seem to be based on small but not insignificant lines from characters like Bloodraven and Bran. 
This line of theorising is probably more popular among book readers as they tend to get a lot more hints from GRRM than show watchers get from D&amp;D. But my question doesn't involve only one or the other.
In literature, there are two narrative devices GRRM seems to like using. 1) The shaggydog story. This is where a characters story ends up falling flat on its head, often deliberately, a wild goose chase to throw readers/viewers off the trail. GRRM/D&amp;D don't use this a lot, but do use it well. For instance, Rickon's story in the show, is very much a shaggydog story, leading nowhere and not really progressing the plot. Fitting that his direwolf is called 'Shaggydog' is suppose. 2) Chekhov's gun. Famous playwright Anton Chekhov is often quoted to have said ""Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there."" This, I believe, is one of GRRM's key methods for writing, and it works so well. Small lines or references often foreshadow major events to come. Like how often Cersei talks of burning cities to the ground, and how the wildfire caches under King's Landing are frequently mentioned coming up to the trial. And you don't talk about wildfire and not have it go off. 
Anyway, long tangent, here's my question: What lines and small references do you believe may become important as the story continues? And what possible instances of Chekhov's Gun may be a shaggydog story, and vice versa. 
I know this was long and took awhile to get to the point, but I'm really interested in what people think. Thanks!",10,5,False,self,,,,,

This will perfectly match her prophecy in the House of the Undying. Remember, she is in the (destroyed, snowy) throne room, but right before she touches the throne, she goes north of the Wall. She is then reunited with Khal Drogo (in the afterlife).

I am completely in the dark so do not spoil anything. Also i will mainly focus on four stories House Stark, House Targaryen, House Lannister, and House Baratheon. Now let's begin:

House Baratheon: I think Stannis will be revealed to be still alive and in hiding in the Vale as Brienne spared his life. After hearing Jon has retaken Winterfell and the starks are reborn he decides it is now time to do the same so he makes his way to KL to find Gendry where he believes he is at. He gets there but he does not find him but a mysterious Priest (played by Jim Broadbent) says he is taking a ship to Dorne and he has heard of a blacksmith in Dorne with the same description so he goes with him to Dorne. Stannis finds out that Gendry was found by Oberyn and Oberyn gave Gendry a ship to Dorne where he would be much safer and Gendry has been there ever sense as a blacksmith.

Stannis informs him he needs his help bringing back House Baratheon. Gendry refuses at first but then Stannis stats he is sorry for what he had done Gendry accepts his apology and they along with Jim Broadbent's character go to get House Dayne to swear to there allegiance as Gendry is friends with one of the knights there. They get to starfall where they meet Sir Gerold Dayne and The shows version of Arianne Martell Arianne Dayne. Gerold who is friends with Gendry swears Allegiance to House Baratheon. Stannis, Gendry, Gerold, Arianne, and Jim Broadbent's character make there way to the storms end to try and get the houses there to swear allegiance to House Baratheon they only get small houses. However they are bale to get House Connington to swear allegiance to House Baratheon. Also when they get to Dragonstone they find some of the soldiers that left Stannis when they whined to attack Bolton controlled Winterfell and some that stayed at Dragonstone all together. So now Stannis and Gendry march with there armies made up of House Dayne, House Connington, Some smaller houses, and The remaining Soldiers of Stannis to KL to retake for House Baratheon as the starks did for Winterfell. (but more on this in House Targaryen's story)

House Stark: In Winterfell Brienne and Podrick have returned from The Riverlands and inform Sansa they have failed. Sansa and Jon also get into a small conflict but it is quickly resolved as they must remember what is coming. Bran returns to Winterfell with Meera and Bran informs Jon of his true parentage buy showing him a vision of the marriage between Lyanna and Rhaegar and also his birth. After this Jon gets a Raven from Dany asking for his help in taking KL Jon answers the call and he with Davos, Ghost, and the Northern army march to KL to meet with Daenerys.

On there way there they run into the BWB and the hound who decide to tag along. They also retake Riverrun for House Tully and also run into Arya. Jon and Arya have a reunion and she tags along as well. When they get to storm lands they take a ship to the Reach where Daenerys is. Jon makes it with his armies and also Davos, Ghost, the BWB, the Hound, and Arya to meet with Daenerys. Meanwhile Sansa and Bran have to deal with the Umbers and the Karstarks who have raised an army to take WF in the name of the dead Ramsay and Roose Bolton. Bran sees this and warns Sansa. It is also revealed Littlefinger betrayed Ned and Sansa has Littlefinger killed for this. Anyways Sansa goes to negotiate with Alys Karstark and the Sister of Smalljon Umber. She negotiates and The Umber sister is executed ending the Umber bloodline but Alys is spared and is now sworn to House Stark.

House Targaryen: Daenerys with the Tyrell fleet land in the Reach wall the Pro Dany house greyjoy fleet and the Martell fleet fight off Euron's fleet. Euron kills all three of the sand snake leaving Ellaria and take Yara hostage destroying most of the house Martell fleet. The remaining House Martell fleet returns to Dorne wall the House Greyjoy fleet goes to Dragonstone to take it for Daenerys. Jon explains to Daenerys he is his nephew and there is a bigger threat coming The White Walkers. Dany and her fleet with the Greyjoy fleet, the Tyrell fleet, whatever is left of the Martell fleet, and The Northern fleet regroup at KL to prepare the siege.

House Lannister: Cersei goes much more mad with the death of her son and the people turning against her even Jaime no longer loves her. Euron comes with Yara as his hostage and swears allegiance with Cersei. They also marry also Mel arrives at KL and Randall and Dickon Tarly and Alys Karstark (secretly) to swear allegiance to house Lannister. However on the night of Euron and Cersei's wedding Euron pulls a red wedding and kills everyone who attended Yara, Bronn, Illyn Payne, The Brave Companions, Melisandre, Alys Karstark, Walder Frey's remaining sons, Randall and Dickon tarly, and also Jaime kills Cersei then Euron kills Jaime. Qyburn and the Mountain escape though and go into hiding in the streets of KL as Euron takes the iron throne. 

Epilogue: The battle begins and is brutal. Davos and Beric are killed by the Mountain, The Hound kills the Mountain, Missendei is killed by Euron, Grey worm is brutally murdered by some House Greyjoy soldiers, Theon loses his hand, Euron loses his eye, House Baratheon army comes in and kills most of the Dothraki, Stannis is burned alive by one of Dany's dragons, Qyburn is killed by Arya, and Euron uses his horn to take control Drogon. Dany is forced to kill Drogon and Euron falls from the sky and dies. But is found by a Red Priest (and yes he is resurrected). Dany then takes the iron throne but most of her allies (except for Jorah, Tyrion, Varys, and Olenna) are dead. Tyrion also poisons Elliaria for mrycella. Jon leaves her after seeing her dragons kills innocent people.

Jon, Gendry, Arya, Ghost, Thoros and the BWB, the Hound, and the northern soldiers leave to WF wall House Dayne and House Connington return to there respective homes. Arya and Gendry's wedding is held at WF and Jon decides not wanting anymore war goes to meet with the night king to make peace. Jon and The Night king talk and Night king commits suicide and plunges Jon's sword into his cold heart and all the Wights collapse and Jon is made the new night king. However Dany secretly with her two remaining dragons comes to winterfell and burns winterfell with Thoros, The BWB, the Hound, Bran, Meera, Lyanna Mormont, Ghost, Lord Manderly, Tormund, Robin Arryn, Jim Broadbent's character, Lord Glover, Lord Hornwood, and Podrick still inside but Sansa, Brienne, Gendry, and Arya escape a okay but Gendry and Sansa are caught by Dany's men and taken as Prisoners. With this Tyrion, Varys, and Theon change sides to House Stark and now Jon with his army made up of The Northern houses that still stand, The White walkers, The Knights of the Vale, Timett and the clansmen, The Wildlings, Edmure and his armies, The Ironborn, House Tyrell (who have also changed sides) march to fight against Dany and her dragons with her armies made up of the Dothraki, The Unsullied, The Westerlands armies, House Martell (now led by another one of Oberyn's bastards), and House Dayne (who were forced to side with Dany). Wall Arya takes a ship to Storm lands to meet with Jon Connington to lead Gendry's Baratheon army against Dany. Not before going to the Riverlands where she finds Nymeria.

The season ends with a resurrected Euron being revealed to be Azor Ahai by sacrificing the red priest who saved him making Azor Ahai the bad guy and he meets with his second wave of Ironborn and his allies made up of the Second Sons, Sons of the Harpy, and Tyroshi forces lead by Daario.

When you combine what's left of the Masters, Euron, and most of all a spurned Daario (who would make a really amazing twist villain near the end of the season) and whatever is left in the Lannister army, Cersei actually starts to look a lot more formidable.

Not necessarily ""want"" but u will definitely hate it if it doesn't happen.

Mine are

1. Cersei dying. I don't know but after all the things she did all the way from S1, it's almost close to impossible to see her alive especially with Dany's army coming. We already have Arya and Jon and another character ""miraculously"" surviving against all adversity seems unGameofThrones for me.

2. Dany close to iron throne but not sitting on the chair. We've seen it from her visions in the house of undying and I think it just makes sense. Iron Throne may be her goal but it's not her end game. She may or may not die but she will definitely help Jon fight against WW. No question about it.

3. Arya not dying. Atleast for this season. If she does, her whole arc is waste. The producers spent a significant amount of screen time to feature her journey from Winterfell to Braavos and if it all end up her dying without doing something.. it's just a waste..

4. Gendry coming back and being a much more important character. He's the last Baratheon. Him, Jon, and Dany are the only 3 who has a claim to the throne. It's a shame if we don't see him come back. We've seen Benjen. Now it's time for our boy Gendry.

5. Sam using Heartsbane. Just like in the scene where Sam gave dragonglass to Jon before going Hardhome, Sam getting Heartsbane may be significant in his arc. Whether using it in fighting or Maesters inspecting it. Whatever it is, I'm excited.

""I knew you wanted me to bleed, obvious really"" 

And as the waif gets ready, she closes her eyes, the waif steps off quietly to slice her and *then* Ayra blows out the candle

Now these were less than a year old so the were probably around the time of season 5 or 6, but I don't get it. Don't get me wrong here, not everyone is going to like every character, and Jaime has most certainly done terrible things, but the reason he is one of my favorite characters is because his story is about redemption. He starts off as this arrogant murderer dickhead but later becomes this tragic character. The three points I see people bring up about hating him are him being in love with Cersei, him trying to kill Bran, and the sex scene in the Sept of Baelor. 


Now, I'm guessing the sex scene is still controversial with people, but there's a great page on the wiki explaining what happened: 

http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Jaime/Cersei_sex_scene_in_%22Breaker_of_Chains%22

Basically it was poor editing and camerawork, and the vague responses from the writers/ producers that made it seem as if though Jaime was raping Cersei. I haven't read the books, but my friend had and she pointed out to me that it was consensual in the books, and it simply doesn't make sense for Jaime to do something like that. He saved Brienne from being raped, which cost him his hand. So these things just don't add up, and the actors themselves said they never played it as a rape scene, nor were they instructed to. It seems this was a sensitive scene that wasn't handled well and wasn't re-edited as it should've been.


As for his attempted murder of Bran, I had it made clear to me by a quote I read by Martin (can't remember where, I'll try to find it) where essentially he says that Jaime was protecting his children, because if Robert had found out, then they would've been killed. Martin goes on to say that imagine it was your children, would you murder another child to save your own? It doesn't excuse what he did, but it sheds light on his motivations. 

Finally I would give him a pass for loving Cersei by quoting Jaime himself ""You don't choose who you love."" Plus with that look at the end of Winds of Winter, he might also become the Queenslayer. 


In short, why all the hate for Jaime? Am I alone in loving this character? 


TL;DR- Jaime's a cool guy, why don't people like him? ",56,29,False,self,,,,,

The blood trail ends at the fountain in the House of Black and White. The same fountain that Jaqen had her drink out of to restore her sight. When Jaqen begins walking down the stairs to the Hall of Faces we don't see any more blood. To me this means that Arya healed herself at the fountain.

It is a common theory already that Bran in one of his flashbacks is the cause of the mad kings madness and instilled the phrase ""Burn them all"" into his head. This would subsequently cause all of the events to follow. But the theories out there claim this would be a mistake made by Bran. But what if Bran instills this into the Mad Kings head on purpose? The key to killing white walkers is fire and what better form then wildfire? My theory is Bran meets up with his brother and whoever else has teamed up to beat the white walkers and they realize (through maybe Sam) the key to beating them is the abundant supply of wildfire under kings landing. This would be a last ditch effort to defeat the walkers as nothing else seems to be working and all hope seems to have been lost; they lure the walkers into kings landing and blow up the entire city. But in order to get the wildfire needed to save humanity Bran would have to go back and put whispers into the Kings head (Burn them all) that would result in him creating the supply of wildfire necessary. This would create a horrific chain of events but maybe it was all necessary to save humanity in the long run. With one big bang the walkers are gone simultaneously ending The Game of Thrones.",36,54,False,self,,,,,

I think it's interesting (especially knowing GRRM's opinions on prophecies in literature) that there are two main characters who can both see the future. However, from what we've been shown, the two methods are very different from each other:

- Bran can access his visions as long as he is at a weirwood tree
- Bran can channel his visions to show whatever / whenever he wants
- His visions have proven themselves to be a literal account of events

The same cannot be said of Danaerys:

- Her dragon dreams come randomly
- She has no control over what she sees
- Her dreams seem to be entirely metaphorical, opening the possibility for wrong interpretations

I believe there will come a crucial point where a decision must be made based on two opposing visions, or - at the very least - there will emerge some conflict between the two seers.

Jaime and Barriston seem to have a sort of unspoken respect for each other. Jaime tells Selmy the move he used was ""the best (he) had ever scene"" a compliment Jaime doesn't give out often, and Selmy talks highly of Jaime's skill as a young man. Throughout this scene the two seem to have a mutual respect for each other, something each rarely portray.

Later when Selmy is relieved of his role by Joffery, he implies Jaime is a bad choice for head of the kings guard because he betrayed Aerys II.


This is the only scene in the show where the two are together, I am curious if the book ever goes into depth about their relationship. As two of the best fighters and both being white cloaks it is safe to assume they interacted quite a bit. Are they friends? Does Selmy despise Jaime like everyone else or does he see more in him? Does Jaime look down on selmy or respect his honor/skill.",28,14,False,self,,,,,

(2nd Dance of Dragons),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5sc1o2/main_spoilers_theory_for_next_phase_of_the_war/,kipbutkiss,1486353964,"So at this point in the show Cersei holds The iron throne and is technically queen of Westeros due to a distant Baratheon claim.  However Daenerys is on her way acrossed The narrow sea with a huge army and already has the support of houses Tyrell and Martell giving her all of  there are forces. Also if she makes a marriage alliance with Jon Snow she will have the north and the vale too.(which Jon would most likely say yes to because her dragons can help defeat  the white walkers.) so pretty much the only opposition in the show is the Westerlands. Though there is one character that the show has left out that could change all of this. And because of this character it could explain why the next book is taking so long to finish. That person is Aegon the son of Rhaegar Who we thought died during the sack of Kings Landing. Now at this point in the books Aegon has so what control of the stormlands. Now let's say that the event at the grand Sept still happens and the alliance between house Tyrell and Lannister has dissolved. Willas being the eldest son would inherit highgarden. Now because Willis shared correspondence with Oberyn he would have no problem cohorting with the Martell's against the Lannister's. But in this situation Varys doesn't use his plot convenience teleportation to speak with the Tyrell's and the Martel's and instead they decide to bolster Aegon as their king. Aegon may have to marry one of the sand snakes to get Dorne on his side but they would join. Meanwhile Daenerys has made her way to Westeros and has liberated Pyke from Euron and then moves against the Lannister's. Lannisport shuts it's gates upon seeing the fleet and by doing this they have locked themselves in the hellfire that all three dragons will rain down and burn the city the ground . Afterwords the Kalasar swoops in and wipes out whoever's left making Cersei,Tyrion and Jaime the last possible Lannisters. This showsThe beginning of  Daenery's madness. Soon after the Rock surrenders. At some point either before or after she sends Tyrion to broker an alliance with Jon Snow. Whether John knows of her cruelty or not he is aware of the white walker threat and will agree to the alliance on the condition that she fight the white walkers upon their arrival.what follows is a bit unpredictable as I am unable to determine what the military actions of both sides will be I imagine the north will eventually push south and will go to the Riverlands and will probably give it back to the Tully's which will be interesting because Edmure's Child was in Lanisport so it's quite possible he may not bend the knee to her and she may kill him but that's a bit of a stretch.in the end though I feel that Daenery will make it to the  to the iron throne only have it Cut short because I believe that the entire city of Kings Landing will explode with not only her but Jon Snow the heads of all the major houses and most importantly her dragons. We would later find out that little finger was the one who set the explosives off so that he may be King by killing all the other claimants and still having the army of the vale behind him. Then the white walkers will then desend acrossed Westeros and destroy little fingers army and kill him as well and amidst the smoke arising from Kings Landing and the  salty tears from those who have survived Gendry will find Jon Snow's sword long claw amongst the rubble and then and only then the dragons will be awaken from the stone that was crushing them. And the last phase of the war will begin. The war for Dawn. If you made it this far let me know what you think about my theory in the comments and thank you for your time and sorry for the poor formatting.

Anyway, you can see the issue here. Tywin says the smallest were closer to the throne, but Viserys says they were at the doors, and they both saw the Iron Throne in the Red Keep at the same time period so the skulls wouldn't have been moved. 

We can't confide to the books because in the histories all we know is that 

&gt;  The skulls of the Targaryen dragons are stored in the cellars of the Red Keep.[1] Prior to Robert's Rebellion, House Targaryen decorated the walls of the throne room with the skulls of their dragons.

So Lyanna meets Rhaegar for the first time at the Tourney at Harrenhal during the year of the false spring. Not long after, she's ""kidnapped"" by Rhaegar. We also know that Robert was in love with her and they were to marry. But what if the reason Lyanna ran away with Rhaegar was Robert himself? Maybe Lyanna didn't like Robert? Or maybe they shared a night together and Robert forced himself on her and this pissed Lyanna off? She was 16 at the time and probably did not realise that her running away would lead to war? And who better to runaway with, than the crown prince? It makes sense from Lyanna's point of view.

It is both happy and sad (we know the ending will be 'bittersweet' so a song like this would fit tone wise,) I don't know exactly what it is but I just imagine this song playing when the credits roll for the very last episode of the series and it seems to hit me right emotionally. I know it sounds weird but I can't really describe it. It just feels - like I said before - so happy and so sad at the same time which is maybe why it would fit so well for this. 


Anyway here's the song I'm talking about, called 'The Children':

Now we know all of the horrible things Littlefinger has done to the Starks and their family (which triggered wars in this story), but Jon and Sansa do not. Only a select few people left alive in the story know how Littlefinger betrayed Ned's trust earlier on and told Lysa to lie to Catelyn about the Lannisters poisoning Jon Arryn.
There is going to be some power change for the Vale at some point, whether it is Littlefinger claiming it for himself or him losing it altogether. 
If someone were to bring these accusations to Sansa and Jon, it would have to be someone they trust, whose words they would believe would provide enough evidence for plotting against Littlefinger. Who would that person be?
I think Tyrion is going to be the driving force that sparks the events for the demise of Littlefinger. With Varys on his side with Dany, both of them know everything they need to vote against Littlefinger. Tyrion also happens to be Sansa's ""husband"", the one person who actually treated her well during her horrible time in Kings Landing. Throughout that miserable time, Tyrion saved her countless times and never forced her to do anything she didn't want while they were together. Also, Jon will side with Tyrion because of the connection the two had earlier on in the show, as Jon admitted that Tyrion was the only honest one to him when it came to talking about the wall. Based on what we know (or assume), there has to be a coming point where Dany's side meets with Jon's side, to discuss matters involving the seven kingdoms and the impending WW threat, which is where Tyrion will reunite with Jon and Sansa and begin the downfall of Littlefinger.

I honestly feel he gets more hatred than he deserves. 

Yes, he's evil. Yes he raped Sansa. Yes he made theon his little toy. But if you look at it, he would have done what he did to Sansa to any lady Roose would set him up with. That's just his nature. And I feel theon deserved every bit of punishment for his actions against the north. Ramsey did go a little overboard tho. 
But I think his actions are justified if you look at the way he grew up. He didn't know his position in the family. Roose probably treated him badly because he was a bastard and to get a place in the family, he had to kill off his other half-brothers. And roose honestly wasn't the kind of father who would give a fuck. 
Even as a battle commander, Ramsey is great. Playing games with the enemy and all. Riding into Stannis' camp at night and killing all the horses, destroying the siege weapons. I think those are good battle tactics, however unfair. Even his place to attack stannis instead of waiting behind the walls of Winterfell. Good stuff. 

All in all, Ramsey is a very interesting character and brought a lot to the story. Right from when we meet him, I've been liking him a lot. And I guess he even got a fitting death. ",27,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In this frame, we see Jon snow exhaling, at calm. He sees the hoard of horses rushing at him but he doesn't flinch. Instead he just looks down, he's started to accept his fate. He doesn't have a single ounce of fear in him. Oh no, no he doesn't. Why would he? He's already faced it once, he's gone through the worst betrayal and pain of his life. He's felt it. He knows the exact outcome. This is truly the point where Jon Snow knows everything.


He isn't afraid to die hence why he doesn't even try to escape. No. This time he's ready to face his death. Stand his ground like a true king.

While I love both the books and the show, I'm wondering if the decisions made by the showrunners reflect that some of the most popular/interesting theories and storylines probably won't bear out. For instance, here are a few of my personal favorites:

1) Euron/Oldtown- one of the most interesting plot lines in Feast and heading into Winds IMO. Euron wins the kingsmoot and is amassing his fleet in the show, so he likely has a big role to play in S7. However, we've seen seen no mention of dragonbinder, his Valyrian steel armor/trip to Valyria, collection of priests from the various faiths, or Aeron's visions/hallucinations. Does that mean dragonbinder is likely a fake, and Euron is more likely to be included as an obstacle to slow Dany's fleet and provide Cersei with an ally? 
A lot of people believe that Sam has either the Horn of Winter or the real dragonbinder, and it appears that Jaqen H'ghar has infiltrated the citadel in Feast in order to find an ancient book about the destruction of dragons/Valeria. To be fair we've only just gotten to Oldtown, but it seems Sam's show arc there will be focused on researching the white walkers and possibly discovering that Jon and Lyanna had a child and how to heal Jorah's greyscale.

2) The Daynes- some of the most interesting (and tinfoily) theories revolve around the Daynes, including Dawn/Lightbringer, Ned/Ashara, Ashara/Targ, the house with the red door, Darkstar and Edric (Ned) Dayne, Dany actually being a bastard, etc. However aside from Bran's vision of the duel at the TOJ and a snap of Dawn laying against Lyanna's bed, there is really no mention of the Daynes at all in the show. Does this cross off most of these theories? 

3) Stannis's northern campaign- we're obviously well past it in the show, but I wonder what the end of S5/S6 means for the pink letter, the lake trap, Mance, Theon/Asha, the great northern conspiracy, Shireen, the Battle of Ice, etc. I know Stannis isn't the real Azor Ahai either way and it sounds like Shireen will somehow meet a similar fate in the books, but the plot lines are so different that perhaps the books will reach roughly the same end to that story, and more quickly than anticipated. 

There are other big differences as well (such as Varys's schemes)- but I guess a simpler way to ask is how congruent will the end of the stories told by the books and show end up being. The end will be the same, but what about the means?",8,17,False,self,,,,,

Had an idea for how things could have happened... obviously this was always a long shot, but I'm proud enough of it to want to put it forth, for general derision and ridicule. That'll teach me to have thoughts!

So, everything about Sansa and the Boltons would go about the way it did, up until..

**The Betrayal:** Ramsay moves against Roose when his half-brother is born, but it goes down a little differently in this version. First, he aims for Walda and the babe first, and crosses them off without much trouble. Phase two, killing his father, is where it goes pear shaped, because this time, Roose *isn't* inexpliciably unprepared for his obviously treacherous sons obvious treachery. Ramsay ends up the cells of Winterfell, with Roose alive and well.

**Sansa and Jon Raise Armies:** This part goes pretty similiarly,but Sansa takes a little more of the lead herself... even when she discovers the big twist of the season, that she's pregnant by Ramsay.

**The Battle:** Jon and Sansa come to Winterfell with an army that has closer to equal numbers (maybe the Knights of the Vale have already joined.) Roose goes to visit Ramsay. Ramsay makes his case that he's still the one to carry on the Bolton name and advance their family's interests, as ruthlessly as necessary, especially now (given his demonstrated skill as a military commander.)  Eventually Roose consents to give him another chance; Ramsay will be given control of the cavalry only, with Rickon as a bargaining chip. If he's able to break the attackers and re-take Sansa, he'll be allowed back into Roose's rather chilly good graces. Otherwise, Roose is still rid of his problem son without having to resort to kinslaying, and the cavalry wouldn't be worth much in a siege besides.

Ramsay uses and kills Rickon in much the way he did in the show. The battle is bloody on both sides, but at the end Ramsay is killed by whoever (Jon, Sansa or Brienne are all obvious choices, but some people might find it cathartic for him to just die to a Lord of Bones style thumping from Tormund.) But, they're unable to immediately storm the castle, as Roose kept the infantry in reserve; a siege is far from a certain thing.

**Sansa Bolton's Moment of Glory:** The men and military commanders debate whether to risk storming Winterfell, or risk Sieging it. Sansa sees the discussion going nowhere, and instead offers to enter the castle, alone, to parley with Roose. Everyone's horrified, but she does it anyway.

Upon meeting Roose, she says something to this effect (Probably not her words.)

""I am carrying your grandson, your only current heir, the last relative of Ned Stark, and the only chance the Boltons have of the North ever not rising up against them.""

"" If you don't let me leave this castle, I may survive the next few months or I may not, but I promise, the child will not. I will find a way to end this pregnancy.""

""If you let me leave this castle unhappy, I will take the knights I trust most and hide far from here. The story spreading through the north will be that the baby is a Lannister, or a Stone, or a Snow, but not a Bolton. Even if you survive the siege, somehow find it, you will never prove the child is mine, let alone Ramsay's.""

""Or, you may have exactly what you want: A Bolton dynasty ruling the North from a position of strength and sability. You and your armies may return to the Dreadfort. I will rule from Winterfell as Queen Regent in the North, but unlike my brother, I will actually listen to your advice on matters of military and politics. When your grandchild is old enough, you may visit Winterfell to teach him how to deal with the practical matters of rulership... of course, I will spend far more time with him, teaching him about not being pure evil.""

""The child will have your name, your blood and your Machiavellian insights into politics; he will also have the Northerner's loyalty towards Ned Stark's grandson, and will not have to put up with theconstant rebellions any other heir you manage to create will face. This is the best chance House Bolton will ever get.""

**The Happy Ending**

The Stark name ends, sure, but their descendants still rule the North. Sansa is finally back in her home, master of her own fate, ruling her people. The Boltons officially rule the North, but their moral and emotional upbringing starts with Sansa and her allies, so there's no reason they'll still be monsters. And, brightest of all, the Hybrid: Stark and Bolton fused, with the loyalty of the entire North (even the Boltons), but without the Stark's trademark lack of any political acumen, the King that was Promised: lil' Ned Bolton.

(As a final note, I think this plot is actually a lot better from a feministic perspective, in light of Sansa's rape. As it actually happened, barring S7 surprises, that scene was just about pure shock value, with a side of cliche'd character development... one more round of Kick the Sansa, which could have been pretty much skipped by having her just go with Brienne over Petyr in the first place. This way Sansa's wedding night was not only actually crucial to the plot, but sort-of her taking control of her own destiny even then... she married Ramsay believing it was the sacrifice she had to make to take control of the North. In this version, it was exactly that, and both more empowering and more true to the kind of choices noble women in her society have to make.)

Whose death would be most heartbreaking for you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5t1waq/everything_will_any_of_the_protector_characters/,Forest_Steps,1486665666,"There are several great characters whose main role in the story has been to protect and/or advise some of our favorite Starks, Lannisters and Targs. Many of them have other interesting and important arcs as well to be sure. Unfortunately, a logical endpoint for many of these story arcs is to make the ultimate sacrifice and die protecting one of the main heroes either directly or indirectly (like Hodor for Bran, Yoren for Arya/Gendry). Essentially, characters who put themselves at great personal risk to help the main characters. Some of the major remaining characters include:

1) Jorah- volunteered himself back into slavery for Daenarys, willing to fight to the death, infiltrated Vaes Dothrak, etc

2) Edd- protected Jon's body and stood up to Thorne and the NW that backed him, rallied the free folk to come to Jon's defense

3) Benjen- Coldhands, in the show at least, saved Bran and Meera. Probably haven't seen the last of him

4) Hound- saved Sansa from the mob, said himself that he was watching over Arya, headed north with a newfound purpose 

5) Grey worm- completely loyal to Danaerys, commander of her army, nearly died at the hands of the harpy 

6) Brienne- rescued Sansa, nearly rescued Arya, sworn to the Starks. 

7) Tormund- rallied the free folk to protect Jon's body and fight beside him at Winterfell

8) Meera- Bran

9) Bronn- getting paid, to be sure, but has saved both Tyrion and Jaime


Again, obviously a lot of these characters have other really important roles too (such as Tormund saving and leading the free folk).

It was referred to it as such, so I guess reading through the first time I just assumed he'd found Azor Ahai's sword somewhere, but he just tried to remake it with his own sword by stabbing it into a pile of burning Seven relics? I knew he'd stabbed it into the relics, but I always assumed it was already the real sword that had lost it's power somehow.

Does this confirm that Lightbringer was an allegory? I'd heard a theory somewhere that Lightbringer was an allegory for the Night's Watch. Or is the real Lightbringer sitting in someone's trophy collection somewhere? I would just think that with how many people we see claiming to be the Prince that Was Promised that someone would have come forth with the real one (Probably using it to strengthen their own claim) by now if someone had it. 

I'm fairly sure that none of us know for sure, but now I'm curious to hear anyone else's thoughts.

I thought that by the end of season 3(1) we established two things about the show :

- Your FAV character is not safe.

- Brutal and gruesome things are gonna happen.

For me the final straw was, some movie/comic/tvshow critics praising season 6 as the BEST season. Okay, I can live with that, but when they started explaining why they liked it, it was basically : ""YAAAY FOR THE GOOD GUYS AND NICE STUFF IS HAPPENING"". 

GoT is not Star Wars, haven't you got the memo by now? 

Second thing that got me off the rails, is death of one major character after season 3. For crying out loud, how can you still be shocked with this? How??? Have you missed all the tabloid and media shit storms about every death previously and how they were unexpected and how ""fans"" reacted?

What is the reason you are watching GoT? Twist deaths and brutal scenes are part of its shtick, like new spells in Harry Poter or new tech in Iron Man, just think for one second and you don't have to overact every time it happens, because when you do I think people should question your intelligence. These are not some intricate plots hidden in the subtext, it is what everybody is talking about, because its a climax and a trend in the sowh. Honestly for all the praise GoT gets,  a  lot of its viewer base reminds me on the soap operas and teen-vampire shit. ""OOH THEY HOOKED UP AGAIN, OOOH NOH THEY KISSED, OOOH THEY ARE BREAKING UP AGAIN' week after week. 

Why this worries me, is that these backlashes discourage GoT and other TV shows from doing their thing. A good outside example would be whining about the ""torture porn"" in the latest Walking Dead season, Jesus Christ I adamantly hate torture porn, yet I thought that the violence was kind of meh, not that gruesome really. 

Again, I think the main problem comes from people watching too much tame media, they hear the hype, they come to see this piece of art, then they complain how it doesn't adhere to their special standards of entertainment. ",17,1,False,self,,,,,

Tywin represents the more antiquated, medieval lion persona of post-Arthur England.  He is a killer , he mercilessly destroys his enemies and their children like a male lion kills off the young of females in his pride once he takes over.  He is also a skilled political leader, he knows how to take his personal desires out of the way (like revenge against the Tyrells for siding with Renly, trying to steal Sansa, etc) in favor of the bigger political game.  But his Lion persona is also what ended up killing him.  He was so busy looking for power and influence that he didn't notice the more simple and personal issues in his family.  

Cersei is the personification of a lioness, fiercely loyal to her children, willing to even stand up to much more powerful lions and other animals to protect her children.  Now that her children are all dead, Cersei won't last much longer as the only things that intelligently/politically motivated her are gone and she'll revert back to the spiteful spoiled child she's always been.  

Lastly there's Jamie who IMO represents the more Disney-esque version of a Lion.  He's brave, handsome, and before his imprisonment/behanding he had a beautiful mane and claws sharper than anyone else.  But he also represents the typical flawed Disney character.  Despite all his strength and morals he still acts in regretful ways that constantly haunt him and he's unsure of who he really is after so many years of trying to be the golden lion everyone wanted him to be.  His character arc is the most interesting as he turns from Disney Lion into more of a Byronic hero.

And for those asking about Tyrion, he's a Dragon not a Lion.  He doesn't share the lion's general disdain for everyday people.  He also doesn't have the Lion's thirst for blood.  Instead, he shares the desire for intelligence personified in Master Aemon Targ.  He also has a desire to help the common folks which, from what Ser Barriston told us, matches Rhaegar Targ's personality (remember Tyrion likes to sing as well).  ",13,22,False,self,,,,,

(Theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5tbei7/everything_did_jon_arryn_have_a_plan_regarding/,itsalexdean,1486776826,"So Jon realized that Robert's children were not true Baratheons after reading The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, where he sees that in every match between a Baratheon and a member of another house, the Baratheon black hair always dominates.

Obviously after reading this and looking at Robert's 3 blonde children he realized the truth. It is later said that Ned Stark realized that Gendry was Robert's bastard son as soon as he saw him so we can assume that Jon Arryn noticed it as well the first time he saw him.

I always found it a bit weird that Jon Arryn visited Gendry several times. He probably could've found out what he wanted to know just by looking at him (Dark hair, looks exactly like a young Robert) and asking him a few questions the first time, so why continue to visit him unless he wanted to get to know him personally?  

We later learn from Pycelle that Jon Arryn planned to act on the discovery and tell Robert what he had found out. Personally i think the reason why Jon Arryn kept visiting Gendry might be because he wanted to have Robert legitimize Gendry as a Baratheon and thereby Robert's heir after he had spilled the beans about Cersei's bastard children. 

By that time Robert would have no real heirs bar his brothers, and as Robert was also getting older and in worse shape it might not have been as likely that he would remarry or even be interested in doing so. Jon Arryn might have kept revisiting Gendry to find out whether he sometime in the future would be fit to rule. 

Might be a bit of a tinfoil theory, but just something i started wondering about... also because i really fucking want Gendry to become legitimized and become the lord of Storms End next season, that is if he ever decides to stop rowing. ",19,54,False,self,,,,,

People interpret it as ""all men will die eventually, they are not immortal"". But what if GRRM and D&amp;D had put the ending in front of our eyes, thinking that nobody would guess that all men literally die at the end of the story, because it would seem too extreme? What if all men (not all men in the world, the story in Norse mythology is a bit extreme and I don't think that GRRM would exaggerate it that much, but all major male characters) will die in the story, in the apocalypse?

I will shortly explain what happens in the end in Ragnarok, in Norse mythology. I think most people must have heard by now that there are undeniable parallels between ASOIAF and Norse mythology, it's not a secret that GRRM had based his story on mythology and history, there are clear references to Norse mythology and British history in the books. 

Ragnarok is known as the apocalypse of Gods, and all Gods die in the end. All Gods are men, women are Goddesses. The common interpretation is that only Surtr, a giant who carries a flaming sword survives the final battle, he burns everything and that way wins the war against the monsters. Other than him, possibly a few Goddesses and female giants, and 2 children survive the apocalypse (a boy and a girl)...and the world is rebuilt and repopulated that way. 

These characters are the counterparts of Norse Gods in our story (not a complete list but only those I know or I am sure of):

TYR: Tyr-ion. Tyr is not a dwarf but a man with one hand, so people tend to think that it can be Jaime, but I think that's just GRRM's trick. In 1993, in his original draft Jaime didn't exist as a character (the character named as Jaime then was Cersei), only Tyrion existed as the brother of a villanious Lannister. It seems like later GRRM divided the character into 2, and gave some attributes of the original Tyrion (Tyr) to Jaime. But Tyrion the dwarf is the one who kept the name referencing the God named Tyr in Norse mythology, so Tyrion represents Tyr now. Tyr dies in the final battle, killing the biggest monster and being killed by it. Tyrion may eventually ride a dragon and that way kill a big monster in the end, possibly a wight dragon if one of the dragons dies and is resurrected by WW at one point. Or maybe he kills Cersei and is killed by her, if we think Cersei can be the ultimate monster.

FREYR: Jaime. Jaime's story is almost the same with Freyr's story. Freyr is the twin brother of Freyja, who is obviously Cersei. They have an incestious relationship, but later Freyja marries Odin and Freyr falls in love with a female giant, marries her and they have a son together. Female giant=Brienne. Freyr has to give away his magic sword in order to get that female giant, and he dies in the final battle because he lacks his magic sword and he can't fight as good as before without it. In our story Jaime loses his sword hand when he saves Brienne from the rapers, so he can't fight anymore. And he also gives his magic sword to Brienne. Freyr is the last God who dies in the final battle, he is killed by Surtr (I think Surtr won't kill him in our story, but maybe he will die protecting Surtr, I will explain why, later) but he leaves an heir behind, his child with that female giant becomes the king in the future. 

ODIN: Euron. Odin is a one-eyed God, he returns from exile and rules for some time, he is the husband of Freyja, and there is a thing called Odin's horn. He is an immoral God and obviously Euron in GRRM's story, in the books Euron wears an eye patch because he lost one eye, he returned from exile and he has a horn. If we think in the light of both the books and the show, Euron and Cersei will probably ally/marry at one point against Daenerys and other enemies. Odin is killed by a giant wolf in Ragnarok in Norse mythology. The giant wolf who will kill him in our story can be Bran warging into a dragon, or maybe Arya (either herself or warging into a wolf).

LOKI: Littlefinger. Loki is a trickster, he is a smart but immoral, deceitful and greedy God. Loki kills and is killed by one of the Gods, named Heimdallr, they slay each other. I don't know who can be Littlefinger's Heimdallr, but he will be killed by one of the major characters, not by a monster-WW. 

THOR: Tor-mund. Thor is the physically strongest God, he has red hair and beard. Thor dies in the final battle, killing and being killed by the monstrous serpent Jrmungandr. I don't know who could be Tormund's Jrmungandr in our story, either, but it suggests that he will be killed by a monster, a WW or a wight.

These are the obvious ones, but there are more Gods who die in Ragnarok, so Davos, Theon, Bran, Sam etc. (maybe Ned and Robb too) may be representing the rest. 

So it is possible that all men, meaning that all male characters who represent the characters in Norse mythology will die in the apocalypse. And I strongly believe that Daenerys will die too, after giving birth to Jon's child. The prophecy told to Daenerys says that ""she will see Drogo again (implying that she will die, Mirri Maz Duur believed in afterlife) when the mountains blow in the wind (the wall is a mountain, it will fall and its pieces will blow in the wind), when the seas go dry (the seas will be frozen, they won't be liquid anymore), when the sun sets in the east (perhaps a big fire in the east in an evening that will look like an eastern sunset) and when she bears a living child (most likely Jon's child). 

So, 2 children surviving the apocalypse will be Jon-Daenerys baby and Jaime-Brienne baby. Daenerys and Jaime will die (Daenerys possibly at childbirth and Jaime possibly protecting Jon, he is Rhaegar's son and Jaime had promised Rhaegar to protect his family although he had failed at the time). Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Yara, Gilly etc. will be the women who will survive the apocalypse and raise those children (maybe either Sansa or Arya will marry Jon in the future, when it is revealed that they are cousins, and after Daenerys dies and the war is over). 

Now, the only male character that survives the apocalypse is Surtr, the giant carrying the flaming sword. SURTR is obviously Jon. Jon will be the only man among the heroes who will survive and will become the king. I think he can burn everything in the end like Surtr, all the remaining monsters, possibly riding Rhaegal, the dragon that carries his father's name.

Because Jon has already died. So technically, all men will die in the story, except that Jon is resurrected. It doesn't say that ""all men must die and never come back"", Jon died too, so technically all men die in the end...only Jon will still be around like a ""Ghost"", like the name of his wolf, because he died but he is still around.",53,178,False,self,,,,,

When Eddard Stark was the Hand of the King back in season one, he could have ordered the Hound to watch over his family, especially his daughters.  When Arya and Sandor were traveling together, it could have been easy just to leave or kill her, but instead he tried to bring her back to her family.  He claimed it was for the money, but when he left King's Landing he didn't really care about anything anymore, so money could be just an excuse to tell Arya.  If you think about, he was there when all of the major Stark events happened, except when he was presumed dead.  He was at the Red Wedding, but too late, he was at the Vale, but too late for the queens death, and he was there for Arya when she needed him.  It makes if you think about it, but it may be stretch.

A few episodes before Gilley asks Stannis' daughter how she didn't die from it and she didn't know cause she was too young when they ""cured it"" , or stopped the spread. I might be reading in to this too much, but I think that might be exactly how she lost the grey scales, and because of that Stannis devoted his life to the Lord of Light for saving his daughter. That might be why it is so hard for him to question Lady Melisandre from the start. If it's true then the story of how Jorah might follow Dany's orders to find a cure could get really interesting.

Khal Drogo dies and she ""wake dragons from the stone"" eggs creating Lightbringer (dragons), who take years to be forged(growing). 
The Lightbring are the dragons, simple as that. How the hell one single warrior with one single flaming sword would beat 1 milion wights?

Jon Snow was born under the protection of a fallen star (sword Dawn, literally forged from a meteority), from the lineage of Rhaegar Thargaryan who said that his son is ""the Prince that was promised, he is the song of ice and fire (stark/targaryen).

Said that, its very clear who is Azor Ahai and who is the TPTWP. I see a lot of theorys about other characters. Cut it you fools!

Maester Aemon, Melisandre and all the red priestss agrees with me.

Or am i missing something?

Edit: Basically im saying Danny = AA and Jon = TPTWP. 

Edit 2: Maybe if the prophecies are talking to same person, its still clear that Daenaerys is Azor Ahai. She fullfill all requirements. (Kills lover, wake dragon from stone, reborn in salt and smoke, red comet, lineage of Jaeherys). Not to mention she is fire proof, i nice thing to be the Fire Warrior aka Azor Ahai.

""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone"". 

Its clearly refering to Daenerys rising as the Mother of Dragons after the pyre.

The only thing that put in question Dany beeing AA is Jon pretention because of the ''song of ice and fire'' thing. Thats why AA and TPTWP beeing different people is plausible.

-by marrying Gendry to Dany, Dany will have both Baratheon and Targaryen support, a union nobody ever expected

-The Marriage will only be for show and Dany will only be using Gendry for his dick and treats him as a prisoner

-This will prompt Arya to go to King's Landing and save Gendry

-Their son will be the true heir of the ironthrone and Dany will be the queen, unquestioned

I see so many parallels to the events in this show and real life right now. We have a bunch of people arguing about petty politics and power all the time (much akin to the fight for the Iron Throne) and in the meanwhile, there are a small subset of people (scientists in real life, the men at the Night's Watch in the show) who are trying to warn the rest of the world/kingdom about an imminent danger that is threatening to quite literally destroy humanity (climate change or the White Walkers). The Night's Watch/scientists get ignored because their cries for help get drowned in the politics. 

In this last season, it is starting to look like no one will actually care about this threat until the threat is quite literally knocking on their door. In real life though, im not quite sure Climate Change can be combated in the last minute. 

I personally think it would be great if the show ended with the White Walkers ruling the world. It would send a great statement about the current political climate and a call to straighten out our priorities and save our Earth. ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

Someone commented that while Dany did amass a powerful force and certainly had built a lot of strength from relatively nothing, someone else was doing better than her. As in, this commenter said something I believe about a long lost cousin or unknown-to-Dany Targaryen or someone in general who was doing something similar to Dany but was leaps ahead of her in terms of army size and general power potential.

Figuring her and Jon will have a thing together, aunt-nephew relationship aside. Azor Ahai was only able to successfully temper Lightbringer by killing his wife with it; ergo victory can only come with great sacrifice.

So why would GRRM, the man with the cruelest pen in living literary memory, let us go without any major punches to the feelings after the Red Wedding? 

Could the legend of the Forging of Lightbringer be foreshadowing the death of Daenerys as the final tragedy of the series, with Jon being Azor Ahai, and she Nissa Nissa?

Naturally at times like this my mind wanders and I began to converge my two loves, GOT and rugby. 



It is time to decide upon the staring XV for a Westeros team. I thought about having a Stark Representative v Lannister side but for now it is just a combined team to tour the Summer Isle and Slavers Bay. I wnet for Westerosi only, although Khal Drogo, Strong Belwas and Daario would be pretty handy.



I thought I would ban Giants....nightmare to tackle but no space on the team coach. Also only characters who have been active in the books/show. Rhaegar would be the 1st choice fly half given his seemingly given his athleticism, strength and  ability to be good at pretty much everything he turns his mind too. Also the best looking player on the team!




Front Row:
1: Hot Pie. He has the size, shape and love of baked goods of a natural prop. Also not afraid to get stuck into a brawl. Has street smarts learnt from the streets of Kings Landing.

2: I thought Sam would be a natural hooker, he has the size and intelligence plus some hidden inner strength. However he needs far to much encouragement stop feeling so craven. Therefore  Lord Wyman Manderley will bring his sizeable bulk and leadership to the team.

3: Hodor. Strong, can carry all day and likes to keep it simple.




Second Row:
4: We will need some ballast behind such a heavy front row and given the requirement for a sizeable character the Mountain is the obvious choice. Savage in the tackle, his ball carrying skills will be vital.

5: Brienne. Hungry to prove herself, size and speed. 


Back Row:
I would like to play Gendry, he is strong, quick but his tendency to go missing for long periods means he misses out. I have gone for a back row that will not take a step backwards, they might  have a nasty streak but you want them on your side.

6: Sandor Clegane will be a terrific back row. Brutal in defence, lethal going forward. Happy to do the things most players balk at.

7: Mance. A leader and someone who might be able to get this pack to work as a team. 

8: Har! Tormund is our man. Big, mean and a leader. 




Scrum Half:
9: Little Finger is the only choice. He as the small stature but more importantly he can control the game his tactical awareness and ability to look 10 phases in advance is key.





Fly Half:
10: I thought Robb Stark would be the natural choice but unless he can stop making poor decisions he just wont make it. Ramsay is too liable to be given a red card. I have decided to go with Jon Snow. He might know nothing but Little Finger is there to give direction. Jon is a highly skiled attacker and will bring the best out of the backs. Key leadership.





Centres:
12: Stannis is the mannis for inside centre. Stout, dependable, will not go backwards in defence and handy attacker. Does not know when he is beaten.

13: At outside centre we need some flair to unlock the opposition defences. Oberyn Martell is the man. He is a natural showman, undoubtedly skilled.




Wings:
11: Jamie Lannister (two handed version). Golden boy of the team, quick, killer instinct and a wingers natural selfishness. 

14:Arya, the youngest on the team and by far the the smallest, her finishing skills have come on leaps and bounds. Lethal. 


Full Back:
Bronn is dependable, not much gets past him and also pretty deadly in attack.



 I appreciate the scope might be somewhat limited to those who understand the game but feel free to make your own side or contribute a player!",1,8,False,self,,,,,

I ask because it seems like it would have been easier for Mance to take his massive army to one of the unmanned gates and break through the wall that way.

The one person I just can't understand/agree on is Jamie's ranking. People always put him very high on their list of best fighters, if not number one. My question is why?

When Ned sees him in Kings Landing he jokes that Jamie's armor is barely touched so he must've picked his fights wisely, aka never really beat anyone with known skills. When he does fight Ned he appears to be losing (at least on the defense) before one of the guards helps out. So again we don't get to see Jaime actually take out someone worthy. Also in the book of accomplishments or whatever it's called Jamie's page is basically empty. We don't see it happen but in one of the only battles he leads in the show he gets captured by Robb.  

The best evidence he's top notch is him being the youngest Kings guard ever. But couldn't that have something to do with his father being one of the most powerful/richest people in the seven kingdoms? 
People in the show talk about how good he is with a sword, but couldn't it just be an exaggeration the Lannisters spread to make them seem even more powerful? 
I mean Cersei even says at one point that kings get to decide what people remember or something along those lines. I know he's not a king but they are probably the most powerful family in the seven. 

I've never read the book so maybe it goes into more details about his abilities. Anyone care to enlighten me on their reasoning for him being a top 5 fighter (with both hands obviously) other than what people have SAID.. What has he actually done?

Like for example I see people say he'd crush Jon Snow if not for the whole ""chosen one"" thing. But Jon at least in the show is so much more badass and gritty, not to mention constantly shows off his skills. Like when he goes toe to toe with the huge leader of the Thenns who looks like nearly as big as the mountain and puts a hammer through his head(just watched this last night so it really got me thinking) I can't see Jaime holding his own with that beast. 

I love Jaime, has one of the best character arcs of anyone, but anytime I've read about best warriors and see Jaime at the top I always find myself confused. Not that it matters that much but out of pure curiosity... Anyone care to enlighten me?

What is the 7th Instrument?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5uddgq/everything_music_theory_the_light_of_the_seven/,we_the_purple,1487229074,"Dear Game of Thrones Aficionados (Gotas):
Allow me to present for your consideration the following GOT music theory:
In the season six finale's first ten minutes, we hear a very remarkable piece of music, ""The Light of the Seven."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9PXLTLuuSE I believe it was composed to incorporate musical representations of the eponymous deities while accompanying the actions on screen. If you listen carefully you will hear at first a piano (1) introducing the melody, then a cello (2) providing a murmuring foundation, a very young vocal addition (3) carries the theme for a period, then an organ (4) carries it from the middle to the end with a chime or bell (5) faintly in the background hitting the same note, then violins/strings (6) enter once the piece hits its dramatic climax.
 
I tried to assign the instruments to each god or goddess (kind of like Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf) but that proved too difficult until I realized that the song isn't actually about the gods but about a twisted representation of them. Stay with me here...Maester Qyburn was the architect behind the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and the murder of Grand Maester Pycelle. He represents corruption in the series (making the Mountain undead, desecrating the duty of Maesters to heal, corrupting children, using the trial for mass murder). You can hear the song's theme mingle and play with the Lannister's theme at the end of the episode as Cersei gets crowned which convinces me that the theme is symbolic of divine corruption and of Qyburn who is the new Hand of the Queen. The song represents the inverse of what the gods actually are supposed to represent. With that context here goes: 

(1)The piano is the Mother and the central instrument that introduces the theme. The Mother deity is supposed to be all about Mercy but the punishment of Loras, the trial, and conclusion are anything but merciful. That the whole scene is Cersei's cruel fantasy realized is fitting as she is the epitome of a merciless mother. 

(2)The cello with its depth is the Father and plays a low series of repetitive arpeggios that are the base for this quasi passacaglia that never really take the melody. Fitting that the Father who brings justice and balance would be the foundation of the piece, but his part too becomes erratic as justice is never really administered. The Father is all about judgment. But his part is impotent and indecisive and only accompanies the other instruments in their melodies. The only fathers in the scene, Keven Lannister and Mace Tyrell are both powerless and dithering until their deaths. Similarly, the mortal embodiment of the Father, the High Sparrow remains simpering and oblivious, devoid of any discernment condemning all the innocent to die and letting Cersei, the most damnable, to go free through his lack of judgment causing a horrible miscarriage of justice.  

(3)The vocals are the voices of youth and virginal innocence which the Maiden represents, but the vocals enter in just as the children, who should be paragons of innocence, under the direction of Qyburn murder Grand Maester Pycelle and stab Lancel. 

(4)Just before Pycelle who is old and represents experiences dies, Qyburn tells him that the old must make way for the new. As he dies the organ starts which I believe represents the Crone. This goddess is supposed to guide others down the correct path with the lantern of wisdom and experience. In this bizzarro take on the gods, it is fitting that the Crone accompanies the death of the Grand Maester. The organ leads us from the first half and supplants the piano taking us to the chaotic ending as Lancel drops the flame that he carried into the catacombs and sees the candle-fuses showing the corruption of light's guidance. 

(5)The steady chime of the now familiar C evokes the Smith on his anvil. But he is not building or repairing anything. Nor is he tempering the fires of anger and vengeance. He is not turning back the tide of entropy, he is keeping time to the rhythm of impending destruction almost urging it on. 

(6) The Warrior is the violin or strings. The High Sparrow earlier in the scene says that the ""Warrior punishes those who believe themselves to be beyond the reach of justice."" The only warriors in the scene are the faith militant who prevent the innocent attendees in the Great Sept from fleeing just as the violins start playing. The warriors punish the innocent bystanders by using force to keep them present for the imminent green conflagration. 

Finally, most of the instruments join together in unison for the final crescendo and then the Light of the Seven's theme is subsumed into the main theme of the show signifying to me that the Faith of the Seven is just another chess piece used in the Game of Thrones. 

But wait! That's only six, where is the 7th instrument? I asked myself the same question...perhaps you'd like to think about it before I give you my answer. Watching the full video didn't tell me but listening to the audio version after I bought it separately without the break of silence in the middle where Loras confesses was helpful and gave me a clue. When the piano starts the song, there aren't really any rests from start to end. Notes are held, and sure they get quieter, but there isn't any real silence. The music cuts out only at the very end. It could have kept going and added to the drama of the explosions, but it didn't. Silence is the final instrument. Silence equals the Stranger. Here's the one deity who can't be corrupted because it has no goal, no purpose other than death. The Stranger or the god/ess of death is the sound of silence and as all those lives are snuffed out, this deity enters into the piece.  

(Disclaimer: Did Ramin Djawadi actually consider all this? His interviews don't really hint at this kind of complexity. And in the live shows he's been doing there aren't the same number of instruments when this song is played. He is a genius though. Maybe it all was coincidental, maybe it was subconscious inspiration, or maybe I'm utilizing all my powers of BS to delve far too much into something, but regardless it is fun to think about and this song deserves it for how remarkable it is.)

Tyrion is also offered the throne but declines it as well and him and Sansa, Arya, Gendry, Varys, and Edmure work together to rebuild westeros. and Gendry is put on the iron throne with Arya by his side as his queen and Tyrion is hand.

For me:

Season 1 was the original Stark vs Lannister conflict. 

Season 2 was Tyrion vs Stannis, but my least favorite season

Season 3 was my second least favorite, but the writing in the Riverlands, specifically Jaime's writing with Brienne was the best.

Season 4 had overall great storylines everywhere, but of course Kings Landing plotting with Tyrion and Tywin was like the ending of an act. And Oberyn 

Season 5 is also difficult. Stannis' downfall and Jon's rise intersected greatly, but of course the ending of Jon and Stannis were great, along with Dany's more darker side coming to light. But I'd have to go the Wall.

Season 6 is a no brainer.... Jon, Lord of Winterfell and the King of the North. I like how it intersected with Bran. Jaime also had a good storyline, as did Cersei (duh) and Dany.

980,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-2-17,2017,2,17,14,5ukgcm,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING]Does anyone else think most fan theories are too conventional for this series?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5ukgcm/everythingdoes_anyone_else_think_most_fan/,IconicIsotope,1487309018,"I don't know why it bothers me so much, but I dislike all the ""happily ever after"" and ""good guys win, bad guys lose"" and ""prophecy fulfilled"" theories that everyone has.  Maybe it's because this series is so complex and interesting.  There are literally thousands of other works of fiction out there where good guys win and everyone feels warm and fuzzy inside afterwards.  We've gotten more than conventional stories from this series and I hope it continues, don't you?

I'm not necessarily rooting for the bad guys to win.  Besides, one thing I love is even the ""bad"" guys are relatable (most of the time).  Anyways, I think it'd be a disappointing conclusion if Jon and/or Daenerys and/or any of the other ""good"" guys sit on the Iron Throne and rule Westeros.  There hasn't been real peace in Westeros since the series started.  Why would there be peace if Jon or Daenerys ruled?  Rebellions happen.  People die.  There's not going to be a happy ever after because the ""right"" person rules.  The feudal system being scrapped is a more interesting conclusion in that regard. 

Loosely related to that is the idea that war is bad and the writer is against war.  He's been conveying that war is bad the whole series.  This makes me think of the dragons vs. white walkers epicness that we've all been anticipating.  I have to admit, I think it'll be awesome, but it likely won't work out in favor of the beloved good guys.

The Dragon has three heads.  The prince that was promised.  Azor Ahai.  Etc.  Why does everyone think that these prophecies will be fulfilled?  Why are they just rehashes on past events?  Sure, in the past there were three dragonriders who took Westeros by storm.  Why does everyone think it will happen again?  What did people prophecize before Aegon?  What did people prophecize before Azor Ahai?  These all seem like red herrings to me, especially considering they sound too biblical for a writer who is atheist.  These are the things about which I'm most adamant.  I really don't want there to be second comings of this or that and fulfilled prophecies.  If Jon or Daenerys (or someone else) is really the savior, do you honestly believe they'll do everything Azor Ahai did and forge a sword and stab a loved one and so on?  Maybe metaphorically they'll do these things, but they're going to have to find their own path.

On top of all this, I never liked prophecies because they cheapen everything.  It feels like they remove free will and such.  For example, if Jon is Azor Ahai, then we know he was never in any danger.  His life couldn't have gone any other way.  He had to end up in the same position to save humanity.  What would happen if he was killed by the fookin legend of Gin Alley, Karl Tanner?  It never was going to happen because he was destined to save humanity.  Saviors make everything feel predetermined and make it seem like everything will work out because a savior is coming.  ""I don't have to stand against the White Walkers, Azor Ahai has my back.  He's gonna use his flaming sword and solo them.  It's not even a concern really because a woman in red told me about it.""

I know I'm not the first person to make these observations, I just wanted to voice it in my own way and hopefully spark some discussion about how things will play out, how the series will end, and what lessons we can ultimately learn.  Keep in mind, as a wise man once said, ""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""",10,7,False,self,,,,,

I just rewatched the whole TV series and I just realized all the houses are lining up to have women controlling them. I have a good theory about this. People have often said that is women ruled the world, there would be less violence, we (I'm a woman) would be able to negotiate better because of our nurturing nature. I'm not saying this is true, at all. But it's something that people said in the 80s and 90s, right around when Mr. Martin was writing the books. I'm wondering if that's his overall theme. Women can be just as war-like as men. And again I'm not saying all men are war-like. But it does make me look at the series from a different angle. What do you guys think? 

Lannisters - Cersei,  Greyjoy - Yara,  Targaryen - Daenerys,  Tyrell - Lady Olenna,  Frey - one of the wives?,  Bolton - technically Sansa, Tully - Edmure or his wife since he is a prisoner of the Lannisters, Arryn - Lysa was running it for a bit, but I can't see Little Finger keeping it for long,  Mormont - Lyanna, Stark - technically Arya, Martell - Ellaria Sand....ish, not officially.

I felt seasons 6's finale, where we see young Ned take Little Jon from Ned's dying sis, was a little weird. They went out of their way to make sure you know that Robert Baratheon would kill Jon if he found out who he was. They also went out of their way to make sure you didn't hear who he was. To me the answer was too obvious to be accurate. 

We know that Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped and raped Lyanna Stark and that King Rob had every Targaryen killed (save for my Khaleesi and her brother). We also see the badass swordsmen that where ""guarding"" her. To me, this meant that Jon is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. This seems too obvious to be true. If that *is* the case, why did they go all quiet when she told Ned who he was?

Does anyone have any theories or know something I don't?

Any input is appreciated for the night is dark and full of terrors.

**Edit:** When I said ""we know she was raped"" I was referring to what Sansa Stark says to Little Finger after he brings up ""how many people had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt"". I took that as fact, but them running away together makes a lot of sense after reading some of the comments.",30,0,False,self,,,,,

The Season 6 Soundtrack is amazing, and although it is probably the most consistently fantastic soundtrack of the series, it does not contain what I believe to be the best track. My favorite piece, without a doubt, is ""[You Are No Son of Mine](https://youtu.be/4iBCAZU-ZM0)"" from Season 4. ""You Are No Son of Mine"" played after Tywin's death (and it continued through the scenes where we see Varys, Tyrion, and Arya prepare to leave Westeros), and I feel that it perfectly captures the solemnity of the series. The track can be split up to three parts:

Part 1: A more somber rendition of ""The Rains of Castamere"" that slowly and smoothly transitions into Part 2.

Part 2: A very beautiful and sorrowful instrumental version of the main theme.

Part 3: The same as Part 2 (the main theme), although it is vocal instead of instrumental. The vocals are ethereal and elegant, and are complimented by the already fantastic melody of the main theme.

I have no idea how the series is going to end, but if is ""bittersweet"" as GRRM says it will be, then I think that ""You Are No Son of Mine"" would be the perfect piece to play to finish off the series (at leasts Parts 2 and 3, as Part 1 is Lannister-specific). The track evokes feelings of sadness, but it also brings about slight feelings of hope and optimism. It's a masterpiece. I'd love to hear more opinions regarding the piece.

Apparently the girl who took the pic said she was there to film GoT. 

**Background information on GoT and Direwolves on Calgary:**
 
&gt;Similarly, in Season 5, some filming was done on a sound stage in Calgary, Canada, due to work with a live stunt animal. Because the Direwolves in the story are older and have grown larger, in Season 5 they wanted to use a full-sized trained wolf named Quigley to play Jon Snow's direwolf Ghost. Quigley's trainer Andrew Simpson owns about 30 wolves, and the production team had been reaching out to him since Season 1, but he was busy training wolves for other film projects.

One is at The Crossing held by house Frey. Second is the crossing at Red Fork from Harroway's Town held by House Roote, to the Red Fork held by House Tully (the place where Robert and Rhaegar met in battle). Both of these crossings are in the River lands and swear fealty to House Tully. So why did Robb choose to cross at the Crossing?
If my understanding of the geography of Westeros is correct, the quickest way from Winterfell to King's Landing is directly south through the Neck, then choose the eastern path east of the Crossing (don't cross), hug the Riverland's/Vale border east of the Green Fork but west of the Vale's western mountains, then cross at the Trident. If Robb chooses to cross at the Crossing, he has to go around west of Riverrun.
If he chooses the Red Fork path, his path is literally in a direct line to King's landing, where as if he crosses through the Crossing, he heads directly south instead of South/Southeast and then has to verge South/Southwest a bit to go around Riverrun and then he can finally head East/Southeast towards Kings Landing, but by then he is already about I'm guessing a four days ride west of where he would of crossed if he crossed at the Red Fork.
Was it because of Jamie Lannister army somewhere blocking that path and he needed to cross quickly no matter what instead of halting because of his father being in danger? Was Tywin's army around that area? I don't get it? Am I missing something here. I've always wondered about this.

Jon Snow was always all about duty and honour like Ned, but when he was with the Wildlings he broke his vows by being with Ygritte. I know that just sleeping with a girl isn't that big a deal to the Nights Watch but it's like Ser Alliser said ""There's a difference between sneaking off to the Molestown brothel and sleeping with the enemy."" 

It's obvious that Jon truly loved her and I think that's what helped him refuse Stannis' offer of becoming Lord of Winterfell. He wanted that with Ygritte and since that wasn't possible it was easier for him to say no. I think that had she survived, he'd have taken that offer and maybe even married her as a way of formally bringing the Wildlings into the fold. I know Stannis wanted to arrange the marriage of Jon to Val in the book, which he also refused, and I think that if it was Ygritte instead he'd have been much more likely to say yes.

So I guess I'd like to hear your opinions on it in 2 scenarios. If she had survived the Battle of Castle Black, do you think Jon still would have still refused Stannis? And he would have accepted, would the Battle of the Bastards have happened the way it did? Maybe less houses would have followed him if he were married to a Wildling due to their hatred of them (though I don't think it would make much difference as he was already leading an army of them) or maybe they'd have not backed him because they saw him being unwed as an opportunity for them to marry into the Stark family (though again I don't think so as he was still a bastard).",4,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

Although The Hound has a conversation in Season 6 that seems to imply that maybe they are all one in the same and that there is no specific Gods watching over them. But for the sake of argument let's say there are different Gods at work.

Whom would be the strongest/most transparent in their manifestations on Westeros?

Although the Faith of the Seven seems to be the most prominent in terms of sheer number of believers (The New Gods), we don't really see any actual evidence of their blessings/abilities/direct influence on events or for their worshipers. Even with seven faces to turn towards for various pleas for strength, their will seems to be completely open to interpretation based on who's speaking for them.

The Old Gods seem almost equally as nonexistent in terms of actually being there for their followers or answering calls of prayer. Although it seems ""Warging"" is almost an exclusive property of Northerners/Wildlings and seems often attached to the plants and animals of nature and thus maybe could be considered a blessing from the Old Gods. Other than that they seem almost as aloof as the Faith of the Seven in terms of usefulness.

R'hllor seems to have the most concrete evidence of his subjects being given blessings and/or abilities based on the worship of him. Members of the Brotherhood are regularly brought back to life after being cut down by their adversaries, and in Jon Snow's case, even brought back to life a day or so after being 100% dead. The Lady Melisandre demonstrates more witchcraft like abilities that she attributes to the Lord of Light, but it's hard to say if those aren't just her using witchcraft itself and attributing it to the Lord of Light out of convenience to her cause.

The Drowned God/Storm God are exclusive to the Iron Islands. Although their methods are crude it's debatable whether or not their worship actually provides results. As the act of ""Drowning"" devotees seems to have the occasional rate of failure when it comes to resuscitation. So the actual acts of resurrection may just be ascribed to luck and a poor understanding of human anatomy and how we handle being drowned and saved. lol. 

Now the Many Faced God is a strange one. Because rather than attributing itself to it's own sect it instead claims to be a piecemeal system of belief that all other religions borrow from, or vice/versa. There's actually some confusion as to whether R'hllor IS also the God of Death. As followers of both religions use the term ""Red God"" to describe him. Regardless, the results of following this faith are very transparent, if not extremely hard to find and master. Because it's quite clear that through using the sorcery of switching out various faces, the ""Assassins Guild"" is able to continue it's work with impunity. Only problem is even though the Many Faced God clearly has a direct influence on the ability of his assassins, it's so difficult to actually earn these rites that his influence on the world is actually quite small due to an extremely low number of followers worthy of his blessing.


TL;DR,

Faith of the Seven - No clear influence beyond powerful people's interpretation of their laws.
Old Gods - No clear influence beyond speculative ""warging"" blessings seemingly exclusive to their followers.
R'hllor - Clear influence on prayers for resurrection. Other witchcraft unclear if due to the Red God's blessing.
Drowned God - No clear influence or distinction whether drowning is magic or just ignorance of anatomy.
Many Faced God - Clear influence on complete image transmogrification. Extremely hard to earn and execute.

So, the last scene of season 6 is in Kings Landing, Qyburn is crowning Cersei Queen of the Andals etc. Thanks to Cersei's firework-fiesta, basically every person who held power in KL are dead, except Cersei herself and her close friends: Qyburn and a walking corpse. Let's assume unGregor remains her bodyguard. 

I can't see paranoid Cersei giving away any power if she don't feel she have to and as Queen, I doubt she does. Jaime has returned, but I can't see him assuming any new mantle of power, he'll remain Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, that's his shtick. So unless there are some new unintroduced or outside players in S7 (Euron as master of ships maybe?), my guess is Qyburn will basically assume every powerful role of the small counsel + Hand of the Queen.",19,1,False,self,,,,,

He always served the king but then Joffrey became king and Clegane decided he is not worth the effort. I also think that Arya changed him in a way and he really liked and also respected her.
In the end of season 6 he is with normal and kind people building a sept... isn't that an I-want-to-change action? It feels like he shows repentance for the bad things he has done.
In addition to that we don't know what his next plan will be, but I like the idea of the Hound looking for Arya and offer her his services so he would be her guardian angel like Brienne is for Sansa.

-Jon as King in the North
-Sansa and Littlefinger conspiring either together or apart
-Bran returning across the Wall
-Arya returning to Westeros
-Brotherhood Without Banners going North with the Hound
-Melisandre heading South
-Dany et al. landing in Westeros (now includes Dorne/Tyrells/Yara+Theon/Unsullied/Dothraki)
-Euron chasing Yara/Theon; joining the game
-Cersei as Queen
-Jaime juggling redemption and Cersei
-Sam in the Citadel
-Jorah searching for a cure

I think the best opportunities for character development this year are Jaime (finally) and Theon (though he's not my favorite); but overall I'm most excited for Samwell's storyline. Obviously whatever he learns in Old Town will be hugely significant, and there's also the potential for his plot to become mixed up with Jorah's, and for Randyll to make things more interesting. I'm not expecting too long an Old Town plot, before Sam heads back North, but what we get should be good.

""Villains are only Heroes of an opposite side"". 

Imagine if all we have read from the books/seen in the tv show is in fact just the history written by the winning house in order to legitimate its claim on the throne. This story could be the ""official propaganda"" of the winning side at the end of the war.
For instance, at the end of the book, we discover that Samwell is the writer and that Jon or sansa is making comment on what he is writting such as: ""Good job inventing me that targaryen origin, Ned bedded so much whores around the kingdom, we had to restore his honor so my claim would be good"". 
In this vision, the Starks or Daenerys or whoever would ""win"" at the end would justify his claim by this ""positive"" story. We could look at all the major event in another ""light"". For instance, maybe Eddard was truly a traitor who tried to steal the thrones from Joffrey. Maybe the Starks did poison Joffrey and then made it in the ""official story"" as if the tyrells did it. Maybe Robb and his mother died during an uprising of his soldier because he was a tyrannic commander and they invented the red wedding to add ""drama"" to their family.

If we look on hints of that ""habit"" in the show, look at Grand Maester Pycelle. He is always twisting stories in order for the Lannister to be the ""good heroes"" and the starks to be the ""vile traitors"". No doubt that this story may be as biased and that in the end, we could see that everything was an invention to make the starks looks better. Maybe the starks are just a barbaric house greeding for power.

That would be sure to make a ""bittersweet ending"", realizing that everything we read was just a ""fable"" to legitimate a cruel house, that all the ""villains"" were just similar houses, probably having more honor than the starks.

What do you think about that possibility?

[EDIT]: 
I'm not saying that the end is ""it was all a dream/nothing existed"". It is lame as hell and not ""good enought"" for GOT. I'm just saying that the facts are quite the same, sometime slightly exagerated, but the logic/presentation of it is not. Starks are quite presented as the noble house that is dying because of the treacheries of sly houses, but they might prevail in the end, and those past stories of treasons might justify the cruel things they will do later to achieve power. 
However, I agree with a lot of you, it is not a satisfying ending as it is, but could be a good ""hint"" on what GRRM might do in a 1000 times better way to give us an amazing ending.",45,117,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I knew that Joffrey is a dick, and I knew that Tyrion is a dwarf, and I knew that lots and lots (and lots) of characters die. But I've kind of hit this point in the first book where I'm just not sure I want to keep reading - not because I don't like the writing, but because I feel like everything that happened up to this point is effectively meaningless.

I mean, the Lannisters are obviously ruthless, so I was not surprised when Cersei seized the throne on his behalf and had Eddard imprisoned. I hated it, but it meant something, and it made me want to keep reading: ""Is he going to be sent to the Wall? Is he going to escape? Are they going to brainwash him and have him do their dirty work?"" Nope! He's dead. A character that I invested in, who seemed to be one of the main protagonists in the story is just... gone, apparently to make the point that the Lannisters are evil, which is something we already knew.

And then, on what appears to be another continent, almost entirely disconnected from the rest of the story, Viserys has Daenerys wed to Drogo. Drogo has Viserys killed, which is totally cool because he's a goddamn moron. But then Drogo goes into battle against another clan, and he gets an infected wound that kills him. I'm assuming, here, because I literally just finished the part where Dany gets dragged into the tent where the blood magi is doing her thing, so I don't know for sure.

But I have to assume that he dies, and Dany loses the stallion who will mount the world, and she's probably killed too. All the pages I read about how Drogo was going to go to war for her and win back the throne for their child, and not only are they both dead, but it just feels so fucking pointless and disconnected from everything else. I feel like I could have skipped every Daenerys chapter and not missed out on anything at all - like it could have been a side note in a conversation between Littlefinger and Cersei or something:

""By the way, Your Grace, it turns out that the savages killed Viserys for us, and Daenerys miscarried, and she's probably dying, so no worries on that front either. We'll have someone go fetch their bodies so you can add them to your collection of piked heads if you'd like, though.""

Venting aside - does this all start to mean something later? Or should I learn how to enjoy to having characters be killed and storylines just stop for no reason?

North - kingdom of the north ruled by a selfless ruler who holds duty over pride. Jon won't lead 1000s of men into battles he doesn't think he'll win. 

Vale - ruled by a little boy (without Lady Arryn tho) 

Riverlands - fucked up situation and ruled by a lord who literally no one likes (king harren was disliked by many lords of the kingdom of isles and rivers right?) 

Stormlands - not quite similar cuz we don't know who the lord is (the only exception) 

Westerlands and The Reach - until Cersei's actions, there was an alliance between the houses of rock and reach, similar to how it was at the field of fire. 

Dorne - ruled by a powerful woman who won't take shit from anyone. If not for Oberyn's stupidity, I don't think dorne would ally with Dany. 

It's not the exact same, but there are quite a lot of similarities. Especially in the north and the vale. It's almost identical.

Live Concert Experience - Short recap, Pics, Videos (St. Paul, MN - 2/20/17)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5vcewn/everything_last_night_was_amazing_live_concert/,storminspank,1487694421,"Let me preface this by saying that if you have an opportunity to see the Game of Thrones Live Concert Experience - do it.  Without a question it - do. it.  Pony up the money and get ready to have an incredible time.  I'm still geeked out over what we witnessed last night.  The visuals combined with the chorus, orchestra, solists, et al were just stunning.

*VIDEOS AND PICTURE GALLERY ARE LINKED AT THE BOTTOM*

I wanted to be able to take some pics and video to capture what was going on for those that won't be able to attend it live.  And while they don't do it justice compared to being there live, it's something.  I am not an advocate of live recording / pics during performances, but we had seats all by ourselves and I was able to record some media without being taken out of the moment or bothering anyone else around us.

Ramin was such a humble person.  It was as if he was a little kid with his new project that he wanted to show the world, but at the same time didn't want to brag about it.  He was an absolute treat to listen to not only on an array of instruments, but on the mic as well.

I don't know the actual production value of the show, but it had to be immense.  From fire coming out of the sides of the video board as Drogon lit up the room to the Sept of Baelor's final time standing, it was insane and intense.  We saw weirwood trees shed leaves on the stage and snow fall, as well.

They did a fantastic job of combining video clips with spoken dialogue that would interlace with the music being performed.  Sometimes the video was muted, sometimes only the video audio was heard.  There was terrific back and forth between the live music and the visuals that I really, really appreciated.

Format of the Show:
Part One (about an hour)
20 Min Intermission
Part Two (about an hour)

Some Musical Highlights:
Goodbye Brother (House Stark)
The Battle at Hardhome transitioning directly to Hold the Door. (This was my favorite part)
The Battle of the Bastards
The Light of the Seven
The Red Wedding

My only complaint on the night besides a few hot mics and technical issues was that Tower of Joy was not performed.  I realize it's a bonus track on the album, but it's such an amazing point in the entire series and the song itself is magical.

**Imgur Album:**

Again, Ramin was top-notch, and such a gentleman.  I hope the rest of the trou goes as well as last night's performance went.  I cannot recommend this concert enough, go see it.

It is hands down the best, must in depth, mind fucking, well produced series I have ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes on. 

Anyhow, I tried watching the Frontier because of Jason Momoa but couldn't get into it, tried watching Spartacus but the CGI was too overwhelming to me. I'll be giving Rome another shot, but I tried it last time immediately after GoT and the production quality just didn't seem to be on par (though I could be completely wrong). 

Anyways, I watched The 100 before GoT and really enjoyed that one. Any other suggestions? Some people have been suggesting the wire as well but I've never been a huge fan of cop shows.

Wanted to start a thread here where people post things like subtle foreshadowing, symbolism, etc that you have noticed that most people may not have.    
For me upon my 3rd watchthrough:    
Very subtle Ones:    
-When Jaime talks to Jory about the battle they fought in against the greyjoys, Jory says ""a greyjoy nearly took my eye"". later Jaime stabs a dirk through Jory's eye.    
-When Cersei and Jaime hear bran may have survived the fall, Jaime says ""i think I would rather be dead than crippled"" in season 3 Jaime becomes, errr, crippled.     
-When the hound is talking to arya about taking her to the twins he says ""we might make it to your uncle's bloody wedding""     
-When Tywin is lecturing joffery in the throneroom he ascends the stairs and says ""we could arrange to have you carried"". As he is going up the stairs their is a far shot framed through two torches in the forground. The one behind joffrey is fading, the one behind tywin is huge. https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=85    
-At the very start of the first episode, they find a direworlf that was killed by a stag. At the end of that season, the lord of the starks (wolfs) are killed by the head of the baratheons (stags).    
-Jaime doesn't kill ned because someone interrupted their one on one duel. 5 seasons later, we learn that's how Ned beat Jaimes teacher arthur dayne.    
-Theon gives his speech about how he will torture and kill whoever is blowing the horn outside winterfell. That person is later revealed to be Ramsay, whom theon begs to kill him.    
-In season 4 Littlefinger tells Robin ""People die at their dinner tables, people die in their beds, they die squatting over their chamber pots.. The four major deaths of that season are Joffery, killed at dinner, Shae, killed in her bed, and tywin killed on the crapper.    
-In the books their is a line from Theon's internal monologue ""Hodor did not know much, but no one could doubt that he knew his name.""

Pycelle knew Jon Arryn was poisoned, he admitted to Tyrion he let him die in S2 because ""he knew the truth about the queen"". This also tells us Pycelle ""knew the truth about the queen"" himself.  He didn't speak of a rumour in that scene when Tyrion sent him to the black cells (S2E03) and it may also be the first time Tyrion heard it as an affirmation from the inner circle.

Varys knew of the poisoning since he told Ned Stark. He even told him why and how in S1E05, which is both surprisingly much and too little. How could he know about the Tears of Lys if not from Pycelle, although the official explanation was a death from illness? This tells us Varys and Pycelle shared secret knowledge about this. 

The logical deduction is that the three men conspired together to silence Jon Arryn before he let out knowledge which would destabilise the regime. Varys must have found out Jon Arryn was asking too much, Pycelle provided the poison and Littlefinger got the job of delivering it to the victim through Lysa. The rest, that is setting up Starks against Lannisters, Littlefinger did for his own personal interest but the silencing of Jon Arryn was a peace keeping measure from the Small Council.

Varys then went on to set Ned on a false path of investigation, suspecting Ser Hugh of the Vale.",11,6,False,self,,,,,

Ice dragons have been spoken about in the books recently, and it's not a far fetched thing to imagine when you consider people have denied the existence of both WWs and dragons and well..they're here. 

GRRM always seems to have a point to things, I'm thinking that although this isn't a confirmed spoiler as such, it would make sense if it was Viserion given that he's named after Viserys, who wasn't good to Dany. Dany even said that Viserys wasn't the dragon..perhaps a foreshadowing of the fact the Viserion won't be a normal dragon in future, and even after Viserys' death his namesake will still provide trouble for Dany.
That's just what I've been thinking, I take spoilers with a pinch of salt, but Viserion would make sense. 
In that same bracket, it would make sense given that Drogon has acted like his namesake in that at first he was aggressive to Dany, and even went so far as to just fly off, completely against her wishes (I know the differences between book Drogo and series Drogo but this is a series SR so shh), but is now seemingly completely on her side and fighting for her. 
With Rhaegal, I'm not really sure at all. If being named after Rhaego is foreshadowing, perhaps Rhaegal will bond with Jon, as I've always assumed that Rhaego is a combo of Rhaegar and Drogo. According to the boatsex spoiler, this would make sense further as Jon would be both Rhaegar's son and Dany's lover, meaning that Rhaegal and Jon would be closely connected in not just name.

I'm not really good at expressing this kind of thing, I hope yous understand me, I love the ASOIAF universe because I feel that many things are just left for you to imagine things, connections etc. and kinda just go with it.

Let me know what you think and sorry for the semi-coherence!

Proof of this is that Margaery did not take Myrcella away from Cersei, nor did she cast her down. Belief in one, however, is what drove Cersei to take action against her.

Maggy the Frogs prophecy was introduced to the story just before Cersei started to cause trouble for herself. She was not responsible for Joffrey's or Myrcella's fate but she caused her own downfall through her attempt at thwarting Margaery. Joffrey's death, Myrcellas situation in Dorne and the perceived danger for herself after Tywins death is what brought it back to her memory.

In the books, the valonqar adds another layer to explain her panic fear and hatred of Tyrion. She had nightmarish dreams about him in her first chapter in A Feast For Crows and it is what drove her to want him dead so badly. This rippled over the Narrow Sea when the price she set on his head caused the death of Penny's brother. All this is irrelevant in the show so the valonqar was left out. Cerseis belief in Tyrion's guilt is more plausible, more rational there.

Maggy the Frog's prophecy has no direct effect on the story but Cersei's recollection of it has.
**The ""valonqar"" part of it is no indication of anything that will happen in the show.**

Discussions on who the valonqar may be miss the point the author wants to make, which is that belief in prophecies influence people. There will be no killing valonqar in the books either, but Cersei [will believe there is one](http://i.imgur.com/ldWVZvT.jpg).",28,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

This caught the attention of those seated around us and we started to discuss where everyone heard that this was a thing.  It seemed that the consensus was that a single person out of every group knew about the concert and told the others in the group (I was on Ticketmaster and stumbled across it by accident while looking for Blackhawk tickets).  It's unfortunate that so few people knew about this Concert as I think it could have easily sold out if there was more advertising for it.  

Quick tip if you do go, dish out a little bit more for better tickets.  I'd recommend on the sides so you are in the center (where the 50 yard line would be) and also in the upper 100 section or lower 200 section.  This will give you the most visual access to every aspect on stage and on the screens without having to look to hard in one direction or straight up at the screens.

TL;DR I'm wondering how people who are aware that there is a Concert Experience, came to hear about it.  ****Would recommend seeing it

I'm sure the show will want to bring back well known characters who died throughout the show to add to ratings and a feeling of ""coming full circle"".  So my question is, who are the characters that may come back and which are more likely to return than others?  Obviously some characters we know, people like [Karsi](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Karsi) were shown to already be ""revived"" as undead so that's well established.  But what about characters who we can't be sure of?  For myself, I'm wondering if Locke of House Bolton comes back.  Yes Kraster's Keep was burned down but Locke was off in the woods chasing Bran when he died.  

And my biggest question by far for the upcoming battle with the dead is when it comes to Winterfell. It seems impossible that Winterfell isn't a pivotal point in the battle with the undead, considering most of season 6 was about retaking the darn thing.  Sure they will burn all the bodies from the recent battle, but a lot of bodies have been buried in the crypts without being burnt over the years, especially the noble ladies and lords.  We've seen the Night King can raise the dead by lifting his hands, can he raise the dead of Winterfell from outside the walls during a siege?  If he raises the Winterfell crypt, do we get to see Ned again, or Lyanna, or maybe Rickon?  What about Osha and others who died under the Boltons who were likely mass buried and not burned?  

For my personal prediction for this season, I think they'll try to unite the North against the undead and have trouble getting help from the southerners who are busy with the Cercei thing.  However, the North and Winterfell will get there butts handed to them by the undead, including raising loved ones from the crypts, and like the Battle of the Bastards, be saved last minute by the dragons arriving.  That'll set up season 8 as a large pitched battle of the living and the dead with dragons, Clegane's (much hype), fire priestesses, and a sneaky assassin Stark who I think has learned how to survive death and maybe undeath?.

As I said, I didn't watch many episodes, but I know the books by heart. As the new books delays and delays and delays, I thought maybe I could try to watch the show. But I don't really have time to watch all the seasons I have missed so far.

So, can I start watching with 6th season and see how the story continues? I know that there are many differences, is there somewhere I can read about them before starting with 6th season? A detailed summery, or better, something aimed to those who read the books? I can start with 5th season too, but watching 4 seasons is just about impossible. I have judiciary exams soon, I got to study =(

With the only reason for her not escaping the situation was the crowd of lemmings blocking the exit and the Sparrows blocking her path in general ""Because you have to stay here, because reasons.""

It was a real dumb way to go.

But after thinking about it for a long while now, I realize that Margaery actually got off easy and this ending for her was preferable to surviving.

Why?

Because Tommen committed suicide after seeing the explosion of the Sept. He didn't bother to even think about whether his Queen had survived the blast, escaped or what have you. He just jumped the moment things went to hell. Subsequently allowing Cersei to make herself Queen.

If Marg HAD survived the explosion, she was still totally boned in Kings Landing. Her authority as ""Queen"" would be honored by Cersei just as much as Ned Starks parchment that claimed him as protector of the realm as Roberts dying wish. At best she would have had Gregore pop Margaery's head like a grape in front of crown and court which zero fucks to give. At worst she would have just tortured her in the dungeons as Qyburn's next pet project.

Either way, dying instantaneously in a fiery explosion was probably the best way for her to go. As nothing good could have come from her surviving to confront Cersei about her betrayal.",37,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

- [AGOT](#b ""Daenerys is sterile due to the magic of Mirri Maz Duur."")

- Geopolitics at end of season 6: 
[Season6](#s ""Jon is King in the North, Cersei Queen of Ashes (King's landing + Castlerok), Daenerys is sailing for Westeros (probably Dragonstone since Stannis is dead), Highgarden + Dorne have joined Daenerys, Eulon/Theon are sailing in a race to reach Daenerys"").

Let's see the consequences of those statements:
[THEORIES](#s ""If Daenerys conquers westeros, she won't be able to produce an heir, so when she dies, chaos will arise again. Her victory will be ephemeral. - If Daenerys marries Jon Snow for an alliance between Dragonstone (her) and the King in the North, Jon will be unable to have heirs with her, thus being obliged to cheat on her (maybe with her approval) and then to legitimize the bastard. It would be so ironic because of his moral position on the subject and his absolute refusal to raise a bastard. - Jon can end up marrying an other/become the night king that he was fighting before (Irony again).

I found it interesting during a meeting of the small council, where characters such as King Robert Baratheon, Ned Stark, Varys, Littlefinger and Grand Maester Pycelle are discussing the news that Danaerys is with child - Khal Drogos child. Robert demands she is tracked down and killed, Ned obviously objects furiously and it leads to a huge falling out between Ned and Robert and Ned steps down as hand and storms out. During the councils discussion on how to go about killing Danaerys, Varys suggests using the Tears of Lys, the untraceable poison used in the murder of Jon Arynn. 

My question is: is it all possible,  due to the mysterious and sudden nature of Khal Drogos death, that he was poisoned? I mean, for such a strong and prominent character, who poses a serious threat to the throne with Danaerys at his side, it seems silly that he'd just die of an infection. It makes sense that the throne would want him dead. Who administered the poison? Not sure. Maz Duur? Perhaps Jorah (I know, it's a stretch)? But he was an informant to the throne, giving whispers to Varys and truly loves Danaerys, perhaps he wanted her all for himself. I dunno. At the end of the day it's just a thought I had. Let me know what you think! Tell me I'm an idiot, tell me I missed something obvious, but hey, I gave it a shot!",19,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

okay if you read my part 1 then you know that the first part of the prophecy proves that Euron Greyjoy the crows eye is Azor Ahai. Now let's discuss how he will get the blood, Awaken dragons from stone, and how Azor Ahai is the true antagonist of the story and how him and TPTWP are two totally different people.

Now it is said that Azor Ahai will have to have the blood of the dragon and awaken dragons from stone and also forge lightbringer but more on that later. I think Euron will indeed kill one of Dany's dragons to get the blood. In this case i think he will kill Drogon to get the blood the reason for this is because in legend before Azor Ahai forge the blade he slayed a monster and Drogon does look like a monster.

Now for awakening dragons from stone well there he can control Rhaegal and Viserion with his horn but they are already awaken so how will he awaken dragons from stone. Well there is said to be dragon eggs at dragonston so if Euron sails to dragonstone then he could take the dragon eggs and either awaken them the same way dany did minus him going into the fire. Or he can throw them into the sea as a ritual to awaken a sea dragon or a kraken either way he will be awakening dragons from stone but it does not end there. I think there is a dragon under winterfell and Euron will use his horn to awaken it from the crypt awakening a dragon out of stone.

Now for the sacrifice it is said Azor Ahai had to kill his wife Nissa Nissa to forge the blade and her heart and sould whined into the blade. There is only one person that comes to mind for that and that is Daenerys Targaryen. I am not saying Euron loves Dany i do not think he loves anyone but he is no idiot either he knows that he will need to forge lightbringer. It is with out a doubt possible that that the prophecy was misinterpreted and the sacrifice is not someone you love but someone who has the heart and soul of fire that can be put into the blade. Now for a quick recap Euron will have to slay a monster (Drogon) to get the blood of the dragon he will then take control of Dany's two other dragons and use his horn to awaken the winterfell dragon from the crypts (out of stone) and also awaken the dragon eggs from dragonstone somehow and will kill Daenerys to forge lightbringer.

Now for why i think Azor Ahai is the villain. I believe he is think about it the re god pretty much wants people burned alive and such and also not to mention it is kindof weird so yeah also i believe again the prophecy was misinterpreted and that Azor Ahai and his dragons are the true cold breathe of darkness falling heavy on the world and he will destroy and burn the world to the ground and so The Prince that was promised will awaken to unite men and white walkers to fight off Azor Ahai and his dragons. Yes by awaken i mean Jon Snow is the prince that was promised and was brought back to unite the white walkers and humans to defeat the true cold breathe of darkness Euron (Azor Ahai) and his dragons (made up of Dany's two dragons, The dragon from winterfell crypts, and some of the dragon eggs awakened at dragonstone). Jon may also have to sacrifice someone to forge his own blade (of ice) as for his Nissa Nissa. I think it is no other then Sansa Stark. So Jon will have to Sacrifice Sansa to forge his lightbringer (an ice sword) and unite man and white walkers to defeat Euron (Azor Ahai) and his dragons. ",7,0,False,self,,,,,

Wanted to share this here and hope some find it interesting](http://i.imgur.com/BsjIxgG.png)

## Family and rise to power

- Both Houses, the Tyrells and the Boleyn family are considered powerful yet not nearly as powerful and strong as the other nobility and families of the realm (Although Boleyn was not as powerful since Anne's father was just an earl)

- Margaery Tyrell is helped and encouraged by her family to get close to the king, they push her to get close to the most powerful man in the realm, and she was very smart and knew how to get close to the king, especially how she plays Tommin (he's no Henry VIII) but she knew what she wanted, she had a plan, and she was acting on it to become queen.

- Anne Boleyn was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, the English ambassador in the French court, unlike her sister Mary, when they returned to England and entered Henry's court, she didn't let Henry just make her one of his mistresses, she knew how to play him and make him fall in love with her, that can be seen if you read their love letters to each other, she never went to his chamber because she wanted to be queen, she promised him an heir because that's what he wanted, a son, some say Henry was thinking of divorcing Catherine of Aragon even before Anne came in the picture but she knew that and she played her cards right and because a queen.

## Tragic End
- Both women are accused of incest with their brothers as well as adultery with other men in the court.
- Court Politics and powerful people benefited from their demise. (like Margaery, IMO, Anne was innocent)
- Both were presented with a confession by the court's musician after he was tortured to speak against them.
- Both were subject to a trial where evidence was manufactured to make them look guilty.
- Both were imprisoned in a cold, dark, and dirty cell in the castle/tower.

**Both women ended up dying violently and in a very tragic and sad manner. But When you play a game of thrones you win or you die. Anne Boleyn paid with her life and fate was not kinder to Margaery Tyrell.**



They're not identical, imo, [Queen Consort Margaery Tyrell](http://i.imgur.com/OIhlSgb.jpg) was more driven by the politics of it all, while [Queen Consort Anne Boleyn](http://i.imgur.com/vdnq8Ql.jpg) was also driven by passion and love as Natalie Dormer puts it too, she wanted to be queen but she loved Henry VIII (this was before he became obese). Anne Bolyn was accused of these charges but she was most likely innocent of them all especially incest, no proof was provided other than some confessions from a man who was brutally tortured. The entire show sounds like Tudor England, the game of thrones parallels the War of the Roses between cousins for the English Crown in the 15 and 16th century. 

Game of Thrones is fiction, but aside from the dragons and zombies, these events took place in someway or another 500 years ago in England ... If only we had a time machine to take us back to witness these events unfold, not to change or alter them, but to watch them unravel. 

I've been thinking about writing or maybe making a podcast about the Tudors and other interesting people from a time gone by, although I study engineering, I find reading about historical figures very interesting and I hope you liked it.

I know a lot of people think BOTB or TWOW is the best ep. But here's why I think it's this one. 

The first and foremost, is the Stannis entrance. This episode is probably the reason we got hyped for season 5 Stannis. What a beautiful scene it was, him and his riders holding this flaming heart banners into the forests. Secondly, Bran's reaching of the cave and meeting bloodraven and the children was an absolute great scene. ""You will fly"" the way bloodraven says this quote just sent chills down my spine. 
Then, there is the final scene. Tyrion's escape. Fucking mad. His conversation with Tywin is one of my favourites, secondly only to his with Oberyn. And then to top it off, Tywin's death scene background score is the very song made to commemorate his acts against two powerful families showing how intense he can be. Even the time Varys realises him staying back is gonna fuck him over, he just gets on the ship and fucks off. That was hilarious tbh. 

I'm not saying TWOW is bad or BOTB is bad. But this one just has to be my fav one from the show.

I heard about the acclaim of the TV show, but I wasn't really a fan of watching TV, so instead I looked to the books. While I genuinely enjoyed the plot, I couldn't get further than a third of the way through without being turned off by Martin's writing style. The amount of detail was incredible, yet it tended to make the book move too slowly, and I found that events were a little confusing to read through. 

A couple months later, I was talking to a friend and she finally convinced me to give the first episode of Game of Thrones a try, since I liked the story of the book. I was totally hooked, and about 2 months later, I was completely caught up to the end of Season 6. I loved everything about it, and it's still the only ongoing TV series I'm watching now.

So after this, I decided to give the book another try, especially after encouragement from another friend who told me the books were equally captivating once they started to pick up. I figured now that I had the full plot, things wouldn't be nearly as confusing, and I would be able to read the book a bit easier. I was right, it wasn't confused. I still had trouble getting through the pages without being bored however.

Is there any way for me to overcome this? I really want to see just how much the books diverge from the show, since people say it's like a different story altogether, yet I can't bring myself to read them.

Let's review: we first meet Yohn Royce midway through Season 4, when Petyr Baelish arrives at the Eyrie ahead of his scheduled marriage to Lysa Arryn, Sansa Stark in tow. From the beginning, Royce makes no secret of his distaste for Littlefinger, regarding him an untrustworthy character. While never explicitly stated, Royce also seems to think that Littlefinger's relatively humble origins render him an unworthy suitor for the Lady of the Vale. Following Lysa's death, Royce openly (and accurately) theorizes that Baelish killed her, but following Sansa's (false) testimony, Royce grudgingly accepts that Littlefinger probably isn't going anywhere for the foreseeable future.

Shortly thereafter, Littlefinger arranges for the now-motherless SweetRobin to be fostered by Lord Royce. Again, just a hunch, but my sense is that Littlefinger did this to appease Royce, allowing him to believe that taking SweetRobin under his wing would eventually increase his influence over the boy, though Littlefinger knew that he had so endeared himself to SweetRobin by then that he was unlikely to go against his advice.

We next see Royce in mid-Season 6, when Littlefinger arrives to visit with SweetRobin. Royce is at the ready with information he seems to think could sink Littlefinger once and for all--correctly asserting (once again) that Littlefinger had gone back on his pledge to bring Sansa Stark to safety by helping to arrange a political marriage between she and Ramsay Bolton. The Boltons are, of course, bitter enemies of House Stark, and Royce's sympathy/admiration for the Starks dates back to his youthful acquaintance with Ned Stark, who spent much of his early life being fostered at the Eyrie.

Littlefinger successfully turns this around on Royce, however, alleging that his knowledge of he and Sansa's travel plans was known to few other than Royce himself, and it was either Royce's carelessness or treachery which led them to be ambushed by Bolton forces.

This is, of course, a complete lie, and both Littlefinger and Royce know it. It's enough for SweetRobin, however, who considers executing Royce based on what Littlefinger told him. With his life quite literally hanging in the balance, Royce is forced to stand down. Baelish, now *de facto* Lord of the Vale, orders Royce to mobilize the Knights of the Vale and prepare to march north.

At the Battle of the Bastards, Royce proves himself a capable military commander, making short work of the Bolton infantry surrounding what was left of Jon's army, and effectively securing their victory over Ramsay Bolton.

As major political/military forces convene at Winterfell some time later, Royce loudly objects to the idea of the Vale joining a formal alliance with an army partially made up of Wildlings. By the end of said meeting, however, Royce joins the chorus of those declaring Jon Snow the new King in the North.

We the audience know that Jon as king is not the outcome Littlefinger was hoping for. While it's unclear if Royce realizes this as well, his decision to join the Northern lords in rallying behind Jon strikes me as being quite calculated. So long as Littlefinger maintains political control of the Vale, Royce's influence will be limited.

By contrast, Jon has yet to establish a new military/political hierarchy in his kingdom. Royce's experience and record would theoretically leave him well-positioned to assume a civilian and/or military leadership role in Jon's new government. Thereby leaving him better able to combat Baelish and his influence.

I was rewatching the scene from season 5 of GoT where Varys &amp; Tyrion are on their way to Mereen to meet with Dany. The two come across a red priestess in Volantis who is telling a small crown about how Dany, The Dragon Queen, is the savior. Throughout this, Tyrion makes comments to Varys in a condescending manner towards the priestess. Tyrion says to Varys ""We're going to meet the savior, you should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the savior?"" Immediately after he says this, the exact priestess turns her attention to him, &amp; they share a period of long, unbroken eye contact. 

I am kind of getting the impression that this may be alluding to the fact that Tyrion will be this ""savior"" as events continue to unfold. For those who want to see this scene for themselves, it is Season 5 Episode 3 &amp; starts at the 53:47 mark if you are using HBO Now.

Please let me know what you think about this, maybe Tryion is the savior, maybe he isn't. We will known soon enough.

I have an MA in Medieval History and Archaeology (though admittedly I specialise in Anglo-Saxon and Viking subjects), and I couldn't help but think that Barristan Selmy is based on Sir William. My thoughts below.

 1. Both started with poor prospects: Both Barristan and William are of noble birth. Barristan was not a firstborn son, neither was William. William's father went so far as to openly admit his son's life was worthless when King Stephen threatened to hurl the child William from an onager.

 2. Both impressed higher lords at a young age: Barristan won tournaments at age 9, and through his bravery won the favour of higher lords. William's bravery in the face of death impressed King Stephen so much that he allowed him to live as a ward to a Norman lord.

 3. Both are associated in some way with ""mad"" kings: Barristan with the clearly mad Aerys II, William with Stephen of Blois, who reportedly went/was mad during his reign.

 4. Both achieved their station by tournament prowess: Barristan was famous for his prowess in the lists, and in fact built his career on it. William, the Marshal literally made his fortune by winning tourneys and ransoming his opponents' horses and armour.

 5. Both served the Crown above all other ties: Barristan served both the Targaryen and Baratheon regimes. William got his start because of Stephen, and served the Plantagenet primogenture afterward.

 6. Both served rebel queens: Barristan and Danaerys, William and Empress Matilda.

 7. Both served successive generations of royal houses: Barristan served (to my knowledge, it may be more, very limited book knowledge) 4 kings/queens, William served 5 kings and by extension Matilda.

 8. Both are revered as the/one of the greatest knights who ever lived: Ser Barristan is renowned as quite possibly the greatest knight to ever serve the Seven Kingdoms (note, not swordsman). Sir William was described by Stephen Langton as ""the greatest knight who ever lived"" and might be the origin of that term.

 9. Both are unflaggingly loyal: Barristan admits to being disgusted by Aerys and Robert very often, but followed his oath. William was often at odds with his rulers, but served their will nonetheless.

 10. Both were crucial advisors to their rulers: Barristan served on numerous Small Councils, William literally taught the ways of war to 5 kings.

 11. Both were feared in old age: Both Barristan and William were regarded, even in old age, as one of the fiercest fighters anyone could face.

This might be totally unimportant, but it bothers me to no end. Early season 2(?), when Tyrion dismisses Janos Slynt and appoints Bronn as commander of the city watch, the two exchange these lines and i dont get it at all.

(roughly paraphrasing)

Tyrion: ""If i asked you to kill a newborn, still at their mothers breast, would you do it no questions asked?""

Bronn: ""not no questions asked. Id ask how much""

Too which i really have no idea what he means by this. How much should he kill the newborn? is he saying he needs to be paid to do this? Someone explain please",10,5,False,self,,,,,

I have always wondered how true this is. Stannis may be more of a soldier than a politician but he seems to have more of an understanding of politics than Robert did and certainly more than Joff.    

After taking Kings Landing, he would still have to deal with the starks in the north, and whatever the Iron Islands are pulling. The last thing he would want to deal with would be an army of lannisters. He would recognize sansa as a valuable trading piece (what she was to begin with) and likey most of the lannister men as useful allies.     

I think he would let Joff, Tyrion, and Cersei live in order to gain Tywin's support. Robert understood how important that was and he was a drunk idiot. Sansa would likely be kept alive in order to trade with the north, maybe for Jaime to gain more favor with Tywin and a master swordfighter back into his king's guard. ",23,6,False,self,,,,,

Personally, amidst my desperation I've been constantly estimating the number of days until the premiere, both optimistically and conservatively (optimistic = early June, conservative = early July), however I'm also constantly reminded of something. As much as I'm longing for the first episode of Season 7, considering there won't be 10 episodes I know that Season 7 will go by extremely quick. 

So we have a dilemma here. Given the choice between waiting until the summer or watching Season 7 Episode 1 tomorrow, we would all bust out our Arbor Red and watch the fuck out of 7x01 tomorrow night. But 7 weeks later the depression will kick back in. 

The point I'm trying to make is don't take these last 3-4 months of the offseason for granted. One of the beauties of the off-season is that the hype never dies. In the back of our minds we know that new episodes are coming soon, even if they will take many months. But once the season is over, the hype dies a bit. 

There are so many things we all can do to pass the time while simultaneously filling the Westeros-sized hole in our hearts. Start the books. Re-watch the show until your eyes start to hurt. My personal recommendation is to check out YouTube channels like [Blind Wave](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6nVTBxW49HljLcU_6vK4QjNLrYvYq1a7)  or [FilmBuff](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe_IwMmqzegQUt7RZfftF96AC6Wf13j4i) to watch GoT virgins go through the Westerosi journey alongside a true man of winter to guide their journey.

We are almost there guys. Only a few more months. But like I said, a few more months isn't such a bad thing if you change your perspective a bit! ",10,18,False,self,,,,,

So basically, no matter how much a body has decayed, the Night's King can restore it to life. We've seen skeletons come out of the ground wielding axes and swords, and even arms stabbing after being detached. The problem with that is, if there are no joints or ligaments or anything attaching the various body parts and putting them in motion, that means that the NK's magic isn't only holding the bones together, it is effectively swinging the axe by using the bones as a conduit for his power. An arm can't bend or extend without muscles. If that's the case, why even bother with dead bodies? Why not just send the axes and swords and even the bones flying through the air, around and around, until they're all dead?

Also, as we saw in the Hardhome massacre, the skeletons can be stopped and it would seem killed by arrows and swords and whatnot. One skeleton had its head crushed by a boot and the rest of the bones stopped moving, and another got an arrow through the eye while it was poking its head through the wall. Why would the skeleton stop moving when this happens? No central nervous system has been compromised, no essential ligament has been severed. Couldn't the pieces of smashed skull fly into the Thenn's eyes and distract him while the arm trips him up?

This is an outrageous oversight and D&amp;D should be ashamed",15,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

First the straight forward answer is easier for the general audience to understand. Secondly even if GRRM did not leave the show there is no way i could still see him fitting in this conspiracy into the show no way so i think it is for the best they left it out and simplified it in my opinion if you have a different opinion that's fine i will not judge you at all. 

But this ask the question could the show still do there own version of it. Well yes and no. No in the fact the starks already have the north back but yes in something similar to that plan could happen. I predict in season 7 Howland will come to Winterfell and reveal the truth to Jon. After this Jon will receive a Raven from Dany to insist her in the battle for KL. Jon with some bannermen, Howland and his bannermen, Davos, Ghost, and Lord Manderly and yes i said lord Manderly and his men will go to fight along side Dany. Now i think Lord Manderly will be told about Jon's parentage and both Howland and Manderly will conspire to get Jon on the iron throne.

Perhaps Varys could also help int he conspire and maybe Qyburn if the theory of him working with Varys is true. Now why would Howland want to conspire to get Jon on the iron throne. Well he knows Jon is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna so he knows Jon has a rightful claim to the throne more so then Dany. Also Howland may see Dany a threat but Howland is no idiot so he wants to come in as an ally and when the time is right strike and take Dany down and put Jon on the throne and marry Sansa (or Arya if you are one of those people) to secure a peace with the north.

Also i think Lord Manderly would help because wall he would know Jon is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna he still knows Jon has some stark blood in him. Varys would want to help because if he were to find out that Rhaegar and Lyanna had a child he would indeed want to help him get on the throne and try to make Dany look like a conquer and make Jon look like the secret savior (think a show version of his plans for Young Griff). As for Qyburn well like i said if the theory of him secretly helping Varys is true then he would also want to pitch in and help. Now do i think this is true no of course not but it is a crackpot theories and crackpot theories are always the fun ones to think about. And this is fun to think about ",10,4,False,self,,,,,

One of the ideas behind it which was thought to debunk the theory, was that it would be hard for houses of the North to convey messages in secrecy. 
Here's my .02 cents about this idea. 

Let's say the conspiracy is as old as the saying, ""The North Remembers"", the idea could be ancient, passed down through the generations, when and if he time comes, The North will remember, and restore a Stark to Winterfell. If this is the case, simply stating the credo would connect a house to this idea.

It shows the dynamic of the Stark family really well, it sets up the Lannisters as antagonists brilliantly, and most importantly sets the stage for the central mystery of the first season really well with regards to Jon Arryn's death.

I guess theres 3 summed possibilities to Varys motivations. The common idea that many people believe in is that Varys truly just wants a stable realm and believes Daenerys is the key to that, which I guess is what the show will go with. Another is that he's just a Targaryen loyalist which has too many holes because he worked against Rhaegar and may have helped Aerys II fall into madness. And then the detailed theory provided in the video that really explains everything is that he is secretly a Blackfyre supporting his own family's claim.To me, this theory makes the most sense and I believe thats where the books will go. The major problem is that the Young Griff/Aegon storyline is essential to this, and the shows simply don't have the time to create this storyline. Wouldn't it be a bummer if this theory is true about Varys, and isn't included in the shows. It would be the makeup for his entire character, and would explain every move he ever made. Would the show really rob the viewers of that? I'm not really sure what I'm getting at here but I just wanted to hear thoughts/opinions on what everyone thinks is really going on w/ show Varys in comparison with the books. Also predictions on what may happen.

The last scene cuts out of him vs Meryn Trant, but no where in the show does it say that he is dead. And knowing GRRM (looking at you Hound), there is a good possibility that he is dead, considering he wasn't killed directly in a scene.
