So most of my friends have watched the show and say it's amazing and that I should watch it too, but I'm aware of major plot events such as the red wedding and who dies during the scene, and Joffrey being poisoned and dying too. I watched the pilot with a friend tonight and thought the show was decent, but it bothers be that I know that these characters are going to die eventually and it seems pointless to get invested in their stories. It really sucks that I won't ever experience the red wedding like people that watched it when it first aired and that's the main thing that turns me away from the show, are there more scenes other than what I've listed that have you saying ""What the fuck just happened?"" and are as much of a surprise?

Speculate with me!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2ueusj/all_spoilers_i_went_through_the_new_season_5/,[deleted],1422804171,"* Jaime standing over Tywins corpse (same place Joffreys body was last season...?) This might also be possibly Cersei walking out on him. Jaime is lamenting over the consequences of his actions. He may even believe Cerseis point about his little brother Tyrion being a psychotic murderer now.
* We see an image of a group of men on horseback guiding a caravan through a field against the backdrop of a mountainous terrain. This could be anybody, but if I were to place an educated guess on this Id say in that caravan is Varys and Tyrion. My only reasons for guessing this are that, clearly, Magister Illyrio is being replaced with Varys for the the TV series. Also this image is juxtaposed between the aforementioned image of Jaime standing over Tywins body as Ceresi walks out on him and the following scene...
* ...which takes place before she walks out on him, we see Cersei chastising Jaime for letting Tyrion run free.
	*A New Season Begins...*
* We have a voiceover by Petyr saying theres no justice in this world, to Sansa, unless we make it.
* Okay I believe this might be Jon in the paddleboat arriving to speak with the Wildlings. This guess is solely based on the fact that it is snowy here. Also that pack of Wildlings from a distance looks like the ones we see later in the trailer.
* Bron drawing his sword from its scabbard. That looks cool, I cant wait to see more of him in the series.
* Okay, these marching people in masks looking like something from Kubricks *Eyes Wide Shut* are likely the Sons of the Harpy, or the TV series equivalent of them. I feel like theyre going to be less like assassins in the series and more like a terrorist group. I have more on this theory later in the trailer.
* The Sand Snakes! Im so excited to see them in the series. We have one of the Sand Snakes using a bullwhip to crack a bucket off some poor soul buried neck-deep in the sand. I feel like this is just a scene to display the brutality of the Sand Snakes. Its going to be horrific.
* Avenge them.
* Okay, so we see a group of people waddling out to rowboats in the water. I think this is people willing to join Jons cause. I could be wrong.
* Here we see a young blonde woman cutting her thumb. I think this is going to be the flashback we heard of involving Cersei and Maggie the Frog. I believe this flashback will serve as the teaser before the credits in the Season Premiere. A flashback placed anywhere else will just be jarring otherwise.
* Margery marrying Tommen. Very straightforward.
* The Wildlings, lead by the Lord of Bones, walking to meet Jon at the shore.
* We see Varys talking with Tyrion, their conversation all but confirms that Tyrions entire story from *A Dance with Dragons* is being truncated significantly. Im personally okay with this.
* Also, Tyrion falls from the crate he was shipped in, now with a full beard. How long was he in that crate? At the end of Season Four he had five oclock shadow, but then again he looks badass with that beard so Im really totally okay with it.
* The Nights Watch gathered around a pyre (to watch someone be burned at the stake?)
* Cersei looking smug.
* Varys and Tyrion walking through the slums.
* Men on horseback charging through a wooded area. I see no sigils, so not much to work with there.
* Jon looking solemn.
* Sansa in a bath.
* Two young girls walking hand-in-hand through a dark forrest. I am confident this might be part of the Cersei flashback as well.
* Some Thenns outside Castle Black.
* Im not going to start the wheel, Im going to break the wheel. Quite frankly, Im not sure what that even means, Daenerys.
* Jorah in battle with some Unsullied. This should be exciting.
	*On 4.12.15*
* Cersei opens a gift from the Sand Snakes. Clearly they arent happy with the outcome of the trail by combat either.
* Tyrion outside what I believe to be a brothel in the slums where he is founded by a certain someone, bookreaders might know what I am referring to.
* Cersei saying something paranoid and misguided to Jaime, still from the scene between the two beside Tywins corpse.
	*Justice*
* Melisandre lighting that pyre we saw earlier. I cant express enough how much I hope that isnt our favorite stubborn Master at Arms, Alliser Thorne.
* I dont think Im ready for what I deserve, said Tyrion as he takes a drink looking like a total boss.
	*Has a price*
* With me! Jon championed leading the Nights Watch, I do believe.
* We see a brief battle between what might be the Nights Watch against... something? The scene cuts out before were given a chance to see who theyre fighting. But I suspect it will be Thenns, based on some of the things we see in this trailer.
* We see Jaime in Donrish garb. Being escorted by some guards (as evident by the spear).
* We see an attractive woman in little dress, so clearly some nudity courtesy of HBO. This might be part of the brothel scene I mentioned earlier.
* We see the Nights Watch lift being raised.
* Theyll never even find whats left of you, said Olenna, the coolest grandma in all of Westeros.
* We see a Nights Watchmen (likely Jon) fighting somebody in furs doing sick flips. This has to be a Thenn based on what weve seen of their fighting style last year.
* We see who I suspect to be Jaime taking a fall during a battle against somebody in Dornish garb.
* We see a Son of the Harpy beside Kill the Masters written conveniently in English on the wall.
* We see Theon looking traumatized, promising there will be more disturbing Reek scenes to come. (PSA: Ramsay is the literal worst.)
* We see Bronn battling two Dornishmen on horseback! Holy shit, I cant wait for this! Oh my God.
* We see people in dark robes smashing barrels of wine? Im not sure why this is happening.
* We see Arya from a distance arriving at the House of Black and White.
* We see the Cat of of the Canals.
	*Game of Thrones*
* We some of the House Arryn men riding on horseback toward some hills.
* We see a board reminiscent of both Robbs and Stannis with a map of Westeros and some chess piece like house sigils. Lots of Bolton sigils. (PSA: Boltons are like literally the worst.)
* Again we return to the conversation between Varys and Tyrion, ensuring that Tyrions book five story is truncated significantly.
* We see Daenerys again, looking beautiful in some torchlight.
* Then we all collective giggle excitedly as Drogon blows our fucking minds.
* More of the paddle boats picking up some people, I suspect this is Nights Watchmen and Wildlings.
* Okay! Heres a brief .5 second clip that I suspect is a huge spoiler. Missandei is kissing Greyworm, and he looks more stoic than usual. I think he might be dead, and he died in that gladiator combat we saw earlier against Jorah. This is obviously unconfirmed speculation, but thats what it looks like to me.
* We see some people watching a guy get beaten by an armored man.
* Melisandre is showing us more of her plot once again, nobody is complaining.
* Unsullied marching alongside Daenerys, Barristan, and Dario Naharis.
* We see a wideshot of a desert terrain where I suspect that is Jaime and Bron standing before the Dornishmen they ultimately battle.
* We see a woman with spears aimed at her, I suspect she is a Sand Snake.
* We see a hand clutching the side of something, and given the spooky lighting and the dark (I suspect dirty) sleeve on the arm, I think this might be poor Theon again.
* We see a Thenn with a battle axe, poised to fight.
* Horses running around an inn with men in saddle.
* Sons of the Harpy burning things. This is what I meant by terrorist actions rather than simply assassinations.
* Margery on her knees with Tommens arm around her. She is clearly distraught, by what I dont know for sure. Perhaps she is about to be... well, bookreaders you know what it could be.
* The Unsullied, Barristan, and Dario surrounding Messandei and Daenerys. On the outskirts are Mareenise.
* A crow landing on bloody remains.
* The Harpy being torn down. Falling and falling into darkness and crashing.
	*4.12.15*
	*HBO*
	*See this trailer in IMAX.*

Now i know that in the books, LSH does not have much background story, but maybe they are adding more context in the show? Maybe she is able to speak well in the show?

I am just wondering if anyone had to read ASOIAF more than once to pick up on the other hidden secrets Martin has left behind (Bran's vision after he fell from the tower/ Jon's parents/The prophecy of Azor Ahai etc.)

Also does everyone just reread the series when Martin gives a date for his next book?

I'm just also fucking overjoyed that I'm finally done all 5 and can now just kick back and wait until Season 4/book 6 comes out......I just find Martin's writing style bounces back and forth from incredibly awesome to making me want to gouge my heart out with a spoon.......

And, frankly, it is a real possibility. Would this be part of a contract? It seems outlandish to have a clause like this in a child actors contract. Do they ignore the possibility until the actor reaches eighteen years old and then approach them on the subject? That seems a bit like an ambush.

* Tormund's eyes are blue.
* Braavos galley has pink sails.
* Shae had quite sharp fingernails and has added scars to Tyrion's face and neck.
* Meera killed Jojen, and the last fireball of the Child destroyed his body.
* Three-eyed raven might be actually three-eyed; it seems like his left eye didn't move, so he might still be blind on one eye (as he is supposed to be).
* Cersei has a scar on the upper lip, and her lower front teeth are crooked.
* Mance's moonshine drink is white as milk.
* Summer is not grey as in books, it is white-brown.
* Ygritte's funeral pyre was under the weirwood tree.
* Another weirwood tree, the one that Bran and Jojen see, actually has a face on it. It was impossible to see it on the TV screen.

Admittedly I had read the books a while back now and may have missed some points, and it was clear there were differing ranks of the creatures. But I had assumed it was more akin to LOTR's Ork and Urukai.

HBO's making a serious effort to connect with the online fan community.  They've set up that website to allow artists to show off their creative work with the other GOT-inspired submissions.  This is a quote from HBO:

&gt; The Game of Thrones Compendium site is an official, creative space for fans of the HBO series to showcase their passion for the show. All fan submissions will be viewed by the Council and their favorites will be curated into a printed compendium. If your piece is included you will receive a copy of the book. It will not be for sale.

All submissions will remain on display at the website.  The pieces selected as the ""best"" in the Compendium are going to be published in a print book and given to those winners.  I suspect HBO will also use the print book as a special gift similar to [other creative promotions they've done in the past](http://scentmarketingdigest.com/2011/03/24/hbo-spends-a-bundle-on-scent-kit-to-promote-game-of-thrones/).   So if you know anyone who might be interested in the extra recognition/fame, they ought to [check it out](https://www.gameofthronescompendium.com/).

Why are there so many ASOIAF-themed  ____powers games?""***

[This is how it started.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/263sf9/no_spoilers_meta_i_did_a_thing_rwesterospowers/) These games, which are inspired by the original /r/worldpowers, usually have a shelf-life, and rather than erase all the great stories written by the players, moderators usually work on a new subreddit, with a new take on the previous iteration. 
Most of the time  it happens because these are always a work in progress, and it's hard to find the right balance between purely role-playing experiences and rule-cramming as in complex tabletop RPGs.  
This is what led us to /r/woiafpowers. Our main goal was to find the right balance, and also create a long-lasting game which can eventually expand to as many lands in the Known World as possible. This includes the Night's Watch and the Free Folk, which were always left out of previous games.

***""And what makes this game different than the rest?""***

[**Our detailed lore and setting**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_IFXENof-mhh49-D5-K20rWPnzVKZkVGSXuo9CEKYY/edit) set the stage for roleplay and interaction between houses, by outlining rivalries, past historical occurrences from prior to the game and during it. The setting also outlines important details such as regional currencies, roads and laws.  
[**Our mechanics**](http://www.reddit.com/r/woiafpowers/wiki/gamerules#wiki_mechanics) are more detailed than any of the games predecessors, as we have adopted battle mechanics from Paizos Pathfinder and have created our own mechanics where possible. These new, detailed mechanics allow the players to have a more thorough and fulfilling experience of the game.  

[**Our rules are strict, but fair**](http://www.reddit.com/r/woiafpowers/wiki/gamerules#wiki_official_current_game_rules). We have rules that allow for all players to enjoy the game equally and fully. Although our rules may be strict, they are there for a reason and we ask that they are respected. They prevent metagaming, promote good sportsmanship and ensure a semi-realistic and friendly enviroment in the universe created by GRRM.

###[World of Ice and Fire Powers](http://www.reddit.com/r/woiafpowers)

The world of George R. R. Martin is a wide and diverse one. The story that is the subject of the Song of Ice and Fire novels is interesting and has a lengthy history.  In the long gaps in between novels and seasons, many of us turn to re-reading the books, re-watching the show, browsing and thinking up theories, perhaps even reading through the wiki.  Alongside these, there is an active outlet for interest in the world of ice and fire.World of Ice and Fire Powers is a subreddit  in which players have the opportunity to roleplay as lords, ladies, kings, sworn members of the Nights Watch, free folk, and more!  It is based on the individual development of characters by users through written lore, wikis, events and the interaction between players both diplomatically and militarily.  

WOIAFPowers is set before the War of Conquest, when Westeros still had the Seven Kingdoms and Aegon hadn't been born yet. For a taste of recent events in the game: while the King of the Rock fought to weaken the ironborn and place a king in the Riverlands, several castles and lands in the Westerlands were sacked and raided by reavers from the Iron Islands, and eventually King Arrec Durrandon of the Stormlands took control over the Riverlands and appointed Blackwood as a Lord Paramount. Bear Island was taken by Lord Greyjoy, but the King in the North himself rode to battle and defeated the ironborn.

In context of the role-playing, the game is thick with political, military, and diplomatic conspiracy and detail and rooted in the creativity and free-writing of the players.  In addition, the game has several elements from the Pathfinder RPG, free form role-playing and original mechanics which provide a structure that allows the game to be enjoyable and organized.  
Out of the context of the role-playing, the community is very friendly and active. If you have any questions or want to know more about the game before joining, [check our Slack channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/woiafpowers/comments/2t4usu/mod_post_a_new_form_of_chat/) and feel free to ask.
[The rules can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/woiafpowers/wiki/gamerules) and we look forward to new players.  Our Westeros is constantly shifting and evolving, and with every new player, the plot thickens.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

Hi,

|
:--
|

My wife and I loved nearly everything about GoT. And we're excited about the launch of the new Living Card Game in August by Fantasy Flight Games. But we had trouble following the story and the characters.

|
:--
|

We would love to give it another shot but don't want to make the same mistake. Perhaps we need a short supplement for each episode? Nothing too long but something that lists significant advancements in the plot?

|

|

Any help would be appreciated! Help make fans out of us!

Sincerely,
Justin

&gt;Does she? This season seems more about her using or ignoring him. Maybe I should tag the rest of the season...
As for the symbolism, I would say that it's a bit ironic that gold, the thing that makes Lannisters special, is a useless replacement for his real talent. So, the thing that makes Lannisters worth anything cannot help the prodigal Lannister son. All the Lannister gold in the world can do nothing to help them.

As a moderator on /r/IronThronePowers , I'd like to invite folks to check out our roleplaying game- a community of writers, schemers, and risk-takers shaping an alternate-universe Westeros. Play the game of thrones for yourself- or fall from favor in the process.

Come claim a holdfast or character and jump into what's going to be an exciting game- and a chance to see how the past of the series might've played out had certain choices been made differently. The game is set in 276 AC, prior to the series and before the Defiance of Duskendale, when King Aerys was taken captive by Lord Darklyn- and when he truly crossed the line into becoming consumed by paranoia as the Mad King.

As a game set pre-rebellion, lots of exciting factors could change how the future of the realm progresses: Rhaegar's choice of a bride, the efforts of Quellon Greyjoy to bring the Iron Islands closer to the rest of Westeros, and the possible southern ambitions of Rickard Stark. Above it all is King Aerys II- a figure already notorious as a neglectful and weak king, but still with a chance of redeeming himself.

Tonight, applications are still on-going for houses and can be found in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThronePowers/comments/2uxtyc/mod_post_applications_for_normal_lords/). Tomorrow, claims will be open first-come, first-serve for remaining houses as well as characters from across the realm. Two main options exist: claim as an entire house, controlling its holding's resources and troops as well as the members of its family, or claim as a single individual- an unlanded adventurer, a wandering hedge knight, a citizen of King's Landing, even a member of a Great House (provided the main player of that claim agrees!).

If you're a fan of Crusader Kings II, think of this as a text-based version of the game- scheming with other noble players, revolting against pesky lieges, and even sending assassins after those who wrong you. We're happy to welcome roleplayers with plenty of experience, as well as people who have never tried roleplaying before! ",0,12,False,self,,,,,

Lyrics: http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/murderbydeath/nooathnospell.html

My first thoughts:

**An old crow spoke to me, Must have lain limp, down the street. Said we're both tied to our own trees, Cut me loose, cut me loose.**

A possible allusion to Bran's journey.


**Little beast, are you wild as me? Left some teeth in your enemies**

A reference to the Wargs of the show


**We won't be broken. There's no curse we haven't spoken. There is no oath, there is no spell, to deliver us, so help. Cut me loose, I wish you well. No oath, no spell. No prayer, no hell but the one we made.**

Pretty damn bleak, but not by GoT standards. Everyone is Westrose pledges to some oath or some god, but few receive any actual help or solace from it. 


Thoughts?

Let's not pay for a subscription until they prove that it won't.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2vc0uu/no_spoilers_lets_face_it_hbo_go_will_crash_the/,HarveyJYogscast,1423511956,"Look, we all celebrated when it was announced that HBO will be allowing non-cable subscribers to stream from HBO Go for a monthly fee. It's great that they're finally getting with the times, but that's just a start: it also has to work as intended. HBO Go has [consistently](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/10/hbo-go-true-detective-finale-online-crash), [on several occasions](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-crashes-hbo-go-694035), crashed due to their servers not being able to handle the demand. Do we honestly think this is going to get better when they open the floodgates to potentially millions of new users?

Seriously, this whole situation baffles me. Has Netflix ever had a mass crash when a new season of House of Cards is released (or those pesky torrent sites, for that matter)? None that I know of. If HBO wants to compete with them, they need to show us that they're at least as good as them. Why should we blindly pay for a service that is more than likely to fail? 

I know someone is going to accuse me of being ""entitled"" (whatever that means) for complaining about a website crashing, but tell me why we should put up with this. If you knew there was an overwhelming chance that the projector at a movie theater would break down for an opening day screening, would you purchase a ticket?

Just like how Youtuber TotalBiscuit has been urging people to not pre-order games and then complain about how they're broken and full of bugs, let's all swear a solemn vow to *not* sign up for HBO Go at the time of its launch. Let's see how the premiere goes, *and then* we'll consider paying our hard-earned money for this service.

I'm saying this because after watching shows like *House of Cards* or *Breaking Bad* on netflix, I feel like I enjoy the show a lot more when I watch episodes continuously. I watched seasons 1-3 of *Game of Thrones* over a week and a half in May 2013, and I absolutely loved everything about it. But when season 4 came out, as excited as I was, I didn't enjoy it as much, not because it was worse in any way from the previous seasons, but because I watched it in 1 hour segments over the course of two months.

It felt kind of like watching a movie where you had to stop every half hour and then wait a day before resuming it. It sort of disjars you from the story when you watch it like that.

I'm just wondering if anyone else is thinking of waiting til June to watch everything, so I know I'm not the only one avoiding the entire internet to prevent spoilers. I also know it's very far fetched to assume HBO would change anything^^since ^^the ^^current ^^formula ^^works it's just a dream I wish could be realized.

While that scene was both thrilling and horrifying at the same time, what purpose did it serve exactly? Robb was one of the few likeable characters left in the show, with his pursuit of the throne and the guarantee of vengeance when he got there. Not only would I like to have seen Stannis and him battle it out for the throne, but I was actually dreaming of the death of Wreak. I understand now it furthers and deepens the story for Ariya however, which I do like. 

I also want to say that I  cannot believe the way Joffrey died.  The whole scene I thought somebody was going to save him to be killed at another point in the show. A much darker, more satisfying and gruesome death. I wanted to see the blood gleaming on the spikes where his head would be placed firmly under King Robb's rule. Perhaps some genital mutilation as well?

758,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-2-13,2015,2,13,8,2vpe5i,self.gameofthrones,[TV] [Theory] The Seven,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2vpe5i/tv_theory_the_seven/,wilbo_baggins,1423783018,"My friend and I have a theory about the ending/overall story arc that is based around the theology of Westeros. I've only seen the shows, and he has read the first 2 books, just to let you know our basis for projection. 

It seems like the ultimate battle that is building is between R'hollor (The Lord of Light) and the Other. The theory starts with the idea that R'hollor is the agent of FIRE (with Dragons and flaming swords on his side) and the Other as ICE (with white walkers/corpses and winter as his weapons).

Whatever that battle looks like, I believe that ""The Seven"" are human characters who unite or fight for Westeros against the forces of the Other - perhaps something that happened thousands of years ago and became lore/religion and is fated to happen again. Dragon glass, the only thing that can kill the walkers, will be the a key element and can only be created with the aide of Denearys's Dragons, following the ICE/FIRE theme. 

The seven are listed as:

-The Father 

-The Mother

-The Warrior

-The Maiden

-The Smith

-The Stranger

Thinking about characters in the series who could fulfill these roles, an interesting list comes together. Starting with the easy ones, you have:

The Smith = Gandry

The Stranger = Arya

The Warrior = Jon Snow

The Mother = Deneary's

Gandry is a character who will ""make kings raise and fall"" - making me think he will have a substantial role. The fact that he's a smith makes it obvious. Arya seems to be well on her way to becoming a faceless assassin, an pretty strong trait one would imagine a mythical ""stranger"" would have. Jon Snow has been protecting the realm the entire time. The less obvious ones:
 
The Father = Stannis

The Maiden = Sansa

The Crone = Bran

Stannis fathered the shadow creature and looks seems like the most rightful/likely candidate to ultimately sit on the Iron Thone (other than Deneary's). He is also a just man who serves the Lord of Light. And while I think that Jon Snow will eventually end up with Deneary's due to the ICE/FIRE theme,  I don't necessarily think the mythical Mother/Father need to be together. Sansa is still a virgin, and it seems likely that she will stay that way, making her the Maiden.

The theory kinda falls apart with Bran as the Crone - I had always interpreted ""crone"" as more of a ""Seer"" than an old lady, which made me think Bran was a perfect fit, but if the Crone needs to be female, I'm not so sure, and cannot think of another character who could fit the role (maybe Olenna Tyrell? Cerci?). One way or another, though, Bran is going to be involved, because him wogging into a Dragon seems like it needs to happen. 

Anyway, its not perfect, and has its holes, but I would be interested to hear what you all thought about it.

So the following is what I recall at the moment. Please tell me there's way more stuff than this coming in S5, as I fear I've been spoiled for all the major plot points to come:

[TV spoilers](#s ""Arya is blinded temporarily at the House of Black and White.
"")

[TV spoilers](#s ""Catelyn is resurrected by The Brotherhood? Or something."")

[TV spoilers](#s ""There is another Targaryen alive. Aemon. The kid we thought was smashed against the wall by Clegane."")

Is there more to this season than the above points? Any more huge crazy plot points to come, or have I just waited 3/4 of a year for nothing? :(

For TV series it must be in season 1, in movies before the midway point, and in books about 10% through the whole story. Ned is clearly the main by any measure, so I guess there is an element of character development to consider too.

The only other example I can think of is the girl from Psycho. There are countless main characters who die, but I want to know if Ned was the quickest.

I have more HBO shows I watch than just. GOT but the rest I could be patient to wait for DVD releases but not GOT. I have to be able to watch each new episode as it comes out. I am not too computer savy so I'd rather not pirate it, especially since I don't know how. I don't mind paying for episodes but I've searched and it doesn't seem like amazon or iTunes or anywhere else gets the new episodes. I've also read that HBO plans to sell HBOgo subscriptions separately sometime this year. That would be perfect for me but I wonder if there has been any news about if they will make it available before season 5 of GOT starts or if you guys think it will be likely they will make it available by the time the new season starts.

(You know, the scene where they're all climbing the wall of ice and some of them slip after a huge chunk splits off due to a crack, and the warg almost cuts Ygrette and Jon loose?) and afterwords they end up in some green terrace with Ygrette asking Jon: ""How long till we reach the wall?"" What confuses me is, didnt they just climb it? How come they didnt show up at Castle Black/The Shadow Tower or even East Watch? They just climbed the wall and now they're asking about it again? Are there multiple walls? Layers of walls throughout the North? Or perhaps they did climb the wall but are super west/east of Castle Black? Idk, it confuses the Seven Hells out of me and I can't make sense of it. Why is the land so fertile and green if they're that far North ya know? Perhaps one of you lot can clear this up for me as I've got no idea whats going on there....

Also please please please I'm begging you, dont be a troll and drop some spoilers from the books, GoT is my favorite show of all time and I love being suprised by the random/gruesome events/deaths of characters, for some reason fans cant seem to keep themselves from dropping spoilers on the interwebs no matter what, dont be a cunt and ruin this for me or anyone reading this post. Many many thanks to anyone who can actually answer my question tho!!!!  :D

I heard most people saying AFFC is boring and that it's a pain to get through, but although nothing has really happened so far I'm still really enjoying it, I think it's much better than AGOT and ACOK and maybe ASOS part 1 (not part 2 though). I understand a lot of the hate comes from the fact that characters like Jon, Tyrion and Dany aren't in it, but I think Sam's chapters are fun, Sansa's chapters have actually become good, and I've only read one Arya chapter so far but she's still a good POV character.

So far in my opinion the most enjoyable book I've read in ASOIAF, why is there all the hate towards it, it's not that bad? 

Edit: About 600 pages in now, less than 200 left, so far barely anything's happened! I was fine with that 200 pages in because it makes sense that early on but now I'm close to finishing and it's annoying me how little plot progression there is going on.

 -House of Stannis dies because they do not grow food.

 -House Arryn could survive, im 50/50 because the Vale will get super cold.

 -House Martell are in desert and stuff so they survive.

 -House Stark may survive because Arya is in Essos and Sansa has Littlefinger.

- House Lannister is hard to say, if the Tyrells keep backing them they will live.
 
-House Tyrell will because of the amount of food they have.

-House Bolton is hard to say, they are far north but I think they will.
 
-House Targaryen will survive, unless Danerys is killed which I feel may happen.
 
-House Baratheon/Lannister (Tommen) will if they are supplied by the Tyrells.

I personally think the Tyrells will become a huge power player because of the amount of food they have

I HAVE NO READ THE LATER BOOKS SO PLEASE DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SPOILED FOR SEASON 5!!!

So Bran is not in this season. Just completely gone from the world for an entire season. 

Is this because they rushed his story? At least, I'm guessing they rushed his story because, well.. It seems rushed I guess? 

How do you guys feel about this because where they left us with Bran, was pretty exciting and seems to have a major, major role in the world. But.. They're just gonna stop it there for a season (2 years if you go from season 4 finale)... That's kinda frustrating right?

I don't know where I was going with this post but I had to share my jumbled up thoughts about the matter because it seems weird to me that they're dropping a main character for a season and plan on just bringing him back up the season after. Like how will they fill that in, all this time has passed and now he's just done his training? I don't know.. 

Love to hear your thoughts on this but like I shouted at the start, I'm only about 100 pages into ACOK so if you can hold back on anything that may ruin my experience I'd appreciate that but if it is just some small details that would help me understand this I'd be grateful.",9,3,False,self,,,,,

I don't really fall under this category, as I've read all 5 books within the past calendar year, so this is the first time that I have actually been waiting for a book to come out.  It seems, however, that this is a unique time: the TV show is finally catching up/caught up to the books.  I've been conflicted with this notion since I finished AFFC, but it wasn't until I saw the ""Book readers are going to be upset"" article that I finally feel confident in saying: GRRM is giving a big ""Fuck you"" to his most loyal fans who have been with the series the longest.  

Think about a person who has been with the series since its inception:  This person has waited 20 years for their favorite story to be spoiled by a television show that they may or may not even watch.  I personally think it doesn't do the books justice, but that's just my extremely biased opinion.  This person waited 10 years between ASOS and ADWD for Tyrion's story to continue while the show-watchers don't even have to wait a year between Seasons 4 and 5.  

I've seen some book watchers say they won't watch this coming season, but is it really realistic for devoted book-readers to remain ignorant to the events of the show?  Before I even watched a single episode or read a single page, I knew the climax of AGOT and the details of the Red Wedding from excited/shocked show watchers.  I don't hold any grudges, but it's basically sealed the fact that I'll have to watch this season to avoid being spoiled by those who have already watched it.

I'm sure this comes off as a rant, but I have to ask book-readers: How does this make you feel?  To me, it seems like a big ""fuck you"" from GRRM to his most loyal fans.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm looking too much into it. But, even as someone who has just picked up the books this year, I still feel a little betrayed.  I would like some opinions of book-readers who agree or disagree with my sentiment, because this has been bothering me more than I am willing to admit.

The only word that comes to mind after reading through what was supposed to be a joyous occasion.  A King has wronged his people, and he sets out to make things right once more.

But things won't be right. Never again.

I'm primarily a show watcher, so suffice to say, I knew it was coming.  Reading through *A Game of Thrones*, *A Clash of Kings* and now *A Storm of Swords*, I keep thinking that maybe, just maybe, things will turn out differently.  However, leading up to Wedding, the signs were all there.  

 
&gt; Catelyn repeatedly asking herself if Robb will be safe.  

&gt; The Hound repeatedly telling Arya that they need to get to the *bloody wedding.*

&gt; Roose preparing to get loose.

I may have reacted harder to hearing Grey Wind's cries. I may have reacted harder to Robb calling out for his mother. Perhaps it was the futility of Arya being *this* close to her family once more.  After I first watched *S3, E9: The Rains of Castamere*, I stared, slack-jawed, at the ending credits, silent like the hopes of the Stark family. I promptly stormed away, swearing off this show forever, betrayed by a sense of comfort and security.

Needless to say, I came crawling back, hungry for more.  Which lead me to start reading the books, which lead me to **this damn chapter**.

I believe there's a new subreddit for me to start following, /r/halfwaythroughasos/. 

**TL;DR** THEY HAD GUEST RIGHT, C'MON MAN

George Martin has been a [huge supporter](http://grrm.livejournal.com/353777.html) of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in New Mexico, and has asked his fans on several occasions to support their cause. They rescue and home captive raised and bred wolves and wolf-dogs who would otherwise be stuck in terrible situations. Donations from GRRM and from the fans have provided much needed assistance for the sanctuary in the past, and what better way to pass time waiting for the next book/season than helpy to get reddit involved in supporting this wolfy cause.

**Excerpt from the Wlld Spirit Wolf Santuary [About Page](http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/about.php):**
&gt;The Sanctuary houses over sixty captive-bred wolves and wolf-dogs, most of who were rescued from abusive or neglectful situations. Since the animals were raised in a captive situation, they do not possess the skills necessary to survive in the wild and cannot be released. We offer lifelong care to all of our residents.

&gt;We strive to create the best environment possible for our animals. The Sanctuary is located in the high-desert mountains of western New Mexico providing plenty of trees and hills for our animals to explore in enclosures ranging from 5000 square feet to one acre. All of our wolves and wolf-dogs are offered only the best diet, vitamin supplementation, and medical care available.

**Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary's Mission Statement:**

*Rescue*

&gt;Rescue displaced, unwanted, and un-releasable captive-bred wolves, wolf-dogs, and other related species.

*Sanctuary*

&gt;Provide permanent, lifetime safe sanctuary for those that we rescue and provide the highest level of care, enrichment and habitat.

*Education*

&gt;Educate the public about wolves, wolf-dogs, and other related species, our eco system and how we all play a part in it, and the excellent, ethical care and treatment of all animals domestic and wild.

I've noticed at least one problem with the depiction of metalworking in the show.  Firstly, the show uses melted wax as the stand-in for molten gold in a certain key scene.  However, if I'm not mistaken, molten gold (&gt;1000 deg C) should give off a noticeable orange glow.  The producers could have easily added the glow in postproduction.  Was this just an oversight, or am I mistaken in my facts?

A second possible problem, which is present in both the show and the books, involves the melting of a Valarian steel sword and recasting it into two new implements of destruction. However, making excellent sword steel involves more than just the alloy composition of the ingot, but also includes extensive processing after the initial ingot had been poured.  This includes annealing, folding, recrystalization, quenching, etc.  The exact techniques applied must have been part of the Valarians' lost process for producing their wonderful steel.  

Perhaps someone with more knowledge of metallurgy than I can comment.",10,3,False,self,,,,,

Will it become available in store?

Does ""sold out online"" mean that they will no longer carry it?

Are there any other trusted sites to buy it from and not spend double the price for it?

Any help would be much appreciated. 

I have emailed Best Buy, but haven't got a response yet. I will update in case anyone is interested.

I like Margaery so I chose to stay loyal to her and not forge the letter. If she were to find out I'd betrayed her trust then it'd probably ruin the chances of her helping me in future episodes.

**Kiss Whitehill's ring or refuse?**

I didn't kiss his ring because in a time like this House Forrester and Rodrick needed to look strong. Also Elaena Glenmore was there and I didn't want to look weak in front of my future wife.

***Speaking of Elaena Glenmore...***

I did get engaged to her (proving I didn't need to forge the letter as Mira), by offering half of House Forrester's Ironwood. I'm currently unsure if that was a bad choice, but at least this way I can count on the support of her father's men.

**Help Cotter or don't?**

I defended Cotter. This is the choice I'm most unsure about. Looking back I kinda think maybe I shoulda stayed out of it.

**Kill Mira's attacker?**

Chose to kill the attacker. One reason being I should help the kid who just saved me and also he might be a useful ally later in the game. Also, if I don't kill the attacker, he might try to kill me again later.

Truman; an action that ended a war. Truman has held that: ""... I have no regrets and, under the same circumstances, I would do it again."" His rationale? The bombings killed at least 129,000; they saved, indirectly, up to 500,000 American soldier casualties. If we scale that number by the ratio of military losses per belligerent (about 21:4, or 5.2), that equates to roughly 2,500,000 Japanese military casualties avoided. That's 3 million, against 129,000.

The Red Wedding in Season 3 of Game of Thrones is regarded as one of the most brutal and shocking TV moments in history, and it was ordered by Tywin Lannister, a commander in the War of the Five Kings. In the aftermath of the Wedding (3.10 Mhysa), in a scene adapting a second act conversation between Tywin and Tyrion Lannister in ASOS, Tywin says the following of the Red Wedding:

**""Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.""**

Tyrion never gives him a real answer.

Whatever your opinion of Tywin Lannister -- and there are surely many -- he seems to demonstrate here a regard for human life; even while he sends smallfolk from the Westerlands to die in combat against the forces of the North, he expresses some desire to save whom he can, and his statement suggests that he even would like to save some of the people he is fighting against. In fact, he uses the same ""logic"" in his justification of the murder of Robb Stark, Catelyn, and the Northern retainers that real leaders in world history have used to justify their own destructive and morally dubious methods, President Truman only being a most extreme example. 

We're on unstable moral ground here. This is something I thought quite a bit about this morning, and I wanted to hear your opinions. Tyrion, always quick-witted and sympathetic, does not have an answer for his father Tywin Lannister, no retort of any kind, no condemnation. I'm not sure if I have one, either. Do you?

**TL;DR Tywin offers a defense of the infamous Red Wedding. Is he justified?**

I am pretty sure it is not rains of castamere,  I know the song's music

Wait ,you could be referring to the musician who sings it
. I am referring to the music( just the music,  no singing)

The moment when it plays, is right after cersei tells pycelle to give food to the dogs and before Jaime tells Loras he won't marrying cersei

And this song is very pleasant to hear, you could say,

I had this cool idea to basically have a tournament, where we can vote and discuss who would be the best fighter in Game of Thrones. I've only seen the show so far so please keep it book spoiler free. This could be a huge tournament, probably 128 contenders, I was thinking about a bunch of people including: Jaime, Ned, Arya, Thoros de Myr, Stannis, Robert Baratheon, The Hound, The Mountain, Khal Drogo, Anguy, Beric, Oberyn, Robb, Jon, Half-hand, Grey Worm, Jorah, Ser Barristin, Ygritte, Mance, Styr, Tormund, basically anyone whose held a weapon would be in it. Even the little piece of shit Joffrey could be there. I think that this'll be a fun way to see who actually is the best fighter. Anyways, if anyone knows how to create this tournament, including a post of who can contend, I'd greatly appreciate it, because I have no clue, just the idea behind it. 
Thanks so much!


This is what I have so far, I think I'll use the site jking124 suggested to me via pm. Please tell me who to add, and who to take out, I had to go through a bunch of character pages. Also if you don't know a character please look them up before deciding. Thank you!

I hate the over the top drama leading up to character deaths in other shows with cliche saying and stupid music (twd). Westeros seems to me like a world where shit happens and not everyone gets an epic death with a legacy to go along with it.

I'm a huge fan of everything about Game of Thrones, I've watched all seasons at least twice, I've read the first three books and I've played the first two episodes of the Telltale game. I really want to read the remaining books but my friend has forbidden me to do so, so that I can't spoil anything for him when we discuss the latest episode.

So my problem is that I need more of Westeros, but I can't read the books, and I've already read The world of ice and fire, and the other games doesn't seem to be any good. And that's why I'm writing here, do you guys have any sugestion on what can give me more Game of thrones?

Thanks in advance! :)",16,6,False,self,,,,,

I hope I'm posting in the right sub; I read the FAQ, the rules, and perused the other subs, but this seems the most relevant to my query. If this *isn't* the right place, please let me know and I'll move this post elsewhere!


Long story short, I am planning a surprise party for my baby sister, and want it to be Game of Thrones themed. We're both massive fans of the books and the show, and my sister's joking-but-not-really dream is to ""grow up"" to be a Khaleesi (she's turning 21).


At this point, I've found drink recipes, food options, and a gorgeous party dress and necklace that are reminiscent of Daenery's outfit in Astapor for the Birthday Khaleesi to wear. What I'm stuck on, however, is what to *do* during the party. This is being hosted in a family home, as the birthday girl won't officially be 21 yet, so I'd like to think of activities or games for her and her friends.


Beer pong is an obvious choice, and if everyone shows interest in watching a couple episodes, that would also work. I'm tempted to put together something similar to the House Cup like in Harry Potter, where everyone is grouped in a house and earns points/allegiance throughout the night through various activities/actions, and whichever individual has the most points at any given time is the King of the Seven Kingdoms...meaning that people can vie for the crown.


Anyways, Reddit tends to have amazing ideas that I would never dream of, so if anyone here has suggestions, I am all ears!

**TL;DR:** I'm planning a surprise birthday party for my little sister, but am no longer ""with it"" and need to know of a fun game that would be suitable/fun for a 21st birthday party. Any ideas appreciated!",14,8,False,self,,,,,

It goes hand in hand with our own world and our own histories.

But, as you read you find some pretty damn good evidence that these Gods are in fact real. 

I am convinced that R'hllor is real and very powerful. Time and time again his powers have been proven. If there is a singular reason for the red comet, it almost certainly came from R'hllor. At least, that's the way I see it.

The Seven have sort of proven they could be real... I mean, the things the Faceless men can do with disguising themselves is bordering on the divine...if not flat out miraculous. There's also the possible communication they, or one of ''them'' had with Ser Davos after the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Other than that, I'm not sure of any other evidence of their existence. I'm not convinced they are real, but the FM certainly make me hold judgement.

The Drowned God...I have no idea. other than a few men being able to perform a crude version of CPR, I see no other evidence that he is, or ever had been real. Maybe I missed something?

:edit: - Can't believe I forgot to to mention the Old Gods. Not sure if the Children are the Gods, or maybe some sort of Demi-God or if maybe the the Three Eyed Raven is some sort of Demi-God. Either way, They absolutely exist and are powerful.

I don't know, what do you think? Are any of them real?...Maybe all of them?

Also, what do you interpret to be the true meaning of the red comet, and if it was divine will, who's will was it?",23,2,False,self,,,,,

You guys have been waiting on this book for years now right? and it's still a year or 2 away... This book is  hopefully going to be around 900-1000 pages. Depending on how fast you read, that book can last you a few days or a few weeks. But then it's done with and you are going to have to wait another few years (hopefully not as long).

With knowing this I have to ask how you guys will deal with it. Will you pick it up and read through the last book again before reading it. Binge read and just consume it over a week (if you even could?) or will you steady it out, savoring it by doing maybe a chapter a day, 2 day, 100 pages a week maybe?.. I don't know, I've never been that into a series to be big on it's launch date and seeing as I'm 300 pages into ACOK I'm going to be waiting for WoW with the rest of you although I have no plan for it. I guess I'd like to steady it out but lets be honest.. It's kinda hard to put this book down once you start. ",21,5,False,self,,,,,

But Varys was the one who sent the poison for her in season 1.  If it wasn't actually poison wine the trader wouldn't have been hesitant to drink it.  Varys had no way of knowing that Jorah would stop the whole thing from happening either, so it looks like he's directly implicated in this.  At any rate, he'll have a hard time convincing dany he's on her side after sitting on the small council so long.

What if the show is going to take a huge turn from the books, and the ""who said anything about him"" might actually be Myrcella.  We know the story is shifting to Dorne anyway.  She's Tyrion's niece, and Varys helped him escape after he was befriended by Oberyn.

I'm tempted to get some episodes of the show but at 2.50 each it wouldn't take long to eat into the credit, and whilst convenient I'm not convinced it's a good use of the money.

The e-books are also tempting, again for convenience, but we already have the regular books.

Then there's stuff like [The World of Fire and Ice](http://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Ice-Fire-History-Westeros-ebook/dp/B00O0FY73C/ref=sr_1_7?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425031496&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=game+of+thrones) which looks great, but someone on here recently said you're much better off getting the actual book due to the amazing illustrations and maps.

There are also some other George RR Martin books like [The Ice Dragon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ice-Dragon-George-R-Martin-ebook/dp/B00NS9USZC/ref=sr_1_12?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425031578&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=game+of+thrones) which caught my interest - any of them worth getting?

Renly or Stannis. two of my friends and I are arguing that Stannis would be a better king, but my other Friends think Renly would be a much better king.

Arguments for STANNIS:
-He's more experienced having ruled over storms end and Dragon Stone.
-He is older and wiser.
-He is more responsible.
-Understands the basics of ruling.
-He is a good Battle Commander.
-Renly is described as a party kid and would likely turn into something similar to Robert Baratheon.
-Renly isn't good with money and probably would waste it on feasts and parties.
-Renly's Homosexual secrets could be harmful to his reign if it was discovered.

Arguments for RENLY:
-He is loved.
-He has the support of the Tyrells.
-Stills supports the Seven unlike Stannis who is promoting the Lord of Light.
-Stannis is not very liked.
-Stannis holds grudges.
-Stannis is an ass.
-Stannis is a bad politician.
-Renly is good at making Allies.
-Renly's likability will help the realm prosper.

Last warning.  
  
For those still here, if you were waiting until character names were mentioned, it's regarding Stannis, Melisandre, Jon Snow and the Lord of Light/Azor Ahai. Show spoilers are only up to S02E10 (Valar Morghulis), but this post will include ADWD/all book spoilers and some future book/show speculation.  
  
Right, so. After Stannis is defeated at the Battle of Blackwater in E9, there's a scene with him and Melisandre about 20 minutes into E10. Stannis is grovelling about how the Lord of Light 'lied', and how Melisandre told him that she saw his victory in the flames. Melisandre paces around a little and says ""the Lord of Light only allows me glimpses"", and after Stannis chokes her to make a point she starts off on a very interesting monologue:  
  
""This war is just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear... and it will all be worth it, because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep beside this pretender and that one, you will be King.""  
  
At the very end of ADWD, Jon Snow is (possibly) assassinated by his men in the Night's Watch. Melisandre is nearby, and it is assumed, at least on my part, that she is going to use some R'hllor mojo to 'revive' him, essentially making him reborn (in fire). Assuming that this happens, and assuming that Melisandre's glimpses into the fire are somewhat trustworthy, everything that she mentions in her S02E10 monologue applies to Jon Snow just as much as Stannis.  
  
Jon's war has just begun, it will likely last for a long time. Thousands of Wildlings and Night's Watch will die at his command. He has already betrayed the men of the Night's Watch (and the order) by allowing the Wildlings to pass through the gates, and may well betray them again. He considers himself to have betrayed the Stark family by not going south to help Robb in the war when he had the opportunity, and he has betrayed everything he held dear in order to get to this point in his story: his family, duty, and honour (sorry) in ignoring the vows he took at the Night's Watch regarding Ygritte.  
  
Given all of these happenings, Jon is shaping up to seem strikingly like Azor Ahai, the Son of Fire, Warrior of Light, Prince that was Promised (this one in particular, seeing as if Rhaegar and Lyanna are Jon's parents, Jon would literally be a prince that was promised, by Ned, to be kept safe), etc. He seems to fit almost perfectly into Melisandre's visions as well as sharing a number of other Azor Ahai-esque traits:  
  
The Azor Ahai checklist is, to the best of my knowledge, as follows: reborn (revived by Melisandre) in salt (Bowen Marsh's tears) and smoke (Jon's wound is smoking at his supposed death), having a fiery sword (arguably the Night's Watch, or his Valyrian steel sword, or something yet to come), something to do with a dragon (not a lot here, unless him and Dany join forces at some point, which would be very cool), a sacrifice (again, not much here, but he has made sacrifices in the past and more may happen in the future), and having Aerys and Rhaella Targaryen's blood (Rhaegar's son would have the blood, which if Jon is, he ticks this box too).  
   

I'm just rewatching Game of Thrones after finishing ASoIaF and noticed this monologue in particular. Granted a lot of Melisandre's visions are rather vague, but it seems to connect very well to Jon Snow, in my opinion at least.  
  
Mostly just wanted to share in case someone would like to tear this view apart, or maybe share some thoughts. I'm pretty convinced Melisandre has confused Jon with Stannis in the visions and this just adds fuel to that fire for me.",10,10,False,self,,,,,
