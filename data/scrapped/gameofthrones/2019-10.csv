Could imagine being a villager, and having to watch your family being carried off by raiders you cannot defend them against? Since they outnumber you by at least dozens to one, are much more physically stronger and combat experienced then you, and are armed to the teeth.

They are not like the r/letsnotmeet perverts, whom you could easily dissuade by simply yelling at them. If you heroically attempt to intervene, you would either end up

A) killed on the spot B) dragged off with the rest of your family

To make matters worse, the assailants are going to take your family members to a foreign land that is completely inaccessible to you. Thus, you will never see you family members again. I cannot even begin to imagine how much damage the lack of closure would have on you.

Both these are fiction based on history and I thought they would scratch the itch of waiting for the latest GOT season. Unfortunately both failed to come close and just left me disappointed... although Vikings has its moments I gave up after season 2. Recently I tried to get into HBO's Rome which should of been right up my alley. It's more historically accurate than the others and the story was really interesting but I just find myself getting bored with it and comparing it to GOT all the time. One of the reasons I think it's because the production value on GOT is so high you barely notice your watching a TV show and you get drawn into the world whereas on other shows it just looks like actors dressing up. Has this happened to anyone else? Will any historical drama live up to the excitement and brilliant story of thrones?,10,4,False,self,,,,,

I like the cinematography. I like how they both stood their ground. I like the historical references.

It ends with the same score as ""the feast scene"" in ""The Last of the Starks"" - the ominous version of Dany's theme since there is also a complicated ""clash of interests"". It was there from their very first scene together.

It just seems to be so long ago.

I would also like to point out that season 7 Dany is the best looking Dany. She was just missing a crown with a dragon motive.

That's it. That's the post.

I myself have shared a lot of the same feelings but it wasn't until rewatching the last council scene that it dawned on what the real problem is. He leaves the small council to go find Drogon and let them run the country. So he doesn't have any real interest in ruling and instead leaves it to the council to do it. You know who that sounds similar to.... Robert Baratheon! It hit me like a lightning bolt but the story has gone back to square one with a king who doesn't have any real interest in running the country which is how this whole mess got started in the first place. So after all the misery, Westeros has gone through they get stuck right back where everything was in season 1 and nothing has truly changed.

Now you must be asking, why turn off Subtitles if its easier for you with Subtitles on. My reason behind this is because Ive watched movies and tv shows with Subtitles on all my life, and ever since I found some conversations with people difficult to follow and have to often ask of them to repeat what they just said.

And no, im not upset cause a girl killed them, anyone could have killed them and id be mad, i was in the minority who actually wanted the white walkers to win. It was also more of how they died was especially insulting and then I had to be kept telling how this was the greatest fantasy if not greatest drama on tv. And the dragons were basically wasted, I understood sadly the one dragon(the one the night king killed) became a white walker dragon and had to die but there was no reason to kill that other dragon imo rhaegal i think his name was. And the last one drogon got a horrible end cause his mom died and he left and is alone, possibly the last dragon on earth and im afraid the humans were going to hunt him down and kill him.

The overall magic themes were done very poorly in the show overall and it angered me when people said this is the greatest fantasy drama, if you want to claim its the greatest human drama, that is fine but they poorly did the magic elements. I would have at least redeemed the white walkers and kept all the dragons alive cause of how so little the magic elements are. That is why I am not super excited for the upcoming prequels cause they are prequels, anything magic in it be a creature or a magic spell will either be destroyed or go into obscurity cause they wont make it to the main show except the white walkers and the original 3 eyed raven.

Basically I just hope I wasnt in the minority when the white walkers lost, while everyone else on social media was cheering for it, I was basically on the inside crying cause for a magic creature like that to have an impact the way they did on a true adult channel was rare, true blood wasnt good enough and I thought game of thrones would do it better, clearly I was wrong. Maybe there is an alternate ending/scene in the game of thrones season 8 dvd but it doesnt matter cause it isnt canon, its basically fan fiction.",44,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

He said he stopped reading stuff about his character online after season 2 because it was hard to avoid internalizing the hate for his character. 

I imagine it couldnt have been easy with this being his breakout role and all of the massively increased attention and spotlight on him, even having come from a family of actors and growing up among them.

He did a hell of a good job with this show, and I genuinely will be disappointed if he does not win the Emmy he nominated himself for. He killed it from beginning to end.

If not for the knights of the Vale, who were loyal to Sansa (Sansa, *not Littlefinger*, as many people tend to ignore or forget), Jon and his forces would've been wiped out by Ramsay's forces. While individually he did pretty well in combat (killing like twenty good men in the skirmish and defeating the Bastard of Bolton himself), he did a piss poor job of actually leading his men. He would've been killed in the first cavalry rush by Ramsay if his didn't save him first, and that too because he broke formation out of rage at losing Rickon - which, while completely understandable, still cost him. Fighting bravely is good and all, but that in itself does not make a King.

He didn't even think of arming Wun Wun with, say, a tree or some sort of makeshift armor - either of which would've made him much more dangerous in battle and allowed him to take out a lot of soldiers with one swing. I don't even think Ghost, a direwolf who is completely capable of taking on grown and armed fighters, was involved. There was no real strategy from Jon other than the one that wouldn't have won him the war anyway, and the one he deviated from.

At least when Robb was KITN, he did a *far* better job. He beat the Lannisters, led by men the size of Tywin and Jaime, THREE times over. He captured the Kingslayer in one of these battles. He tricked Tywin into squandering his numerical advantage. Even the proud lord of Lannister acknowledged Robb and believed he would not fail unless they resorted to dirty tricks such as collaborating with the Boltons and Freys to murder the Starks at a wedding. The guy also put people like Greatjon Umber in their place, whereas neither Jon nor Sansa could successfully do likewise to the Northerners THEY dealt with.

no but seriously there was [this whole scene with cersei killing missandei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J92W-e82e9s) in episode 4 of season 8, which I know caught flack for the magic disappearing mountains, but if you look at the Kings Landing map in the books, the city sits on plains, which is strategically important to Aegon I.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty hilarious of d&amp;d to overlook this when designing King's Landing at first, but I don't know whether I completely disagree with their decision to remove them. Consistency is great but (warning: sidetrack):

&amp;#x200B;

King's Landing in the book/s8e4 is fairly similar to Troy in the Trojan War. The wall of Troy had a bastion that overlooked the Trojan Plain in order to spot enemies, as did King's Landing. Also, some more symbolism, Robert's Rebellion was sparked by Rhaegar stealing Lyanna, betrothed to Robert (Paris stole Helen, Queen to the Spartan King Menelaus, sparking the Trojan War to retrieve her). Of course, it ain't a perfect metaphor but still maybe interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

The closer visual likeness to Troy is not the only reason I like the writing (though the following still doesn't excuse the invisible mtns as much, if the last thing even does lol). I just enjoyed that Cersei has her champion throw Missandei from a tower to mark the beginning of the end (as she did at the beginning with Jaime and Brandon to start events). Just a nice little callback.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, love or hate it overall, I hope this post gives you a reason to feel like watching season 8 wasn't a total waste of time. Just basically mostly one. I also am sorry if any of this has been said before.",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

First of all I wanna clarify, I'm not saying this in a pervy mode, I'm legitimately curious about it, let me explain myself

The show never backed down on nudity as we all obviously know at this point, it even went to ridiculous lengths to show unneeded nudity, and it didn't back down Daenerys doing it, with Missandei, etc

Sophie Turner was underage in the first season(s?) I get it, but so was Maisie Williams, and even she got nude at one point, tho not as explicitly as other cast members but it still happened

But the show seemed to go out of its way to ""censor"" Sansa's scenes, it didn't have any problem with Showing Khal Drogo raping Dany, with Ramsay it is cut and the witnesse's reaction

It shows Dany bathing bare chested for the lulz but it does face shots when Sansa is bathing 

It shows a *way younger* cast member, Maisie sorta getting naked, but never Sansa

Again, I'm not asking as a pervert, I'm literally curious if it was policies or contract or what, because for a show as explicit as this, it specifically worked to avoid any Sansa nudity scenes, but went out of its way to show some nudity in our faces from other cast members or extras",18,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if there was a post-credits scene... A raven is flying over forested hills and comes over a peak looking over Volantis. Drogon on top of the sept watching the sunset with people wailing or whatever in the back-round (essos still believes Dany is good). Raven keeps flying and sits in the window at the top of the sept, where we hear soft chanting. 2 secs of Brans face visibly disturbed in Warg zone. We get a birds eye shot from the top of the Sept as 50 reds chant move in a circle motion. We see at the epicenter a table in the middle, circle zoom from top of sept downwards to reveal that Dany is on the table, just as John was. Show brans face again, singing and music increases, shots of the reds going nuts with increased motion and chants, camera returns to falling down onto her body, last moment close up shot as dany opens her eyes.

One major plot hole that I couldn't understand was the troop numbers at the battle for Kings Landing and the subsequent burning of the city. I believe that I have created a solid bit of lore friendly head Canon that I will hope turns out true and I wanna share.

After the Battle of the Long Night, we saw Dany get absolutely decimated as far as her armies were concerned. The Dothraki took the worst beating, and we don't see them again that episode after their lights go out. The Unsullied also suffered heavy losses. However, after that episode, they have a strategy meeting where they say that they have half of each force as far as manpower goes. How is that possible?  One answer: The Iron Bank.

After Cercei pays off her debt to the bank and hires the Golden Company, the viewer is led to believe that the bank is backing her claim to the throne. There is an issue though. With the old debts payed off, the bank will not have as much power over the crown that it once did.  Also, they would be putting all their eggs in one basket against the Breaker of Chains, who brought Slavers Bay to heel. If Dany won, what would stop her from sacking Braavos next? Any shrewd banker knows that you have to hedge your bets. 

How do you keep the Targaryen girl in line? You put her in debt. 

What she really needs are boots on the ground, and she seems to like using the Unsullied and Dothraki. There are far more Unsullied than what Dany liberated. They have been bought and sold for over 3000 years. All the major cities of Slavers Bay have their own Unsullied troups. It wouldnt be so hard for the Bank to aquire a fair sized chunk of them and ship em over the sea. Then comes the Dothraki. Did you know there are already Dothraki in the Seven Kigdoms prior to Dany &amp; company? There are some that ride with the Bloody Mummers as well as other groups. These men would gladly ride for anyone for the right price, so acquireing them is fairly straightforward. There was also a strong Northern presence at the battle. There were several houses that did not heed Jon's call when he tried to reinforce winterfell from the incoming Night King. I'm sure these houses had some northern men that the Iron Bank could lean on them to donate. This Also explains why the one northern soldier during the battle Attacked Jon and how they did not listen to him. There was no real loyalty there. 

So we got the army, what do they ask of Dany?  Please burn the city to the ground. Rebuilding a city would cost an extraordinary amount of gold. Who better to help finance the rebuilding than the Bank? It would ensure the crowns debt and it's subservience for the next 100 years. Plus, if she doesn't do it, just have the new troops turn on her closest friends. Dany was forced to do this, as it was the only way for her to win.

So, the Golden Company. Why did they perform so awful? Even Euron Grejoy remarked on how pitiful they were after he easily murdered two of these 'top notch' mercs on the ride over. They brought no elephants, and seemed only practiced in marching formation. I believe that this was a token army, not the actual Golden Company. The Golden Company has an awesome track record, and is the favorite force of the Iron Bank to use when it needs military muscle. Why would they let Cercei have such an asset for such a risky proposition? What Cercei got, was a gaggle of slaves in shiny armor. 

In the end, the bank always wins. If Dany wins, then they can say 'look how helpful I am and btw you owe me'. If Cercei got lucky? 'we knew we'd back the rightful queen... How are you planning on rebuilding the Lannister army?'.

I hope the books or subsequent shows somehow confirm this, as it is the only way I can see this making sense. Thanks for reading.



TLDR: The Iron Bank approached Dany and offered her fresh Unsullied troops and Dothraki mercanaries for the siege on Kings Landing.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Which brings me to my question - why is Tyrion named Tyrion? It's intriguing that just as how Tywin and Tytos's names begin with the 'Ty' part, so does Tyrion. We also know there were past Tyrion Lannisters at least in the book, one of them was apparently a disgusting psychopath (known as the 'Tormentor' for his habit of making women bleed) but the others were more or less okay and relatively well-respected.

My prediction is that Jon and Dany will have to give up their baby in a pact with the White Walkers. Melisandre has pointed out that prophecies are a tricky thing and the show has always foreshadowed that they are often partly interpreted an example would be The Prince/Princess(High Valeryian) That Was Promised.My thoughts are that this part of the prophecy wasnt interpreted fully and that the full interpretation should roughly have been the prince that was promised(sacrificed) to the lord of Light or to the Others(white walkers in the books) to save humanity. The show has been foreshadowing the sacrificing of children  for the greater good and survival for a long time eg Kraster sacrificing his sons to not be harmed eg Stannis sacrificing Shereen for the snow to melt and many other eg The Witch sacrificing Danys unborn child(only death can pay for life and she wasnt talking about the horse) to keep Drogo alive.Its been a constant theme in the series. Which brings us to the one of the biggest hints in the show has ever given us. The story of Ned Stark defeating Sir Arther Dayne. It shows that stories of past glory often need to be taken with a pinch of salt. The way Arther Dayne was defeated was dishonorable(stabbed in the back by Howland Reed) so in order to cover it up Ned chose to tell a glorious story of how he defeated him head on. This brings us to the story of Azor Ahai it is said that in order to create light bringer a weapon that was used to defeat(insert finger quotes here) the white walkers the first time around Azor Ahai had to create a sword and stab the love of his life through the heart in order to temper and cool down the sword,it took him 180 Days to create the final sword that was used(180 days is 6 months,children can be born after 6 months..see where this is going).My theory is that Azor Ahai sacrificed his child to the white walkers and had to stab his wife in order for her to release the child (as she was obviously protesting)to drive back the white walkers. To cover this terrible act up a glorious and heroic story was told( Like the Ned fight at the tower of joy). If the white walkers had been defeated by Azor Ahai they wouldnt be troubling the good people of Westeros up to now would they? Everyone has been wondering what their motive is,George RR Martin has described them as not evil and completely bad just misunderstood. My thoughts are the reason for their attack is simply they are coming for THE PRINCE/PRINCESS THAT WAS PROMISED TO THEM in prophecy! To be their leader maybe  but who better to be the leader of the White Walkers than a child who possesses magical blood of the Targaryens and the magical blood of the first men. This act of sacrifice is the reason why there must always be a Stark in Winterfell(something that has been needlessly repeated in the show and books so many times), because the Starks(the first men) that have always been there(before Bran the Builder put up the Wall) knew the true dishonorable act of how the white walkers were driven back the first time they attacked and the sacrifice that needed to be made and have always passed down this dark secret from generation to generation but now the secret got lost over the years .Now lets bring it home! Melisandres prophecies have not been incorrect,what has been incorrect is the way shes interpreted them the person shes seen who she thought was Stannis leading the war against the dead and bringing some kind of peace and win was in fact Jon and how his child(Lightbringer) will be used in a pact to drive the White Walkers back cause lets be honest even with 2 Dragons and all those armies theres no chance in hell they are winning that fight.

I decided to enter Jon Snow to see what it would produce. The result was amusing so I followed with some others (retrying a few times to get something good), and here they are:

**Jon Snow**

&gt;Jon Snow (Red Viper) Character Information: Red Viper Character Profile: Red Viper is a famous ""Wildling hero of the Seven Kingdoms"" who led an army against the Boltons during the Stark Rebellion. He is a former king, son of a Tyrell family squire, and also the cousin of Tyrion Lannister, making him one of the first-born sons of Lannister royalty. He was last seen during A Dance with Dragons , and has been portrayed in one of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books. Jon Snow (Red Viper, as seen in A Dance with Dragons ) is currently residing at Winterfell. According to George R.R. Martin in A Storm of Swords, his father was the Hand of the King when he ascended to a seat of power and was known as The Lion of Winterfell.

**Arya Stark**
&gt;Arya Stark (Dany's cousin) is a powerful character, much like Theon Greyjoy's, who wields much power (and power-related slang) such as: the dragon, the power sword, the dragon, soul-snatching, the secret door, power-saving, a power sword? One might think of her as a dragon, and one might not, depending on whether one's eyes are open or closed as one's mind drifts into the realm of the mystical or one's mind drifts deeper into what might be the world of demons. Either way, she wields a power sword which is almost always described with her name (though in the latter, we may be misremembering what it is, since the phrase in question does not seem to have been recorded until the early to mid 19th century).

**Sansa Stark**
&gt;Sansa Stark, a.k.a. ""Sansa, the Lost Girl,"" who has also been on our wish list for years, is back in another new role. She makes a very small appearance during a flashback, during which she talks to Benjen about his past, and we also learn there is something happening at the Wall with the Blackfish and Jon Snow. The scene is a quick glimpse at what to expect from Sansa's character  and it's not the first time the TV series has dealt with her in the flashbacks. She first appeared in Season 8's ""Hardhome,"" which revealed that she had been captured by the Faceless Men before being rescued by Daenerys. She returned in Season 9's ""Battle of the Bastards,"" when she helped Jon get his arms back after they were stolen by the Night King. In Season 10, she played a minor role in the climactic battle with the White Walkers.

**Tyrion Lannister**
&gt;Tyrion Lannister  is not only a fan of the show, he's also a big Game of Thrones fan himself; he even appeared in a  Season 6 episode  as a character called ""Tyrion the Brave"". As you can see, he was wearing a Lannister outfit, and a Lannister battle suit. As I said before,  Sansa Stark  played the main character of the season 6, and even though she had a Lannister accent, she wasn't really a Lannister. That's probably why we were given more characters with Lannister accents (e.g. Jaime Lannister), not to mention the many other characters who actually know a Lannister accent, like Brienne of Tarth  and Littlefinger (aka Melisandre). The main reason I'm talking about this scene is that if you think about it, it could be used as a kind of subversion of the ""Game of Thrones"" TV Series. In  season 2,  Arya Stark  was a real person and a character from her own story.

**Cersei Lannister**
&gt;Cersei Lannister  wound up being shot in the abdomen by Jaime while her sister Margaery suffered a severe burn. Both sisters have the scars and the scars of their wounds have become a part of both their characters. In one scene Jaime takes the blame for Cersei's wounds and Cersei is furious. Cersei says that Jaime is the reason her wounds were so bad because he thought someone else would be blamed too and he should be punished. She is angry and hurt that she feels wronged when someone else should have been blamed. In another scenes she is upset and upset when her sister Margaery's hand is cut. She is upset that she feels that she was not in control and could have seen it happening and is upset that they will not admit fault even though neither character will be getting any sympathy. She is also upset that Cersei will not be able to go to King's Landing as a result and will not have a home in this world because of having to stay back in Winterfell with her sister's wounds. 

**Jaime Lanniser**
&gt;The first person Jaime meets at Winterfell is Lord Eddard Stark. Jaime was a Stark from the Free Cities, he served at the Wall for one season and then left him on the tourney grounds to fend for himself. Now he has been taken captive by Cersei Lannister's Lannister soldiers and will soon be beheaded if he doesn't surrender on his wedding night. Eddard Stark is a loyal Stark and a great warrior. He holds no grudge against Jaime, though he is aware of Jaime's true allegiances and wishes to end the war and bring order to the Seven Kingdoms. Eddard Stark was born a Stark, so he is a major Stark character, and I think is the Stark character the fans (especially those that watch the show) most relate to. After Jaime and Cersei make their first appearance we see the two standing at a table holding a banner which says ""All of Westeros - Welcome to Winterfell"". Eddard Stark takes up the banner and joins in the Battle of the Fist of the First Men, winning.

**Ned Stark**
&gt;Ned Stark  said that he had the ability to create a shield from air, but it never happens.  The only other time he uses this ability is when he was in his cave looking for the dragons.

**Hodor**
&gt;Hodor  is the central character of this work; and though he has three sons from a marriage to Tanya, Hodor is by far the most popular. In the novel, it is in no small part in reference to him and how he was treated by his father that the book was made a movie, a feature that has been repeated across the centuries.
The book starts as an early version of our present day, with Hodgins' sister Yara, Horkan's son, playing a series of pranks on the family of the same name and their servant, in order to distract them from the discovery of a tomb at Belz. A couple of years later, Hodgins begins to suspect that he has an adopted son, the one whom his father sent him to protect, who he can't quite remember. The family is living a life of luxury and convenience at a small hilltop estate, and they all seem to get fatter, but Hodgins finds he cannot enjoy himself.

**Joffrey**
&gt;Joffrey Baratheon  has been dead for three years.  And if you're going to claim that he's an innocent man as well as a hero then how about you admit that he died trying to get someone to care? I'll wager that the average Baratheon in the Seven Kingdoms, who have to deal with a constant stream of lies and falsehoods, is the least sympathetic character in the Westeros universe. It's really, really hard to take Joffrey Baratheon seriously if you're not a fan of Game of Thrones.  Not only does he have the personality of a fucking slavering lizard, he's also been the victim of a thousand petty murders in his life and a thousand more petty betrayals.
And yet, Joffrey's death has not slowed him down and he's going to be out there doing all the things we love as a fan of the show: bullying his way to the top of House Baratheon and his love interest, Myrcella Baratheon; plotting against the king and his wife; and of course, the ultimate battle.",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The cinematography was top notch and the CGI was really amazing (cant even imagine the millions spent on this episode alone). But storylines seem rushed and cut short. Whats more infuriating is to know that D&amp;D(main writers) were offered 10 episodes but refused and stuck to 6. The content and direction of the plot is good, for the source material (GRRM storytelling) is good but when its translated to the show it just feels so rushed (this applies mostly to season 8)

Daenerys is my favorite character from GoT, ever since I read the books. Like most Dany fanboys Im not here to complain about her going evil, I actually really liked the idea of a ruthless queen, or something more mad and twisted like a GoT Joker if you will. My problem is that this wasnt developed at all, and I dont mean mere weak foreshadowing, but her descend to madness happened in the span of 2 episodes! I feel like this is something that had to be developed through a couple seasons or at least a full season. Like if lets say the Varys betrayal happened earlier, and more signs of her going mad or changing.

They couldve made her character infinitely more interesting and add depth to the plot. Like for example, lets say after burning down the walls and breaching the city, her and Cersei were at a standstill, and Dany tried contacting her through diplomacy but it failed, and THEN she had no choice but to burn up the whole city. This wouldve made her morally grey, and her character would be much more complex.

This wouldve also saved Cersei from complete character assassination. One of the most strategic woman who has held the iron throne for years, and defeated so many enemies and rivals, was represented as a spoiled baby. I understand that they were trying to do something like her pride will be her downfall but the whole episode is just Cersei staring into nothing... she is not even properly giving orders to her army or servants, she doesnt even consider scape, and her advisors barely advise her. 

If this episodes plot was stretched out they could show her slowly loosing ground/troops in kingslanding, and spiraling down as she hopelessly tried anything and everything to win the battle. Instead she just looked at the city burning with no reaction. This makes her character look so pathetic and weak, not to mention extremely dumb, something Cersei is not. Not to mention she is also pregnant, its been establish she would do anything and everything for her children, so its unbelievable to be that she would just... stand there like that. Because she seemed so calm the whole episode in the face of the destruction, and wasnt doing anything at all, I really though she had one last trick up her sleeve. Like maybe when all Danys soldiers were inside the city she would blow the whole place up or something.


TL;dr: the writers eagerness to end the show severely hurt the development of the plot and story archs. Portraying Dany as suddenly insane, instead of showing a slow spiral down to madness, and painting Cersei as a 2 year old weaken their characters and makes the show look childish.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

There are three of us. 2 are familiar with a particular show (usually very popular) and one is not and they are out of the loop. We are starting with Game of Thrones going episode by episode, but we get into there things. We also come up with our own ads very funny. Give it a good 5 episodes I bet you will start liking it.

We started with Game of Thrones. Get passed the first 3 you will start to really enjoy it, sorry for the sound that too gets way better.

I'm doing a paper on Ovid's ""The Metamorphosis"" and about how it ties into the world and history of GOT. Obviously, there is the ""culture of excellence"".

However, I am wondering what else I can connect between the two. Keeping in mind that I am aware of GOT's deep roots in Norse/Old Gods mythology, and that it needs to be ancient Roman, every idea helps.

* Both saw an insane amount of evil and suffering and endured as much in spite of their relative youth. 
* Both have a strong desire to protect the innocent and the downtrodden and are willing to punish the wicked in extreme ways. Both break the gender mold in that Arya wants to be a badass fighter and Daenerys is something of a warrior princess herself (and wants to be queen in her own right, as opposed to through her husband). 
* Arya also loved historical female ''heroes'' such as Nymeria and Aegon's sisters like Visenya Targaryen, who coincidentally is Dany's ancestor. It wouldn't be hard to imagine her being amazed by Dany's dragons too.

 Chapter One

\- Adult content &amp; Adult language

It was a little cold than last time when Jon Snow was on a journey behind the wall which , incidentally, was with his friend, Tormund Giantsbane , who is also with him now, but this time with The free folks without any aim after the end of the last war and The sky was covered with a veil of clouds.

Jon Snow stared at Ghost with a smile on his face because he realized that his loyal wolf was last one left from his family , specifically the family that brought him up ,and his mind began a new internal conflict again to reminder him how he killed his beloved queen who loved him and he, also, loved her back truly ,and she was the last one from his real family ,and that was erupting the conflict inside him . he thought to him did he do the right thing or he missed up to became last Targaryen alive ,and the conflict increased more when he thought of this question which he haven't found an answer for it untill now and it seemed he never find the answer which was ""why R'hllor the lord of light gave him the life back."", was that to kill the mother of dragons who was also promised from the first servant of the lord of light that she was the promised queen of the seven kingdoms that has been sent to lead people against the dark, or the gods lied and Melisandre the red woman lied too. However he was brought back to life but why? as long as he will be sent back to the wall to live rest of his days on the wall as a man of the Night's watch .

While Jon Snow was drowning on his internal conflict and his depression which never left him since he killed his beloved queen and has been sent to castle black suddenly a fighting began between two girls from wildings and one of them was waving with her sword right to the neck of the other girl threatening her that she will cut her head right now . All of these things interrupted Jon Snow's thinking to wake up on the threat of the girl, but at the first Jon Snow didn't care about the threat more that the tone of the girl , and he stared at her .She saved him from his psychological conflict to begin a new conflict with this girl with his eyes .

\-""What the Fuck is that ? it is the same red hair not the hair only the eyes and the sharp facial features those were near and dear to my heart. Oh my godness ,is that real ? "" Jon snow thought to himself.

But Jon didn't care about her body which was bigger a little bit, and also about the scattered freckles on her face and her body which was more a little, she just made him remember that girl, Ygritte, the wild girl who was his first love. He went to her and tried to prevent her from killing the other girl but she never cared about him. He tried again to keep her away from the second girl before she cut her throat but she pushed him away and said.

\-""let me kill this whore, you know nothing . ""

Jon looked at her, and he was stunned opening his mouth, he couldn't answer or even think , then Tormund Giantsbane came to them. He was watching what happen, and he put his hand on Jon's shoulder laughing because he figured out the reason why Jon snow was amazed by the girl's answer and why he couldn't reply too.

\-"" it looks what happened in south made your mind go , man. "", Tormund said , and he continued saying ""This isn't she. don't worry, the wildings dont come back to the life after death as you , don't you see she looks more aggressive and has a larger butt ""

the girl asked wondering from their talks ""what is your problem ? this whore stole my dagger. definitly he didn't know the reason he wasn't a magician and she continued "" I don't look like anyone ,just there is one Evelyn in this world.""

\-Jon snow smiled and said "" she is unruly like her too.""

\-""mention a word like her again , and I'll send you to her in two second."", Evelyn said.

\-"" he doesn't like threats but on the other hand he likes killing girls. He has been sent back to the wall again because he kill mother of dragons , you had better tell him ""you know nothing , Jon Snow"" he loves that."" , Tormund said that and was laughing .

and suddenly howling of Ghost cut their talks , it seemed like he felt like something was coming or something strange was happening at the meanwhile and he keep his howling

\-"" Ghost , what happening ? calm down. "", Jon said.

But his howling became stronger and he went fast to the strange sound that anyone couldn't feel it but he felt it .

\-""Ghost..GhostGhost, come back to here."", Jon shouted, but Ghost didn't care about anything but the source of the sound that he was hearing , he kept going untill Jon Snow and the free folks couldn't see him anymore

\-"" where did your fucking wolf go. "", Tormund asked.

""I have no idea."", Jon answered

\-""It seems that you know nothing really. "", said Evelyn sarcastic.

\-""Maybe it seems that but now all I know we should follow him fast. "", Jon answered her.

\*\*

meanwhile , and at the capital king's Landing which got back the life again. It was been rebuilding again after Daenerys targaryen distroyed it with her dragons. The gold lion disapeared what was decorating the Red Keep hall and was replaced with three-eyed raven and that was decorating the hall of throne in this time .

The broken king, Bran Stark, joined small Council to discuss the recent news at the capital, King's Landing, where Tyrion lannister the hand of the king was a header of the council and beside him Minister of Finance and lord of Highgarden, Bronn, the warrior of the blackwater battle, and the grand maester of six kingdoms, Samwell Tarly, and Ser Davos Syros, and the great worrier, Ser Bryan, the king's guard.

\-""it seems like the current situation got much better, the people got the life back again and finally they got safe now at the capital."", tyrion lannister said.

\-""I hope so .. what about the fleet and city defences ."" , the king, Bran, said

\-"" we have built half of the fleet but we have a time there's no reason to be in a hurry as the wars are ended. "" Ser Davos answered.

\-""in any moment mayber a war wage anywhere and we should be ready , and also for any revolt we mustn't allow what happened in the past happen again. "" ,the king said.

\-"" I'm not an political expert but I know in wars and tricks, the six kingdoms are united for the first time in the history as I think. They have choosen their own king themselves, and the only separated kingdom is the north kingdom which under the rule of your sister, my king, and there is no chance for any Rebels if they want because they know what they will end up "" Bronn said.

\-""the only thing that I worry about it is what the history books always mentioned, this winter would be the longest winter ever in the history but as it seemed it was the shorter and it finished fast. So far I haven't found any strong explaination yet . why it was mentioned that it's the longest."", Samwell Tarly said.

\-"" It looks you are the smartest here, Sam .i care about changing in winter more than anything else, I remember well when I was pushed down from the tower and I became disabled can't move from the bed, and I remember when that big maid NaNa was telling me stories before falling in sleeping. I always asked her to tell me horror stories but she always said the coming of the winter is the real horror and it may last for thousands of years."" the king, Bran, said.

\-""The Night King has been killed by your sister, Arya, and I guess you saw her by your eyes, your grace, when she stabed him with her dagger through the heart of the Night King,."" Tyrion said.

\-And he continued "" the answer is that, the main reason of the longest winter was Night King , and killing the Night king means ending the long night and ending the winter. ""

\-"" the history books don't know the future, you are right. The winter ended when the Night King ended up but this don't explain why they expected that, this winter will be the longest. It seems like the understimated the human power. "" Sam said.

\-"" I'm still having dreams in the ice but I sent my revan and I made sure the winter has ended up, and there is nothing behind the wall to fear but we should send strong worriors for the Night's watch and rebuild the wall again like my grandfather, Brandon Stark, the builder did before, and if the dragons don't go to the wall ,we will end this winter forever."" The king said.

And he continued ""the dragons were the main reason of falling the wall if they weren't, the dead army wouldn't crossed the wall but now we killed the dead but we should take control of the dragons.""

\-""by mention the Dragon we couldn't find it, my king, it seems we really need Master of Whispers. ""Davos said.

\-Tyrion answered "" I don't think there is someone like Lord Varys now in whole the six kingdoms even in the north to make him Master of Whispers.""

\-""we don't need to a new Master of Whispers, there is who better than Lord Varys right here"" the kind said.

""who is he then."" Tyrion wondered.

\-""me "" the king answered.

\-""No one can see the past and what happening now but I can , I saw Drogon flying now in the sky of Meereen, but the problem is the people of Meereen are so furious of killing their queen, it seems they loved her truly "" the king, Bran continued.

\-""Definitely I saw that when I was with her. "" Tyrion said.

\-""Do they have a big army there? "" Davos asked.

\-""No, Daenerys left Daario Naharis with Second Sons and a few of the Dothraki to keep Meereen safe, and they never risk passing the narrow sea, we don't fear of them the fear of that dragon."" Tyrion replied

. -""No one can have a control of this dragon after his mother death. The dragon is a smart creature. "" Sam said.

\-"" And that make him very dagerous."" The kind said.

\*\* In the city, Meereen, the news of killing the Mother of daragons arrived at the city which became messy and disorderd because of Masters of Mareen who wanted the slave trade in Meereen again, and allies of Darrio Naharis who promised his queen to keep the city safe, and never allow slave trade come back again before she went to Westeros, but Darrio couldn't stand the killing his own queen or specifically the only girl who loved truly and he was ready to die for her.

Drogon has arrived at Meereen recently from the great pyramid of Meereen or specifically from the place where Daenerys kept her dragons there. Daario and his allies and Meereen people heard Dragon shouts, some of them went to the Dragon place to find that Drogon was still holding their dead queen between his claws, Daario and his companions tried to get close but Drogon screamed and that made them terrified and then he flew far away .The hand of Daario said "" Drogon knew this city s the best for her mother and the best place for burying her.""

\-"" I adviced her to stay here, but where di d this dragon went? "" Daario said.

\-"" No one know, and why is he still holding her until now ?"" The hand of Daario wondered.

\-""\*Dragon is going to Valyria and he will never leave his mother until she becomes bones between his claws"" a woman said who came to the place when she heard the dragon sound.

\-""But who the hell are you to tell us he will go there? "" Daario asked.

\-"" I'm Canivara the priestess of Volantis temple, Flame of The truth and The first maid of Lord of Light. ""a woman with red hair said.

\-""Forget these damn surnames. How did you know Dragon will fly to Valyria?"", Daario asked.

\-""Valyria is the land of Targryen family and where they found the dragons and they learnt how to tame them by magic , and didn't you remember when this dragon run away otherwise the other two dragons which their queen kept them in Meereen as this dragon went to Valyria. "", Canivara replied.

And she continued ""When Masters and Sons of the Harpy revolted, and you was trying to save your queen from the grip of Dothraki clans, as I was here in the pyramid of Meereen meeting this dwarf and his eunuch friend and I was telling them heir queen would come back, and Daenerys was the queen who was promised, and she was born from the fire to rebuild the world I saw that in the flames.""

\-""I'm sorry to disappoint you but as you saw she is dead now. The magic always lies."" Darrio answered.

\-""haven't you seen her coming out of the fire after she burnt the Dothraki chiefs ? I wasn't there but you bowed to her and you was staring at her because you loved her , and also you love the her lower part"" Canivara said.

\-"" So why didn't you save her life? And why didn't you tell her she would die there? Or she will rebuild the world from the other life "" Darrio asked sarcastically.

\- ""I am the servant of God, not God,"" said Kinvara

\- ""Everything happens according to God's will, but men and women make mistakes even the true servants of God, I have already told them before.""

\- ""Everyone is intact and in place for a reason, terrible things happen for a reason, and certainly the death of the Dragon Queen happened for a reason,"" Kinvara said

\-""What is the reason then?"" Darrio said.

\-""I can't explain now , but tell me did your queen do the right when she decided you wouldn't go with her in her journey to Westeros? Would that happen ? "" Canivara asked.

\-""Definitly no , I wouldn't let anybody to get close to her if that cost me my life. "", Darrio said.

\-"" Alright we should go to Valyria to find her and the Dragon."", Canivara said.

\-"" We can't go and leave the city in this messy, sir. "" The hand of Daario.

 "" Actually I don't care about what happening in this damn city and about it folk, and I don't even care about that foolish who is sitting in that throne there. ""Daarrio said.

\-and he continued "" The only thing I care about it that bastard who killed our queen, I won't calm down until I cut his head and put it to Drogon to swallow him.

"" I'll go with the priestess and four of our men to Valyria, and you will keep the city safe "" Darrio said to his hand.

"" unless I come back, make sure you won't too"" Darrio said to canivara

. \*\*in the north the situation is quiet , and the new queen of the north, ""Sansa Stark"", is doing well, and for first time since Targryen broke in winterfell by their dragons the north became one coherent kingdom and all the families of north is united and interdependant, and that because of Sansa's decission. The castle of Winterfell became stronger than before after the repairs and also army of north is better than before and all north families are united behind Stark family.

\*\*In the west Arya Stark youngest daughter of ""Ned Stark"" Still sailing toward the last spot in the west which all maps ends at it , to know what there are. In Dorne the new prince is loyal to the king of six kingdom, "" Bran Stark"", and the guard of Drone king is a young man . he is 17 years old and called "" The new Dorn Viper "" after he beated six people tried to kill the new prince with his own spear , he killed them in less than minute to make the people remember ""Oberyn Martell"", in his shape and his skills and that made the prince made him a guard for him .

\*\*back to behind the wall , Jon snow and Tormund and the wildings went behind Ghost and they approached to the end of Haunted Forest but suddenly they found something so strange unexpected, he was Ghost but dead. It was killed on the middle of symbol from snow , Jon approached to make sure, but it was too late, Ghost was lying couldn't move and he was already dead , there are some stabs obvious on his body. This symbol was for the Night king .

Jon lay on the ground beside Ghost, he was shocked and the tears in his eyes and he couldn't say anything , and he didn't know should he let these tears go for losing his loyal wolf and his only alive friend after killing his god father, ""Ned Stark"", or he shed tears for this symbol which meant the Night king came back again and the Great War went for nothing, but Ghost didnt let his to choose, he opened his eyes which became totally blue and Jon was looking at him , Ghost woke up and he started howling and he was about to attack Jon Snow, and that make Jon got away from him and Turmund holded his hand to help him to stand up and in the other hand he was holding his sword but Ghost didn't attack them he go away again.

\-""I will go for him. "" Jon said.

\-""Did you get mad?.....haven't you seen his eyes , there is a fucking thing there , and that thing want us to come to him and his message was your fucking wolf. "" ,Tormund answered.

\-""He was the only thing left for me in this miserable world, I'll never let him go ""Jon said.

\-""It seems that killing Mother of dragons placed your ass in your head instead your mind, if you go there , you will die definitly or you will have blue eyes. "", Tormund said.

\-"" I prefer to have blue eyes than I lose him and let him go. "", Jon said.

\-""Alright if you decided to go and want to die we will go with you, you won't die alone we will die together."" Tormund said.

\-""No. choose ten of your best men to go with me, and go fast to the wall with your people and send to Sansa in north and to the south to Bran and tell them what happened. Maybe Bran know who did that. "", Jon said.

\-""Didn't I say you lost your mind in south.who is here stronger than Giantsbane to come with your?"" Tormund said.

\-""You should go to them and tell them that to believe what happened, they know no one but you here.please Tormund go now we dont have time. "", Jon said.

\-""Don't worry I'll be with him and make him know these things. "" Evelyn said.

Tormund went fast and Evelyn with him and Ten of the best wilding men to join Jon toward forest tusks behind Ghost.

which she absolutely would not have been able to get to do if Beric Dondarrion hadn't just saved her from certain death (to be fair, with a solid assist from the Hound) only moments before

which he absolutely would not have been able to do if, counting backwards now past the last 5 repeats, he himself hadn't been literally resurrected from death back to life all those years ago the very first time by someone who was only merely attempting to invoke the hail mary-level possibility for no greater or more complicated reason than he was going to miss his good friend too much for his heart to bear, Thoros of Myr. A chain of events began for the purest, sweetest reason there could pretty much be. Plus, Thoros (along with Beric and the other men) only even got to the position to initially meet Arya Stark at all because he had failed at his originally intended task of converting King Robert to the Lord of Light.

Granted, I do say all of this kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it's a solid line of cause &amp; affect. and sure, one might say the Lord of Light did the heavy lifting, but, first of all... fuck 'em! (as Davos laments in 8x04 ""we fight and win his war, and he fucks off without any word of thanks or explanation"") And it was still Thoros who takes the first step, out of sheer desperation. I'm guessing it's significantly harder and much less likely for a fresh corpse to just pop back up without the red tape getting done by the normies first.",7,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud

Ibn Saud won a civil war, kicked out an occupying force and unified Saudi Arabia (sound familiar?). However to cement and stabilize the country he married one person from every important tribe for said dynasty.

So I'm curious to know what would have happened if Aegon the Conqueror did this; basically after conqueror Westeros he married one important highborn woman from every region. Do keep in mind that this was offered in canon but he refused.

But lets say he, and all his descendents, do and the dragons can still be bound to his dynasty. How does this change the way the continent and the series plays out?

On another note I always found it weird that GRRM didn't delve into polgyny has much as he should have given the setting and it feels out of place many times. I mean https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France#Personal_life was said to have nearly seventy illegetimate and legitimate children.

I guess one of the major problems with this is that Westeros will now be following the Open Succession method that most muslim realms did back in the middle ages. This is basically for trading for long term peace there's almost always a succession crisis or war after a monarch dies. Another issue may be trying to wipe out the Faith of Seven or for a reformation. 

Finally if we go to present day things (e.g. Robert Baratheon), things get really difficult. He'd basically have his hands full killing the descendants of all the Targaeryans and that's not including if he followed said custom.",2,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

The entire time I watch this show, be the first time or my hundredth rewatch, theres things, facts I cannot forget:

Sansa was a bitch (and still is imnsho) who would go out of her way to make people feel bad
Lommy was a bully, thief, and had no arc to change any of that
Caitlin went out of her way to make Jon feel as bad as he possibly could, and that was IN FRONT of Ned, seven knows what happened when he wasnt there in the room. 

Yet, the love that Sansa gets on various forums, the no! that reactors shout during the Lannister sack of the Nights Watch recruiting convoy when Lommy is killed (with the same sword he tried to take/use against Arya... what I call justice and irony combined... an ironic justice ), or people just forget 1/6th of Caitlins duties to her family was to try and mentally and emotionally destroy a child who had no where else to go to the point that he decided to make a pseudo ice prison his home (I hate blood, so I cant enjoy the red wedding, but if it wasnt for all that blood, I wouldve enjoyed watching her get killed, even more so if someone jumped out on the screen and said thats what you get for being an evil bitch to a helpless child)

I mean theres bad guy characters like Jaime and the Hound who people like and root for, but theyve accepted their roles as the bad guy and we often just hope they cross paths with a worse guy, so I understand the people who are behind them.

But the people who just go out of their way to hurt others for no reason like Sansa? Yeah, sorry bitch, I dont feel bad for you. Based on her attitude and the way she treated her own servants, god knows what ever she did to Jon was way worse than that pathetic 10 second apology she gave. Someone who has the willingness to hurt a child when they have done nothing wrong, probably a lot less than their half siblings, because they exist? Yeah, Id send her an invitation to the red wedding myself and wait on the rafters with a crossbow like that Coldplay guy did.

TLDR: Sansa is a bitch, probably gets it from Cat, Neddy needed to get his house in line, and theres a shit ton of other characters whos actions get overlooked.

On a side note: all those evil, horrible things Cersei did? At least she had a reason. Id have blown up the Sept as well. The entire Tyrell army had a chance to end it and failed, therefor every life at that place is forfeit.",14,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now I really doubt who the main antagonist is? Is it The Night King; Daenrys Targaryen or BRAN THE THREE EYED RAVEN? We never saw the Prince that was promised Prophecy (Who was Azor Ahai Reincarnation), nah it wasn't Arya Stark or Jon Snow Yet. I believe Bran The Broken is one of the incarnation of The Night King and all other Brandon Stark of Various Timelines. Think about how Bran plotted his way on becoming The KING of Westores. He could have saved Rhaegal &amp; Messandei by informing Jon that Euron was waiting so Dany would never be Mad Queen. He gave the dragger to Arya himself (I mean he could have given to anyone). How could The Night King see Bran unless he himself is a greenseer like Bran. It could also mean The Night King was there to kill Bran only or Bran just became The Night King after he touched Bran. As Tyrion Said ""life is full of Possibilities"" but in This Case GOT is full of Possibilities.

Drogon can burn cities to ash, with or without Dany's help - there's no reason to think otherwise. There was literally nothing and no one stopping Drogon from torching every other city in Westeros or outside - the scorpions were all gone, and there's no reason to assume other cities can just make their own in time before they get wrecked. 

Secondly, I still find it weird that Drogon just let Jon go instead of incinerating him on the spot. We know from the Dance of Dragons and other historical events that dragons are perfectly capable of killing Targaryens. Even if Drogon intended to screw off back to Essos instead of just burning random cities down in purposeless rage, there was no reason for him to not kill Jon when he had no problem killing complete innocents who at least didn't harm Daenerys at all.

Finally, it's worth pointing out that according to D&amp;D, Drogon did not destroy the Iron Throne because he believed it was the true source of evil (which is technically stupid, not philosophical) but because it was just a random object he could take his rage out on and happened to be in his way.",27,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here are my guesses:

\- Daenerys losts pretty much things when she first arrives to Westeros, as we saw in S7. But after the first attack in the Tyrell's lands (when she kills Tarlys) she attacks King's Landing with THREE dragons. I guess in the books they're not so big and one dragon can't destroy an entire city. Here she kinda destroys everything as we saw, but maybe not intentionally? I don't know, but I'm sure that this will happen BEFORE the Long Night.

\-I think we'll see the Lannisters death in half book 7. My guess is that Jaime kills Cersei as Jon did with Dany in S8, to ""protect"" her 'cause she's now a hopeless case. Maybe he figures this out after she makes the temple blow up, which might happen at the end of book 6.

\-About the dragons. I think they'll survive too. I believe that the Jon will end up on Rhaegal and someone else but NOT Tyrion on Viserion. Maybe a Greyjoy, has they have that horn? But I don't know what they could do after the Long Night.

\-Sansa will end up being Queen in the North. But just not by asking for it. 

\-Daenerys will die? Honestly I'm not sure. 

\-Jon instead WILL die. I mean, if he will be resurrected, once he does the job for R'hllor he should die. And of course his role will not be ""the one that gather all the forces for the Long Night"" as this doesn't have any sense, but to finally destroy the army fo the death. Once he does it, it can die.

\-Arya Stark... I don't know. For me, she seems kinda useless. We know D&amp;D used her just to ""give us an unexpected scene"" and of course after it she doesn't do anything major to the plot. Also in s7 she doesn't do anything, apart from playing ""i trust you i don't trust you"" with Sansa. Her character is strange to me tbh. Also I think that the revenge against the Freys will be done by Cat.

\-Varys and Baelish won't die so stupidtly. I believe that Varys will be killed by Dany, but not in that way, not as a traitor. 

That's it. For some other characters, I don't know or I don't care: Brienne, Tyrion and Bran... we know their fate and that will be it. Not as we saw in the show, but it will be that.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know this sounds ridiculous but if it had been well thought out early on and well written could it have been well received by the audience?

Ive noticed that all the main criticisms of the plot in the last series seem to hinge on things being either rushed or coming out of nowhere. Jon is built up as having this connection with Night King. It seems to single Jon out as its primary foe but then many fans feel that D and D tried to subvert expectations by having Arya kill him when there was no build up.

Dany to have a cruel and ruthless streak but again many feel there is a massive jump between killing off her enemies and slaughtering thousands of women and children with no remorse

So if say you decided Ramsay Bolton would be mellisandres savior and built it up throughout the series with a clear line of reasoning pointing to him..would people accept if hes not the traditional hero?

So I suppose what im asking is can a very controversial idea work given enough build up and good  enough writing?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

These mysterious beings that were harbingers of death, whom couldn't be manipulated by politics, were an amazing addition to what was otherwise a show filled with savy political machinations. (Much like the Darkspawn in Dragon Age Origins)

And then I got to the episode where we see the kid get brought to him in the Lands of Always Winter. And my heart sank a little bit. It just seemed to me that focusing on ""The Night King"" was less menacing that ""The White Walkers."" After all you kill one walker and there are others, but now we have a clear leader to go after and it makes the WW seem a little more human. Which I thought was a step down personally. 

Also the dude looked like a dork. He the crown atop his head made him look like such a doffus, and his armor looked like someone in the prop room was like ""Scary medieval armor? Here's something I farted out in five mins and I have put no thought into how this would function as armor.""

Some may say that I am being petty here, but the look of a monster is important. Michael Myers is scary partially because that emotionless mask is so unsettling, the Alien is scary partly because it's design is so strange (and oddly sexual too), and sure Pennywise looks like a dork because he's a clown but that's done intentionally because he preys on children (and because clowns can just look straight up scary).

So that's why I hated the NK before the show gave us all ample reasons to do so. And no I have not read the books.",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the last episode of the show, when a bunch of lords where sitting and trying to decide who will rule the throne, Sam gave a suggestion that everyone should vote on who's gonna rule. the other lords laughed him off because they thought its a silly idea, and they where absolutely right.

In got's universe, some factions had a vote system to decide their rulers (i.e nights watch) and it would prove to be a good method for the most part, but putting a voting system like this on the scale of 7 kingdoms will make you run into severe problems.

First of all, a voting system is most effective if you had people that are knowledgeable of the candidates and can have a reliable opinion on choosing the best leader. but in the medieval world you're going to have to deal with small folk. people with simple lives who are mostly illiterate, uneducated and are oblivious to anything outside their nearby vicinity. their best form of news about the outside world are tales and gossip, and it's very easy to bend the truth a little bit from mouth to mouth and the change the story. so even if they actually had a good sense of mind on politics which they most likely aren't, any chance they would vote for a faraway lord would be very rare since they dont know him and would probably just vote to the lord that's ruling them or to someone nearby.

Even if you would bring the small folk out of the picture and just include highborn, there will still be bias for any relatives that will be candidates or rivals that they might hold a grudge  due to many wars and battles that had happened through the show.

Also Alfie Allen. His decent into Reek was spectacular.

Maisie Williams is so underrated but shes easily top three for me. She and Lena deserved a real scene.

Sophie Turner was so good during her captivity in Kings Landing.

Charles Dance of course was incredible.

Natalie Dormer during that scene with the High Sparrow right before the sept blew up...Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what Im telling you!

The reality is, sometimes in war, you have to go in and fight the enemy in a place where civilians also live. While that does not justify killing civilians willy nilly, it does kind of weaken the excuse Tyrion and many far-left liberal types today have towards war and conflict. Sometimes the only way vicious tyrants such as Joffrey, Cersei, or Hitler can be removed (and innocent people on both sides be protected) is through direct war and movement to defeat the enemy leadership.

I've also seen people accusing Dany of trying to take King's Landing from Cersei, because that might end up killing people. Never mind the fact that literally no one had a problem with Jon and Sansa wanting to retake the North from the Boltons, even though a lot of the Northern houses actually swore fealty to the Boltons anyway. Never mind the fact that when it comes to Dany's war, the possibility of killing innocents or the tragedy of killing normal farmers or peasants who just happen to be soldiers exists, but the same is not true when it came to the Starks and their allies fighting Bolton soldiers on the field. Why do Lannister troops get humanized but not those on the Starks' opposite side? Are we really supposed to believe there weren't innocents even in a Bolton-ruled Winterfell who might have gotten killed or worse?",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Never mind how implausible the idea of such a revolution would be, as Cersei would never back down peacefully (this was clear from S6 alone, to say nothing of S7 or S8) and would unquestionably choose violence in one form or another. However, the weird part is that Daenerys  and only Daenerys  is held to this standard.

No one blamed or attacked Stannis for trying to storm and retake Kings Landing from the Lannisters. People in fact called him the Mannis, and GRRM himself dubbed him a righteous man (he does this in both the books and the show, so even if Show!Stannis is much more evil than his book counterpart, its not because of his decision to storm KL which is common to both versions). Likewise, Robb was planning to storm KL himself in S1 in order to save Ned from the Lannisters, even calling all his banners:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR8nlgMKW7Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR8nlgMKW7Q)

The reality is, sometimes in war, you have to go in and fight the enemy in their home area. This is often a place where civilians also live. While that does not justify killing civilians willy nilly, it does kind of weaken the excuse Tyrion and many far-left liberal types today have towards war and conflict. Sometimes the only way vicious tyrants can be removed (and innocent people on both sides be protected) is through direct war and movement to defeat the enemy leadership. Ensuring that there are zero civilian casualties may be difficult or even impossible. Ultimately, its impossible to fully, truly prevent this but this shouldnt get in the way of an overthrow. 

I've also seen people saying Dany trying to take King's Landing from Cersei is a bad thing, because that might end up killing people. Never mind the fact that the Iron Throne is hers by right since Jon ceded it to her. On the other hand, literally no one had a problem with Jon and Sansa wanting to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, even though a lot of the Northern houses actually swore fealty to the Boltons anyway and didnt want to help the Starks. Never mind the fact that the war to retake Winterfell could also potentially kill innocents there. 

Even in Danys case, the soldiers she goes up against are humanized and presented to Arya as normal peasants with their own lives and families. However, the Bolton and Frey soldiers we saw on the show do not get this treatment, and any good or innocent Boltons or Freys are pretty much absent.

I've been perusing GOT subreddits for a while and I've always wanted to discuss the show and books so I figured why not. 

I'm quite unhappy with how the show ended, like I know most people probably are. But one thing that I noticed was how enraged people were about the turn Jamie took. I was disappointed but at the same time I'm really not all that surprised.

I know going back to Cersei seemed out of left field for how far his character had come especially after leaving her side to go fight the Night King, but doing anything to get back to her, wanting to save her from Daenerys, it's not completely unbelievable is it? He loved her more than anything (for some reason) plus they're family. Even Tyrion wanted to help him make sure Cersei got away from King's Landing safely and they were NOT close even by normal sibling standards. 

I loved him and Brienne too, I think they would've been great together and Jaime so deserved a redemption. But his relationship with Cersei was very toxic, addictive even. It's not uncommon for people in real life to turn down something that would be good for them in favor of something toxic. It's sad but it happens and that's kind of how I see him going back to Cersei. She's an addiction to him and he relapsed. Definitely wasted potential of a character but sometimes shit happens and people choose the worst things for themselves. 

As a disclaimer, I do not defend the writing or how rushed everything was this last season. But I am curious if everyone's feelings toward the failed/adandoned redemption arc is because of bad writing or something else? Would Jamie running back to Cersei be received better if the writing wasnt so bad this last season?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Never mind the fact that even Harry Potter had its share of grey characters like Snape, Dumbledore and perhaps Draco (and his parents to a very very limited degree), and LoTR definitely made Boromir, Denethor, and Gollum pretty complex too, so one could argue whether this was ever a truly accurate belief. 

However, in light of how S8 ended, it's kind of hard to see that as still being true. From S1 to S8, there in fact are some clear ''good guys'' and some clear ''bad guys'', and yes, a few characters who start on one side and do end up on the other or nowhere at all. The Starks are very much the heroes of the story, and they remain heroic from beginning to end. Even the questionable or bad things they do are brushed under the carpet - Arya is never taken to task for the brutality of her killings when it comes to the Freys. Neither Sansa when it came to Ramsay. Jon goes beyond the Wall to be with friends and can come back any time considering Grey Worm just left. On the other hand, the Targaryens and Lannisters end up and are punished as villains. Jaime is unable to complete his redemption, Cersei dies a coward, and Tyrion is blamed for Daenerys's invasion (rightly or wrongly) as well as exempt from the history books for some reason. 

Even Dany's attack on KL is not exempt from this, and neither is the Night King's attack on Winterfell. Dany just becomes another evil villain instead of destroying KL by accident, say, through fighting Euron and the dragon he stole from her using a dragonbinder horn. That would even be realistic and fit in with GRRM's anti-war stance as a lot of war's horror in fact is relatively accidental and yet hurts innocents all the same. She could've ignited wildfire, possibly even be tricked into doing it by Cersei, destroying an entire city and going down in history as a butcher when her intentions weren't to go down as one. There is *no* element of gray to her corruption. Heck she is directly made out to be a Hitler type figure which is as evil as you can get. Never mind the fact that Dany has been compassionate AND ruthless - to just make her one and not the other not only is against her character, it also is against GRRM's own preference for gray and human characters.",23,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

While Cersei was seemingly set to be Mad Queen 2.0 with her destruction of the Sept of Baelor and part of King's Landing, the very next season forgot about this and made her pretty much useless as a foe for the Stark and Targaryen factions. Jaime made a masterful plan to abandon Casterly Rock and Euron took out Yara's fleet as well as the Sand Snakes, but Cersei herself did fuck all apart from be sadistic to the people who killed her daughter, break a promise to the Jon-Daenerys alliance about helping against the night King, and make an empty threat to Jaime.

In Season 8, it gets...even worse. Cersei is just moping around and crying, whining about elephants, having sex with Euron Greyjoy (another total joke of a character, although at least Cersei had potential to be a good villain if not a final one) without using it to manipulate him (something she was fond of doing in the books, and even in the early seasons), sends Tyrion and Jaime's friendly neighborhood sellsword to kill them, doesn't have the common sense to run away from or surrender to Daenerys's invasion until it's WAY too late, and ultimately dies not as a lioness with claws bared but as a weeping coward. Even S2 Cersei showed a thousand times more resolve in at least accepting her fate.

My question is, how would you guys fix her? One idea would be to make her the mad queen, not Daenerys, and have her be the one to blow up the entirety of King's Landing out of spite along with herself as a final act of defiance against the younger and more beautiful queen, possibly intending to take Daenerys out as well (this might or might not fail). Another idea would be for her to somehow collaborate with Euron and frame Dany for destroying KL or trick her into doing it whle the two escape, possibly involving stealing one of her dragons through Euron's dragonbinder horn (which too should've appeared on the show). Jaime finds out the truth, eventually tracks a now hidden Cersei down, and kills her.",6,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Tree-Eyed Raven is the arch enemy for the years to come. In Winterfell, Bran is extremely cruel/cold towards Meera Reed who supposedly saved his life. He says to her he is Tree-Eyed Raven now, letting her go away in tears. He says the same thing to some other people too. It is so because thats the truth - Tree-Eyed Raven skinchanged into Bran and merged with him. He is the most powerful skinchanger that ever was and ever will be. We dont even know what he was in the beginning  definitely not a human being. He is the Sauron of A Song of Ice and Fire. Back in the cave, Tree-Eyed Raven says hes waited a thousand years for Bran to come into his cave - he waited for someone with Brans' abilities to be able to finally exit that cave. In the book he also says that he has many names, and it is because over the centuries he had lured many skinchangers into his cave and merged with them to stay alive. Those skinchangers were very weak greenseers so he had to be in constant contact with the tree to be able to manipulate the world events. Previous Tree-Eyed Ravens/Crows dying body was Brynden Rivers/Lord Bloodraven, the Lord Commander of Nights Watch, around 100 years old. In reality Tree-Eyed Raven is thousands of years old. He is the evil force behind many bad things that happened in Westeros, including the magical creation of White Walkers/Night King. In the previous war against the Others, Children of the Forest had played a double game, in reality protecting Tree-Eyed Raven who has been controlling White Walkers from the day one. Children believe he is their ally, but he is not. He manipulates Bran to get touched by the Night King so that White Walkers could later easily find him and protect him, but also to come to the cave to destroy his old body and kill the last Children of the Forest he doesnt need anymore. During the Second Battle of Winterfell Tree-Eyed Raven works against men, probably communicating with the Night King and commanding him. Arya messed up his plans at the last moment. But he knows how to create White Walkers, and he is in the position of ultimate power now from where he can more efficiently work on destroying humanity. White Walkers will not be needed anymore, I suppose, one big dragon to merge with/skinchanged into would be more than sufficient.
2. Fire demon Rhllor needs humans to live and he knows if he doesnt intervene in the battle against Tree-Eyed Raven, he is going to perish together with his worshipers. That is the reason why he resurrects Jon and Beric, why he sends Melisandre to unite Dany with Jon, why Melisandre cames back to Winterfell, etc. He probably projected many instructions that day in Winterfell that men subliminally absorbed from fires. Rhllor is the force behind the victory. But he never helps free of charge, probably because he loses energy in the process. He feeds on human sacrifices and he wants many people burned to repay for the help he provided. Dany has always been cruel, but she is Defender of weak and powerless. Dany never went crazy. Lord of Light manipulated her with the visions in Drogons fires and made her harm those shes sought to protect (just like he did to Stanis). She was the only one who could do what was needed to be done. That day in King's Landing Dany saved humanity because she empowered Rhllor so that now he will be able to destroy Tree-Eyed Raven once and for all. Drogon knows what has to be done. He has to take Dany to Daario Naharis, the only man left Drogon sees as a friend and knows to love Dany, and who rules over Meereen full of red priestesses. Daenerys is the only one who can prevent Tree-Eyed Raven from merging with Drogon, and Rhllor has to resurrect her. Tree-Eyed Raven in the body of Drogon would practically be unstoppable.
3. After resurrection, Dany should be much better person. Jon killed her even though he loved her, and that fact should reveal to her that she was wrong. She knows Jon is extremely just and good person, and she deserved to die - not for what she did in Kings Landing, but for what she said to him before he killed her. When she finds out he went to the North, she will know beyond any doubt what kind of person he is. It would be nice if they would reunite in the final battle once again.

I hope G.R.R.M. will continue the story and somehow find the way to free Bran from Tree-Eyed Raven and give us better ending than one we saw on TV show.

The last book was in 300 and the last season was 306, making him 36 in the books and 42 in the show, too young to be the last Tarbeck/Reyne.

She considers killing him there but then she doesnt.  This frustrates many fans that Cersei the cruel unpredictable bitch didnt kill Tyrion who she has always hated and wanted to kill. But people also thought this was a betrayal to her character not to have some master plan when her enemies are right in front of her. But I say something different. I saw the same evil women thats been on this show for years. Because even if she killed them then and there she would never last long. She would still have most of Westeros against her. But she decided she was not gonna go down without a fight. Tyrion is pleading to Cersei saying her reign is over, but that doesnt mean your life has to end, your baby doesnt have to die. A lot of people are saying Tyrion is somehow being stupid with thinking Cersei would ever surrender. And I dont think he totally believes she would have surrendered. But its like he says to Qyburn he doesnt want to hear children burn. He is trying to avoid violence. This is the Tyrion Lannister I know. And I believe Cerseis big plan was to take Kings landing down with her. She knew killing Missandei would trigger Dany. Also the acting in this scene is brilliant. You can tell Emilia Clarke did not agree with the ending they gave her character, and she was great nonetheless. Thats a true professional. But lets not forget Lena only saying one line in the whole scene and yet showing show much emotion. When Tyrion mentions her baby she cries. Just such a thematic scene.

In the world of Westeros this was a controversial act. Jaime became the kingslayer and earned the disdain even of people who challenged Aerys rule. Jaime reflects that it is his finest act. 

&gt; I think it passing odd that I am loved by one for a kindness I never did, and reviled by so many for my finest act. 

Ik that the community sees this as a heroic act, oathbreaking for the greater good. And here he seems to agree. 

But *where is it said it was for the people*? Remember that Tywin was in the city, sacking, that he was asked to bring him his head too. And that both him and Jaime are in the city while Aerys wants to blow it to bits. 

So I really dont get why this becomes some selfless act he did all for the people with the community? Yes its a factor, any sane man is disturbed by thousands dying in the flames. Just like any sane man is disturbed by the idea of killing his own father or being blown to bits himself. Only honour values complicate this, really, 

I would get it if there were other acts of him trying to save common people, at this point. In AFFC and ADWD you could say that he tried to save common people, to keep his promises with Catelyn. But here? Hes saving himself and his father as much as the rest.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think Sam's younger sister makes the most sense. The Tarly's are one of the most powerful houses in the Reach so marrying into Houss Tarly would really help him consolidate his rule. She was engaged to a Fossoway in season 6 I think but there's no reason why that coudlnt have happened.

Another question, whos is the current Lord of Horn Hill? Unless King Bran changed thr rules of Maesters not being able to marry or rule then Gillys inbred son Baby Sam would be the rightful heir (if legitimized) since everyone thins he's Sam's son. A son comes before a sister. 

I think Sam is the lord though otherwise why would he be at the Great Council that elected Bran as King? Then again why is Bran, Arya, Brienne (is she Lady of Tarth or did her father Selwyn survive the series?) Davos (he has a castle in Stormlands but he's only a ser, not a lord) and so on there if they aren't a lord or lady?

Other possible wives from show only:
Lady Meera
Lady Yara
Queen Sansa
Gilly (fuck it why not?)
Sam's mum Melassa (milf anyone?)
Lollys Stokeworth (that would be hilarious if he ended up back with her?)

The theory is that Tyrion is the Three Eyed Crow. First, he has the bloodlines and genes (Targaryen etc) for it which would give him special abilities that may have manifest more so in him in some ways. Second, from a baby onwards this guy has been abused, disrespected, rejected etc by everyone it seems which has to have a profound psychological effect on a person especially when it comes from family. And Tywin is at the source of this; he scared Tyrion more than anyone else, he was his monster in a way. Tyrions mere presence makes people uncomfortable and awkward and everyone always trying to crush his spirit and stop him from dreaming.  This experience has warped his personality and mind deep in his psyche, because on the surface he seems hes just a drunk and a whore. Couple that with high intelligence, that type of trauma can cause serious issues. As a child and he had plenty of time to read and study about everything from religion to animals. I believe during this time he may have delved into magic and the like and possible discovered something about himself that hes told no one. Between wild dreams of dragons and a weirwood tree at Casterly Rock along with his studies and all that time to hone his skills, who knows what he truly knows when he says ""I drink and I know things."" I certainly think theres more to him than meets the eye; other characters in the book do to.

With that said, its not well organized and kind of a dump but i hope the point is made well enough. I tried to eliminate anything from show but want people who know the books well to chime in, not people who watched the show.

&amp;#x200B;

\--Tyrion is Aerys II Targaryen's son who through Aegon V and Betha Blackwood has both Targareyn and Blackwood (which seems a bit everywhere and is of certain interest) and Brax, Marbrand, Webber and Prester (female lines) mixed with the Lannisters. Perhaps all this Blood, or at leaste some of it, in one person could be interesting, combining to form something unique perhaps. I dont know enough about Valeryian, First Men, Children's blood, Greenseer, Warg abilities etc to say for sure but seems its a part of it. Hes been a warped mind in the making in esp. in regards to his family . And quotes from and about Tyrion showing his character, mentality, ability and possible future which tie into the overall narrative being suggested. Bloodraven did a lot of wild stuff and he too had Targaryen and Blackwood blood. Tyrion had black and green eyes. Shiera Seastar, a Targaryen bastard, had blue and green eyes and was Targaryen and Blackwood as well. She was also known for practicing the dark arts, blood magic, etc.

""In A Dance with Dragons, upon their wedding night, Aerys took certain unwonted liberties during her bedding ceremony, much to Tywins displeasure.

""Ser Barristan Selmy also seemed to corroborate that Aerys took unwanted liberties with Joannaduring herbedding.""""

&amp;#x200B;

\--Tywin has always denied Tyrion, repeatedly, to the day he died. Blames him for Joanna's death, denies Tyrion Casterly Rock, makes him clean the sewers etc, etc. That type of behavior can only be explained by Tywin, either knowing or strongly suspecting, that Tyrion is not his son especially because hes a dwarf and cant hide the fact. Even if he wasnt a dwarf, its likey it would still be an issue. He rejects Tyrion from day one to last, this cannot be overlooked. Quote after quote of rejections and questioning of Tyrion as his son, shit has to be true and more than just about Tyrion being a dwarf.

\--Tyrion has Valyrian and First Men blood. So its possible hes a Greenseer. The trait is descended from the female line of Lann The Clever, who is known for tricking the Casterlys out of the castle.

""Through the female line they \[the Lannisters\] boast of descent from Lann the Clever, the legendary trickster of the Age of Heroes who tricked the members of House Casterly into giving him Casterly Rock\[4\] during the era of the First Men.""

\--ASOIAF Wiki

This is an interesting telling of how its said Lann ""tricked"" the Casterlys:

""Stories differ in the method by which Lann took Casterly Rock from House Casterly.  In the most common version, Lann, having stripped naked and coated  himself in butter, squeezed through a secret cleft in the stone. Once inside he confused the sleeping Casterlys by whispering threats, howling  like a demon, stealing treasures from one brother and placing them in  the bedchamber of another, and rigging traps. Thus, he set the Casterlys  at odds with one another and convinced them their seat was haunted""                                                                                        --ASOIAF Wiki

""Many mythic figures from the Age of Heroes have been linked to Greenseer and warging abilities, especially in the Starks however from what I can find nobody is talking about the possible Greenseer abilities of Lann the Clever, the tale of how he swindled the Casterlys out of Casterly  Rock are unclear but what we do know could possibly link him to  possessing greenseer, warging or some other magical abilities like other figures in the story.

The first mention of him in Eddard VI AGOT, Ned muses on how Lann the  Clever winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly rock with no weapon but his wits.

We know that many people beyond the wall such as Varamyr  Sixskins or Orell use animals to fight their battles and Bran of course  wargs Hodor, so why not Lann the Clever. Each of the telling of his tale  in AWOIAF are remarkably similar to the other skinchangers and greenseers found in the story.

According to the most common version of the tale Lann discovered a secret way inside the rock and once inside he started whispering  threats in the ears of sleeping Casterlys, howling in the darkness like a  demon. In doing this he eventually turned the Casterlys against each  other and they abandoned the rock. These events are explained if Lann the Clever possessed some kind of  greenseer magic. Casterly Rock has a godswood with a twisted weirwood in it (according to Jaime in Jaime I, ADWD). Thus, through the Weirwood  tree, its possible Lann could have whispered the threats and howled like a Demon similar to what Bran does to Eddard in ADWD.""

\--[https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/146955-lann-the-clever-and-greenseer-magic/](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/146955-lann-the-clever-and-greenseer-magic/)

\++Tyrion likely knows all the passages of Casterly Rock, is quite clever and howled like a demon in the rock as a baby.

""No weapon but his wits""...that sound just like Tyrion, as we will see later in opinions of him.

""Howling like a demon""....How Tyrion was described as a baby in the dungeons below. ""Shortly after Tyrion's birth, the Princess of Dorne arrived with her consort and two younger children, Elia and Oberyn Martell. Tyrion was kept out of sight during the visit of the Martells, though he could sometimes be heard howling.""--ASOIAF Wiki

""These events can be explained if Lann the Clever possessed some kind of greenseer magic.""...Which is a way Tyrion would have greenseer magic ablilties.

""A godswood with a twisted weirwood in it (according to Jaime in Jaime I, ADWD).""  A weirwood in Casterly Rock. I doubt Tyrion had no interest in it.

&amp;#x200B;

His teenage years are of interest as well:

""When he was younger, Tyrion used to dream of owning a dragon of his own, going as far as asking his uncles for one as a nameday present. He used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock, and stared at them for hours, pretending they were dragonflame, while he himself was a lost Targaryen princeling, or a dragonlord from Valyria. Sometimes, he imagined that he saw his father or sister burning in the fires. As he grew older, Tyrion would seldom ever dream of dragons, though he would always remain fascinated by them.""                                                        --Tyrion II, ADWD

"" In 289 AC, when he became a man at sixteen, he wanted to take a tour of the nine Free Cities, as his uncles Gerion and Tygett had done. Tywin forbade him to go, and instead, gave him charge of all the cisterns and drains at Casterly Rock. \[\[Tyrion says as much when they need to storm CR and they use them...but it was ultimately a bad move\]\] When Tyrion was eighteen, his uncle Gerion left on a journey for Valyria to recover the ancient Valyrian steel greatsword Brightroar which had once belonged to House Lannister. Lord Tywin forbade Tyrion to go on this journey as well.\[9\]  ""

"" When Cersei married King Robert I Baratheon in 284 AC,\[32\] Tyrion came to King's Landing for the wedding, where he sought out the dragon skulls which had decorated the throne room during the Targaryen reigns ""

\--ASOIAF Wiki

""Tyrion knows so much about dragons, in fact, that in ""A Dance with  Dragons"" he's even asked to write a history of dragons by a boy named  Griff (more on him later).""

""Once, when his uncles asked him what gift he wanted for his nameday, he begged them for a dragon. ""It wouldn't need to be a big one. It could be  little, like I am."" His uncle Gerion thought that was the funniest  thing he had ever heard, but his uncle Tygett said, ""The last dragon  died a century ago, lad."" That had seemed so monstrously unfair that the boy had cried himself to sleep that night.""

\--[https://www.businessinsider.com/tyrion-targaryen-theory-2016-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/tyrion-targaryen-theory-2016-4)

\+++He had more than a keen interest for dragons in connection to his dragon bloodlines. And its curious that he imagined himself a ""Targaryen princling or Valyrian Dragonlord"", both of which me may be, at lest in part. it seems that having valyrian bloodlines is a prerequisite to being able to handle dragons or be close to them, its likely why they did not eat him in the dungeons when he went to unchain them; moreso how do you get the guts to do that if you dont remotely think you have a chance? seems he thought well of his odds so how did he know he could do it? (how do you know you can fly?) Why even take the chance? Dragons have always been associated with knowledge which Tyrion is always been linked with, ""I drink and I know things""--its never elaborated on though. What do you know, bro?!

This is also something that speaks to his blood, and more about dragons:

""In the books, theres a character named Brown Ben Plumm  who claims to have a little Targaryen blood in him. Rhaegal and  Viserion are particularly friendly with Ben, a fact he attributes to his distant Targaryen lineage. Now that weve seen Rhaegal and Viserion be friendly with Tyrion, something similar may be going on.""

""Particularly of note is a conversation with Jon in A Game of Thrones. Tyrion says:

When I was your age, I used to dream of having a dragon of my own. Oh, yes.  Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world  when hes seated on a dragons back. I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they  were dragon fire. Sometimes Id imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister. Dont look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. Youve dreamt the same kind of dreams.""

\--[https://winteriscoming.net/2016/05/06/game-of-thrones-theorycrafting-is-tyrion-lannister-actually-a-targaryen/](https://winteriscoming.net/2016/05/06/game-of-thrones-theorycrafting-is-tyrion-lannister-actually-a-targaryen/)

""Sometimes I'd imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister."" Jon  Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. ""Don't look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. You've dreamt the same kind of dreams."" **""No,"" Jon Snow said,  horrified. ""I wouldn't ""**

\+++How does he know that he dreamed about killing Robb? Has he entered his dreams? If so, did Jon see him? how did he appear to jon in his dream and what happened? who elses dreams has he monitored? Curiously enough, they both have Betha Blackwood as a grandparent--does that mean anything? Also, Jon denied it.

This just speaks to deep deep rooted issues, a troubled, destructive mind that can hide itself. These traits are very key indeed. This reveals the psychological underpinings of Tyrion and the theory at large.

\+++Consider the many psychological issues this guy has/had because of his appearance and treatment. Not only that, his father always denied and denegrated him and is blamed for his Wifes death, who he seemed to truly love and so hurts even more. Society at large, speaks ill of him with all types of rumors and insults. His family hates him but for Jamie. His betrothals are always rejected. This must weigh and effect the deepest parts of a persons identity. Based on the damn who, its easy to assume hes taken it all in some stride, and perhaps he has up to a point but deep down all this could have created a very dangerous perspective in someone as smart and cunning as Tyrion. He didnt have to just drink and whore, seems he was driven to it but it also may have been a helpful cover to a certain degree. Its certain that many people underestimated and dismissed him throughout his life. It seems Tyrion has a sort of split in his personality, but thats another issue. Also, it made me wonder if all his apparent blunders with Dany were miscalculations or intentional.

Points about family and his feeling about Cersi:

""I have never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm. You've ended that. I will hurt you for this. I don't know  how yet, but give me time. A day will come when you think yourself safe  and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and  you'll know the debt is paid.""                     Tyrion to Cersei Lannister

\+++Tryion threatens Cersi and seemingly makes a prophecy of it. Another family member who dedicatedly tired to stress the life out of Tyrion as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets read some quotes by Tyrion about himself and by others of Tyrion:

""Well, my  legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I  prefer to think it is just large enough for mymind. **I have a realistic  grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. Mymindis my weapon**. My  brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and **I have  mymind** **and amindneeds books as a sword needs awhetstone, if it is to keep its edge.**"" Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. ""**That's why I read so much, Jon Snow**.""                                                                                                                                                 --AGOS Tyrion II

\+++Again, Tyrion and mind. Its his weapon and knowledge is his fuel. I wonder what kind of wheatstones hes come across and exactly what kind of edge does he have, want or deem necessary. the following quote may reveal a bit of that edge.

&amp;#x200B;

Prophecy and Shadows:

""Varys: Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less.

Tyrion: So power is a mummer's trick?

Varys: A shadow on the wall, yet shadows can kill. **And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow**.""

""Tyrion: Someone told me that the night is dark and full of terrors. What do you see in those flames?

Moqorro: Dragons. Dragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark. And you. **A small man with a big shadow, snarling in the midst of all**.""

""Like Melisandre, Moqorro can see the future in the flames, though his **predictions are more accurate**.""  --AWOIAF Wiki

\+++This time a prophecy from someone more accurate that Melissandre. ""A small man with a big shadow"" is again stated and i suspect now that the dragons shadow over kings landing in brans vision may perhaps be symoblic of Tyrions ""big shadow being cast--assuming he is truly behind what happened.

""Bowen: You have great thirst for such a small man.

Aemon: Oh, **I think Lord Tyrion is quite a large man. I think he is a giant come among us**, here at the end of the world.""

""**He is a bigger man than he seems**, I think.                       Garlan Tyrell to Sansa Stark

\+++Repeatedly, Tyrion is framed in this light. Since it not in looks or the battlefield he is refereed to like this is must be because of his mind and perceived ability about him. This cannot be coincidence as it is a repeated action but his overall this particular aura of his character is easily missed as he has been so easily dismissed as a whoremonger and lush. The comments dont seem to be made with any sarcasm as well.

""In this thread they list a video in which Elio and Linda talk about an  interview they did with GRRM. When they asked him if he always knew who of Three Eyed Crow was George said he always knew it was connected to the Targaryens.""

\--ValyrianSteelStrat

\+++So based on the Martins comment, its seems possible Tyrion has the qualifications of being the Three Eyed Crow (perhaps the biggest villain?) as he has Targareyn blood from Aerys II. Afterall, what other genetics could create such a ""monster""? Tywin is always angry and suspicious that ""HE"" could have produced Tyrion. It seems he may have not.

There are many instance through out the series of monsters being born when they mix with Targaryens. Tyrion is one of them who survived. And in his survival, hes been made a monster of by most everyone,  so perhaps him as the TEC is a way for him to tap into/work/manipulate Bran for his powers for his own ends so as to have revenge and power over the world that has always tortured him.

&amp;#x200B;

===========================================================================

TEC:

After the fall Bran begin to have dreams of a Weirwood and a Crow. He saw the Crow first:

""When Bran Stark is in a coma after his fall, a crow appears in his dreams and tells  Bran it can teach him to fly. Bran realizes it has three eyes, with the  third eye full of a terrible knowledge. The crow guides him out of his  coma.\[3\] Bran later tells Maester Luwin of another dream, in which the three-eyed crow goes with the boy to the crypts of Winterfell, where he speaks with his sad father, Lord Eddard Stark. Bran has the dream before finding out that Eddard has been executed in King's Landing.""                                                                                                                   --ASOIAF Wiki

\+++The Crow appears to him at his most weak and vulnerable state and guides him out of the coma. This is a manipulative move and shows that the crow wants/needs something from him and is willing to ""help"" Bran in order to get it. Why Bran? His abilities. Also, the crow showing him his dads death before it happens goes to the crows credibility for Bran to begin listening to the crow. Which he seems to willingly do.

**(2)** As a general rule I think Tyrion likes more people when they are in a position of  vulnerability or when they surprise him. Notice that when Jon answers back to Tyrion's zings he's still in a vulnerable position, with only  Ghost's notable exception. But by then, they both know each other a bit  more.

\--[https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/97j3xv/spoilers\_extended\_the\_unbalanced\_relationsh](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/97j3xv/spoilers_extended_the_unbalanced_relationship/)ip

When was Euron visited? Was he also in a vulnerable state, open to being compromised? Afterall a similar situation happened between him and Bran with the TEC.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion and Jon at the Wall:

""Lessons and failings

Heres  the thing: both guys like each other. Outcasts stick together, and  Tyrion can be a funny and nice guy when hes in the moodespecially  when hes with people he likes. (2)

On the other side, **Jon** is a cool guy and he never disrespects people unless they are complete  sacks of suet like Jonos Slynt or Alliser Thorne. Tyrion, not being used  to niceness, grows unexpectedly fond of the kid. A kid that **needs a wake-up call,** of course (3) ***a wake-up call Tyrion is glad to provide.***

&gt;""**Never forget what you are**, for surely the world will not. **Make it your strength.** Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.""

And Jon gets it: Tyrions lessons are as valuable as it gets, and Jon, real sponge as far as lessons go, absorbs everything.

Heres something he took straight from Tyrion:

* The armor

&gt;""Bastard."" ""Guilty. Of that, at least.""

The  trend continues when Jon Snow uses Thornes mockery as an armor, until  it becomes a sort of compliment. Lord Snow was supposed to be mocking his being a bastard and few books later, heres Jon being regarded as a Lord. But for real

&gt;""Lord Snow,"" Maester Aemon called out, ""I left a book for you in my chambers. The Jade Compendium.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Lord Snow?"" Clydas peered at him closely with his dim pink eyes. ""Are you  unwell? You seem ""

Hardly surprising, **every mockery term Jon receives becomes his.**  Crow, mockery by wildling standards, becomes Lord Crow. And Jon makes  his, because hes truly of the Nights Watch. Same goes for Bastard of  WInterfell, since he ultimately refuses Stannis offer for  legitimization.

* Never forgetting who you are

This is why Jon stays true and doesnt accept Stannis offer, for example.

Also, check Jons inner thoughts:

&gt;Kill the boy, Jon thought. The boy in you, and the one in him. Kill the both of them, you bloody bastard.

""The Monster

***Tyrion corrupts Jon Snow***. In a proper Lord Wotton fashion, Tyrion mold Jon Snow / Dorian Gray. And as in the *Portrait*, what Tyrion says wounds Jons soul and will show up through the rest of the series.

&gt;Sometimes  I'd imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister."" Jon Snow was  staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion  guffawed. ""Don't look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret.  You've dreamt the same kind of dreams."" ""No,"" Jon Snow said, horrified.  ""I wouldn't ""

***Tyrion doesnt believe Jon, but he is wrong***. Jon loves his family. When Tyrion  dreams about killing his relatives, the only one he feels somehow sorry  for is Jamie. And even then, the text isnt completely explicit. Unlike  Tyrion, Jon always feels bad for his dreams concerning Robb, and imo  thanks to Tyrions insinuating the seed of doubt.

Feelings  or not, ***Jons need for validation is an open wound and Tyrions there  with the salt.*** Tyrions words start Jons darker feelings will show up from time to time.

***Its curious to  notice that ultimately the one to wipe away Jons darker desires will  be exactly a character who was hostile to Tyrion, Ghost***!

&gt;Why did he attack me?"" Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf.  He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand.  ""Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.""

Books later, Ghost saves Jons conscience just before he takes his decision concerning Stannis' offer.

&gt;Red  eyes, Jon realized, but not like Melisandre's. He had a weirwood's  eyes. Red eyes, red mouth, white fur. Blood and bone, like a heart tree.  He belongs to the old gods, this one. And he alone of all the direwolves was white. Six pups they'd found in the late summer snows,  him and Robb; five that were grey and black and brown, for the five  Starks, and one white, as white as Snow. He had his answer then.

\--[https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/97j3xv/spoilers\_extended\_the\_unbalanced\_relationship/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/97j3xv/spoilers_extended_the_unbalanced_relationship/)

\+++Ive bold-italicized the parts i found of interest. I suspect Tyrion may be at the wall to ""seduce"" or otherwise ""check out"" Jon. I dont think he corrupts jon as much as he is testing him. Probably in hopes that he violates his own code. If he is willing to do that, perhaps hes willing to do more. Tyrion giving him advice that he himself doesnt take just means that hes trying to see something in Jon but its eerily similar to other comments. ""Tyrion corrupts Jon Snow"", thats exactly what he tryin to see if he can do.  Afterall he seems to have already entered his dreams.

This guys analysis makes sense to me because they are not as buddy-buddy as it seems on the surface and he points out subtle yet important dynamics in their relationship. As far as validation and salt, its spot on. Is this not manipulation in a moment of weakness, doubt, confusion? but to what end? Perhaps the same end the TEC had for Bran and Euron, but he knows he needs a certain type of person to control--recruits. The TEC visited Jojen when he nearly died and was physically and emotionally compromised and seems to be using him to futher its own agenda. In regards to the comments about Ghost, Ghost and the others do this because they sense darkness in Tyrion but for some reason the Starks etc cannot, at least not with any conviction.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion was likely alone plenty as a child and teen and dream of dragons, start fires and wish he was burning 2 of the people he hated the most, Tywin and Cersi. Hes had plenty of situations and time to think, think, think throughout his life; how else would he ""...know things""? as is suggested. The issue is what exactly does he know? What does he intend to do with that knowledge. He certainly has as big a grude as anyone in the series. Hes not just a dwarf in the book, the pretty hard to look at as well. Between having a potent mix of bloodlines, being a dwarf and ""monster"", being known for reading--knowing things, a facination with dragons, hatred of his family and a resentment towards society in general for their cruelty, a weirwood tree at casterly rock, lighting fires, know for his cunning and smarts etc., this makes it possible that he has a certain kind of knowledge that his more notorious characteristics cover up. And through all that trauma has been shaped into something ""terrible"" no one can see. Who would know let alone suspect that hed have this kind of ability and will to power? Hes a monster, afterall. But hes got the blood, the trama, the self-control, and the knowledge--""full of terrible knowledge.""

We dont know how long the TEC has existed or how it exists just that TEC is an avatar in dreams with a sinister agenda. Who or what it represents exactly is up in the air and allows for all sorts of predictions.

Lets be clear, Tyrion is not the good guy. Hes much more ambiguous and i believe full of rage and darkness. Its this darkness and his character that leads me to think hes the TEC--its a manifestation of the knowledge and power he has gained throughout his life. All the hatred, insult, abuses of every kind by everyone esp his family. Essentially, hes on some Palpatine type stuff.

George RR Martin was interviewed by Amazon.com and stated:

&gt;Interviewer: Do you have a favorite character?Martin: Ive got to admit I kind of like Tyrion Lannister. Hes the villain of course, but hey, theres nothing like a good villain. [Amazon.com Interview with GRRM, 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/19991013131915/http://cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/martin.html)

In regards to the Direwolves behavior towards Tyrion...

""Why did he attack me?"" Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the Direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his  hand. ""Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.""

\++Ghost also snapped at Tyrion on the Wall. Summer, Ghost, Shaggy, and Grey Wind all had this reaction to him at Winterfell. I think the Direwolves have their own assessments as well. They dont just only react of their owners feelings, its something more about how they individually and as a group feel about Tyrion as as opposed to their owners. I think it speaks to his ""hidden powers"" that they sensed and disturbed them enough to attack; he was a threat and they responded like it but no one else could see the exact nature of it.

(Something else also happened in regards to his reaction that may be suggestive in regards to his personality and anger. As an example of this self control i mentioned, i noticed this when Ghost attacks him at the Wall with Jon, ""Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and **crushed it out with a will**."" Thats interesting wording. Why say it like that? It may mean nothing but it may show a certain kind of self control and ability to hide his deeper feelings/intents which would be helpful were he ""up to something"" or ""more than he seems"". He did not get over it, brush it aside, overlook, or dismiss it somehow; he crushed it with a will, not a line of thought, after some time, later...instantly and unquestioningly. The control he seeks cannot be had without controlling the self. This seems good, even reasonable, but if his motive is power this is a very dangerous frame of mind to have as it can be very effective. What else can Tyrion crush or otherwise do with a will?)

Jon has a dream about Bran:

""Jon?

The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too. Can a shout be silent?  He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean  grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only

A weirwood.

It seemed to sprout from  solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and  hairline cracks. The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods  he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched,  its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky. Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face. Red eyes looked at him.  Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him. The weirwood had his brother's face. Had his brother always had three eyes?

*Not always*, came the silent shout. *Not before the crow*.

He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but **behind that there were  other scents,** the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell  of stone and **something else, something terrible. Death, he knew. He was smelling death. He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.**

\-*-Don't be afraid, I* ***like it in the dark. No one can see you, but you can see them***\*. But first you have to open your eyes. See? Like this.\* And the tree reached down and touched him.""

\--""The strongest trees are rooted in the dark places of the earth. **Darkness will be your cloak, your shield, your mother's milk. Darkness will make you strong**.the three-eyed crow, to [Bran Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bran_Stark)

\--""Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are  the rest of the world will not. **Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you**...All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.""

\++Jon saw Bran with three eyes. By then he had accessed or began to to this ""terrible knowledge"". The quote used the same word, terrible, but its associated with Bran in the tree even though there is a distinction of tree, boy, and death. That terrible knowledge may very well leave a stench on those you use, access or otherwise are associated with it--it seems it would change someone in a fundamental way. Could this be the same or a related reason that the Direwolves behaved this way towards Tyrion?

\++The TEC, Bran, and Tyrion use very similar language concerning ""darkness"" and ""armor"". Tyrions comment to Jon seems helpful but it can be taken another way because doing that can produce negative consequences as well. Which is why i think Tyrion is testing Jon at the Wall. It speaks to Jons vulnerability as well and Tyrions sense of it.

The End.

Q.    So, big battle coming up. Are you nervous?
A.    Dont get nervous. We know its our time. We have put in the work, got our chain of command tight, lots of good fighters out there. Overwhelming numbers, tactical superiority, patience, no supply chain, solid recruiting process. Bring it.
Q.    Winterfell is a tough nut to crack.
A.    Oh, please. They have some walls, but need I remind you of what happened to the last wall? You guys and your walls. Sheesh. 
Q.    Speaking of that. You just want to, you know, kill everybody? Why so cruel? 
A.    Cruel? Why do you think my army is so big? Those arent old men out there. All prime-of-life guys, solid fighters. Howd they get dead? Oh, I admit, we have, uh, converted our share, but when we started this gig we were working exclusively with corpses provided by you guys.
Q.    Yes, but death! Death? 
A.    What are you even on about? Do these guys look dead to you? (gestures at his escort)
Q.    Well, yes. 
A.     Fair point. Let me rephrase. Are they walking around?
Q.    Definitely.
A.    Menacing you with old rusty weapons and lances of ice?
Q.    Yes. I meant to mention that.
A.    How dead can they be? Your dead people, are they walking around, getting satisfaction from serving their country, getting all the plunder they want, camaraderie, songs around the...well, songs on the road? 
Q.    (shrugs) Well, I guess you have a point there.
A.    That poncy lord, always all over the place, funny name...Littlefinger. Arya just aced him, he gurgled out on the stones of the Great Hall. Great stuff, how they trapped him. Anyway, wheres he at? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?
Q.    What? Quillets? And how did you know about him?
A.    Never mind. That dude is dead for good. 
Q.    Yes, but...is that really good for them? A mindless army of rotting corpses? 
A.    Dont forget the bears and horses. Im very proud of the bears and horses.
Q.    Theres more bears?
A.    (chuckles.) Tons.
Q.    OK. Uh, well, sure. Horses and bears too.
A.    Those guys you got? Wildlings, random Starks and Carstarks and Greenstarks and Hastacks and whatever, the Dothrakis, the Lannisters--nice uniforms, by the way--you are telling me you think those guys arent just the same? Grunts. Cannon fodder. Cheap extras. Did you see the dragon burn them? You pick: burned alive by dragon fire, or a nice clean arrow stroke and bing! youre up again. Plus Donderrion? You have some zombies of your own.
Q.    OK. So, you are a pretty scary SOB. I mean, blue skin, blue eyes, cool tight armor. But some of our American watchers are saying, you seem to have a kind of devil thing working. Shape of the face, glowering baleful stare, and the little horns, right? 
A.    (shaking head, exasperated). Those guys. Devils everywhere. Get horny, see a devil. Thats one thing well be changing in the new world order. I got the least horny army in history, and they dont get worked up about devils.
Q.    But the horns. I can see them, right there.
A.    No horns. Thats the crown. Night Kings crown is kind of melted in. Like a fraternity initiation thing. 
Q.    Oh. OK. But the walk, thats, I gotta say, thats good stuff. Scary, man. Very effective. Stalking along, shoulders rolling a bit, chin down, swinging arms. Thats something.
A.    Leadership. Thats leadership, man. Your average dead soldier, he doesnt need much. OK, he doesnt need anything. But he wants a leader. You got to cultivate the look, right? I worked on that for years. 
Q.    So its contrived?
A.    (shrugs) Who doesnt? With you guys, its outfits. I got to admit, some of that stuff is badass. Sansa, with her dominatrix line? Gets the blood flowing. If you have blood, anyhow.
Q.    So what are your influences?
A.    Youll laugh.
Q.    No, I promise.
A.    OK. Mainly, Prince. But also that guy from Apocalypse Now, colonel Kilgore? Napalm in the morning guy. He had the walk, mortars all around. I saw that at a hard time when I was young and all alone. Im like, thats going to be me someday. 
Q.    Very effective. 
A.    You like it? You see Snow at Hardhome? Fuckin rivetted. I practice that, right? Get some dead guys, slow lift of the arms, up they come. Those wall guys, in the boats? I could see their balls shriveling. 
Q.    Not just them.
A.    I have been working on a line: I love the smell of no smell in the winter!
Q.    Hmm. Are they going to put it in?
A.    Naah. No lines for me. Its all about the money. You have lines, you get residuals. Thats OK--Ill have more work after this. Ive had some offers. The industry knows I developed the look.
Q.    But...Emmies for makeup, pretty much every year. Not you.
A.    Non-prosthetic! Non-prosthetic! 
Q.    OK, ok, non-prosthetic. I get it. 
A.    (grumbles)
Q.    Did you see what Clegane said? 
A.    No, didnt see that. I dont read the tabloids.
Q.    Can I read it to you? 
A.    Absolutely. Cant wait.
Q.    He called you a skinny-arm turtleneck-looking twat. 
A.    (silence) 
Q.    Get to you a bit?
A.    Gotta admit, thats a good one. I dont get a lot of arm work. Sometimes you have to choose.
Q.    OK. But let me ask you: all the dead, the hordes, killing everything. How can you justify that?
A.    Weve been over this. One of your guys said it best: We were at war. 
Q.    Yes, but...Wait. How did you know that? That just happened, inside Winterfell! You must have spies there. Its Arya, isnt it? I knew it!
A.    No, no. I mean, Id love to have her, but no. Shes yours. I dont need spies. Just watch the show.
Q.    You watch the show? 
A.    Hell yes! Who wouldnt? Your enemies, bunch of cameras, pretty good audio, complete access, all their innermost conversations, tactics, plans, despair, courage, a little something-something--youd think theyd be a bit more careful.
A.    Hadnt thought of that. 
Q.    I mean, you have to do a lot of filtering. Theres a lot of flashbacking, yammering about honor and so on,  and whats with freaking Tyrion and songs? Hes supposed to be so smart, and he wants to hear barroom singing.
Q.    Hes vulnerable.
A.    Ill say. Speaking of vulnerable--all that pathetic dragonglass. I cant wait to see the look on Tarleys face--before his face rots away, of course--when he learns the dragonglass was bullshit. No, I cant wait to see the look on all the people when they realize that their secret weapon is, well, just black glass. Theyre trading a lot of good ordnance for stuff with the cutting power of a broken Fiestaware plate.
Q.    Wait, the dragonglass doesnt work? 
A.    Naah. I mean, about as well as anything that holds an edge. Not as well as forged steel.
Q.    But we saw, white walkers, going down from just one little stab. Thats not real?
A.     Standing orders. Anybody hits you with the glass, you die. Make it big, right? Psy ops. You guys? Just not too smart. You think soldiers in the army of the dead mind dying? 
Q.    Well. Thats a big surprise, I must say. What about Valyrian steel?
A.    Well, thats a bit more of a problem. But its not Valyrian steel. And its not just Valyrian steel, either. Any quality product, were suckers for it. You know that beautiful black marble from Essos?
Q.    Yes! Dragon Tears, they call it. Fantastic. My sister has a countertop.
A.    Nice! Long counter? 
Q.    Kitchen island and main counters. 300 square feet, give or take.
A.    Wow. Quite an investment. Beveled edge, or straight?
Q    Straight. Angled corners, too.
A.    Good. I cant abide a bevel on dark marble. Anyway, we came on a shipwreck once, up there where thewell, you wouldnt know it. Bunch of guys, Bravosi, blown off course, huddled ashore, freezing, starving, you know the drill. We ride up. Usual scene, terror, slaughter, a lot of stalking around. End of it all Im standing there, I realize my cousin Dieter isnt there. I look over, sure enough, hes a bunch of cubes. What the hell, Im thinking. I mean, Dieters no loss, but who in that bunch could have done him? What do you know--theres one guy, still alive. Fuckers holding a marble rolling pin. Not just any marble--Dragons Tears. Best there is. Dieter, that dumbass, didnt recognize it and walked right into it. 
Q.    Rolling pin.
A.    Rolling pin.
Q.    But Tarley, he got one of you, dragon glass--right? We all saw it.
A.    Yeah, I know. Wasnt the dragon glass. He was wearing a woolen shift from Tilemouth. Like silk, finest weave youve ever seen. They got that shit down, man. More sheep than people, and good sheep, too.
Q.     Tarley killed one of your guys with a t-shirt? 
A.    Well, I wouldnt put it like that. But, yeah. Pretty much.
Q.    So, Valyrian steel, Essos marble
A.    Those little nesting dolls, those are so fun! Down in the Riverlands they make lovely grasspaper. Any good laquerware from Dorn will do it. Jeweled brooch from the Diyavans got one of my wifes brothers once. 
Q.    Youre married? 
A.    Well, were kind of on a break. 
Q.    On a break. 
A.    Yeah. Can I tell you?
Q.    Wait, no. Oh, no. Please. Dont do it.
A.    No, its very sincere. Real problem. 
Q.    Dont say it. I dont want to know. Ill edit it out, I swear.
A.    She thinks Im frigid.
Q.    Damn it.
A.    Get it? 
Q.    Yes. I get it. So no marriage?
A.    Oh, no. Im married. Were on a break.
Q.    Maybe well come back to that. So, any special tactics we can expect at Winterfell?
A.    I can tell you what I wont be doing.
Q.    OK.
A.    Letting Arya fucking flip-face Stark anywhere near me looking like a dead guy. Or even being a dead guy. 
Q.    Never thought of that.
A.    Well, I did. When youre dead, and hang out with the dead a lot, you sometimes forget theyre there, you know? Not this time. Ill be keeping an eye out for that little bitch.
Q.    Well, that closes one plot possibility very neatly.
A.    Bank on it. I am tempted to go for Brandon, though. I hate that bastard. 
Q.    OK, then. Why so down on Brandon?
A.    I just dont like his face.
Q.    Wait, what?
A.    Pisses me off. Blank dull unfocused stare, always just sitting there. Thats my gig. Plus the Raven thing. Dudes out to lunch. I think he spelled Raven wrong. (giggles)
Q.    I got nothing.
A.    Hes on my list. 
Q.    Good one.
A.    I have a long list.
Q.    Whos on it?
A.    Everybody.
Q.    Me?
A.    (shrugs) Nah. I respect the press too much.
Q.    (silence)
A.    Just kidding, dude. Hate the press. But you can stay alive.  Ill take care of you. No point in killing you. What the fuck good would you be dead? Look at this, Q and A format, lightly edited for quality. I could tell you anything and youd write it down and put it on Insta. Ive got you already. Youre my zombie bitch. No, I want soldiers. Army of the Dead doesnt have a PR office.
Q.    Obviously.
A.    What was that?
Q.    Nothing. Do you think you can take Brienne? 
A.    Look, Im a modern general. Nobodys baiting me into single combat or whatever. Brienne is impressive, and shes right about the left flank, so I have some very complex tactical maneuvers planned for that part of the field. You want to know what the plan is?
Q.    Of course.
A.    Swarm the motherfuckers. During the battle youll be able to identify Brienne of Tarth because shell be the extra-tall pile of swarming corpses. 
Q.    Oh. Uh, makes sense. So. Next question. What if they retreat to the Iron Islands. A pretty obvious bit of pre-plotting there. They could hold out there for years, ships and all, maybe head south? Winter is coming and all. 
A.    (shakes his head). Yeah, sure. 
Q.    You dont think so? Its so obvious! The dead cant swim!
A.    This isnt even a challenge. Its too easy. When we did the giants, that was a real war. Those sumbitches are big. 
Q.    Hang on. The dead can swim?
A.    Well, no. Not the dead, not us either. I can skate a bit.
Q.    So Jon is right? Some of us were thinking a strategic defeat might be the ticket to the next season.
A.    Next season? Well, I know who will have a fat contract if that goes down. But no, well end it this time. No next season, because the dead can swim.
Q.    You just said they cant.
A.    Men cant. You ever heard of whales? Sharks? Smart mothafucking dolphins with bombs on their heads? I can do men, I can do horses, I can do a freaking dragon, you think I cant do a battalion of humpback whales with a screen of narwhal cavalry? If the Northerners retreat to the islands, they can bloody stay there, but they wont be sailing anywhere anytime soon. Rest of us will go south. 
Q.    You are evil.
A.    You keep saying that. Plenty of evil to go around. The North Remembers. Bullshit. YOu know what we call The North?
Q.    No, what?
A.    The South! Get it? Listen, winter is coming. Has anybody thought about this? Pink Breathers down there with their plants and their hot pies and all that, living their life, a lot of raping and stabbing and blowing up and so on. Its summer all the time. Guess what: summer makes you weak. Now, its our turn. Winter is here, baby. Thats our season. Show me a horde of half-naked Dothraki with their stupid sickle swords and Ill show you a bunch of shivering bastards who dont feel like riding fast in their assless chaps, standing up on their saddles. Who says its supposed to be summer all the time? Fair is fair. We like winter. Feels good on our exposed bones.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I know most of them didn't, but for the life of me I can't figure out why any of them remained.

Following Dany goes against their entire culture and she hadn't even done anything to earn enough respect for them to defy their own nature. At that point, all she had done was stop them from raping and pillaging - something that obviously wouldn't earn their friendship.

I can understand why the women might have wanted to follow her, but certainly not the men. And I don't even understand why the women were allowed to follow her - as slaves they should have been forced to follow one of the two new Khals.

Its irritating and unsatisfying, but not because it doesn't make sense. It is unsatisfying because it shows us something we already know.

The joy in a good TV show like Game Of Thrones is that it shows us something that makes sense, but we did not believe was possible. The pleasure behind discovering new dimensions in a good story is the same pleasure as discovering deep truths about ourselves and the world we inhabit. We discover whats possible, but its always stranger and more wonderful than we could ever have imagined.

In season one when Ned was beheaded, it was violent, shocking and completely unexpected. But this is not what made it great.  The reason we were so shocked to see Ser Ilyn Payne axe his head is because it uncovered a deep truth about the world of Game of Thrones. It showed us something that was always possible, but that we did not believe until it happened. This one scene revealed that the game of thrones is more sinister and more dangerous than we could have ever imagined. It completely changed our understanding of the nature of the show we are watching, and cast our beloved characters into a new savage world where nothing is certain.

What makes a good scene, however, is also what makes it unrepeatable. The fact that Westeros is more savage than we originally expected is the very reason an axed head cannot be shocking again. We have already learned that truth, and we cannot learn it again. This reality that was once stranger and more deadly than we originally expected is no longer stranger and more deadly. It is just strange and deadly.

Danny's decision is disappointing not because it doesn't make sense, but rather because it does not show us something we did not already know was possible. There is no nuance under her character arc that is revealed by bringing fire and blood. We learn nothing new about her, or the world she inhabits. All we are shown is what we already know is possible. And to make things worse, we aren't even told why she made one choice, and not another.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The simple ones knowledge is that when a beast or animal bonds with a man, the man receives some of the properties of the beast. That way the bravest and strongest man will become a coward, when being inside a deer for too long. In reverse, the nicest and kindest man will become barbaric when staying inside a wolf for too long. Dragons on the other hand are kind of balances for the ones who connected to them. They do not have a personality at first. The first one to bond with them gives the personality to them. That way the dragon acts like you. But therefore, grounds the person who is connected to that personality. That way many Tagarions who lived with Aegons dragon, the black dread, were calm, collected and humble. When the dragons died out, these trades died out too. And in its place the insanity made room for itself. Now when a beast dies while connected to a human, a piece of the rider dies with it, but the beast will live in the riders head for some time, before the memories merge into one consciousness. Even the dead dragons beneath Dragonstone did its due. Every owner of the castle became much quieter and much more thoughtful, even though the dragons never had contact with the man living there ever after. But not only positive things came to the people living in Dragonstone. The smaller dragons always lived in fear, to be eaten by the bigger ones and therefore developed a suspicious nature. They were so small, that when they died, nobody noticed and their bones were still lying in the corners, on the support beams and everywhere, where nobody would clean for centuries.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

**The Future in a Dream**

While Valyria was the greatest city there is and ever will be of the known world, many so called dragon riders protected the city. No famous people, just one of the many with no name or special heritage. Not one was remembered by the books of the citadel. They were soldiers. One could only imagine what kind of live they had. Living in the wealthiest city of the world, protecting it, being respected and in company of dragons. And after the doom of Valyria everyone, everything and every dragon was gone. The knowledge of how to build cities like that, lost. The only survivors the world knows of, are the Tagarions. They left the city after one of the daughters had a dragon dream, looking in the future and seeing what would happen. After a few generations of prosperous trading, this family, which wasnt in any way or form powerful became the most powerful family of the Westeros.

But as the citadel tells this story and everybody knows this story is just that. A tale of doom. Something parents tell the children to scare them, just a story, we tell ourselves over and over until we forget that its a lie! Or is it?

The tale of the Doom 

The Valyrian were in the wrong and the world revolted. Some believe it was the spirit of the Roine, which revolted against the oppression of the native people in the proximity of the river, who took it as their god. When the Valyrian poisoned the river, killing the natives the spirit made sure this wouldnt happen again. Others believe, that it was the biggest dragon who died in captivity and couldnt become what he came from. Dragons are fire made flesh. When a dragon cannot become fire again, he will develop gasses and if they catch fire no dragon would survive the firestorm. Thats the way the citadel describes the doom. But what really happened only the ones responsible new.

Left to grow strong by itself it grew too strong to control. Like the undying were saying: magic is the strongest in proximity of dragons, and there were many dragons. Since magic was so prominent, in that time, not only respected but searched for, the sorcerers in the black tower used blood magic, to get more powers, the rest of the word wouldnt even dream of. Using the blood of human children, dragons and animals, they created their own enclave in the city, where nobody was physically able to get in without having their seal of approval. At first, they were supposed to protect the city. They did, they had success doing it, and becoming more powerful, every time they did. Using the blood of the slain armies, they made themselves immortal. Even the most powerful families in the city wouldnt dare to speak up to them, fearing the consequences, involving living sacrifices. Not of animals but of their suns and daughters. With nobody to keep them in check, they grew too strong. 

Since the mages kept everybody sort of save, there was not much to do for the new generation of dragon riders. Earlier while the city grew in size and not in height, others, jealous of the riches of the city, dared to attack the city and were fought back by the dragon riders. They were true heroes. Defending the city, living for the city and dying for it.

The simple ones knowledge is that when a beast or animal bonds with a man, the man receives some of the properties of the beast. That way the bravest and strongest man will become a coward, when being inside a deer for too long. In reverse, the nicest and kindest man will become barbaric when staying inside a wolf for too long. Dragons on the other hand are kind of balances for the ones who connected to them. They do not have a personality at first. The first one to bond with them gives the personality to them. That way the dragon acts like you. But therefore, grounds the person who is connected to that personality. That way many Tagarions who lived with Aegons dragon, the black dread, were calm, collected and humble. When the dragons died out, these trades died out too. And in its place the insanity made room for itself. Now when a beast dies while connected to a human, a piece of the rider dies with it, but the beast will live in the riders head for some time, before the memories merge into one consciousness. Even the dead dragons beneath Dragonstone did its due. Every owner of the castle became much quieter and much more thoughtful, even though the dragons never had contact with the man living there ever after. But not only positive things came to the people living in Dragonstone. The smaller dragons always lived in fear, to be eaten by the bigger ones and therefore developed a suspicious nature. They were so small, that when they died, nobody noticed and their bones were still lying in the corners, on the support beams and everywhere, where nobody would clean for centuries. 

**Sherine** 

While flying, far over the highest towers of the city, something was of. The air was too flat, there were no birds and all the dragons were nervous. This nervous behavior normally came only up when a wild dragon gets near the baby dragons. And then only the baby dragons seem to feel that way. The dragons felt that a massive danger was making its way to Valyria. The most dragon rider went down to the ground to report the eminent danger to the mages, they should know what is going on. Every dragon except one was now down. Sirius, a rider who was trained with me, still many years older than me shouted at me: Come down, you may at least make some good impressions for the noble boys down there. They probably dont even know, that you exist, and that would be too sad. A rich family with slaves My squint made him stop. Im sorry, I forgot, but Id bet, you would be a better master than all of them bitching and whining girls of the noble families, and Im betting with you, when they see you, you wont have a single minute of time alone. I shook my head. First of all, I dont want anybody who just wants me because of my looks, I want to know him or her, Im ok with both I winked at him And if there is a serious danger coming, I want to be up here. I want to see whats going on. And if not, well I had some alone time with Merisax. Something I value more than a big house with slaves! Now he shook his head: Ok ok, I get it. Well then, we will see each other in the barracks. He was always that ignoring of danger. Thats what I liked about him. He was the only one who could get me of the wall, when I was upset, sad or angry. He would come to me, even when everybody was leaving me. He, his dragon, Serion and Merisax were the only ones I cared for in this godforsaken city. Even though this city had something worth living in. I shouted: I bet on it! and then quiet And good luck for the wars to come.  The explosion hit the city, when I was high in the air, but it reached us in mere seconds. We both fell, ripped out of the clouds, like ripe fruits. I closed my eyes. Trying to stay calm and let my dragon reclaim security. She felt my trust into her, but she wasnt able to perform. I felt her pain, her sorrow, that she wouldnt be able to protect me like the years past. The only thing she was able to do was to slow my fall. She protected me my fall was soft, but my head hit something hard and everything went black. What happened to her, I couldnt tell.   

When I woke up, the only thing I could remember, was that the firestorm came from the highest city tower. The place, where the mages conducted their experiments. Blodmagic. Forbidden in any other city but thriving in Valyria. They had overdone it this time. After the explosion nothing was standing anymore, only ruins and the smell of burned flesh. Nothing, no dragons no human no beast no animal. Nothing had survived the doom except of me. Because my dragon saved me.

**Chapter One:**

I had to do. No people to report to, no one to talk to, I panicked. I screamed for help, but the only thing that screamed back was the deafening silence. I wondered aimless through the city, hoping to find someone or at least something that could remind me of what I and everybody lost in this city, being it the humanity, the people of Valyrira lost a long time ago or in my case, my dragon, my friends my home. 

While searching the blasted ruins of my home for something useful, I came across the places. Before, I was only able to dream, of entering it.  One of the great city-halls. The place where only the high lords made their business, where nobody but the finest people would be. Something told me not to go there. If it was fear or something else, I couldnt tell. Not minding these bad feelings, I made my way up the 500 stairs of now blacked marble. It was a stunning sight, just minutes before, now the towers are gone, blasted away, the white, almost blinding sight was gone. Everything was just dark, blackened by the fire. The ornaments watched me with a strange look in their eyes. The bodies had been melted down by the fire. The cracking heat, formed the stone figures, bowed their neck, in an unnatural and unconvertable way. I entered through the main forte. The big doors were blasted open. But I realized, that the grate hall was in quite decent condition. No cracking stone inside, no burned pillows only a few dark spots on the floor. I stepped close to one of these stains, so I could see what these were. They were burned man and women, who tried to run inside. I could see the gems of their clothes sparkle through the ashes and crumbling bones. A Breeze swirled the ashes up and let the bones fall to dust. The air in the room had a burned flavor. It was bitter, and even though Ive seen and smelled much worse, I vomited. I didnt realize what fire could do to a body. Ironic coming from a dragonrider, but I was never in a battle before, nor had my dragon ever killed someone with fire. I ran through the main hall, trying to evade the still smoking piles of body dust of the recently deceased. A small room was my save haven. It was the place where all the guardians of the city were lying, who died defending exactly that. Now for noting, I guess I thought. Still the graves draw me to them. I wandered past the newest graves. Gerriues was the last one. He fell from a horse and broke his neck, after riding a dragon for 50 years. It must have been a bad joke for his family, that he was buried here. Visible for everybody. The next one was Cassius the fierce, Tassius, Cassandra the just, the graves reach back to Drius the defender, the first, who climbed a dragon, the first dragon rider and first hero of the city. Probably not the first one who died for the city, but the first hero. At least in the stories the trainers told. He wielded a Valyrian steel sword. This sword does not corrode, doesnt get blunt or damaged. The perfect weapon. I looked at it. The past years I always dreamed of having one of these grate weapons. Its not only an honor to have one, but its the finest blade one could imagine owning. I took it. Took it out of the scabbard and with the thought, that I would bring it to better use than leaving it with the dead, I named it Keeper. As a memory of my dragon, my city and myself and my friend Sirius. So that I would my keep them in good memories.  

I would need to leave the city at one point or the other. I had no supplies and the surrounding was still smoking and burning. The smoke was as dense as a curtain and only let a bit of sun in. 

Since I had too much time doing nothing, I wanted to start doing something. So, I wandered though the city, finding other places which werent that bad damaged. 

The great library was close to be unharmed and the bocks only in a very dry condition. In theory the people should have survived in here but seemingly nobody was here in a while... But since there were places that werent damaged that badly I still had hope to find someone living. Be it a dog, cat or preferable a human. Strangely the silence that fell over Valyria was sort of nice, living in a city where dragons flew over it, roaring, the mines, the forges and all the humans were quiet now. It was like humans never were here in the first place.

I began to read some books but there were some, that caught my attention. Those were about the mages. They were bound in heavy leather, were thick and heavy. They already had me in their ban when I first glanced over them. They had something special about them. Something I couldnt explain but I was drawn to them. They had the power to take lives without any warning. And of cause destroy on a scale no dragon could. Not only was I drawn to the books but also the place they originated. It was the place where the explosion came from. I remembered who was responsible for this genocide of a city of close two million. A city even bigger than Kingslanding while the rain of the mad king. But when I explored the library, read a few books, and put them back, I lost the track of time. When I came out of the massive building, it was already late in the day. The sun hid behind the massive fog and the only thing reminding of its existence was a light glare between the clouds. It was getting darker by every minute.  

Most of the ground was white like snow. Except, it wasnt frozen water, it was the burned remains of the people of the city. It reminded me that I had to get out of the city, as fast as possible. People had to know what the mages had done. They all would have to suffer, what these monsters had done. But first I had to gain vision. And the only place, where I would be able to do so was the tower of the mages. If only one of them would have survived I would behead him right where he stands. 

Before I would have never imagined to be up there. It was the last place a dragon rider would be. As one could represent ones case before the wise rulers, can be named hero of the city and marry a girl or boy of a great family. But to get up the tower, one would have to be chosen by the mages or born as a mage. 

On my way to the tower, I realized, how beautiful the city was. Massive arches, many statures of former important people and beautiful facades. Everything was designed to be as impressive as possible. But I never saw it the way, it is now, before. Either, I was high up, where the smog of the city covered the architecture. Or on the floor, the markets, the people and animals in the city always blocked the view. They covered the beauty by there presence. Now the city was   
 clean,    empty,   dead. 

**Chapter two:**

I realized, that I would have to hurry, to get to the top of the tower, when I wanted to see further then the light of the moon would provide me. I started to jog, passing the house of the masters, I saw chains, chains which were used to hold slaves, now they were holding nothing, not even bones. No, I remembered what I wanted to remind myself, by naming my sword. Keeper I gasped. Remembering the people, I was once part of. Those chains still held something for me! 

The memories of me, the slave of the city, the people, who build, served and died for the city. Turning left, I stated to run. I felt something pushing me, a feeling that someone or something was stalking me, with hungry eyes, it followed me through the ruins of the street. I turned into the street of the builders, an arrogant name, I almost cried out. They only had the best housings, because THEY had them build by the slaves. I waited for a response, but nobody wanted to stop me, so I continued. No wonder the slave masters moved their business right next to them! Earlier I was always stopped by Serion I screamed at the ruins of a mansion. The first time I **really** was frustrated.  

The silence was killing me!

I had a headache from screaming and no water.  

And my sides stung, since I hadnt eaten since morning.

Out of breath I reached one house. But it stood still tall. Not a single window was broken. I stopped. I screamed for someone to come out or I would come in. Nothing, not a single sound was there to hear. 

The silence was annoying me. 

I tried to run the door in. Nothing, the door didnt move a single inch. Another time, nothing, only a dark umpf.  The former owner must have had a mage to protect his home, unfortunately for him, not the owner himself. Ironic, valuing the ownings higher than his own live. I couldnt do anything else but smile Impressing what those mages could do, but it gave me confidence, that I had to hunt every single and last one of them. This fight they may have won, but not the war

Leaving the house behind, passing the street, now sneaking further, I reached the inner tower group. Normally there were guards, not letting anybody through, keep the peasants out, like my sword master would have said. Now I could just go straight past it. The strange feeling overcame me coming again, coming closer to the biggest tower. My breathing normalized, wehn I reached the massive complex. I had shivers running down my spine. I realized, it wasnt only the tower, the highest building in the city, towering over everything, but it was the mages. They didnt want me in their living quarters, fear me away from their experiments. Keep me out of the place, in which I hoped every single and last one of them died. If not, I wouldnt hesitate to do exactly that, what the doom wasnt able to do! 

I stood in front of the main gate. A massive, with steel reinforced wooden double door, made to keep out what wasnt allowed to be inside.  I stared at it for a few seconds. A really heavy door, nonetheless I tried to open it. I imagined myself using every single mussel in my body, but with a single small push. The doors swung wide open and crashed into the wall behind it. A loud BANG echoed inside the building, loosing itself in the ashes around me.

Passing through the gate I entered the first floor. I had to search for the staircase. At first I didnt want to investigate every room to find it but since only the first floor was as big as the whole library, I had to open every single door. In the every single room I found nothing except coles and ashes of the burned, their pets and interieur. After a long search for this dang staircase, I finally found it, but had to rest for a few seconds. This building was huge, the staircase on the other hand was as small as it could be. Small and high stairs, but extremely narrow. Maybe two little children were able to go upstairs next to each other, holding hands. At first, I wanted to investigate into every room in this tower, maybe Id find somebody, I would be able to turn my anger, frustration, sorrow and grief against. Many told me, that these motives were the best motives. These motives will give you strength. They will give you stamina! 

But I just felt miserable. 

I really never cared much for this city. I was born a slave and was supposed to die a slave. If it wasnt for Merisax, saving me from that fate, I would have died in the mines or as a prostitute in one of the many brothels. She saved me by choosing me. She hedged out of the egg, escaped the underground breeding areas and ran straight to me. From that day I was a dragonrider and she never left my side.  If I was inside, she had to be there to, when she grew too big, she just watched me from outside, from a window or somewhere else. She trained with me, hunted with me and fought with me, even if our enemies only were bandits or thieves. 

I missed her 

My thoughts became foggy climbing the stairs. The air wasnt as dense as downstairs. Additionally, the fog, I now realized wasnt fog, it was smoke, forming a dome above the city, and I was slowly climbing into it. The walls became pitch black. Everything was black. The stairs and the stones. I felt wired. Somehow there was a light red glowing. But I didnt know what it was. Suddenly I heard crunching under my feet. Bones. Falling apart like leaves in fall. Not one thought of trying to secure these bones for a burial came to my mind. These People were responsible for the death of millions and my dragon, my friends. Stumbling over bones that werent that brittle, then over still fleshy body parts. There were more people up here than I thought. Weather these people tried to run away from the impending doom or running into it, to shut it down, I could not say. Every step felt wrong. A dark rumbling became every more present, soft vibration in the air were getting hard and forcing my breath to run away from me. This place was empty. No animal was up here, not even a single fly feasting on the corpses. Everything was screaming GET AWAY! But resisting the urge to get as far away as possible I climbed even higher. While the air got thinner, the feeling of danger came closer and closer, I drew my sword, Keeper. Hoping it would protect me, same as my dragon did. The steel was the source of the red glow. It helped. It was not a glow of red hotness. More like blood, that was draining the swords magic and overloaded its capabilities to stay in its form. I never thought blood magic could forge a sword but seemingly thats how valerian steel was made. And how it kept its form for all eternity. 

The floor became sticky, but the grip got worse, a little slippery. There was a smell of metal in the air and the glow of the sword revealed that my surrounding, slowly but steady, changed. From Chole black, to dark red. What ever happened here, it seemed that the people exploded. Their blood, the last thing to be seen from them. There was so much blood, that the stones were drained in it, every gap was filled by it. Even the sealing was colored by it. I just wanted to get down. But close before my survival instincts kicked in, close before I was about to turn around, not wanting to get lost in an invite loop, I reached the top. A heavy metal door stood in my way. It freaked me out. You could see how the men and woman tried to get inside. The Shadows of their bodies were still there. The last thing what existed of these people were their shadow. The protection of their bodies was visible on the metal. It got weakened at the points where the heat hit it without flesh, ribs and bones in the way and it started to peel off the door. Still a heavy door, I thought, I would never be able to get inside. I thought that there had to be multiple man necessary, to open it. I tried to open it anyway. 

**Third Chapter**

The door made some strange noises. Metal with wasnt moved for some time had to leave its resting position and brake its bonds which connected over the time. Then I heard a crack and with a scream. The door exploded open. Surprised how easily this door opened I fell after it. The sun was so bright in this moment that I had to duck away, realizing, that I havent seen the sun for an eternity. The fresh air was rushing through my body and brain, making my mind as sharp as ever. The explosion must have ripped a part of the top of the tower away, revealing the sky, the real clouds, I was able to touch riding Merisax. A sharp but young voice cut me out of my thoughts. *who are you*? asked a small voice. I jumped back, raising my sword. A small figure, with the body of a girl, stepped out of the dark shadows into the room. Shocked that someone had survived and that someone was a little girl. Im Sherine, a dragon rider I heard myself saying, Who are you? The girl had now a piercing lock on her face. Locking at my sword, which was still glowing red. What are you doing here? The girl asked without answering my question in the slightest. So, I ignored her question too and went for a counter attack. How did you survive? I asked with a strong and daring voice. Remembering back, it must have sounded like she did something wrong by surviving. Because this time she answered a bit on the backfoot, her eyes still fixated on my sword: I believe, I didnt My jaw dropped. Hearing my voice still in a demanding Thone: And why would you think that? Holding back my protective instinct and getting her out of here, with all the bodies of the sorcerers. She stepped back into the shadows Lock around, everybody is dead! she cried out. I heard her crying, thinking back, I never cried, not even when my dragon died. I just had no one who would ever listen to me when I was little, my knowledge was, that if I want something, I either had to fight for it, or pay for it. Emotion was a weakness, that nobody should see. The only thing I was emotionally connected with, was my dragon. The way I loved her Tears ran down my cheeks thinking back. The afternoon light colored the room into a bright orange. The sun covered my face, the warm light was refreshing. The first time I stopped to appreciate the beauty of light. I lowered my sword from my defensive guard and let the sun shine in. Taking in as much as I could. Then I felt a warm body pressing against mine. I did not resist. I closed my eyes.

**Forth Chapter**

But her thoughts were not letting me go. Am I alive? Better are we alive? My pulse was present, I can bleed. I had hunger and thirst, but how did we survive. I survived a fall of hundreds of feet and she survived in a room full of dead. I heard tales from the north. People were getting resurrected. There is the house of the undying. The red Priestess from Pentos, the legend says that she cant get older nor die. But these are only tales, legends. But there is always some truth in a sailors story. 

Whats your name by the way? I asked. Still soaking in the warmth and the energy of the sun. I never was supposed to have a name. she replied cold as ice, I was raised up here, I was supposed to die up here. **I** was supposed to die, **not** the city!. I kept quiet. I didnt know what to answer to that. I tried to cheer her up by asking her that but

You said you were a dragon rider. I still gazed into the evening sun. ""Where is you dragon?""

I simply cannot understand what the heck is going on with Bran's plotline. Please, when explaining, don't further spoil it beyond season 6. Thank you!

Okay, so this is what I understood by far:

1. Bran has weird dreams with a three-eyed raven. In earlier seasons he tells Osha of this and she ignored it. These dreams are sometimes prophetic as Bran has experienced the death of Ned through a dream while Ned was beheaded in King's Landing, unbeknownst to Bran. Rickon has these powers too as he had the same dream.

2. Bran decides somehow to go North with Osha, Rickon and Hodor to find Jon in Castle Black after family crisis. Along the way, if I remember correctly, he is approached by Jojen and his sister Mira. Jojen tells him to find the three eyed raven and this tree or whatever. So Jojen and Mira go on to travelveith Bran. Eventually they find Jon in Craster's Keep, battling other gone-rogue Night's Watch members. While Osha and Rickon encourage Bran to go up to Jon and save all of them, Bran is encouraged to continue beyond the wall and find the goddamn three eyed raven by Jojen. Jojen is killed protecting Mira by the rogue Night's Watch. Bran ends up fscing the guy who chopped Jamie's hand off (can't remember his name, sorry). Jon is sad about this later. Bran and the group, without Jojen as he's dead, continue North of the Wall.

3. Osha tells Bran she won't go North of the wall, as it is too dangerous, and won't go back there. The group splits, with Osha taking Rickon away back to Jon and Bran, Mira and Hodor continue to the wall. Osha and Rickon are later taken hostage by Ramsay Bolton who ends up killing Osha, and yes, I know episode 9 will bring the Battle of the Bastards along with it.

4.  I'm not sure if he actually crosses the wall or what, but Bran somehow just pops into this cave with this old weird dude, a tree, and these Forest Kids who have powers. This is where it starts to get messy. By this point, I am missing something- how did he find and get into that cave? I know this Forest Girl lead him, but how did he know where to go? How did he know what is the three eyed raven? WHAT IS THE THREE EYED RAVEN?

5. Now it's the tricky part. Bran connects to this tree with the old guy, and they can see the past together. Simple enough, they can see the past. Apparently the old guy is the three eyed raven, okay. But Bran takes too many risks and delves into the realm of the past on his own. There he meets the Night King who touches him. By this touch, the Night King can now enter the cave, that was previously protected by a spell of sorts. Now it is dangerous, the Night King is coming!

6. Bran watched the creation of the Night King- the Forest Kids were threatened in their natural habitat by the men who originally came from Essos. The Children took a man, and pushed a wooden dagger into his heart, thus making him the Night King. They made him to protect them and aid with fighting against the Andals, but it backfired and now he threatens everyone. I think that was a stupid idea to begin with, but I can see where it came from. Also, Bran's powers were shared by the smartest of the Forest Children.

7. Now the Night King arrives with his zombie and skeleton army. Bran is again connected to the tree, busy with the past. This time he is at Winterfell, watching his aunt Lysanna. He sees Hodor, before he was Hodor, his name was Wylis and he was a Winterfell stable boy. Then suddenly, Wylis falls to the ground and seems to be experiencing some kind of an Epilepsy episode. He shakes and trembles. He starts shouting ""Hold The Door, Hold The Door!"" Until the words become unclear and turn into ""Hodor"". Meanwhile, in the present, Mira and the Forest Children are under attack by the skeletons. Mira needs to escape and tries waking Bran up from his trance state. He hears her in the dream and eventually snaps out. The old guy tells Bran that this is the end and to continue his legacy or work or whatever, and the vanishes ,as he is killed by the incoming skeletons. Bran snaps out of the dream and is taken by Hodor outside. Mira puts Bran on a sled and starts dragging him away in the snow. While doing that, she commands Hodor to hold the door to the cave, trapping the skeletons inside as he cries ""Hodor"" while holding the door. Mira then drags Bran away as Hodor is killed.

A few questions:

1. Did Hodor see his future and decide to call himself Hodor? Why didn't he stay Wylis as he was supposed to be? Why didn't he become Jodor only at his moments of death? I didn't get the whole Hodor name thing and would like an explanation on that.

2. Why is Bran so important? People are dying here for a poor kid with no legs and a very active mind. Why is he SO important? Yes, he will be king, but other people can be kings. He is not the only option out there. So why is everyone sacrificing everything for him?

3. What the heck is the deal with the three eyed raven? Who is he? What did he want from Bran? Why Bran? What does it mean to ""be the next three eyed raven""? Did this man just send signals to Bran to find him with dreams? Why him?

4. What do Bran powers truly do? Change the past? View the past? I don't really understand, since in the scene with Ned Stark's fight in the padt, Ned does seem to hear him in the past. So does Bran change the pasg or just has a look at it? Can Bran see the past of anyone, anytime? I need a really deep explanation about his powers.

Sorry for bombarding you guys with questions, but I need to get these things before moving on with the show! Thanks!",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;


Was just reading this and while there's a lot of interesting comparisons to Jesus, Bran also came to mind with his wolves, ravens, ""shapeshifting"", sacrifice for wisdom, holy trees, etc. What do you think?

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;He is the one-eyed All-Father, who sacrificed his eye in order to see everything that happens in the world.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Odin also has several animals. His two ravens Hugin and Munin (thought and memory) fly around the world and report back what they see.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Geri and Freki are Odins wolves

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Sitting on his throne, Hlidskjalf, with Frigg in the hall of Valhalla, Odin looked out across the whole world. But he wanted to know everything and gain wisdom and knowledge of things hidden from him. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He sacrificed his eye in Mimirs well and he threw himself on his spear Gungnir in a kind of symbolic, ritual suicide. He then hanged himself in **Yggdrasil, the tree of life**, for nine days and nine nights in order to gain knowledge of other worlds and be able to understand the runes.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Odin was also a shapeshifter, meaning that he could change shape. He could fall into an ecstatic trance and send out his soul, allowing him to adopt the form of another person or an animal. While his body lay in a trance, he could travel as a bird or a four-legged animal, a fish or a snake, through all the worlds and to far-off places.

Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss have parted ways with Lucasfilm due to scheduling conflicts caused by their reported $200m Netflix deal.

In a statement sent to Deadline just hours after a new The Mandalorian trailer dropped, the pair said: There are only so many hours in the day, and we felt we could not do justice to both Star Wars and our Netflix projects. So we are regretfully stepping away.

While Benioff and Weiss didnt reveal what they had planned in a galaxy far, far away, they reaffirmed their love for Star Wars, stating: When George Lucas built [Star Wars], he built us too. Getting to talk about Star Wars with him and the current Star Wars team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything.

Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has responded to the departure, hinting that Star Wars could still be in the Game of Thrones creators future: David Benioff and Dan Weiss are incredible storytellers, We hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on Star Wars.

Benioff and Weiss signed a nine-figure deal with Netflix in August, giving them the ability to create movies and TV shows exclusive to the streaming service. Both Amazon and, interestingly enough, Disney also bid for their services but were ultimately unsuccessful.

The future post-Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, though, is still bright, even with the new trilogy in limbo. Marvel mastermind Kevin Feige is overseeing an unknown movie in the franchise, while Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson also has a trilogy of his own in the works.

It Was like a huge movie, that could've needed some tweaks.

I think, Dany didn't snap in 5, that was just her, being naive, letting everyone pay with blood because her friends died, just how she always did it.

She snapped when all forces suddendly given to her got themselves placed in her head. A head that was forced to think simple and in little steps for years, to reach the big thing everyone gave his life and took lifes for.

On the other Hand, I still think Jon should've killed Frosty the angry snowman. They where a little bit to ""unexpected means good"" here, just like with the Cersei/Jaime-thing.

If you know anything about the topic and read this and answer then thank you for your time and effort &lt;3. First of all I know that one prequel is going to be about The Targaryens/Daenerys ancestors named The Dance of The Dragons (I think). And the other one is going to be about the North and the Stark ancestors. Now I also know that the lastly mentioned prequel will be released next year and has already been filmed. My first question is about like the form of the prequels. Will they be a movie, a series, a mini series? The other one is if there is any known cast for either of them? And the final is if there is a known year for when the Targaryen prequel will be released? I think not and I think they are filming it but some of you probably know this waaaaay better than me.

Anyways if you read through all of this and answer some of my questions then thank you I really appreciate it &lt;3!

Benioff and Weiss signed a nine-figure deal with Netflix in August, giving them the ability to create movies and TV shows exclusive to the streaming service. Both Amazon and, interestingly enough, Disney also bid for their services but were ultimately unsuccessful.

The future post-Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, though, is still bright, even with the new trilogy in limbo. Marvel mastermind Kevin Feige is overseeing an unknown movie in the franchise, while Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson also has a trilogy of his own in the works.

If GRRM will ever finish the booka, well, I wouldn't like Sandor's story to end, he should have some redemption arc like in the show, I liked his story with brotherhood, going beyond the wall and battle at Winterfell (I also liked that they kept Beric in show rather than bringing lady Stoneheart).If Cleganebowl would have to happen I would like it not to be pointless.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished season 4 and in my opinion, this was by far, aside from the red wedding the most painful string of episodes to watch starting from The Mountain and the Viper. IMO physically, Oberyn Martell's death was the worst. Just nasty, and shocking too. Ygritte's death, on the other hand, wasn't shocking at all-I kind of knew she would end up dead sometime in the battle but watching her die in John's arms was straight up the saddest thing this show or any show for that matter. I know some people who thought Shae's death was the worst but it really didn't faze me. After hearing her call Tywin ""my lion"" and realizing that she might've really just been a prostitute made it almost satisfying especially after her testimony.",8,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

You all know the problems because people complain about them every day on this sub and on r/freefolk. 

But, I think a lot of people have to decided to forget all of the seasons before 8 and hate on game of thrones all the time. I mean those first seven seven seasons were brilliant and exhilarating. And they were set up so well I honestly dont know if any ending would have satisfied this massive fan base.

I just wish instead of everyone complaining all the time about the ending we could reminisce on the brilliance that was most of game of thrones. Talk about all the amazing scenes and details we missed the first time watching. 

I just want to say yes, the end was disappointing. But, instead of judging the show on the last 8 hours, look back at the other 80 hours of some of the best moments in television history. Im just thankful I got to watch 7 years of amazing TV with a fan base as dedicated as yall. 

Theory crafting on this subreddit was tons of fun during the long breaks between seasons and even though most didnt come true it was so much fun to think about. I loved game of thrones and one bad season wont stop me from enjoying the rest. Thats my PSA, and my watch has ended.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for potential shows based in Westeros. Recently, one prequel series got the plug pulled, and now, there's yet another GoT series that's gotten the greenlight for HBO called House of the Dragon.

During the WarnerMedia investor event, which mainly covered the upcoming streaming service HBO Max, the upcoming 10-episode GoT series was announced. The story will be based on George R.R. Martin's book Fire &amp; Blood and take place 300 years prior to the events of Game of Thrones. The series will tell the story of House Targaryen.

""The Game of Thrones universe is so rich with stories,"" explained Casey Bloys, president of HBO programming. ""We look forward to exploring the origins of House Targaryen and the earlier days of Westeros along with Miguel, Ryan and George.""

Miguel Sapochnik (Game of Thrones, House) will direct the pilot and additional episodes for the series. Saopchnik will serve as showrunner alongside House of the Dragon writer Ryan Condal (Rampage).

No news as to when House of the Dragon will debut on HBO.

I liked the idea behind the prequel series called Bloodmoon, but what if that concept didnt have to be a series but instead a HBO original film? 

Game of Thrones: Bloodmoon (the official epilogue) could start off with the exiled Jon Snow discovering a most terrible secret in the real north during his years living with the free folk. 

While searching through the three eyed ravens cave remains, he discovers that the three eyed raven was not a savior, but rather had an insidious agenda... to get passed the wall and claim the throne. 

Bran, has been secretly fulfilling the three eyed ravens agenda all along.

Bran has used his warging abilities to manipulate others (why else would everyone have simply allowed Bran to become king without resistance?) to ascend into power, including possessing Dany and forcing her to become the person she never wanted to be... the queen of the ashes. 

The three eyed raven brought the white walkers back to life at the beginning of GoT, and purposely led Dany north to lose a beloved dragon so that it could be used to destroy the wall. 

The epilogue could go into Danys final resting place and the beginning of a new rebellion up north with Sansa and Jon joining together to defeat the three eyed raven while hoping to save Brans soul. 

The last Targaryen, Aegon Targaryen, with help from Sansa and Tyrion, will fight to save Westeros from the three eyed ravens tyranny.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

There are pretty darn crucial characters that would require some very good actors to pull them off. 

Characters like: 

Aegon the conqueror, the sea snake, Tyanna, mushroom, Daemon f\*cking Targayren and most importantly Jahaerys and Alysanne.

I could see this going a few ways; The most realistic first season would probably be closer to the beginning of their reign such as the conquest or right when Aegon is crowned. This allows them to fully flesh out the first king, his sisters, and potentially his children as well. They could do that or start from another point in history and run with that throughout the whole season. One possibility that somewhat piques my interest is an anthology series of sorts. With that we would have each episode focus on one specific part of the Targaryen rule. I like this because we're able to see more of the history within a season but also fleshing characters out is going to be far more challenging and most plots need more than 50 minutes to go through. Also if HBO decides to keep this series alive will the following seasons just be continuations or new whole segments in their history. After reading F&amp;B I really thought some of these stories would be insane to see live action and it finally looks like we're getting it.
