I'm not much of a reader anymore and they daunted me so I did the books on audio. 

Reading the books does not detract anything from the TV series but adds so much more. For the first three books it remains relatively true to the series. But you get to hear the internal monologues of many characters. Personally hearing the thoughts of Ned, Catelyn and Sansa was a real revelation to me. 

But most revealing of all comes in the fourth book when you get to hear the thoughts of Cersei.  

Personally I enjoyed the fourth and fifth books most because they took you to places not yet, and possibly never, to be seen in the tv series.

Remember the good ol' days when your favorite characters were still alive?  Go back and watch old episodes with the benefit of hindsight!  How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

##4.05 - ""First of His Name""

* Directed By: Michelle MacLaren
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 4, 2014

Tommen is crowned king. Meanwhile, Cersei meets with Margaery, Tywin, and Oberyn, hoping to sway them to her advantage in the coming trial against Tyrion. In the Vale, Petyr takes Sansa to the Eyrie, where she is to pose as his niece. Petyr is then pressured to marry Lysa Arryn that same day. While hospitable at first, Lysa quickly grows suspicious of Sansa, who she fears is attempting to seduce Petyr. In Meereen, after Jorah Mormont informs her about the fallback to slavery of Astapor and Yunkai, Daenerys decides to postpone her invasion of Westeros to bring order to Slaver's Bay and pronounces herself queen. On the Kingsroad, the Hound catches Arya practicing her water dancing, and he angers her by saying how that fighting style and her teacher Syrio Forel are worthless. On the road, Brienne finds out that Podrick has no practical skills as a squire. However, she is impressed with the fact that he killed a Kingsguard in order to protect Tyrion. Beyond the Wall, Jon's group attacks the mutineers in Craster's Keep. Locke attempts to kidnap Bran in the confusion, but is killed by Bran using Hodor's body. Bran and his company then continue their trek north while Jon kills all of the mutineers and burns down Craster's Keep.

##4.06 - ""The Laws of Gods and Men""

* Directed By: Alik Sakharov
* Written By: Bryan Cogman
* Originally Aired: May 11, 2014

In Essos, Stannis and Davos travel to Braavos to appeal to the Iron Bank to grant them a loan. Even though the Iron Bank refuses them at first, Davos manages to convince them to back Stannis' cause, while also resecuring Salladhor Saan and his pirates to Stannis' cause. In Meereen, Daenerys attempts to take on her new role as Queen as she listens to the requests of her subjects, including Hizdahr zo Loraq and a man whose goats were killed by Daenerys's increasingly uncontrollable dragons. At the Dreadfort, Yara leads an attack in an effort to rescue Theon but fails when Theon refuses to come with her. After seeing Theon's current state as Reek, Yara tells her men that Theon is dead. Ramsay rewards Reek for being obedient and, in order to take Moat Cailin, tasks him to pretend to be someone he's not: Theon Greyjoy. In King's Landing, Tywin puts a price on the Hound's head and instructs Varys to continue spying on Daenerys. Later that day, Tyrion is brought to trial for Joffrey's murder. However, all of the witnesses brought in testify against him, including Meryn Trant, Pycelle, Cersei, Varys and, to Tyrion's shock, Shae, who gives a false testimony. Angry and humiliated, Tyrion demands a trial by combat.

The tour I went on would follow these signs if found, and explore any filming locations they come across. The guide told stories of going so far as to use binoculars to get a peek at the recording sites. I spoke to her, and she told me these things (SPOILERS):

* Kit Harrington is a regular. Like, Jon-Snow-absolutely-must-be-alive regular.
* She showed [the leaked swimming photos of Arya Stark](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/17/22/2B711EA300000578-3201487-image-a-112_1439848745400.jpg) and took us to their location. The guide said that she was there when they were recording, and they had shielded off the entire bay.
* The crew was spotted at the same location where [Renly's camp](https://theselfishyears.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/game-of-thrones-day-3-002.jpg) was filmed. She used binoculars and saw Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) leading an ~~Greyjoy~~ Ironborn army. Apparently, Theon might be a badass in Season 6.
* The Greyjoys seem to have a bigger role in Season 6 overall, with Yara Greyjoy also taking on a more central role.
* They have also been recording at Castle Black a lot, but I suppose that doesn't really say much.

And that is all I got out of her at the time. What do you think?

*Edit: Meant Ironborn army, not Greyjoy army.*",79,266,False,self,,,,,

In S4, when Brienne and Pod first set out on their journey, Brienne tells Pod she doesn't need his help and tells him he is released from his oath as her squire. However, Pod refuses leave her side. 

In S5 episode 2, when Brienne finds Sansa at the Inn and Sansa says she doesn't need her help, Pod later asks Brienne ""Maybe if both Stark girls refused your service, that releases you from your oath."" Brienne rejects this idea and continues to look after Sansa.

The biggest theory on Jon at the moment is R+L=J and that he is going to rise from the dead and do his thing. While I also think that this is the most likely scenario part of me hopes that the following happens just to mess with the fans:

Opening scene of S6 is the Tower of Joy. We get confirmation of R+L=J in a heartwrenching scene at Lyanna's deathbed. Fade's out through a wierwood or raven to Bran warging in his training under the Tree (we effectively just saw this scene through Bran looking into the past). This opening would give every GoT fanboy (including me) a raging hardon for the rest of the episode waiting for Jon's resurrection. 

Final Scene opens on Melisandre  at castle black. She asks where the body is. She goes to the body and kneels down beside Jon. Everyone is ready to bust their load all over their tinfoil hats. She looks up: ""Build me a fire."" She then proceeds to burn Jon's body (along with our hopes and dreams) in the hopes of aquiring a last bit of voodoo magic to put to some use. Maybe it even saves Stannis? who knows?

I just thought this would be a great way to say to the fans ""Yes you were right, R+L=J, Jon was a Targaryen. Also, Fuck you it doesn't matter. In case you forgot anyone can die.""",16,25,False,self,,,,,

But so far, there was only one major character death (Ned Stark), two if john snow actually died. honestly, I dont agree with the notion that any character can be easily killed off in this. except for those two, everyone killed in that show is a minor character, and I don't see why people make such a big deal about it. and yes, I do think rob and lyanna stark are minor characters.  
  

edit: to me, having a pivotal role in the plot isnt enough for me to consider them a major character. They need good characterization and character development, which many characters do not have, and makes it hard for me to consider them as major characters. imo, only ned, arya, daenerys, and john snow are major characters.

During season one Cersei talks to Catelyn Stark about her first child and how she used to go and sing to him, however the manner in which she did this seems secretive, why? This is because this child, to everyone in the realm, including Robert was dead. Cersei staged her child's death as a way to appease Jamie who may have been angry about her having a child with Robert (this bit is a bit hazy so anyone has a better idea please do say). There is the obvious fact that the women had ""yellow hair"" which Cersei does and that Gendry's mother sang to him which Cersei said she did. This theory gains weight (tinfoily weight) because of Gendrys possible return at Cersei's trial, what if, in Cersei's crazed state she announces that Gendry is her legitimate son, this could lead to the faith militant backing Gendry (now Baratheon) to the throne. And the tinfoil grows in weight, what if this is the ""bitter-sweet ending"" we hear so much about, what if when John Snow inevitably gets resurrected he decides to rule the north and leave Gendry to be lord of the seven kingdoms, this is bittersweet as everyones favourite dead man Jon Snow dosent get his throne, but at least we have a rightful and good king.",20,7,False,self,,,,,

Let's assume everything goes like Cersei wants to - nobody knows officially about her incest children and Joffrey is still alive and he is a king.
Jaime is in a kingsguard so he can't be the lord of Casterly Rock and Tyrion can't be the Lord of Casterly Rock because Tywin doesnt want to.

And now I can be wrong so feel free to correct me. Wouldn't it mean that Tommen becomes the Lord of Casterly Rock? Is it what Tywin would really want to? A man called Baratheon being the lord, not Lannister? Of course there is Lannister blood in him but still...

Remember the good ol' days when your favorite characters were still alive?  Go back and watch old episodes with the benefit of hindsight!  How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

When both Jaime and Bronn refuse to fight for his cause (Jaime because he cannot fight anymore, and Bronn because he will not risk it, despite his friendship with Tyrion) Oberyn Martell steps up, seeking a chance to avenge his sister by killing Clegane. Daenerys has sex with Daario, before sending him off on a mission to deal with the resurgent slavers at Yunkai. Melisandre and Selyse prepare for their departure of Dragonstone, and Jon Snow faces off against Alliser Thorne over the incoming wildling threat. Arya and the Hound come across some people from her past: Rorge and Biter. The Hound is wounded but refuses to cauterize his injury. Brienne and Podrick meet another of Arya's former companions, Hot Pie, and learn of her survival and her time with the Brotherhood. They then resolve to travel to the Vale, reasoning she would go there in search of living relatives. In the Vale, Aunt Lysa is enraged when she witnesses Petyr Baelish kissing Sansa, for which she later threatens to push Sansa through the Moon Door. However, Baelish intervenes in time and instead pushes Lysa to her death.

* Originally Aired: June 1, 2014

The wildlings arrive in Mole's Town and massacre the entire village. Gilly is discovered by Ygritte, who spares her once she notices the infant she is holding. Sam laments his decision to leave Gilly there, as he believes her dead. Ramsay forces Reek to masquerade as his former self, Theon Greyjoy, and orders him to get the Ironborn to surrender Moat Cailin. The Ironborn surrender in hopes of returning home but are flayed and slaughtered by Ramsay and his army. As a reward for securing the Moat, Roose legitimizes Ramsay as they arrive at Winterfell. Across the Narrow Sea, Missandei and Grey Worm deal with the sexual tension between the two of them. Ser Barristan receives a letter intended for Ser Jorah, which pardons Jorah as a reward for spying on Daenerys. After Barristan confronts Jorah, he gives the letter to Daenerys, who orders Jorah to leave Meereen and never return. In the Vale, Sansa reveals to a council investigating Lysa's death her true identity and convinces the council of Littlefinger's innocence. Outside the gate of the Vale, the Hound and Arya arrive and are informed of Lysa's death. Meanwhile in King's Landing, Jaime and Tyrion have a philosophical conversation as the trial by combat approaches. During the trial, Prince Oberyn gains the upper hand, but allows his hubris to get the better of him while trying to force Gregor Clegane to confess to his sister's rape and murder. The severely wounded Mountain catches him off-guard, kills Oberyn by crushing his skull, and confesses. Tywin sentences Tyrion to death for regicide.

On [this](https://wiki.dothraki.org/Season_3_High_Valyrian_Dialogue), the dothraki wiki page highlighting episode-specific uses of Valyrian, the phrase is written:

&gt;Dovaogdys! eksia ossnts, menti ossnts, qilni pilos lue vale tolvie ossnts, yn rie dre drikts. Urnet luo buzdaro tolvio belma pryjts!

I am presuming the macron indicates long vowel usage (or syllabic stress). However, when [spoken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjkVgYZB0aA&amp;t=3m5s) by Emilia Clarke on the episode, it sounds like she says: 

&gt;""Dovaogdys! eksia **ossnts**, menti **ossnts**, qilni pilos lue vale tolvie **ossnts**..."" 

She actually doesn't seem to speak the whole line as it is written on the Dothraki page. Does anyone have any information as to whether this was a mistake in filming, or are there rules of Valyrian pronunciation to which I am ignorant? Or, perhaps, is the Dothraki wiki page simply incorrect?

Also, her trilled ""r"" when speaking the word ""pryjatas"" in the same sequence: is it simply a dramatic pronunciation, or are certain ""r""s meant to be trilled in Valyrian?

Enjoy and let me know what you think!  
  
 
  
**The Death of Eddard Stark** 
  
A tired brow bears hungry gaze  
Atop the seaside stage  
Sweat drips slow from matted hair  
Like the ending of an age  
  

Impossible, these changing tides  
Once braved by lordly Ned  
Duty called for King's own Hand  
And now lies all but dead  

A soldier for his banners black  
An heir for father slain  
A Wolf to wrestle Dragons mad  
A voice to grant Stag claim  

A husband to his lady wife  
A father to his sons  
A servant to the Stag grown old  
Turned traitor, used and done  

Screams for justice shake the stage  
And nip his quickened heart  
Surrounded by great actors  
Unequipped to play a part  

To confess a sin is to commit  
In truth if first was false  
But peace rests so precariously  
Atop the liars waltz  

So out it poured, like boiling broth  
Burned from throat to soul  
The hungry Wolf, from greed so foul  
Had eaten Stag a'whole  

The hatred for him grew around  
Insults hurled with trash  
Shame mounted him and stripped his pride  
Stomped legacy to ash  

Now Lord Stark would be condemned  
To petty life and task  
With beard and cloak he'd freeze  
With thieves and dawn ol'duty's mask  

His fate was certain once he sung  
His song so false and black  
For he had made his final plea  
And could take no words back  

But by wicked intervention  
In move so dark and low  
Stag's false son grew smile wide  
And loudly answered ""*NO*""  

Confusion gripped both Ned and crowd  
First feeling they all shared  
For what would follow from that word  
Not one soul had prepared  

Headsman marched to carry out  
The sentence king decreed  
Son shouted *I shall have his head,  
And let the whole realm see!*  

The reality of final fate  
Struck him hard and cruel  
His role had been reduced from  
Builder brave to broken tool  
  
His mind drifted to home and Snow  
So far from rocky sea   
A voice cut through the salty haze  
""Oh Ned, you promised me""  

A hush froze players one and all  
As deadly Ice did swing  
Silence promised in his place  
That *""Winter is Coming""*

In the process, she ends up in a snow covered Iron Throne room. Is there anything in the books that this is in allusion to or related to?

It just seems like the Oldtown shooting for this year is minimal and maybe it's simply Sam visiting through and maybe talking to one or two maesters down south before venturing up to see his rents.  



Does anyone think this could be the case?  Or maybe instead of taking a boat, could Sam and Gilly stop through Horn Hill on the way to Oldtown?  I'm just trying to feel out what people think about their journey and the potential inclusion/exclusion of a really cool character.

The ""Red God,"" the Smith, R'hulor, et al., against the ""Other,"" Stranger, Faceless God, et al.

The Fire God has as a champion, obviously, Daenerys Targaryen. 

The Ice God has Bran Stark.

Think about it:  (Excepting Hodor) He is the only character who has always been heading north, pulled by some force beyond the Wall, like Sauron calling Frodo home.  

George R. R. Martin almost named the seventh book ""A Time for Wolves,"" and Sansa, Arya and Bran are all getting cozy with different facets of the same god:  Life is short, make your own justice.  All men must die.

What if GRRM is attempting to tell the Anakin-to-Vader story that George Lucas  mangled? 

Bran is about to be able to look through time at all the injustices his family has suffered:  The executions of his father, his grandfather and his uncle.  He'll see the Red Wedding, Sansa's rape, etc.  What if his mind explodes and all that psychic power bursts out as he swears to make sure Winter Is Coming forever.

He could control White Walkers en masse like so many Hodors...

In the recent history of Westeros, the plans for intermarriage between Great Houses are extensive.

The mother had an antler of a stag through its throat, and the stag had been killed as well. The children of the Direwolf were left without a mother, alone in the world. At first only 5 wolves were found, but a sixth was found by Jon Snow, which was a runt.

So, what many believe is that the wolves represent the Stark's. When the parent died by an antler through the neck, many interpreted that as Ned being beheaded because of his involvement with Robert. Which would make sense because Robert died just as the stag did.

My theory, is that maybe the wolves represent the Stark's all the way through the wolves' lives. Looking at the wolves' lives can tell us something about what we could have seen coming or what is yet to come. I think in Jon's case it supports the L+R=J theory.



Robb's Wolf: Was a symbol of fear to many. Many thought Robb could become the wolf, which was false (I was wrong :) ). The wolf died in a cage at Freys' castle.

Robb: Feared by many, but was not as terrifying as many thought. He was close to losing the war before he died. Robb died trapped in Freys' castle.


Sansa's Wolf: Killed by Ned because Arya's wolf had attacked Joffrey, and then ran away. Punished for what a family member had done.

Sansa: Abused by the Lannister's/Bolton's because of what her family had done.


Bran's Wolf: Is loyal to its group when heading north. Needs saving at Kraster's Keep. Finds Jon's wolf at Kraster's and wants to save it.

Bran: Loyal to his group, even revealing his identity to the men at Kraster's Keep to save his group. Needed help escaping Kraster's Keep. When he sees Jon fighting the Wildlings, he helps him.


Rickon: Lol who knows


Jon's Wolf: The runt. Almost left behind by the Stark's, but a good man saves him (Jon Snow). May get separated from who he is loyal to, but he  always stays loyal.

(Theorizing Part)
Jon: The bastard. Almost left alone in the world when his mother (Lyanna) died, but a good man (Ned Stark) saves him and takes him in. Jon may go to the wall and leave the Stark family, but he is forever a Stark and is forever loyal to them.

This is because I'm not that good at English. Apologies.

Okay, so today I'm here to propose a new GoT fan theory. I believe that the asoiaf books, and the GoT series, has enough proof to make me believe that the Valonqar Cersei has been warned about, is not one person, BUT MANY PERSONS.
 
This theory may seem to be a bit far-fetched, but, I have seen enough evidence to believe that many actions by a bunch of 'valonqar' have led to events which will eventually lead to Cersei being tried, and ultimately, killed. I wouldn't call this theory a normal theory, I would call it a theory behind theories, because, if this theory is correct, then three theories can be said to be, to some level, legitimate.

* The Oberyn poisoned Tywin theory

* Jaime kills Cersei theory
 
and finally...

* Gregor and Sandor fight in Cersei's trial by combat. **(GET HYPE)**

In order to understand this theory, let's look at how Cersei got herself in trouble first.

Cersei re-installed the faith militant in KL in order to use it as a front to cull the Tyrell family and their influence. However, her plan backfired when she was arrested by the FM on charges of incest and treason. Now, in WOW, there will be a trial by combat, which (very possibly) will lead to Cersei's death.

If we look at it, here are major reasons why Cersei got into trouble in the first place.


* Cersei being in power, which is due to Tywin dying, and also, her apparent control over Tommen.
* Her incestous relationship with **Jaime**(V), and her relationship with Lancel.

Now, let's look at the events that led to Tywin coming to KL.


* **Petyr Baelish**(V)^ kills off Jon Arryn, leading to Ned Starks arrival in the capital as Hand.

* Due to **Ned Stark's**(V) snooping around, and finding out about Cersei's incestuous relationship with Jaime, led to her ordering Lancel Lannister to give Robert too much vine on the hunt, leading to his death.

* King Robert's death leads, to Cersei, using **Joffrey**(V)^, indirectly seizes the throne.
-Joffrey appoints Tywin as hand.

(Note: I am aware that Tywin sent Tyrion to KL to initially rule in his name, due to the Stark attacks, but eventually, he arrived at KL to take up his duty.)

So, we've got one wheel in place with Tywin in KL. Tywin's death is the major reason behind Cersei being completely in power as queen (mother).

Now, let's look at the second series of events.

* Joffrey is murdered

* Cersei immediately, believing **Tyrion**(V) is guilty, and also to kill him off, convicts him of Joffreys murder and leads a trial against him. 

* **Oberyn's**(V) actions before he could've killed the mountain leads to his death and the death sentence being passed on Tyrion

* Tyrion is found guilty by Trial by combat, and sentenced to death. 

* Tyrion is freed by Jaime, he kills Shae and Tywin.

Now, with Tywin dead, Cersei completely asserts her power and goes on a mad killing rampage to take out Tyrion (killing every dwarf similar to Tyrion in the land) and also, ignoring her fathers teachings to put family over everything else, reinstates the faith militant to take out Loras and Margaery, putting the Lannister-Tyrell alliance in Jeopardy. However this backfires on her when she is ultimately arrested and demands a trial by combat.

So, I'd like to conclude, that the Valonqar are **Jaime**, **Tyrion**, **Oberyn**, **Joffrey,** **Ned**, and finally, **Petyr**. Also, I'd like to point out, that since Tywin death is a crux of this theory, it is fairly possible that Tywin may be the hand referred to in the prophecy, a play on the fact that he is the Hand of The King. I must also point out towards Ned's role in this as well, since Ned Stark was not only hand, but also a person who played a role in the events that led to Tywin's appointment as hand, and Cersei's eventual death.

Speculations.

* The chances of Cleganebowl taking place get higher. (GET HYPE)
* She loses the TBC, and ultimately gets killed by Jaime Lannister. I speculate that he will do so to spare her from the shameful way she will get executed. Jaime may kill himself after this action. Whether he chokes her or not is something I leave to you to speculate. (this is assumed from the way the High Sparrow humiliates the people he finds guilty)
* Petyr may most probably kill off Tommen before this to further his ambitions.


NOTES.

* *Petyr can be considered a Valonqar, he has no other mentioned kin in ASOIAF, and also, because of his nickname, Littlefinger, coined Catelyn Tully due to his small height as a child growing up in the Vale.*
* *Joffrey can be considered a Valonqar, since he has had an older brother, (with brown hair) who was stillborn.*",9,4,False,self,,,,,

By all appearances, Tyrion was just sort of ""tagging along"" and had no significant role to play here--the main purposes of the trip were to A) persuade Eddard Stark to become Hand of the King; and B) to arrange a marriage pact between Prince Joffrey and Sansa. Though the Starks do take steps to accommodate him, (making sure that his room has extra lighting so he can read at night, for instance) it doesn't seem like much, if anything, is expected of him otherwise. Even at the big dinner, he doesn't bother to make any major appearance, spending most of the night outside chatting with Jon Snow.

Tyrion's decision to accompany Jon Snow to the Wall seems to have been motivated by his curiosity and sense of adventure more than anything else. But once Tyrion arrives at Castle Black, he finds that Lord Commander Mormont is eager to have his ear, believing that he may have some sway with Robert &amp; Cersei back in the capital. Tyrion doubts his own level of influence, but it seems likely that he would have at least tried to bring these matters to the Crown's attention, if not for...well, everything else that actually happened.

Cersei is unpleasantly surprised when Tyrion arrives in King's Landing with the news that Tywin has appointed him acting Hand of the King. Almost immediately, Tyrion decides to test the true loyalties of the Small Council members, which exposes Pycelle as Cersei's informant. Conversely, he actually befriends Varys, and develops a decent working relationship with Littlefinger; it doesn't
seem like he had much of a relationship with any of them prior to his appointment.

And what I have to wonder is, 'Why?' If Tyrion did live in King's Landing prior to the beginning of the series, wouldn't he at least be acquainted with people like Varys, Littlefinger, Pycelle, Janos Slynt, even Stannis and Renly, as they were both Small Council members. At the very least, I would have to think that he ran in the same social circles as a lot of them.

Could it be that Tyrion spent most of his time at Casterly Rock, rather than King's Landing? That could help explain his seeming lack of familiarity with the Small Council members, but I'm not sure all that adds up, either. After all, Tywin (then-Lord of Casterly Rock) and Tyrion basically hated each other, so neither would likely object to putting more distance between them, whereas Jaime (for all intents and purposes, Tyrion's best friend) presumably spent most of his time in King's Landing, given his status as a member of the Kingsguard.",20,94,False,self,,,,,

Also, this is my first post on this sub ha ha.

After a whole night thinking about some of these possible theories I really can't help myself but to share them with as many people as possible. So here it goes and hopefully some of you guys can confirm or fact check some of this stuff for me.

* **The people of Yi Ti possibly worship the White Walkers/Others**

  Everyone has probably heard about the religion known as ""The Lion of the Night""(which will be referenced as TLoTN) right? I mean it's one of the more popular beliefs  in the world of Ice and Fire right up there with R'hllor and the Faith of The Seven. But what interests me so much about this religion is that it's main deity is the punisher of man and the harbinger of darkness rather than a hero of light and righteousness as the other, more Western beliefs paint they're deities as. The origins of  TLoTN trace back to the creation of Yi Ti it's self,  because according to some Eastern scribes TLoTN and some woman known as the ""Maiden-Made-of-Light""(MMoL) fathered a god king literally named ""The God on Earth"" (TGoE) who ruled for 10,000 years before ascending to the stars and becoming a god himself. ""What does this have to do with the theory?"" you might be asking yourself. well here's where shit gets spooky...

After TGoE died, his crown went to his offspring all of which had ruled for shorter and more turbulent times after the last emperor for some unknown reason. The line went something like TGoE -&gt; ""The Pearl Emperor"" -&gt; ""The Jade Emperor"" -&gt; ""The Tourmaline Emperor"" -&gt; ""The Onyx Emperor"" -&gt; ""The Topaz Emperor"" -&gt; ""The Opal Emperor""

  After the death of the Opal Emperor, for the first time ever (to my knowledge anyway) a woman ascended to the throne. This woman was known as the Amethyst Empress. Looking at his sister in envy, her brother assassinated her and took the crown for himself proclaiming ""The Bloodstone Emperor"". His rule was marked by ruthlessness and utter turmoil, committing atrocities and assorted madness such as turning his back on the gods of Yi Ti,  taking a tiger-woman as his wife, worshiping a black stone that had fallen from the sky, practicing cannibalism, enslaving his own people and performing necromancy [\(source\)](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Blood_Betrayal). 

Well this pissed of TLoTN and it is said that he sent the Long Night on the races of Men as punishment for their wickedness, supposedly anyway. And as we all know, Azor Ahai liberated Yi Ti from being overrun by the demons of TLoTN but instead of worshiping Azor Ahai...... the citizens of Yi Ti worship the very god who punished them in the first place. Which is strange as hell to say the least. 

Now.. I don't have an explanation on *why* they worship the Other's, but in the world of Ice and Fire such a thing is not unheard of. There are tales of Wildlings further up North in the lands of always winter who worship gods of ""Ice and Snow"" and making sacrifices to them much like Craster did in his keep. All in all I think this theory is one of my better thought out ones.

* **The world of Ice and Fire operates on sort of a Ying Yang parallel**

   If you believe in the theory that there is some sort of landbridge connecting the far north of Westeros and the far East of Essos than you might also consider this: If the Others originate from these lands then that would mean that this part of the world is a center of cold and darkness in this world, which would oppose and also compliment the center of heat and flames of the world.. Valyria. Dragons were first tamed in Valyria, while on the opposite side of the world the Others came from that yet unnamed continent.

Also when you think about it.. the world has shifted (and still is shifting) back and forth from periods of Ice, cold, and brutal winters that last for years at a time to periods of Fire, warmth, and long fruitful summers. with periods of chaos and strife woven between the two. For example, After the First Men and the Children of The Forest made their peace there was a period of calm. But for whatever reason the first period of winter began some decades after this event and was a major event for both Westerosi and Eastern Essosi cultures (that is part of the reason why they both have similar stories regarding the Long Night).

And after the encroachment of the Others subsided, Westeros went through an imbalance in the natural order of things, this resulted in the driving of the Andal zealots and their crusaders across the narrow sea to slaughter all who opposed them to implement they're own order. After this period of imbalance it then became the era of Fire with the Valyrians learning how to tame Dragons and erecting a vast empire. Then, for whatever reason scientific or spiritual the Doom happened and whipped out the Valyrian civilization which threw the world into turmoil yet again, this era even came to be known as the ""Bleeding Years"" and saw the emergence of the harselords we know as the Dothraki people who did not cease to kill and pillage many free cities and kingdoms in central Essos.

And now... the world is still in turmoil and it is shifting back twords an era of Ice once more.

* **Azor Ahai was a Valyrian and also killed TLoTN**

   Okay, so this one has far less credibility and reason behind it but I'll include it anyway. Playing off my theory about the Ice and Fire paradigm, it would only make sense if the one who supposedly saved all of mankind was from Valyria (again, a place of fire) and came to quell the threat from those of snow. Azor Ahai uses a ""sword of flames which could mean a dragon of some sort(deep tinfoil territory there) Also his legend that is widely regarded as canon claims that:

&gt; To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword.[3] He laboured for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.[3] The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

I'm sure Azor Ahai wouldn't just pick any run of the mill lion just to see if his magical sword would work, half of this world runs on some sort of mysterious magic for god's sake!.. I mean according to the tales from Yi Ti TLoTN came back *during* the Long Night so somehow, He must have caught the ""god"" himself and, hoping to capture some of his mystical power to use against his army drove the sword through his chest. And I mean (assuming that the Others of Yi Ti are similar or the same as the White Walkers of Westeros) it would make perfect sense for the sword shattering on using one on one of them, I know that they're weapons do the same thing so it's pretty safe to assume it would happen is Azor Ahai would use a regular sword on an Other.

I really hope I stumbled on to something, thank you all for your time in advance.

Edit: grammar and location confusion. 

Edit 2: Oh! and I almost forgot one more *really* important theory.

* **The White Walkers/Others have a Westerosi-like political system of feudal kings**

   This is perhaps the most crucial theory yet, it has already been theorized that the White Walkers have some sort of cultural system instead of just being a horde of frozen, undead zombies. While I'm not really sure if these ""Night's King's"" Have anyone over them like a ruler on the Iron Throne in the Seven Kingdoms would, I do think that depending on where the Others are you will have different ""lords"" looking after his land. I come to this conclusion because of the Long Night it's self. For example, TLoTN and his wife the MMoL (Maiden-Made-of-Light) supposedly birthed a son together that would come to found a kingdom called the Empire of The Dawn and the crown passed down through his son's bloodline (until it got to the Amethyst Empress of course) which would indicate a basic line of succession... something that a mindless demon army wouldn't have.

The Night's King marching on the wall is perhaps but a minor kingdom of many more Other/White Walker lands and Empire. Maybe the Night's King is invading Westeros to forge an Empire like Aegon did hundreds of years ago... who knows... Maybe then Men of the World of Ice and Fire are the demons encroaching on their territory instead o the other way around.",6,30,False,self,,,,,

In the show, he's still alive, despite Stannis' blood magic.

The way I see it, this has implications in two areas:

* The Greyjoy storyline. Obviously this is already one of the bigger departures from the books at this point, but its possible that it's just been slowed down so that it can be fully developed over the course of a single season. So either Balon is about to die, or they're combining him with one or more of his brothers and condensing this storyline a lot. Any thoughts? (Also, any solid casting info from season six regarding the greyjoys? I remember hearing some rumours, but I haven't been following too closely.)

* The Stannis/Melisandre storyline. This seems to cast a lot of doubt on the power of kingsblood/Melisandre's power in general. Nobody's mentioned it yet, but it could come up, especially if Davos and Melisandre end up at odds.

##4.09 - ""The Watchers on the Wall""

* Directed By: Neil Marshall
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 8, 2014

The Night's Watch prepare for the coming invasion by the wildlings. Gilly arrives at the Wall shortly before Mance Rayder's army. The wildlings attack from both sides, with one army climbing the Wall, and Ygritte's army attacking Castle Black. After Ygritte and her army get through, a bloody battle ensues. The wildlings attempt to break through the tunnel leading into Castle Black with the help of several giants and a woolly mammoth, but are stopped by Grenn and five others, who die holding the tunnel. Alliser Thorne goes down to the main level of Castle Black to fight, leaving Janos Slynt in charge. However Slynt proves to be incompetent as a commander, and is tricked into going down the main level, effectively leaving Jon in charge. Pyp is shot by Ygritte and dies in Sam's arms. After watching Jon kill Styr the Thenn, Ygritte prepares to kill Jon, but is shot by Olly, who finally gets revenge on Ygritte for killing his family. Jon holds Ygritte in his arms as she dies. With the help of Jon's direwolf, Ghost, the Night's Watch secure the ground level of Castle Black. The wall climbers are sliced apart and completely obliterated from a massive scythe that acts as the Wall's secret weapon. The wildlings retreat, but, Jon predicts, not for long. Seeing no other choice, he goes beyond the Wall to find and kill Mance.

---

##4.10 - ""The Children""

* Directed By: Alex Graves
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 15, 2014

Jon Snow treats with Mance Rayder, but their negotiations are interrupted when Stannis Baratheon and his army suddenly overrun the wildling camp and take Mance prisoner. Later, the Night's Watch burn the bodies of their dead while Jon burns Ygritte beyond the wall. Bran and his party come upon the large Heart Tree from his visions, but as they arrive they are attacked by wights; though Jojen is killed, Bran, Hodor and Meera are saved by a child of the forest who takes them to the three-eyed raven. In Meereen, Daenerys responds to a former slave's wish of being sold into slavery again by allowing him to contract his labor to his former master on a yearly basis. The next citizen brings her the charred remains of his daughter who was burned by one of her dragons. As a precaution, Daenerys chains her other dragons in the catacombs. In the Vale, Brienne and Podrick come upon Arya and the Hound. Brienne mortally wounds the Hound, while Arya escapes. Meanwhile in King's Landing, Cersei orders Qyburn to do anything to save the Mountain, who is dying of wounds from Oberyn's poisoned spear. She confronts her father, threatening to reveal her and Jaime's incestuous affairs if she is forced to marry Loras (after which, she rekindles that same affair). Tyrion is released from his cell by Jaime, but he later finds Shae in Tywin's bed and kills her. He then confronts his father in the privy and shoots him with Joffrey's crossbow, before escaping the city with Varys. The season ends with Arya buying passage on a ship bound for Braavos with the coin Jaqen H'ghar gave her.

The rain is dry - Reminds me of when Khaleesi and the dothraki are all dying on their long journey  
And the snow falls up - Doesn't the snow fall upward when Dany is in the House of the Undying? Or am i making it up?

The water burns - Wildfire in the river during the battle

I have been avoiding a lot of posts until I was close to finishing this last book so my apologies if this has already been discussed to death.  The books delve into this much more than the show so alot of this is based on the books but anyway...

  I know the warg thing has varied strength/power from person to person.  Some aren't really aware they are experiencing it and think its dreams but others can go as far as taking over another body.  Sometimes the warg seems to just be kind of along for the ride - seeing and feeling what the animal is experiencing but not really controlling it's actions. Some scenes when Bran is in Summer's head he seems like this and Arya with her dreams and the owl when she was blind.  Other times he has taken over and controlled Summer and has also done this with Hodor. Orell seemed to be able to control the eagle. Sixskins had taken over both people and animals. 

This all makes me wonder if some of the more powerfull wargs can control dragons. And if the earlier Targaryens either had the ability themselves or used wargs to control their dragons. 

And why haven't powerful wargs taken over the minds of kings to end wars, etc.?   I also wonder if maybe it has happened before and that maybe it led to some of the insanity we see in the mad king.  If Varys had access to someone with this power just imagine what he could accomplish.

So what do you think?  Could Bran take over a dragon to defeat the Others if the story went that way?  Could he (or another person with these abilities) take over Dany or Cersei?  I don't think they would be able to control the Others/wights because it seems the subject has to be alive in order for it to work.",41,113,False,self,,,,,

Death is the only way a sworn brother can escape his vows. Red lady brings Jon back. Stannis is alive. Brienne needs him to save Sansa. Stannis needs an army. Naturalizes Jon. Jon Stark is now rightful heir to Winterfell. Gets the wildlings to fight for him and by proxy Stannis

I think Jon Snow died when he was stabbed by the Nights Watch. There is no getting around it hes dead. But this is crucial for advancing the rest of Jons story. A sworn brother of the Nights Watch is sworn to serve until he dies. Now that Jon is dead his oath has been fulfilled he owes no obligation to them, and if he comes back from the dead he couldn't realistically serve there without being killed again. The red witch is at the wall, and we know that the red god has the power to bring people back from the dead so its not unlikely that she will revive Jon. She showed a lot of interest in Jon before leaving with Stannis. She knows something we don't about Jon and she wont let him stay dead for long. Once Jon is back he wont be able to stay at the wall he will need a place to run. This is where Stannis comes in. In the show we never see if Brienne killed him. I think that she knows she needs him to be able to save Sansa. Even though she swore an oath to kill Stannis she swore another to save the Stark girls. I think she will use Stannis to complete her quest to save Sansa telling herself she will kill Stannis when the job is done. If Stannis is still alive Melisandre will take Jon to him. Stannis told Jon at the wall he needs him as warden and that he would make Jon Snow, Jon Stark. Jon turned him down because he had an oath to the Nights Watch. Now that he no longer owes a debt to the Watch he is free to join Stannis and help him try and retake Winterfell. Stannis's army was decimated by the Boltons and there is little chance he will be able to raise an army agian. But that's where Jon comes into play. Jon just saved a very large army from North of the wall. Hes beginning to look like Mance Raider 2.0. The Wildlings would never fight for just Stannis, but for Jon they might.

I'd like to share with you the story behind my hand-crafted Iron Throne replica, which you can see here:

http://imgur.com/a/bNxEI

Now, what drove me to this. Well, it all begun few months ago when I was planning a 30th birthday present for my best bro'. He is a gigantic GOT fan and I settled on buying the Iron Throne's replica off the internet. However back then it was sold out on Amazon (I mean this one: http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Iron-Throne-Replica/dp/B009RHO7TC) and it looked rather poorly, especially for the price set there.

So I decided to do one on my own. Well, the thought actually came to me on a party, where I was eating some stuff out of... sword tooth picks:

http://slodkiehobby.pl/images/kontrans/0-1000/Wykalaczki_plastikowe_pickery_10_%5B39%5D_568.jpg

I ordered, in total 2 packs of 2 different kinds of swords (2x 150x 7 cm and 2x 250x 8.8 cm) which was barely enough for this around 20 cm high statue. Later same week I bought some hot glue and the long, however very enjoyable evenings begun. With paint, I went with black sprayed gum as the background layer, which gave the throne quite a unique feel and light reflection and afterwards used 3 Citadel colours:

Abbadon Black
Dryad Bark
Leadbelcher

to get this unique dark setting. I really like the Dryad Bark, which gives it a feel of little bit of rust here and there without making it the dominant colour. Now the really fun part were the places for hands, where one would literally push the swords in at some point and they would look awesome!

Obviously I was mostly inspired by the TV version of the throne, but was not quite happy mimicking it too closely. After all, let's face it - it looks like a plain chair with few swords attached. That's why my version is simply wider to begin with - makes it look heavier and more epic. Allows me to use way more swords too. I did also use swords for the actual sitting area, however melted them closer together with more glue, so it now looks like properly melted iron. Figured no one would like anything spiky below his shiny meaty bottom.

Now, the real reason I'm writing this up is the fact, that I really enjoyed doing this statue. And I mean like something more then anything I ever used to. So I figured I give this some spotlight, maybe there is some poor soul out there who would also like a hand crafted iron throne of my design and works. Obviously each (future) statue will be unique, but I will follow the design as shown on the pictures above. If you are interest, please write to me at deebart@gmail.com or try to contact me via this reddit message. If not, I hope you liked my creation anyway and perhaps I might inspire some more folks to follow my steps and do their own Iron Thrones?

Thanks for reading!

Bart

P.S. For those of you asking, throne is exactly 21.5 cm tall (8,385 inches), 22.5 cm width (8,775 inches) and 19 cm depth (7,41 inches). Though it's made of hot plastic glue and plastic swords, it's quite solid and doesn't feel it will break accidentally. In fact I'm pretty sure it fell off my desk once during construction and didn't loose a single sword!

P.S.2 (18/11/15 00:02 CET) Thank you all for support and interest! It's midnight here in Poland now, so I'll be going to sleep now. I'll reply to all messages in the morning!

P.S.3 Provided I'll be doing more thrones, I plan to setup twitch creative channel and stream my progress! Stay tuned for details:)",51,404,False,self,,,,,

Some speculation thrown in as to how it might play out.

Thinking about the Free folk.. it seemed a condition was that if they come south with Jon, that they must not be made to bend the knee.  Before that, Mance said he would have lost his following if he had bent the knee (and died for it).  It has been a point that has been made pretty consistently.  

It's also been pointed out quite a few times that the Starks / Northerners have more in common with the Wildlings than is generally advertised.  


Going way back, when the Targaryens conquered The North, it is said about Torrhen Stark (King of the North):

http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Torrhen_Stark
&gt; King Torrhen Stark swore fealty to the Targaryen Dynasty in order to spare the destruction of Winterfell...and his people. He was forever after known as ""The King Who Knelt"".


This shows that The North had these sentiments about being free, and that kneeling marked the end of their 'freedom'.  That was until Robb Stark. 

http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/King_in_the_North
&gt; During the opening stages of the War of the Five Kings, Lord Robb Stark was proclaimed as the new King in the North by his bannermen, the first in 300 years



For speculation on how it could play out:

Daenerys will have the Iron Throne and have it nearly united, except for The North.  She saved the realm with her dragons and fought back the white walkers!  Now is time to press her Targaryen claim.  She has fought to free slaves for so long, what happens when she encounters a kingdom that wants to be free?  

Jon will be King of the North. He is reborn (after maybe warging into a wolf) as a man with the heart of a wolf (more free/wild). He will refuse to bend the knee.

Jon is supported by bannermen and Free folk in a bottom-up power base.  Daenerys represents a top-down power base ""Be my free subject or else"" Both believe in freedom, with very different interpretations. 

eta:

| ""From this time until the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.""  Robb Stark

Apologizes ahead of time for any trip ups with my post. (The format of the title is wrong isn't it?) 

Okay to the actual heart of the matter. I've read and watched the series pretty religiously and I'm always surprised with all the parallels in Westeros to real life/non-Westeros things. For a class in college we were taking a look at Michelangelo's *David* and after some discussion on the artistic elements of the sculpture and a brief retelling of the biblical tale of David and Goliath, I couldn't help but think of all the situational parallels between David's fight and Oberyn's. (Had less to do with the statue and more to do with a mental revisitation of biblical tales, of which I do not dwell on very often.) 

A brief list of obvious similarities: 
Both men rejected armor, and both were the clear physical underdog in their respective fights

I'm sure you all can find more similarities but I'm very scatter brained so the list will remain short for the time being!
(My next statement is going to be based on a probably fairly incorrect assumption but bear with me) Much of Game of Thrones' influences are drawn from history - primarily from English/western European history. So if the fight scene between the Viper and the Mountain was a biblical allusion, audience members would be familiar with it and might recognize it as such. However, unlike the biblical tale, (SPOILER: also plz don't ban me) Oberyn is not successful and dies. I guess the question I'm trying to ask is what do you all think this juxtaposition of our expectation and  offers audience members? Is it merely for shock value? Is it further evidence that Westeros is a cruel world devoid of the intervention of a benevolent god? Or something totally different?

I don't think this theory has been posted before, but if it has, I'm sorry.

In A Clash of Kings, Varys gives Tyrion this riddle:
&gt;In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. Do it, says the king, for I am your lawful ruler. Do it, says the priest, for I command you in the names of the gods. Do it, says the rich man, and all this gold shall be yours. So tell mewho lives and who dies?

I think this may be a bit of a prediction for how events are unfolding.   

The first part of the riddle has the king. We've seen the power of kings in Game of Thrones come and go. Robert, Joffrey, Renly, Stannis, Robb, Mance Rayder, and even Khal Drogo are dead. The current king is Tommen and he doesn't seem to know what he's doing. 

The second part of the riddle pertains to the priest. Right now, in the show, the High Sparrow and the Faith have a lot of power. They imprison Loras and Margaery Tyrell, and even Cersei, who believed herself to be untouchable. 

The third part of the riddle pertains to the rich man. Does this mean that someone with a lot of money is going to become more powerful? Littlefinger perhaps? Or the Iron Bank of Braavos? 

The final part of the riddle has to do with the sellsword. The riddle is saying that power resides wherever people decide it resides. Will the endgame of the show all come down to an ordinary person? Not a king or a priest or a rich man, but someone as normal as a sellsword?

Let me know what you think!

They are very similar in character - both like whores, wine, tits. Both have hate for Cersei and kinda like Jamie. Tywin might knew that his wife had a romance with Bobby, but he couldn't do anything - like when Cersei and Jaime had sex - giving it to public would do only worse things, and having his wife's child a future king? Tywin would certainly not like it, that's why he never told anyone about it, and absolutely despised Tyrion.

Yes even worse than the Boltons. 

**Issues**
-Stannis is a religious fanatic. He murders people for not praying to his god. This is best shown by his burning he brother-in-law Axell Florent to death. Stannis stated the reason he burned him was because he refused to tear down his idols (the seven). Maybe if he shouted ""Allah Akbar"" before people each burning would realize how terrifying this is and stop trying to justify it.

-No Melissandre's prophecies don't justify his murders. Many people on this sub claim that Stannis has to make these sacrifices the white walkers will destroy Westeros. The problem without that is Melissandre is a known charlatan. She admits a large part of her magic is trickery. Also her prophecies are clearly wrong seeing as Stannis died instead of winning the Battle of Winterfell. So like all other religions, its followers aren't omniscient and killing in the name of your god is still murder.

-Many of his ""sacrifices"" don't actually serve any purpose besides murdering infidels. Stannis didn't kill Ser Axell Florent for his kingsblood, but simply because he didn't worship the right god.

-Stannis is a kin-slayer. He has murdered or attempted to murder his brother (Renly), his daughter (Shireen), his nephew (Gendy), and his brother in law (Axell). (If Theon murdering the Stark boys is viewed as kinslaying then murdering your brother in law probably counts). 

-Stannis is a lying hypocrite. He didn't need to kill his brother Renly to save Westeros. Melissandre even says the war of five kings means nothing, only the war in the north mattered. Stannis could have simply let Renly become king on the condition he helped Stannis fight against the White Walkers. Even though Stannis is technically supposed to be king, there is precedent of an older brother allowing his younger brother to succeed the throne (Maester Aemon proves this as a man who actually knew what honor meant). Stannis didn't need the iron throne, he just wanted it because he is a power hungry hypocrite.

-He is an oath breaker. Stannis gave Renly the night to consider his offer and then had him assassinated before the night was up.",37,0,False,self,,,,,

But as a word of warning to GRRM he must tread very carefully with these last two books and how he chooses to end his story of Ice and Fire. I see this ending coming down to one of three ways, so bear with me as I try to explain this. The first, the best, and the least likely ending in my opinion we can hope for is ""A realistic happy ending"", which basically means the Night's Watch(and allies) will somehow defend against the White Walkers, which I am assuming will heavily involve Brandon Stark(I think it would be insane if they did a scene with Bran controlling Drogon and Daenerys Riding/controlling her other dragons to fight off together the White Walkers which would be the coolest yet most unlikely fight scene.) and the The Realm(Meaning all of Westeros and Essos) will be thrust into a long, prosperous, and peaceful era led by none other than Daenerys Targaryen. The second and most likely ending i feel GRRM would use is ""A realistic neutral ending"", which to put it simply is people die, the White Walkers are repelled with a good amount of effort, and the wheel of power keeps spinning and spinning on to the next person and the next, a vague but somewhat understandable ending. The third and the worst ending I can imagine happening would be ""A realistic Chaotic ending"" , which will involve the White Walkers making it past The Wall and destroying everything in their path until Westeros can band together to fight their true enemy. Many lives would be lost in this ending with Lords and Peasants both dropping like flies until they realize their one and powerful foe.

But even if GRRM had decided to use one of the mentioned endings above or neither there is one thing that is *ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL* to his ending, that I beg/plead him not to make the mistake of, I have seen other authors make this mistake, the dreaded and lazy ***Deus Ex Machina***. I do know that he has written and read many novels, but since he considers this his Magnum Opus I fear the anxiety and pressure of people's expectations will cause him to rush/make mistakes and produce an ending not worthy of this Grand Series. My example of this is the Book Series *Eragon* which if you have read most people will agree how great the beginning and middle are but the ending is too vague and leaves a bitter aftertaste in your mouth.

Anyways, feel free to make a statement, speculate, ask, or criticize my Theory! I am very open and would be glad to hear what you guys have to say!  ",19,0,False,self,,,,,

The show, Game of Thrones, is named after the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, and the books contents are covered by the entire first season of the show. George R R Martin said that fire symbolizes love, passion, rage, and things like that; whereas ice symbolizes deciet and stuff. I feel like the books will focus on Westros as wholeall of the passion, the lies, everythingwhile the show will focus on the Game of Thrones. I mean, the title has to be an accurate reflection of the shows contents, and the contents of the first book is almost entirely centric on the Game of Thrones, and while that theme continues out into the rest of the series it also goes to other issues in-depth like the Wall, Bran's story, Theon's personal battle, and it also incorporates tons of other characters that were removed from the show (Lady Stoneheart, that Martell guy in Mereen). 

It seems to me the show will mainly concentrate on the Iron Throne, while the book will focus on the tons of other issues in the world. They do only get ten hours per season, so it's understandable how they would need to condense the show's plot more.

##5.01 - ""The Wars to Come""

* Directed By: Michael Slovis
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 12, 2015

In a flashback, a witch tells a young Cersei that someone younger and more beautiful than herself will one day steal her accomplishments. After Tywin's burial, Cersei chastises Jaime for freeing Tyrion. Lancel Lannister returns, now a devoutly religious man and a member of the ""Sparrows"". In Pentos, a despondent Tyrion agrees to accompany Varys to Meereen to support Daenerys's claim on the Iron Throne. In Meereen, the insurgent ""Sons of the Harpy"" murder an Unsullied, and Hizdahr zo Loraq and Daario Nahaaris try to convince Daenerys to reopen the traditional fighting pits to appease the former Mereenese elites. Daenerys' locked-away dragons breathe fire at her when she comes to check on them. In the Vale, Littlefinger puts Robin in the care of House Royce and leaves with Sansa, their caravan passing Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne. At the Wall, Stannis seeks to enlist the Wildlings in his war against Roose Bolton. Jon Snow is unable to convince Mance Rayder to accept Stannis's authority. Stannis then has Mance burned alive for treason, though Jon shoots him with an arrow to kill him quickly.

##5.02 - ""The Lion and the Rose""

* Directed By: Michael Slovis
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 19, 2015

Arya arrives in Braavos and is accepted into the House of Black and White, also called the temple of the Many-faced God. Cersei sends Jaime to Dorne to bring back Myrcella; Jaime recruits Bronn to assist him. Podrick Payne recognises Littlefinger and Sansa in a tavern; Brienne of Tarth tries to offer Sansa her protection because of her vow of allegiance to Catelyn Stark but is rebuffed. Stannis offers Jon Snow legitimacy and lordship of Winterfell if he leaves the Night's Watch to help him, but Jon declines; Samwell nominates Jon as a candidate for Lord Commander, and he is elected by the casting vote of Maester Aemon. Daenerys faces a riot after she decides to execute a former slave who murdered a captured member of the Sons of the Harpy before he could be tried. Drogon reappears when Daenerys is atop her citadel overlooking the city of Meereen.

This is a long post, I hope you'll bear with me. So...

During Roberts Rebellion, Jaime Lannister, the last remaining Kingsguard in Kings Landing, slew King Aerys Targaryen and a pyromancer Hand of the King. He did so, to the eyes of many, to dispose of the King and allow his father, who was actively sacking the city, to do with the crown as he pleased. Jaime, however, acted so as to save the people of Kings Landing from the lighting of wildfire caches that promised to consume the entire city. After he does so, he takes a seat upon the Iron Throne and awaits the resolution of Roberts Rebellion.

Simultaneously, Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain that Rides, and Ser Amory Lorch, a largely incompetent knight of the Lannisters, are, on the secret order of Tywin Lannister, climbing the Red Keep to kill Elia Martell and her two Targaryen children. Their brutal killing brings the Mountain even greater infamy, while giving the new King Robert Baratheon plausible deniability regarding his guilt in the slaughter of innocents for the purpose of consolidating his power. To a lesser extent, Tywin Lannister and his House are offered the same plausible deniability. Regardless, the Martells and their bannermen largely isolate themselves from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, deeply wounded by the death of their princess and her children for the benefit of new crown, but unable to do anything but dream of revenge and hope for the fall of the new Protectors of the Realm.

However, what would have happened if Jaime Lannister had acted differently? What if, instead of waiting upon the throne, he had resumed his duties as a Kingsguard, and gone to protect Elia Martell and her children? Theres plenty of reason to suggest he might; during his career as Kingsguard, Jaime constantly grappled with his oaths to protect the King. Specifically, his internal struggle to contain himself while the Mad King executed Rickard and Brandon Stark, along with his protests to the Kings rape and abuse of his wife Rhaella, demonstrate that his desire to protect the honorable, virtuous, and innocent constantly conflicted with his oath to protect the King. That day, in slaying Aerys II, he had finally justified that conflict to himself; but theres no reason to believe he has entirely disregarded the value of his oath entirely, He had struggled with it for years, and attempted to use it argue just action during Aerys abuse of Rhaella. This kind of struggle is not likely to be broken and completely abandoned in one instant; despite his slaying of the King, it would make sense that he would feel obligated to act as the Kingsguard he always wished to be. Had he acted to reconcile his oath, and gone to protect those he was sworn to, would have fought the Mountain and Lorch. Given his skill as likely the third greatest swordsmen in the realm at that time, behind only Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Barristan Selmy, both of whom he trained under, he certainly has the potential to triumph in this confrontation; for sake of argument, lets assume he does. Having killed his foes, he would then await the arrival of Tywin Lannister, aware of his fathers intent to see the royals he guarded killed.

Tywin would certainly attempt to continue with the murder (at this point, he cannot deny his involvement, and it becomes an extra judiciary execution). However, Jaime's killing of the Mountain, one of the Lannister's most important knights, along with Ser Amory Lorch, might cause Tywin pause. Even if Tywin is unfazed, it seems likely that Jaime would at least offer resistance: stand in the way, demand negotiation. He had protected these innocents by fighting what is likely the single most difficult and emotionally charged fights of his entire life - against the most vicious, largest, and strongest knight in all of Westeros, along with a (admittedly unskilled) companion. What's more, these men were people he had just before believed to be allies, under the commands of his father. Tywin would come upon him in a moment where Jaime was questioning his allegiance to the House and family, while simultaneously reevaluating his father's entire character, and imagining himself as willing to risk his life to fight his will in this matter. The only thing he would not doubt, in that moment, is his dedication to protecting the lives of innocents against monsters, both the people of King's Landing from Aery's madness and pyromancy, and that Martell-Targaryen princess and her children from the brutality of the Mountain.

It has been suggested that Jaimes attempted murder of Bran Stark in A Game of Thrones, along with many other actions, is a sign that Jaime would willingly see the deaths of innocents to protect his family, and thus would be inclined to obey Tywin. In refutation to this point, Jaimes killing of Bran occurs under entirely different circumstances. First, this action is taken in the defense of Cersei, his only love, and himself, much more than it was the defense of his family. Furthermore, it was something that emerged significantly from the callous and cruel character that seems to have largely evolved from the alienation and disrespect he received from the court as Kingslayer (more on that later). Finally, Jaime, in the defense of Elia and her children, is in a state of moral passion, as explained in the previous paragraph, that is not remotely present in his decision to kill Bran.

His resistance, even if it can only be maintained briefly (which I don't think is the case; his resolve would be adamant), should well enough give enough time for Robert's party to arrive. If they're present, they become much more complicit in the crime, and, especially with Ned's (and Jon Arryn's?) influence on the negotiations, noticeably less likely to commit to the execution of these children. At the very least, I believe Jaime could be talked down from his impassioned defense by assurances that those he was protecting will be unharmed. I think its important to note that its only when this third party delegation arrives, and particularly when Ned Stark/ Jon Arryn offers their points of view, that Jaime would be willing to acquiesce. His reevaluation of his father would necessarily include distrust, especially regarding the safety of Elia and her children.

There are now three possibilities for the royal children, and emergent changes in the political climate of ASOIAF. By the most optimistic, but least likely, evaluation, they would be sent home with Elia, to be recognized as Martell children, but stripped of any right to inherit the throne. This might require that the new regime declare that the Targaryen reign was now entirely illegitimate, and that no Targaryen had any right to throne any longer, under any circumstances. While this might cause some additional upheaval among loyalists, and change Robert Baratheons reason to claim the throne as a Targaryen descendent, I do not think this impacts the story dramatically. However, this would dramatically change the functioning of the court, as the Dornish would likely be present as somewhat embittered, but active and in some ways grateful, participants. Alternatively, the children could be taken as hostages, and, similarly to my previous example, be barred from ever taking the crown. Im unclear on the ramifications this would have on the events of the story. Finally, and perhaps most likely, Robert would renege on his false promises to Jaime, as he and Tywin likely intended to, and have had the children executed. This would be a grave insult to the Martells (and, on a side note, to Jaime); however, I do not think they would isolate themselves from court as they did in the current universe, so long as Elia herself was unharmed.

This brings me to the next point; even if the children must be done away with, neither Tywin nor Robert are likely to desire, let alone order, Elia's execution. She is no longer a threat to the crown in any way, and even Tywins ruthlessness doesnt seem likely to demand her death. However, if Elia is sent home but her children killed, it invites an even terser situation of Dornish political involvement than if their family were maintained as a whole (excluding Rhaegar). However, it seems likely that the Martells would recognize the crowns prerogative in the matter, and remain acquiescent. Likely they would distance themselves from court in a similar, if lesser, way that they have done in the current universe, especially if her childrens death brings Elia to suicide (a distinct possibility). However, if she, with or without her children, is kept a hostage in Kings Landing, Dorne would come to Kings Landing in an entirely different capacity; this would likely see the greatest Dornish involvement in the politics of Kings Landing of any possibility, and the relationship the Martells would have with Jaime would conflict fascinatingly to their relations with the King hes sworn to protect and the great Lord he was born to (especially if the children were executed).

However, lets explore the possible (but unlikely) execution of Elia. It seems quite possible that her needless death might pull the Martells into open rebellion (as the free kingdom of Dorne once again), as the new King would explicitly recognized as the executor (not executioner) behind the decision. A continuation of war would be devastating to the fledgling regime; loyalist houses might redouble their efforts and follow the Martells, and the ever important Houses of the Reach would be unlikely to offer full support of the Baratheon regime. Even Houses that had been firmly allied to Robert might withdraw support; Eddard Stark and Jon Arryn (and the Riverlands with them) might be so repulsed by their child-murdering King to renege on their previous support. If this instability continues long enough, we could easily see Dorne leaving the fold, and theres a smaller possibility of the North, Riverlands, and the Vale leaving as well. If the Iron Throne were to lose control of these four kingdoms, its not unimaginable, even though it seems more and more far-fetched, that the Reach might withdraw. Certainly, even if Dorne is the only one to leave, or is very painstakingly reclaimed (which, given the Targaryen inability to conquer, seems unlikely), the regime would likely have so little support that the Greyjoy Rebellion might have been successful, and at least one Kingdom would leave the fold, and likely two. This conjecture, however, is getting out of hand.

Were Elia executed, but the Kingdom maintained, Dornish hostility to the new regime, including Stark and Baratheons alike with the Lannisters, would be so great so as to demand significant deliberation and alienate the Dornish even further from the court than they are in the current series. This could significantly change their treatment of Viserys and Daenerys; instead of just arranging marriages for ""if everything turns out,"" the Dornish houses might offer significant indirect or even direct support, creating a much different situation for our exiled Targaryens. Finally, it isn't hard to imagine that the open execution of Elia and her children might invite discrete assassination attempts. Accidents in hunting, jousting, and riding are evidently easy enough to arrange in this universe, and it seems to be difficult to discern who's truly responsible for poisonings. While they may not be so bold to target the king himself, members of his family, or at least those of his closely allied Houses and other political allies, could easily become targets. More than anything, this opens the possibility for a couple new names and characters described as murdered in the interim of Robert's Rebellion and the beginning of AGoT, and/ or the addition of new deaths/ changes in manner of some deaths in the current narrative.

Regardless of the happenstances and choices emerging therefrom, whether Tywin manages to have them executed before the other rebel leaders arrive, whether the children are executed or not, whether Elia is killed, sent home, or held a hostage, this dramatically changes Jaime's story. The story of Jaime slaying the Mountain and Amory and resisting the will of his father and the new King, all in protection of the innocent Princess and her royal children, his reputation as Oathbreaker and Kingslayer is brought into a new light. His relationship to everyone around him, especially Ned, his father, the King, and the Dornish/ Martells, becomes so much more complex. His character, too, would likely be shifted away from the nonchalance, cynicism, and cold cruelty we see in the show. As evidenced from his confession to Brienne, so much of that came from his disillusionment with the ""honorable"" people of the world, who despised him for the noblest act he ever committed, without a second thought to who he had been thus far in his life - an honorable and enormously talented knight, and one of the most desirable (if unattainable) men in the Seven Kingdoms. His slaying of the King is still an enormous issue, but it comes alongside a heroic narrative that people simply could not ignore. Perhaps we'd see a Jaime much closer to the one we see at the end of AFFC, or, more likely, a new characterization of Jaime altogether. He's one of my favorite characters, and I love thinking about how he was constructed and how it could be different.

I know this is all far enough removed from the story to be almost pointless to think about. Honestly, if Jaime had been there to protect her, I think he would have slain the Mountain and Amory, stood his ground against his father long enough for Robert and Ned and Jon Arryn (if anyone could tell me when he arrives at King's Landing, that would be great). From there, it's a question of what they would decide. Whatever the case, the Dornish relationship to the throne, and Jaime's entire story and character, would be changed dramatically. But the fact is that the death of Aerys and the deaths of Elia and the children seem to be nearly simultaneous, and its quite possible that the Mountain did his work before Aerys had even been killed. A slight change, simply in Jaimes action, could see Jaime killing Lorch and the Mountain in midst of the murders (particularly the rape of Elia would provide a window for him to arrive), and while there are still ramifications to that, they're not nearly as spectacular as my original idea(s). My ideas require both this change and either the confirmation or change of the timeline, such that there is time for Jaime to reach Elias chambers before Gregor and Amory. The fact remains that this isnt how the story happened, but I really enjoyed exploring this idea.

I'd appreciate any and all thoughts, where and why I'm wrong included!",7,9,False,self,,,,,

I kind of just thought this up today and it's probably 100% wrong but ayy why not see what people think, right?
Ok so as we all know Gendry was last seen rowing away on his boat. Clearly, he's been out there for a while if he hasn't reached land yet. Is it absurd to think that he just MIGHT come across the ship with Jaime and a dying Myrcella (via Sand Snakes poison)? I could see their plotlines becoming intertwined and Gendry could maybe help Jaime in a similar way to how Podrick helped Tyrion. Maybe Gendry could even have the antidote for Myrcella's poison.

How do years/dates work in Westeros? Seasons are clearly not of uniform length so I'm guessing their planet's orbit around their sun is irregular or maybe the tilt of the axis changes? They mention ""moons"" passing, meaning months presumably, but I don't recall specific names of months ever being mentioned, and I can't even be sure that their lunar cycle is just like ours. I'm guessing they keep it vague because month names in our world are associated so much with seasons that it would be confusing if they talked about it being January, but it's still summer, for example (depending on your hemisphere). So do they have different names for the months than we do? People celebrate/are aware of their name days (i.e. birthday, right?), so I assume they do have a way of recording days of the month.

However they do have a concept of years but they aren't quite like Earth's (four seasons in one year) but is it definitely the same length, i.e. 30ish days per month, 12 months/moons? I guess it would make it confusing for readers/viewers if it wasn't so, as it would affect how we perceive characters' ages, how much time passes between historical events, and so on. I also don't remember if they ever talk about a ""new year"" (whether as a celebration or just the point where the record rolls into the next number) although multiple years seem to pass during the show.

Anyway I guess the question is how do years/months work in a record-keeping way, and also in a physical (astrological?) way if there is an actual answer to that.",14,11,False,self,,,,,

I originally wrote this as a response in another thread, but I'm interested to see what others' opinions would be, so I wanted to open this up to the subreddit:

Could we argue, then (and this is a little separate from this post's point), that's this entire series is in some way GRRM's critique on religion throughout the ages? 

We can easily compare the Lord of Light to Jesus Christ, who has also been referred to in some respects as a Lord of Light. The whole anticipation of Resurrection to destroy the darkness is there and many people have ""seen"" ""real"" things that can be argued ""truth"" or miraculous, things they say came from God (Lord/Jesus etc), which is similar to the Red Priests and followers of R'hollr. They can seemingly heal, and do real things, but there is also some level of trickery and magic, which calls into question the validity of R'hollr.

We could compare the Seven to ancient Greek Mythology, in some respect, as there is a specific god or deity there that you should pray to depending on why you're praying ie. praying for the Mother's Mercy, or praying to the Warrior for a good outcome in war. Now of course, there are far more Greek/Roman gods/goddess's than 7, but the comparison is there. And again, there are some things that have happened in the show/books, and in our world that give some validity to this way of religion. Although, in our world, ultimately, mythological gods have been completely debunked.

I'm a little less sure what we could compare the Three Eyed Raven too, or rather, the old gods that are represented by the Weirwood trees (perhaps Buddhism and I only say that because they believe in a sort of, connected or shared consciousness that could be similar to the collective conscious of the Weirwood trees - but maybe that's a stretch?). But again, we see SOME truth to it (Bran and in season 4), and yet... we're left wondering, what is true and what is not. 

MUCH like the real world. We have religious fanatics, atheists, agnostics...so many religions to choose from...and we're often left wondering what is true and what is false (personally, as an atheist, I think religion is holding humanity back, but I'll leave the subject of truth alone). I think we can agree that in the world of Ice and Fire, there is magic that perpetuates various religions, and it is magic that causes actually things to happen. Is GRRM trying to tell us that magic is the singular ""force"" (oh my god Star Wars...) that is truth, and that perhaps ALL of the religions in Westeros/Essos etc, are false? Does he believe this of OUR world? I would be curious to find out. 

I feel as though exploring this notion could possibly even lead fans to some answers... if magic is the only truth, where does that leave us? What kind of answers can that give us?

I would love to get a great discussion going on over this :)",19,3,False,self,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;

I want to watch a series that has the themes:

&amp;nbsp;

1) Focus on Survival of the Fittest. Not on Friendship.

2) Power is [almost] everything. Not so much Love.

3) If you want to help other people, you better help yourself first. Think of a greater purpose.

4) Strong personal development. We could see the character's personal thoughts and how they grow as he gains experience.

5) No meaningless fight. Hopefully we can see meaning in the fights/struggles and apply them to our real life.

**RECASTS**


* [Gregor Clegane](http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/05/19/19-the-mountain-2.w529.h352.jpg) has been recast three times. Each actor has had very similar features (tall, black hair and beard)


* [Rickard Karstark](https://criptabajoeltorreon.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/john-karstark.jpg) has also been recast, but this time much older. Apart from his white hair and age, you can see that his costume is identical and his beard is still bushy and long.


* [Beric Dondarrion](http://i.imgur.com/HNRIiFn.jpg) was recast very similarly too, retaining the same look. [Myrcella](http://www.radiotimes.com/uploads/images/original/83685.jpg) and [Tommen](http://static.blogocio.net/imagenes/articulos_257782.png) as well, both similar in looks to the previous actors and seemingly recast for age and acting ability. Dean Charles Chapman had previously been on the show as a young [Lannister cousin](http://i.imgur.com/TJ3nWgK.jpg?1) who had been killed by Rickard Karstark, and the producers were impressed with his acting.


**?? RECASTS ??**


So what's up with **Daario**?


The two actors look [nothing alike](http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DaarioComparison.jpg), either to each other nor the way Daario is described in the books. 


They have different hair color, hair length, one has a beard and the other does not... It seems ONLY the costume is the same. **No effort was made to make the actors look similar** and provide an easier transition for the audience, as was seen with other recasts.


Also, this was not an easily forgotten minor character with just a few lines. I would argue that Daario was a memorable and recognizable character even to a casual viewer. 


Viewers found the recasting odd at the time. Ed Skrein was soon cast in [The Transporter](http://www.themarysue.com/ed-skrein-post-got-role/), and finally this year vaguely stated that the recasting had to do with ""[politics](http://zap2it.com/2015/09/game-of-thrones-recast-ed-skrein-daario-politics/)"" and he would have stayed on GOT forever if he could have his way.


So perhaps this was **not a recast**.


**The actor for Daario was not replaced. The *character* of Daario was replaced with another character**


This is not a new theory. There's a fairly well known belief that Daario is secretly Euron Greyjoy (watch [this](https://youtu.be/Crn_eg-1ekU) Alt Shift X video for a complete explanation). 


This would not be the first time in ASOIAF that characters have been glamored to look like other characters (not wearing a different face like The Faceless Men, but rather illusioned, magicked.) In the books, [Mance](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mance_Rayder) is glamored to look like the Lord of Bones, and therefore escapes burning at the stake while the LoB burns instead. This glamoring was accomplished by wearing a red gem bracelet from Melisandre, similar to the one around her [neck](https://cdn.worthy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Melisandre%E2%80%99s-Ruby-Necklace_new1.jpg). 


I would also hypothesize that this also isn't the first time that we have seen the show leave out certain magical elements in order for them to have greater impact later on, and not be foreshadowed. Lady Stoneheart's resurrection was omitted, possibly so that Jon's resurrection could be more unexpected to non book readers. Perhaps glamoring has been left out until now, so the revelation of Daario as Euron would have greater impact. Obviously, the show has also left out the character of Euron altogether so far.



**MY REASONING**



* Previous recasts have left us not questioning the radical recasting of Daario. 
* Viewers feel as though they are a viewer *inside* the world, and not outside of it. We think we see what the characters see. While characters may look at Daario and not see a change, we as viewers are not glamored.
* The change in actors occurs at the beginning of the 4th season. In Season 4 Episode 5. Daario, under his own command and not Dany's, leads the Second Sons to capture the Meereenese Navy, consisting of 93 ships (which is suspiciously the same # of ships as Euron's fleet,) suggesting this may have been when the switch occurs. It would allow Daario/Euron to command the fleet without suspicion.


**TLDR;**


*As I said, much of this theory is not new. My contribution is simply that **the recasting of the Daario actor was intentional**, and is actually a new character under glamor (Euron). We can see the difference while other characters cannot.*",11,10,False,self,,,,,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJKLjq9471I

0:26- A Thenn, Laboda ( a fierce and highly skilled warrior http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Loboda ), isn't much of a match for the cool and casual moves the WW puts on display.  

0:50 - Jon digging around for the glass.  Why doesn't the WW just put his ice pick through Jon here?  WW walks up behind Jon, grabs his shoulder and throws him across the room.  

1:05 - WW gives Jon another toss.

1:22 - WW uses blunt force to knock Jon to the ground (could have stuck the ice pick in here too).  

1:30 WW looks on as Jon reels from the blow.  

1:32 - WW jumps off platform with a certain grace.  Again, why didn't he simply jump off the ledge and do an assassin style drop attack while Jon was flailing about?

1:58 - Finally, something that resembles an attempt to kill Jon. The swing that is blocked by Longclaw.  

None of this happened in the books, so the question I have is.. why did they write this to look like the WW was wearing Jon down, rather than taking one of the easy kills?  It starts out with the WW showing he can take out a greatly skilled warrior with ease, and then using Jon to demonstrate the rag-doll physics of Planetos.    Was it just for tension and suspense in a fight scene, or more?",23,8,False,self,,,,,

Cersei is absolutely nowhere to be seen, even if you courted her favor. Margaery does nothing, even if you courted her favor. The items you had the chance to steal far earlier in the game amounted to nothing, which seems to imply they were writing Mira's chapters at the last second with no overall plan.

Mira was the most interesting character, she could make or break bonds, manipulate or befriend so many different people that it seemed like the final chapter was building up to one grand trial with character witnesses speaking for or against her. Which made sense, she was the handmaiden for the Queen to be and potentially in the service of Cersei, the Queen Mother. Furthermore she was the daughter of a noble house. How in the hell would they not give her the trial she's due? Immediate execution is for commoners. And if you do die, in the credits Margaery just shrugs her shoulders and goes ""Well, I guess she did it, what else wasn't she telling me?"" instead of raising hell over it.

In the end she was thrown into a cell, no trial, no chance to defend herself. Nothing she did across a year and six chapters amounted to anything, or had an effect on anything. She was either forced into marriage or got her head lopped off. With her head about to be lopped off, you can't even choose to have her accuse the merchant scum who framed her to the crowd. Which makes no sense at all, she had no reason to keep quiet about it like Ned did, he actively intended on hurting her family. She should have been screaming to high heaven about his misdeeds.

They either ran out of funding, ran out of time, or just ran out of talented writers because Mira's final chapter was terrible. I have a vague suspicion that Cersei's actress wasn't available and they had to rewrite Mira's final chapter entirely, that's the only thing that makes any tiny amount of sense.

What I wanted was a self-contained game with a satisfying ending that took all of my choices into consideration, shaping the ending for my characters how I've guided them this whole way. What I got was an unsatisfying and rushed conclusion on a railroad so that they could lead the player into Season 2. A Season 2 I didn't know was being planned.

In the end Mira dies or is a slave with no choice from Chapter 1-5 changing anything about her, your home will burn down no matter how much you bend the kneel or how much you rebel, and if TellTale thinks they're getting another $30 out of me for another season just to see this disappointment again they have another thing coming.

&gt; Feel what it is like to play the Game of Thrones, where you winor you die

The Steam page advertises this. There is no winning. There is only what TellTale wants.

It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, but just didn't hit me like it hit so many people.

Eventually, everyone started watching and reading everything GoT-related and due to amount of as*holes telling me to get into it, I didn't even wanted to hear about it anymore. 

Skip to Autumn 2015. After getting out of shows to watch, I caught the beginning or season 1 on TV. I give Season 1 a second chance. Watched an episode a day and right after it, Season 2. 

Now that I have finished season 2, I'd like to ask you guys a question, and please don't be offended, as maybe I lost part of it.

Is it really that rushed and badly explained in the series/books, or did I lose something? Maybe the version I watched was missing a few minutes or something.

Some of the most important events of season 1 (i.e.: Jamie's capture, Daenerys's childbirth, Robert's death) didn't even show at all. Like, Jamie's supposed to be a really good warrior, and we don't see how he lost. Suddenly they bring him as a prisoner. What if we never saw how Luke destroyed the Death Star, and the next scene is the rebels celebrating and saying ""Man, you totally did it!"" ?

I find this kind of stuff VERY anticlimactic, and honestly, this kind of things made the series much, much worse than what I expected. Does this happen in the books as well? Or, since it was on TV, maybe they have cut something?

EDIT: before trolls come in, I should let this clear. I did like the seasons, but there were a few moments, like the ones mentioned (plus Drogo's death) that felt really rushed and left me thinking ""WTF"". ",62,0,False,self,,,,,

(Although I just started reading the books) Do the White Walker's have some type of chain of command/hierarchy? I know there is the White King or whatever he is called, but how did he get chosen as king? The reason I am asking is because I have a theory on Stannis. Let's assume Stannis really is dead, which I believe he is. Melisandre has said on several occasions that he will sit on the Iron Throne and that she has seen it. I know not everything she sees in the fire happens, but what if Stannis does sit on the Iron Throne... as the king of the White Walkers? Melisandre would be correct, but the context of the situation would obviously not be what Stannis had in mind.

Let's play this out... Let's assume the White Walker's leadership is based on who is most capable to lead an army instead of bloodlines. If the walkers happen upon Stannis's body and they resurrect him, it would seem obvious, (based on the theory of leadership) that Stannis would assume control of the army since he is a proven, battle tested leader. They then sack King's Landing and a dead Stannis walks in and sits on the throne.

I've read as much as I can on the matter and I haven't seen anything that would disprove this or prevent it from possibly happening. Maybe I missed something, but this would be a crazy twist to everything. From there you could have Dany arriving to a White Walker King's Landing and possibly Jon with the Northern armies descending on King's Landing from the north. Then the final battle rages with all armies trying to destroy the walkers and in effect, destroying King's Landing, and a lot of other cities, in the process. Dany and Jon are then tasked with rebuilding everything similar to their ancestors when they first arrived in Westeros. (assuming R+L=J) This would then reign in a new era of Targaryen rule. I would be curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this. This is my first time posting here so my apologies if I did not do something correctly, or missed something that would obviously prevent this from happening.",8,2,False,self,,,,,

Just wondering if you might have some tips to win at the GOT Board Game. Especially if you're Baratheon (preferred House to play). Important things like: 
-who to form an alliance with
-is it vital to form an alliance? 
-Iron throne vs Fiefdom vs King's Court: Which is a priority
-When to muster, attack etc. 

Basically, i'm just asking what you do in order to win at the board game haha.

This is also badly ineloquent...I will try.

Anywho, I was piddling about in the bathroom thinking about GoT, which I just finished the latest season this afternoon (I've read the books a while ago and really, after a while, you can't rationally bitch people out for spoilers if you poke about the wrong places), and it was awesome, but it got me thinking about what happened to Shireen and Melisandre's thing about king's blood and also about old Valyrian blood magic, and then, randomly enough, I like history and so I was thinking about Oliver Cromwell and how he wasn't exactly a royal but he still ruled England for a while anyway. 

So my theory is that magic attributed to R'hllor is Valyrian blood magic rebranded as the power of the Lord of Light, and the emphasis on ""king's blood"" is really ""Valyrian blood."" We see many indications that the religion of the red god is all over Essos (literally, from Daenerys' first chapter), but not so much in Westeros. But I can't recall if at any point we see anyone (edit: in Essos) doing any kind of ritual like what Melisandre/Thoros do. Valyria occupies a position of dissolved glory, and ancient power, and so on--its real life equivalent is that of the Roman Empire. In the books, throughout the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay, there are a lot more people with classic Valyrian features. I don't know--would the average Slaver's Bay guttersnipe with white-gold hair and purple eyes also be eligible to be used as a sacrifice? Why? Whereas in Westeros, the only people who have Valyrian blood tend to be related to Targaryens. Similarly--would an Arryn with no relation to Targaryens qualify as 'king's blood' because once, long ago, they were Kings of Mountain and Vale? Would a Stark, for once having been Kings in the North? When Hot Pie takes the Iron Throne is he suddenly conferred the magical properties of king's blood?

But the point I'm making (poorly) is that there is so little understanding left in Westeros (and probably Essos) of lost Valyria that what is known about them is shrouded in myth and subject to misunderstanding. Look at how badly people understand history IRL. Aside from that, setting aside likelihood and so on, if a commoner seized the throne in Westeros and declared themselves the new ruler, would they suddenly become eligible for use as king's blood? Basically, I'm asking if it's possible to reevaluate this understanding of 'king's blood' from a default perception that it applies to kings only because the only people who qualify for sacrifice happen to be kings? And that religions in Westeros function basically like religion in real life does. It just kind of puts together a functional framework using what's available that people can be convinced to believe.

##5.03 - ""High Sparrow""

* Directed By: Mark Mylod
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 26, 2015

Margaery, newly wed to Tommen, manipulates her husband into planning to send Cersei to Casterly Rock. Baelish conducts Sansa Stark to Winterfell to cement an alliance with Roose Bolton through her marriage to his son Ramsay; Sansa will consolidate the Bolton hold on the North, while Baelish hints that an alliance between the North and the Vale would be capable of bringing down the kingdom. Jon Snow refuses Stannis' offer to make him Lord of Winterfell, and Stannis plans to leave for King's Landing via Winterfell. To adapt in the House of Black and White, Arya throws all her personal effects into the river except for Needle, which she hides in a pile of rocks. At Castle Black, Jon names Ser Allister First Ranger, but Janos Slynt refuses to follow Jon's orders that he leave to rebuild Greygard. Snow executes Slynt himself. Lancel finds the High Septon in a compromising situation in Littlefinger's brothel; in a purge, Cersei decides speak to the High Sparrow. Tyrion and Varys arrive in Volantis and visit a brothel, where Tyrion is abducted by Jorah Mormont.

##5.04 - ""Sons of the Harpy""

* Directed By: Mark Mylod
* Written By: Dave Hill
* Originally Aired: May 3, 2015

The Sparrows arrest Loras Tyrell. Margaery is enraged, but Tommen proves too weak to arrange his release. Melisandre tries to seduce Jon Snow in an attempt to convince Snow to go to Winterfell with Stannis. In the crypts of Winterfell, Baelish reveals he has been summoned to return to King's Landing by Cersei. Before leaving, he tries to dispel Sansa's misgivings towards Ramsay Bolton, telling her that even if Stannis does not defeat the Boltons and rescue her, she can easily manipulate Ramsay. Bronn and Jaime land secretly in Dorne; they encounter and kill four horsemen, then use their clothes and gear as disguises. The Sand Snakes learn from a sea captain that Jaime has come to Dorne for Myrcella; Ellaria convinces the Sand Snakes to plan to avenge the death of Oberyn by abducting Myrcella before Jaime can intervene. Ser Jorah plans to redeem himself to Daenerys by giving Tyrion to her as a prisoner. In Meereen, Hizdahr zo Loraq makes another appeal to Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits; the Sons of the Harpy run amok and ambush an Unsullied patrol inside the citadel; Grey Worm is critically wounded and Ser Barristan is killed.

&gt;How'd you do it? Lance through the heart. Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait."" They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.

There was no other way.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3uu2zy/all_spoilerseverything_jon_snows_situation_has/,[deleted],1448878290,"It's been so obvious to me, for so long, that Jon would be murdered, eventually, and ultimately live, because that's just how the story has to move on. First of all, everything has pointed to him returning to Winterfell, from Maester Aemon talking to him about doing the right thing, and sharing his personal misery of his lost family, to his own personal disappointment with the watch, and his desire for Yggrette.

Secondly, if he didn't die, he could never leave the watch, which was holding him back. Plot line plateau. He needs to be the one who kills Ramsay, the bastard, and possibly Roose but I don't think so, so that Winterfell can return to ""Stark"" hands. He will likely then be legitimized by ~~Stannis~~ the show killed Stannis. So, the Northmen say, Hey this guy's Ned's son, and he's the last man alive with Stark blood! He's now Jon Stark, because f*** the king., thereby becoming Lord Stark. Bran's not going back, and Rickon is too young to be any good in a war, and Sansa is still too timid, even with her recent change, and Winterfell just can't go into the hands of another lord other than Stark. That would kill the story. Jon is, virtually, the only one who can unionize the north, again. The Northmen know him, and will very likely follow him in order to take down the Boltons.

 It was also obvious he'd be resurrected. It's not like Ned's situation, where he was virtually useless, anymore. Ned played his part, and it was upsetting, but where was it going with him? Nowhere, really. He wouldn't go to war with the Lannisters, shown apparent by his lack of will to leave with Renly. 

Moving on, Melisandre is there when Jon dies, and red priests have a history of resurrecting people... Yeah, coincidence that she happens to show up right before he gets stabbed? I don't think so. In the books she says that her visions show her Snow (with a capital ""s"") when she asks to be shown who Azor Ahai is. She knows it's him, even if it's not explicitly told. (I even think she was using Stannis to find the real Azor, and never really believed he was the one). But, that's neither here, nor there. Jon is likely resurrected by Melisandre. 

In the books there is presumably a dragon in the wall, which supposedly is supposed to fly out when the others come back. And, presuming that Jon is really Rhaegar and Lyanna's son, wouldn't it be so convenient that king's blood (Jon) spilled at the wall, like enough to awaken a sleeping dragon, and Melisandre was there to activate it with her red magic? Theory, but cool to think about. 

Anyways, everyone knew he would leave the night's watch, eventually. By murdering him they effectively relieved him of his oath. With Jon Snow now free to move on, he can fulfill his desire to be Lord Stark, the free-folk are starting to like him, and trust him, thereby able to join him in the war against the others (white walkers).

I was recently thinking about this, and Tyrion seems to be a pretty good candidate.

He has the blood of the dragon, considering his possible true origins (being the Mad King's son)
He was born from smoke in the Battle of Blackwater
He was born from salt when he sailed to Pentos... and the bleeding star is not the comet, but instead is Oberyn Martell, since House Martell's sigil is the sun, and the sun is a star.
He also, like Azor, killed a lion (Tywin) and his lover (Shae). 

I know, maybe it's a bit of a stretch.. but I was thinking about it and it blew my mind.
