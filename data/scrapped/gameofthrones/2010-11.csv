Here are a couple theories (that I'm sure aren't original) to start conversation:


1. The boy that Samwell meets at the Citadel at the end of book 4 is actually Jaqen.  The prologue begins with another Pate attempting to secretly sell a key to the Citadel to a sorcerer of sorts (if I remember correctly) in order to purchase Rosey, but Pate promptly dies after making the transaction.  During the transaction the sorcerer responds to the question ""Who are you?"" with ""No one, truly.""  Which reminds us of the faceless men from Braavos and Arya's training.  It appears that Jaqen, a wildcard of a character (what are his motives, how much does he know about the impending war?), could be a very central player in driving the plot.


2. Neither Gregor or Sandor is actually dead.  Gregor has been sustained by Qyburn in some sort of undead state (perhaps similar to what Catelyn is now) based on several hints he's dropped to Cersei about having a soldier no man could defeat.  Sandor on the otherhand was rescued by the elder brother on the Quiet Islands (who said he buried him with his own hands).  The gravedigger is said to be large, limping, and Dog shows him some affection (of course Dog would like The Hound).


Here are a couple other questions you could respond to with your own theories:

1. What word does Brienne shout when she's about to be hanged at the end of book 4?

2. Who will the other 2 dragon riders be alongside Dany (assuming Dany is one of the 3)?
