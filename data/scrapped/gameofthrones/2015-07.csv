Within Westeros, Petyr Baelish, a man who founded his very own house, is known as one of the actual players in the game among the very few. Others can say that Varys and possibly Daenerys are other players, but time and time again Petyr Baelish proves himself to us that he is in it to win it. Its quite obvious that Petyr is taking the unconventional way of gaining the throne, a way that doesn't come through succession or overtaking, but rather manipulation and deception. From the moment we first met him, Petyr has made some very risky and well thought out moves, slowly elevating himself higher upon the chairs; from boy, to lord, to Master of Coin, to Lord Protector of the Vale and Lord of Harrenhal.

**WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS**

With Season 5 ending, Petyr was absent from the back half. We were able to see Petyr put his plan of Sansa's marriage to the bastard child of the new Warden of the North, Ramsey Bolton. Sansa's marriage to Ramsey was one that meant to help the Boltons gain support among the Northerners. Baelish has been playing the pleasing game with both the Boltons and Lannisters, keeping both contenders happy. For Cersei, Petyr helped imprison Queen Margaery Tyrell and her brother Ser Loras Tyrell, the Flower Knight, due to their crimes against the Faith with Cersei's new zealot friends and Petyr's wildcard, Olyvar, the squire/pleaser. One of the later scenes we do see with Petyr involves a small chat with himself and Grand Mammy Olenna Tyrell, where she is quite upset with him because of his direct role in the imprisonment of her two grandchildren, and frankly, her only way to even have the slightest of holds upon the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. She is upset with him, of course, but in pure Baelish fashion, Petyr presents the idea that he has a gift for her quite similar to the one he gave Cersei, in the form of a young man. Many believe that this young man was Lancel Lannister, the boy who eventually led to Cersei's downfall and walk of shame. That may not be the case.

**CHAOS IS A LADDER**

In a direct quote from Baelish himself, chaos is a ladder, and he is pretty intent on climbing that ladder, no matter who's head act as rungs. That actually happens to be about every lord and lady in Westeros. We can see Baelish's alliegences are ones written on thin paper; although he delivered Sansa Stark, the key to the North, to the Boltons in order to help them gain a tighter grip upon the North, we know that by the time Season 6 roles around, Baelish and the men of the Vale may start marching to Wintefell to retake it. In the same sense, Baelish betrayed the Queen herself by allowing Olyvar to reveal Ser Loras's sexual orientation. Baelish fears no man, and he holds no alleigence to one either. However, in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3PSTvAbfac) scene between Olenna and Baelish, he makes it clear he intends to find a way to get at Cersei as well. Lancel, although the seemingly obvious candidate, should be outruled. Why would Baelish have to convince him to speak of Cersei's crimes? From his introduction at the wedding of Tommen and Margaery, Lancel is already a complete zealot, and seems to wish to repent his sins... all of his sins, especially those involving Cersei. He needs no pushing from another. If Baelish and his men of the Vale do intend to take Winterfell, giving Baelish the title of Warden of the North, they may not be all to successful. They won't make the same mistake as Stannis and be defeated, but they'll be beaten to it, if the [Grand Northern Conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1iwfc1/spoilers_all_the_grand_northern_conspiracy_parts/) is true. Baelish's attempts to grab a Northern seat may prove futile, but he has one last card to play, in the form of a young man. Hold onto your tinfoil, this is a big one: Gendry. The boy bastard of Robert Baratheon. 

**SMALL MOVEMENTS**

Yes, I am well aware Gendry may very well be an abandoned plotline, and I'm sure there are some waters that he has yet to row, but I truly believe there is the possibility of Gendry coming back into play. From the flashback in the beginning of Season Five, its been revealed that Cersei will find her demise after the death of her three children, and it will be her younger brother (although the show skipped that part) that will lead her to it. Well, after the finale, two out of the three have been picked off. All that remains is Tommen, the boy king who sits in his room crying day on end. Cersei has proved that she is more willing to allow her child to die then to allow them to live in some world she doesn't deem fitting, and that seems to be the realization she's coming to. In a personal opinion, it is very obvious that Cersei will be the downfall of Tommen, eventually leaving him to his death with no heir to take his spot, leaving chaos. Chaos. The wet dream of Petyr Baelish. Now, this is the part where it gets hazy. From there, Baelish could have very well found a way to have Gendry legitimized, being the only TRUE son of Robert Baratheon. Somehow, the Faith may find a way to back Gendry and Baelish, and from there he shall take his seat with Petyr Baelish as his Hand of the King (or in this case, Hand up the King's Ass working him like a puppet). Now, I know this is a stretch. A world record setting stretch, but GRRM has proved to us that he isn't afraid to unleash the unexpected. Sure, this may not be as fun a theory as the Cleganebowl, or as solid of one as R+L=J, but it has some solidity, and may lead to an interesting turn.",20,23,False,self,,,,,

I got to the first Jon chapter and found a particular line interesting. 

The line is a description of the dinner/feast that they were having at Winterfell the first night that the Baratheon squad showed up. 

It reads: ""A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations. ""

We know that Rhaegar was a musician and was a beast at playing the harp, and he could probably sing very well, too. His songs were said to bring the women at Summerhall to tears. 
Pewter is a grayish silver type color. The Starks sigil essentially is the color pewter. All of this being described in the first few sentences of the first Jon chapter. 

This obviously doesn't confirm anything and is just a theory, but could that possibly be GRRM hinting at a connection between Jon Snow, Rhaegar Targaryen, Lyanna Stark and R+L=J?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Yet, in GoT, choices are very important, and have determined the course of the war.  For this reason, I think it'd be cool to see a GoT game where you can sway events to happen wildly differently from the actual timeline of GoT.  A choose-your-own-adventure sort of thing.

I've been playing a lot of Fallout New Vegas, and I think a Fallout-style game would work excellently for GoT.  There's so many moments in Game of Thrones where we think ""what if ___ had done ___ instead?""  New Vegas's story is very fluid, so that you as a player can influence individuals in many different factions one way or another, so that the power-dynamic of the area is completely changed.  This would translate very well to the War of Five Kings.  For example, you could play as an outsider character who has free reign to ally with any of the canon characters and influence them in different ways.  You could convince Ned Stark to side with Littlefinger and declare Joffrey the rightful king instead of challenging him, then see how the story pans out if Ned hadn't been executed.  You could convince Jon to kill Ygritte and return to Castle Black with Qhorin Halfhand, then see what would have happened had Jon never joined the wildlings.  You could participate in either side of the Battle of the Blackwater and decide whether Stannis wins or loses.  You could also go completely rogue and just explore the cities and towns of Westeros/Essos doing your own thing.  Like Fallout, there'd be much room for character creation and role-playing, with all the different armor and weaponry in GoT (though I guess this would be a lot like Skyrim).",100,35,False,self,,,,,

Did Bron sell out Tyrion?

I can see his logic in not wanting to risk his life against the Mountain, but what bothers me most is that Shae is in King's Landing when he assured him he saw the ship leave with Shae on board. 

From the whole situation it seemed to me that Shae was playing Tyrion all along, another of his father's plots to make him suffer... pretty much the same thing he did with his first wife but made it last longer. 

So, was Bron in on it?

If anyone has any thoughts, criticisms, ideas, corrections, praises, insults, whatever, feel free to send them. 

House Dowell is a noble house from the Stormlands. It's seat is the Weeping Tower, at the southern shore of Cape Wrath along the Sea of Dorne.

House Dowell's claim to fame is it's breed of horses. It's famed for breeding the prized destriers which are renowned for their speed and endurance in battle, and are prized horses for both tourney and battle, sometimes even being considered too priceless to be sacrificed as war horses.

They are bannermen to the Baratheons, and their prized steeds contributed heavily to the cavalry forces of Robert Baratheon during Robert's Rebellion.

Also, bear in mind I'm taking an actual area from GRRM's lore as the seat of House Dowell for my little roleplay project, the Weeping Tower near Weeping Town. 

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Weeping_Town

I'm not sure that the rocky soil and increment weather of the Stormlands added to the fact that Weeping Town is a minor trade hub would be good for breeding horses: However, that's where my actual family line comes in. My grandfather was a genius with horses in a certain respect so this house is heavily inspired by him.

Anyhow, Lord Howland Dowell had a gift with horses. He was a private man, but was known to consort with maesters and others of very high intelligence. Nobody quite knows the secret of how House Dowell breeds such pristine animals, and this secret of breeding the strongest and best horses has kept House Dowell safe over it's existence even amidst rumors of Targaryen support during the conflict, and support of Renly Baratheon during the War of the Five Kings: Lords, contenders to the Iron Throne, and the Small Council may always question House Dowell's true loyalties, but they all want their prized steeds.

[House Dowell's sigil is a red horse's head on a field of silver.](http://i.imgur.com/5nyYy0L.png) That's a general idea of what the sigil looks like, but more of a rough draft and not final. Not sure on the house words yet.

79,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-7-1,2015,7,1,23,3br6r1,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] Let's talk about Tyrion (theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3br6r1/all_spoilers_lets_talk_about_tyrion_theory/,[deleted],1435760342,"I'm sure many of my fellow GOT subredditors are familiar with the A+J=T theory and for those who don't I'll make it quick: Basically the idea is that Tyrion is half Lannister half Targaryen. The Mad King raped Joanna and the end result was Tyrion. There isn't a whole ton of support for this theory other than a few mentions in the book about how the Mad King lusted after Joanna and made a few comments about her. 

With this post I wanted to explore why this theory makes sense and why I believe we see some sort of variation of this theory. 

1. Tyrion is the third head of the dragon. I think we can safely assume Dany is one, Jon (if R+L=J is canon) is the second, and so far we don't know who the third is. My thought is it must be Tyrion. Jon/Dany/Tyrion all killed their mothers during childbirth (and while that isn't all that important it does give them another thing in common). Yes the evidence here is sparse but Tyrion would fill that third head position so to speak. 

2. Tywin has an unnatural hate for Tyrion. We are told it is because Tyrion is a dwarf/killed is mother but Tywin isn't an illogical man. It seems highly out of character for Tywin to hate his own son just because he is a Dwarf. I tend to think if A+J=T is true, Tywin knew about it. That may be why he left Kings Landing for Casterly Rock near the time Tyrion was born. Not only is Tyrion not his son, he is the product of the Mad King and just so happened to kill his beloved wife. I don't think his hatred for Tyrion is as simple as ""he is short and killed my wife"" it is more like ""he is not my son, announcing he is the son of Aerys would bring shame upon my house, Aerys not only raped my wife but killed her in the process."" Also, ""you're no son of mine..."" (I know... I know I'm taking that way too literally...)

3. The red priestess seems to really like him in Season 5. Jon had Mel give him this crazy stare upon meeting him. We know these red priestesses can sniff out king's blood/power, and Jon and Tyrion would have that in droves if these two theories are correct. Check out this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D_9A2HqrMQ) start at 3:05... that stare is incredibly telling. I feel like having a scene where a red priestess  not only notices Tyrion but stares him down is incredibly important, especially if they are constantly concerned with finding powerful blood. 

4. Tyrion is always talking about how much he wants to see a dragon. Although probably not alone in his obsession (I would liken it to kids wanting to see dinosaurs...) but I do feel adding this piece of information about Tyrion is telling and possibly important. (At this point I may actually be wearing a tinfoil crown).

Alright anyone fee like discussing? I feel like this would be the coolest/ most fulfilling thing to happen.  Tyrion seems like a compassionate guy (described kind of like a Targaryen when the coin flip was favorable), he appears to be one of the main characters (did I just doom him by saying that?), and he is a great ruler. I'd be happy if the three main characters Jon, Dany, and Tyrion ended up saving the world from the Others! ",1,1,False,default,,,,,

Watching season 2, she gives  Sansa some advice re only loving her children and no one else. Cersei loves her children more than anything in the world and as Tyrion remarked ""it is her only redeeming quality."" With Myrcella recently dead and Joffrey gone, Cersei is losing everything in the world she loves and is being tormented with the prospect of outliving all of her young children before she reaches middle age. Losing a child would be incomprehensible, but losing another, one after the other in such a short amount of time must surely been more pain than one can handle. It gives me solace that the pain of losing her children is far worse than death and that ultimately, when she is killed, it won't be without having endured an even worse situation than she is facing at the moment. This however highlights another important aspect, i.e. what will she do when she finds out about Myrcella and who will feel the wrath?

The Mad King raped Joanna and the end result was Tyrion. There isn't a whole ton of support for this theory other than a few mentions in the book about how the Mad King lusted after Joanna and made a few comments about her. 

With this post I wanted to explore why this theory makes sense and why I believe we see some sort of variation of this theory. 

1. Tyrion is the third head of the dragon. I think we can safely assume Dany is one, Jon (if R+L=J is canon) is the second, and so far we don't know who the third is. My thought is it must be Tyrion. Jon/Dany/Tyrion all killed their mothers during childbirth (and while that isn't all that important it does give them another thing in common). Yes the evidence here is sparse but Tyrion would fill that third head position so to speak. 

2. Tywin has an unnatural hate for Tyrion. We are told it is because Tyrion is a dwarf/killed is mother but Tywin isn't an illogical man. It seems highly out of character for Tywin to hate his own son just because he is a Dwarf. I tend to think if A+J=T is true, Tywin knew about it. That may be why he left Kings Landing for Casterly Rock near the time Tyrion was born. Not only is Tyrion not his son, he is the product of the Mad King and just so happened to kill his beloved wife. I don't think his hatred for Tyrion is as simple as ""he is short and killed my wife"" it is more like ""he is not my son, announcing he is the son of Aerys would bring shame upon my house, Aerys not only raped my wife but killed her in the process."" Also, ""you're no son of mine..."" (I know... I know I'm taking that way too literally...)

3. The red priestess seems to really like him in Season 5. Jon had Mel give him this crazy stare upon meeting him. We know these red priestesses can sniff out king's blood/power, and Jon and Tyrion would have that in droves if these two theories are correct. Check out this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D_9A2HqrMQ) start at 3:05... that stare is incredibly telling. I feel like having a scene where a red priestess  not only notices Tyrion but stares him down is incredibly important, especially if they are constantly concerned with finding powerful blood. 

4. Tyrion is always talking about how much he wants to see a dragon. Although probably not alone in his obsession (I would liken it to kids wanting to see dinosaurs...) but I do feel adding this piece of information about Tyrion is telling and possibly important. (At this point I may actually be wearing a tinfoil crown).

Alright anyone fee like discussing? I feel like this would be the coolest/ most fulfilling thing to happen.  Tyrion seems like a compassionate guy (described kind of like a Targaryen when the coin flip was favorable), he appears to be one of the main characters (did I just doom him by saying that?), and he is a great ruler. I'd be happy if the three main characters Jon, Dany, and Tyrion ended up saving the world from the Others! ",194,161,False,self,,,,,

Perhaps the reason the family is so incestual is because only Targaryen women can survive the pangs of childbirth. 

Now some of you may be thinking what about Elia Martell who was married to Rhaegar and birthed 2 children. Thing is we know Rhaegar didn't like his wife and loved Lyanna Stark so for all we know those may not be his actual kids.

This would be Jon's role in the story, he would become the Mance Rayder of Westeros.

I know the Winterfell story, especially Sansa's part, has been discussed a lot, but I believe I have a good reason for why it had to play out as it did.  The speculation will be more focused on Sansa/Dany/Littlefinger's stories.  Here it goes.

It's probably best to start at the beginning, with Sansa in the Vale.  In one scene, we saw how affectionate the Lords Declarant of the Vale are for her.  We also know that her essentially giving Littlefinger the thumbs up, got them to trust him a bit more.

Jump ahead to Littlefinger leaving her with the Boltons.  He had no idea how bad Ramsay was.  While this is debatable if it's realistic or not, it is also another vital piece.

Last we saw, Littlefinger was in King's Landing and Sansa was fleeing with Theon.  I do believe that Sansa and Theon will find sanctuary in one of the Northern houses.  Littlefinger will finally get word on what is happening up North and head back to the Vale (perhaps his jetpack has ran out of fuel if they need it to drag for an episode or two), to rally their fresh forces.  The Lords Declarant will readily agree, as we saw how much they care about Sansa.  So most of the Vale forces head north to find Sansa/destroy the Boltons.

So now on to part two of this speculation.  I believe Dany will survive and rally the Dorthraki she was surrounded by, head back to Meereen, gather the rest of her forces and head west.  She and the rest will be debating on the best place to land, when Varys points out that taking one of the only areas in Westeros that could sustain her and her people is the Vale, the only area relatively untouched by the War of the Five Kings.

Here's another reason why I think her landing in the Vale could happen:  Back during the War of Conquest of Aegon I, his sister landed her dragon in the Eyrie courtyard. At the time, they had a boy ruler.  When his mother came out, she found him sitting on Visenya's knee and he asked if he could go fly on the dragon. At the current time in the story, the Vale is ""ruled"" by a boy who is obsessed with flying. 

So Dany et. al land in a pretty defenseless Vale.  She gives Robyn a fly or two to placate him and claims the Vale as hers. 

Now, even if Littlefinger or whomever were able to split up the Vale troops and try to send some of them back, they have to go through Tyrion's still rather well-equpped Mountain Clans to even try to get back home, if they really feel like taking on a dragon or three.

Dany is now sitting pretty in one of the only untouched areas of Westeros, supplies for her people and everyone soon hearing the dragons have officially returned to Westeros.

TL;DR: Sansa had to be treated like crap, so Littlefinger would mobilize the Vale forces, leaving the Vale ripe for Dany's picking.",16,11,False,self,,,,,

One could be that some really good casting of fine actors have brought many characters to life beyond their book versions.  Another is that although the book often featured characters alone, the screenwriters have consistently created ""road  pairings"" of characters and these have been very successful - including, of course Tyrion/Bronn, Brienne/Jaime, Brienne/Pod, Jorah/Dany, Jorah/Tyrion, Bronn/Jaime, and maybe the best: Arya/Hound. The banter of these road pairings is a hallmark of the show.  I think we are set for some interesting ones in season six.  The first is obvious:  
  - Daario &amp; Jorah - they both love her - but Jorah has been friendzoned, while Daario has had the benefits.  They are both among the best fighters functioning now, but they probably won't fight each other - or will they? - it's like a romantic tease - will they get it on or not?
  - Sansa &amp; Theon/Reek - childhood friends who may only be saved by finding that friendship even though theyv'e both been through sooo much.  He betrayed everything she holds dear - but at least she can trust him not to try anything.  
  - Davos &amp; Melisandre or Davos &amp; Jon (resurrected) - I think Davos takes resurrected Jon to White Harbor which is not so far away to Wyman Manderly - who may know the secret of Jon's parentage - or they may meet Howland Reed there who knows.  Melisandre - if Davos doesn't kill her - will try and stick with Jon.  I don't expect Melisandre to live long, but she and Davos as traveling companions is pretty juicy stuff.  
  - Bronn &amp; Trystane - this is even more speculative, but I think Ellaria is going to kill Doran and then she'll send the Sand Snakes to kill Trystane.  Somehow I think Bronn is going to wind up with Trystane and stuck in the position of defending him against some bad pussy.

Then, the finale should be a blockbuster feature film called ""Ice and Fire"" or something.  This movie would obviously make a ton of money, since established franchises do well and GoT fans would HAVE to watch the conclusion.  So it should be big big budget.

With that big budget, they should ""Hollywood"" their sets, costumes, and CGI.  For example, a proper sized iron throne.  The nature of these changes would be obvious.  Like, ""oh, this is a feature film so they had a bigger budget.""  No one would ask, ""what happened to the iron throne?""  In fact, the throne itself could be the chief selling point for ""big budget game of thrones"".  Symbolic of it, if you will.

And, once the movie is made, all the physical and CGI assets can be reused for spin offs.  [AGOT](#b ""So young Ned will meet young Jamie sitting on the ""big"" throne for the HBO Roberts rebellion mini series."")",7,1,False,self,,,,,

You get a lot of internal monologues that the show can provide that really gets you that much more emotionally invested.  Like when Arya remembered the time Robb brought them down to the crypts to show them their tombs and Jon, covered in flour, scared them causing Bran to cry on Robb's leg and Sansa running off shrieking.  Or when Jon thought Ned may return to Winterfell after Robert's death and he thinks ""I will ask him about my mother, I am a man now, it is past time he told me.  Even if she was a whore, I don't care, I want to know.""  And Sansa staring at Janos Slynt in court wishing some hero would throw him down and cut off his head.  And then Greatjons speech near the end, calling Robb ""The King in the North.""

Azor Ahai pushed the White Walkers back North, and is said to come again in Westeros' greatest time of need.

We can assume the White Walkers know of this prophesy as well, and that they must be on the lookout for Azor Ahai. They are weak to the common obsidian, but only Azor wielded a sword that could slaw a White Walker.

Or so they think. In Hardhome, we found out it was wrong. You do not need a sword that was hammered on for 100 days quelled in the heart of a lover, all you need is Valerian steel.

Yet, as far as we are aware, Jon Snow slaying the White Walker was the first and only time that Valyrian Steel has been used against White Walkers. At the time of the first invasion of the frozen dead, the Valyrians were goat herders, their discovery of dragons was still one or two thousand years away. The White Walker Jon slayed was as surprised as Jon was that Long Claw stopped the ice spear.

So, the White Walkers do not know about their own weakness to Valyrian Steel. Seeing this leader, who rallies the wildings and the Crows under one banner, who wields a blade of steel that can kill them, they come to one conclusion, Jon Snow is Azor Ahai.

That is why the Ice King came down the hill and taunted Jon so personally by raising all the Wildings at once, to bring such despair to Jon and Jon alone. He saw Jon as their greatest enemy reborn, not knowing that anyone swinging a blade forged by Valyrian magic and dragon fire could do the same.",1,1,False,default,,,,,

This will be based on the assumption that this will be the penultimate season, with 7 being the last. There's a lot that could happen.

Various potential/suggested subplots include:
-Euron Greyjoy and the Valyrian Horn
-Jon's Parentage/Tower of Joy
-Jon's Resurrection and/or the aftermath of the NW betrayal (Pissed off Tormund anybody?)
-Sam's Journey to Oldtown and becoming a Maester(if there's only 7 seasons, this will probably go well past AFFC/ADWD)
-Sansa and the Umbers, (with Brienne maybe being the reason they get there?)
-Arya's continued training/Mercy/Next Victim
-CLEGANEBOWL (IT'S FUCKING CONFIRMED GET HYPE)
-Tommen probably dying at some point to fulfill Cersei's prophecy
-Dany's potential new Khalasar and finally deciding to go to Westeros at some point damnit
-At least one of the other 2 dragon riders
-Bran learning all the things
-Jorah's Inevitable Death
-The White Walker Doom marching on the Wall
-Tyrion ruling Mereen alongside Varys
-Aftermath of Myrcella's death

Here's my predictions(I watch and read, so I have dual influences here):

Episode 1: Night Gathers
-Aftermath of Jon's death (NW mutiny or Wildlings coming to slaughter them)
-The BWB (no Stoneheart, sadly I don't think it'll happen, they'll all just be outlaws)
-Cersei plotting her survival via Ser Robert Strong
-The High Sparrow learning of Cersei's plan, and a potential champion for the Faith
-Dany's time with new Khal and Khalasar

Episode 2: The Crow's Eye
-Intro of Euron
-Bran's continued training as a warg
-Arya as ""Mercy""
-Septon Meribald scene and speech
-Boltons learn of the NW mutiny via letter from LC Alliser Thorne

Episode 3: Dawn
-Sam telling Gilly about Robert's Rebellion and Ser Arthur Dayne
-Bran sees the past and learns of Jon's true parentage
-Tower of Joy scene
-Jon on the funeral pyre (Either loyal NW or Wildlings put him there)
-Melisandre saying the words (maybe sacrificing herself for the ""death paying for life""; like LSH and Beric)
-Jon's eyes open, end of episode, thousands of fans cry tears of joy

Episode 4: Lord of Light
-Intro of new Red Priestess in Meereen
-Jon kills Alliser, becomes 1,000th LC
-Revived Jon knows who he is (R+L=J), but chooses to stay and fight the White Walkers(no vows)
-Euron has a red priest or priestess, shows off the horn that can tame dragons, makes speech

Episode 5: Valonqar
-Sansa reaching Last Hearth and finding Rickon and Osha
-Tommen's death(maybe suicide, idk but that's just my hunch)
-CLEGANEBOWL

Episode 6: Oldtown
-Sam reaches Oldtown
-Gilly goes to the Tarlys
-The new king is placed on the throne(it won't last long whoever it is)

Episode 7: Here We Stand
-Ser Jorah one way or another meeting his end (prolly saving Dany)

Episode 8: Our Blades Are Sharp
-Arya, now almost a fully realized assassin, is sent to Westeros
-The Grand Northern Conspiracy happens, Littlefinger arrives and fucks shit up
-Ramsay dead, Roose sent to the wall
-North rallies behind Sansa

Episode 9: Winter
-White raven at KL announcing the official start of Winter
-Dany returns to Mereen with new Khalasar, rallies all of her allies, including Daario, Varys and Tyrion, and off they go to Westeros
-Roose arrives at Castle Black and is shocked to see Jon Sn- ahem, Targaryen
-Jon, now total badass, spares Roose because he can, sends him to Eastwatch(as he learned from Stannis)
-Night's King shows up outside the wall with big giant horn
-Jon and NK meet one-on-one, NK has Horn of Joramun, wants Jon to surrender for a quick death, Jon basically tells him to fuck off
-Jon returns to Castle Black, tells everyone to prepare for war, they evacuate to some sort of minimum safe distance(Like Winterfell maybe?), sending word to Eastwatch and Shadow Tower to do the same

Episode 10: The Long Night
-Reunion of Jon and Sansa
-Sansa and Jon together call upon the North to fight the inevitable coming battle
-Snow begins to fall in KL
-Dany is betrayed by Daario who is *GASP* not such a nice guy after all
-The Night's King has the horn blown
-The Wall comes down
-The Night's King stands in the rubble of the wall as the army of the dead marches South
-End of season

EDIT: I left out Dorne and Jamie because tbh I really have no clue where they might go with all of that at this point in the show. It just seems really like all Dorne was for was to kill off Myrcella, but we'll see...

EDIT #2: Season 7 Titles and Speculation

Episode 1: Ice
-Most of Westeros freezing over by this point, no crops etc.
-Daenerys starts to conquer the Free Cities
-Bloodraven dies and Bran takes his place in the Weirwood tree

Episode 2: For The Night Is Dark...
-Sun is basically non-visible at this point
-Dany learns in the Free Cities that the WW have invaded westeros, snow is falling in Braavos and Pentos
-Arya returns to Westeros, but does so under the guise of her new face, since she has chosen to leave her old self behind
-Jon and the Northerners need Valyrian steel, so they send a request to all the lords and ladies in Westeros begging them to send their weapons to the north along with soldiers
-Stupid Summer people don't listen and Jon receives nothing

Episode 3: ...And Full of Terrors
-The White Walkers are seen slaughtering and raising people from the dead throughout the North
-Jon Snow knows that Daenerys will soon be upon KL, so he decides to ride south and beg for her help
-We somehow learn that Arya was sent to assassinate Jon (In other words the many-faced god is the WW/armies of the undead)

Episode 4: The Prince That Was Promised
-Bran looks into the past/future and sees a battle of Azor Ahai against the White Walkers(we won't know if this the past one, or the coming one)
-Bran then immediately sees the ""PTWP"" scene with Rhaegar
-Jon continues on his journey south (he's not Littlefinger so he can't teleport)
-Arya and Sansa have a reunion of sorts (without Sansa realizing who it is)
-Daenerys and her armies amass on ships and prepare to enter Westeros through Dorne(after receiving word that Doran will ally with her)

Episode 5: The Conqueror
-Some time later...
-Dany is marching on King's landing with a massive host, and under threat of dragons, most of the Southern lords bend the knee to her without bloodshed
-As this happens Bran is able to see Viserion through the Weirwoods, and is able to successfully (if only briefly warg into him)
-Dany enters King's landing without resistance, until the Faith Militant try and stop her because of her association with the Res Priestess, as a result (she's kinda going mad at this point), she has the FM all burned by Drogon, and she storms the Red Keep on his back, burning through the roof of the RK, and fulfilling part of her vision in Season 2/ACOK
-Jamie is probably killed here

Episode 6: For The Realm
-Jon arrives in post-conquering KL, presents himself to Dany with the story of his parentage and the horror of the WW in the North
-Dany decides to ""test"" Jon with Drogon, and at that time Rhaegal intervenes (this will be his dragon now), Dany is shocked and sends Jon with a portion of her armies to go deal with the WW problem
-Jon begs Dany to forget the Iron Throne and bring her entire army and all three dragons, but she refuses, (now definitely mad), claiming that it would seem as though Jon was conspiring to take her throne
-Jon sadly leaves knowing that even with a dragon and more soldiers it might not be enough
-Back at Winterfell, the White Walkers, seemingly still miles away, appear, along with a resurrected dragon, an ""Ice"" dragon (really just a dead dragon brought back)
-Arya is brutally killed by the Night's King, who removes her fake face, and he mounts it (her head) on a spike at Winterfell's front gate for Jon to see (at this point the White Walkers temporarily retreat(he's basically mocking Jon's efforts)

Episode 7: Dreams of Spring
-Bran, knowing what is happening to the South, tries to look further into the future to see the end of the war, but he is unable to see anything, only darkness, and he takes this to mean that the WW will inevitably win
-Meanwhile, Jon returns to Winterfell and is horrified by what he finds, blaming himself for leaving them all there
-Sansa is nowhere to be seen either (none of the bodies are) apparently (or so Jon thinks) made into one of the army of the undead, this has crushed him
-Dany is back in KL falling deeper and deeper into madness, Viserion leaves KL, which she calls it being ""a traitor""
-When Jon gathers what small force he has, he decides that it's now or never, and that when the WW come, they'll either fight them off or die

Episode 8: Battle For The Dawn
-The episode opens with Jon on the back of Rhaegal, waiting outside Winterfell along with his army for the WW
-Viserion (that we learn is being controlled by Bran, arrives to the battlefield)
-White Walker army marches in fast (like in Hardhome, but like 1000 times more massive and scarier)
-fighting is brutal and bloody, and Jon is obviously losing
-Jon notices that the Night's King is watching on from the back of his army, with none other than Sansa at his side, who is now a ""Night's Queen"" (Look up the Night's King on the wiki for this reasoning)
-Jon is almost lost in his fury,and tries to rush in towards the NK (Bran/Viserion is busy fighting the ice dragon, but eventually B/V is overpowered and Bran is forced to return to himself as Viserion is killed)
-As Jon almost gets the NK close enough for Rhaegal to burn, the NK simply touches Rhaegal, who instantly begins to die and freeze, Jon is horrified, but climbs off and tries to engage him in one on one battle, he successfully stabs the NK through the heart, pulls out his sword and waits...
-And nothing happens, the Night King smiles at Jon's failure and moves to kill him, but Jon in a final moment of mercy, kills ""White Walker"" Sansa, who he loved (hey he's got a thing for redheads)
-This like Nissa Nissa gives Jon's Longclaw the power it needs, and Jon kills the Night's King
-Slowly but surely all of the undead return to being dead and Jon falls into the snow exhausted but victorious

Episode 9: Fire
-Jon is brought back to the Red Keep by Dany on the back of Drogon
-When Jon awakes he is in the dungeon of the Red Keep, having been imprisoned by the Mad Queen Dany for ""treason for killing her dragons""
-Varys arrives at Jon's cell and tells him about what he said to Ned Stark when he was in that same cell, and let's Jon go, telling him ""I'm no hero. I'm doing this simply for the good of the realm."" and urges him to do what must be done
-Tyrion is used to lure Dany out of the throne room somehow, and when she is away from Drogon's reach, Jon is waiting for her with Longclaw in hand, and she realizes too late what has happened, Dany begs him to spare her, and Jon kills her with Longclaw, crying while he does it, knowing he is killing the only direct living relative he has(not to mention going against everything his surrogate father had taught him)
-Ends with Dany's body being burned on a funeral pyre

Episode 10: The Song of Ice And Fire
-A bit of an aftermath episode
-Jon (now the only Targaryen) has Drogon melt down the Iron Throne
-Jon goes and sees Sam, who is now a fully-realized Maester, and tells him everything
-Sam writes it all down in a history book he's been the writing about the events of the past 200 years or so
-Jon leaves, telling Sam that he doesn't know if he'll ever be able to recover from the horror he dealt with
-Jon leaves to wander the world, apparently he never got over the people that he lost, went mad (partly as a result of his Targaryen blood), and took his own life because he was afraid he was becoming like the other Targs before him. ""And with that, the Targaryen and Stark lines were ended. Robert may have tried to remove them from history, but they would never be forgotten thanks to Rhaegar and Lyanna, and Jon and Sansa and Daenerys. For theirs was the Song of Ice and Fire. And now their song has ended.""

EDIT #3: I forgot to mention, I think Euron will end up being an ally of Dany's along with the Ironborn, but she may roast him during the conquering of KL.",105,156,False,self,,,,,

Arya says she wants to learn to kill like Jaqen. He says she must come with her across the Narrow Sea and is fully aware of her kill list, saying ""a girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, Ilyn Payne, The Hound. Names to offer to the Red God. She could offer them all, one by one.""

She then explains that she would like to come with him, but she needs to go find her family, at which point he gives her the coin.

For those who don't remember the scene, see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVxdbNTsYGE

At the end of season 5, we see Arya punished and apparently blinded for killing for herself, although Jaqen was well aware of her intentions to do this. Does anyone have a potential explanation for this? Was it simply the use of the face that was the issue?

Additionally, we see a brief discussion of Arya's dancing master, who was also from Bravos, lending credence to the theory that Jaqen and Syrio Forel are one in the same.",24,14,False,default,,,,,

When the page is loaded the database is queried and runs counts of current numbers for everything selected. So when you see a number, that's the count of people currently using that flair.

Data was automatically as close as possible to 18:00 UTC - usually &lt;3 minutes later.    
The changes are miniscule, and it's rare for large groups to actually have less members week-to-week due to new people joining, but you can use other metrics like the percentages of the total or of the total changes week-to-week to give a small indication of how users may have reacted to the episodes.

Not sure why there are no new lines in Notepad like there are in Notepad++. You will probably need to check that the extraction was correct or do it yourselvers; most of it was automatically processed with regular expressions, but some of it was manual. You could make it easier by only using the alread-ranked numbers at the bottom, but these are some of the highest flairs, not all. Any software you use should be able to separate the numbers into new cells by using the delimiter ""/"". KJHatch added even more options early in the season, and my posts may explain the relative flood of new users that came one week.

A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was a tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded ees, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudlyy at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpre. ""The queen is angry too,"" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. ""Father took the king down to the crpyts this afternoon. The queen didn't want him to go.""

Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. ""You don't miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.""

-Book 1
-----------------

Jon's perceptive, because he's trepidatious about people's perceptions of him, because he is a bastard. So, why couldn't he see Olly's hateful intentions?

-- Depressed about Ygritte's death. Dulls attention. 

-- Stressing about defeating the white walkers. Focuses attention elsewhere.

--Here's the theory part: That ever since Ygritte, he no longer felt inferior and as cautious about people's intentions because she made him feel like he fitted in.

I think it's important because being a bastard was Jon Snow's original and deepest internal conflict. 

Also a possible parallel to Tyrion falling in love with a whore (not Shay, before that when he was younger) and him being able to counsel Snow to wear his bastardness like armor, as Tyrion had learned to with his dwarfism after feeling like he fitted in due to love.

With the show constantly taking on new plots and twists, things were looking a little Stark for our beloved one true king, Stannis of the house Baratheon. However, the below is why it's not too late to hope to see The Mannis rise to the top:



10.) Game of Thrones is constantly toying with expectations. Stannis, according to the showrunners, has done ""the worst possible thing a character can do"", which they used to justify his apparent demise. However, thinking back with this logic, Joffrey would have been immediately struck down after having Ned Stark executed. Westeros has no real sense of higher-power justice, leaving Brienne's retribution feeling a little forced and artificial.

9.) Stannis is still alive in the books, as per the revealed chapters in TWOW. The show killing Stannis before the books kill Stannis would be the largest character death deviation from the source material. While I understand that D&amp;D know where the books are headed, the fate of the Battle of Winterfell (teased for some time now) is much more carefully planned in the books then what the show portrayed. Perhaps Littlefinger's soldiers will lead the true battle while Stannis heals.

8.) While Davos and Melisandre have worked their way up to near leading roles, their story with Stannis out of the picture would be rather lackluster. The character development has been limited to how they help Stannis and their interactions with him. The show will lose an entire segment that it has spent a lot of time on in the past 4 seasons.

7.) What is not shown may never die. Every main character death has been shown and absolute. Why choose to leave our Mannis out in the cold? Stannis knows that hard truths cut both ways; he would never shy away from death, why would the showrunners choose not to show his unless there were plans for keeping him around?

6.) Melisandres magic is strong; whether or not she was responsible for the deaths of the other kings in the War of the Five Kings, we have seen absolute proof that her magic is real. She saw visions of Stannis as king; even if Brienne executed him, perhaps he would be resurrected as the Nights King and lead the White Walkers to Kings Landing.

5.) Brienne is bound by honor. While she hates Stannis, killing an unarmed man is not her way. Renly was a good man, and he was important to her, but when Brienne finally met Stannis in person you could see her doubting her beliefs. The man she had made out to be a monster has some monstrous qualities, but ultimately was shown to stand by his convictions. This may have swayed Brienne to keep him alive (at least for a little while).

4.) Go on, do your duty. These words may have further triggered Brienne into keeping Stannis alive; her duty is to protect Sansa Stark. Presenting Stannis alive to the Boltons would make for good leverage to protect Sansa. Predictions for the plot here may involve Stannis and Brienne running into Reek and Sansa outside Winterfell. These four would make for some very interesting character developments, and Stannis associating with the common people may make him a more grounded king. A humble, new man.

3.) Shireen may not have been Stanniss birth child. This is an exciting development that I have been waiting to see explored in the show, and would be a shame to not see come to fruition. All Baratheons have black hair, and we all know Shireen did not. This is perhaps why burning her alive did not work; she had no Kings blood. Stannis realizing this would have been a tragic, touching moment on the show, as well as opening the doors for a reintroduction of the long-time missing Gendry.

2.) Death by fire is the purest death. Stannis has chosen the path of light, not the darkness. Stannis is an end game player, and so is Daenerys Targaryen. Imagine Stannis with a newly formed army, going out fighting against Dany and her dragons. This is especially poignant considering that Stannis was assigned to murder the Khaleesi when she was only a baby.

1.) He is the rightful king of Westeros, and was Ned Starks pick for king. He smashed Mance Rayder at the Wall, held Storms End against the power of the Reach for a year, and seized Dragonstone from the Targaryens. Much lies ahead for Stannis Baratheon, for his is the fury.

Here's what worries me though: 

*[From Grrrrm's blog](http://grrm.livejournal.com/427713.html)*

&gt;David and Dan and Bryan and HBO are trying to make the best television series that they can.

&gt;And over here I am trying to write the best novels that I can.

&gt;And yes, more and more, they differ. Two roads diverging in the dark of the woods, I suppose... but all of us are still intending that **at the end we will arrive at the same place**.

*[From a D&amp;D interview](http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/game-of-thrones-ending-season-5-producers-interview-1201469516/):*

&gt; Were getting close to the ending, and there is that huge desire to **get it right**.

For all the differences between the two mediums *(creatively, it made sense to us...)*, we can agree that D&amp;D want to stay faithful to the ending GRRM has laid out.

Barring some miracle, however, GRRM's ending won't be available to us by the end of the projected seven seasons.

Um. I don't want to know the ending until I read it.

""Don't watch the show then!""

... Or go on the internet? Until ADOS is released?

This really worries me, especially because of that first quote. Gurmage himself has stated that as much as the paths diverge, they're aiming for the same target.

""The books and the show are so different, etc. etc."" - My point is this. If the end of the show ends with Cersei falling in love with Tyrion and dancing on Jaime's corpse, but *all* the details leading up to it are completely different, and the *books* end the same way, even though it could take a completely different path - ***It will feel like a spoiler and be extremely unsatisfying.***

Does anybody else hope that he changes his mind and gives us a different ending?

Edit: Let me clarify something. I don't have the answer to this problem. All I have is a suggestion. I'm sure there's a better solution, but I maintain that this is a problem. Also, if you think my point isn't valid, by all means - downvote the shit out of me - but don't downvote just because you disagree.

Jorah replies with ""The Dothraki follow strength above all Khaleesi. You'll have a true Khalasar when you prove yourself strong, and not before.""

Seems like a bit of foreshadowing, now that she's run into a true Khalasar and she holds a city, Drogon is a buttload bigger etc?

The soul sapping virus within me (perhaps its from Asshai) offers a theory which Im throwing out there into the fighting pit of theoretic frenzy on everyones favourite Snow:

1. Jon Snow as we knew him is dead, but hell be back. He just wont be the exactly same person, as previous examples of revivals have shown (a la Dondarrion and Stoneheart). Theyre always a bit different when they come back, but so long as hes a bit more animated than the Khal Drogo effort, we can gloss over the fine print cant we?

2. Whether he is Azor Ahai or not is yet to be seen, but if he is half Targaryen, and especially of the future dragon riding variety, then he probably isnt going to have a problem with fire, so;

3. When his traitor brothers stick him on the funeral pyre, what if he doesnt actually burn because hes Jon Snow-Targaryen afterall and they dont get burnt do they, and hes back (thanks to Melisandre), and look his swords aflame now just like Stanniss was supposed to be; and

4. Hes technically been dead now, so his Watch has ended and hes no longer bound to his oath. Because really, weve got two more books and who knows how many seasons of the tv show to get through  and if this whole Ice and Fire thing is about Jon Snow then we cant afford to have him moping about on the Wall feeling guilty for being alive the whole time.

(X-Post /r/ASOIAF),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3bzlv3/all_spoilers_spoilers_all_questions_regarding_the/,[deleted],1435928244,"Yeah, yeah. This is yet another ""What if Stannis still has a chance"" thread, but hear me out.

    We see that the Boltons ""massacre"" Stannis' depleted army, but one of the things on my mind while watching the episode for the first time was that Stannis managed to successfully make his way back to the forest, with only two Bolton soldiers trailing him (shouldn't there be a lot more?). Also, no Bolton soldier appears to be remotely near Brienne. When we see Ramsay, there was only (IIRC) one guard next to him as he finishes off a Baratheon straggler. It seemed to me that the Bolton army was actually almost annihilated as well. Why aren't there more Bolton troops near Ramsay? If they were off searching for Stannis, why isn't there a hint of them? Could Stannis' army have successfully inflicted enough losses for the Boltons to have suffered a pyrrhic victory? A pyrrhic victory that leaves them extremely vulnerable to the rest of the North and/or Littlefinger?

    I thought we would get caught up with Littlefinger. Is it possible that he's already in the North (cue teleporter jokes)? When I saw the Bolton army, my thought at first glance was that they were actually the Knights of the Vale, given the high number of calvalry. I mean, aside from the deserted sellsword army theory, why else would the Boltons have so many fresh horses?

    If Ramsay and his men returned to Winterfell moments before Theon and Sansa manage to escape, how are we to believe that Theon and Sansa are going to successfully escape in the first place? Why does Ramsay even return without looking for Stannis? Assuming he actually lost an unexpected high amount of his original army, could it be that he doesn't want to risk looking for Stannis? I guess you could say that Brienne and Pod can save them, but how can two more individuals hope to stand a chance, unless the Boltons have suffered extremely severe losses?

I've read speculations about how Brienne might have not killed Stannis when he told her ""do your duty,"" but that's only one piece of the hypothetical puzzle. What do you guys think of my ideas?

UPDATE: seems /u/TheOneTrueThade managed to figure out the blanks. Big thanks.

We are ten White Walkers  
We are them, all dead  
Then come old man winter  
He'll rip us all to sherds

Hide away your children  
Then hide away your self  
Dig deep into mountain  
Dig far beyond the spell  

They come down  
They come down the wall x2

You can hear their footsteps  
Crunch the fresh-felt snow  
You can hear them feasting  
Oh, tell me where's my crow  

(I breed them in armory?)  
Sharpening their blades  
I pray for every one of them  
And sacrifices made

They come down  
They come down the wall x2

(bitching solo)

So beware you king and commoners  
Be ready young and old  
Never mind the game inside the realm  
For it's no match for winter's cold

They come down  
They come down the wall  
To save us all   
To save us all

Hope anyone else got more insight on this. I just love Mastodon, and GoT, so this song got a special place in my heart...",10,44,False,self,,,,,

This is yet another ""Stannis could still have a chance"" thread, but hear me out.

1. We see that the Boltons ""massacre"" Stannis' depleted army, but one of the things that stuck out while watching the episode for the first time was that Stannis managed to successfully make his way back to the forest, with only two Bolton soldiers trailing him (shouldn't there be a lot more?). Also, no Bolton soldier appears to be remotely near Brienne. When we see Ramsay, there was only (IIRC) one guard next to him as he finishes off a Baratheon straggler. It seemed to me that the Bolton army was actually almost annihilated as well. Why aren't there more Bolton troops near Ramsay? If they were off searching for Stannis, why isn't there a hint of them? Could Stannis' army have successfully inflicted enough losses for the Boltons to have suffered a pyrrhic victory? A pyrrhic victory that leaves them extremely vulnerable to the rest of the North and/or Littlefinger?

2. I thought we would get caught up with Littlefinger. Is it possible that he's already in the North (cue teleporter jokes)? When I saw the Bolton army, my thought at first glance was that they were actually the Knights of the Vale, given the high number of calvalry. I mean, aside from the deserted sellsword army theory, why else would the Boltons have so many fresh horses?

3. If Ramsay and his men returned to Winterfell moments before Theon and Sansa manage to escape, how are we to believe that Theon and Sansa are going to successfully escape in the first place? Why does Ramsay even return without looking for Stannis? Assuming he actually lost an unexpected high amount of his original army, could it be that he doesn't want to risk looking for Stannis? I guess you could say that Brienne and Pod can save them, but how can two more individuals hope to stand a chance, unless the Boltons have suffered extremely severe losses?

I've read speculations about how Brienne might have not killed Stannis when he told her ""do your duty,"" but I think people have overlooked these other details as well. I suppose contrived writing could explain these things as well, but I'm putting them out there because most of the stuff I read about this part of the episode involves Brienne's one-on-one with Stannis, but I think they might be more to it than that.",29,29,False,self,,,,,

While this is a cause that many of the /r/gameofthrones moderators feel very strongly about, it is ultimately an issue that exists between the moderators and the administrators and does not necessarily need to impact uninvolved users.  While we share many of the same frustrations that other large subreddits have regarding lack of communication and systematic disregard of moderators, this subreddit is, and has always been, a drama-free community that focuses solely on the discussion of Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire.  Our first priority as moderators is to provide a platform for this community to share and discuss the stories and characters that they enjoy, and that purpose would not be served by shutting down the subreddit.

We sincerely appreciate the support for our moderator team that many of you have expressed in modmail and in the previous Mod Raven regarding this topic, but we feel that our moral support for our fellow moderators and own personal concerns regarding the actions and motives of Reddit executives and administrators do not overwrite our own [subreddit values](/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy) regarding [Relevancy](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy#wiki_1._relevancy.3A_all_content_must_be_relevant_to_the_asoiaf_universe) and [Maturity](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy#wiki_4._maturity.3A_content_must_be_respectful_and_mature).

This does not mean that the moderators of /r/gameofthrones support or are satisfied with the present state of affairs.  Reddit, as an organization, has prioritized gimmicks (redditmade, snoovitars, redditnotes, etc) above creating better moderation tools, opening up lines of communication, etc, and this has not been to the advantage of the community as a whole.

While the administrators have taken the first step towards improving moderator-administrator communication in the wake of this protest, the grievances that have been publically aired as a result will be a long time in addressing.  Many moderators are wary of the assurances being made by the administrators due to a long track record of broken promises, and so the trust that was ultimately broken yesterday will take a long time to repair.

Again, we thank you all for your support during this time.  If you would like to join the protest and show your support for the moderators, we encourage you to [send a message to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&amp;amp;subject=&amp;amp;message=) at /r/reddit.com.  Any further posts about this matter to /r/gameofthrones will be removed.

If we look at the track record of GRRM's writing so far, we see that he challenges, and ultimately destroys, most of the fundamentals of traditional fantasy. Main characters die in unexpected and unhonourable ways. Bad people turn good, good people turn bad, and there's no inherently evil or inherently good characters. He's redefining the genre and making it uncharacteristically unpredictable. Why, then, would he allow fans to use prophecies to predict the end of his books (Azor Ahai etc.) as well as the main character development twists (R+L=J)? We all know GRRM is leading us on, and I'm willing to bet he's gonna leave us heartbroken with his prophecies just like he does with absolutely everything else.

585,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-7-4,2015,7,4,13,3c2maq,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS][THEORY] Why the White Walkers were able to come back after thousands of years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3c2maq/all_spoilerstheory_why_the_white_walkers_were/,notbobby125,1435984378,"Thousand of years ago, in the age when the Giants and the Children of the Forest freely walked around, Winter came, and the White Walkers nearly killed every living thing in Westeros. However, the alliance of the Children and men pushed the Walkers back, killed most of the Walkers, and erected a Wall of Ice just in case the Walker's ever came back. It has been uncounted Winters since that time, but only now have the Walkers come back. Why? Why is it this long winter the one that is bringing the dead with it?

Craster. It's only because of the deal he made that we are again going to have a War for the Dawn.

We can assume that not every White Walker was killed in the war, but the vast majority of them died. Why build the wall unless you know someone will want to go past it? However, the few that survived were unable to construct another army. They could raise the dead as wights, but that actually requires killing things first. Either the White Walkers would have to go kill things themselves, or scavenge dead bodies. Killing things themselves is risky, as any wildling could be holding a blade of Dragonstone (particularly a few hundred years after the war) or run away. Even a White Walker is not going to be in a very good condition if it is stepped on by a Giant. Scavenging bodies will mean they can only raise whatever predators left behind. Even if they raised a Wight, their is no garentee the Wight could kill anything before it is either A. chopped to pieces or B. decays and falls apart from age. They are not very dangerous as individuals, using near zombie like tactics. Only in large numbers does their extreme durability actually make up for their stupidity.

It is also possible there is a limit too how many Wights a White Walker can actually control before they run out of whatever magic fuels the Wights spell, so they cannot have an army without ~~constructing additional Pylons~~ having enough White Walkers to control it.

While the exact mechanisms for transforming a person into a White Walker are not known, from what we have seen, they can't just do it on a whim, like they can with the Wights. It seems to require a living being taken all the way too their Ice Castle for some kind of spell to be placed upon the person. Dragging an unwilling person hundreds of miles is not the easiest of tasks, even if their wasn't the risk of them freezing to death on the way there.

So, the White Walkers waited, for time was the only thing they had. A few decades before the show/books, a White Walker came across Craster's Cabin, finding only young man, with a baby son and a daughter. Craster in a cowardly move, begged and held out his son willingly to the Walker. The White Walker took it, bringing it North, and turning the baby into the first new White Walker in thousands of years. A few years later, it came back again, hoping to pray on Craster's cowardliness. Craster again yielded his baby son, making the unspoken bargain.

Year after year, the numbers of White Walkers expanded, with the male children of Craster filling their ranks. That is why all the White Walkers we have seen are male. At some point, the White Walkers hit a critical mass. They had enough to kill Wildinglings, to make more Wights then they were losing to decay and the elements. They could actually build and maintain an army. The Children of the forest were all but gone, even the ancient Giants have seem to forgotten the White Walker's weakness too dragon glass. They saw how the weather was changing, that the Long Summer was coming to an end, and a Long Winter was ahead. 

Only now, did they have the numbers to freely march around with an army, only now could the White Walkers prove too the Southerners that they are not a myth, only now did they have enough to march against the wall.

And it's all thanks to Craster, the coward that was unwilling even to just run.",68,154,False,self,,,,,

Firstly I hope he wins for the sake of mountain clans, but knowing GRRM I'm leaning more towards a defeat.. or a Pyrrhic victory at best. and the show has only reassured me of this.
 
so at this point we know what Stannis is planning. Setting a trap in the lake and surprising whoever comes through. But remember stannis doesn't know he has allies in Winterfell. Boltons will always send Manderlys and Umbers first. which makes it possible that they are the ones who will be trapped by Stannis. so basically his surprise will be wasted on his allies while  Boltons either dig in and sit inside the castle or see the slaughter in front of them and avoid defeat.

Here's what I don't get and maybe it's explained.

Every time it's Jaime's turn to guard outside Robert's bed chamber, Robert makes sure to be banging a ton of girls and be really loud about it, because it humiliates Cersei and pisses Jaime off.

Why does Robert want to piss Jaime off? Why doesn't Robert like Jaime?


Robert hates Targaryans. Jaime killed the Targaryan king. Shouldn't Robert love Jaime and be his good bro? Both were badass warriors so they should have that to talk about and both have similar taste in women. In theory they should be buddies.

Does Robert know the rumors that Jaime is banging Cersei or no? Why does Robert make it a point to constantly piss off Jaime Lannister, his kings guard, supposedly one of the top sword fighters in the land, and man who murdered Roberts hated enemy?",78,75,False,self,,,,,

I thought a lot about Jon and L+R=J, which is by far the only theory I'm sure it's true simply cause there's just proof all over the books and show.  
However, one thing bugs me a lot. A whole lot.  
  
You see, George has some kind of a signature look for every house. I'm pretty sure these 'rules' apply to everyone, of course, there could always be an exception.  
So, Starks have brown hair and blue (almost gray, icy) eyes, Targaryans have white hair and purple (blue/green in the show) eyes, Lannisters are blonde with blue eyes and Baratheons are black-haired and brown-eyed.   
Then how come Jon Snow's skin is a bit darker and his hair and eyes too? If nothing he should be 'lighter' than all of them, right?  
  
*Jon has a lean build, with dark hair and grey eyes so dark they border on black.*  
  
Yes, this resembles house Stark a little, but when I checked their descriptions and looked at the characters again, he seemed more like a Sand to me than a Snow.
  
And then it hit me.  
It could actually be possible that Jon Snow is a son of Elia Martell and Rhaegar Targaryen - Aegon Targaryen. He could have been smuggled away from Kings Landing through Ned Stark.  
I haven't come up with any reasons as to why would that happen that way, or why 'Promise me Ned' in that case, but somehow it would make sense to me if L+R=J didn't have as much proof.  
Of course, this is just a speculation, I have no 'proof' except for my view on the character's physical appearance, and the fact is that it would fit the timeline perfectly.  

So, any opinions on this matter?  ",29,18,False,self,,,,,

We often see different people posting individual memes or videos about them, but would be good to have a discussion of them as a whole. 

I'll start off with one of GRRMS greatest bit of writing, top 5 passages from literature imo, DAE? This is just perfect and with any hope we will see the speaker next season after a certain casting call... (Cleganebowl confirmed?). Let's hope he can live up to this scene without D and D butchering it. *D&amp;D runs around looking for an old man disguise for Alfie Allen *


""Ser? My lady?"" said Podrick. ""Is a broken man an outlaw?""

""More or less,"" Brienne answered.

Septon Maribald disagreed. ""More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sand piper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, sourced by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house they were born until the day some lord came around to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with stripes of hide. Brothers march with brothers, fathers with sons, friends with friends. They've heard the songs and stories, and go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the glory and wealth they will win. War seems a fine adventure, greater than the most of them will ever know.

""Then they get a taste of battle.

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others may go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break on his hundred and first. Brothers watch brothers die, fathers lose their sons, and friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after being gutted by an axe.

""They see the lord that led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when it is still half healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron half helm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world...

And the man breaks.

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. the broken man lives from day to day, meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them... but he should pity them as well.""",60,69,False,self,,,,,

802,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-7-6,2015,7,6,3,3c7v9s,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS][THEORY] Azor Hot Pie,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3c7v9s/all_spoilerstheory_azor_hot_pie/,freezingman66,1436122004,"Hi guys, my names Phil. Many of you are fully convinced of either Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen being Azor Ahai. Some of you believe in Ajorah Ahai, which, I admit, for a while, caught my Azor Ah-eye. However, I believe Ive found some evidence that backs an alternate theory, and through careful reading of the source material, rewatching the show, and/or watching of YouTube compilations set to Metallica music, I am ready to unveil it.

Azor Ahai- the legendary prophetic hero destined to fight the Others and fight back The Long Night. The Others, of course, are White Walkers, those fiends whose hatred for every creature with *hot blood* in its veins (Old Nan, AGOT) was legendary. Kings Blood? No, *hot* blood. Hot Pie blood.

Thats goofy. A joke, not real evidence. But nothing can be discounted when it comes to GRRM. Anyway, lets get started. Its prophecy time.

**Azor Ahai was born amidst salt and smoke**. Its hardly a stretch to assume that Hot Pie was born in a bakery, full of salt and smoke. This is the easy one- we know he was born in Fleabottom (S4E7 Mockingbird).

&gt; Im from there myself, originally. Fleabottom, born and bre~~a~~d.

Not a tough jump to make. This is easy. Moving on.

**Azor Ahai was born beneath a bleeding star**. Sounds an awful lot like a red berry pie shaped like a star. Perhaps, you might be thinking, this is why his name is Hot Pie. Perhaps thats what youre thinking. Easy. Lets get to the tough stuff.

**But wait, Phil. What about the Dragonsblood? Hot Pie doesnt have Dragonsblood, Phil.** Youre right. Hot Pie doesnt have Dragonsblood or does he? Hot Pie, S3E3, Walk of Punishment, as Arya and Gendry leave Hot Pie, Hot Pie says to Arya:

&gt; My brother aint no king. Im not [sic] Stark of Winterhell [sic].

Hot Pie knows that his brother isnt a king. But is it reading too much into his words to say his dad was? His father was Aegon Targaryen? You decide. Prophecy is notoriously hard to read. More on Targaryen blood soon.

**What about Nissa Nissa? What about Lightbringer?** The story of Azor Ahai plunging Lightbringer through his wife (the worst thing he could have had to do) in order to forge it? Well, how about this quote, again from S3E3, Walk of Punishment, again as Arya and Gendry are leaving, Hot Pie says to Arya and Gendry:

&gt; Dont get stabbed.

Hot Pies #1 wish is for them to not get stabbed. Is this an implication that Azor Hot Pie will need to forge his breadsword, Lightbringer, by plunging it through their hearts? The worst thing he could have had to do? But wait, theres more. After he says these fateful, prophetic words to Arya and Gendry, Gendry responds:

&gt; You dont burn your fingers.

This all but confirms Hot Pies Targaryen blood. ~~Hot Pies fingers cannot be burned~~ [(good point Ghostise)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3c7v9s/all_spoilerstheory_azor_hot_pie/cst825b?context=3) When taking under consideration the fact that Hot Pie *will* be stabbing Arya through the heart to forge a *flaming sword*, Gendry, with his knowledge of blacksmithing, recognizes that Hot Pie has to watch his fingers (because of the fire). He has to watch his fingers because he is Azor Ahai. Azor Hot Pie.

**Phil, Azor Ahai is known for being associated with dragons.** And Melisandre believes that Azor Ahai will awaken stone dragons, but her prophecies are often only close to the truth. And Hot Pie has no dragons at all. But, what gift does Hot Pie give Arya? He gives her a wolf made of bread in S3E3- it is shoddy, and Arya practically laughs at it. Over time, he bakes a second wolf, which much better resembles a wolf, and gives it to Brienne to give to Arya (S4E7); it is exponentially better than the first loaf of bread. With this exponential improvement with each loaf of bread, is it really so absurd to believe he could bake a bread dragon (almost a stone dragon you dont want to be too literal- GRRM), then a second, then a third, and by the fourth or fifth, have a dragon that rivals Balerion, The Black Dread? I think not. It is not outlandish. GRRM.

**Finally, some strawpeople come up to me and say Phil, Hot Pie is not a hero.** He isnt Azor Ahai. Hot Pie would just give up. Well, do I have a quote for you. S4E7 Mockingbird:

&gt; See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie.

Is it so much of a stretch to assume the gravy means the people of Westeros? That without the gravy of the people of Westeros,  there is no pie A.K.A. Hot Pie A.K.A. Azor Ahai A.K.A. Azor Hot Pie? Im pretty sure Ive heard GRRM slip up and refer to the people of Westeros as the gravy before. Someone help me out with a source on that one.

Anyways, if anyone finds any flaws in my theory, please feel free to comment- Ive tested it pretty soundly, though, so Id be surprised.",92,732,False,self,,,,,

""A long time ago, they say, some old, Southern King enslaved our Giants by magic, and forced them to build your famous wall. He then kicked all our kind to the other side and raised an army too keep us there.""

From the ancient stories (so old and so hard to confirm many in Westeros consider it a myth) we know Brann the Builder made the Wall too make sure the White Walkers couldn't ever come back. There were no split between the Wildlings and the rest of Westeros, they were all the First Men (plus the Children of the Forest and the giants). I doubt there was anyone still living north of the area that Brann would build the Wall, for they would of been slaughtered by the Walkers or fled south. There doesn't appear to be a logical reason for Brann to of just thrown his own people into the North. If the White Walkers did come back, that would just mean they had easier access too corpses to make a bigger army. Yet Brann sent people, who believed in the same nameless gods, to live in a perpetually frozen tundra, and set the Night's Watch too keep them there.

Why? Why doom a thousand generations to such a cold existence. Why also send the Giants? If they were enslaved to his will, that would mean Bann controlled the literally largest army in the world.

I believe, the Wildlings are some kind of sacrifice. 

It is said Brann used magic to construct the wall. People today would struggle to make a structure of that size and length with modern machines and concrete. Making it out of Ice would be simply impossible, as Ice isn't strong enough to support a wall of that size, let alone for thousands of years (or however long it has actually been since the time of the First Men, Sam notes the various anachronisms that make the accuracy of various stories questionable).

Time and time again, we seen magic in the universe can only be achieved for a price. To kill a King you need the blood of a King. If you take a mask away from the faceless God you lose your sight. To make a blizzard let up, to birth dragons, to forge a sword that can kill the undead, requires you too kill another.

How much magic do you think it took Brann to craft a Wall of pure ice that stretches from one side of a continent to another in just his life time? The Lord of Light demands a price for his powers, who is too say the Old Gods are any different?

My theory is, the Wildlings were that price. Brann could have his wall, but ONLY if there are people on the Northern side, to live in their nature, to bow too their bleeding trees. The Giants, the Children of the Forest, and even some of his own first men, would forever be under their stars, forever be their worshipers.

So, on the very last day of the Wall's construction, all the Giants and a lot of the First Men were North of the wall, expecting the various gates that line the wall to rise up and let them through. The gates never opened. Those that tried to open the gate by force were met by thousands of arrows from the First Night Watch. They fled away from the Wall, separated from their warm food and their warm beds, as tribute too the Gods that allowed such a feat too be built.",16,14,False,self,,,,,

I think a lot of people will likely nominate either S2:E9 ""Blackwater"" or S3:E9 ""The Rains of Castamere"" or S5:E8 ""Hardhome"" all for their stellar climatic scenes and dialogue.

A Personal favorite of mine is S3:E5 ""Kissed by Fire"" for its small moments, its an episode basically dedicated to characters talking to other characters (Jamie and Brienne, Jorah and Selmy, Jon and Ygritte, Robb and his generals etc) topped off by a duel between Berric and the Hound, I find the episode simple and enjoyable.

##1.01 - ""Winter is Coming""

* Directed By: Tim Van Patten
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 17, 2011

Robert Baratheon, King of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and his wife, Cersei Lannister, travel north to make his old friend Eddard ""Ned"" Stark  Warden of the North and Lord of the castle Winterfell  an offer he cannot refuse. Across the narrow sea in Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen forges a new alliance to regain the Iron Throne; he will trade his sister Daenerys in marriage to the savage Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in exchange for Drogo's army. Back in Winterfell, Ned's 10-year-old son Brandon discovers that Queen Cersei and her brother Jaime are involved in an incestuous relationship, a discovery for which he pays dearly.

---

##1.02 - ""The Kingsroad""

* Directed By: Tim Van Patten
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 24, 2011

Brandon lies unconscious, his fate in doubt, while Catelyn tells her family that she believes his fall was an attempt on his life by the Lannisters. Having accepted his new role as the King's Hand (the King's closest confidant and prime minister), Ned leaves his home in Winterfell with his daughters Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn stays behind to tend to Brandon. Jon Snow, Ned's bastard son, heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, protectors of the Wall that keeps the vicious White Walkers and the savage wildlings from entering civilized Westeros. Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf and the Queen's brother, decides to forego the trip south with his family, instead joining Jon's entourage heading to the Wall. Viserys bides his time in hopes of winning back the throne, while Daenerys focuses her attention on learning how to please her new husband, Drogo. When Prince Joffrey Baratheon threatens Arya Stark and her friend, one of her family's dire wolves defends her, provoking a conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters. Brandon awakens from unconsciousness.

I don't know if I'm the only one feeling genuinely mad about this, but I was particularly saddened when there was no apparent purpose for the show to have Stannis burn Shireen? As he dies in Mother's Mercy, what exactly was accomplished except making Stannis look bad in the picture? The guy has been D&amp;Ds black sheep for 5 seasons and as a last ""Fuck you"" they have him burn Shireen, only to die an episode later? What was the purpose of this? He could've died a hero,  instead they had him murder his child and have Brienne kill him. Did they want Brienne to look good so they had to make Stannis look evil in his dying moments?

Even if the snow cleared, burning Shireen just seemed so pointless and gratuitous now looking back. 


This has been a case with Dorne too, all this to rescue Myrcella and in the end she dies leaving Dorne. All these silly scenes with the Snakes, Jaime and Bronn killing and fighting was for what exactly? We had tons of time dedicated to this pointless wattered down story for them to rush every plot and death in Mother's Mercy? What the hell was that episode?? I can't even digest it properly, so much was going on, I don't even know if I should be caring. They killed off two major characters in like 5 minutes total.

At first I didn't fully comprehend it. I would come here and see everyone throwing a shitfit about the Sand Snakes, bitching about which character wasn't done justice, yelling about book vs. show. I wasn't too worried though because I was willing to give D&amp;D the benefit of the doubt. However, now that I'm re-watching the series, something in particular jumps out to me. More than just a story problem, this season lacks any care and devotion put towards immersing the viewer in the world of Thrones. I never felt like these characters were interacting in/with their environment so much as the environment was just a backdrop for the characters. It's not really something you can put your finger on, I just feel like this season was kind of going through the motions and taking for granted all the little details that make this world worth caring about, like they were forcing the direction of the characters without much grace or finesse. I mean it doesn't help that Mereen was appallingly boring and Stannis took so damn long to get to Winterfell, but I would have gladly put up with it if they had personalized these settings a little more. I can't recall a single scene in this season as memorable as Tywin's introduction scene in Season 1 (where he skins an animal). Details like that are not essential to the plot but are essential to the overall experience. All I remember about this season is Ramsay looks good with his shirt off and at one point a bunch of peasants hissed at Dany (I think).


Anyway, I would be interested to hear if anyone else had similar thoughts. I think the last three episodes were good (especially end of Hardhome) but overall this season seems kind of like a slump, like they think they know what they're doing and are getting cocky. Hopefully it will get better.",12,11,False,self,,,,,

Knowing this, and looking to happen onto more insight, the first thing that struck out to me is that the very first POV story (after the prologue beyond the wall) is from Bran's perspective.  

Knowing already that Bran's destiny is probably to become the three-eyed crow, this makes me wonder what role the three eyed crow actually has in GRRM's universe.  

Aside from Bran, we haven't really seen much three-eyed crow influence on the rest of the universe.  What *is* the purpose of the three-eyed crow?  Is it just to put knowledge where it belongs?  If so, has Brynden Rivers just been doing a terrible job of it?  ",3,14,False,self,,,,,

And so here I am during the GoT off-season, and I might as well share my absolute *craziest* theory with you since we all have nothing much else to do.

DISCLAIMER: Keep in mind I myself don't even believe this theory, although at one time I sort of did.  There's a lot of evidence for it, especially in the books, but a lot less evidence since the show aired.  That said, it's so balls to the wall hardcore I needed to get it off my chest.  Ready?  Good, because here goes:

**Ned Stark is ALIVE**

Yeah, yeah, go ahead, throw the tomatoes.  But before you wind back, hear me out.

The origins of this theory come from me reading the books.  Season one had just started, and the show was so incredible I was compelled to binge-read the entire ASOFAI series in just a few weeks.  Awesome doesn't even begin to describe it.  But most of you know that already.

Anyway, there's a lot of really weird stuff in **in the books** when it comes to Ned Stark's death.  And later on in the story, what with all the sorcery and deception and resurrection, it seems almost like GRRM was angling for what might be the most insanely hidden comeback of any character in any story since the dawn of storytelling.

On screen, we watch Ned die.  The shot cuts immediately away as he's beheaded, but it left little doubt as to what we saw.

In the book however, Ned's death was VERY obscure.  First of all, each chapter of the book is written in the first person.  Each deals with an individual character, and the title of the chapter is that character's name.  After Ned's last talk with Varys, in the black cells, we never saw any first-person story perspective from him.  So in the book, we never saw Ned die from his own point of view.  We never got to know what he was thinking, or any of that stuff, which was a pretty shitty sendoff for such an important and major character.

Anyone reading the book will know what I'm talking about here.

In the book, Ned's death is seen during Arya's chapter.  And in that chapter, Yoren grabs Arya (like he does in the series) and says ""Don't look!  Don't look!"".  So essentially, we never SEE Ned die.  Not in the book.

Adding to the mystery were the many times Arya's swordmaster Syrio taught her the phrase ""HEAR with your ears!  SEE with your eyes!""  This was drilled into us several times during the book.  And in the book, as Arya is listening to Ned confess treason, it explains that *""It didn't sound like her father's voice at all.  The voice was low and far away...""*

When Arya watched her father kneel before Joffrey, the book says something else:  *""It didn't look like her father at all.  The man kneeling before the king was thin, wasted, and not like Eddard Stark at all""*

Hmmmm...

Not long afterward, Joffrey brings Sansa up to the battlements to see her father's head on a pike.  That chapter describes things even more obscurely, because Sansa - unable to look away - sees her father's head and the book says *""It didn't look like her father at all.  Even covered in tar to preserve it, it looked wholly different than the man she remembered as her father"".*

At this point, from my books-only point of view, I began wondering if Varys didn't somehow save Ned.  Switch him out for someone else during that secret meeting.  It was almost like GRRM was going out of his way to hint that Ned wasn't really dead, and that maybe, just maybe, some other poor 'thin, wasted' soul was face-swapped or whatever.  I think about Varys, and how many steps ahead of everyone he usually is.  He could've easily anticipated Joffery would try to behead Ned Stark right then and there, regardless of whether he 'confessed' or not.

Then I remembered Varys was part of a troup of actors, which would certainly give him a knowledge of makeup.  He was the slave of a sorcerer, which would at least minimally acquaint him with magic.

Back to Ned.  Later in the 2nd book his bones arrive back in the north.  And as Catelyn examines them, the book says something else fairly interesting: *""They didn't seem like her lord's bones - they seemed smaller and more frail""*  This is the THIRD reference to how small this executed person was, or how it didn't seem like Ned at all.

Finally, another tantalizing piece of the puzzle comes when we watch ""Mance Rayder"" getting executed by Stannis.  I put Mance in quotes here, because in the book, the man who burned (and got shot by Jon) wasn't Mance at all.  It was actually Rattleshirt, who was magically glamored by Melisandre to *look like* Mance.  The show completely omits this storyline, but in the books a man is burned before hundreds of Night's Watch, Wildings. and Stannis's own men... a man who looks EXACTLY like Mance in every way possible, so much so that no one even questions it.  Yet it was a man who was really someone else (not to mention how much this scene mirrors Ned's own execution before the crowds of King's Landing).

And speaking of someone else, now's as good a time as any to bring up the Faceless Men.  You know, the ones who can *put anyone's face on someone else* and make that person look entirely different.  Oh, except for the build.  Even a ""thin, wasted"" guy with Ned Stark's face might seem off; maybe not to a cheering throng of blood-crazed citizens, but definitely to Ned's own daughters and family.

Soooooooooooooooo... all of this led me to believe Ned wasn't *really* dead, at least until I watched the show.  Yet was that possible?  If he wasn't dead, where would he be?  Would Varys risk spiriting him away, like he's done with so many other characters before?  And knowing Ned Stark, would he *really* just stay hidden all this time?  Sit and do nothing, with his entire family - and the realm - in danger?

*There must always be a Stark in Winterfell*

Again, it's a nutty theory.  One I'm not sure I ever truly believed.  It fell apart quickly as the show progressed, and the books kept coming, and Ned still hadn't shown up yet.  But for a while at least, it was fun to follow the clues.  And even more fun to think of Ned showing up out of completely fucking nowhere, and then kicking unholy amounts of ass.

Shae: *Whose sword is this?*

Tyrion:  *It's Valyrian Steel, baby.*

Dramatic, exciting, awe inspiring, much wow but not so fast...how does she intend to do this?

 I feel like it's the equivalent of someone today with no political knowledge or experience in the government, who has failed miserably at being a mayor of a small town thinking ""You know what, democracy sucks, I'm going to march to DC, burn it down and make something better."" Not the best metaphor but you get the idea-pretty silly

Everyone wants to see her on the iron throne, but if she does somehow win it, won't it just be the wheel all over again? A Dragon taking it from a Baratheon(Mostly Lion). And if she does change the game, where will she get advisors since even Tyrion only has experience in playing the current game Westeros politics. 

[Tinfoil Dany theory](#g "")Maybe she will just burn down the current structure and create independent states?"") Well each kingdom already has its own Warden so I feel if she leaves it at that then history will just repeat itself and  the noble families from each kingdom will wrestle for power or some rando will rise and  try to pull an Aegon the Conqueror.

If you take into account the White Walkers,[White walker theory](#g ""she may show up in time to save Westeros from them with her fire"")  but if she succeeds it just places her in the same position of deciding how to break the wheel afterwards.

IMO from her [S5](#s ""current fiasco in Mereen"") she just sounds like all talk to me.

With that said, I hope you enjoy.

I believe Martin is deliberately holding information back from us, secrets that we cannot begin to fathom or speculate on. Firstly, why I think he's done this was in response to criticism over why Eddard never revealed Jon Snow's parentage even though we had 15 chapters inside his head. Honestly, he should have let slip Jon Snow's mother. 

So between A Storm of Swords and A Feast for Crows, Martin looked to rectify this error by implementing the pseudonym Chapter Titles. For example, ""The King's Prize"" for Asha, ""The Spurned Suitor"" for Quentyn and so on.

I stumbled onto this theory when reading the ""Cat of the Canals"" when Cat goes to the brothels and Dareon is there, alive. Later when asked for three new things she learned that day. Cat tells the Kindly man that Dareon is dead. The black singer who was sleeping at the Happy Port. He was really a deserter from the Nights Watch. Someone slit his throat and pushed him into a canal, but they kept his boots. and confirms that ""Arya of House Stark"" killed him. At the time, I thought to myself, why didn't we get to see her kill him. Personally, I would have enjoyed that and was disappointed that it had been left out. 

But then it got me thinking, why was it left out? Then I remembered that this was not an Arya chapter, but a ""Cat of the Canals"" chapter and this is how George R. R. Martin has been trolling us all since AFFC, making us dance to the whim of his pseudonym Chapter Titles. By using this technique, he can forgo information that I believe should realistically have been brought up by our POV characters, as it will be vitally important later on in the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series. For example, why do we only get one Victarion chapter and have the rest titled as ""The Iron Captain"" ""The Reaver"" ""The Iron Suitor"". And why did Asha (Greyjoy), Areo (Hotah) Arys (Oakheart) Aeron (Greyjoy) Barristan (Selmy) Quentyn (Martel) and Jon (Connington) have no chapters titles that simply displayed their name? Unlike Cersei, Brienne who were both also introduced in a Feast for Crows and Davos, Jaime and Samwell from a Storm of Swords. Why did we get no ""The One-hand Kingsguard"" ""The Queen Regent"" ""The Onion Knight"" and so on.

What makes the group of pseudonym chapter title characters so special? What separates them from everyone else? I believe the reason is this, they are all hiding a secret. Nothing too extreme, but something that should have been mentioned. For example the 3 Greyjoy's could be hiding...

THE GREYJOY NORTHERN CONSPIRACY or THE TRUTH BEHIND EURON, however, more realistically the truth or secret is probable not even that big, but will be very significant over the course of the next two novels - I have no idea what these secrets could be, but if they did exist and Martin did not want any of the Greyjoy characters to reveal them. He might have their chapters preoccupied with other stuff, like being ""The Sacrifice"" or ""The Prophet"" to not bring up the crucial secret of Euron's past. 

The pseudonym Chapter Titles are a justification, I think. So when we ask GRRM at the end, okay why didn't Asha, Victarion or Aeron not bring up the time when Euron changed his face or  when Balon said something about the Long Night. The Troll King can simply explain, that is something Asha, Victarion and Aeron would bring up. Not ""The King's Prize"" ""The Iron Suitor"" or ""The Prophet"".

Same goes for the Dorne characters, I reckon Doran has spilled out some secret to Quentyn in Aero's hearing. Something that will come back into fruition later, which is why they are the ""The Captain of the Guard"" and ""The Dragontamer"" as to keep this secret hidden. And Arianne also knows something she hasn't told us yet with her chapter titles ""The Queenmaker"" and ""The Princess In The Tower""

Same with Aegon, I reckon there are going to be some amazing secrets going on with the new Targaryen, but did Jon Connington give us anything that might spoil the surprise....no, he did not, because he was ""The Lost Lord"" and ""The Griffin Reborn"" not Jon. Or Martin simply didn't want to confuse us with two Jon's, which is understandable.

But I think even Alayne and Reek or The Prince of Winterfell are hiding some secret activities, like maybe as the Ghost of Winterfell - Theon did some nefarious activities, but whatever it could be - I do not know, but if George was going to hide these Dornish, Greyjoy, Arya, Sansa, Theon secrets.

Rant post.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3cchp5/all_spoilers_theory_did_anyone_else_find_season_5/,HerrSprink,1436216417,"So I started watching GoT about a year ago and in a matter of three or so months, I finished the first four seasons. I was so excited to watch the fifth season on live tv with my friends and even though I had to wait a week in between each story, I was happy to do so because I finally had people to talk about the show with. I watched the first seven episodes with my friends and continued onward on my own after that.

After finishing the finale last night and having had the time to ruminate on the entire season, I feel as if the season altogether was just sort of a let down. I understand that this particular season was a bit different in a couple of ways; it was the last season to feature adapted plot lines from the officially released books and therefore it followed events that were preordained and also that its significance in the overall narrative is to establish and foreshadow events and plotlines that will unfold towards the end of the show's lifetime.

However, with that being said, I can't get over this sense of disappointment that I have with this season. It started slowly, much as any season of this show does, but unlike other seasons in which the ball gets rolling around the fourth episode or so, the fifth sort of just wallowed around until the sixth episode with Sansa's appalling rape and even then, that was at the end of the episode. Hardhome felt like the first really significant event of the season but in alot of ways, it just felt like it came to late to matter. Additionally, a lot of the individual story threads felt incredibly anti-climactic; Arya kills Meryn Trant but immediately goes blind after doing literally nothing else the entire season, Margaery is still in prison but Cersei goes free from her agonizing but brief walk, Stannis's assault on Winterfell seemingly ended in less than half a day, and Prince Oberyn's paramour gets her revenge in her last scene of the season.

I specifically haven't mentioned Jon Snow simply because it's no surprise that he'll be coming back; George RR Martin has hinted at it, people speculate that Melissandre will resurrect him, and Kit Harrington has kept his hair long just like his contract demands. I feel that this plot line, which is really the only one I care about at this point, was made oddly feeble by killing Jon Snow so late in the game, just because the wait for Jon Snow's inevitable resurrection will be incredibly short.

Like I said, I understand that this season was important in the context of the overall narrative but it just came off as so disappointing and anti-climactic that I couldn't help but share my thoughts.

I think that this is indicative of who they are and also foreshadows what they will do in the story. I will go through each of them: 

 **Rickon Stark - Shaggeydog**: Rickon is the youngest and therefore has spent the least amount of time being raised by Starks, leaving him wild and unruly (in the book anyway). It seems to me that he is more wildling than not, and his departure for Skagos with a wildling solidifies this. 

**Brandon Stark - Summer**: An interesting name for a wolf considering he is essentially the old gods now. He opposes the white walkers which could symbolize winter which would be offset by summer. 

 **Arya Stark - Nymeria**: To explain this one I have to breifly describe some GOT lore about Nymeria the warrior queen. Nymeria once lived in Essos and immagrated to Westeros (specifically Dorne) and own the respect of the people there by conquering a divided Dorne. SO. Arya left Westeros to go to Essos, where she gained the respect of the Faceless Men by killing people, meanwhile her wolf is going on a murderous rampage in central Westeros with a gargantuan pack of wolves devastating the countryside. Sounds kinda similar, does it not? 

**Sansa Stark - Lady**: So Sansa is the most politically savvy Stark, who's identity was broken from the very beginning of the story. Her wolf Lady was killed through some political bull-crap near the beginning of the first book/season. Not really foreshadowing, but it makes you think what else this could symbolize, maybe something like her willingness to leave her Stark traditions behind for a more political game. 

**Rob Stark - Grey Wind**: The only speculation I have here is that Rob was a decisive military leader who won the battles he fought swiftly and then died out without a real fight. Grey Wind was noted as fast even for a dire wolf, who was much the same way as Rob: deadly, swift, and killed unceremoniously without a real fight. 

**John Snow - Ghost**: So John was always the ""runt"" of the litter, always the black sheep of the family (white fur), and is absolutely deadly. My speculation for what the name ""Ghost"" specifically means is kinda funky. [Theory]( #g ""When John is murdered by his Night's Watch brothers I believe that he warged into Ghost, making John a ghost (from a certain point of view). It is a bit of a stretch, but as far as I know it hasn't been speculated before.""]

Note that I wish I had more time to be descriptive, but am pretty busy, and struggle with typing/format on a mobile device.  Thanks and I'd love to hear some criticism/feedback.  Here goes nothing.

Sansa Stark: Sansa's wolf was killed off for a crime Arya's committed.  This shows how Sansa will be punished for crimes she did not commit.  An innocent girl pushed around and punished throughout her entire teen life, all because of her father, and cruelty towards those involved with him.

Arya Stark: In the second episode of Season 1, Arya pushes her wolf away, to protect it. The wolf is an important part of her, and loves it.  This is foreshadowing how she is forced to push away her identity to become ""no one"" in Jaqin's training.  

Rickon Stark: Who?... Lol, but honestly he hasn't had a very significant role in the story so there's not much to compare him to.

Bran Stark: Bran's wolf protects him, guides him, and acts as his legs when he needs something.  This can be seen as a foreshadow that Bran would be able to control him and become the wolf.  Summer is now his weapon of sorts, and guardian.

Robb Stark:  Robb quickly became known as the Youngwolf in combat during the war of Five Kings.  The wolf became an icon of himself, and he was said to be able to turn into a wolf on the field of battle.  This sort of arc is closed when the Frey's commit sacrilege by attaching his dead direwolves head to his beheaded corpse post-Mortem.",10,8,False,self,,,,,

He didn't take his Duty seriously and lacked the honour his father followed. -understandably because he was brought up to be a Lord and not a King. He pissed off his banner men and didn't keep his Oaths. Along with the ""King of the North"" title given to him, He was probably arrogant and a little bit ignorant, taking his status for granted.

There are also subtle and not so subtle things that you can pick up on, Like when Frey starts oogling his wife and being very crude, he ultimately allows it. There's also a moment when the feast is happening, Talisa says ""don't insult them"" when Robb and Talisa are fooling around.

Well, if you like Arya maybe it's fine but she's been irrelevant throught the entire show and her existence was collateral (i.e. she is usually jumping from a relevant character to other but never moving plot by herself, not even she's granted the power to change the course of events).

Then we have Stannis. I never wtf'd more about a character in my life. I kinda like his persona but the storywriting fucks him up so hard that it makes it really hard to root for him. I mean he is some short of half hearted fanatic. Sometimes you see him full of that Lord of Light bogus but all of a sudden says ""fuck it, I'll leave Melissandre behind right when we're gonna have the fight of our lives"". Then in season 5 is fail after fail, after fail. I mean, even before leaving Castle Black it was clear he was going to lose. Then he burns his daughter... To melt the snow?! A bunch of leeches fron Gendry supposedly killed the usurpers but an entire daughter just melts some snow? Isn't that an awful bargain? To be honest the whole season 5 felt to Stannis like South Park did to Chef when the actor decided to quit.

Brienne in S5 is a lot like Arya pre-S5. Completely irrelevant character that gets some screen time because it's quite likeable by some people but that doesn't move any plot. Other relevant characters keep her alive in the show but all she does is coming across them. Like she finds Sansa, she talks a little, no one cares, everything goes on as planned without her. At least, unlike Arya, she has a little weight in the story with the valiryan steel sword so maybe she will have a role in the future. But that's it, every Brienne scene is filling material she doesn't have the weight she has in the books (I didn't read them, just read things from people who did).

The Daenerys storyline is stalling too much and is really annoying. Althought I admit this is just personal taste and Daenerys is a character liked by many, everything about it seems pointless considering the weight she's supposed to have in the story. Daenerys' character is alredy developed, it doesn't evolve much in S5. She wants to free slaves, that's pretty clear. She's struggling with decissions, that's clear too. Her story mirrors Cercei's. Cercei makes her council smaller and give power to a bunch of fanatics to find herself backstabbed by her own move while Daenerys makes her council bigger while a bunch of fanatics rise against her to find herself in a predicament after the decisive fight against them. I guess they want to compare ruling methods, following the words of Tywin Lannister when he talks to Tommen in the tomb of his brother. Still, all this could've been bypassed by including Bran's story instead and omit the Jorah - Dany and the Grey Worm - Meissande drama like they did with the ""what happened to the dothraki leftovers?"". All in all, again, I understand Daenerys is a main character and a beloved one and would be hard to just leave her out for an entire season, but her plot this season looked dull compared to her previous seasons.

Little finger moves ten times more plot than any other forementioned character and reveals more stuff about events that happenned with half the screentime. I hate this character and love him at the same time but he is the most consistent character of all (in the show). He is the main player of the game of thrones, every other character just moves as a consecuence of Baelish's actions and he is still untouched. It seems like the actual game is Baelish vs Varys (and it showed it many times with both of them discussing in front of the Iron Throne) but Varys' been skipping turns fortifying his position while Baelish was using all his pieces around the board.

I also hate this witty character and his sidekick thing that's going on too. Like Tyrion + Jorah or Jaime + Bronn. But that's personal taste, I understand that, after all, it's a Tv Show and things like that are a must sometimes. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't because all the other weak stories.

Jon Snow story in this season was amazing. Always liked the character and he's been doing so much to keep the story interesting. For me this season was worth only because of him. Only it pisses me off the dire wolf mechanic. As in ""when we don't know how to end a scene a dire wolf will show up, but when it makes the most sense for it to show but it's hellah inconvinient for the way we want the scene to go it will be missing as randomly as it showed the other times"".

As a finisher I'd like to say that this is just a personal rant, I didn't want to offend anyone if they liked this or that, this is still my favourite show for now but the people I know irl don't like GoT too much so I don't get the chance to discuss about it and I learned soooo much by the people here on the subreddit.

That said thank you very much if you read this long ass text and I wish you a lovely day.
Cheers.

http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Season_6 

Winter has come.

Westeros braces for a winter which may become a new Long Night, as the White Walkers and their army of the dead are poised to strike against the Wall and the realms of men.

In King's Landing, Queen Cersei Lannister has been publicly shamed by the Faith of the Seven and awaits her trial for regicide and incest. Even Grand Maester Pycelle has abandoned her, and called her uncle, Ser Kevan Lannister, to rule as the new Hand of the King. Even though Cersei has been released to their custody, her inept leadership nearly destroyed House Lannister's hold on the throne and they have no intention of ever letting her wield power again. Kevan and Pycelle must attempt to mend the damage Cersei did to the Lannister-Tyrell alliance. The Lannisters and Tyrells on Kevan's Small Council maintain a shaky truce as they attempt to deal with the ongoing debt crisis to the Iron Bank of Braavos, as well as the rise of the fanatical Faith Militant due to Cersei's blunders. Cersei meanwhile, though seemingly humbled, still has a few schemes she will attempt to play to regain control.

In the North, the Boltons have triumphed over King Stannis  but in the distraction, Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy have escaped, desperately jumping off Winterfell's castle walls. Brienne of Tarth, who executed Stannis, must now deal with the consequences of putting her vow to avenge King Renly before her oath to protect Sansa.

In Dorne, Ellaria Sand's poisoning of Cersei's daughter, the Princess Myrcella, may now force Doran Martell into the war against the Iron Throne he has been fervently trying to avoid.

Across the Narrow Sea, in the Free City of Braavos, Arya Stark killed Meryn Trant without the Faceless Men's permission  and without the proper training, the use of one of their masks has poisoned her and rendered her blind. Her training continues, as the now blind girl must learn to rely on her other senses to survive.

In Slaver's Bay, Daenerys Targaryen's attempt to liberate Meereen has resulted in massive bloodshed, with the former slave masters conspiring to retake the city. In a large scale ambush on the opening day of the games in Daznak's Pit however, Daenerys climbed onto Drogon's back to try to escape the danger  but she could not make him return to the city. Instead, the young dragon flew north to the southern border of the Dothraki Sea, the lands of his birth, where the stranded Daenerys has been surrounded by a hostile Dothraki khalasar numbering in the thousands. Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis have set out to search for her. Meanwhile, back in the city Daenerys's advisors Tyrion Lannister, Missandei, and Grey Worm are joined by Varys in attempting to hold together rule over the city wracked by the ongoing insurgency until Daenerys returns  if she returns at all.

At the Wall, Lord Commander Jon Snow attempted to prepare for the coming of the White Walkers by letting as many wildlings through to the south as he could  but tens of thousands more were killed and resurrected as undead wights at Hardhome. The leading Night's Watch officers, increasingly upset at Jon's proposed alliance with the wildlings, have staged a mutiny ""for the Watch"" and stabbed Jon multiple times until he fell.

Just before the mutiny against Jon Snow, he sent away Samwell Tarly to go to the Citadel in Oldtown in order to train to be a new maester to replace Maester Aemon after his passing. Samwell takes Gilly and her young son with him, rather than leave them in the path of the White Walkers. Oldtown, Westeros's second largest city, is located in the southwest of the Reach, not far away from Sam's former home, the House Tarly castle-seat at Horn Hill. Samwell and Gilly, however, face a long and difficult sea voyage before they get to the Citadel.

Distracted by the political intrigues in King's Landing, the exhausted lords of Westeros must now brace for the rise of the kraken  the ironborn led by House Greyjoy. Early in the War of the Five Kings, Balon Greyjoy declared the Iron Islands' independence and raided the North while the Stark's army was fighting in the south. Having remained relatively uninvolved ever since, the ironborn's massive fleet remains at full strength, a fact lost on the major powers of the mainland, who have been nearly exhausted fighting each other.

All of this changes with the sudden return of Balon's exiled younger brother Euron Greyjoy  cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and more than a little insane, he strikes fear even into the other ironborn  who pushes for the ironborn to launch massive new offensives against the other kingdoms, not simply to raid, but to hold and conquer territory, as Euron's ultimate ambition is nothing less than to conquer all of the Seven Kingdoms. He is opposed by Balon's daughter Yara Greyjoy, who urges that the Iron Islands must preserve their strength and engage in diplomacy with the mainland if they are to survive.

And as the winds of winter begin to sweep through the south, far Beyond the Wall the young Bran Stark has been staying with the last of the Children of the Forest and his new mentor, the Three-eyed raven, in order to hone his abilities of warging and the Sight. Bran will not walk again, but he has learned to fly.",24,9,False,self,,,,,

Her absence is immediately noticed by both Tywin and Cersei and IIRC she is accused to some extent later in the season. 

So, as a result of this, why is it that no one suspects Littlefinger of involvement in Joffrey's assassination? In S5 he reveals his plans to Cersei for Sansa to wed the Boltons, showing the Queen that he has been in custody of her for some time. In addition, he was conveniently absent from the Royal Wedding, a major event that he, a former member of the small council, would have been invited to, and expected to attend. 

Knowing Cersei's character, that she flies off the handle and makes wild assumptions for far less, why is it that she doesn't suspect Littlefinger. Even if the argument can be made that he used Tyrion as a scapegoat, Tywin would think about it rationally, and has already made it clear that he deeply distrusts Baelish, and it would be fairly out of character for him to just blindly follow his daughter's suggestion. 

So is there a reasonable explanation for the fact that no one calls out Littlefinger, and am I missing it? Or is this some sort of PIS? ",11,4,False,self,,,,,

What if the creators start purposely showing pictures of Kit at games with his hair not cut, reports of him drinking with cast mates near shoots, are all set up as a big ruse to troll us in the end?

Over the next months we'll hear rumors of him on set, the twitter feeds of cast mates with secret encoding in the text that Kit is filming. The internet will go crazy that Jon is really alive. The directors will show snippets of ""The Making Of's"" with Kit mysteriously on set in the background leading everyone on that Jon is going to get resurrected and everyone can go back to being happy and sleeping good at night again.

Then the first episode airs and it's the Night's Watch burning his body and the NW saying ""And now his Watch is ended"" and that's the last of Jon.

I think it is all going to be set up as a massive troll. They did it with the Benjen quote in the last episode. I'm worried it could be happening again.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

They are cold as death, cold enough to shatter steel with their bare hands. All swords used against them were broken, all except one, Lightbringer. Worked for 100 days, the blade was finally cooled in the hurt of a beloved. Azor Ahai used that sword to lead the First Men too take back the Seven Kingdoms. While he died, and Lightbringer was lost, it was said he would return, wielding the sword blessed by the Lord of Light to fight for the Dawn

This is the prophesy every follower of R'hllor knows, for they have seen it in the fire, time and time again. Who the Prince that is Promised, we don't know. Melisandre believed it to be Stannis, while a street preacher in the Essos seemed to think it is Daenerys (or at least, thought that saying as much would be good fro recruitment).

In any case, the Lord of Light has made sure his/her/it's followers know this prophesy, so it's logical that the Great Other would also know this, and make sure his/her/it's followers, the White Walkers, should be on the look out for Azor Ahai as well.

So, they when a White Walker came down to mop up the leaders of the Wildings, to it's shock it found that it's spear of ice was stopped by what appeared to be a normal sword, only to die to the blade.

As far as we are aware, when Jon Snow killed a White Walker with Longclaw, this was the first time the White Walkers have ever encountered Valyrian Steel. The first War for the Dawn happened thousands of years before Valyrian had even discovered their dragons, let alone whenever they first started to forge Valyrian steel.

As far as the White Walkers are aware, there is only one sword that can kill them, Light Bringer. So, they must assume the person wielding Lightbringer must be the Prince that was Promised. So, this Brother of the Night's Watch, who wielded a blade that killed one of the Walkers, must be Azor Ahai.

That is why the Night King came down personally to the shore just to taunt Jon Snow with a display of his power. The Night King believes Jon is *their* great enemy, the one who can lead the living against the dead. The only way to defeat this Messiah is to break his will, to make Jon fearful and hopeless.

This theory is entirely independent of the fact of Jon Snow actually being Azor Ahai or not. It is clear the information given to the followers of the Lord of Light can be vague and misinterpreted, we can assume the same for the White Walkers and the Great Other as well. Maybe the White Walker's are correct, maybe they will spend the next two seasons searching for the wrong (and quite possibly Dead) man, but they are coming to the right/wrong conclusion based on simply never encountering Valyarian Steel up too this point.

**TL:DR** White Wallkers think Jon is Azor Ahai because they think Longclaw is Lightbringer.",33,52,False,self,,,,,

Since the scale first showed up on Jorah's wrist after his tiff with the Stone Men, we can assume that it will spread up his arm and onto his hand simultaneously, which will render his hand useless.

Now lets imagine that for some unknown reason, Dany somehow get's her sexy on for Jorah. They're alone in the royal chambers of Meereen, talking and laughing over some Velantian wine and Dothraki cheese, when Dany notices *that* look in Jorah's eye. She slowly unties the fastening holding up her royal blouse, which falls and reveals her soft, supple breasts. Jorah, eyes wide, appreciates her beauty with a look of lust and longing for what he's sought after for so long. Finally, after an awkward pause, Ser Jorah reaches up to grope the Queen's bosom, only to knock her in the chest with a chunk of scaly goodness. 

Dany gets Grayscale and Jorah didn't get laid. Thus ends the Targaryen Dynasty and Ser Jorah's will to live.

I'm only a chapter or two past the red wedding so if there is further mention of this later in the books please tag em up. Thanks :)

So in the book. Robb leaves Jeyne as he goes to the Freys. She runs after, they kiss and hug a bit more, he leaves her behind. He dies. No mention of her apart from she's the reason for his betrayal right?

In the show though. She is there with him and they both die. While she's pregnant. The Robb Stark line never happens.

But what if George has it in store for us. A Stark son has been born far away and it's yet to be revealed because of the chaos the realm is in.

How would the show pull that shit off after killing his wife?

I really don't know much of Jeyne so this could be way off and she's dead or something already just later in the books or she did sneak away.

So let's assume it's true and Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and let's say he is revived to continue that storyline. I like it and think it's true, but I'm wondering what the significance is. Why does it matter? A couple of issues I have with it:

*With Stannis dead, it would make him the rightful king to the Iron Throne by all Westeros laws (I think?). But why would anyone care? Clearly it's not a prerequisite, as Robert took the throne by force. Several people think/thought they have a claim for whatever reason. Regardless, I doubt he'll gain any supporters as a Targ.

*Would the North still support Jon Snow if they know his heritage? I'm sure there's some bad blood between the Northerners and the Targs, seeing as how they brutally murdered the former Warden of the North and his heir, and allegedly captured, raped, and caused the death of Lyanna (in addition to the whole war thing). Being the son of Rhagegar would presumably make him more Targ than Stark, yes?

*Is there any way to prove who his parents are? I presume there isn't any kind of CSI forensics team or Jerry Springer that can test his DNA (unless there's some defining characteristic in Targ blood). Proof aside, I'm not sure who would be willing to spread that information who is also someone Westeros people would believe/trust.

*And let's assume Jon Snow figures out who his parents are. Would he care? He saw what's coming. The only way I can see him leaving the Wall is if he thinks he can gain some kind of power in Westeros and recruit more soldiers and gather more tools, but I'm not sure if him being a Targ changes anything for him.

tl;dr: Basically I'm just wondering what the likely scenario(s) is if R+L=J is true and why it's significant. I guess maybe Baelish can use him? Let me know if I'm wrong on anything. Thanks for any answers!",29,16,False,self,,,,,

In S3, its established that the Unsullied train from young, day and night until they have mastered the sword, shield and spear:

&gt; For over a decade until they are full-grown, they train from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, shield, and three lengths of spear, as well as their training to fight together as organized phalanxes.

So this argument that I was seeing when it happened that they weren't as proficient in tight spaces is actually complete bullocks and this also means that the Unsullied should have made meat out of the SotH in any field in which they engaged.

Also, near the end of S1, when Ser Barristan is ""retired"", just before he throws his sword down on the floor with his cloak and other effects, he addresses the 5 King's Guard standing at the foot of the Iron Throne saying:

I've heard that the pacing/ character stories divert, which makes sense.

I can't wait to read the next 2 and see how they crammed that into 1 season.

Anyway, I've also had different feelings about the characters, and I'm interested to get your opinions as well.
For me, I think I like how much less Cersei has in the books. I like her season 1 scenes, especially with Robert, but she's been getting more stale and one dimensional. I think her character is treated better as thoughts in Tyrion's and Jaime's chapters.
Second is Catelyn. I remember not liking her so much in the show. However, the books allow for internal musings, and half of her chapters are her thoughts. Seeing all this doubt and struggle going on in her head made her a much deeper character (though props to Michelle Fairley who killed the role)

We see the development of Arya, Daenerys, Tyrion, and most importantly, we see flashbacks to the past through Bran, filling us in on what really happened in the recent past (R+L=J?).  
We see the whole Sparrow Vs. Cersei Cleganebowl ultimate showdown (WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE).

But that also makes me wonder where a lot of characters will go, because if it all ends with the big battle/the prophecy proves itself true, will the other characters still have screentime? It wouldn't really make sense if we see the big fight and then randomly cut to Arya killing some douche or to Brienne being all Brienne and shit. A lot of these characters will probably die until it all comes to the end, but I feel Arya will play a bigger part than some other characters. Mainly, because everybody is always like ""It's all in the books, R+L=J, ..."", and it's true, when you know the theory the first few chapters feel so obvious about the whole Jon Snow story. But I noticed that Arya also had a lot of similar, ""subtle"" parts written about her. Mainly the whole ""She's literally like Lyanna Stark"" thing. The way this gets expressed in the books is very similar to the way R+L = J gets expressed. So, where is Arya right now? Because of her blindness, she needs to wear random faces all the time. So will Maisie Williams just get kicked out of the show and we follow some random dude/girl killing people? I don't think so. I do think we may very well not see a lot of Maisie Williams as Arya anymore, though. 
___________________________________________________

Reading about the cast for season 6, we may get some tower of joy action soon. So we may see some new actor cast as Lyanna Stark. Obviously, Lyanna is one of the most hyped characters that never appeard alive in the books or show. So what if, after we've seen the whole tower of joy story, and haven't heard from Arya for a while, suddenly someone like Cersei gets some Olly-level stabbing from ... Lyanna Stark. Everybody's going crazy and then it's revealed that Arya found the face of Lyanna in the hall of faces. So we lose Maisie Williams but the newly cast actor for Lyanna can stay. Maybe the show even merges some of LSH's storyline into this. So after a while, Arya/Lyanna joins forces with her brother/son, Jon Snow. There a so many possible storylines in this, Jon can hate her and/or love her (and make his ancestors proud by banging his sistermother). How will Arya go with this? Will she reveal that she is Arya after all, maybe, with the upcoming battle against the White Walkers renounce the many faced god again but gets away with it and stays as Lyanna? Also, why was Lyannas face in the halll in the first place? What happend back then? Because Howland Reed is probably there already, he can tell us, right? How were the faceless men involved in all this? The potential storylines, can't you see them? So yeah, that's it.

**TL;DR: Arya + face = Lyanna confirmed.**

This just came to me so I don't have it super well thought out or a plethora of evidence but I am wondering about 2 things. 

1)  Is Tristan Martell the gift of a lovely young man he promised to lady Olenna?

2)  Is Littlefinger actually the valonqar?

Dealing with 1 first.

He promises Lady Olenna the gift of a lovely young man.  Tristan is on his way (theoretically) to Westrose with Myrcella.  We know that Olenna and LF planned the death of Joffrey to destabilize the Lannisters.  We know that both of them are being extremely burdened and threatened by Cersei and her craziness as well as Tommen and his weakness thus threatening both their futures.  

Is it possible that LF knew about and or helped to arrange the death or Myrcella on her return trip from Dorne?  If he did that would mean he knew that Tristan would become a very important bargaining chip and that Cersei would do anything to get a hold of him after she finds out about Myrcella.  So in giving that chip to Lady Olenna, he gives her ultra power not only over Cersei but also a good chip to use with Dorne and then Lady O is in debt to LF because he gave her a bargaining chip that can almost certainly get Cersei to free Loras and Margery.  It fits with his past of doing big things and using other larger houses to shield him from any suspicion or repercussions.  And given that his beloved brothel had been destroyed I can see that being something that would push him to do something so bold.

This leads into #2 which is more tinfoil.

Is LF actually the valonqar?  Valonqar is valyrian for little brother.  Everyone suspects that the prophecy by Maggy the frog refers to either Jaime or Tyrion.  While it appears that LF is an only child, Catlyn referred to him as being like ""a little brother"" and right now LF is at least partially responsible for the death of Joffrey and if my #1 theory is correct the death of Myrcella as well.  From there LF can easily help to cause the death of Tommen thereby being responsible for the death of all 3 of Cersei's children.  When she finally finds out it would possibly be in the same manner as when he killed Lysa Aryn.  She confronts him, he strangles her and while he does it, lets her know he is the one who killed all her kids.  

We have seen with lady mel how ""prophecy"" can be misunderstood by people.  She thought Stannis was AA because of a misunderstanding of a prophecy, what if the valonqar/little brother is not actually Tyrion or Jaime, but someone whom was considered to be a little brother to others?

ALSO LF was directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of Ned, Cat and Rob (he likely knew about the RW beforehand) Lysa Aryn, by extension John Aryn, Joffrey and possibly Myrcella.

It would seem that LF who Catlyn called a little brother is actually quite a murderous bastard and I think it would be right in line with Martin to make everyone think that a Lannister would be the valonqar when in fact it would be the guy who has been the master mind behind nearly every important death in Westrose since the story began.

All he had to do was not do the wildfire trick, and maybe send a raven or something to Dragonstone to tell Stannis he had a short friend in KL ready to let him in to the city - and he would have been set for life. No more Joff or Cersei - Tommen would be safe because he knows Stannis wouldn't kill a little kid for having the wrong family name.

Post gelding, Theon seems emotionally dependent on Ramsay and do whatever he said. Yet, in the fake-out escape attempt, Theon seems to think he deserves what he got for making his decisions. At the time, it seemed played off as an arrogant character hitting a tragedy and thinking it justice. Yet, when Theon speaks to Sansa and confesses his actions, he makes it seem like he was not completely broken by Ramsay, rather that he simply saw no way out and just gave up. The key difference here I am curious about is if he was truly broken, he could never recover his personality right? So did he, in the face of the adversity, hide his emotions so he could escape at a later date? This idea seems interesting, but is compounded by the fact that Theon betrays Moat Cailan, when he could have simply joined up and escaped Ramsay. So does anyone have any thoughts?

This is my co-worker's theory, so he gets the credit. Not sure if it's already been circulated, but it goes something like this...

Let's say the White Walker dude at the end of the Hardhome episode--the come-at-me-bro guy who did the mass zombification--is actually the Night's King. This has actually been somewhat leaked, to my understanding.

[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night's_King](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night's_King)

So where's the Night's Queen? Well, what if we've already met her? What if she's Melisandre, acting as a double agent, sabotaging the south? She thought Stannis really did have the best chance, so she wanted to corrupt him. Sure, she has to help some, like with the shadow that kills Renly, but that's just eliminating more potential enemies anyway, so why not?

Sure, sure, the description of her has her with blue eyes and blueish, white features. But Melisandre is pale, and the rest could be some sort of glamour. We've already learned in the books that she can do that, as with Mance.

She's so friggin' powerful, in ways we haven't necessarily seen the other followers of R'hllor being. She has this cover story about being a former slave, but has anyone corroborated that? How'd she get so powerful without everyone knowing who she is?

A few cool quotes that make this even more spookily plausible:

Melisandre has gone to Stannis entirely on her own, and has her own agenda.
 George R. R. Martin

Lady Melisandre wore no crown, but every man there knew that she was Stannis Baratheons real queen.
 Jon Snow's thoughts

Just a thought. Would be wild to see her wave her hands and turn completely white/blue haired, revealing herself, next season/book. Possible? Impossible?",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Partially to take advantage of the fact that television is a visual medium, and partially because they can't show boobs all the time. In any case, they have added, or expanded, many fights in comparison to the books. If that is a good or bad thing is up to debate and is not particularly relevant for this theory.

Anyway, we know one battle that will come in both the books and the series, Cersei's trial by combat. It is clear, after literally beating a confession out of Cersei, the High Sparrow will never give her a fair trial. Not that any trial in Westeros is ever fair, but it would be an ""open up the Moongate"" level of Kangaroo court, not helped by the fact Cersei is guilty of her charges. So, with a new giant suit of armor that vaguely acts like a man on her side, Trial by Combat seems like an easy option. Any champion the High Sparrow has, or atleast all the ones Cersei knows about *coughGravediggercough* would be utterly obliterated.

It is clear, in the books, this trial will be a duel to the death (or second death, in Robert Strong's case), a deeply personal fight for the fate of a woman who essentially ruled Westeros.

I believe the show will go in a slightly... different option, a trial by Seven.

[As Bronn explains in this Lore video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfdHzrdElT0), a trial by Seven is a trial by combat on steroids. Seven men vs. seven men, last side with anyone standing has the favor of the Gods. This will allow several of the Sparrows to die horribly to Robert, because the writers won't otherwise be able to show off how dangerous Robert Strong is in any other way (like how George did it in the books, showing how inhuman Robert is, and explicitly stating Robert's weapon and armor are too heavy for any normal man to even lift). This will allow Robert's true rival, whoever that ultimately is *coughGravediggercough* to show his abilities against Robert Strong's allies, and maybe, just maybe, show that the person in question might just be able too kill a Mountain.

The High Sparrow may demand it, hoping to lessen the advantage that Robert presents, while Cersei may demand it just to prove who holds the real power in King's Landing (and sanity is *not* her strong point at the moment).",19,7,False,self,,,,,

My dad is really wanting to watch Game of Thrones, but he doesn't have the internet to support streaming. He does have a smart TV, so I was thinking I could load him a large USB stick with a couple seasons on it and mail it to him. His TV is relatively large, so it really should be HD.

I don't want to illegally download it, I want to support HBO in this venture. I know that the Blu-Rays come with a digital version, but it would seem annoying to buy them when in reality I just want the digital download version. It doesn't look like you can download Amazon videos you buy digitally, and with iTunes  it looks like you can only download it if you're device is connected to my apple account.

Is there even a legal way to get the digital version in HD as a plain DRM-free video file?",9,3,False,self,,,,,

And what does the Blackfyre rebellion have to do with anything?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3cojuv/all_spoilerstheory_whats_really_going_on_and_what/,Exodus111,1436453302,"We know there are secrets, well crafted, deeply hidden secrets going on in this Song of Ice and Fire. And some of the pieces are becoming more obvious, the Secret Targaryens, the prophecies. But who is the old man Bran meets? Is he Brynden Rivers?

For those that don't know Brynden Rivers (aka Lord Bloodraven) is a Targaryen Bastard, rumored to have magical abilities, despite being thought of as a sorcerer he was hand of the King to two kings, Aerys the first and Maekar the First, and then served as Commander of the Nights watch. He also was the one to call for the Great Council of 233 that Elected Aegon the fifth to sit the throne.

**Aegon the fifth was also known as Egg in his youth. [Remember that scene?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eid0-IE4Ejs)**

Brynden Rivers was arrested and sent to take the black, escorted by none other then Ser Duncan the Tall of the Kingsguard, he quickly rose in the ranks and became Lord Commander, only to disappear while ranging north of the wall some years later.

And all this brings us to the Blackfyre rebellion, part 1 and 2 and 3... For those that don't know, once upon a time Aegon the Fourth (Aegon the unworthy) had a lot of Bastards. You think Robert was into women on the side, this dude lived it. And on his deathbed he, as his last official act as King, legitimized all his Bastard Children. Many of who formed house Blackfyre.

This of course created a contention for the throne, primarily between the elder Daemon Blackfyre (what a name) and the trueborn Daerion the Second (Daerion the Good).      
But it is widely known that this matter was settled by none other then Brynden Rivers, Hand of the King to Daerion the Good. Despite being a legitimized bastard himself, he vehemently opposed the Blackfyre claim, so much so that he ultimately broke his own word to  Aenys Blackfyre at the Great Council, promising safe passage to Aneys to put forth his claim to the throne at the council, and then breaking his vow (Frey style) and having Aenys beheaded before the council started, this is the reason he was ultimately arrested and took the black.

But all in all, was he a bad guy? Daerion the good was... good. One of the best Kings of the Targaryen line, and Aegon the fifth was... perhaps even better. Lord Blackfyre, despite his faults had a knack for calling the right Kings... or did he?

Another Targaryen trait, beside the occasional Fire resistance and Dragon taming, is the ability to foresee the future, indeed it is the reason the Targaryen household moved to Westeros before the Doom of Valyria in the first place. And its an ability that's been popping up down the Targaryen line for centuries. Not the least of which during the Blackfyre rebellion. Visions of Dragons rising, and attempts at hatching a Dragon egg are all part of that history. I absolutely recommend picking up the Dunk and Egg shorts if you haven't already.

And that is my point really, BOY did GRRM put a lot of thought into this recent history, so much so he wrote a bunch of short stories set in that time. And he and the show keeps subtly hinting at this big thing that happened not too long ago, that changed so many things, but that ultimately has no bearing on what is currently going on... or does it?

**TL:DR; What's up with the Blackfyre rebellion. It's tin foil hat time!**

A popular theory here seems to be that they are **mercenaries that switched sides**, since Stannis's horse did abandon him not long earlier. However, the more I think about it (with my tinfoil hat on) the more I think that might be wrong.

**Littlefinger has been heading north with the Knights of the Vale**. They are mounted, of course. Perhaps they arrived and joined forces with the Boltons, and so what we saw in the battle was the combined Bolton-Littlefinger armies slaughtering Stannis?

The main objection I can think of to this theory is that Littlefinger explained his mission to Cersei as ""wait to see which of the Boltons and Stannis is left standing, and take them out"", after which he would be recognized as Warden of the North by the Crown. Joining the Boltons seems like a change in his plans. However,

 * We don't actually know what his plans ever were. We only know what he told Cersei. He told the Boltons something different, and perhaps that was closer to the truth.
 * Perhaps he was without a fixed plan, and when he saw he arrived before the battle - as Stannis was delayed by the snows - he felt the best option was to appear to honor his pact with the Boltons, instead of staying off to the side and waiting - which might be quite some time, given a siege, during which he would need to find food for his knights. That seems unacceptable, so it would mean he must join either the Boltons or Stannis. The Boltons then seem the obvious choice.
 * He has no real loyalty to the Lannisters, after all. As he said, the Vale can stand with the North against the Crown - it worked before, in Robert's Rebellion. Making sure my tinfoil hat is in place, perhaps he knows and/or is involved in the strife between the Crown and Dorne, and so he knows the Crown may face war in the south soon, meaning that he and the Boltons are in no danger, and in fact can expand their territories southwards (he can betray them later at his leisure, of course).

A further reason for my suspicions is that the other theory, that the extra horse are mercenaries that switched sides, depends on two things:

 * The Boltons having enough coin to pay them. Stannis had to take a loan from the Iron Bank to do so - do the Boltons have enough?
 * It seems risky to a mercenary's reputation to switch sides that quickly.

They live for a long time and many die of old age or are killed by another dragon. Notable exceptions include those killed in the [Storming of the Dragonpit](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Storming_of_the_Dragonpit), where rebels entered the domed building in which the dragons were kept and slew 5 dragons, though many died in the process. The dragons were chained, unable to fly away and were not mounted at the time. Four died in the pit (Dreamfyre, Tyraxes, Morghul and Shrykos), with Dreamfyre being the only full-grown, combat-ready dragon. The fifth, Syrax, was not at the Dragonpit. She bucked Joffrey Velaryon (who tried to mount her even though she was not his) en route to the Dragonpit. Riderless, Syrax went to the ground with the rebels and fought them, eventually dying. If she had stayed in the air and used her fire-breath, she probably would have lived. Dreamfyre lost an eye in the Dragonpit to an arrow, but it didn't kill her directly. She tried to escape, flying up into the dome and causing it to collapse, killing her and many people. Meraxes, mounted by Rhaenys Targaryen, died in Dorne, when a bolt miraculously went through her eye and into her brain. This is the only dragon known to die from a projectile.

The White Walkers are like superhumans. They are incredibly athletic and have the power to raise the dead into wights. It isn't known how many White Walkers exist. The wights are similar to humans, but they are undead and seem to feel no pain. They will continue to fight if they lose limbs or even their head. They are completely controlled by the Walkers. Wights are very susceptible to fire, while Walkers seem to have resistance to it (the Walker Jon fought at Hardhome, for instance). The Walkers are incredible fighters, but they seem to use numbers to defeat humans. Every loss of life for humans becomes a +1 for the Walkers. That's what makes them so fearsome.

So here's my question:

How do the White Walkers stand a chance against dragons? Let's say that Daenerys eventually makes her way to Westeros with three dragons. She has already mounted Drogon. If Drogon is anything like Balerion, he will grow very large. If Viserion and Rhaegal allow mounts, that makes three dragons with riders, as well as some type of human force.

I can't remember off the top of my head whether or not Walkers/wights use projectile weapons, but my gut answer is no. Only one dragon EVER has been killed by a lucky projectile shot anyway. Other dragons have been taken down by sheer manpower (projectiles probably at least contributed to those deaths). Tyrion, now an adviser to Daenerys and pretty much a dragon expert, will know that Syrax only died because she didn't have a mount who would have kept her in the air, burning the rebels at the Dragonpit. Wights go up like gasoline when they are lit on fire. Aren't the Walkers essentially marching a giant tinderbox south?

Three dragons with mounts + a human army vs. Walkers + wights with literally no way to fight them = Walker/wight bloodbath . Yes, the Walkers have fire resistance, but dragonfire isn't regular fire.

So IF Dany goes to Westeros and IF Tyrion is still an adviser (possibly a dragonrider?) and WHEN winter comes south, HOW do the dragons lose? All they have to do is keep the dragons in the air and breathing fire. Don't land on the ground. And since the wights/walkers don't use arrows (I don't think), fly as low you like and light them up.

So, barring a gargantuan ice dragon, how could the Walkers ever defeat even a single dragon, never mind three?",27,16,False,self,,,,,

I ordered the whole set from Amazon, as well as a copy of The World of Ice and Fire (it was suggested by Amazon and I'm easily convinced), and had a question about the latter. 

My question is whether or not I should be worried about any major spoilers in TWoIaF as I casually flip through it. I know that sounds a little strange, but outside of what's in the show, I don't know much of the book's story besides a few more recent plot changes, and don't want anything different spoiled for me. So I'm wondering if there's anything in the history book that could potentially spoil something major or cool from the series itself, or if it's strictly background material. 

I hope that made sense. Thanks in advance for any help!",4,1,False,self,,,,,

S04E04: Oathkeeper is the first time Jaime sees Tyrion in his cell since he was arrested for the false accusation of regicide. It shows the connection the two have as brothers, which is something that isn't shown between Tyrion and another family member.

http://youtu.be/XQ0OCYqOOKY

S04E08: The Mountain and the Viper is my favorite too. As soon as their scene starts you can feel the insecurity of Tyrion while Jaime is steady as a rock to comfort his brother. They drown out the harsh reality of the situation with light small talk. It steadily moves into darker territory with Tyrion wondering why someone can mindlessly, or intentionally, kill harmless beings with little to no remorse. I also like the tiny line Jaime says referring to killing cousins because, you know, he did that.

The first theory is probably the most talked about and speculated theory in current circulation. This is the theory that Jon is Azor Ahai and that he will be resurrected by Melissandre. The fact that Mel sees ""Snow"" in the fire is indicative of another meaning. The Snow she is seeing is most likely a metaphor for Jon himself and his eventual rebirth. To further this concept I believe that her ""misinterpretation"" of the visions relates to her thinking that STANNIS is the person these visions are about. The truth is Jon betrayed EVERYONE in the nights watch by allowing wildlings to come south of the wall and also layed with a wildling woman. This betrayal happened of its own accord by Jon doing the RIGHT THING!! Stannis burning his daughter and doing terrible things to gain power is not how you become a symbol for hope. Jon literally embodies the perfect leader and honorable man (most likely from his lessons from Ned Stark). Completely avoiding and skipping any theory involving Jon being a Targ bastard, he fits the bill for Azor Ahai. He doesn't need a dragon, he doesn't need to be a Targ, he can be the bastard Snow and still be Azor Ahai.

His resurrection is where things can differ drastically. This is also the fork in the road for my theory. I believe in possibility (A) the most. Jon is basically a wildling, he raises a direwolf to be his best friend, he lays with a wildling, and he even commands the wildlings in a fight against the White Walker army (rescuing a TON of lives in the process). I think that he will be taken north of the wall just as he did for his lover. Before Jon's body can be burned by his now loyal Wildling followers he will worg into Ghost. Not sure WHEN this will happen, but I am 90% sure this is the path GRRM is taking. While inside Ghost his body will be reanimated by the now approaching White Walkers as a Wight... That's right while he's not in the body it will be reanimated as that's what their true ability is, controlling dead bodies after the soul has left the corpse. SO NOWWWWW, Jon can worg BACK into his body taking over the reanimated corpse. This prevents any ""loss of identity"" B.S. that comes with a direct resurrection as I believe Jon still has a very important role to play in the development of the story. This group encounters the WW's again but decide to just flee to the castle. Somehow gaining entry (obviously there are holes in this theory, direct location of events and timeline is up for interpretation). Jon will deal with all of the betrayers INCLUDING Melissandre for having deserted Stannis and learning of the blood magic sacrifice he may do the honorable thing and have her put to death. BY HIS OWN HAND as the Starks have always done. In beheading the red woman, the fucking fire priest he may actually cause some magic to engulf his sword in flame thus creating lightbringer the sword of our hero and claiming his right as Azor Ahai.

My other theory involves him just being resurrected with blood magic and teehee taking some revenge on the people that betrayed him. Leading the wildlings south to take back Winterfell and abandoning Castle Black (Sam already left behind books/scrolls/history) meaning that it really holds no importance anymore, the knowledge available at Castle Black has been used up. After defeat Ramsay Bolton and gaining the support of the Northern Houses he will rally together everyone in the north and STAY in the North to fight the White Walkers. I don't think Jon cares about conquering or spreading his rule to other parts of Westeros. With the North and being a true Stark in nature he will probably end up fighting the WW's with help from Bran and the weirwoods as well as the children of the forest. I think the fighting will ultimately end in either him becoming the next Night's King (something like a Diablo deal) or with just defeating the entire WW army with the help of the Northern Houses. Word will spread through the kingdoms of how he saved the realm just as Dany attacks to conquer it.

This is where things get particularly speculative for me. As I believe that with Ghost and the rest of the north supporting him Jon feels obligated to help the rest of the country. He will ride south and fight Dany in order to protect Westeros from any more violence. Dany has already shown some pretty fucked up madness becoming more and more similar to her father. Jon will win this war SOMEHOW and then head back to the North instilling the baratheon Bastard, GENDRY as the heir to the iron throne. This is the bittersweet ending that I think GRRM has in store. Not so much Jon dying (possible has to live in exile being a WW/Night's King) but the fact that he only acquired power in order to help the realm. He always seems willing to lay down his claim to fame for what's best in the realm and what's the most honorable thing to do. His abdication to the throne will be the last great thing he will do for Westeros before heading into the lands of always winter as the prince that was promised and as the hero that westeros never truly understood.

Lot of things in my theories change daily with much more tin foil and speculation but I think the ending is going to be VERY close to this and obviously the timeline may be different as some events may happen simultaneously or in a completely different order.

When Arya does get to the House of Black and White the doors open without any human intervention after Arya shows the coin and says the name ""Jaquen"". We also know that, initially, when she got to the House of Black and White the Kindly Man thought Arya wanted to kill herself, in his words ""You are to young to seek his favor"" and ""He'll be there for you someday, have no worry"", but when she speaks about Jaquen H'ghar and the coin he treats her like a possible recruit. He also says stuff like ""If Him of Many Faces indeed led you here to be his instrument"", meaning the coin and possibly the name Jauqen, and the fact that she got to the House of Black and White in the first place represents a sign that she was led there by the Many Faced God. What this could mean though, in my opinion, is that she wasn't brought there to be his servant, rather, the three deaths he offered before were a sort of joke, the real pay, the real three deaths are to be taken by Arya using the skills he taught her (would teach her). Or Jaquen might've been a man sent by the Many Faced God with this role, but either way it leads us to same thing. Also, Arya's name, from what I researched (though this might not be relevant) means honorable or noble, and it's both masculine and feminine (resource http://www.behindthename.com/name/arya) meaning she will avenge her family, possibly in the name of honor. Caitlyn, in book two, when she prays in the sept before Renly's battle also sees both Arya and Robb in the face of the Warrior, not that of the Stranger. In other words, Arya has three lives, one was the man of the Night's Watch she killed for her own purposes, two more are left and I have a feeling they will be significant. Or I might be saying total nonsense. What do you guys think?",9,17,False,self,,,,,

But of course that isn't what he's doing. Even if he was going to give up Sansa despite having her just a moment ago he's no military strategist and 100 men can hold Winterfell against 10'000.

I think he will rock up and offer Roose Bolton an ultimatum, fight the knights of the Vale and even if they come out on top they will be left wounded when he's harbouring a fugitive from the throne and when the North aren't fond of him either OR ride with the Vale and fight the throne, and Littlefnger will give Roose the throne in exchange for being named Warden of the North and Sansa's hand (so Roose would kill Ramsay).

From there Littlefinger rallies the North under the same motivation as Robb, and given his bride he promises that if they fight the already diminished Boltons (from fighting King's Landing) and grant him the Iron Throne he will name his heir Stark and a Northener will then be Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

I think this is believable because Peter is kind of the anti-Tywin and doesn't care much for his family name (created his own sigil which is very personally focused), as long as he gets to rule. As well as this he gets the closest thing to Catlyn possible as a bride and mother of his children.

Tl;dr Littlefinger hands the throne to Bolton's and then uses the North to take it for himself, and makes Stark his legacy

Not that any of this matters now that Sansa has bolted (no pun intended), and he was probably hoping Stannis would do a less of a shit job, but still interesting to think about because its hard to know whats going on in his master scheme.",30,14,False,self,,,,,

1642,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-7-11,2015,7,11,4,3ctyzc,self.gameofthrones,[S5/AGOT][Theory] Something that may be in the near future,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3ctyzc/s5agottheory_something_that_may_be_in_the_near/,Tillbe,1436556475,"So like everyone else, now that Season 5 is over and done with, my brain is turning and churning with what might be coming ahead next year. I've recently started reading Book 1 in the series and have been loving it, all of the vague passages regarding Ned's unknown promise to Lyanna are so intriguing and absolutely get the mind buzzing, but there was another passage that I thought was very telling on what might befall the Boltons sooner rather that later. It's in one of Jon's chapters, after he and Sam have taken the Nights Watch Oath and Ghost brings back the severed hand, a few of the Nights Watch are standing around the bodies of crows that were part of Benjen Starks scouting party, crows we eventually learn are wights. While looking at them, Jon recalls a dream he had the night previous:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*""Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he'd heard the scrape of stone on stone. When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror. He dared not go back to sleep. Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the east. It was only a dream. I am a brother of the Night's Watch now, not a frightened boy.""*

&amp;nbsp;

So I think it's safe to assume the Night's Watch is finished at this point. They barely withstood a day-long siege against Mance Rayder's army, and were only rescued out of that situation when Stannis stepped in. If the White Walkers attacked the Wall, I can't see anyone else in a position of power doing anything even remotely similar to what Stannis did, even if ravens were sent. The Wall is primed to fall from an attack by them.

&amp;nbsp;

I see them definitely making it through the wall, killing most if not all the crows there, and heading towards Winterfell. Not only does the Night's King have the corpses of Stannis' entire army resting just outside Winterfell (undead Stannis commanding his undead troops for the real battle of Winterfell) but he has the bodies of all these long dead (and not so long dead) Starks just sitting underneath the city, waiting to be risen and attack the city from within. We could see an undead (and headless?) Ned Stark with his brother Brandon and sister Lyanna along with countless other long dead Stark lords rise up to destroy the Bolton's. It's a sad thought, thinking of Ned as a wight but in a strange sense satisfying that Ned could get revenge for his son Robb by killing Roose Bolton, even if he was just an instrument of the Night's King. Just a theory, what do you guys think? Possible or not?",19,8,False,self,,,,,

Suggestions like Stannis ducked or Trystane appears with a vial of antidote or Jon's only wounded and Mel can save him are all fine, and we've let the speculation continue because it's all good fun to talk about what-ifs with any character.  But between the incredible amount of posts about whether Kit Harington has cut his hair and what it might mean to all the other actor/staff interview comments taken as hints one way or the other, the reposts need to stop.  Every news and blog site is posting articles about them, but a different site with the same story is still a repost.

So to be clear about it, the official word is Jon, Stannis, and Myrcella are all dead.  At the end of the season the HBO character pages were updated with:

* [Jon ""was murdered at Castle Black by his own men""](http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-5/episode-10/people/61/jon-snow)
* [""Stannis was killed outside of Winterfell by Brienne of Tarth""](http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-5/episode-10/people/136/stannis-baratheon)
* [""Myrcella died in the arms of Jaime Lannister""](http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-5/episode-10/people/93/myrcella-baratheon)

The wink-wink of the interviewees dancing around the topics doesn't matter.  The character biographies are pretty clear.  That in-writing documentation means all three deaths are official for discussions under an [S5] warning tag.  There is no reason to continue to post links to articles trying to generate blog hits by jumping on the not-dead hype train. 

Now that said, it's certainly possible that one or more of them will not stay dead.  There are more than a few theories for both Jon and Stannis returning from death that are very plausible.  We've already seen the Lord of Light R'hllor bring people back, and there other magical means in the story too.

You know, naively and such defending the awesomeness of her character.  The director says, ""yeah and you know, I think someday they will.""

Okay, no big surprise to anyone.  But it put an image in my mind.  

After season two we're all waiting for Dany's big return to Westeros.  I'd love her to like set sail at some point in a season and then we don't hear from her in for a few episodes.  The White Walkers attack yadda yadda.  

I'd love for Dany to just show up on Drogon, like as someone is cowering behind a rock, and just kill it, just melt the hell out of all of them.  And then she just like is like, ""Oh yeah I'm back by the way.""

So when Melisandre looked at Jon through the flames ~~of Aemon's funeral pyre~~, she saw his death and realized that he is AA. She stayed with Stannis and sacrificed Shireen for the power to revive Jon. So, if Jon is AA, that means he will ""Pull lightbringer from the flames"". Some people this is a metaphor, I think it's literal. I think Jon pulled lightbringer from the flames when he used fire to kill the wight attacking Jeor Mormont, and I think that Longclaw is lightbringer. It isn't a literal flaming sword, but a sword imbued with magic fire capable of slaying White Walkers. This probably isn't a unique theory but I just thought of it. ",96,94,False,self,,,,,

My theory follows from my two theses of this series

**Thesis 1**: All the prophecies in GoT will come to fruition, but only in a twisted, corrupted manner.


**Thesis 2**: Those who seek power will fall, while those who do not will rise.

***
##Freeing the Queen
***
We start in Essos. Jorah and Dario have found Dany being held hostage by the Dothraki. The Dothraki will not negotiate, leaving the duo to return to Mereen to rally the Unsullied to rescue their Queen. The whole gang comes along too, including Tyrion. Tyrion sweet-talks the Dothraki and promises them unlimited gold if they will release Dany and join their Unsulllied/Dragon army to Westeros. A Lannister always pays his debts.
***
##Gathering the Three Heads
***
At this point, everyone has noticed that Jorah is in the process of becoming a crazy stone monster and they exile him to Valyria. Now it's time for Dany, now in control of the Unsullied and a Dothraki khalasar to march on Westeros. The problem is...who are the other two heads of the dragon? I pondered this for a long-ass time, since we're running out of Targaryens in the world. It's pretty obvious Jon Snow is one but he's too far away. I remember Baratheons having Targ blood but thanks to Stannis being a dipshit we're out of those too. I also recall the 3 heads needing to be siblings, ruling out Tyrion since he is Dany's son not brother. So....

... who could be an offspring of the Mad King? Oh and we need two of them. They need to be between the ages of 17 and like 45 to be the right age. I couldn't see the Mad King hooking up with some random tavern slut Robert Baratheon-style so they must be high-born. And since this is GoT there must be some ironic aspect to this. Two high born adults under the age of 40... with a connection to the Mad King... with a hint of irony... maybe, idk, they are twins who have a father who cares more about family than anything. So I can now conclude that Jaime and Cersei Lannister are the other two heads of the dragon. This is further backed up by the fact that Tyrion is actually the child of Dany and Khal Drogo, meaning Tywin Lannister, the guy who cares more about legacy than anyone else in this universe, has no children to pass that legacy down to. Seems GoT to me, right?

Now, how to get those two onto the backs of those dragons? Jaime is easy, he's already on a boat supposedly heading to King's Landing with the dead Princess on board. Yea I doubt that boat's gonna end up in King's Landing if any Dornishmen aboard have an interest in keeping their heads attached to their shoulders for much longer. So that boat ends up in Essos. As for Cersei, she demands a trial by combat with her new undead giant friend.

The only problem here is I have no idea who the High Sparrow calls for the trial by combat. Lancel was once a knight but he'd get his punk ass destroyed before Maester Pycelle finishes his introduction. It'd probably be someone with a history with The Mountain like Oberyn did, right? Ser Loras once beat him in a jousting match back in season 1 but I have a funny feeling the High Sparrow won't be calling upon him. The Hound got killed at the end of season 4 (and even if he's not I doubt the High Sparrow would even choose him). Ellaria Sand would want revenge for Oberyn's death but I don't see her as much of a fighter. I don't see any of the sand snakes getting chosen by the High Sparrow either. The Mountain spent a lot of his time raiding the Riverlands, so maybe someone from the Riverlands? I don't know anyone from there that's up for the challenge. That leaves one option... Doran Martell. Ser Gregor may be the Mountain the Rides but Doran is the Viper that Rides. Rides in a wheelchair but whatever. Doran would have twice the motivation of Oberyn, seeing as the Mountain killed not one but both of his siblings. Since Doran can't walk they decide the it will be a trial by jousting instead of combat. We've already seen the Mountain lose a jousting match by the use of a mare in heat to distract the Mountain's ride. Doran uses a similar strategy by dressing as his dead sister to distract the Mountain. The Mountain, reborn in the Faith of the Seven, feels bad for his previous sins, and, due to this internal conflict, allows Doran to kill him.

With Gregor dead, Cersei is sentenced to death by her son, the King. Imagine the tears! The night before her execution, she flees the Red Keep and boards a boat for Essos. Sound familiar?

So now that Jaime and Cersei are each in Essos, how will Dany find them to get them on those dragons? Someone would have to have knowledge that they are indeed the children of the Mad King and therefore Targaryens. That person would also need to know that Cersei and Jaime are even in Essos. Wouldn't it be convenient if there was someone hanging out somewhere in Essos who just happened to know everything about everyone. Maybe that person also just became one of the most powerful people in Mereen. Idk how Varys would know Jaime and Cersei are Targaryens but if anyone would know it's has GOT to be him. Boom. Varys is all like Hey Dany I just so happen to have found your long lost brother and sister here in Essos! Oh and funny story one of them assassinated your dad lol.

Oh and I'm sure Jaime and Cersei would each have some choice words for their no-longer-brother-but-now-nephew Tyrion when they see him.
***
##On to Westeros
***
So we now have Dany, Jaime, and Cersei riding the three dragons along with an army of Unsullied and Dothraki with Varys and Illyrio Mopatis funding this expedition. Of course they kick the absolute shit out of whatever army stands between them and the Iron Throne. King Tommen dies fighting on the front lines like Joffrey never did.

Oh but what's this? There are White Walkers marching on the Wall? New Warden of the North Petyr Baelish, fresh off his victory over Roose Bolton and marriage to Sansa Stark, leads his army north. With no time for her army to march North, Dany, along with Jaime and Cersei, fly North on the backs of their dragons.

Meanwhile, in Valyria, while clinging to his last remaining brain cell, Jorah finds the cure for Greyscale amidst the ruins of their once-great civilization. He returns to Volantis and hears from prostitute-Dany that actual-Dany is heading to the Wall. Jorah gets on his horse, then a boat, then a horse again to follow suit.

At the Wall, Petyr gives his troops to Dany in exchange for him being named her heir since she has no children. On the other side, Jon Snow has been brought back from the dead as a white walker and leads the army of the undead.

Meanwhile, in Oldtown, Sam discovers something about the origins of the white walkers. They, like the dragons, are tied to the strength of magic in the world. The magic of the dragons is what re-awakened them from their unholy slumber so perhaps the end of the dragons will return them to bed. Sam returns to the Wall but finds Jon is no longer Lord Commander. Instead, newly elected 1000th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jorah Mormont is waiting.

Jorah pleads his case to the three heads begging them to kill the dragons to end the war. Dany refuses and gives Jorah a dirty look.
***
##A Savior (or 3) Rises
***
The battle commences with Jon's army of White Walkers and wights on one side and Dany's army of the Knights of the Vale, the Knights of the North, and wildlings on the other side.

During the fight, Jaime and Cersei are killed and die in each others arms. Not wanting to see any further carnage, Jorah drives his father's sword into Dany's heart, killing her as she gazes into his eyes. If only you had chosen me over Dario, he utters, making him the saddest hero ever, in more ways than one. He has fulfilled his destiny as Azor Ahai.

The war is not over yet, as new King Petyr Baelish still has to deal with a now very upset dragon and still very upset army of undead monsters. Luckily, Bran Stark has finally gained the ability to warg into Drogon, and sacrifices himself by letting the men kill Drogon, pleasing the White Walkers. King of the White Walkers Jon Snow negotiates a peace with Azor Ahai reborn and 1000th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jorah Mormont. Jon says the White Walkers will remain north of the wall in peace and says there will be no more winters, only summer, so long as the realm of man holds their promise of a peaceful, dragon-free world. He is the Prince that was Promised, the one prophesied to bring an end to the darkness.

Finally, King Baelish and his army of Northerners and Wildlings heads south so Baelish can finally attain his dream of sitting on the throne. However, along the way, he runs into the army of Dothraki and Unsullied led by Tyrion Lannister. The armies fight, with Tyrion winning. Baelish is captured and Varys chops off his balls just to get the last laugh in. Also that would totally be Sansa's luck that her husband becomes a eunuch. Tyrion returns South and sits on the Iron Throne in triumph. There is peace throughout Westeros and Essos and he is in control of an army consisting of Dothraki, Unsullied, and Westerosi knights. He is the son of a powerful Dothraki Khal and a legendary Westerosi Queen, and unites Westeros and Essos under one banner. He is the Stallion that just Mounted the World.",11,2,False,self,,,,,

Her actions such as constantly fighting the traditions of the Free Cities and beheading the slave that kills the Son of the Harpy in public are bad enough, but what's worse is that she seems to genuinely expects, not unlike Viserys, that everyone will accept and agree with her decisions, no matter how bad, because ""I am the rightful ruler"", which is a stretch when it comes to ruling in Slaver's Bay to boot. 

Despite the fact that she is the Mother of Dragons, and that Westeros is in chaos, it's incredibly hard to root for her as ruler as she looks to be another Aerys in the making. This last part is particularly pertinent, as even if it's GRRM/D&amp;D's intention to show her in this light, it's astounding that men like Barristan Selmy, who often regrets aiding Aerys in the Defiance of Duskendale, and Jorah, who lived in a Westeros governed by the Mad King, continue to blindly follow her. 

How GRRM plans to justify this is beyond me, but perhaps interpretive book readers can provide a reasonable explanation, why is Dany, when you think about it, able to gain so much respect?",29,16,False,self,,,,,

He got Lysa to kill Arryn and to send the letter. He got Sansa to defend him in front of the interrogation at the Vale after pushing Lysa out the moon door. He got Sansa to agree to marry the son of the man who stabbed her brother and sacked her home, a rapist and a sadist.

I think it would be interesting to see how the main POV characters, who went through their different journies meet up in some way. Especially since most of the main POV characters in the books are stark kids + theon, who all started out together, and then got separated. Would be cool to have them reunite after so long, makes their character development arcs come to close. 

Here's how I view it: 

- Jon will be revived by mel, is proclaimed as Azor Ahai, him and mel go to see bran and the three eyed raven
- Davos sees the defense of the Nights watch at castle black, but the nights king uses that horn to blow the wall down and kill everyone in the watch
- As the whitewalkers finally push on, bran and jon are forced to flee south. There they meet sansa and theon, then take a refugee ship to Braavos, where they meet Arya
- The stark kids then sail to Meeren
- Jaime and Bronn are sent to Meeren on the dornish ship they thought was going to Kings landing
- Dany is saved by Jorah and Daario, everyone meets up in Mereen to plan how to deal with the whitewalkers
- In kings landing, cersei dies from a failed trial by combat, hound kills zombie mountain
- Tommen and the Tyrells die as well, leads to the faith militant in charge of the city, until white walkers invade and ruin it

Remember the good ol' days when your favorite characters were still alive?  Go back and watch old episodes with the benefit of hindsight!  How have the events of the latest season been shaped by the decisions of characters earlier on?  Catch foreshadowing that you missed the first time you watched.  The latest season is finished, so start over from the beginning and look at past episodes with a fresh perspective.

##1.03 - ""Lord Snow""

* Directed By: Brian Kirk
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 1, 2011

Ned joins the King's Small Council at King's Landing, capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and learns just how poorly Westeros is being managed. Catelyn decides to go covertly to the south to warn her husband, but is intercepted by an old friend, Councillor Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish. Brandon learns he will never walk again. He does not remember that Jaime Lannister pushed him out of a tower, saying instead that he fell. Jon struggles to adapt to life on the Wall, as he trains with a number of low-born recruits who are not impressed by his bloodline. Tyrion, also visiting the Wall, is beseeched by the Watch Commander Lord Mormont to plead the King and Queen to send more men to join the Night's Watch, for powerful enemies are massing beyond the Wall. Daenerys, now possessing no small measure of control as Drogo's ""Khaleesi"", begins to stand up to Viserys.

---

##1.04 - ""Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things""

* Directed By: Brian Kirk
* Written By: Bryan Cogman
* Originally Aired: May 8, 2011

Tyrion reaches out to Bran with a way for the boy to reclaim his mobility. Ned searches for clues to the unexplained death of Jon Arryn (the former King's Hand), and in the process uncovers King Robert's illegitimate son. Robert and his guests witness a tournament honoring Ned. Jon takes measures to protect Samwell Tarly, an awkward and friendless boy, from the abuse of the Night's Watchmen; a frustrated Viserys clashes with his newly empowered sister; Sansa dreams of life as a queen, while Arya envisions a far different future. Catelyn rallies her father's allies and has Tyrion arrested for conspiring to murder her son.

Sure, it was a huge honor for Jaime to be chosen at a young age. But in the culture of the story, it seems like a great house would not be expected to sacrifice the chance to have their name carried to the next generation. So, I don't think the king asking for him would count as a ""good"" reason. (Obviously, Tyrion could carry on the name, but none of his family seems to see him in this role).

The Lord of Light is powerful, giver of warmth, protector of the day, and only sometimes asks that you burn children to death. R'hllor gives power to it's most faithful of followers, a sword that could slay the dead or even the the ability to come back to life, although everything has a cost. The Lord of Light is not alone however, for he opposes the Great Other, a being whose name can never be spoken. The Great Other is the darkness, the cold, whose followers forgot their humanity long ago.

Two equal gods, forever in conflict over the Dawn. Yet, the religion of the Light is not the only such religion in Westeros.

The Iron do not believe in the Lord of Light, the Seven, or Old Gods, but [of the Drowned God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhFaboTQxvQ). The Drowned God raised the Iron Born the sea, to sack and carve their names into song. The Drowned God fights an eternal war with the Storm. The Iron Born's God is dead, but *What is Dead May Never Die*.

So, in both religions you have a God associated with light and the heavens, and another with death and darkness (also the Great Other and Drowned God takes ques from the works of Lovecrafts, with unspeakable names or generally Cthullu like appearance). My theory is this, these pairs of god, the Lord of Light/the Storm God, and the Greater Other/The Drowned God, are the same god, as seen through thousands of years of different cultural perspectives.

The Ironborn are descended from the First Men but, as the lore video I posted stated, they already had an organized religion before the Andals came to Westeros. It isn't at all related to the religion held by the Children of the Forest and the other first men. Where did this religion come from then? I believe, it somehow came from the White Walkers.

While it's only implied in the second lore video I posted, it is outright stated in the books that the White Walkers follow the Great Other. They are normally called ""the Others"" in the books, after all (this was changed in the show just to avoid general confusion in the audience). We only have scant few reliable details about what happened in the first War for the Dawn, so it might be possible that the White Walkers were not as complete in their cleansing of all life.

A more likely scenario, is that the White Walkers were at one point men, who believed in the Great Other. Some split in the tribe happened, some believers went North to their Lord's call, and were turned into the first White Walkers, while the rest stayed on the Iron Islands. Even after the White Walkers were pushed back, the Iron Island retained their religion, but it began to change. The Great Other's real name was lost, it was called a god of death or the dead god, or some variation of that.

Since drowning is a really common way to die, the terms ""Dead God"" and ""Drowned God"" became one in the same. Their great enemy stopped being the light from the sky, but the storms from the Heavens that wrecked the Iron Born's ships. Instead of being called North, too the palace temple of Ice to *literally* die and be reborn, the Iron Born were being called to the Drowned Gods watery hall, and *figuratively* die in the drowning to be reborn stronger. Old beliefs that the Great Other wanted everything dead transformed into more useful beliefs that the Drowned God wanted the Iron Born to sack and burn what they please.

This isn't to actually suggest that the Iron Born or the White Walkers have the ""correct"" beliefs, or if they just have the same religious roots that explain the magical nature of the world, or that the Many Faced Man isn't correct that these are all just different faces of the same Many Faced God who gives only one gift. 

Tl:Dr: The Drowned God and the Great Other are the same god, or the same supernatural force believed to be a god, just from different cultural lenses.",1,5,False,self,,,,,

So we have all seen many a post and theory about how the Game of Thrones series will end, who will live, who will die, etc. All great stuff- and a ton of fun theorizing whats going to happen in arguably the best fantasy story of our time.

I have been looking back at what we've seen so far, to try to get an idea of what the main story GRRM is trying to tell. I mean of course that he is telling us the story of Dany, Jon Snow, Bran, Stannis, etc- but what exactly is the whole point?  Writers tell a story for a reason, and I think I finally have pegged GRRM's reason.

We know part of GRRM's reasoning is that the stereotypical good guy/ bad guy does not really exist. In fact, it is a part of fantasy that is actually unbelievable to some. I can buy dragons and magic in the story because we are in the fictional land of Westeros- but I can't believe or buy into a mortal human being 100% good or 100% bad.

So what else is there? 

I think GRRM's main idea is, plainly put, that everyone will get what they deserve.

Now wait- you're probably thinking ""WUT? LOL Ned didn't deserve to get beheaded- he was being honorable!"" or ""What did Sansa do to deserve being raped?""

What I mean is that GRRM writes this story with the idea that people will get what they logically sow (as in you reap what you sow). Ned is honorable to a fault- and it is what gets him killed. Sansa is naive so of course the world will figuratively (and Ramsay literally) rape her. Joffrey was a huge prick, so of course he would die the least honorable way possible- poison at his wedding feast.

So that is why I think GRRM writes these characters' fates the way he does; he is establishing that yeah, there are dragons and magic and fantasy, but these are still ""real"" people in a ""real"" world. They create their own fate.

Along these lines- we can theorize even more about the eventual fate of Ramsay for instance- he's done a ton of bad shit and I predict a very gruesome (satisfying for readers/viewers) death. I wouldn't bet on any main character actually carrying out this sentence- but I would definitely expect some sort of White Walker or Dragon attack essentially ripping him to shreds.

Stannis was dutiful, faithful and loyal to a fault. He followed the advice of a priestess over his seasoned Hand of the King Davos. Of course the priestess will actually abandon Stannis and he will die. His faith should have been tempered with skepticism. 

Jon Snow is an interesting character in that he is almost as honorable as Ned was- which got Ned killed. However we have seen Jon break his nightwatch vows in order to be with Ygritte. I think his current ""death"" is part of the lesson- of course you'd be stabbed by NW men if you are betraying their ideals. On the other hand Jon new he was being careless- whereas Ned was almost unaware of his fault. So perhaps Jon Snow will get to live- having learned the final lesson as a boy (kill the boy) he is ready to become a man and hopefully with the right knowledge to survive.

TL;DR: GRRM writes GoT with the idea that every character will reap what they sow. Ramsay is going to get himself torn apart for the shit he's done. Stannis, Ned, Jon, Sansa all got what they set in motion.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

R. Martin's novel.  
I know the show already is different from the books as far as a few characters, places and whatnot go, but the main story is still the same, and I believe this will no longer be the case.  
As we all know a new season of [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) comes every year, while [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)'s books have no set date, and come out roughly every 2-6 years. (The latest, [A Dance with Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons), came out in 2011)  
For this very reason, even if GRRM decides to publish the upcoming book, [""The Winds of Winter""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter) before Season 6 comes along, I'm pretty sure he wont do the same for Season 7 and ""A Dream of Spring"", given his publishing schedule.  
On top of that, the show is based ON the books, so there is no way D&amp;D can make the 7th season (and 6th if ""The Winds of Winter"" doesn't come out before it airs) to be just like the book, although [it is known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foqUPiwMiOM) that GRRM has the whole main plot in his mind, and D&amp;D know it, if something is to happen to George.  
Season 5 was the one to differ from the books the most, and I don't think this was ""just because"", in fact, I think the changes between Season 5 and [A Dance with Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons) are the point when the road splits into two.  
I know this isn't much of a theory, more like a prediction for the future of the books and the show.  
**TL;DR:** The last two books and last two seasons of Game of Thrones will be very different.

We all know that the Stark's are famous for being able to warg - I was just curious if this maybe has any significance to Arya's being blind now. 

If she can't see with her own eyes, maybe she's 'forced' to warg into Nymeria? 

Or is that a lost cause and is this a stupid idea? I've not finished reading the books yet so I don't know if maybe Nymeria is gone for good or if she's dead and in the show I don't recall her resurfacing in any way.

I've come to the part where Tyrion's Night's Watch escorts are having dinner at Winterfell with Robb (acting Lord while his parents are away) and Bran. They are discussing Benjen's absence and Bran says ""the Children will help him!"" He remembered Old Nan's stories of the Children.

The idea is immediately dismissed as everyone believes the Children are long gone. However, we all know now that they are very much still in existence. We also know that the Stark's have the blood of the First Men and keep the Old Gods just like the Children. 

I don't really have much evidence or anything but it just feels right. I could see him coming back this season with Bran's storyline. Perhaps someone with more knowledge of the lore and further reading than myself can help support my claim, or if evidence exists, help disprove.

Looking forward to a healthy discussion on the topic. It could be very interesting if he is indeed with them. ",19,4,False,self,,,,,

In Season 1 /AGOT Daenerys succeeds and it is mostly believed to be influenced by blood magic (sacrificing mirri maz duur etc.). But there is something I noticed when (re) watching Season 1 that might have helped.

Multiple times we see the dragon eggs surrounded by candles and Daenerys even hearing ""dragons"" while they are still not hatched. And from other sources we know that Dragons needed Vulcanos to hatch, both in Asshai and in old Valyria. 

So what I suggest is that dragon eggs need heat in order to develop and finally hatch. After all dragons used to be born in the wild, and there is no possibility for blood magic being at work there. Perhaps the reason for the eggs hatching was not solely the magic event that unfolded in Season 1 but also their long time exposure to heat. This could also explain while other attempts failed. Maybe that had the right components for initating birth (magic/fire) but not the right components for egg development (heat exposure). ",7,0,False,self,,,,,

Last scene of the episode, the wildlings are debating on how to execute the traitors. Wun Wun wants to grind their bones to make his bread, generic Thenn chief with battle ax says they can keep their glass, but still wants to eat crow (especially that little shit Olly). Tormund favors throwing them from the top of the wall, while in the meantime Davos is trying to convince them to spare them.

""The army of the dead is coming,"" he says ""and we need every man we can get to defend the wall, traitors or not. If we kill them, we have 10 less men to guard the wall and every life counts.""

No sooner has Davos finished speaking than the main gate to Castle Black opens, a solitary figure enters through the threshold. No one can discern the figure's identity due to the blinding flames emanating from his drawn sword. The figure then utters a single word in a deep growl,

""Fewer.""

So well let's take a look at the scene. Cersei gets undressed, has to walk trough a group of people then more and more people start yelling ""Shame, Shame, Shame"", well you guys get it. The people yelling shame fits in the story on itself but I think there is more to it. GoT has always got some critics (positive and negative) on the nudity and sex it contains and I am pretty sure some people enjoy themselves with this material. Now I am also sure there were people who really liked ""The Shame scene"" and got it going. Now while the scene started there wasn't anyone who yelled ""Shame"" yet, and as the viewer got it going and maybe almost reached the end, the yelling came up.

In the books though, I did notice that Arya kept getting wolf dreams through Nymeria's eyes. Jon Snow had the incident where he found the Free Folk army. I even recall mention of Sansa having a wolf dream despite Lady being dead.  There might have been similar hints for Robb + Greywind and Rickon + Shaggydog, but they likely slipped me by.
In any case, I just reached the start of A Dance with Dragons and Varamyr Six-Skins explicitly stated in his chapter that Jon Snow was an untrained Warg.


So the question I'm posing is this : Is it supposed to be quite well established that all the children of Eddard Stark were born with ""the gift"" (i.e. they're skinchangers) despite it not being explicitly stated for most of them? 

And for that matter, what about the Green Dreams? Was only Bran getting those or did I miss some other references I should have been getting?

I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.""

So, their watch ends at death. Technically, if Jon Snow gets brought back to life after the events of A Dance With Dragons/Season Five Finale, he will have died (albeit not permanently) and therefore be allieved of his Night's watch vows. Maybe this is GRR Martin's way of setting Jon up to take crowns and win glory without becoming an Oathbreaker. I, personally, would much prefer King Jon to early-grave Jon. What do you guys think?

Because they're dickheads from Asshole island!

* Vicky's a strange, angst-ridden, grim, badass dumbfuck, with no fear of death. He's also unintentionally hilarious at times, when he's cursing at monkeys, proclaiming to sail the dothraki sea, 'freeing' slaves by making them thralls instead and burning beautiful women imagining them to be in ecstasy instead of agony. He has a lot of respect for his adversaries and actually has a shred of decency by ironborn standards. Plus, he has a fucking smoking red rahloo hand of doom!

* Euron is a menacing &amp; sinister yet charismatic villain who cuts the tongues off his thralls and has allegedly sailed though Valyria. He has connections to Bloodraven through his dreams. He's over-the-top and  eeeeeevvvil but I can't help but love every chapter he's in since he's so unpredictable and scary. I feel he will affect the end-game in a big way.

* Asha is my homegurl. Sexy, sassy, badass, fearless warrior woman. She's kinda dickish at times but still very smart and empathetic. I love the chapters where she talks shit to Euron's mongrels, and I really enjoyed her Stannis-camera chapters too especially her interactions with Mormont, Suggs &amp; Massey, which really paint her as an intelligent and perceptive person.

* Aeron. Boring as fuck. The only guy I couldn't stand. Mayhaps I'll appreciate him more in TWOW when he raises Chthulhu from the sea or some crazy shit. The only good part about him was the Golden Storm story.

* Special props to my main man, Rodrik 'The Reader' Harlaw. Calm as ice, balls of steel, thirsty for knowledge, more intelligent than all the other iron-born combined, looked down upon by others for his perverse, unmanly habit of *gasp* reading books.

However, on the off chance that he survives, do you think he will become king? I ask this for a couple reasons. 

Melisandre tells Stannis he will betray his men, his family, and all he holds dear, but he will become king in S2E10. So far, she is right about his betrayals, but not yet about him becoming king.

[Casting Spoilers S6] We also know that Cleganebowl has a decent chance of happening based on casting descriptions for S6, meaning Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane is still alive and has adopted a life of service and solitude, and may be called on to fight his brother Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane, who is currently a zombified being reanimated by Qyburn. I imagine S6 beginning with Cersei exacting revenge with the use of The Mountain, but eventually having to answer the question of her incestuous relations with Jaime in her upcoming trial, and to prove that her children (in this case, Tommen) are the legitimate sons of Robert Baratheon. Naturally, Cersei may choose trial by combat and select The Mountain as her representative. If she does, and The Hound is chosen to represent the Sparrows, defeats his older brother, and rules that Tommen is illegitimate...

Well then where would that leave us? Robert would have no legitimate children, and his brother next in line (Stannis) would take the throne, making Melisandre's prediction ultimately correct. Now obviously the Sparrows would be hard-pressed to allow Stannis, a heretic, to become king. But what if Stannis simply ""betrays"" his own religion and renounces the Lord of Light? He ""betrays what he holds dear"", as in his own faith. Although I acknowledge Stannis is not a very devout believer.

Only two survive, Ned and Howland Reed. After the fight and hearing his sister call out for him, Ned runs up the tower to find his sister lying in a pool of her own blood. He's too late to save her but suddenly he hears a faint cry from under the covers. He lifts up the covers to see a beautiful baby. He begins to tear up as he wraps the boy with the bloody sheets. It fades to black.

INTRO

Two silhouettes of men on horses ride as the sun rises over the land. It is Jorah and Daario. They have been searching for weeks and still haven't found anything remotely related to where Khaleesi's location is. Daario begins to boast about what he will do when he finds her as Jorah sees something reflect the sun on the ground. It is her ring.

Jaime's ship is terribly silent. The crew hears Jaime's cries from his room. They look to Bronn. ""Do I have to do everything around here?"" he mutters as he walks down the ships steps to Jaime's quarters. He tries his best to emotionally connect to a grieving father. He tells the story of his own father who ruthlessly beat him when he was a boy. While it doesn't help that much, his point is that Jaime should be proud that at he was always there for his daughter. Jaime's silence is sharp as he raises his head and demands for the head of Ellaria. 

Snow covers the hill on the side of one of Winterfell's wall. Sansa awakens slowly and is incredible pain. She is picked up by a figure she can't figure out. It is Brienne of Tarth. As Sansa looks back to where she is picked up, she sees Theon's body badly crippled as Podrick takes care of his body. She awakes that night to Podrick cooking a meal for the three. Brienne tells of Stannis' defeat. Sansa, noticeably still shaken up from the fall, asks where Theon is. Brienne looks at Podrick. She then tells Sansa that his body had inevitably cushioned her fall, and that he did not survive. Sansa once again is sad.

Arya cleans a body as Jaqen watches over. She feels the body's face, and most importantly, it's eyes. She begins to weep as Jaqen describes what has happened to her. She is currently blinded by her rage and can only be reversed if she is found as a true faceless man, and that is only completed by fulfilling the list of men she was ordered to assassinate. 

When visiting, King's Landing deals with the trial of Margaery and Loras Tyrell's trial. Loras is found guilty, yet Margaery is given a choice to skip the trial from the High Sparrow, who reveals himself to her as Howland Reed. She is strongly interested.

Tyrion and the Spider look over Meereen. Tyrion is excited to rule as he enjoys the art of it, but is nervous that he will turn into a ruthless ruler like his father was. He begs the question, are children doomed to their parent's fate? Spider remains silent.

Ramsey over looks the battlefield grinning at all of the dead bodies. Until he hears one of his men call him over. He asks why until he sees who the man is standing over. A barely alive Stannis. ""Perfect."" Ramsey mutters to himself as he orders the arrest of the rightful king.

Castle Black is grim and colder than usual. The Night's Watch go on about their business as they all know what had happened the night before but do not want to come to the realization that they were the cause of it. Melisandre looks over a body with a cover over it. Alliser Thorne walks into the room and acts disgusted. He can't believe that one of the Wildlings would murder the person who saved them. She finds the irony in his statement as she states that the God of Light has a plan and the people who caused this death will pay. Thorne walks out of the room. Once he leaves the room, Melisandre pulls up the covers and reveals Jon Snow's body. She strokes his black hair and whispers in his ear, ""Awake Jon Stark."" That night, the Night's Watch gathers around the pyre for Jon. Thorne says to the group of people that justice will be served and that the Wildling who caused this will be put to death. The pyre begins. Jon Snow's body is engulfed in flames as Melisandre looks upon his body through the flames. Ghost, on a leash, begins to howl. Olly cries out, ""Look!"" Jon's fingers begin to move amongst the flames. Melisandre smiles and bows. Jon Stark awakes from the fire as Ghost continues to howl. 

BLACK
CREDITS

I really like the idea of ""fatherhood"" being prevalent in the opener and through out the season with dealing with Jaime, Tyrion, and Jon. Jaime, in the sense of now that he is a proud and open father, he can't be as selfish in his actions and his ways. This will mature his character greatly. Tyrion, in the sense that now he holds the ultimate title in a land, a title that his father would have never guessed his son would ever bear. Will he be good ruler because of his blood or in spite of his father? And most importantly, Jon Stark, and his journey to find out his origin, and what will soon be revealed as who his true father is.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this! I love GOT and spent all day organizing this idea.

We had opposite schedules and I was attending university classes in my small amount of free time. I got really into GoT because it was an easy way for me to chill out before trying to go to bed at 8am and gave me a sort of routine. I got home from work, got comfortable, made a small meal, and watched one episode. At this time, everyone else in the world seemed to be caught up to the current season (four) whereas I was starting from the beginning.

My wife was running late and came through the living room where I was having dinner for breakfast and she saw the baby in the brothel scene. At this point, she had lost all interest in ever watching the show. It's hard to blame her, despite my telling her it was so much more than that.

Then, about a two weeks or so later, I see she's going into work a little later and I invite her to watch the remainder of the episode. After all, I thought this one would be better for her and her softer heart. After all, it was a wedding... Yep. That wedding. Not only was I shocked in my own right, but now I'm looking back and forth between the horror on the screen and her shocked face, which is probably trying to comprehend, among other things, how someone can watch this many seasons of this kind of violence.
 
She's now completely done. A baby slaughtered in front of its mom, a pregnant lady getting shanked, a ladies throat slit and spraying everywhere... She's done. Sir R.R. &amp; Co. even managed to ruin her appetite for the day. 

Fast forward about two weeks ago and one of her friends (and a great one at that) convinces her to give it another try. Was it Rob's dreamy eyes? All the pretty dresses from Highgarden? I don't know and I don't care because that friend created a monster. Now, she is rushing home from work, getting out of her work clothes, opening two beers, and cueing up right where we left off. And I love going back and reaching everything.

Today, she's hanging out with a couple gf's and one of the girls cousins (a dude). She starts talking about how she just started season three and how much she's loving it. They are all caught up and they say, ""Oh wasn't it awesome how they poisoned Joffrey?"" ""Can someone just kill Cersei already? If anyone should've died by season five, it's her."" ""Can you believe Jon Snow died? And where is Hodor and Brand?""

We've been binge-watching these episodes so fast, we have been eating our pantry empty and finding ways to cool with what random ingredients we still have. We fall asleep watching the episodes, even laying out blankets on the floor and pretending to ""camp out."" And these f-ers took all the wind out of her sails. She was devasted. They said tried to make amends by saying she should know basically everyone is gonna die. ""I mean, come on. It's Game of Thrones. What'd you expect?""

Thanks to those that aren't assholes and don't suck the fun out of it for others. It's people like them that make bad examples of fans.

Also I see it unlikely that they will stay there forever, whereas Jon would always stay there.

Before that, house Tyrell and Lannister had a power struggle over which family could marry with Sansa, which ended with the Lannisters winning. In the books, the Boltons basically falsified a poor outsider as a Stark and got Ramsay to marry her, in order to lay claim to Winterfell. I want to discuss whether this is really similar to European history. I understand that once ancient royal families who have lost their power are seen as rightful rulers, BUT ONLY by the people who oppose the current rulers. It would seem utterly ridiculous for the very people who deposed the old rulers to then recognize or promote the idea that they are still rightful rulers. For example, when the European allies defeated Napoleon, they exiled him to distant island so he would no longer have any influence in France. They didn't get a French aristocrat to marry a relative of the Bonaparte family so he could rule over France. What I'm trying to say is, it just seems weird that King Joffrey, along with House Lannister accused Ned Stark of treason, and then killed off most of the Stark family and their allies for their rebellion, in the end still recognizes Sansa Stark as the rightful heir to Winterfell. Wouldn't it be a better idea to just block all future influence of the Stark name, and confiscate all their property? Like when Robert defeated the Targaryens, he didn't try to secure the throne through marraige with a Targaryen either. Tell me what you think!",10,1,False,self,,,,,

She seemed like such a bad ass in the previous seasons and had a lot of power so it just seemed weird to me how she allowed them to take over the city and run amok , and then they eventually turned on her.

Season Six Casting and filming locations spoilers!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3decp5/all_spoilers_everything_huge_fan_theory_revealed/,CourtsideCorey,1436978550,"I know variations of this ""news"" that is now a couple weeks old have been posted, but I wanted to give a couple quick thoughts on the casting and filming locations released.

&amp;nbsp;

(It concerns a certain someone's parents.)

&amp;nbsp;

So first off, this is pure speculation, but it is based off of some pretty big clues. Casting calls released for next season, and while none of the characters are named, their descriptions can give us pretty big hints at their identities. Coupled with announced filming locations, it looks like the biggest fan theory of all time might get some screen time next season.

&amp;nbsp;

First, one of the characters for next season is  described in a casting call as ""a legendary warrior, the epitome of knighthood, and a knight who carries a famous sword."" This character has only been briefly mentioned on the show, but that description appears to match pretty closely to one Ser Arthur Dayne, aka The Sword of the Morning. Dayne is repeatedly referred to in the books as the finest and most deadliest warrior in all the Seven Kingdoms, even by such notable warriors as Ned Stark and Jaime Lannister. Dayne carried a greatsword named Dawn, that was forged from a fallen star, and was a member of the Kingsguard during Robert's Rebellion. Dayne met his demise at the hands of Ned Stark and his companions at the end of the Rebellion, at a place called, The Tower of Joy. 

&amp;nbsp;

That brings us to our next clue; it was announced that GOT will be filming here:

&amp;nbsp;

https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castillo_de_Zafra_(Guadalajara)

&amp;nbsp;

Based off the images, and description of The Tower of Joy in the books, it seems HIGHLY likely that this will be the real life stand in for the Tower of Joy. The Tower is always described as a lone tower, sitting atop a rocky hill. When you put the two pieces of information together, a casting call for an Arthur Dayne character, and a filming location that matches the Tower of Joy (TOJ) it looks like we will be seeing in a flashback the scene in which Ned Stark attempts to rescue his sister Lyanna at the end of Robert's Rebellion that occurs in Book One. This is important because it is also the place where most readers believe Ned found Jon Snow, and promised his sister Ned would raise the child as his bastard son, as opposed to revealing his true heritage as heir to the Iron Throne.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the evidence against this is also there if you want to look for it. The filming site could also be a stand in for Casterly Rock, although that castle is described as being near the sea in the books. It's also important to note, that in the books, the flashback scene occurs in a dream while Ned is under the influence of Milk of the Poppy, and at this point in the show Ned is Dead. So they will have to get creative with how they show the scene, but they could simply drop it as a flashback like they did in Season Five with the Cersei Prophecy. 

&amp;nbsp;

We would theoretically also see Ned Stark again, and also get our first glimpse of the elusive Howland Reed. If there is any truth to the Howland Reed = The High Sparrow theories, we could get confirmation on that as well.

&amp;nbsp;

So looks like some pretty big reveals next season concerning Jon Snow. That's a lot of time spent on a character that is supposed to be dead don't you think?

&amp;nbsp;

P.S. If you want more casting news, shoot me an IM. You can guess the basic outline of next season based off some off the casting news.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

He's too late to save her but suddenly he hears a faint cry from under the covers. He lifts up the covers to see a beautiful baby. He begins to tear up as he wraps the boy with the bloody sheets. It fades to black.

INTRO

Two silhouettes of men on horses ride as the sun rises over the land. It is Jorah and Daario. They have been searching for weeks and still haven't found anything remotely related to where Khaleesi's location is. Daario begins to boast about what he will do when he finds her as Jorah sees something reflect the sun on the ground. It is her ring.

Jaime's ship is terribly silent. The crew hears Jaime's cries from his room. They look to Bronn. ""Do I have to do everything around here?"" he mutters as he walks down the ships steps to Jaime's quarters. He tries his best to emotionally connect to a grieving father. He tells the story of his own father who ruthlessly beat him when he was a boy. While it doesn't help much, his point is that Jaime should be proud that at he always treated his daughter with respect. Jaime's momentary silence ends as he raises his head and demands for Ellarias death.
Snow covers the hill on the side of one of Winterfell's wall. Sansa awakens slowly and is in incredible pain. She is picked up by a figure she can't figure out. It is Brienne of Tarth. As Sansa looks back to where she is picked up, she sees Theon's body badly crippled as Podrick drags him out her sight. She awakes that night to Podrick cooking a meal for the three. Brienne tells of Stannis' defeat. Sansa, noticeably still shaken up from the fall, asks where Theon is. Brienne looks at Podrick. She then tells Sansa that his body was found under hers and thus had inevitably cushioned her fall, and that he did not survive. Sansa is once again sad.

Arya cleans a body as Jaqen watches over. She feels the body's face with her hands, and most importantly, it's eyes. She begins to weep as Jaqen describes what has happened to her. She is currently blinded by her rage and can only be cured if she is found as a true faceless man, and that is only completed by fulfilling the list of men she was ordered to assassinate.

King's Landing deals with the beginnings of Margaery and Loras Tyrell's trial. Margaery is given a choice to skip the trial from the High Sparrow, who reveals himself to her as Howland Reed. She is strongly interested.
Tyrion and the Spider look over Meereen. Tyrion is excited to rule as he enjoys the art of it, but is nervous that he will turn into a ruthless ruler like his father was. He begs the question, are children doomed to their parent's fate? Spider remains silent.

Ramsey over looks the battlefield grinning at all of the dead bodies. Where is he? he screams. He then hears one of his men call him over. A barely alive Stannis resting his head on a sword thrusted into the trunk of the tree sits in front of his eyes. ""Perfect,"" Ramsey mutters to himself as he orders the arrest of the rightful king.

Castle Black is grim and colder than usual. The Night's Watch go on about their business as they all know what had happened the night before but do not want to come to the realization that they were the cause of it. Melisandre looks over a body with a cover over it. Alliser Thorne walks into the room and curses the Wildlings for the murder. She states that the God of Light has a plan and the people who caused this death will pay. Thorne walks out of the room. Once he leaves the room, Melisandre pulls up the covers to reveal Jon Snow's face. She strokes his black hair and whispers in his ear, ""Awake Jon Stark."" That night, the Night's Watch gathers around the pyre for Jon. Thorne announces to the group of people that justice will be served and that the Wildling who caused this will be put to death. The pyre begins. Jon Snow's body is engulfed in flames as Melisandre looks upon his body through the flames. Ghost, on a leash, begins to howl. Olly cries out, ""Look!"" Jon's fingers begin to move amongst the flames. Melisandre smiles and bows. Jon Stark awakes from the fire as Ghost continues to howl.

CREDITS

I really like the idea of ""fatherhood"" being prevalent in the opener and through out the season with dealing with Jaime, Tyrion, and Jon. Jaime, in the sense of now that he is a proud and open father, he can't be as selfish in his actions and his ways. This will mature his character greatly. Tyrion, in the sense that now he holds the ultimate title in a land, a title that his father would have never guessed his son would ever bear. Will he be good ruler because of his blood or in spite of his father? And most importantly, Jon Stark, and his journey to find out his origin, and what will soon be revealed as who his true father is.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this! I love GOT and spent all day organizing this idea.

I have an interesting theory relating to ASOIAF. I've heard the whole R+L=J theory making Jon Snow Daenerys' nephew but I feel like it's too simple and as fans it's our duty to get more complex with our theories.

Daenerys and Khal Drogo's son Rhaego was a stillborn and we were told the life was essentially traded for Khal Drogo's. Perhaps Mirri Maz Duur used her blood magic and either screwed up royally or intentionally sent the baby back in time to it's ancestor, Rhaegar Targaryen. Rhaegar raises it, probably with Lyanna until Ned finds it assuming it's Rhaegar and Lyanna's child and brings it home with him (a la R+L=J).

Yes, that's right. Jon Snow is a bonafide non-bastard Targaryen/Drogo crossbreed.
It explains his dark hair and eyes and his naturally hardcore talent with blades.
It's also mentioned somewhere he hates getting his hair cut which reminded me of the Dothraki not cutting their hair unless defeated (actually what started me on this theory).

Another thing that came to mind but doesn't necessarily support this theory is that his death which I believe is real, will be soon reversed. I do believe that it was he who died, not another Mance Rayder enchanted ruby situation. While reading the oath the first two lines stood out:

""Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.""

I believe that Jon had to be killed to be able to leave the wall without perverting his honour. In that way his death is kind of pivotal to move his character forward.

Now there are obvious flaws with my new D+K=J theory, the first being Jon having Stark features. Children of winter, let me know what you think.

TL;DR Khal Drogo and Daenerys child Rhaego transported back in time and is raised as Jon Snow. ",8,0,False,self,,,,,

I played most of the first episode of Telltale's game and it was kinda interesting though I didn't really understand what the hell was going on. Some guys died, some guy I was playing as got banished then I was another kid who was lord but playing hide and seek or something, I dunno. I stopped then mostly to sleep but also because it shifted to some girl and I totally lost track. 
I also sorta know some spoilers (aforementioned friend would tell me so I could tell our other GoT friends so he wouldn't look like the asshat), like apparently some people screw against a bastard kid king's coffin and we never got to see Jon Snow's penis.

Im just going to list off multiple characters and what I think their roles will be and what they will do in season 6. I also have TL;DR for each character so you dont have to read all my gibberish if you dont want to. Also, sorry for any misspellings or grammar issues. I dont have enough time to check everything.


Petyr Baelish: Currently, Baelish is sided with the Tyrells and he has played Cersei in such a way (by giving her Oliver for Loras trial) that she thinks he is with the Lannisters. Baelish pledged to Cersei that he will destroy whoever wins the Battle of Winterfell as they are healing from their wounds. He also works with Olenna to have Cersei thrown in prison and then put on trial. At this point, he is exactly where he wants to be. If he defeats whoever holds Winterfell at the end of the battle (Boltons) he will become the Warden of the North, but he needs Sansa to hold this position, which as we know will be a problem since she has escaped. If he succeeds in this then he would basically be Warden of the North and East.

TL;DR: Will fight Winterfell to become Warden of the North. Would be Warden of the North and basically Warden of the East. 



Doran Martell: I have heard that some people believe that he was secretly working with Elia to kill Myrcella, which I think is completely false. He expresses multiple times that he does not want war and he sends Trystane to KL to serve on the council so it wouldnt make sense if he wanted to kill Myrcella. Dorne is a very mysterious place that we know little about as viewers because weve only had one season there. Dorne as a whole will become more important in the plot as it furthers, so I expect some major power plays coming from Doran soon. Its all part of the Dorne Master Plan. (Google this theory. VERY cool)

TL;DR: Dorne will be making some major political moves soon.


Cersei: Cersei will be put on trial next season. She confessed to sleeping with Lancel outside of her marriage, but she denied that she had a part in Roberts death and having sex with Jaime to produce her three children. Of course, all of this is true so she will most definitely use her new weapon, Ser Robert Strong (The Mountain), in a trial by combat. Who would the Faith choose as a champion? Its been speculated that they would choose Sandor Clegane who is thought to still be alive and living in the Riverlands in a sort of a monastery where he was converted to the Faith. Id say there is a 20% chance that Cleganebowl will actually happen. 
So once Cersei learns of Myrcellas death (if she is in fact dead probably) she will most certainly blame Jaime and this will ultimately be the falling out of their relationship. She also wont like it that Trystane will be in KL so who knows what shell do with him. I just see her going into an escalating insanity where she becomes even more protective of Tommen due the prophecy given to her as a child. Tommen will die and her insanity will continue. I see her living until the end and then dying probably during Episode 10 of Season 7.

TL;DR: Will have a trial by combat and continually descend into insanity.


Brienne: I personally had a problem with Brienne going after Stannis instead of waiting for Sansa (especially since Sansa lit the candle right after Brienne left). I know Brienne feels like its her duty to kill Stannis but she took an oath to protect Sansa and Arya and all she does it talk about oaths, so I think that would be more important to her, but still Shell continue to look for Sansa who she will think is still in Winterfell unless she is given some other sort of information to tell her that Sansa has escaped. Once she finds that out I believe the logical next step would be to head north to the Wall, since it is believed that Jon Snow is Sansas last family member.

TL;DR: Will continue to look for Sansa. If she finds out that she has escaped I think Brienne will head north to the Wall since Jon Snow is believed to be Sansas last family member.


Sansa and Theon: She DID survive that landing because why the hell wouldnt she? What kind of story would that be? So, since she escaped with Theon itll be interesting to see what shell do. She has two options: head to the Wall to find Jon or go to the nearest Northern Lord and declare herself the last Stark. If she chooses to, she could raise the entire North against the Boltons and most certainly defeat them. In doing so, she would become Wardeness of the North. This would definitely shake things up because Baelish would be unable to take the North in his name and Cersei would have a HUGE problem with this. This is definitely how Id like to see Sansas storyline go. As for Theon, I believe hell try to rekindle his relationship with Sansa and support her to make up for his sins against the rest of the Stark family. To see these two characters end up as good friends would be very satisfying as a viewer.

TL;DR: Sansa either goes to the Wall or goes to another Northern house to raise the rest of the North against the Boltons. She takes the North and becomes its Wardeness. Theon becomes her friend and works to make up for his sins against her family.


Sam and Gilly: Sam Gilly are heading south to Oldtown so that Sam can study to become a maester. My question is how he will take the news of Jons death. Word will eventually reach him and I honestly dont know how hell take it. Right before Sam leaves the Wall, Jon and him have think long stare at each other and you can just tell of sad both of them are to be leaving each other. Either way, Sam will continue on as a maester apprentice and judging by the list of new characters that GoT is looking to cast next season, it looks like hell be reunited with his family and, most importantly, his father. This will probably help Sam become more of a man as he faces the man who sent him away. Definitely interested in seeing how he grows. Gilly will probably just be there and their relationship will grow. Sam will have taken two vows to not have sex, one of which he already broke, so yea not sure how far their romantic relationship will go.

TL;DR: Sam will study as a maester. He will eventually be reunited with his family and have to face his father. His relationship with Gilly will continue to develop.


Margery and Loras: They both have trials in which there is enough evidence to prove them guilty. I could see trials by combat happen where Loras fights for both of them. Thats a very unassured guess though.


Dany: Shell be taken as a prisoner of the Dothraki. I see Drogon as being her ticket out of this bad situation. Hell come flying in to prove how strong she is and then also judging by the fact that she has wanted her own khalissar since the beginning of season 2, shell recruit these Dothraki to fight for her. Once she does, shell return to Meereen, probably finding Jorah and Daario along the way. By then, shell have enough soldiers and ships to sail to Westeros. I completely expect to see her landing on the shores of Westeros by the end of season 6. Im not really sure what she will do with the cities on Slavers Bay that she has liberated. Most likely, shell put people in charge of the cities to keep them controlled or her efforts might fail and they all slip back into slavery.

TL;DR: Recruits the Dothraki and sets sail for Westeros.


Mel: The scene right before Jon Snows death is when she returns to Castle Black. Davos asks her about Stannis and Shireen and all she gives as a reply is a sullen look then she walks off. One major detail about Mel is that she really has no purpose besides being a councilor to the champion of the Lord of Light, so if Stannis is not the champion then she has no purpose in the story unless a new one arises, which I think is Jon Snow. It is obvious that she sees something in him that makes him stronger than most, so I believe she has a suspicion that Jon could be the champion. This would then leader her to reviving him in some way. 

TL;DR: Shell probably revive Jon.


Arya: So Aryas last scene confused me even more the second time than it did the first. Jaqen drinks the poison. He dies then the other girl who was holding Arya turns into Jaqen and the body she thought was Jaqen has even more faces and then hers is on the bottom. Something completely fucked up is going on. If Jaqens face was used by someone else then he would already have to be dead and if the girl put on Jaqens face (probably not) or actually was Jaqen then she would have to be dead. And then if Aryas face was used by someone else then it would have to be dead. I seriously have no clue what happened. So yea shes blind and shell probably try to continue her training by no using her eyesight. 

TL;DR: Shes blind and shell probably try to continue her training by no using her eyesight. Then shell kill everyone on her list at least I hope so.


Tyrion: I think Tyrions story is pretty simple from here on out. Hell rule in Meereen and most likely do well but have some problems along the way. Once Dany returns, hell head to Westeros with her and will probably work to recruit houses for her cause. What I would really like to happen is Sansa becomes the Wardeness of the North and joins Danys cause. By doing so, she could rekindle the relationship she had with Tyrion and who knows maybe shell want to marry him again. Ultimately, I see Tyrion living the rest of him life doing what he loves in Kings Landing: being the Hand of the Queen.

TL;DR: Hell rule in Meereen then sail to Westeros with Dany and recruit houses for her cause. If she wins, hell become the Hand of the Queen.


White Walkers: Last and definitely not least. The White Walkers will probably play the most important role in the last two seasons. They attacked Hardhome at the end of season 5 so Im going to predict an attack on the Wall from them within the first half of season 6. The very first scene in GoT introduces us to the White Walkers, so I think its safe to say that once they start attacking it wont be easy to put them down. The Nights Watch and Wildlings will most certainly be unable to fight against the White Walkers for a long period of time. Sooner or later they will break the Wall. It was specifically designed so they cant get around it so it wont be an easy task but certainly not impossible. Once they get through this is where all the storylines of our characters in Westeros will come together. Eventually, I see the White Walkers reaching the North and by then hopefully the lords of Westeros will know that they need to work together to fight them. I could see a battle at Winterfell being where Westeros tries to fight back in full force. This part of the story is definitely open to a lot of different possibilities.

TL;DR: Read above. Most important part of the entire GoT story.

**TL;DR:** Shell probably revive Jon.


**Arya:** So Aryas last scene confused me even more the second time than it did the first. Jaqen drinks the poison. He dies then the other girl who was holding Arya turns into Jaqen and the body she thought was Jaqen has even more faces and then hers is on the bottom. Something completely fucked up is going on. If Jaqens face was used by someone else then he would already have to be dead and if the girl put on Jaqens face (probably not) or actually was Jaqen then she would have to be dead. And then if Aryas face was used by someone else then it would have to be dead. I seriously have no clue what happened. So yea shes blind and shell probably try to continue her training by no using her eyesight. 

**TL;DR:** Shes blind and shell probably try to continue her training by no using her eyesight. Then shell kill everyone on her list at least I hope so.


**Tyrion:** I think Tyrions story is pretty simple from here on out. Hell rule in Meereen and most likely do well but have some problems along the way. Once Dany returns, hell head to Westeros with her and will probably work to recruit houses for her cause. What I would really like to happen is Sansa becomes the Wardeness of the North and joins Danys cause. By doing so, she could rekindle the relationship she had with Tyrion and who knows maybe shell want to marry him again. Ultimately, I see Tyrion living the rest of him life doing what he loves in Kings Landing: being the Hand of the Queen.

**TL;DR:** Hell rule in Meereen then sail to Westeros with Dany and recruit houses for her cause. If she wins, hell become the Hand of the Queen.


**Bran:** So Bran was left out last season. From what we see of Bran in season 4, it can be assumed that he's basically been training ""to fly"" with the three eyed raven. He'll be able to control his wargism and visions better which will probably lead us to some very cool flashbacks. One flashback in particular has been getting a lot of buzz due to a reason leak of a filming location and a character that they are trying to cast for the show. I feel like Bran will have a vision of what happened at the Tower of Joy, which will prove Jon Snow's parentage once and for all. I don't really know what to predict past Bran just training though. He could possibly head south after his training, but now that the White Walkers are moving south they are the only humans left Beyond the Wall. Maybe he heads to the White Walker castle where he might be able to their source of magic or something. I'm not sure, but he'll definitely be a bad ass Stark once agains.

**TL;DR:** Has a vision of the Tower of Joy and finishes training. From there... idk.


**White Walkers:** Last and definitely not least. The White Walkers will probably play the most important role in the last two seasons. They attacked Hardhome at the end of season 5 so Im going to predict an attack on the Wall from them within the first half of season 6. The very first scene in GoT introduces us to the White Walkers, so I think its safe to say that once they start attacking it wont be easy to put them down. The Nights Watch and Wildlings will most certainly be unable to fight against the White Walkers for a long period of time. Sooner or later they will break the Wall. It was specifically designed so they cant get around it so it wont be an easy task but certainly not impossible. Once they get through this is where all the storylines of our characters in Westeros will come together. Eventually, I see the White Walkers reaching the North and by then hopefully the lords of Westeros will know that they need to work together to fight them. I could see a battle at Winterfell being where Westeros tries to fight back in full force. This part of the story is definitely open to a lot of different possibilities.

**TL;DR:** Read above. Most important part of the entire GoT story.




**EDIT**
I left Jon out at first but I'm actually reconsidering leaving him out, which I did in the first place because it has been covered so much, but I'll try to ""briefly"" go over the few options.

**Jon Snow:** So Jon is dead. 100% dead. That pool of blood pretty much tells it all, but as we've seen with Beric and Thoros a Red Priest/Priestess is able to revive people multiple times depending on their wounds (just can't have a chopped off head or I guess something ripped out). The scene right before Jon is killed, Mel returns to Castle Black. THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE. Mel abandons Stannis right after she learns that half his army has deserted, and, as I believe I stated in Mel's section, she really has no purpose in the story unless she is with R'hllor's champion. It is not stated in the show, but in the books she has multiple visions of Jon Snow in her fires. This perplexes her because she doesn't understand why she is being show his face. Mel is meant to help Jon in some way. Reviving him would be her first step. But how to revive him? In the books it is more clearly stated that Jon is a warg, who are thought to have their souls warg into their animals when they die. If Jon is indeed a warg then he'll go into Ghost when he dies (which he did). Knowing that R'hllor has some seriously immense powers, Mel could eventually find out that Jon's soul is living in Ghost and then somehow bring him back. In the end... there are just too many possibilities in Jon Snow's scenario. He is dead. He could stay dead. He could come back to life. He could be Azor Ahai. He could come back in someway that we haven't even though of at surprises the shit out of all of us. He could... he could... he could...

So let the record reflect, I'm calling it now:

Jon Snow will not have a resurrection scene filmed on the set of GoT.

Wait, don't go away! Hear me out. Kit has a movie in production now called ""Brimstone"", a mystery/thriller/spaghetti-ish western flick that isn't likely to set box office records... but that's beside the point. I'll put it like this:

1. Kit Harington hasn't changed his appearance since the end of Season 5, something that many of our dearly-departed former cast members have tended to do
2. Everyone's looking to the GoT film sets with anticipation, and the fact that he has another movie filming while the rest of the GoT cast is getting geared up would seem like confirmation that he's not coming back. 
3. One of his co-stars is Clarice Van Houten, AKA Melisandre AKA The Red Woman. 
4. Any critical scene involving Snow is going to also need Melisandre and it can all be filmed ""indoors"" (smaller, cheaper set). Don't expect a major POV role, but 5 minutes on screen is all they'd need to set it up for season 7.
5. Brimstone also features Jack Roth, who has also been a cast member on GoT as a Brother of the Night's Watch.

My theory: they're actually going to tack this scene onto the filming schedule for Brimstone and keep an absolute skeleton crew on set for filming. The movie is real, but also a very clever means of misdirection.",6,5,False,self,,,,,

* Brienne of Tarth

She is strong, honorable and the perfect (wo)man of duty. I don't think she cares a lot about marrying. Also it would be progressive for Westeros the have its first female member and Lord commander of the Kingsguard. (Feel free to correct me on this if my facts are wrong.)

* Ser Robert Strong aka Ser Gregor Clegane aka ""The Mountain""

Say whatever you want to say about his character but he is physically the strongest man in Westeros. He will kill and die for his king without hesitation.

* Grey Worm

If we can have a non Westerosi spymaster why not a member of the kingsguard as well? I believe having a member with a different fight technique would make the kingsguard stronger. His little amputation would make him more faithful to his vows and determened. (Under the rule of a Daenerys Targaryen it can even be considered to recruit the whole unsullied as the city watch.)

* Bronn

Why not? Is he any less trustworthy than all those other plotting, sneaky lords? Without any great house supporting him, doing a perfect job as kingsguard is his only way of reaching fame and glory in this life and I think he would understand that. Yes, he would find himself in Kingslanding's brothels now and then but when it comes to combat he wouldn't run away.

* Alisser Thorne

After all those years he served the realm well he deserves to come back to the south and be of use there. He became way too influential in the Night's Watch and that should not be allowed. He already made vow of celibacy so he doesn't have anything to lose.

bonus: Jamie Lannister. 
He is always a good pick and knows the job well but without his sword hand don't expact a lot from him combat.

bonus 2: Ser Twenty of House Goodmen. 
If only we could find four other men like him the Kingsguard would have the power of a small army of 100 men.

As much as I love Tyrion and expect great things from him, I just can't accept this theory. It seems like fans grasping at any possible way to connect their favorite characters. 

Now I've just finished reading AFFC, and I believe this theory is debunked within the book. Not long after Jaime arrives at the Riverrun siege, he has a conversation with his aunt, Lady Genna. Together they speak of the late Lord Tywin's legacy. At the end of the conversation (also the end of the chapter, which usually all end with large revelations or cliff hangers) Lady Genna tells Jaime that he is wrong to believe he can live up to his father's legacy. She says Tyrion is the one who takes after their father Tywin, not Jaime. 

"" Jaime, sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak...but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year. ""

I feel that this implies Tyrion is destined to do great things and become a great leader (not necessarily King), but it also shuts down any chance of him being fathered by the Mad King. Or even the Dragonknight as some really ridiculous theories suggest... Lady Genna grew up with Tywin and presumably knew her brother very well. I feel it odd for her to have miscalculated the similarities between her nephew and her brother. 

I expect some may argue Tywin we so upset because he hated Tyrion for not being his. But he hated Tyrion for killing his wife. I find it hard to believe Tywin knowingly raised his wife's bastard, born of a Targaryen. 

Now we all know the show has been getting drastically different from the books. Me being a show watcher first was amazed at the amount of differences. And maybe D&amp;D have decided to go a different way and make Tyrion a Targaryen. But it seems like GRRM does not have that plan. ",13,9,False,self,,,,,

Ned was great too, but obviously he's gone before you can really get to know him. Though, the more I hear about the possibilities of Jon and Tyrion both being Targaryens, the more I think Eddard and Tywin are two sides of the same coin.  


1) They both fought under Robert in the Rebellion. Ned obviously with more honorable reasons, and Tywin selfishly playing the game and making the best moves for his family's name. 


2) They both lose important women in their lives to child birth that change them forever; these women were also both hopelessly loved by kings ironically. We all assume Lyanna dies giving birth to Jon, and we know for sure that Tyrion's birth kills Joanna. *[Side note: LyANNA/JoANNA. Pretty close, idkkk.]* Maybe there is something about Targaryens **NOT** being born of incest that can really fuck with the pregnancy. *Possibly tying in the death of Dany's unborn Rhaego...?*


3) They must keep their secrets from Robert. He famously ordered the death of every Targaryen remaining in King's Landing. Ned saves Jon as Lyanna's dying wish (being honorable and all) and Tywin remains hushed about Tyrion because of his love for Joanna and not wanting to reflect poorly on her or himself (being all family name oriented and all.)


4) They both ('try to' in Tywin's case) send ""their kids"" to the Night's Watch. Perhaps it is so they can both be relieved of the burden of having these painful reminders around, or maybe they're trying to cleanly rid Westeros of possible Targaryen heirs to the throne. Maybe the only reason Aemon is at Castle Black in the story to is get the point across and be a constant reminder that once you join the Watch, you may hold no lands or bear children. 

5) Other minor details and possible symbolism: Tywin is introduced as Ned is on the way out of the story. The stag and direwolf killing eachother is one of the first things we see. Tywin skinning an already dead stag is the first we see of him.


Let me know if this all makes sense and whip me with knowledge if I'm off.

In the books, as well as in the show, several things are driven home so much that support this theory. I can't believe I didn't see it sooner. 

1. It is constantly mentioned that Lyssa Arryn has had true affections for Petyr since the days he fostered with them at River Run.

2. Robert/Robin is a very sickly, non-physical child.

3. John Arryn was nothing like this, he was a strong, honorable man. 

4. Petyr Baslish was/is EXACTLY like that. If you ask me, they even resemble one another. 

So what would be the implications if this were actually the truth? Who knows, but it's fun to think about and it's awesome that GRRM writes in such a way that leaves so many interesting theories open for possibility. What are your thoughts?

It's been a good chunk of time since the end of Season 5, and I am glad to see many a show watcher join us book readers in speculation and fan theories that we have been swimming in for years now. As we are not making a follow up post for an episode we will tackle a topic of my choosing.  

One of the areas I wish to cover in the off season is to break down a few of the more popular fan theories surrounding both A Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire..  And today we tackle something truly special, and something I can guess most of you are all at least somewhat familiar with.. The theory surrounding Jon Snow's parentage.  Now between the popularity of the theory spreading out on the internet in the last year or so via youtube videos, older articles over on Tower of the Hand, and the theory spreading through general media I would imagine that much of this is redundant to you all.. But for some this might be the first time hearing this, you never know.. But If you have heard this all before I will offer something a bit extra.. Many of the articles/videos I see do not present the counter evidences against the other contenders for Jon's parentage, I will try to offer that here.. And I will also hope to offer a few splinter theories that relate to Jon's parentage here as well. So even if you are all caught up on what is R+L=J  there might be something here that you didn't know  So sit back and enjoy today's post..

**Note on Spoiler Scope**

This post is tagged spoilers for all books, and all show.. However, I will pull from the novels the only information relevant to the topic at hand.. Anything unrelated, or book info that has not yet been covered in the show should be hidden behind a tag.   In addition, for obvious reasons this thread will also be tagged as a theory as it is as of yet unconfirmed in the books. However for the splinter theory section at the end I will need to pull from one thing that has happened in the books, relating to a topic still to be covered in the show.. It will be covered, and I will give a small warning when I get there.  

---------


**R+L=J The Theory and the Narrative**

- The Theory

To begin we must first define what exactly is the theory at hand.. R+L=J is a vastly accepted theory that Jon Snow is not the bastard child of Eddard Stark and an unidentified woman, but the child of Ned's sister Lyanna, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.  And that Lyanna willfully ran away with Rhaegar (as opposed to being kidnapped, as Robert Baratheon suggests) and the result of their relationship was a child, Jon Snow.  The theory also suggests that Lyanna's death, witnessed only by Eddard Stark and his  companion Howland Reed, was a result of a complicated childbirth, leading to the bed of blood Ned finds her in just prior to her death.  Ned taking Jon in as his own was in effort to to protect the child, and a last request of his sister Lyanna.   That's the theory, but before we dive into the evidence for it, let's take a brief look at the timeline of events that led us here..  

- The Events/The Facts. 

If you needed a start point to the course of events that led to Eddard Stark taking in his nephew as his own bastard son you need to focus back to an event nearly two year prior, the great Tourney at Harrenhal.  Now I did a breakdown on the Tourney at Harrenhall during this most recent season, which you can check out [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/34ubu0/55adwdlore_the_tourney_at_harrenhal_in_the_year/), so I will not reiterate too much in this post, and stick to what's relevant to the topic at hand.  A great many things happened at the Tourney at Harrenhall, a great many of the noble families were in attendance, including House Stark, and the Royal House Targaryen.   The tourney concluded with prince Rheagar as the champion winning the joust by unseating Ser Barrastian Selmy in the final tilt.  As a champion crowns a queen of love and beauty (usually the woman a knight wears the favor of during a tourney) the crowd at the Tourney was shocked when the prince rode past his own wife Elia Martell and placed a crown of blue winter roses on the lap of Lyanna Stark naming her queen of Love and Beauty.  Nearly a year went by went by when Prince Rhaegar vanished.. not to be found at Kings Landing nor his home at Dragonstone last seen near the godseye near Harrenhall.. Meanwhile while en route to her brother Brandon's wedding to Catelyn Tully, Lyanna disappeared in the Riverlands, not far from Harrenhall itself did Rhaegar abscond with Lyanna in an apparent kidnapping.  

What followed was a massive rebellion that left House Targaryen dismantled and dethroned, and paved the way for the royal house Baratheon taking the throne. But there are some events worth note that happened during the rebellion that lasted roughly a year.  The most relevant bit being that Prince Rhaegar was not to be found on the battlefield or a commander's tent.. He did not participate, at all.. That was at least until he finally reappeared at the Battle of the Trident where Rhaegar met his demise at the hands of Robert Baratheon and his massive hammer.  

After the fighting was over, and King's Landing was sacked the rebel forces were all located at the capital.   It was here that Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon quarreled over the fates of the children of Elia Martell and Rhaegar, Eddard wanted justice for what was done to them, and Robert neglected, relishing in the deaths of the Targaryen children.  Eddard left the capital on bad terms with Robert, for his callousness and attitude towards the Targaryen children, and his wont to hunt down a young prince Viserys and Queen Rhaella (pregnant with Daenerys at this time).  Eddard first lifted the Siege of Storms end before traveling to rescue his sister, being kept in a small stronghold on near the mountains of Dorne.. The Tower of Joy.  

What we know of what Transpired at the Tower of Joy (ToJ) comes from both a conversation Eddard had with Robert in the Winterfell crypts, and from a fever dream Eddard has while he lay injured from his fight with Jaime Lannister outside Littlefinger's Brothel.  In this dream Eddard recalls that he and six other companions reached the ToJ and were met by the remaining members of King Aerys' Kingsguard.  Ser Arthur Dayne, Lord Commander Gerold Hightower, and Ser Oswell Whent remaining bound by an oath to remain in guard of the Tower.  The two parties share brief conversation before doing battle.  After the fighting was done only two men remained alive, Eddard Stark and Howland Reed (Father of Meera and Jojen Reed traveling with Bran in seasons 3 and 4).  Ned goes up the tower to find his sister in a bed of blood, near death.  Before she dies she makes Eddard promise her something, something not told to the readers.  This term promise me Ned pops up several times throughout A Game of Thrones when Ned is reminded of his sister.  Lyanna dies in Ned's presence, and is returned to Winterfell and buried in the crypts among the Kings and Lords of Winterfell.  Lyanna's death reconciles Ned and Robert, and Ned returns home to spend the next 14 years (17 in the show) as Lord of Winterfell.  Only one thing being off, Ned returned home with a Bastard, a Son he apparently had during the war.. Jon Snow. 
 
Before we move on to the actual evidences for the theory I want to call attention to something that comes up quite a bit in relation to Lyanna Stark.. and that being Blue Winter Roses.  In the novels blue winter roses are synonymous with Lyanna's character.  She was noted for growing them in the Winterfell glass gardens (greenhouses), she was crowned Queen of Love and Beauty with a crown of the blue roses.  In Ned's fever dream a shower of blue roses rains down on him when he remembers her calling his (Ned's) name.  When Ned discovers Lyanna near death he remembers the scent of blood and roses, suggesting that the flowers adorned the chambers where she was kept.  Her statue in the Winterfell crypts is adorned with a garland of the Winter Roses...etc  It is a apparent that the author (GRRM) wants the reader to know and associate Blue Winter Roses with Lyanna..this becomes important later. 

-------------------


**R+L=J: The Evidences**

- The Character of Rhaegar. 

Before we travel to the actual evidence for the theory we first need to discuss the character of Rhaegar Targaryen.  Early in A Game of Throne, and in Season 1 of the show we are presented with a vastly negative image of the Prince of Dragonstone.  From Robert Baratheon the reader and the viewer is left to think of Rhaegar as a violent, murderous, rapist who kidnapped Lyanna and did a number of unspeakable acts that led to her death... which as far as the realm is concerned is the official story.  But as 4 more novels, and 4 more seasons of the TV show have demonstrated that this negative view on Rhaegar is held seemingly only by Robert Baratheon and  to a degree Viserys Targaryen (who viewed his older brother as a fierce warrior).  When any other character mentions Rhaegar in conversation, from Ser Barrastian, Ser Jorah, to Cersei Lannister it is with reverence. To most in the realm Rhaegar was a paragon of what a prince and an heir apparent should be, chivalrous, courteous, charitable, a man who did not relish in fighting, but in the playing of music and the reading of books. Even Eddard himself does not share Robert's views on Rhaegar, reflecting that he did not think Rhaegar would visit such places as Littlefinger's establishments as Robert has.  Basically not the type of person to kidnap and rape the daughter of a Northern Lord.   This suggests that when both Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared that it was mutual, they ran off together, she was not kidnapped. 

- The White Cloaks at the Tower

Now to the evidence, the first and foremost of the evidence being the presence of the three members of the Kingsguard at the Tower of Joy, why were they there?  The first thing to consider is that they were ordered/took oaths to remain there under Rhaegar's orders, and in fact a simple interpretation of the account of the ToJ could imply that.. But let's consider what are the chief-most vows to a member of the Kingsguard.  The Primary act of the Kingsguard is the protection of the King, and secondly the protection of the King's family.  Ser Oswell, Ser Arthur, and Ser Gerold remained by the sides of Rhaegar during the Rebellion while other Kingsguard either remained with the King, or on the Battlefield fighting the King's war as commanders.  But any oath or order that a prince gives is superseded by the primary function of the Kingsguard, protecting the King.  At the time Ned travels to the ToJ, both King Aerys and Prince Rhaegar are dead, and so any command that Rhaegar gave them to stay at the Tower is void at his death, if not at Aerys' death.  By their oaths as men of the Kingsguard they should be making every attempt to travel to Dragonstone to seek out and crown Prince Viserys as King.. but they do not.  Their continued presence at the ToJ to protect Rhaegar's mistress does not make any sense... But if a newly born Targaryen Prince remains at the ToJ, their presence suddenly does make sense... This also suggests that Lyanna and Rhaegar were married; if Jon were merely a Targaryen bastard the Kingsguard members would still be bound to Viserys.  With the deaths of Rhaegar's other children this child, Jon, is the heir apparent, and the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, fully explaining why the Kingsguard remained at the Tower, and died to protect an infant prince and his mother.    

- Promise Me Ned

So what to make of Ned's Promise to Lyanna.  At this point it is easy to guess what it was.. To Protect her infant son.  At this point Ned had witnessed the destruction of a Nobel House, seen his best friend turn monstrous when it came to the Targaryens.. If the truth had gotten out about Jon's true parentage there is no doubt that Robert would seek to have the child murdered. So Ned did the only thing he could do, he lied. He broke his honor and lied for 14 years that Jon Snow was his bastard son, lies which haunted him during that time.  By taking Jon on as his own bastard he kept the child alive, honored Lyanna's dying wish, and in his mind kept the realm from another bloody war by hiding the truth from everyone, even from Jon himself.  

- Evidence in The House of the Undying

In A Clash of Kings when Daenerys visits the House of the Undying she drinks Shade of the Evening and begins her journey though the building.. In the books she has many different visions she does not have in the show, 2 of which pertain specifically to the topic at hand..

&gt;Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name. 

This vision deals with the death of Rhaegar after being given a fatal blow by Robert Baratheon's Warhammer.  Readers can only speculate to the name Rhaegar whispered while dying.. One thing is clear, the author leaves this intentionally ambiguous....Causing the reader to speculate that there might be more beneath the words presented on the page...If Rhaegar's dying thoughts were merely on Elia Martell then why leave it behind a curtain of mystery such as this.. If it is Lyanna then things are a bit different.  

The next vision is MUCH more telling, and in my honest opinion the nail in the coffin confirming the theory of Jon's parentage..

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice and filled the air with sweetness.

It is easy to miss this short, seeming unimportant bit of prose when first reading this.  But once you are aware of the theory and the circumstances surrounding it this bit becomes one of the most telling bits that George R. R. Martin has crafted in his work..  Once again, as I have stated earlier we are meant to associate blue flowers, specifically blue winter roses with Lyanna's character, but the fact that Dany and the reader discovers the rose in a wall of ice is more telling.. What immediately comes to mind when Wall of Ice is presented to the reader... The Wall, the Night's Watch... and Who does the reader know that is associated with either of those things... Jon Fucking Snow.  There is an immediate symbolic connection between Lyanna and Jon Snow.. IMO sealing the deal and confirming the theory in my book.  

Well that's it for the Major evidences presented in the Novels, for Jon's parentage, but in part of presenting evidences for any hypothesis, we must also work to disconfirm any other possible hypothesis...  so in the next section I wish to cover the other candidates for Jon's parentage and illustrate why I do not think they qualify as Ned's baby momma. Let's begin..


-----------------

**Ladys, Wet Nurses, and Red Herrings**

- Ashara Dayne: The Story

Ashara Dayne was a noblewoman of House Dayne, a house in service to Dorne.. She was the sister of Ser Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard, and hers is a sad tale.   Like many she is remembered for attending the Tourney at Harrenhall where she drew the attention of many different gentleman that wished to wear her favor at the tourney, and many of whom wished to court.. Most notably Eddard Stark.  He was enamored with her, but too shy to ask her hand for a dance, so Ned's elder brother Brandon spoke to her on his behalf.  It is not not known how involved Ned and Ashara became.  Ser Barrristan Selmy recalls of the Tourney how he too was enamored of Ashara, and wore her favor in the tourney.. he also recalls that one of the Starks had dishonored Ashara at the Tourney..  suggesting that Brandon Stark was also enamored with Ashara.  Rumors of a pregnancy had surrounded Ashara Dayne after the Tourney, of which Selmy believes resulted in the birth of a stillborn child by way of one of the Starks, but none of this has been confirmed.   

After the duel at the Tower of Joy, Eddard Stark traveled to Starfall to return the remains of her Brother, and the sword Dawn to House Dayne.  It is here where Ned reconnected with Ashara.  Many believe that in the aftermath of the War, reuniting with the Man she loved, and in the grief of losing her bother the pair conceived Jon Snow.  Sadly however if this is the case the joy was short lived.. Not too long after Ned left Starfall, Jon in tow, Ashara threw herself from the highest tower at Starfall, her body was never found.. Why did she do this? The grief of losing her brother at the hands of the man she loved (and possibly the father of her child), Ned leaving... or possibly the earlier loss of the stillborn child? It is unclear.. Many in the realm believe Ashara the mother of Jon Snow... including Catelyn Stark herself, a rumor she heard among the kitchen workers at Winterfell.. When She brought this rumor to Ned, he became as angry as he had ever been with her, and told her to never speak of Ashara again, after that Ashara's name was never heard or spoken of in Winterfell again... Ashara is clearly a sore spot for Ned, and we as readers still have a lot to learn of House Dayne and their relationship with the Starks, but is that all because of Jon.... I don't think so, and here's why...

- Ashara Dayne, the evidence against..

The biggest piece of evidence against Ashara being the mother of Jon Snow is the timeline of events, Ned's honor, and proximity of parties....  The first thing we need to do is set a general timeline of events, starting with the Tourney at Harrenhall.  That tourney is said to have taken place roughly a year before the start of Robert's Rebellion.. Robert's Rebellion itself is said to have lasted a year before the victory for the rebellion occurred (as well as the Sack on the Keep/Tower of Joy/Ned traveling to Starfall).  So we have a timeline of roughly two years from the Tourney at Harrenhall to Ned Traveling to Starfall.  Lastly we know of one thing for certain, and that is the conception of Ned's first trueborn son..Robb Stark to Catelyn Tully just before the outset of the War... 

In both the novels and in the show it is noted that both Robb Stark and Jon Snow are of the same age.. 14 years (19 in the show).  And it is their respective ages that disconfirms Ashara as the potential mother for Jon Snow..  The only known meetings of Ned Stark and Ashara Dayne were at the the Tourney at Harrenhall, and after the War when Ned travels to Starfall.. If either of those dates resulted in the conception of Jon Snow, it puts the respective ages with his half brother Robb out of sync by a year in either direction.. which we know is not the case.  The only alternative we have is is that sometime early in the war Ned met with Ashara and conceived Jon.. this brings me to the second issue..Proximity of Parties.  At the Outset of the War Ned was beginning his campaign in the Riverlands while Ashara remained at Starfall.. It is highly unlikely that in the middle of a campaign that Ned travelled across the Reach, and into Dorne (Both regions that were loyal to the Targaryens during the Rebellion) for a booty call, and it is just as unlikely that Ashara left Stafall during that same time period without anyone noticing.  In closing, Ashara being Jon's mother just doesn't work.. 

Lastly in regards to Ned's honor.. This only holds true if we are to believe that Jon was conceived at the Tourney at Harrenhall.  The fact that Ned has a bastard is a constant reminder of his guilt and a slight on his honor mentioned several times in the first novel.. Jon is a constant reminder of him dishonoring Catelyn..but if he had conceived a bastard at the Tourney at Harrenhall where does that guilt come from.. at the Tourney Ned was an eligible bachelor... His brother was betrothed to Catelyn, not him.. Messing around with Ashara at that point is not a slight on Catelyn... but we leave Ashara here, and move on to our next candidate..

- Wylla, the Wet Nurse. 

The biggest thing Wylla has going for her is that this unknown woman was named by Ned himself to Robert (as seemingly the official story) as the Mother of his bastard.. So who is Wylla?  Wylla is/was a serving woman at Starfall, a wet nurse in service to House Dayne.  Not much more is known about her other than traveled to Winterfell and acted as a wet nurse to Jon Snow.. or possibly his mother herself..  However Ned's word to Robert is not the only mention we have of Wylla.. In A Storm of Swords Arya Stark happens on the current Lord of Starfall while being held captive by the Brotherhood Without Banners, Edric Dayne.  Edric is roughly the same age as Jon, and tells Arya that he and Jon Snow are Milk Brothers, saying that he shared milk from the same woman...Wylla, Jon's mother.  Nothing more comes of this conversation.. but it seems to be another tick in Wylla's column as Jon's mohter... but not so fast..

Wylla presents the same problems of timelines (In Relation to the age of Robb Sark) as Ashara Dayne does.. If she is a servant at Starfall when and where would she have met Eddard to conceive Jon?  If she got pregnant with Jon when Ned traveled to Starfall it would make Jon a year younger than Robb, which we know is, once again, not the case.. But we have two verifications of matriarchy? What does that mean?  The only explanation I can think of is that the Daynes are in on it, they would have to be if Ned showed up with the infant son of Lyanna when he travled to Sarfall..  Wylla traveling to Winterfell helps bolster the rumor of her being the mother of Jon, as does the words of Edric (if he is even aware).. Once again, House Dayne is going to be one of the most interesting houses to pay attention to going forward in the novels, but as far as them or their servants being the other half of Jon's parents...It doesn't look that way.. 


- The Fisherman's Daughter

This last bit I will try to keep short.. In A Dance With Dragons Davos Seaworth is traveling in the north in an effort to reach White Harbor, seat of Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor..  En Route he finds shelter and refuge with Lord Godric Borrell who recalls the time when his house sheltered Eddard Stark. Lord Borrell remembers that when Brandon Stark and Lord Rickard Stark met their ends at the hands of the Mad King, that Ned's head was called for by King Aerys.  Ned at the time was a ward of Lord Jon Arryn at the Eryie, and at the outset of the Rebellion Eddard had to make his way back to Winterfell in order to call his banners and march to War.. To do that Ned had to travel across a span of sea known as The Bite to make his way back into The North.  To do this he had the help of an unknown fisherman, this fisherman fought the storms and winds of the bite to deliver Ned to the North, but died in the effort.. Not all was lost however as the Fisherman's Daughter finished the task carrying Ned the rest of the way, and in return received a sack of gold, and a bastard in her belly, making this unknown woman the mother of Jon Snow..

Now what to make of this.. first of all, in this instance timelines match.. If this woman is the mother of Jon Snow, it would make Jon two or three months older than Robb, at most.. But are we really meant to buy this?  Ned's honor would be up for debate.. he still was not yet married to Catelyn..how would the fisherman's daughter be dishonoring her?  Maybe if he were expecting to carry on Brandon's betrothal, but it's a stretch.. How would Ned have ever found out about this child?  An unknown woman randomly turning up to the party returning to Winterfell with an infant child she claims as Ned's should call attention to itself, but no mention of such an even is known.  I believe the reader is meant to chalk this one up as a simple red herring (fitting considering she is the daughter of a fisherman).  While bastards are frowned upon amongst the highborn, amongst the lowborn that is not the case.. A lowborn woman carrying the bastard of a highborn, moresoe that of a high lord himself is often regarded as a badge of honor.. no doubt if you scouted the entire realm you would find dozens of stories of the Woman who got Lord Stark in bed during the war and produced a bastard.. I believe this tale of the Fishermans daughter is one of these instances. 

Well that's it for the (known) other candidates for the mother of Jon Snow.. Please stick around for the last section where we will (briefly) break down some of the splinter theories that relate to R+L=J...

&gt; Maggy: Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.

So, I've heard a lot of theories about this prophecy. Tyrion is the obvious guess, but with him being in Essos now, I don't think that he's the one that would fill the role of the valonqar. Also, it just seems too obvious. Jaime is another guess seen around a lot, but it also seems kind of like the obvious choice. One theory that I saw the other day was that Sandor Clegane would fill the valonqar role (as he's the ""little brother"" of Gregor), which intrigued me. It got me thinking about what other ""little brothers"" there are since no part of the prophecy specifies that it has to be *Cersei's* little brother.

Something popped into my head that I haven't been able to shake (although I don't have much to back it up). **What about Tommen?** He clearly satisfies the little brother requirement, being the youngest of all three of Cersei's children. Furthermore, ""when your tears have drowned you"" makes me think even more that this is true, as Cersei just had her walk of shame (literally) and in the show, begins to cry near the end, which is the first time in the show IIRC that we see her cry. Also, we haven't seen Tommen at all in the second half of season 5, and I remember it being said that he was isolating himself up in his room. Could it be that he's been losing his mind up there, much like being in a cell (also, his mother and wife had just *actually* been imprisoned)? This is also the first time Cersei will see Tommen in a while since she's now back at the castle. I don't know why exactly Tommen would kill Cersei, which is where my theory weakens, but it seems like it would make for some excellent writing. Maybe he goes full Joffrey (or worse) and strangles Cersei after realizing that he was born of incest, who knows.

Forgive me if anything I said was incorrect, I'm obsessed with the show but I've only read a bit of the books; I've read a lot of book theories and I'm making my way through them now. :)

I am afraid that GoT (the TV series, not ASOIAF), is heading to the same fate. There are a lot of plots going on, tons of characters, and it doesn't seem to culminate on anything. 

Sure there are the eventual wars and deaths; they are very important, and their outcomes may define the progression of the story. But after so many deaths and wars, and so many things that happened to every character, each single event starts to lose value.

I mean, we who didn't read the books already know that Westeros is a neverending battlefield. So why bother showing details of these wars? 

The really unusual event, about which it is worth making an entire series, is the war between the ice zombies and men. But, in this scenario, only a handful of characters have the potential to actually matter, instead of being killed by the zombies and having their entire arch being thrown into space. Therefore, keeping this plethora of characters and stories, albeit being entertaining in the beginning, starts to become pointless.

Ok I know I said I wouldn't post here again but eeeeh, fuck it. I finished season 1 like 2 days ago but I had to pause at season 2 episode 1 because my uncle said he wanted to watch from the beginning, but now he's at season 3 and I'm still stuck at season 2. That son of a bitch!

Any ways, here are a few scenes that stood out to me in season one

 Caitlyn Stalk's sister breast feeding that kid!!! How old is that fucking kid!?? He looks like he should've stop sucking on his mother's tits a decade ago.

 The prison cell from that episode was MIND BLOWING! If I got locked in one of those I'd probably jump

 ""Are we gonna get to see the little man fly now"" Tyrion: ""Not this little man, this little man is going home"" LMAO 

 'Little Man' got all dressed up to go battle the north men and got knocked the fuck out before they even left the camp. Lool

 Drogo's death really pissed me off. Dude got a flesh wound and that fuck bitch witch said he would heal him. All of a sudden my boy Drogo falling off his horse, like WTF bitch! You said you'd heal him! What kind of dumb witch are you that doesn't know how to treat a flesh wound!?? I personally thought she should've been beheaded at that point. But nooo, Khaleesi just had to ask her to bring back Drogo from death. Like seriously!?? Bitch couldn't heal a flesh wound but you think she could bring back the dead!?? Stupid stupid Khalessi. Well at least the dragons were born

 Ned Stalk's dead didn't surprise me because some asshole commented on my previous post and spoiled it for me. But it was still sad. If only he had taken that 'piece of paper' to the council immediately after he had gotten it from King Robert. But I guess when he found out Joffery was the son of the 'twincest' he tried his best to make King Robert's brother king.

 King Robert's death was ridiculous lol, a wild hog!? Really???

 That scene where Little Finger was teaching the hookers how to please men was pretty hot. More scenes like that please!

 Ok so this is the scene that made me say ""WTF!!"". In the season finale [S01E10] there's a scenes with an old man (one of the council members) and a hooker. The old man seems fragile, weak and has a hunched back. He rambles some bullshit, then the hooker leaves the room. Then all of a sudden the old man gets up and starts stretching and flexing like he's 21! He didn't look old at all. Then he tides up and acts like an old man as he is about to leave the room. 

Can someone please tell me what was going on with that old man? Is he pretending to be old? Whyy?????

#My Favorite Characters

1. Little Finger - lol I don't remember his real name (i think it was something something Baelish) so I just call him Little Finger. This dude is really smart and I think he'll be one of the guys that'll be hard to kill.

2. Jon Snow - I'm pretty sure he's the star of this show. 

3. Aria Stalk - The tom boy. I don't know....i just like her

There's just so much more going on in this season and there's only 4 more episodes. 

They are going to be action packed and so guy wrenching. I'm excited to see them again, and I'm excited to have my dad along in this journey experiencing it for the first time. I move away for college next month, so it's so great to have these moments trying to binge watch until we catch up before I leave. 

I have no questions. I just wanted to share my excitement with all of you.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

Ok I know I said I wouldn't post here again but eeeeh, fuck it. I finished season 1 like 2 days ago but I had to pause at season 2 episode 1 because my uncle said he wanted to watch from the beginning, but now he's at season 3 and I'm still stuck at season 2. That son of a bitch!

#Any ways, here are a few scenes that stood out to me in season one

 Caitlyn Stark's sister breast feeding that kid!!! How old is that fucking kid!?? He looks like he should've stop sucking on his mother's tits a decade ago.

 The prison cell from that episode was MIND BLOWING! If I got locked in one of those I'd probably jump

 ""Are we gonna get to see the little man fly now"" Tyrion: ""Not this little man, this little man is going home"" LMAO 

 'Little Man' got all dressed up to go battle the north men and got knocked the fuck out before they even left the camp. Lool

 Drogo's death really pissed me off. Dude got a flesh wound and that fuck bitch witch said he would heal him. All of a sudden my boy Drogo falling off his horse, like WTF bitch! You said you'd heal him! What kind of dumb witch are you that doesn't know how to treat a flesh wound!?? I personally thought she should've been beheaded at that point. But nooo, Khaleesi just had to ask her to bring back Drogo from death. Like seriously!?? Bitch couldn't heal a flesh wound but you think she could bring back the dead!?? Stupid stupid Khalessi. Well at least the dragons were born

 Ned Stark's death didn't surprise me because some asshole commented on my previous post and spoiled it for me. But it was still sad. If only he had taken that 'piece of paper' to the council immediately after he had gotten it from King Robert. But I guess when he found out Joffery was the son of the 'twincest' he tried his best to make King Robert's brother king.

 King Robert's death was ridiculous lol, a wild hog!? Really???

 That scene where Little Finger was teaching the hookers how to please men was pretty hot. More scenes like that please!

 Ok so this is the scene that made me say ""WTF!!"". In the season finale [S01E10] there's a scenes with an old man (one of the council members) and a hooker. The old man seems fragile, weak and has a hunched back. He rambles some bullshit, then the hooker leaves the room. Then all of a sudden the old man gets up and starts stretching and flexing like he's 21! He didn't look old at all. Then he tides up and acts like an old man as he is about to leave the room. 

Can someone please tell me what was going on with that old man? Is he pretending to be old? Whyy?????

#My Favorite Characters

1. Little Finger - lol I don't remember his real name (i think it was something something Baelish) so I just call him Little Finger. This dude is really smart and I think he'll be one of the guys that'll be hard to kill.

2. Jon Snow - I'm pretty sure he's the star of this show. 

3. Aria Stark - The tom boy. I don't know....i just like her

This post portrays how (I believe) Roose Bolton will meet his despise. Wine. Perpetrator: Petr Baelish. Why? Well duh, he set up the Red Wedding along with Walder Frey to take control as Warden of the North. 

First, you think, they would bring back LSH from the books at the beginning of the S6 with the one-eyed man and Thoros of Myr bringing her back as Lady Stoneheart. The likeliness of this happening is slim, IMO. If they were to bring back LSH they would have already, and her main purpose would be to kill all Lannisters, Freys, and Boltons. Buuuuut I have a feeling that they are saving resurrection for someone else, and I think we all know who that is.... cough cough... Jon Stark.

Second; It has been shown three times in the show Roose rejecting wine from servants because ""it dulls the senses."" So why would he accept wine from Petr for? Well Lord Baelish does have A LOT of power right now as Lord of the Vale, he did deliver him Sansa Stark (the believed to be last child of Eddard), he did have a major roll in the killing of Joffrey Barratheon, why wouldn't they celebrate as Petr devises a false plan that probably has to do with Roose gaining a lot of money, or a huge army, or a lot of power; all to get Sansa Stark back (Ramsay, in my theory, has died, leading to why Roose is drinking). They make a plan, and as Lord Baelish always does, celebrates with a toast. The two begin drinking more and more, and Roose is finally drunk (after 1 glass because he is a lightweight, let's be honest), and does not suspect Baelish of anything. So when Petyr rises as Roose babbles about something in a drunken stupor. 

All of a sudden, Roose doesn't feel the fingers at the tips of his hands, then his toes, then his legs and arms all together. He looks up at Lord Baelish, confused since they had then made two different deals that strengthened the Bolton family. All of a sudden, the sly smile of Petyr turns into a menacing glare. He pours the wine from his glass (that he never sipped from in case the glasses got mixed up) and tells Roose how he has paralyzed him for 20 minutes. Just long enough for him to feel the pain that Petyr felt when he heard of...... Lady Stoneheart, aka Cat Stark. And not for the first time, Petyr gives one of the best acting and influential scenes of the season, and affirming to everyone, a man that goes from Rags to Riches is not to be f*cked with.",17,2,False,self,,,,,

His character still baffles me after 4 seasons and rewatching all his scenes. I just don't understand what he's all about, what he stands for, what he wants, or where he's coming from. 


Sandor is like his brother, huge, fast, strong, and a great fighter, but he was never knighted. Why not? If he was Joffrey's personal bodyguard, one of the best fighters in Westeros, competed in tournaments, why was he not a knight? He seems to have the morality and chivalry associated with knights, but at the same time seems to be dismissive of knighthood. He is so loyal as to be called the hound, why was he never rewarded? He had a cool helmet, but the rest of his armor seems to be shoddy and you can see the same dents/scratches in his armor from episode 1 all the way until his death. He only has plate armor on his shoulders, the rest is ragged looking chainmail and studded leather. Was he never paid well or given credit for anything? He doesn't seem to be greedy, or really want gold. He tries to sell Arya only so he can buy passage to Essos to become a sellsword. He didn't steal anything from King's Landing before leaving, so money doesn't really seem to be a big motivator for him. He seems to only want what he needs for basic survival. 


But that is the contradiction, because he also doesn't seem to enjoy killing people, as good as he is at it. He only killed the Lannister soldiers in the tavern because he was attacked. He doesn't smile after winning the match in ~~the Hand's Tournement in season 1~~ Joffrey's Nameday Tournement. He shows little to no emotion when he saves Sansa from the rioters. Yet he tells Tyrion he didn't save Sansa on Tyrion's orders, so why did he do it? He tells Sansa killing is the best thing ever, but was that really the reason he did it? Again, that is something that would be more fitting for his brother, Gregor to say. Sandor doesn't seem to be cruel, malevolent, or malicious, but he did some bad things, like killing the butcher's boy. He didn't abuse Arya except when she tried to stab him with Needle, and didn't even punish her for trying to kill him with a rock to the head. 


From the show we have a little insight to his emotions when he tells of how his brother burned his head, but other than that there's not much else. We know based on his childhood that he's deathly afraid of fire, but was that the sole reason he left Joffrey at the Blackwater? What changed in that one instant where he gave up his unwavering loyalty? It just doesn't seem rational. But of the 2 Cleganes, he is the more rational and moral of the brothers. When Arya asked him what he'd do if he saw his brother again, he basically said he would do nothing. Wouldn't having such a traumatic childhood predispose him to being a pyschopath like Gregor? He seems to have no interest in money, power, women, land, or anything, really. 


Even his death seems to be out of place. He was solidly beaten by Brienne, so why did he grab a Valeryian Steel blade with his bare hands? He's not a knight so he has no honor to protect. He has no money or motivation to protect. Why does he risk horrible injury to his hands, his most valuable resource, when he could have surrendered? If survival was his goal, grabbing Oathkeeper like that was a dumb move.

Imagine unstoppable multiple limbed behemoths clad in armor, undead siege engines and naval vessels unhindered by stamina, fear, or exposure. If it's true that Qyburn reanimated the Mountain into an undead thrall with limited experience and a little time, what have the Walkers done with their dark knowledge over the millennia? We've seen the undead horses, heard of undead bears, what if they can also reanimate the dead tissue of trees? The possibilities are endless.

No Sack stat, and half my Division Names died because of the ""&amp;"" Character. ""Link!"" Comment below will take you to the new, Proof-read League. Cheers


So last season I tried out creating some ESPN Fantasy Football Leagues that were heavy on the Fantasy side. On of them being a Game of Thrones themed league. I had a lot of fun, but few people(like 5/16) stayed active in the league during the course of the season. I was wondering if anyone here would be interested.

The League: ""Game of Thrones""

The league motto is ""Valar Morghulis"" so naturally the Password for entry is ""**Valar Dohaeris**""

Draft is Tentatively Scheduled for August 5th

The league is set up for ""War"" style football matchups with 24 players playing for each team in a given week. Army Sized Rosters. This includes 11 Offensive, 11 Defensive, a Kicker &amp; a Punter. There is also an adequately sized bench and an IR for the important players you can't afford to lose to an injury. 

The Scoring is a bit wild but not anything crazy. One great day by an individual can turn the tide of the battle, but at the end of the day it's a team sport. Players can go negative as well, but only on a very bad day.

There is an automatic 8 point bonus regardless of position for a TEAM victory by that Player's franchise on Sunday. Players will also incur a 5 deduction if their team should lose their game. After all, you play to win the game.  There are 3 point homefield advantages. &amp; Should you gain playoff homefield it will grow to 5.

You must win your Westerosi Distinction to make the Playoffs, so only 4 Teams will advance. Champions from The North, The Riverlands &amp; Westerlands, The Vale, &amp; The Crownlands will clash in Weeks 16 &amp; 17 to Decide who should sit the Iron Throne! I've already filled one of the Vale spots, So anyone who joins can expect to see The Lynderly LumberJacks of Snakewood on the Battlefield come Fall.

Anyways, in closing Sorry for posting ""Sports Stuff"" on this Sub, but it is postseason(har), and these are the dog-days of the Sub till the Winds of Winter Release Date Drops. I hope at least a couple people (15 to be precise) will be interested in keeping A Song of Fire &amp; Ice active in our minds through the fall over some NFL games.

If we peace together what we know and have speculated on so far, I suspect we'll discover Howland Reed was the ""Samwell Tarly"" of Ned Stark's group of companions, more of a thinker than a fighter.  This is a man who was easily disarmed and bullied by three squires.

Here's my guess: Howland Reed knew/found out the Knight of the Laughing Tree was Lyanna Stark.  When Ned puts together his rescue party to save Lyanna from her captivity, Howland volunteers (depsite not being a fighter), because Lyanna once selflessly fought for him.

At the Tower of Joy, the fight between Ned's rescue party and the three Kingsguard holding Lyanna ultimately comes down to Ned &amp; Howland versus Arthur Dayne, the most skilled of the Kingsguard.

I'm betting Ned is immobilized by Arthur, and in a ""Samwell Tarly vs. The White Walker"" type of moment, Howland slays Arthur Dayne.  Howland, a man once bullied by squires, kills the greatest Kingsguard, saving Ned Stark and freeing Lyanna.

Howland and Ned then enter the tower and find Lyanna dying, with an infant.  Howland is witness to Ned promising to raise the child as his own, so the baby won't be in danger as a Targaryen.

I think when Jon Snow comes into contact with Howland Reed, Howland will tell Jon all of this, and we'll see it as a flashback, which is what the Tower of Joy shooting location is currently being used to create. ",68,63,False,self,,,,,

by getting Lysa to poison Jon Arryn, then write to Catelyn that the Lannisters did it, Baelish was able to cause first the enmity between Stark and Lannister, and ultimately the War of the 5 Kings, which in turn created a power vacuum into which Baelish could step. Once Jon Arryn was dead, and the Starks were made to believe the Lannisters did it, Baelish figured that King Robert would only trust another northman, Ned Stark.....and so the plot moved ahead.

Some back story first: she had surgery on her nose due to an old injury that didn't heal properly and has the usual bandages on her face, she still has some stitches and her nose needs more recovery, so her reaction was worse due to this.

She could not believe it of course and hates everybody, cannot believe the pervasion and started crying and hyperventilating. After that, her nose started bleeding and she is now taking a shower cause her clothes were stained with blood. She's unsure if she will be able of dealing with this amount of pain and anger as to continue watching the show, but right now, she needs a break lol.

She is also super sad about Jon leaving Ygritte and likes her, oh episode S4E9 will be a sad one too. (It was huge for me too, i cried Ygritte a lot lol )

ps: English is not my first language, just in case :D

edit: she needs plugs in her nose to stop the bleeding lol",7,4,False,self,,,,,

It's the only cat she had yet to catch, refers to him as a devil, and says that one of the gold cloaks told her ""That's the real king of the castle...older than sin and twice as mean."" And he stole a quail right out of Tywin's hands..!  

Anyway, later on in the book when Varys visits Ned while he's locked in the dungeons below the Red Keep, he tells a little tale.. ""Rhaenys was a child too. Prince Rhaegar's daughter. A precious little thing, younger than your girls. She had a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you know? I always wondered what happened to him. Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her door."" 

I'm sure I'm not the first to stumble across this but it's a pretty cool little tidbit that I didn't catch on my first time through! 

Tywin is the one who laid the bodies of Rhaegar's children out on the floor, and we get the snippet that it's the same cat and it messed with Tywin.

It didn't seem like clever writing to me. I don't think I've ever heard a more thinly veiled metaphor.

##1.05 - ""The Wolf and the Lion""

* Directed By: Brian Kirk
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 15, 2011

Ned refuses to participate in Robert's plan to assassinate the pregnant Daenerys Targaryen, and resigns as Robert's Hand as a result, much to Robert's anger. Catelyn and Tyrion (who she has taken as her prisoner) arrive at her sister Lysa's home in the Eyrie. News of Tyrion's capture reaches King's Landing where Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother, demands answers from Ned. A vengeful Jaime fights Ned until his man stabs Ned in the leg from behind. Jaime then goes to the Eyrie to save his brother. Meanwhile, Viserys confronts his sister Daenerys when Viserys gets jealous over his sister's power over the Dothraki.

##1.06 - ""A Golden Crown""

* Directed By: Daniel Minahan
* Story By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Teleplay By: Jane Espenson and David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 22, 2011

While practice riding a horse with his specially designed saddle, Bran is captured by a group of wildlings (humans who live north of the wall), but is rescued by Robb and Theon. Ned is left in guard of the Iron Throne while the King goes to hunt, and learns the secret left by Jon Arryn. Joffrey and Sansa reconcile. Angered by Drogo's disrespect and his failure to uphold his end of their bargain, Viserys threatens Daenerys, and in response, Drogo kills Viserys by pouring molten gold on his head.

Thought of a wild theory today,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3dw6iz/tvs6theory_thought_of_a_wild_theory_today/,kenny6138,1437354728,"So in the beginning of season 6 I think it will open with a POV of Arya's wolf Nymera (under Arya's control because she is allegedly a warg in the books) running its blood thirsty pack. Soon, things will get blurry and Bran will appear to Ayra.

He will tell her about the events that took place on the wall and what happened to Jon, and maybe even something about his parentage. Anyways, since Arya has gotten very good at lying she will lie to Sexy Jesus about speaking to the Many Faced God. And use that as some means to an end to go on her assignation spree across westeros.


Side note: couldn't Bran be the Many Faced God? I say this because he is a warg and he has warged into Hodor which would give him more than one face. If you include animals that is a lot of faces.

I do not read the books and I'm not well versed in ASOIAF lore, just something I came up with. Thoughts?

I was casually watching youtube videos of different interviews of cast-members, and things like Comic Con panels, etc. and I came across the below video. I have not seen it mentioned anywhere (although it probably has) and thought to spark a discussion on it.

[Taken from Game of Thrones at the Oxford Union](https://youtu.be/TfvVluNxujc?t=1321) March 20th, 2015 is the upload date of the video. Since the 5th season aired in April 2015, this would've been just before that. so the discussions, questions, answers etc. would all be from season 4 and before.

I have it time-stamped at 22:01 so it should play from there. If it does not load, please go to that spot, and watch the next 30 seconds or so.

The context of this point in the video is that an audience member asked the question, ""If you could be any character, which one would you choose to be?""

now, the point of my posting this, is Kit Harrington answers he'd want to be a Warg. that's not really a 'spoiler' in itself, as it can only really be interpretted by someone as Kit Harrington's personal opinnion on who he'd want to be. But after the laughter dies down from his poorly-worded statement (or cleverly worded, if he was going for a laugh) we hear Daniel Brett Weiss say ""Two words for you, Season Six.""

Now immediately as I heard that, I paused the video to come write this post. I watch this subreddit fairly frequently, and read through *most* comments I see on threads, and I've seen nothing about this. People going every witch way saying ""John Snow is dead, he's not coming back"" or talking about Kit being in the payroll payraise for season 6 and 7, etc.

If I had to take a guess, I'd put the tin-foil on and agree that John Snow is coming back, but maybe not as John Snow.",3,1,False,default,,,,,

I know it's not as well-explained in the show as it is in the books, but the MFG seems pretty clear-cut to me, as far as deities go, and the answers to everyone's questions about who or what the MFG actually is are answered in an off-hand comment in S1E6, as far as I'm aware.

Is there something about the way the MFG and the Faceless Men are shown/explained in the show that would lead one to these other conclusions? Are they just not explained well enough onscreen? Or is it something else? I've been curious about this since about midway through the last season.

With many fans believing the show will be limited to two more seasons, I think there's merit in discussing another storyline.
I think it would be great to have a spinoff series nearly as long as Game of Thrones, or a 2-4 hour movie covering Aegon's conquest 300 years before ASOIAF/GoT.
It is a rich story that could be told in a movie, but as much of the lore was generated within the existing ASOIAF texts and additional supplements like A World of Ice and Fire, a series that allows more creative direction while following the general framework already laid out for this plot would be great.

Some highlights:
Starts with a the dream-like flashback visions of Daenys, of the Targaryen migration with their few allied houses (like Velaryon) to Dragonstone, and then cutting back to see the volcanic fury that Doomed Valyria.
The first scene opens with Aegon the Conquerer in the room with the large wooden table-map of Westeros, with his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys.
Would cover over the duration of the series/film the founding of King's Landing as the Aegonfort, the taking of Storms End and the beginning of the Baratheon line with Orys Baratheon the conquering of the Reach and House Gardener, the destruction of Harrenhal, the difficulty in Dorne, feature the three dragons Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar, and overall, the reorganization of Westeros into the Seven Kingdoms.

Should this not prove enough, as a series, each season after the first two could advance the timeline down through Aegon's decendants' reign. These would feature notable locations like Queens Crown and the Gift, New Gift, War of the Ninepenny Kings, The Blackfyre rebellions, Summerhall, and eventually many notable figures from GoT before we knew them, like:
Robert Baratheon, Aerys the Mad King, Rhaegar, Elia Martell, a younger Tywin Lannister, Brynden Rivers, Aemon and Aegon as young siblings, and notable Kingsguard and of the time from Aegon V to the end of War of the Usurper.",5,16,False,self,,,,,

Obviously most of that has just been trying to reconcile what I have seen, just as I did when I watched Ned die having not yet read any of the books. Now, years later, as an avid book reader, I have done some thinking about what was shown in those last two episodes and a possible redemption for the absolute shitstorm that was Stannis' character assassination in them. 

  Being that D&amp;D indicated that Shireen's burning had come from GRRM himself and will possibly (probably) occur in the books as a result of that, I raise the following theory. We see Breanne swing Oathkeeper at Stannis, but the angle of the shot and how she screamed made it seem as though she did not our could not kill him. Could it be possible that she does not kill Stannis but instead elects to take him to the Wall for judgement, perhaps in company with Theon and Sansa (here I will apologize and say that Stannis' end was the only portion of episode 10 that I have seen, and I know of Theon and Sansa's escape but am not sure of where they went)? Meanwhile, Melisandre returns to the wall knowing full well that Stannis would be killed in the battle of Winterfell after his men abandoned him. Upon arriving, she uses her magic to attempt to resurrect ""Azor-Ahai."" 
   This is where Shireen burning in the books would come into play. In the books, Melissandre would know of Stannis' apparent defeat from the Pink Letter, and would elect to burn Shireen to bring him back to life, where he could not voice his opinion against it. In both scenarios (show and books), as Stannis is both not dead and not Azor-Ahai, Jon Snow is revived instead. When Stannis returns to the Wall (with Breanne in the show, some other way in the books), he is furious at Melisandre for burning Shireen and kills her. Her story purpose to guide Stannis and to resurrect Jon Snow is fulfilled, and Stannis fans can be given a happy conclusion to his story arc when he is accepted into the Night's Watch as penitence for his crimes by the resurrected Jon Snow.

  Please note, this is mostly just emotional grasping at straws that the Mannis will yet have some happy ending, but I thought it would be worthy of discussion.",1,1,False,default,,,,,

If this means anything at all, I think it would mean Sandor has a role in the fight against the White Walkers (even if he only kills wights or whatever), and I don't think it could ever mean Sandor is Azor Ahai, I just don't see it happening.

I remember watching the bathtub scene with Brienne and completely swaying to team Jaime. He saved all of King's Landing. Pushing Bran out the window in the pilot didn't help his cause, but since then I feel like he's become one of the best characters. Also, I don't think people take note on how risky releasing Tyrion was on his part. The one bad scene I can think of since the pilot was that Cersei rape scene, which I will admit made me think twice.

Across the narrow sea, Danny will somehow win over the Dothraki and convince them to join her forces. Since shes fully on board with her Westeros invasion now shes going to pick up whats left of her Army including her knew horse riding buddies and set ship to Dorne, where she can easily barter an alience with the Martells considering their long list of shared enemies. From there I can't imagine it being hard for her to set something up with the Tyrells given their current relationship with the Lanisters. This would give her access of their giant army (I believe it's the largest in Westeros) as well as all of their riches and resources.

My question is, after it is revealed that she poisoned Jon, why didn't she lend Cat some of her men in the first place? I don't think it would've made a huge difference in the end, it's just something I've been wondering. She didn't need to hold all of her men with the Eyrie being nearly impossible to attack. Was she just being a selfish bitch or was there any other reason why she wouldn't help her sister? The only other thing I could think of would be because she had to go along with her play that the Lannisters were behind Jons death, but even then, did she need all of her men?

Take the Mad King Aerys for example. He wasn't crazy when he began his rule, and although he became ever more suspicious when he got older it was the Defiance of Duskendale that really pushed him to become 'mad'. So basically his coin landed on the right side, it was through whatever he went through during the Defiance that really tore into his sanity.

Also look at Viserys, many people say that he was crazy, y'know given the Targaryen trait of madness. But I'd say he also acted abusive and 'mad' because he lived through the death of almost his entire family, and even after escaping to Dragonstone his mother died after birthing Danaerys. So his father betrayed by his own kingsguard, his brother killed by Bobby B, his nephews and nieces brutally murdered by a mountain, his sister-in-law raped and then killed by said mountain, and then his mother dying giving birth to his sister as the cherry on top. That would sort of fuck anyone up, but I wouldn't say he was 'mad' from the get go.

I personally think, that Rhaegar was one of the Targ's to land on the crazy side. He spent most of his time reading and playing the harp, not caring much about anything. He then reads some random book, and decides that he can create the 'Prince that was Promised'. If that's not crazy I don't know what is. And this whole idea of him being special almost killed his entire family with the 'kidnapping' of Lyanna Stark. I think the guy was definitely bat shit.  And I have another idea about Dany being mad too, because I think it would just be entertaining to see a crazy person who has dragons that they control. 

So yeah I could be totally wrong, but that's just my take on that. ",15,21,False,self,,,,,

As old as the Children of the Forest, who wandered Westeros in the days before the First Men. They should of been the hammer of the Wilding's army, to truly bring fear to the Crows... but where are they? In the show, we only see three (their names are, Dongo the one with the rocket bow, Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, the giants king, and Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun, ""What the fuck are you looking at""), and never see any others just wandering around in the background. Why?

In a meta sense, it's to expensive. The Giants of the books are big, stupid, naked Ape like creatures that walk around on their knuckles and use giant clubs. There is more of them, because in a book saying ""there are three giants"" costs the same as saying ""there are thirty giants"" (barring ink costs for that extra letter). The show opted to make more ""traditional"" giants, partially so the audience knows these are giants and not yehtis, and partially because make a good look ape walk would of required even more CGI. The giants we have were very expensive. They took the two tallest people in Britain, built the expensive suits to fit the actors, then increased the actor's size further with CGI, along with all kinds of camera angle and filming tricks. All that costs a *lot*. They were going to have a fight scene between Mag Mar and the six Crows during the attack on Castle Black, but it was scrapped as it would of just cost so much.

However, I do believe there is an in story explanation for this, a reason why we only see three, they were the only giants left.

In the North, in it's near perpetual winter, food is always scarce. There is very little land where any agriculture will grow, so it falls to a hunter gatherer ""society."" Because of the Square Cube law, Giants require a lot more food than a human. A giant is about twice as tall and wide as a normal human, but has somewhere between six and EIGHT times the total volume. So, a giant would need at *least* six-eight times as much food as any other wildling. So, the giants population must have been very small even before the White Walkers came back.

Compounding this further is the fact the giants must of lived very far North. The Night's Watch had never seen a giant before Mance Rayder marched south, and regarded them as pure myths. So, this would mean their is even less food to hunt and gather, so they would have an even lower population.

So, we have a small group of giants, maybe as low as one hundred living giants at one time, living as they had for thousands of years, when the White Walkers return. While Obsidian and Valyrian steel are the only thing we know of that is capable of killing the White Walkers, being stepped on by a giant will ruin anyone's day. In either case, once the White Walkers had gained any kind of notable army, they targeted the Giants first, either because they are huge menaces that are threat both to scores of Wights or even potentially the White Walker's themselves, or they were just so far North that the Giants were the first in the Dead's way.

The Giants fought hard, but they were eventually slaughtered. Only three managed to survive, and none of them are female. No matter what happened, Dongo, Mag Mar, and Wun Wun would be the last generation of giants, the last to carry blood that existed before the time of the first men. And two of them died trying desperately to help the humans get south of the wall, so mankind would have a chance to continue on.

So, Wun Wun is the LAST Giant. When he dies, no one will sing the giants songs in that ancient tongue. Even if the living win the War for the Light, the Giant's light will soon burn out for good.",12,14,False,self,,,,,

How will the Jon Snow theory be revealed? The only person that knew the truth about his parents (Ned Stark) has been killed. At first I thought 'oh Lady Melisandre will do something because as we all know, fire cannot kill a dragon' but then I remembered when Jon killed the walker at Castle Black, the fire burnt his hand so I thought that could be risky. So I was sitting there for at least 10 minutes thinking how it would be and who would reveal it. Who were the only two people to survive the events at The Tower of Joy? Ned Stark (now deceased) and Howland Reed. Howland Reed was there when Lyanna past away, he was also a very close friend of Neds, Lyanna Stark also saved him from the 3 squires who were bullying him and since then they were also good friends so he wouldn't have left straight away. He then travelled north and stayed in Greywater Watch, whilst Ned marched on to Winterfell, and nobody has heard or seen anything from him since. I think that in one of the books Howland Reed will appear and reveal everything, I don't know the particular situation in which these events will unfold but even George R.R. Martin has said that we will meet Howland Reed. I know what you're thinking ""If Howland Reed knew this then why didn't he reveal it sooner?"" Well, that's simple, the Reeds live in Greywater Watch a castle that constantly moves amongst the swamps so it's harder for enemies to find, it's well known that the only people who can find it are the Crannogmen themselves, this also means that ravens can't be sent there. This means the only knowledge they have of the outside world are the green dreams Jojen has. As we know Jojen and Meera Reed are sent to Winter fell by Howland to declare their loyalty to the King of The North. So with all this isolation it is very hard for Howland Reed to gain information and act quickly. Not only that, once Jojen leaves, he has no way of knowing anything unless he sends out riders. This means he probably knows about Jon joining the Night's Watch but it is unlikely that he knows about the great ranging north, or Jon becoming the Commander of the Night's Watch. I believe Howland Reed is the only man alive that knows of Jon Snows true birth. I believe we will meet him and he will reveal all.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

[This picture in particular](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/e/ec/Twoiaf_battle_of_the_trident.jpg) stands out to me, along with seeing other images of Robert before he was the King.

What if they did a spin-off series of pre-book / pre-show events (such as the Rebellion / Dance of the Dragons, etc) while GRRM finishes the book series up?  I understand that may be a while, but I was just talking with a friend and figured I'd see what you all thought of it and if you thought HBO would ever do something like that (Similar to how Walking Dead is even getting its own spin-off before the main show is even over).

The first being he will be resurrected by the Fire bitch. The second is that he may become a white walker. I just was hit over the head with a third idea.

What if Jon Snow is dead, but sometime in the future Arya assumes his face and body and acts like he has risen from the dead. This may explain the paradox that the creators state that Jon Snow is dead as well as why Kit is travelling to location shoot. While I have no idea why Arya would take on his face, but it is known that the followers of the Many Faced God can take on the image of people that are not even dead (when one of them used Arya's face). Perhaps they can do so with people that they are not near nor have the body of. This would allow Arya to take on Jon's role in the future, though to do what exactly, I have no idea.

I actually like Jon Snow but it drives me nuts how he seems to have so much plot armor. Also I have literally not the faintest amount of doubt that Jon will be coming back to life.

As for Dany I really don't like her. Of all the characters she's the least deserving I consider her asshole brother more deserving than her, why?  Dany gets everything delivered to her with almost no work on her part. Her brother was known as the beggar king and literally carried her on his back his tough life likely added to his madness. Dany on the other hand got set up in a marriage, gets luck and gets a bunch of dragons, then she gets an Army. Dany is shown to be a terrible leader time and time again. 
I will be fair though, she is at least learning a bit but nowhere near fast enough she's too damn naive. The only thing I like about Dany are her advisers especially now with the Tyrion/Spider dream team on her side.



I really want this show to continue to shock rather than evolve into a generic obvious hero saves the day kind of thing.

The Hound bringing down Cersei and the Mountain (HYPE), Dany liberating the world with her dragons, and Jon (after hopefully being resurrected by the Lord of Light) fighting against the White Walkers. 

While I don't know how all this might come together, I thought that this might be an interesting way to think of the ones fighting for the betterment of the realms and against the Others/White Walkers. 

Again, my knowledge of the books is very limited, and this is a theory that I myself am not totally invested in, but I figured it might be interesting enough to share. ",9,12,False,self,,,,,

I have wisely decided for a change that instead of predicting the storylines for a single character next year, I would try and predict all of them (in order) for the first episode at least. And I can try to do more later if people have an interest. So, without further chit chat, here's my complete prediction for the Season 6 premiere (summarised of course, where plot movements seem clunky, just imagine some fucking awesome dialogue to explain it that I didn't have time to write)?

EPISODE ONE: WOLVES IN THE WIND

Olly searches for Jons body, but it is nowhere to be found. He spots Melisandre watching him. He returns to the Hall, where the Nights Watch are eating in silence. Alliser Thorne is sitting in the Lord Commanders seat. Olly explains to Thorne that he believes the Witch stole his body. Thorne orders his men to find her.

Davos is approached during the day by Olly, who attempts to gauge his skills for usefulness at the Wall. Olly explains to Davos that Stannis siege was a failure, and that Davos will be staying at the Wall until arrangements can be made. A heartbroken Davos sits for a moment, and calls after a retreating Olly, saying he can read and write.

Ramsay arrives back in Winterfell after the battle, and prepares to leave to find his hostages after hearing of their escape. However a guard informs him that they killed Myranda in their escape and he looks over her body. Roose tells him not to act rashly and especially not to harm either hostage, but is ignored.

Sansa and Theon run through the snow. They are found by a single horseman, revealed to be Pod. Pod explains that the horse can only carry two people, but when Sansa refuses to abandon Theon (and Pod realises Reeks identity), he steps down off of the horse and lets them take it. He shows them his sword as proof that he has a better chance at survival than them. They ride off in one direction, and he walks in another.

Jaime arrives in Kings Landing. Cersei comes to greet him, but breaks down when she sees Jaime and Bronn carrying Myrcellas corpse. She screams disturbingly loud.

Summer races through the woods. He is suddenly attacked by a bear and pinned down. Bran wakes up screaming. He takes Meera and Hodor and goes searching for Summer. They find him wounded Summer lying in the snow. The bear is dead. 

Bran is taken before the Three-Eyed Raven, who tells him that if Summer had been free from Brans control, he would have known not to wander into bear territory. The Raven begs him to try and warg into other animals, as his attachment to Summer is holding him back. Bran says Summer is easier than other animals. Meera approaches Bran afterwards and asks him to try harder, so that Jojen wont have died in vain.

On the Iron Islands, Balon and Yara Greyjoy are in the Throne Room, awaiting the arrival of Euron Greyjoy. Euron arrives with twenty guards, and tells them that he has returned with a plan to truly claim the North. He is surprised when Balon rejects him, saying that he wishes for the Boltons to leave the North weak and defenceless before they attack. Euron tries to speak, but is silenced. He angrily offers his brother a thinly veiled threat and leaves the room. Yara looks troubled.

Arya rides in a carriage with Jaqen, blind. She keeps asking him questions but is ignored. Jaqen takes her out of the carriage on the side of a canal. He tells her that a girl needs to kill a man to be redeemed. Arya asks Jaqen for a mans name. Jaqen gives her the name Mace Tyrell. Arya screams after him begging for help. Before leaving, Jaqen tells her to find Izembaro. He then leaves her screaming alone in the streets.

Later Cersei sits and looks at Jaime during a Small Council meeting. Kevan Lannister is also present. When Jaime is finished recounting his story, Cersei demands that they send a fleet to Dorne on the morrow. Kevan dismisses her ramblings, and announces he will sent a letter requesting that the culprits head be brought to them. Cersei is not satisfied, but Kevan helpfully reminds her that she is in no position to be waging wars. She is awaiting trial, and her position on the Council is entirely honorary. Kevan requests that Jaime escort him to the Tower of the Hand. Cersei looks at Jaime pleadingly as he leaves.

Kevan requests that Jaime escort Margaery and Loras Tyrell back to Highgarden with a handful of trusted men, in order to bypass Cerseis inevitable blockades, once Kevan can get them released from the High Sparrows clutches. Jaime says he will have to take time to think about making a commitment to another quest. Kevan informs him that as a member of the Kingsguard, he has little choice.

Tyrion, sitting on Daenerys Throne, listens to a Red Priestess named Kinvara. He mocks her, and is reluctant to take her religion on board. Varys convinces him to do otherwise, as a large portion of the common folk follow the Lord of Light. Tyrion reluctantly offers Kinvara an honorary place on the Small Council, but has Varys and Grey Worm keep tabs on her at all times. 

Later the Nights Watch have a funeral for Jon Snow. Alliser Thorne speaks false words for him. Thorne notices the Wildlings, led by Tormund, have arrived at the funeral and are staring at him silently.

Melisandre attempts to flee Castle Black in the middle of the night, but is caught by Davos. After a heated argument, Melisandre convinces Davos to accompany her by revealing that Rhllor has stopped contacting her. As the two flee, Melisandre stops into the kennels, petting Ghost and whispering something into his ear, before releasing him. Davos asks Melisandre what she said, and Melisandre says she told him his name. Ghost is seen walking away, and we get a glimpse of his now bright blue eyes.

During the night, Bran unintentionally wargs into Summer, who is seized by two Children of the Forest, too weak to resist. Summer is put before the Raven, who speaks directly to Bran, saying that this is the only way to develop his abilities. He apologises, looking genuinely upset, and kills Summer. Bran wakes up, but is deathly silent. 

Later Balon is walking across a bridge alone when he is approached by Euron. Euron seems calm, and recounts stories of the legendary old Iron Kings, who would always attack and conquer, no matter the risk. He then tells Balon a parable of their childhood that ends with Balon saying that he will be the fiercest king of them all. Euron then explains that he is saving Balons crumbling reign before he becomes known as a craven king. Euron then pushes Balon off of the bridge, moments after he realises what is happening.

* Arya will become a crazy beautiful woman that everybody is going to want to marry, but she will tell them all to fuck off.

* Khal Drogo is going to start listening to Dany and do whatever she says and help her brother win back the throne.

EDIT:

* Also: Tyrion and Cersei developing a strong, productive relationship and Cersei taking all of Tyrion's advices.


She is also convinced that Viserys was raping Dany, because that's what 'waking the dragon' meant. She might be right on that one.

They did not do this our of hatred of Jon and the wildlings but rather because they were sworn to an oath. so why does this matter?

I think this is proof that Jon snow is either alive or will be resurrected by Mellisandra the same way Thoros resurrected Beric Dondarrion (they all worship the same God so why not have the same Resurrection ability). 

my reasoning for this being proof is based on the assumption that in the grand scheme of things, the wildlings that settled the wall will play a part in fighting off the white walkers. According to the book, the alliance between the wildlings and the watch would still be in place after Jon's death. However, according to the show, Jon's death would surely cancel the alliance and the watch would find some way to get rid of them. Only Jon being surviving or being resurrected would keep the alliance alive.

First of all, burning people and using King's blood hasn't really done anything besides the first shadow assassin. You can point to the leeches, but it's pretty certain that Joffrey and Robb were going to die anyway, and Balon is still pimpin' in the Iron Islands. Burning Shireen cleared away the snow a little bit, but led to all Stannis' men deserting him. Melisandre could easily look at all this blood magic and realize that it didn't do much. In fact the burning of horses by Sir Twenty of House Goodmen and the burning of Shireen have only harmed her in recent episodes. It seems that the power of fire has turned against her.

Second, during her visit with the Brotherhood Without Banners, she seems amazed that Thoros is able to revive Dondarrion multiple times. She almost seems in awe. Seeing as her whole cause is about life and light, and saving the realm's life from the undead, I could easily see her turning her cause to reviving people (including Jon, the real Warrior of Light being central to her redemption) instead of burning and killing them. If her cause is about fighting for the living, why burn so many people when you can instead use the Lord's power of revival? It gives the Brotherhood plotline a whole lot more weight as well, which I wasn't really all crazy about when it first happened. It seemed kind of random, maybe just as a foil to Melisandre and more tragedy to Arya, but now I could see Mel learning from it.

Third, and most importantly, her false choice of Stannis in general is interesting. She seemed 100% certain that Stannis is the true Warrior of Light during her entire character arc. His destruction, mainly resulting from her ways, causes true uncertainty and pain in her, as seen from her face when she returns to Castle Black. Everything that she has believed that last few seasons, the formation of her character, has been a lie and the wrong path to follow. 

She's facing an identity crisis, and I really can't see her returning to the old ways that she followed on this false path. She seems to be leaning towards a redemption arc (which I really hope, because her character is really cool), but at the very least she seems to be headed for some change.

Anyone have anything else to add to this, or refute it?

However many of you might not know that books 4 (A Feast for Crows) and 4 (A Dance with Dragons) do not follow one another.. Those two novels in reality run in sync with eachother, each picking up where ""A Storm of Swords"" left off, and each novel dealing containing different sets of characters.   

One of the biggest issues many readers have with AFFC are the absences of several characters in that book... Tyrion, Jon Snow, Dany... none of which appear in AFFC and instead focuses on characters in Dorne, Braavos, The Iron Islands, and Kings Landing.. those missing characters are, in turn, the focus of ADWD, and cover what those characters are doing during the same time period.. 

However some astute fans after the release of ADWD came up with a ""combined reading order""  that mixes chapters from both novels into what serves as one massive novel (as the original intent of ADWD over a decade ago).  

I bring this up as a PSA to forewarn new readers who might be thinking taking this approach is right up their alley and will be wanting to do this after they have cleared ASOS.... But before you do a bit of warning...  Be careful of a couple of the combined chapter orders out there.  Without spoiling there are a few cliffhangers and/or reveals either throughout or right at the end of AFFC that would be spoiled before you got to them by early chapters in ADWD if you were to to a combined order.  Most of the major combined orders, namely the main one posted on ""Boiled Leather"" arrange the chapter by chronology, what happens earlier in one book comes first... but in doing so you can have ADWD spoiling a later chapter in AFFC before you get to it..  Boiled leather's main combined read is fantastic... but as a re-read option only, and not to new readers. 

So how do you avoid this?  The best option, sadly is to read the novels in the published order.. AFFC followed by ADWD.. It will mean that some of your favorite characters will disappear for an entire novel, but it's still the best option.... And at least you don't have to wait 11 years to find out what happens in the books to some of those characters.  This would be my recommendation for new readers. 

But still, say you want to truck ahead and knock out AFFC, and ADWD combined.. well, there are still are some options.. Boiledleather.com does offer an alternative ""new reader friendly"" combined order, which can be seen [Here](http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-reader-friendly-combined-reading-order-for-a) (Chapter title spoilers in link).  It's an okay option (I have never tried this order out), but the biggest downside is the chapters DO NOT follow a strict chronology, and you will be flipping back and forth not only in time, but you will forced to skip and revisit several chapters following this route...kind of taxing in order to keep everything organized...But on the plus side, those big reveals/twists from AFFC will not be spoiled by chapters from ADWD this way.

I really want to get a Stark decoration for my dorm but I've been having trouble finding a poster that fits my wants. 

I'd prefer a minimalist approach, with just the sigil, house words, and maybe house name but this is very changeable if I like what I see.

I really want it to be pretty large. Like 2 ft/60cm minimum height. 

$30-$40 is probably the most that I can spend on it.

The Starks have history with the White Walkers. Old Nan suggests that their King is of Stark origin and is named Bran. Bran the Builder maybe?

Everyone seems to be set on Jon being the Lord of Lights champion, but honestly the red god doesn't seem like such a great guy. To me he seems evil. I honestly believe Dany is much more likely to turn out to be an evil murderous queen who would fit in perfectly with the red god.

After a long summer, Azor Ahai will be reborn amidst smoke and salt wielding the flaming sword Lightbringer to defend the world from R'hllor's nemesis, the Other. 

We all know the White Walkers are coming. Winter is here in the North and it is coming to the rest of Westeros fast. Dany has had visions of reaching the Iron Throne during winter. She wants that thrones. She doesn't want to leave the slaves defensless, but the foreshadowing is strong in that she might just destroy Meereen and all the Masters along with it. 

If Dany is the Azor Ahai where does that leave Jon? Perhaps on the other side of the fence? Jon would never join the White Walkers, though! Maybe, or maybe he doesn't know the true story. Maybe their story was covered up and removed from history?

Myself and a friend were wondering where the next season would take us and as we started laughing about the loan the Iron Bank had made to Stannis and how that would be defaulted on,  this lead us to discuss the remaining standing armies of Westeros.  The best we could come up with was the Bolton Army @ Winterfell and a possible army of wildlings should someone resurrect from their last job as a Night Watch pin cushion.  That's when the theory hit us.  We know Little Finger is always playing the Game of Thrones about 3 moves ahead of everyone else and it dawned on us that the Eyrie still has a full standing army.  With the battle between the Boltons and Stannis, as one sided as it appeared, it still would have caused some casualties on the Bolton side preparing them for what we believe will be Little Fingers next move.  As we have been told ""the North Remembers"" and will be happy to rally around Little Finger as he marches in with the Eyrie army and frees the daughter of Eddard allowing him to marry her and unite the North behind himself as the new Warden of the North, rebuilding Winterfell and ultimately putting himself in a great position to then subsequently march south on King's Landing to take the Iron Throne for himself.

However this may be the first time in a Telltale game that I make a separate file to see the other choice. 

My secret dream is for them to make this game into a live action miniseries, I'd love to see Asher and Rodrick irl.

At over half a million subscribers, \/r/gameofthrones is the largest tv-show-based community on all of Reddit.  We grow larger every year as both Reddit and Game of Thrones continue to increase in popularity, and as this subreddit grows, so do its moderation needs.  In order to keep this community in line with its [original purpose and values](/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy) (a place for fans of all different kinds to safely and maturely discuss the books and show without fear of spoilers), we are now accepting applications for new moderators of \/r/gameofthrones.

The challenges of moderating a story-based subreddit are unlike other types of communities and include dealing with issues like spoilers and leaks as well as requiring a certain level of fandom.  Combining the moderation needs of a large default-sized sub with those of a story-based sub makes for a unique environment that can prove challenging for even the most experienced moderators.

Before you apply to become a moderator of \/r/gameofthrones, the following statistics will attempt to give you a sense of what that moderation entails so that you are aware of what you may be getting yourself into:

* \/r/gameofthrones has over 560 thousand subscribers and was growing at an average rate of around 2000 subscribers a day by the end of June this year.

* During the busy season (April-June), \/r/gameofthrones experiences between 1 and 2 million unique views a month.

* On the day of the S5 finale, \/r/gameofthrones had over 530 thousand unique visitors (about the same size as the entire subscriberbase), over 5 million pageviews and over 7000 new subscriptions on a single day.

* On episode nights, new posts are made at a rate of about 3-5 posts every 20 seconds, and that rate continues well through the wee hours of the night into the following morning and day.

* The two official discussion threads posted on premiere nights alone garnered an average of around 12 thousand comments during Season 5.  The threads had over 25 thousand comments combined for the final week.  These comments are made over the course of 3 days, with the majority of them coming in the hours immediately following each episode premiere.

* The majority of \/r/gameofthrones' subscribers are US-based, but approximately 50% of its users live in other countries with various peak traffic hours.

* The 5 most active moderators in \/r/gameofthrones averaged over 3000 moderator actions a month (100 actions a day), not including answering modmail, during the busy season.  Over 18000 non-bot moderator actions were performed in the month of May.

* Feel free to view the publically available [traffic statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/about/traffic/) for \/r/gameofthrones for more detailed information.

**If you are still interested in becoming a moderator for \/r/gameofthrones and feel like you can contribute to the team, please [fill out and submit your application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d6xAa6YHQFYyqDkq6dZa9lFqv-6Ylyb84MK2BEVm7Cw/viewform).**  We are using a Google Form for easy data collection, but none of your personal information is stored by the form or visible to us.  You also cannot edit your application after you submit, so make sure you fill it out to your own satisfaction the first time.  Please be *especially sure* that you spell your username correctly, as we have no way to contact you otherwise.

---

TL;DR: We need more moderators.  It is not an easy job (during the busy season), but if you want to help us out, please [fill out and submit this application.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d6xAa6YHQFYyqDkq6dZa9lFqv-6Ylyb84MK2BEVm7Cw/viewform)

I've been wondering. Would it not make sense at this point for House Tyrell to assault King Landing or anywhere really? Their army is the largest but with winter coming that seems to be more of a weakness than a boon.

I'm not saying their goal should be to lose whatever battles they choose but a culling of their ranks would help them survive winter. 

Also a side note. Why does House Tyrell only have Loras as an heir? I know in the books he has three brothers but in the show it's only him and his sister which I find incredibly stupid of Mace and his wife.",9,12,False,self,,,,,

**Renly** - Pragmatic ruler who understood the nature of power and of compromise. Would have been a popular ruler and quite fair. On the negative side extremely vain and morally dubious. Corruption would have continued unhindered and the crown would of been bankrupt.

**Stannis** - The true heir once you accept Robert was rightful king and not a usurper. Fair minded king who would of ruled and administered the kingdom well. Difficult to see how the people would of loved him but he would of brought peace to the kingdom. Downside would probably be his willingness to burn his own daughter alive to achieve his goal.

**Robb** - Judging by his father's example he would of been a good king in many ways. He would be fair and even handed. However his whole family seem too politically naive to rule in Kings Landing. He may want to remain King in the North but none of the other candidates would accept this so he would of been in a state of total warfare.

**Baelon** - There is no positive argument to be made for him as far as I can see. I'd love to hear one.

The theory is quiet simple, I think if there are 3 living dragons, there must also be 3 living Targaryens to ride them. Like we saw in the last episodes Maester Aemon died (RIP), but I am saying it has to be 3 young living Targaryens to ride those dragons like the new generation.

The first one is clearly Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, Khaleesi. Like we saw in the latest episode she knows how to ride a dragon if you know what i mean.

I think the second living Targaryen is Jon Snow. We all know or maybe not that Lyanna Stark von kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen. I think Rhaegar Targaryen had sex (maybe was in love with her or just raped her) with Lyanna Stark and the born child is Jon Snow. Eddard Stark went to rescue Lyanna Stark, but she gave him a baby to take care of and died. This baby was Jon Snow. Eddard Stark could not say it was the kid of Lyanna Stark to all the others like Robert Baratheon because he would have killed the baby if he knew it was probably the kid of a Targaryen. So he claimed it was his own son, a bastard.

The third living Targaryen is probably Aegon Targaryen, another son of Rhaegar Targaryen. Aegon is said to be killed like the majority of the Targaryens. I think Varys saved Aegon Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion by switching the babys, he just replaced Aegon Targaryen with another baby and saved Aegon Targaryens life that way. Varys was also the Master of Whisperers during the reign of the Mad King aka. Aerys II Targaryen. It is obvious that he supports the Targaryens, that is why he wants to help Khaleesi. So Aegon is still alive and maybe changed his outer appearances like dyeing his hair not to be discovered, I think Varys still has contact with him because he is the one true Master of Whispers.

Daenerys Targaryen, Jon ""Snow"" Targaryen, Aegon Targaryen

Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3e9mke/spoilers_all_something_odd_i_noticed_about_qyburn/,LBJSmellsNice,1437612661,"I didn't notice at first, but Qyburn is first seen in Harrenhal, one of the few survivors after Gregor Clegane abandons the castle and kills the prisoners. He barely survived himself, being cut at the throat by Gregor's men.

Now, a long while later, he is in service to the queen and tasked with saving the life of Gregor Clegane.

Do you think he remembers what Gregor did to him? Does he care? Is Frankenmountain somehow a form of revenge against Gregor, or did Qyburn actually do what he could for the queen and forget his old troubles?

The fact that Qyburn has brought the mountain back from death after nearly being killed by the man strikes me as really unusual.",52,72,False,self,,,,,

So this begs the question, are the slaves and masters working together against Daenerys now? I find it kind of unusual that they would put aside their differences so easily.

Here's the dictionary definition of psychopath:
a person with a psychopathic personality, which manifests as amoral and antisocial behavior, lack of ability to love or establish meaningful personal relationships, extreme egocentricity, failure to learn from experience, etc.

Here are the traits of a psychopath:
-Uncaring (lack of empathy)
-Shallow emotions
-Irresponsibility
-Insincere speech
-Overconfidence
-Narrowing of attention
-Selfishness
-Inability to plan for the future
-Violence

Viserys
Roose Bolton
Varys

Came away with a few questions right off the bat.
1) In the opening scene we see 3 members of the Nights watch who find a slaughtered group of Wildlings. Posed in a very ritualistic pattern. Not long after the White walkers appear along with the risen dead. Has there been an explanation for the bodies to be placed in such a manner before being risen? Can we assume it was the walkers? Or someone else I dunno ""summoning"" them? 

2) Can the dismembered bodies of the dead be so easily brought back  by the White walkers? One guy gets cleanly decapitated. If that would make it impossible to raise and add him to the army of the dead, then why bother?

3) If the wall is so effective how do Direwolves and individuals get past it?

4) White walkers haven't been seen in thousands of years. Do we have an explanation yet as to why they've suddenly appeared?

I was under the impression that Westeros was kinda like a grossly oversized Britain, but that might have been a false impression used by the accents in the show or the narration of Roy Dotrice...  Essos was kinda like Eastern Europe... except Dorne seems more like it should have been part of Essos rather than Westeros. 

When I first saw the maps I was wondering what the hell a desert was doing in Westeros... and remained puzzled by how utterly out-of-place Dorne looked.

Then it kinda occurred to me that MAYBE... Westeros is actually supposed to be more like North America than Britain... that the Northmen are all supposed to sound Canadian... and the Dornish are Mexicans. 
Maybe in spite of all the misconceptions caused by the relative technology levels and the usual mapping of ""knights in castles"" to ""British accents""...  they're actually all supposed to be speaking in American / Canadian / Mexican accents?

Similarly, I figured the Summer Isles represented Africa, but it makes more sense now to regard them as the Caribbean islands.

He *knows* and admitted that he made a terrible, dumb decision (""my father gave me a choice, and I chose wrong""), and he's paying dearly for it.

The Red Wedding is just around the corner,  and where I was more shocked at its unexpectedness than anything else on the first watch, I'm seriously dreading it now.

I've read a few theories about Melisandre being at the wall to resurrect him, but what if she can't? She hasn't resurrected anyone before, so why would she be able to do it now? Yeah, she has power (she's a shadowbinder) but as far as we know, the only other 'power' she has is her visions. And she fucked that one up too, by needlessly sacrificing Shireen (as-well-as misunderstanding her visions before).

I don't think the mutineers will get away with throwing Jon over the wall and leaving him for the wights - there are still some brothers who are loyal to Jon, at Castle Black. Instead, I think they will try to hide his body. The walkers will then end up destroying the wall and killing everyone at Castle Black. When they find Jon's body, *then* the Night's King will resurrect Jon. What happens after Jon is resurrected.. who knows?



EDIT: u/ZoroarkPKMN has a pretty ~~good~~ interesting theory
&gt;**My theory was that they'll try to burn Jon Snow's body so he doesn't become a White Walker, but his body doesn't burn meaning that he is Targaryen (confirming R+L=J)**, so he leaves with Melisandre and Davos and they all sail to Daenerys. Then Daenerys, Tyrion, and Jon Snow are all together and they can ride dragons and shit.

GRRM makes nothing simple and nothing predictable. I don't think Jon Snow's resurrection will be any different.

Yes, Mel went back to the wall. I think we will see the opening scene of season 6 through Ghost's eyes. He'll witness Mel say the words and kiss Jon Snow. Just as everyone at home is starting to get that satisfied feeling we'll realize nothing happens. Jon still lays dead, unresponsive. Mel is distraught ( maybe kills herself?) and the camera switches back to Ghost with bright blue or violet eyes.

Later, probably not the same episode,  white walkers arrive at the wall. Amidst, the battle and chaos Jon Snow is raised by the night's king. Only, he is not a mindless zombie. His conscious is transferred from ghost and he becomes a self aware white walker, not a mindless wight. Throughout the remainder of the season he gains control of the white walker army. He exacts his revenge on those who stole his home and those that mutinied against him. He leaves the North for Rickon or Bran to seize. Then he returns north of the wall to rule as the night's king and begins a new pact with the Starks in the North.

There are, for once, two similar prophecies told by two completely different characters pertaining to the same character. Of these are, Mirri Maz Duur's  told to Dany in AGOT/S1 (""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."") and the prophecy Quaithe told Dany in ACOK (but not the show) (To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.). 


When I first heard Mirri's prophecy I thought she was just being hella salty and cursing Dany to be sterile and heartbroken, and when I heard Quaithe's I was legitimately confused and figured she was just an eccentric Qartheen weirdo... at first. I never noticed the similarities between these two prophecies, or disregarded them, until now. I have seen [another theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/30mat2/spoilers_all_ddt_a_neverbeforeseen_theory/)  that claims Mirri is talking about time-travel, but paired with Quaithe's theory and the most recent event of S5 I think I have something a little less tin foily.
The basis of this theory is simplified by Quaithe ""To go forward you must go back."" Now, with our tinfoil hats affixed, let's look at a summary of Dany's life so far.

 * Dany is born in Dragonstone

 * Dany flees to the free cities

 * Dany is sold into a Dothraki horde and becomes its leader

 * Dany struggles for a bit (Qarth and the red waste and such)

 * Dany Dany takes some cities, thinks she's comfortable.

 * Dany has some more struggles (The Sons of the Harpy)

 * Dany ends up in a Dothraki horde again

Now let's say Quaithe is right, and that Dany is essentially going to have to go back if she wants the Iron Throne. If so, we might already have started to go in reverse. The future might look like this.

 * Dany eventually becomes the leader of the Dothraki horde (because dragons or Khal Drogo was a cool guy or something), Daario and J-Bear catch up but Varys, Missandei and Tryion are still in Meereen

 * Dany decides she doesn't care about Meereen anymore and leads the horde to the free cities, which would be logical if she wants to take Westeros

 * With boats, Dany leads the Dothraki to Dragonstone

But if we use these prophecies to apply to the entire targaryen family, we can go further.

 * Daenerys takes the Iron Throne with dragons and Dothraki, but not all the seven kingdoms

 * Dany has to fight a reversal of Robert's Rebellion to consolidate control of the seven kingdoms (this doesn't take too long, because dragons) 

But wait, theres more! If we apply this theory to the entire game of thrones universe we can see things even broader. More or less, the history of the game of thrones universe begins with the long night (though there was stuff before it like the first men's arrival and the children of the forest) so maybe it ends with the white walkers more or less annihilating the human race, or at least the andals. Only for the descendants of the first men to leave over the narrow sea and the children of the forest to live throughout Westeros again. 

Sorry if that was choppy, this is my first post, I haven't honestly thought about it that much, and this tinfoil is a little too tight. Lemme know what you think

TL;DR: D&amp;D will set up Dany to be Azor Ahai and then *shock* it's actually Jon!

As many of you have heard, a leaked audition script for season six features a red priestess named Kinvara who arrives at Meereen. In the scene, the priestess tells Tyrion that Dany ""has been sent to lead the people against the darkness ... for this war, and the Great War yet to come.""

The books have established the concept of Azor Ahai. The show has not (except for a few brief mentions by Mellisandre). This leaked scene demonstrates that the show wants to remind the viewers about Azor Ahai.  

But why?

The show will try to convince the viewers that Dany is Azor Ahai.  However, in the end, Jon will turn out to be Azor Ahai. At this point, this theory seems obvious to many fans. But Dan and Dave started planning s6 long before the ""Jon is resurrected theory"" became an internet phenomenon.

Of course, fans already had theorized about Jon's resurrection before s5. But before s5, these theories were mostly confined to ASOIF forums, and not part of broad, public attention (i.e. you would not find a major magazine talking about Jon snow). 

Remember, D&amp;D have to begin writing seasons well before production begins. Pre-production projects (such as location scouting) can't be done overnight. In other words, Dan and Dave are not going to say: ""Well, the fan forums guessed part of the plot, darn. Now we have to change the whole story. Call our location manager, tell him to cancel in Norway. And tell Kit he's fired.""

The player takes on the role of Ramsay Snow/Bolton, having per main quest ensuring he becomes the Warden of the North.

We get inner monologues on how Ramsay is completely effed up the way he is, as that's the only way (according to him) to not only survive, but thrive in Westeros.

There would be a table of Northern Houses which Ramsay would have to either destroy or convert to his father's side. If Ramsay is too nice in his decisions (e.g. sparing prisoners, accepting other lords' terms rather than enforcing his own) then he is progressively perceived as weak, leading to mutinies and assassination attempts. The tougher and meaner Ramsay is, the more likely are the lords to comply and do his bidding.

Combat works in the way that the more blood that is drawn (either yours or your enemies'), the faster and deadlier Ramsay becomes. Damage dealt is irreversibly proportional to the current armor score, encouraging the player to fight with a minimum of gear on. There would be special attacks to summon dogs, use them to pick up scents, pin enemies down, etc.

Besides Bolton troops, Ramsay would be able to make companions (called Reeks) which are npcs whose A.I. is careless enough to do whatever he commands them to. If Ramsay is not cruel enough, he starts losing control over his Reeks and they might turn on him.

Ramsay can go around villages and settlements and take on side quests to increase coin and reputation, quests like ""Bed the miller's daughter"", ""Collect 10 mysterious skins for the cloak maker"", ""Plant Bolton Flags on the North Lords' graves"", and so forth.

There would be Flaying Mini-Games where you'd use a tool kit to get info from prisoners by cutting/slicing over the etched lines on the convict's body, though the player must keep an eye on their health so the prisoners don't die before their time is due. 

Another mini game is actually played at the dinner table over a meal where Ramsay must select the correct quips and taunts to increase everyone's level of discomfort. One would have to know the universe's lore in order to know how to offend the characters better. 

As Ramsay gets experience and progresses through levels he can choose to upgrade his dog attacks, flaying abilities, persuasion, stats, etc. The player can even specialize in a certain playstyle, such as ""Shirtless"" or ""Bitch Master"".

Anyways, once the Houses are subjugated, the next part of the game unlocks, which is the huge battle vs Stannis' host. However, this is preceded by a special mission where Ramsay selects 20 good men to infiltrate the Baratheon camp via a stealth section and inflict as much chaos through combos (murder, arson, destruction) as possible.

After Stannis is defeated, there is a Littlefinger showdown in Winterfell. LF arrives with a bunch of Eerie knights and shenanigans, and at this point Ramsay has to make a major choice: side with LF, get rid of papa Bolton and become the Warden of the North, OR stand with his daddy agaisnt LF's assault, which would result in Roose being killed in the fight and Ramsay taking his place.

At this point of the game, Ramsay IS the Warden of the North, with LF leaving for King's Landing.

The prologue shows Ramsay having a meal with his deceased father's frightened former-wife, still pregnant. 

""There's a bright future ahead of us, mother!"" Ramsay smiles. ""A messenger from across the sea has brought us good tidings, though I admit I *did* have to prickle him a little bit first, just to be sure he was telling the truth.""

""... What news were those, my lord?"" The Frey woman asks, fearful.

Ramsay bursts into laughter, ""Oh, mother, I'm so looking forward to flaying a living dragon.""

*Camera zooms in on Ramsay's eyes, hinting at a sequel.*

Fin.

DLCs include dog and Reek reskins, as well as different Bolton cloaks to choose from.

Any feedback is welcome, as well as more ideas you'd like to add to this hypothetical game. Yeah, it's messed up, but you know you'd play it. Don't worry, that doesn't make you a monster. It makes you a Bolton.

In the end, I think this theme will lead them to their final fates in the story.

For example:

* Jon wants to be a Stark, to belong all the way until he faces the WW threat and his priorities change. Even then, I suspect a great portion of his musings are around 'belonging' and 'going home'. I am curious to know what knowledge of who his parents were will do to him. He is going to be happy he's still a Stark, for sure, but what about the other bit? I think Jon's sense of honour, of duty and of what is right/wrong is very strong and that he won't approve of his parents' actions that led to much tragedy, no matter what any prophecy said. The knowledge could make him bitter and unhappy (about things that can't be changed). He might even blame himself for what his parents did and sign up for some final sacrifice at the end. 

* Arya clings to her vendetta list because it is big portion of her identity as a Stark and what that means for her (family, Winterfell as home). She thinks a lot about going home to Jon (in the books, at least). I suspect that she'll eventually quit her assassin training and try to make her way her back to Westeros, to the Wall, where her last living family member is. She is unlikely to think that Sansa will have survived. The Westeros she returns to will be very different (Lannisters will have become powerless, maybe the Tyrells too and Dorne will be a player). This changed place may cause her to doubt if she belongs there anymore and lead her to some desperate act to find family/friends (Hello, Gendry, where are you?). 

* Dany hasn't known a proper home, but she remembers her lemon tree often and the house with the red door(?). Also, her whole desire to go back to Westeros is because of her belief that the people want her there, that she'll be finally home/finally belong. I suspect this desire also led to her embracing the ways of the Dothraki, so that they would accept her and love her. In the end, she will have to confront the bitter truth that Jorah once tried to teach her (about what the common people want) and realize that she has no place in Westeros. She will understand that she threw away a life she could have done lots more in (Mereen) for a life where she just added to the general tragedy of Westeros. Maybe she will become sad enough to go out with a big bang (against the WW, at which point her plot might finally join Jon's).

* Tyrion's whole life has been about wanting to be accepted by his family (father, in particular - his Daddy issues revolve around this), acknowledged for his talents (I suspect even after Blackwater he held out hope that people at court or his own father would commend him for the defence of KL). I won't go deep here, since I am sure most of us have seen evidence on the show or in the books about his need to belong (his defence at Joffrey's trial bears out this well). I think there is a good chance that he will come to like Dany (he has come to like all the women he knows, except for Cersei and that can't be blamed on him). Maybe Dany's death/destruction spiral (if she does go mad) will be the last lesson he has on belonging and he will finally give up on people (like Varys did) and just serve the realm. 

* Theon is torn between the family of his blood and that of his heart, throughout the series. At first, he doesn't realize this and he thinks picking one over the other will make him happy. It doesn't. His issues with women (back when he had the time to have issues with women) stem out of this. As an aside, I think GRRM's way of showing how inner issues leads to unhealthy relationships (I am thinking both Dany and Tyrion here) is very clever. His end will likely be at one of the places he wanted to call home (Pyke or Winterfell) or by the side of one of the people he wanted to call family (Yara or Sansa), defending. 

* LF - LittleFinger's childhood was perhaps a mirror of Theon's in the drive to belong. He may have thought that Cat, whom he set on a pedestal, was the key to finally belonging among the lords of Westeros - getting love, lands, power and name all in one go. When his dreams are crushed, he sets out to get all of that on his own. He manages to get lands, power and name, but he hasn't found love yet. This is why his obsession with Sansa will lead to his end. Maybe he gets into a situation where he can win in normal cases but he flies his Sansa-flair and bows out of the game? Maybe he does the opposite and wins, but has to bear Sansa's loss and live with the knowledge.

* Sansa likes predictability, love and security. She gets none of these and has to live with the knowledge that her fairytale notions had a big portion in the deaths of her family. The time she doesn't have to worry about the latest problem that can end her life, she spends thinking of family, home. She is going to try and find her brothers (Bran, Rickon) if she survives Ramsay, and then try to take their home back, or the other way around (Personally I think she doesn't yet have the guts to do something like that on her own - maybe having Theon's advice will help. It helped Robb back then). I think she will survive it all (as Tyrion says once in KL after a Joffrey-encounter) and live to see the bittersweet ending. It suits her, somehow, to be left behind and alone (she's unlikely to try the marriage business again), in possession of lands and safety, but without family or loved ones anymore.

[Alt Shift X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9IO1_Qkjc0) has a video explaining the theory, which boils down to, ""A freakishly big knight is dying, a necromancer uses him in creepy experiments, then produces a freakishly big knight who doesn't seem completely normal, or alive."" Hafr ""Thor"" Bjrnsson (the Mountain's third and most recent actor) even put [this image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204811683071973&amp;set=p.10204811683071973&amp;type=1&amp;theater) onto his Facebook page.

Anyway, it is clear that Robert Strong is some kind of half dead walking corpse, bound to do whatever Cersei/Qyburn tells him/it to do, and that his ""vow of silence"" is there just to cover for the fact that Robert won't, or more likely *can't* speak. Even his [helmet has been badly molded together to cover his mouth, or whatever is left of it](https://40.media.tumblr.com/733b9fdb724b951692eb6c805d4ab25a/tumblr_inline_npyz7dR61J1s813r5_540.png). So, what is my theory?

Qyburn removed the mouth to stop Robert from screaming in agony.

In the books, the Mountain drank milk of the poppy because of his constant blinding migraines, probably from his nearly impossible size and proportions (extremely tall people, such as the similarly shaped [Andre the Giant](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Andre_in_the_late_'80s.jpg), suffer from all kinds medical issues because of the strain their height puts on their bodies).  Anyway, after nearly dying from an extremely painful poison, Gregor is handed over to Qyburn.

Qyburn, the former Maester who has served the Boltons after being thrown out of the Citadel for [experiments relating to life and death.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueUGThCNNb4) When Gregor was put on Qyburn's operating table was not the first time they met. Qyburn was left for dead at Harrenhal by the Mountain and the Mountain's gang, so there is nothing to suggest that Qyburn particularly cares for the Mountain outside of the possibilities the Mountain presents as a test subject.

In the books, the Mountain is screaming in the dungeons, while in the show he is silently thrashing around in pain in Qyburn's lab. So, in life and in death, it clear that the Mountain is and shall always be experiencing horrific pain. Having a constantly screaming Knight, even if it is a completely loyal Frankenstein Knight, would not do. Simple solution? Remove the Mountain's entire lower jaw, and put him in a face concealing helmet to hide that fact.

TL:DR: The Robert Strong (I.E. the Mountain) ""holy vow of silence"" is because he is missing his jaw just to stop the Robert's constant cries of pain and agony.",50,47,False,self,,,,,

And if you guys remember from season 5 the main general whitewalker watched Jon Snow killed a white walker general and he seemed surprised and impressed of Jon Snow.

Khal Drogo summons his army to invade Westeros after an assassin tries to poison Daenerys. Ned asks Baelish to secure the cooperation of the City Watch in removing the Lannisters from the throne revealing that Joffrey is not Robert's son but Jaime's, making Robert's younger brother, Stannis, the true heir. Ned brings Robert's declaration before Cersei, Joffrey, and the Small Council. However, Baelish and the City Watch reveal themselves loyal to the Lannisters, capture Ned and kill his men.

While Arya is able to run during her father's punishment, Sansa is left to ask King Joffrey for mercy over her father. Jon and the Night's Watch confront an ancient evil from beyond the Wall, while across the Narrow Sea, Drogo's army marches west towards the Seven Kingdoms.

Perhaps she goes to the Wall to find herself some Jon Snow kings blood in a last desperate attempt to save Stannis, who she still believes is AA? Perhaps it actually is the Night King who resurrects Jon Snow? Setting up the whole ice (Jon and the walkers) versus fire (Dany and the dragons) scenario? Perhaps when an adult is resurrected as a walker they retain their sense of self and memories. So Jon remains Jon. I expect there will be plenty of big battles to come, but I agree with others that the ultimate end of the series will be a truce/understanding between ice and fire brokered by Jon. Just sad/bittersweet that Jon will have to sacrifice his humanity and end the series as a white walker North of the wall. Anyways, just a thought.

John is dead, and at least for me that's no fun. But I was thinking, during the day Melisandre showed up to the wall and we can assume is taking up temporary residents in castle black. Now, John is dead yes, but maybe not for long.

 As you may remember some time during 3 or 4 the hound fights a follower of the lord of light and kills him, but another says a prayer and brings him back from the dead and as he goes on to explain this is not the first time. 

 So let's get back to Melisandre and why she is in castle black, the day before she arrived they had sacrificed Shireen and said she had visions. Now clearly what she said to stand was a lie as he lost the battle and died, but we still don't know who didn't have other visions. She could've foreseen johns death and headed to castle black to try to pre envy it, or bring him back to life. Melisandre obviously has interests in John as we've seen before, and when she has the ability to bring someone back to life it seems appropriate to use it in a character of such magnitude.

 Now this may just be wishful thinking but John seems like he was a character with a bigger role to play and has still not fulfilled. But it's not uncommon for George R.R. To kill off characters like that, so I'm probably wrong but still, maybe? ",6,0,False,default,,,,,

-Brienne fights Ser Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane, Arya escapes and leaves Sandor to die, but doesn't actually kill him;       ***GET HYPE***

Why ""birds""? Of course people would suspect they were simply his spies, but I suspect it holds other connotations and is used as a derogatory term for women. They are prostitutes from all over the AGOT world. This means he gets all of his information from almost every whorehouse and prostitute. 

As we already know, whorehouses are almost everywhere. Many important conversations are held inside them and many important people visit them. The prostitutes would be able to gain information on many matters from this. Furthermore, a lot of news is spread in whorehouses through normal conversations. All of this is important to Varys for he needs as much information as possible within his role as a spymaster. 

We hear of how prostitutes may be able to gain information in the same way as the women of the Dothraki. Despite not being prostitutes, these women told Daenerys of many stories, all of which they heard from ""happy men"". This means that prostitutes would be able to use sex as a tool to extract information from almost anyone since, as prostitutes, they are unsuspecting and viewed as useless and worthless. 

How did he get information of Ned and Cat being in Littlefinger's brothel? Prostitutes

How did he keep tabs on little finger? Prostitutes

How does he get information on people of westeros and beyond? Prostitutes

How did information ""go dark"" when seeking information? The prostitutes didn't have access to the spied

You may ask ""howcome he felt so vulnerable going into the whorehouses with Tyrion?"" He acted it. The only reason he would and let Tyrion go in the first place is because he has information on almost everywhere around him. He knew what was going on and where they were safe. However, he did also feel unnerved in seeing what conditions his ""birds"" were in. Varys has always had morals and a want for a better world, but he knew what bad he had to go through in order to make that change. 

It is also a reason he employed Littlefingers prostitute helper (I forgot her name). Varys was adding her to his arsenal of prostitutes as he knew how to handle them. 

My final and most crucial piece of evidence is a scene with Varys and Tyrion. Tyrion remarks that he might throw Varys into the sea and Varys replies that Tyrion may not like the results. What is most important to Tyrion? Tits and wine. What are in whorehouses? Tits and wine. If Varys were to die then they would be a mess without their head pimp and Tyrion wouldn't be able to get the pussy he deserves.

My response is usually ""Does it matter?""  People want the bloodline succession to work - because it avoids wars - and only king wannabees want wars - everyone else .. does not. Bloodline succession is helpful in preventing wars when the king dies - if the king leaves an heir - everyone can avoid a messy, bloody conflict by agreeing to honor that.  But let's take a look at how well bloodline succession is serving Westeros:

Current King Tommen - is thought many to not be the rightful heir - due his being the child of incest which did not include the king, but rather the queen and her brother.  This is a rumor which has even passed the lips (apparently) of Bravosi bankers. 
Previous King Joffery - was no more the rightful heir on the same basis.  His death - even though it was apparently a smooth succession to his younger brother - set off a series of events that left Westeros without an effective leader (on the death of Tywin and exile of Tyrion) and also set up a partial takeover of the government by a legitimized group of religious fanatics. 
King Robert - was not the rightful heir - he was a usurper who won the throne in battle by defeating the son of the king in combat, and defeating the king's armies in war - and the king himself was killed (see below).  He was named king because he was the leader of the conquering armies.  Although he died with apparently two male sons and two brothers - his death sparked a war with five different armies vying for the crown. 
King Aerys II (the Mad) - was the rightful heir - he started out pretty well, but his developing rivalry with his Hand - Tywin Lannister and his madness caused several houses and ultimately Tywin to rise up and depose him.  He was killed by Jaime Lannister, his Hand's son and sworn kingsguard.  He had a surviving son Viserys - but in this case, bloodline succession did not take place. 
King Aegon V (""Egg"") was the fourth son of a fourth son.  He ruled wisely and well for 26 years.  He died trying to hatch dragon eggs with magic. His son assumed the throne. 

So of the previous four kings - only two were the rightful heirs - and only one succession took place without bloodletting and political turmoil. 

Bloodline succession in Westeros is in shambles and everyone is figuring that out. The king's kids aren't his  and the Barratheon line is otherwise ended. The rule of the last Targaryen was ended with good cause and the fate and legitimacy of claims of any heirs is unknown to most.  There is no tribunal Gendry or Daenerys can take their claims of genetics, parentage, etc.. to that can award them the crown.  The crown is now available to any who can take it.  This is the Game of Thrones in full play - your arguments of who is next? don't matter.   At this point - you win or you die. ",35,22,False,self,,,,,

* Arya is lost, but Nymeria will find her and somehow they will both get to either Robb or Jon.

* Sansa will marry Joffrey, but kill him in his sleep (posibly with the help of The Hound)

* The northmen are going to unite and basically wipe every bitchy Lannister (exact words) 

* Dany will raid Westeros with dragons, make friends with the northmen and together everybody will figh off the white walkers.

* Lysa Arryn is a cunt. (actual words)

I tried looking through some other Melisandre posts on this subreddit and a few google searches and have not found much or it has some of my ideas about her all articulated into one place. 

I have not read all the books yet as I am going to be starting book 3 shortly but I am also not afraid of spoilers, especially if they help explain this thought that I have been having about the lady Melisandre. I'm wondering if Melisandre just played the long con with Stannis. I just watched the part in the show where they burn Selyse's brother and it got me thinking about this.

Melisandre, the dragons, r'hllor and the Targaryens.  Melisandre has been tasked with destroying the Baratheon name ever since King Robert died. While Renly and Stannis have their own sort of conflict, Melisandre does nothing to dissuade Stannis from going after his brother and kills him with her blood magic. They burn Selyse's brother and countless others and I think its just all apart of the greater plan to destroy the Baratheon name. Melisandre knows her work is complete once she burns Shireen. Yes Shireen isn't dead in the book but she is in the show and I remember D&amp;D stating in an interview that she does die in the next book. 

Expanding on Shireen, there's been hints throughout the show that she should be sacrificed. Besides screwing Stannis' army because I do feel she knew if they burned Shireen, Stannis' army of sellswords would leave him high and dry. The look of despair on her face when she goes back to the wall isn't because Stannis lost, its because she had to burn a child. She knew it was her job to do so the whole time as it is apart of the greater plan to bring the Targaryens back into power while not only crushing the Baratheon name but also spitting on any sort of honor it once had. 

Quaithe is mysteriously protective of Daenarys but the show does not go too deep into it and in season 5 we are introduced to another red priestess (the one Tyrion sees) that talk about how Daenarys is the chosen one or something like that (I can't remember the exact phrasing). Melisandre is just doing her part in Westeros by crushing the Baratheons. 

She needs to revive Jon not only because he may be Azor Ahai reborn but to further the only Targaryen line left with Daenarys. This is the part I'm least sure about, its one of those things where we think Jon is coming back because ""Its so obvious"" and they are fooling us and I think the rest of the theory fits whether or not this part is true.

***

## Dorne ##

### &gt; 50% Confident ###

The way I see it, Doran was probably in on Myrcella's death, and there's no way in hell that ship she was on is actually sailing for King's Landing, unless Jamie and Bronn are able to fight off all the Dornishmen aboard. 

I think the plan is to send Trystane straight to Meereen, along with the gift of a captive Jaime Lannister (keep in mind that he betrayed and killed Dany's father, so it's her chance to take revenge) and the offer of an alliance (if not a marriage proposal). In this, Trystane would essentially be filling Quentyn's role from the books (which *could* mean it doesn't end well for him). 

Oh, and I don't think Tyrion will allow Danerys to kill Jaime, but I do suspect that the two Lannister brothers will have a major falling out, and I get the sense that somehow, Jaime will end up fighting against Dany's forces in the ultimate battle for King's Landing. Just a gut feeling on that part. 

### &lt; 50% Confident ###

Of course, there's a somewhat plausible (even if slightly tin-foily) theory that Trystane is actually a Targaryen himself, the thought-to-be-dead son of Rhaegar and Elia Martell (that is, Aegon Targaryen in hiding) who was secretly raised by Doran as his own son. 

This could certainly be an exciting revelation, and it would give the showrunners the opportunity to adapt the Young Griff storyline in a much more simplified manner (removing the need for a Jon Connington character, getting Tyrion to Meereen sooner, etc.). I'm not completely convinced this theory is true, of course, but I at least think it makes better sense than the Tyrion-is-the-Mad-King's-son theory-- especially in terms of its usefulness in advancing the over-arching plot of the series. 

Nevertheless, were this theory (R + E = T = A) true, it's quite possible that the TV writers might merge the Aegon/Young Griff storyline and the Quentyn storyline into one (and keep in mind that we book readers can't be very sure that Aegon is actually who he claims to be, which could also come into play on the show). 

***

## The North / The Wall / North of The Wall ##

### &gt; 50% Confident ###

Bran, who is training to be a greenseer, will have visions of his father's past-- possibly where Ned is a child, and perhaps even the much-desired Tower of Joy scene, when Ned (thanks to the help of Howland Reed) defeated Ser Arthur Dayne and rushed in to rescue his sister, Lyanna, only to find her dying (and insisting that he make her a mysterious promise, which forms much of the basis of the R + L = J theory). One way or another, I think Bran will realize the truth of Jon's parentage (that he's half-Stark, half-Targaryen).

### &lt; 50% Confident ###

It's been speculated that Jon's Targaryen identity might be confirmed when the Night's Watch tries to burn his corpse (i.e. it wouldn't burn), but Targaryens aren't fireproof, as is often thought (Dany's funeral pyre survival was a miracle brought about by blood magic). If Jon's body doesn't burn, it would have to be the Lord of Light miraculously preventing it (or something to that effect). 

How, then, might the other characters (besides Bran) learn of Jon's true identity? Good question. Melissandre, who might already know who Jon is, could possibly convince a few people, but I can't imagine many men of the Night's Watch being compelled by whatever fire visions she might conjure. 

I think Bran will communicate with Theon and/or Sansa, who have escaped to the ~~Godswood~~ Wolfswood outside Winterfell, using the Weirwood trees... and I suspect that this might be how Sansa and Theon learn the truth (Brienne and Podrick may be there as well). From there, it's uncertain if the they will head North to the Wall (unaware of Jon's tragic fate), or if Theon/Reek will be reunited with the Ironborn/Greyjoys (or both). 

By the end of the season finale, it's quite possible that the Wall comes down and that the Others begin wreaking havoc on the North. Hopefully the Boltons at Winterfell get what's coming to them; Brienne, on the other hand, will probably just barely escape, thanks to the help of her Valyrian steel sword (which we strongly suspect can kill White Walkers). 

***

## The Iron Islands ##

### &gt; 50% Confident ###

~~It does seem that the Ironborn will return in Season 6, and I can only imagine them sending their fleet to Meereen like they do in the book. They're ready to ally themselves with Danerys, or so it would seem.~~
The Ironborn may return, but more likely in an attack on Oldtown, where Sam Tarly will also be.

### &lt; 50% Confident ###

~~If I can be crazy speculative, perhaps Theon will bring the Greyjoys word of Jon snow's true parentage (or, to make an even crazier speculation, perhaps Jon himself, after he's been resurrected by Melissandre) just before the Ironborn set sail for Meereen. This could be how Danerys first learns of Jon, or perhaps even crosses paths with him (although I think the latter is much less likely).~~

~~By the end of the season, the Ironborn ships may be poised to help carry Danerys' forces across the Narrow Sea.~~

EDIT:
Nevermind. As /u/Ibbenese noted, Danerys already has the ships she needs from the Meereenese Navy. Perhaps the Ironborn come into conflict with the Tyrell army, though, creating more-- or perhaps *removing*-- problems for the crown. 

***

## Meereen ##

### &gt; 50% Confident ###
~~A major battle is coming, and I think it begins well before the end of the season. Yunkai and its allies in Slaver's Bay are going to try to retake Meereen, and Danerys probably will not be there at the start of the fight (since she's off in the Dothraki sea, facing off with Khal Jhaqo). Either way, Danerys wins a decisive victory in the end, probably aided by the Ironborn, whose fleet will arrive just in time (and quite possibly some Dothraki horsemen who have come to her side).~~ 

EDIT:
/u/Ibbenese correctly pointed out that in the show, Danerys already has ships, and so the Ironborn aren't needed (plot-wise) in Meereen... and that since Ser Barristan Selmy is no longer alive on the show, there may not even be a big battle with Yunkai and the other Slaver's Bay cities. I'm inclined to agree. There may be no Second Siege of Meereen on the show, although the unrest within the city is bound to continue in Dany's absence. This could be part of the reason to get Tyrion to Meereen earlier on the show... so that he can help rule during this chaotic time (instead of Ser Barristan leading her forces in battle). I'm thinking I was wrong on this one, though I'm sticking with the Dornish/Trystane plot and Danery's departure for Westeros by the end of the season. 

### &lt; 50% Confident ###

I'm not so sure that Dany can trust the Ironborn, nor the Dornish for that matter. Both groups seem most interested in their own power and, by extension, Dany's dragons. I expect some burned-alive would-be-dragon-thief action to take place. 

Nevertheless, in the finale, Danerys will finally set sail for Westeros, ~~likely accompanied by the Ironborn fleet.~~ Then again, she may opt to fly (what sort of range do dragons have, anyway?)... I'm not sure fire-breathing dragons and wooden ships are the best combination. If that's the case, she'd be riding Drogon... and the other two dragon riders seem like anybody's guess (Jon? Tyrion? Trystane? Jorah?).

## King's Landing ##

### Fucking Confirmed ###
Cleganebowl.

Actually, I would be quite satisfied if the Hound *was* found to be alive, but that he had found some sort of peace and had no desire to return to fight his undead brother in Cersei's trial by combat. Then again, who wouldn't like to see an epic battle between the two brothers, and to see the ""Valonqar"" prophecy fulfilled in this way?

### &gt; 50% Confident ###
Cersei's power is all but gone, and Kevan is the new regent until King Tommen comes of age. This, however, will never happen, as Tommen will probably die this season (definitely before Cersei, and, if I'm being crazy speculative here, perhaps even at Cersei's own hands-- an incredible twist of irony given Cersei's love for her children, what Tyrion once called her ""one redeeming quality""). 

### &lt; 50% Confident ###

Cersei dies by season's end, and the Lannister plot is all-but-ended. But before that happens, Tommen must die, and I'd expect Cersei to get some sort of revenge on the Sparrows/Martells/Tyrells before kicking the proverbial bucket.

## Braavos ##

### &gt; 50% Confident ###

Arya's blindness isn't permanent. That's all I know about her. How her story wraps up is a complete mystery to me. 

Mace Tyrell is heading back from his visit to the Iron Bank, and he won't be pleased about what has happened to Margarey and Loras. In King's Landing, he'll confront Kevan Lannister, who has been named regent, and threaten to march his armies on King's Landing if certain concessions are not made. As a result, he'll eventually be made Hand of the King, and his forces will end up defending King's Landing when Danerys arrives from Essos. 

### &lt; 50% Confident ###

Ok, I'm really just completely guessing here, but it would be nice to see Arya make a little more progress on that list of hers... Maybe she heads back to Westeros and conveniently runs into Walder Frey? Or will her blindness make her commit completely to joining the Faceless Men, and she'll just quietly disappear, never to be heard from again?

# Beyond Season 6 #

It's much harder for me to say what happens beyond season 6, but here are a few big-picture guesses...

* **Jon Snow** is probably alive again. While it's possible that he'll be fighting for the White Walkers, I don't think that's likely. Instead, I think he will be brought back by Melissandre, and I think he will end up being the true savior of the story by brokering/forcing a truce with the Others. Because of this, I wouldn't be surprised if the people wish to make him their new king, even if Jon is reluctant to assume the throne. 

* Jon's brother **Bran,** who has essentially become a god at this point, is likely to play a crucial role in guiding Jon from a distance. 

* **Danerys,** on the other hand, is more likely to become a sort of accidental villain; she is completely unaware of the coming War for the Dawn and is most interested in taking her place as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. She will fail to take the threat from the Others seriously; I could even see the Others arriving at King's Landing just after she begins her assault, sweeping in to crush the armies on both sides of the conflict. 

* **Tyrion** may very well face his brother Jaime in the assault on King's Landing, and perhaps witness his death. This will bring Tyrion very mixed emotions, as he both loved and hated his brother at the same time.

* One thing I'm absolutely convinced of: **Jorah Mormont** will betray Danerys to save the Seven Kingdoms from the Others; I feel like the entire narrative has been building to this gut-wrenching (yet unavoidable) plot twist. There is even a theory that Jorah is Azor Ahai, but I won't get into the details of that here. 

* In an alternate scenario where Jon Snow really stays dead (that is, no resurrection), it's even possible that Jorah receives Jon's Valyrian steel sword, Longclaw (being that it once belonged to Jorah's father), and that through Jorah's betrayal of Danerys, it becomes the mythical sword, Lightbringer (Azor Ahai pierces his beloved wife's heart to temper his sword). 

The story ends with most of Westeros in ruins, and with many of our most beloved characters dead. That said, there's hope: the Others have ceased their assault; the Lannisters are finally gone; the great houses are too tired for any more war. Maybe Rickon finally shows up in the last episode and becomes Lord of Winterfell. I don't know. It's *Game of Thrones.* What happens is really anybody's guess.

But I often see in discussions over at /r/asoiaf about the show that they think those 600 minutes are not enough to tell the story well and that everything feels rushed that way, *however*, that there's simply not enough time in the year to make more or longer episodes because they already work on it year round. I'm currently binge-watching Gossip Girl though and while one episode there is only about 40 minutes long, they make at least 20 episodes per season, which makes 800 minutes.

On Gossip Girl, it's always the same handful of people every episode. They can't film very much simultaneously, because there are always some actors that are needed for different scenes at the same time. On Game of Thrones, every plot is contained in one specific area. They can film in King's Landing while they film at the Wall and in Winterfell at the same time, which saves a lot of time. So, I'm just wondering why they need so much more time. Is it the elaborate set that needs a lot of time to be built before they can start filming? Editing? I don't know much about film, so I have no idea, but I'm curious.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

Death is the only way a sworn brother can escape his vows. Red lady brings Jon back. Stannis is alive. Brienne needs him to save Sansa. Stannis needs an army. Naturalizes Jon. Jon Stark is now rightful heir to Winterfell. Gets the wildlings to fight for him and by proxy Stannis

I think Jon Snow died when he was stabbed by the Nights Watch. There is no getting around it hes dead. But this is crucial for advancing the rest of Jons story. A sworn brother of the Nights Watch is sworn to serve until he dies. Now that Jon is dead his oath has been fulfilled he owes no obligation to them, and if he comes back from the dead he couldn't realistically serve there without being killed again. 
The red witch is at the wall, and we know that the red god has the power to bring people back from the dead so its not unlikely that she will revive Jon. She showed a lot of interest in Jon before leaving with Stannis. She knows something we don't about Jon and she wont let him stay dead for long. 
Once Jon is back he wont be able to stay at the wall he will need a place to run. This is where Stannis comes in. In the show we never see if Brienne killed him. I think that she knows she needs him to be able to save Sansa. Even though she swore an oath to kill Stannis she swore another to save the Stark girls. I think she will use Stannis to complete her quest to save Sansa telling herself she will kill Stannis when the job is done. If Stannis is still alive Melisandre will take Jon to him. Stannis told Jon at the wall he needs him as warden and that he would make Jon Snow, Jon Stark. Jon turned him down because he had an oath to the Nights Watch. Now that he no longer owes a debt to the Watch he is free to join Stannis and help him try and retake Winterfell. 
Stannis's army was decimated by the Boltons and there is little chance he will be able to raise an army agian. But that's where Jon comes into play. Jon just saved a very large army from North of the wall. Hes beginning to look like Mance Raider 2.0. The Wildlings would never fight for just Stannis, but for Jon they might.

If they wanted to kill Cersei off, there are much better ways than spending a season building up her downfall and revealing her undead champion JUST to kill him off straight after so the Hound can come back in a blaze of glory (also, how would a wounded, limping Hound defeat this massive undead hulk?) I also think it makes no sense for the Hound to end up in this situation: if he is alive as the Gravedigger, he has found some sort of peace. He would need to somehow find out Robert Strong is The Mountain, and even then, he'd have to give up his life of peace to basically commit suicide (even an uninjured Hound would struggle to take the Mountain, but with Sandor having such injuries a victory is all the more unlikely). I also don't believe the Faith would go out of their way to track Sandor down and have him fight for them.

So let's say Cleganebowl happens, and Robert wins. The Hound actually survived, found peace, then discovered his brother was ""alive"", traveled to KL, convinced the Faith he should fight for them, only to get cut down during that trial. This serves absolutely no person and ruins the Hound's arc entirely: bringing him back from supposed death for what reason? To have his brother brutally kill him in a trial by combat. People may argue that is GRRM's style, to show how terrible the world can be and blah blah blah, but it would literally be bringing a character back from his kind of happy ending just to have him killed for almost no reason, and I don't think that would be good writing.

However... I could believe D&amp;D including Cleganebowl as something to please the fans, in which case, I would probably enjoy it, but wouldn't expect it from the books.",34,9,False,self,,,,,

And after that, I expect we'll see the army of the dead come knocking on the Bolton's door at Winterfell - a nice little commentary on the uselessness of having finally made it to being top of the heap when the end of days comes around.

Sansa and Shae are desperately trying to hide the blood stain, when Sandor suddenly appears on the scene, and the next thing you know, the Queen knows all about it. So, are we to infer that Sandor told her? I just think this is strange and sort of out of keeping with his character at this point. Sure, he's loyal to the Lannisters, and probably wouldn't blatantly defy them unless he had a really good reason (as in the Battle of the Blackwater), but it seems like it would be quite easy for him to just pretend he didn't see anything. I doubt he would get in trouble for that, and we know he feels some kind of desire to protect Sansa. Why would he do it? Am I just reading too much into Sandor's feelings for Sansa? I'm not trying to suggest anything romantic, just pointing out that his previous actions seem to suggest that he cares about her.

While I agree that honor is incredibly important to Ned, there is something that is more important to him than honor. Something that makes him do things that people simply don't expect from him. Something that makes him sacrifice his honor and claim himself a traitor just before his death.

It's family. Family is by far the most important thing in Ned's eyes. The largest example of this is his execution. Ned was never meant to be executed, he was supposed to live out the rest of his days at the Night's Watch. This would have confirmed to the world that Ned had been a traitor and was in the wrong about his discoveries. Remember, why was Ned willing to destroy his honor like this? It was for his children. He knew Sansa begged for mercy, and it destroyed him inside. He knew his family were scattered and struggling. So Ned decided to sacrifice his honor to bring his family back to some form of normality.

Obviously it didn't work, but the thought was there. Hell, the reason Ned was captured in the first place was down to the importance he places on family. His warning to Cersei, while backfiring considerably, came from Ned's thoughts of his own family. As bad as Cersei had been to him, and was going to be, he knew that at the end of the day she was still a mother, and he couldn't live with himself if he let Robert kill her and leave their children motherless.
In fact, this clash between family and honor is a massive part of Ned's character. If R+L=J is to be believed, then we know that ultimately Ned was forced to decide between honor and family at the Tower of Joy. Lyanna saying 'promise me Ned' was enough to make him go against his honor. He took Jon as his own, and told the world it was his own bastard. In the end, for Ned, family was always more important to him than honor. And while people seem to think this was Ned's downfall, I disagree.

In fact, Ned's dedication to family could potentially be what saves all of Westeros. If Jon is the Prince that was Promised, and he is indeed the one to unite the Seven Kingdoms and bring the fight to the White Walkers, then Ned's life work will have paid off. Ned's promise to Lyanna, his decision to abandon his honor, ultimately would have resulted in the world's salvation. While Ned Stark died a long time ago, in the end, it is his will and dedication to family that ultimately will allow Westeros to survive the coming Winter. The same thing that killed Ned will in the end be the very thing that mattered most.",29,53,False,self,,,,,

I was recently rewatching this episode and something hit me that I'd never considered before. This might be really obvious and this might end up being a stupid question, but why does Robert use ""Kingslayer"" as an insult against Jaime? Obviously, I understand why people in general call him ""Kingslayer,"" it's because he slew ""the Mad King"" Aerys II during Robert's Rebellion. However, it seems to me that Robert should be the last person to use this against Jaime because...well, it was HIS rebellion. What did Robert intend to happen to the Mad King?

The guy rebelled against him and personally killed his heir, Prince Rhaegar. Is being the slayer of a prince so beloved as Rhaegar really that much better than being a slayer of an old lunatic clinging to power? And anyway, surely Robert intended to have Aerys killed by the end of the rebellion, right? So then isn't Jaime just getting it done quickly without Robert having to get his own hands dirty? Maybe he wanted the glory for himself or to add legitimacy to his claim by killing the king he rebelled against?

Robert rubs it in further when he asks about Jaime's first kill, ""not counting old men."" Old man or not, I still don't see why Robert seems so disapproving here. I don't see why he's using Aerys' age at the time of the murder against Jaime. Robert ordered the (failed) assassination of Daenerys, and she was just a child, which to me is just as bad and probably worse than killing an old man, especially given the fact that the old man was out of his mind whose continued existence was putting the entire city of King's Landing in danger. And yes, I understand that they're drunk (at least Robert is) and therefore probably not at their most reliable, but I feel like it still gives an indication of how Robert feels about Jaime. Is it just because he's a Lannister and the brother of a woman he has grown to dislike? He does insult the Lannisters and their ""smug, satisfied faces"" after all. What do you guys think? Again, sorry if I'm missing something or if it's a stupid question, just a thought I had while rewatching.",4,1,False,default,,,,,

I've read through a few of the previous discussions but couldn't find any concrete proof against my deeply-cherished belief - namely that Big Bob Baratheon fathered Jon on Lyanna Stark.
Why do I believe this? - It still makes sense that Ned would hide Jon's existence from Rob - Lyanna might have been begging Ned to raise Jon since we know she didn't think Rob was a particularly inspiring king. Perhaps Ned feared that Rob, in his Targaryen/baby-killing frenzy, would believe Jon was a Targaryen and kill him anyway. Maybe Ned just have wanted to keep Jon hidden and safe from the intrigues of the world, or perhaps he knew that Cersei would have Jon killed as a threat to her own babies (source: real life lions) - The timing could work. Robert's Rebellion lasted less than a year, according to the books, and Ned found Lyanna before the war even ended (before the fall of Dragonstone and other 'mopping-up' actions) so it's possible Rob impregnated Lyanna just before the war started. That might even be the catalyst which made Rhaegar 'kidnap' her. - Jon is strong. Super strong. He regularly proves his strength in melee and everyday tasks, and has already taken wounds that would have killed a lesser man. He's also recklessly brave and gives in to his passions, just like his papa - Unlike Big Bob, however, Jon is loyal, dutiful, capable of acting coolly and calmly, and plagued with a conscience - all Stark traits, whether from Lyanna or drilled into him by Uncle Ned - If Jon is part Baratheon, part Stark, that makes him the Ice and Dany the Fire, whereas if Jon was both the Ice and Fire (Stark and Targaryen) then that might mean Dany's entire plotline is a big red herring. What remains to be seen is whether it is Dany or Jon who is the 'good guy', or whether they both are, or even if the White Walkers are the real bad guys. If the Night's King tale is true, and the words 'Winter Is Coming' are a threat not a warning, then perhaps we might be in for one wild ride.
But anyway, that's my theory. I fondly believe there's still a glorious little mini-Bob running around up in the north, ready to avenge his dad and his uncle and possibly become a magical god of ice, destined to bring peace to Westeros and shove out the filthy Targaryen invaders. But I could be wrong. Can anyone provide any definitive proof, or any major hints that this is wrong? (Not looking for R+L=J proof, just disproof of the Rob+L=J theory)",0,1,False,default,,,,,

To clarify, I have not read the books, but I have skimmed the wiki entries of all the major book character extensively, so I'm not too concerned about spoilers.

The reason I raise this issue, is that I want to ask the book readers who would know more than me if the content of the show has negated anything in the book series thus far. For example, I've heard all about the Aegon Targaryen storyline, which sounds like it is a major plot point, whatever you happen to believe about his true lineage.

That said, the time has surely been and gone for the 'rightful King' that the book has presented, Aegon intercepting Tyrion prior to his audience with Daenerys in the books, and no mention yet of JonCon or Aegon well after Tyrion has met with Dany. Does this not suggest that Aegon will likely never become King in the books? I've heard it said that the books and show will differ along the way of the series but end up at roughly the same conclusion, and if this is the case, either the show is going to hurriedly and messily jam Aegon into the series, or ignore him altogether. 

As the latter seems more likely having missed the best time to introduce him, has the show made it clear that Aegon isn't actually all that relevant to the overall story of ASOIAF? Whatever the answer to this, are there other instances like this, like the lack of a Sarella Sand, or Stannis' (supposedly confirmed) death?",7,2,False,self,,,,,

But I have been struggling with the whole ""Melisandre resurrects Jon Snow"" thing. I think it's unlikely for several reasons:

1. She's never resurrected anyone before

2. She's not in the immeadiate vicinity when he dies, and ideally it needs to happen fast, or big time damage done

3. If she wanted him alive, and at least in the books seemed to know about his death, why didn't she stop it?

4. There's no clear evidence that she believes Jon Snow is Azor Ahai, so why would she bother? When she returns to the Wall she almost ignores him.

5. If she resurrects him the assasins are right there and would just kill him again.

6. Why would the character we most associate with ice be resurrected by fire? Does that even make sense?

7. Even if she does resurrect him she has no next move. Stannis had an army and power and allies she could exploit...Jon Snow has nothing...less than nothing. When Sam left, his last great supporter on the Wall left. He has no family, no army, no power. He's a traitor, assassinated by his NW brothers for treason, and hangs around with a red priestess who just happened to burn Shireen and destroy Stannis in a very, very failed attempt to win back Winterfell. And he just happened to let the Wildlings through the Wall. Not exactly qualities to endear him to those south of the Wall. As he says to Sam, he's the most hated man at the Wall. He tried to rally support from the Northern Houses while he was Commander and failed. So much for the ability of a Stark bastard to rally the North. And now that Sansa has escaped from Winterfell she seems to be the most likely Stark for the North to unite around. If anything, I think GRRM has been deliberately trying to construct a scenario where Jon CAN'T go south.

Don't get me wrong, I 100% believe Jon Snow is coming back. Just not through Melisandre or Fire Magic. My bet is on either the Nights King or the Old Gods/Bran. I see him heading North, not south. ",34,3,False,self,,,,,

So I figure I should be a bit more specific. The little we've seen of Essos it seems due to their age they are far more advanced than the Seven Kingdoms.  As far as technological wonders go Essos seems to dominate, the have many wonders and seem to have far more worldwide cultural influence.

Lys known for their whores, Braavos has the Iron Bank and Titan of Braavos. Eastern religion seems more widespread than the Seven. Their roads being more ancient seem easier to travel. The roads in the Western Kingdoms seem incredibly run down and overrun with wilderness.

So first off, where going to assume that Jon is resurrected and la di da, he finds out R+l=J one of many ways that's not important to the theory(I'm personally hoping Howland Reed is involved). This inspires him to go over to Essos, and unite with his long lost sister. When he gets there Tyrion some how finds out that he's actually a Targarian, another fairly popular theory. A posible way he could find out is if Jon can manage to bring Bran and he Greensees it. They then come to the conclusion that they are going to go back to Westeros to fight the Wight Walkers, three Targayens flying over on their Dragons, and it isn't hard to get every Major house in Westeros to join you when you have dragons as reinforcement. Then they win somehow and the Targaryen countinue to rule over all the people, once again conquering and uniting the Seven Kingdoms with three dragons, This time its a brother and sister and their cousin, not a a guy and his two sister. Maybe they can even stop at Dragon stone on the way, just like the original Targayens did. Maybe John can marry Danny to tie together the whole Targayens continuing a line of incest. Maby Danny could go mad and start killing people with her dragons, burning them alive like her father did. I'm just throwing out ideas now, I really doubt any of this will come true, but it was fun thinking about it.

While there are games specifically meant for playing in Westeros (Green Ronin's *Game of Thrones* RPG is a perfect example), I decided to take a harder road. While not complete yet, my current list boasts Bronn, Tyrion, the Clegane brothers, Brienne, and several others. The project is about half done at present, and I'm limiting it to 20 characters.

They are strange, beautiful think, oh the Sidhe made of ice, something like that a different sort of life inhuman, elegant, dangerous.-G.R.R.M


George R.R. Martin clarifies the description of the Others with a comparison to the Sidhe, which are essentially faerie lords in Scottish mythologies. However, it is important to note that fae folk in many mythologies (Scandanavian, Celtic) tend to resemble Elves more than the two-inch tall pixies that that we associate them with in modern culture. Faerie folk in Scottish mythology belong to one of two faerie courts:
 
* Seelie, which are good faeries and tend to represent the sun. They can also be called Light faeries and tend to be playful and mischievous, but foster great love for humans. 
* Unseelie which represent the moon and tend to be malicious or evil. In Unseelie mythology, they cannot bear children and tend to steal humans during the night and turn them into Unseelie creatures. Some species of Unseelie are the dead themselves, brought back to life to haunt the living. 

George R.R. Martins comparison opens the channels to further relate the Others to the Sidhe, and I believe it is fairly safe to assume that they are Unseelie. The Others are similarly known to use other creatures to create more of their own, as demonstrated in the show by a very vivid scene depicting the transformation of Crasters son. Faeries are known to take offerings in return for boons or protection, so it makes sense that Craster would utilize the Others for a similar purpose.

To demonstrate the Free Folks fear of the Others and the Long Winter, Tormund mentions the following passage in an exchange with Jon Snow: Theyre never far, you know. They wont come out by day, not when that old suns shining, but dont think that means they went away. Shadows never go away. Might be you dont see them, but theyre always clinging to your heels.

 This also establishes one very important point: the Others dont come out during the day. Tormund also draws the connection between the Others and shadow, which in the religion of Rhllor is often described as another aspect of light. As winter comes throughout the Seven Kingdoms, they are able to move further south towards the wall under the shade of the snowfall and darkening days. And according to Old Nan, the Land of Always Winter may be where the Ice Dragon lurks.

**tl;dr:** the Others are Westeros faeries.

This is a modified excerpt from a much larger theory that I posted in r/asoiaf. [Here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3f67tn/spoilers_all_rhllor_the_meteor_and_the_magic_of/) if anyone's interested.",9,6,False,self,,,,,

1. Howland Reed: he was there and was a friend of Ned's. We haven't seen him yet and as far as I know the 2 have never met.

2. Bran could show him with a cool flashback vision. Which seems likely given the casting and shooting location news.

That's about it as far as I can see. I can't see Jon simply taking Melisandres word for it without some hard proof/evidence to back it up.

The other question is who would be able to convince the rest of Westeros? That's even trickier. Unless he emerges from his funeral pyre with white blond hair and violet eyes.

In season 2 Stannis is able to murder Renly, an heir to the throne (not the first in line but still) just by shagging melisandre. So just shagging a follower means that you can effectively murder anybody, anywhere, from the safety of your own home. And using the blood from Gendry, who is ""just"" his bastard niece, he is able to produce some very useful visions (if i remember correctly)


But in season 5 Stannis burns his own, young, daughter alive (whos' blood has got to be more powerful than fucking Gendrys') at the stake and all the lord of does is make the weather slightly better, he didn't get any help at the ""siege"" of winterfell, and ramsay was able to fuck more than half his army up with 20 ""good men"" before that anyways so all his previous offerings obviously didn't help. Why didn't melisandre just send a shadow to kill ramsay or roose? Or why didn't such a massive offering cause all boltons in winterfell to freeze to death or their food to rot and their horses dying in plague?

Is there any explainantion for what happened? Like that shadows only work on your own bloodline. I mean the Lord of light brings people back from death repeatedly like it's nothing and he doesn't ask much at fucking all for that. ",13,3,False,self,,,,,

Jon Snow nor Dany are Azor Ahai reborn.

Rhaegar Targaryen was, he was born under a bleeding star, amidst salt and smoke, with the blood of the dragon. Another thing is When you read about Rhaegar it says he was born during the Tragedy at Summerhall where fire was used to wake the dragons.

Lyana is Nissa Nissa (Azor Ahai's wife who was killed when Lightbringer was made), which means that Jon is Lightbringer.
Also Rhaegar never claims he isn't the prince. He simply says ""I will require a sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior,"" and people let it go. But that's not a no.

Points against it being Jon and Dany is that it requires a prince. Dany is a Queen, which is a step up, and while Jon is neither, he is closest to King of the North. Alas poor Rheager lived and died a Prince.

Lastly is the Song of Fire and Ice, that comes with the PrinceGRRM himself said ""I mean... Fire is love, fire is passion, fire is sexual ardor and all of these things. Ice is betrayal, ice is revenge..."" Who fits this more than Rheagar? He and LS fell in love, and their union ended with a child. However R was married at the time, and L was promised to Rob, a betrayal of their houses.

I know most of us assume R+L=J, however I think there is some plausibility to the idea that Rhaegar did in fact kidnap Lyanna and rape her like Robert believed, and in the end was left dying. I mean, he was the mad king's son, the apple doesn't fall far, especially with a Targaryen. I forgot where I read it, but the way Jon looks, he resembles a Stark, and could very well be Ned's bastard, albeit with Ashara Dayne and not Wylia. I don't believe GRRM designed the series to be about the prophetic hero, I think Jon being a Targ and AA would just be too Hollywood for GoT.

My problem starts in his POV chapter after this fight, where he describes the state of his hand after throwing a burning drape at the wight:

&amp;nbsp;
  

&gt;Mormont frowned. ""You do not look well. How is your hand?""
""Healing."" Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. **He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes**...his cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches.

Later he describes how the ""pain had been hideous"", feeling like his ""hand was still aflame, burning day and night"", only relieved when ""plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice"". My problem is, if the theory of R + L = J is presumed true, Jon shouldn't be harmed by the fire since he has dragon blood (being a Targaryen), proven true by Dany in a number of circumstances, but most evidently, where she literally sits in a flaming pyre for a freaking long time at Drogo's funeral at the end of AGOT and while other mere mortals are burned to a cinder.

&amp;nbsp;
  

&gt;When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Jorah found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackend logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped away . . . **yet she was unhurt**.

&amp;nbsp;


My query is, if Jon was so hurt by the flames of a drape where Dany was unhurt in a flaming frenzy, is that some serious cause for concern? I suppose when Viserys was killed by 'fire' (sort of) and Dany says ""He was no dragon, fire cannot kill a dragon"", that somewhat disputes the fact that all Targaryens are exempt from fire damage... But if Jon is a true 'dragon' and Viserys not, isn't that enough?

&amp;nbsp;
  

Thoughts? I'm slightly freaking out if this affects his glorious return...",18,0,False,self,,,,,

He believed that, if he burned King's Landing down with wild fire, he wouldn't just resurrect the long dead dragons, but *become* a Dragon himself. Jamie Lannister managed to put a stop to the King's madness before Aerys could unleash Wildfire onto the capital.

So, Aerys, his hand of the King Wisdom Rossart, and the rest of the high ranking members of the Alchemist Guild died in the sack, Robert became King, and we know the rest. However, in all this mayhem, one crucial thing didn't happen. No one ever found the Wildfire.

[As heavily implied in this lore video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeyvzeSA6PE) there is some huge amount of wildfire *somewhere* in King's Landing. We all know what happens [if you have enough wildfire in one place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un6ocmns-B4), and Tyrion feared even dropping a single canister would be enough to burn down King's Landing.

So, somewhere in the secret passages under the capital, we have what amounts to a giant bomb, with a fire that will keep burning no matter how much water is poured upon it, only going out when it runs out of fuel to burn. And I think someone is going to set it off, creating the [half destroyed throne room Dany saw in the House of the Undying](http://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/daenarys.jpg?fit=600%2C%209999&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C358px), just as winter finally arrives.

The most obvious situation for this to happen is if the White Walkers get as far south as King's Landing, and someone sets it off as a desperation move, to burn their Wight Minions and stop the advance of the dead. A poetic end, letting King's Landing, the center of a thousand pointless fights and a thousand pointless wars, burn down in attempt to win the *real* war, the War for the Dawn.

However, I think the Wildfire will be set off, in a final act of hatred and defiance, by Cersei. The season have not been kind to Cersei. She was seperated from the man she loves for months, watched her daughter be shipped off to Dorne, watch that same brother kill her son (from her perspective, at any rate), watch her last son effectively being taken away from her by the Whore of Highgarden, get betrayed by the High Sparrow, and put through a horrific walk of shame. ^^^^^Ding ^^^^^Ding. 

As a boat comes with even more bad news, Tommen is the only thing she can live for. She said it herself, her children are the one thing preventing her from throwing herself out a tower, and she is fated to outlive them.

Now, Cersei, this hateful, miserable woman, who has seen everything she has worked for, everything she ever loved, ripped from her one piece at a time, now sees nothing but red. The city betrayed her, they betrayed both her sons. It is filled with nothing but backstabbers and whores. All the deserve now is the Stranger's kiss. They must burn.

This would be the most tragic if the High Sparrow, ""provisionally"" taking the Iron Throne because of the will of the Gods, finally decides to gather the royal army to march north against the armies of the dead, only for Cersei to burn the High Sparrow, the army, and the rest of King's Landing, in Green Flame, quashing what little apparent hope remained for Westeros to survive.",25,27,False,self,,,,,

I've read countless posts and discussions on the future of the books/show, possible plots, and their predictability-- specifically, how this predictability suggests that some of these foreshadowed/theorized plot lines may not occur, or that some people don't want them to occur because of this predictability. But this is what bothers me: what is predictable to us is NOT predictable to the casual reader/watcher. I think we forget that we are not in the majority or general population of consumers for this media franchise (they are probably the same people that keep The Big Bang Theory on tv). GRRM and D&amp;D both have a general audience that will not see some of these ""predictable"" plot lines coming, thus making them valid options in the future. While I'm sure GRRM has had the entire story mapped out in his head for years, I do believe we will get more and more variation between the show and books as the story progresses (i.e. character omissions, new characters, possibly a variation of GRRM's book ending-- like the Gone Girl movie/book ending). Despite this, the major plot lines will still stay intact (yes, even the seemingly predictable ones). We can't forget that both GRRM and D&amp;D are telling a story-- a fucking phenomenal story-- thats their main goal. Our extremely informed perspectives are blinding us to this fact. Some ""predictable"" plot lines will come true because it will be GOOD STORYTELLING.

Just as an example, there have been a number of posts in regard to Jon Snow, his possible resurrection, and his future role in GRRM's epic fantasy. I personally believe he will be back (and this would be an example of a major plot line that GRRM and D&amp;D would not differ on) as Azor Ahai reborn and be an integral part of A Song of Ice and Fire (if not as the physical manifestation of Ice and Fire itself, R+L=J), but many people believe in some alternatives-- possibly more than one person being Azor Ahai, someone else less predictable being Azor Ahai altogether (i.e. Jorah), or even Jon Snow becoming the story's ultimate villain. Here's the thing, while these may be cool plot twists to see play out, they would make for a horrible and unsatisfying story. Jon Snow, the bastard of the north, turning out to be a Targ, possibly making him the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and a prophesied reincarnation of a legendary hero who is supposed to save the world, IS THAT NOT A HUGE PLOT TWIST IN ITSELF? Jon has never been simply a bastard, but this would still be an amazing character arc. So pretend you are a general watcher/reader, you might have seen a hint or clue here or there-- maybe a specific shot of Jon through the flames, the use of a capital ""S"" by a certain witch, a blue flower on the Wall, a promise, a dream-- but you never really put them together because what purely casual reader/watcher would really put all of these hints together perfectly to create this incredible (and most likely true) theory? At least not until the second read/watch, which the general audience would not do. A theory like this might make sense to the general audience in hindsight, but not before. Basically, Jon Snow has to come back, and his future should not be judged because it seems too ""predictable."" Jon Snow is GRRM's hero, his Luke Skywalker, his Jesus. He is the key to the endgame of A Song of Ice and Fire. He is on the Hero's Journey and will continue on that same path. IT'S GOOD FUCKING STORYTELLING.

This subreddit is the equivalent to those people who guessed that Darth Vader was Luke's father after making the Vater/Father connection in the German language. Did that clever name stop that reveal from being arguably the greatest cinematic reveal of all time?? Not at all.

If any of you are wondering, I don't believe Jon will simply destroy all evil (this isn't LOTR), rather he will bring a balance to the world (Ice and Fire) probably through sacrificing himself in some way. GRRM has said that it will be a bittersweet ending, and that endgame seems pretty bittersweet to me. Also, I believe Dany is a prime example of either dying a hero, or living long enough to become the villain. She'll definitely be a part of the endgame, but not as a savior.

TL;DR or whatever: Jon Snow's story and future may be predictable to us at this point, but its not to the general audience. It's amazing storytelling that I am incredibly excited to both read and see on-screen, and you should be too.

(I might have just wrote this to reassure myself that Jon Snow is coming back because I'm secretly crying on the inside)

Alright this was fun but I've been writing this for the past 20 min, I'm a little buzzed, and I wan't to eat my Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos, drink more beer, and watch The West Wing now.
