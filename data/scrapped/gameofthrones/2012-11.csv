So let's rank each house from the start of each book including TWOW. The houses I used were:

Stark

Lannister

Arryn

Tully

Targaryren

Bolton

Frey

Martell

Tyrell

Baratheon

Greyjoy

If I missed any house let me know. Tag each book as spoilers please. I will post my rankings in the comments.

Many of you complain about Danys eyebrows, but I want to defend their honor. As a natural blonde, my eyebrows are darker than my head of hair. This is very common for people with fair hair. But I dont mean to draw a fallacyyou may say that just because something is natural doesnt make it good. True.

But let me show you something. Please look [here](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maylg4VEGA1qg6ri4o1_400.jpg) and [here](http://www.beautyrsvp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gucci.jpg) and [here](http://livesofstyle.com/thelastword/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brow1.jpg) at these photos of light blonde women with matched eyebrows. The look has been popular in high fashion for a couple years now. It is known. To me, the effect is slightly nightmarish.

Eyebrows define our eyes, enhance expression, and divide the forehead. Not only do I think the GOT stylists have it accurate with Dany, I think they have it right. A bleached brow would disservice her gorgeous eyes and bone structure. 

Please discuss.

Edit: Because some people have asked, I think every few days I see people getting all plucky about this (indulge me the pun) in threads. In fact, I don't think I've seen a single photo of Emilia that doesn't have some eyebrow raising (there I go again) hair and brow comments.

I don't imagine I need to tag this post.

I've watched all of the TV show so far, and I'm halfway through the 2nd book.  Martin has made it clear that the Night's Watch shows fealty to no king, and does not get involved in any wars.  My understanding is that they operate quite apart from the rest of Westeros.  One would expect, then, that if the deserter were sent to Stark, he would send him to Mormont to be dealt with.

TL;DR: Why does Ned dispatch the deserter in the beginning of the saga...Why not Mormont, the head of the Night's Watch? What authority does Ned have over the order, other than being Lord of the closest house to the Wall?

After doing a little research, I've listed the etymology of some of the major character's names. Since G.R.R.M. took some liberties with the spelling of the names, I had to use derivative names or similar names for some characters, so some are a bit of a stretch. I'm not implying that G.R.R.M. intentionally named characters based on these meanings or that there are any connections at all for some of them, but they're interesting to think about.

I suggest 9PM EST so West Coast folk can participate.  A lot of episode discussion threads (for any show) start with the East Coast viewing time, meaning West Coasters can't join in.  If enough Westies would prefer a 7PM start, pushing it back to 10PM EST, and the Easties don't mind...

**NOTE** Since this is a *re-watch* thread, it means you can pretty much guarantee there will be spoilers.  If you haven't watched the series before, it is recommended you *not* participate.

It is great for many reasons, but one of these is that it is the story of people. Yes, there are dragons and giants and other such fantastical creatures, but mostly there are people placed in difficult situations who simply try to survive in a world that is not meant for the weak. 
This is what separates this saga from so many fantasy novels and series - it doesn't concentrate on the magic sword. It is not the story if a hero that was oh-so-normal up until he (or she) discovers that (a) they are actually a wizard and (b) the'yre long time friend is actually a (slightly) less powerful wizard that will guide them in the process of gaining power to overthrow the evil dictator that destroyed the peace x number of years ago. In GOT, there is a usurper, but it's our favorite characters best friend! Yeah he's fat and lazy and is quite honestly a bad king but he is not evil. He's just a person. 
When Emile Zola first published his radical novel ""Nana"" in the late 1800s, a story of a prostitute who ultimately ends up killing herself, it was labelled ""shocking"" and ""pornographic"". It belonged to a literary movement known as realism - a movement which discussed pressing social issues by examining people's real life and writing about it in great detail. It did not omit the 'shocking' material because Zola was making a point: THIS is what life was really like. This is why we need to fix it. 
Martin is hardly a realist. There are no dragons in realism. But neither are there heros. Nana is not, by today's standards, pornographic. It briefly describes the physiology of the human form and that's it. Today, Martin's work is described in the same manner. People refuse to read it on the grounds that it is graphically violent and pornographic and that it is artificially put in to sell better. Well, maybe it is. But I believe that Martin is using his own brand of realism. He makes no attempt to glorify war and all the misery that goes with it (unlike Tolkien whose battles are all just). He reminds us that there are two sides to every battle by making us love the Starks but also Tyrion and Jamie. Danerys *hates* Ned. People we love hate each other. This is the way Martine reminds us that characters are meant to be people, not heros.            ",20,58,False,self,,,,,

Gendry says that his mother was yellow headed. Most likely, this is a hint that if Gendry was dark headed with a yellow headed mother, then perhaps it is likely Robert's 'trueborn' children are in fact not, being just as yellow as their mother. Given future events, that makes much more sense than what I am about to suggest.  
  
What if Gendry is Robert's only trueborn child? He says his mother was yellow headed, so maybe Cersei. I can't remember reading this, but I know that in the show, Cersei claims she lost her first son. What if she didn't lose him? What if something caused her to want to get rid of him. Robert could have been told he died.  
  
So I guess the questions are: What do we know about that first child? Do we know any Lannister supporters that are ""stout, round of shoulder...brown beard [with] a bit of red in it""? Do any of these favor the colors purple and silver, perhaps in a sigil?

**Azor Ahai Theories**
---
*Who do you think could be AA?  Why are the other theories wrong?*
---

---

**Background info for discussion:**

Azor Ahai was a legendary hero who lived approximately eight thousand years before Aegon's Landing. It is said that during the midst of The Long Night, Azor Ahai rose up and defeated the Others, wielding a sword of fire, called Lightbringer. 

According to prophecy, in ancient books of Asshai from over five thousand years ago, Azor Ahai is to be reborn again as The Prince that was Promised to challenge the Others. This will occur after a long summer when an evil, cold darkness descends upon the world. It is said that The Prince that was Promised, wielding Lightbringer once again, will stand against the Others and if he fails, the world fails with him.

**The Prophecy:**

*""There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.""*

Anyone have any other suggestions for music to listen to whilst I feverishly read into the wee hours of the morning? It can be anything there is not much music I dislike. 

I've tried this band I dug in high school called Murder By Death (they are incredible and it's fairly fitting), and I've listening to a lot of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds but sadly I've run out of ideas... Should I just break out the Tom Waits and be done with it? I love me some Tom Waits. Your suggestions would be a great help!

So let us talk about brother of the late king Robert: Stannis Baratheon, lord of Dragonstone and other titles.

I really like his character. Not because he is a nice guy, but because i can respect him for what he does, talking about what makes him do what he does. He is all about about what is right according to the law of Westeros. He does not act for his own good. 

A couple of examples: 
[ACOK](/b ""When Davos saved him during Robert's rebellions, while Stannis was holding Storm's end, he punished and rewarded the onion knight at the same time. By cutting of the fingers on Davos his hand for the smuggling and raising him to knight for saving the keep."") Stannis did this because it was the proper thing to do. It was according the law.

[ACOK](/b ""Stannis doesn't want to be king. still he is fighting for it because he is the rightful heir according the law."") This shows again that he will always put the law before himself and I kind of respect him for that. He will always do what is just, whatever the issue. He is not cruel of greedy, he is a just man.

Besides that, he is also someone who fights with his man on the battlefield. So yeah, I would't mind having him on the throne, even though he is kind of a dick.

Notes - 

This is a re-watch thread, so, **it is very likely there will be spoilers**.  If you have not watched through the final episode of Season 2, you should probably not look in here.

Similarly **please do not spoil events in the books**, or use spoiler tags if you must.  How to use spoiler tags are listed on the right side of this page.  

Finally, **we'll start watching at 7PM PST, 10PM EST**, and whatever that works out to in whatever other time zones.  Google ""what time is it"" in order to get the ""correct"" time, so we're all more-or-less in synch.

Okay, actually this is finally - one of the mods messaged me and said they were going to do this, but they were very vague as to whether this was going to be a general discussion thread, or a ""let's all watch together"" thread.  I messaged them earlier, with no response so far, which is why I'm creating this thread.

So who do you think can (realistically) be cast for what roles? Also, some changes from books to tv have to be made because they either do not translate from one medium to the other or it would be prohibitively expensive to recreate parts of the books. What changes would you make to allow the show to go on?


IMO
3 eyed crow- Peter O'Toole. Biggest star to join the cast since Sean Bean. He worked with the producers in Troy and is old enough. Plus they have indicated they have the budget flexibility to get a bigger star. It is not a huge role but would require a lot of time in a make up chair. O'Toole would be in his early 80s by the time shooting would begin.
Other possibles- Christopher Lee, Any stage actor born before 1940

Cold Hands- uncredited. Pretty much the only way to not give anything away. Or the actor is uncredited and they give the voice actor a credit. 
Other possibilities- pretty much none that would not spoil things if certain theories are true.

Euron Greyjoy- David Bamber worked with producers in the past. Can be made up to look like a Greyjoy.
Other possibilities- Hugh Bonneville, James Purefoy

Victarion- James Purefoy. Has worked with producers before and I doubt his midseason replacement drama that he is currently involved with gets renewed. 
Other Possibilities- Ray Stevenson

Red Viper- Elijah Wood... he's a huge fan of the show and this seems like a small enough role to fit into his schedule. 
Other candidates- Bradley Whitford, Francesco Coco

Changes for the sake of cinematography


The yet unresolved Mance Raydar story line would be cut or changed considerably in like three seasons. It works for the books, but would be kind of stupid for TV.

~20% or more of the minor characters from the books are cut completely. Cast is already huge, don't need to spiral costs or recast minor characters.

Possible minor spoiler, but only if you are really really picky, Mance's musical talent is portrayed in such a way that Cirian Hinds wins a ton of Emmy awards. Same goes for the drummer from Coldplay. And really, more production aspects are done in ways that will win awards.

One of my friends bought them the other day, they go way beyond the current in-book maps, and they are official. 

Some things that they include are:
 - Some random island west of the iron islands called ""Lonely Light"" which I think is neat.

 - A fourth continent. Including Westeros, Essos, and Sothoryos, there is a continent in the far south-east (just south of Asshai and the shadowlands) called Ulthos

 - Very expansive maps of essos east of slavers bay, including several cities, islands, and towns never mentioned before, and in the north, Ib, which actually has 4 cities.

 - Also, there are a couple of detailed city maps. One of King's Landing, and one of Braavos.

In any case, I am definitely going to go and buy them next week.

Here's a link to some preview pics:

The following is what resulted:


Warning: This contains spoilers for multiple books in the series. 


Some Knights


Some knights are Lannisters of Casterly Rock

Some knights still support Aegon

Some knights wish their ship could raid a castle

Some knights know that winter has come


But your Other wakes up, I still see your form

Rhollor, Im still not sure about Melisandre

Oh MelisandreOh Melisandre

Most knights dont know whos dead anymore


Arya:

This is it Joff, this is warwhatd you threaten my direwolf for?

Lets use the pointy end already.

I was never one to be ladylikeleft my eyes in the House of Black and White

The Greyjoys will never stay on Pyke, but here Theon comes to take back his isle


Tyrion: 

And heres my plight: I found Shae in my fathers bed tonight

I strangled her with my own chain of handsthe hand, the hand, the hand

Oh patricide? mmmmmm


Well some knights fight for Daenerys Targaryen

They want to see some dragons for a change

And some knights wish for Baratheons again

For some knights, Stannis wins, Stannis wins


But your Other wakes up, I still see your form

Rhllor, Im still not sure about Melisandre.

Who is Melisandre? Who is Melisandre?

Most knights look down on Crows.


Catelyn:

So this is it? I lost my life for this?

Lost my tongue and died for this?

I miss my sons and Ned for this?


John:

No. When I see Starks, when I see, when I see Starks, thats all they are.

When I hear Crows, they sound like I do, so Im in .

Oh, Im in. Oh Im in. Oh, Im in. 



Myrcella:

Well this is it Arys, you fellfive minutes in and Im alone again

Twelve years of life, Im not sure of anybodys designs

This one is not for the folks at home; Sorry to leave mom, I seek the throne

Why the fuck did Arys have to die for me all dried up in the desert sun?


Jamie:

My oath is breaking for my sister because she calls me love

When I look into my nephews eyes

Man, you wouldnt believe my children are kings all because of

Circes lies


Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh


Bran (to his direwolf):

Summer, you wouldnt believe the green dream I had about you and me

I ran with you, but as you can see

I cant go the distance

I wish I werent crippledoh

I cant go the distance

I wish I werent crippledoh

(HINT: If someone posts, ""Darth Vador is my favourite Game of Thrones character!"" and you reply with, **""You know nothing, Jon Snow.""** That STILL counts as a spoiler, however subtle it may be.)

I thought /r/gameofthrones was a subreddit dedicated to the television show, and /r/asongoficeandfire was for people to discuss the books in as much detail as they want. Would be nice if there *was* a subreddit for people who have only seen the television series (let me know if there is). I wish I had the time to devour thousands of pages of this wonderful story - but I just don't. 

I hope this doesn't come off as bitching.

She gets caught up in a romance with Daario even though she knows she can't be marryin' dat fool, like a girl in high school who falls for some attractive dickweed even though she knows he's bad for her. She tried to save Mereen despite all the evidence and people telling her that she should leave, like a teenager clinging desperately to a soul-sucking social environment despite ""real friends"" elsewhere. She eventually disappears off into the distance with Drogon and has to learn how to truly fend for herself without anyone else there, very similar to a teenager going off to college. 

What I'm saying is that while Daenerys has made some pretty shit decisions, none of them are out of character for what we've been given, not to mention the possibility of Targeryan madness. She is similar Cersei in this way for me, she seems like a character who is doing what that character would do, and while I might not approve personally, it fits with the arc and the storytelling style overall. So why do so many people seem to hate her as a character? 

If it's just because of the whole personal disapproval thing then I understand, but I tend to separate the character and their story from everything that I would say/do if I knew them personally and try to view it from a larger story context.

-------------------------

Ok so I know they have already filmed and probably edited all of season three but I've always thought it would be cool for the Red Wedding to be presented this way:

Yadda Yadda the twins foreshadowing etc.

Cat notices the Frey who doesnt want to dance with Mormont (i think it was) and gets all suspicious. 

All other audio fades out except for Cat sounds and that particular Freys sound as she runs up to him. They pull the big reveal (either the armor under his clothes or he draws a sword to make it super obvious) 

She turns around to yell and warn Robb. Full body shot of Robb. All audio now silent except for the THUMP of an arrow into his back, and subsequent grunting and staggering (close up of Cat lookin all dismayed). This could all be done combined with jumping back and forth to Arya and Sandor arguing about what to do outside  

Directly following the arrow THUMP all audio gone... 

then just one voice, ""And who are you, the proud lord said/ That I should bow so low?""



The song is the only audio now and it plays over slowmo shots of northerners fighting/getting killed in the hall, in the camp. (Maybe outside a shot of someone geting his head lobbed off right behind the hound as they argue and arya looks all surprised to start that whole bit in motion) 

eventually the songs volume is turned down for heart crushing deliverances of ""Grey wind"" ""go to him"" ""not my hair ned loved my hair"" (all in real time ofc) etc. 

Song ends back at full volume ""And now the rains weep o'er his halls/ with no one there to hear"". Right after""Hear"" a running Arya gets an ambiguous smack to the head from behind.

Because while theyre at it they might as well lose all viewership.

In ASOS, Tyrion III:

""It would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly,"" said Tyrion bluntly. The Westerlings stood to lose everything here; their lands, their castle, their very lives. A Lannister always pays his debts.

""Jeyne Westerling is her mother's daughter,"" said Lord Tywin, ""and Robb Stark is his father's son.""

This Westerling betrayal did not seem to have enraged his father as much as Tyrion would have expected. Lord Tywin did not suffer disloyalty in his vassals. He had extinguished the proud Reynes of Castamere and the ancient Tarbecks of Tarbeck Hall root and branch when he was still half a boy. The singers had even made a rather gloomy song of it. Some years later, when Lord Farman of Faircastle grew truculent, Lord Tywin sent an envoy bearing a lute instead of a letter. But once he'd heard ""The Rains of Castamere"" echoing through his hall, Lord Farman gave no further trouble. And if the song were not enough, the shattered castles of the Reynes and Tarbecks still stood as mute testimony to the fate that awaited those who chose to scorn the power of Casterly Rock. ""The Crag is not so far from Tarbeck Hall and Castamere,"" Tyrion pointed out. ""You'd think the Westerlings might have ridden past and seen the lesson there.""

""Mayhaps they have,"" Lord Tywin said. ""They are well aware of Castamere, I promise you.""

""Could the Westerlings and Spicers be such great fools as to believe the wolf can defeat the lion?""

Every once in a very long while, Lord Tywin Lannister would actually threaten to smile; he never did, but the threat alone was terrible to behold. ""The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them,"" he said ...

From this perspective, Im pretty sure that the Westerlings were used in Tywin plan to destroy the Starks with one strike. If not, why Tywin woudnt be mad at the Westerling? Tywin was well aware of Robb honor, and on the fact that he woudnt want to shame a girl from a noble house.

Also, it might be possible that Jeyne itself loved Robb, and the betrayal was only from her mother. Which would not contradicted the theory that the girl Jamie sees in AFFC is not the real Jeyne but a fake. In this case, the real Jeyne would most probably be pregnant with Robb child and under the protection of the Blackfish. ",12,12,False,self,,,,,

849,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-11-24,2012,11,24,11,13p2ks,self.gameofthrones,"I'm about halfway through ASOS, and I've got a few thoughts on ""spoilers""... [Marked Spoilers]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/13p2ks/im_about_halfway_through_asos_and_ive_got_a_few/,BrusselsSproutCobler,1353724165,"As of right now, I'm only on page 530 of A Storm of Swords. Obviously I've enjoyed it so far and I can see why everyone praises it so highly. It's exciting, it's got some cool plot lines going on, and there've already been a couple moments that surprised me and had me on the edge of my seat. I entirely expected the scene [ASOS](/b ""where the Hound fights Beric,"") to end with [ASOS](/b ""the Hound dying ""). It didn't, and it was awesome. That being said, if someone had told me the outcome before I read it, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much. There is a certain thrill to not knowing when things are going to happen, and having specific scenes or events spoiled ahead of time definitely does make them less exciting. 

When I caught up to where the show is by reading GoT and CoK, the events that were *awesome* on the show were only *enjoyable* to read in the book. There was no rush to figure out what was going to happen next, so when they did happen, things like [CoK](/b ""Renly's death"") or even [CoK](/b ""the battle of Blackwater Bay"") were only interesting and fresh in so far as the differences between the show and book, the internal dialogues that the characters had, and the crazy good descriptions that Martin writes. I'm not saying that it was a bad time reading them, and I definitely understand more of the characters and their houses than if I had just watched the show, all I'm trying to say is that it's not as good of a time reading if you know what's going to happen.

I also believe however that there is more to it than just saying that spoilers are bad and will always ruin a good time. I, for one, have heard at least a few things about what's coming up next in this great book, and I'm still as pumped as ever to get to them. Apparently there is some kind of [Major ASOS Event](/b ""Red Wedding?"") coming up, but I don't know what is going to happen there, and I don't know why it's such a big deal to everyone here. I don't mind having heard the phrase, because [ASOS](/b ""just about everybody is getting married in this book""). I have no idea which [ASOS](/b ""wedding"") is the one everyone talks about, so it really hasn't been spoiled for me at all. Disaster could strike these characters at any minute essentially. I've also heard that a [ASOS](/b ""certain song"") will be [ASOS](/b ""played"") at this event, so I can make some guesses but nothing is certain yet.

Basically, all I'm trying to say here is that spoilers do hurt people's good time, but they're not the end of the world. Unless someone gives a detailed description of the clever dialogue between characters and the exact moment that something happens, you can still enjoy the expertise  and care with which this series has been written. The book is still there waiting to be read, even if you know one or two of the things that are going to happen in it. It's not quite as good of an experience, and I'll curse any spoiler-er to the seven hells along with the rest of you, but I also realize that there is more to this song than just a collection of events and character deaths. So be careful what you say when discussing this series online, but also realize that if you've read or heard something you shouldn't have, you can still make the most of it and enjoy the books anyways. There is no way that *everything* in them was spoiled for you. 

Unless you went deep into the Wiki. Then you are truly lost.

Notably, the ones between [Season 1](/s ""Varys and Little Finger"") and then [Season 2](/s ""Arya and Tywin "").

I think there are a lot of interesting possibilities for the new season.  I would love to see a scene (or several) with the Queen of Thorns and Tywin; honestly, I could watch an entire episode of the two characters interacting.  I would also love to see Tywin interact with Joffrey (a new source of slaps for the boy king?) and knock some sense into him.

Some big events we already have strong suspicions about their placement (RW in ep. 9), but how do you think the show will breakdown the story/change things to make it work? 

Some thoughts:

 - Ep. 1: Meet Mance Rayder, Jojen and Meera, Selyse and Shireen, and see Riverrun for the first time and meet Edmure and the Blackfish. 
Attack on the Fist of the First Men. Lord Commander Mormont will be found by Sam as the battle is ending, make his exit. 
Probably check in on most of the characters, but not all. 
Possibly meet Arstan Whitebeard. 
Last shot of the episode: Davos emerging from a cave on the shore of Blackwater Bay, looking bedraggled but very much alive. 

 - Ep. 2: Guess who's back? Back again? Davos will return to Dragonstone, ready to take on Melisandre. 
If Arstan wasn't in ep. 1, he'll be introduced here. 
Check in on King's Landing, Tyrion will be shut out of scheming by Tywin.
Arya will meet the Brotherhood.

 - Ep. 3: Jon and Ygritte's tension just keeps getting higher, Jon will try to find out Mance's plans. 
Jaime and Brienne will be caught by whoever catches them (Locke?).
Last shot of the episode: sword coming down, Jaime's scream. 

 - Ep. 4: ??? 
Probably introduce Daario, if he hasn't shown up yet. 

 - Ep. 5: Episode 5 is usually a game changer episode (Ned's fight with Jaime in s.1 and Renly and the shadow-demon in s.2).  
Arstan is revealed!
Jon and Ygritte will have some fun times in the caves. 
The Lannister attack on Riverrun that Edmure defends against, Robb and The Blackfish get angry. 
Execution of Rickard Karstark. 
Tyrion will be informed he must marry Sansa. 

 - Ep. 6: ???
The Hound's fight with Beric Dondarrion, though this could happen later. 
Burning leeches?

 - Ep. 7: Weddings? I love weddings! 
Sansa and Tyrion's wedding. 
Robb will inform Edmure that he must marry Roslin Frey. 
Daenerys decides she needs the Unsullied, will do anything to get them. 

 - Ep. 8: ???
 Arya and the Hound on the road. 
The wildlings will prepare to climb the Wall, Jon's making plans for his escape.

 - Ep. 9: The Red Wedding. This episode will probably be closer to s.1's ""Baelor"", checking in on several storylines, rather than like s.2's ""Blackwater"" and stay in one location, but it could go either way. 

 - Ep. 10: Mhysa! Mhysa! 
The battle at the Wall will be saved for s.4, so we'll get the fight at Queenscrown after the wildlings scale the Wall. Ygritte will probably die here, Jon will ride off, and Bran will almost get caught in the middle of all of it.
Osha decides not to go back North, leaves with Rickon. 
Davos will read Stannis a letter.
Jaime saves Brienne from the bear pit. 
Arya leaves the Hound.

But I'm confused by several bits of exposition, which I think were all first conveyed early in the pilot episode.

Specifically, we find out that concurrent with the story's beginning there has been a recent influx of, um, undocumented immigrants crossing the border in pursuit of a better life (ie one with fewer blue-eyed ice zombies).

But...ok...how are the Wildings getting past the 700ft wall, exactly? Concealed behind false panels in SUVs? Chutes and ladders? Big-ass trampolines?

It can't be too complex, right? 'Cause apparently dire wolves know this trick too.

And I guess you can add the Night's Watch gang to the list, since JoeBob the deserter survives the white walker encounter and heads south - without interacting with his coworkers at the fortified border crossing.

On-screen, though, the entire season unspools and nobody seems to think this is noteworthy. Worrying about civilization-ending invasion of the undead? Sorta-yes. Worrying that the freakin' trees are practically the only things not already magically traversing their Maginot line? Noooope. (Or maybe the guards' union is just saving that issue for leverage at their next contract negotiations?)

I'd assume this is just one giant, 700ft plot hole - and it feels like one, rather than an omission - except that Game of Thrones is otherwise more or less logically self-consistent, and obviously written for an adult audience. What gives? Is this addressed in the books? 2nd season?

*edit: This comes across as more sarcastic than intended. Honestly, my assumption was that - because GoT is a great series - I was just unaware of/overlooking something.*

Because I've apparently been living under a rock, I missed out on this excellent [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/11wmiq/spoilers_from_winteriscomingnet/). Winteriscoming.net answered questions about season 3. The one I am referring to is: 

&gt;**do you know if Talisa will be present at RW - will they change how it is in the books or leave her out of it?** She'll be there.

Most comments were complaining that it isn't a logical choice to have Robb's wife at the Twins, and the show should focus on the mother/son dynamic. 

However, it never even occurred to me that Talisa would be there as Robb's wife. I've always assumed she was planted by the Lannisters to seduce Robb into betraying the Freys. What if she's there and gets some sick pleasure out of her success? 


I really wanted to discuss this but that thread is a month old.

Also, if I'm wrong and she's there as his wife and there is a Romeo/Juliet thing going on, I am going to shit bricks and throw them at the writers if Robb dies defending her. I think the episode should be about shock value and betrayal, not how two young lovers tragically lost their lives. ",25,10,False,self,,,,,

I, being a avid little reader----

**I HAVE NOT READ ADoD YET, do not ruin it for me or i will send a thousand crows to peck out your innards**

--Anyways being an avid little reader I was able to guess most of them. One of my fraternity brothers, who does not read the series, comes over with his girlfriend who is dressed as Arya. I reveal as much when i say ""hey great arya costume, where is needle"" (she also had a plush Nymeria on her shoulder, name tag and all).

She proceeds to get a little dumpy with me because her boyfriend couldn't guess her costume and they had a wager, and i had clearly ruined it.

My brother, the boyfriend, would later tell me, when she was out of ear shot, that if he could guess it by the end of the night she would do anything he wanted *wink wink nudge nudge.* If she won he had to read the first book and pamper her all day with a back and foot massage, breakfast in bed, the works.

He had been guessing peter pan, Oliver twist, Katniss, and a bunch of other such characters, and the rest of the fraternity bros who have read the series or seen the show had gotten wind of the bet and played along. 

Anyways, because i had ruined the wager, and because i agree he should read the books, i was apart of the negotiation where it was decided that yes, i ruined the wager, but he still did win as she didnt say no help. To compromise i sided with the girlfriend that he should read the books, and then with him that he still wins the bet (still gotta wingman for the bro).

For the next week i heard very little from him, i figured he was busy milking his rewards, but then i saw his girlfriend. She was kind of disappointed because after claiming his just rewards for two nights in a row he wasnt really paying attention to her as much. I told her how i hadn't seen him around either and i was worried about him. She tells me ""oh no, he is fine, he is just reading the books."" So i pop over his place later that day and sure enough he is reading book 2... (he read book 1 faster than me)

I just ask ""so you like the books so far?""

his response:

""Yo nigga, this shit got zombies""


Priceless


Fun fact, you can tell when he is reading the books because he texts you in George R.R. Martin meets Ye Olde English. When i brought it up he said ""thats nothing, you should see what i send Girlfriends Name"" *wink wink nudge nudge*

I, like many, muscled through the series just to get to the end and enjoy the ride. Now, on my second read, I'm planning on going a lot slower and trying to answer some of the questions I came up with at the end of my first read. One that I just came up with, and which I'd like to get opinions on, is the dragon's personalities. 

The dragons were born in the funeral pyre for Drogo, in which Drogo, Mirri, and (I assume) Dany's deceased newborn were laid to rest. The prevailing theory I've found is that, magically, Mirri's death was traded for the life of the three dragons and they were born in the fire. 

But what if it's a little bit more complicated than that? 

For those who have finished A Dance with Dragons, let's take a look at what we know. 

[Drogon](/b ""we know the dragons are feisty, to say the least. Drogon is uncontrollable and wild, supposedly murdering a child and then attacking the fighting pits. He makes his lair on the great grass sea and conquers and consumes all he sees and wants."") 

[Viserion](/b ""Viserion is controllable, to a point, and follows his mother's instruction to the letter, more or less. He's the one Dany unleashes on Slaver's Bay. Viserion is also the dragon which gives Dany the most comfort, citing the scene on Dany's terrace where he senses she is uneasy and he allows himself to be pet before he knocks a pear down for Dany and flies off, but not too distant to be out of range if she needs anything. He's also the first to be chained and desperately wants to be near Dany when she comes to see him."")

[Rhaegal](/b ""Rhaegal is the wildcard that we know very little about, aside from his appearance. Dany has Rhaegal on her shoulder when she petitions the leaders of Qarth, though, and fatally injures Quentyn."")

Does it seem to anyone else that the dragons are not just creations which were brought into the world through the death of three people but, instead, are the reincarnation/reimagining of each person whos life paid for their life? [](/g ""Drogon is Drogo, Khal of the Great Grass Sea and conqueror. Viserion is her son, the Stallion who Mounts the World, providing for and protecting his mother as she provides for and cares for him during his development. Rhaegal is Mirri Maz Duur, the one we know least about and who assists Dany with her political endeavors."") 

Am I taking crazy pills, or does anyone else see where I'm going?

Tyrion, in one of his chapters, makes a reference to the Trojan War: ""Words he had never meant to speak came tumbling out of him like mummers from a hollow horse.""

The obvious initial reading of this sentence is Tyrion likening his speech to being normally disguised as a gift but at the time being revealed with an alterior motive. This reading is likened to the tale of the Greeks attempting to penetrate the city of Troy in Homer's *The Illiad*. The Greeks offered a gift of a large wooden horse to the Trojans, seemingly in good faith, however the horse was filled with Greek soldiers that would evacuate the horse that night and destroy Troy from the inside. The reference to mummer's would be actors portraying *The Illiad* as a theatrical piece.

From this reading, are we to assume that our history is assumed knowledge by all characters in the story? Or do we treat the narrator as separated from the world, like a storyteller (the narrator being a conduit for characters' thoughts)? Or are we to assume that there is a tale similar to *The Illiad* that has occurred in the ""A Game of Thrones"" universe to which the narrator is referring?

Being a novice reader of the series, I have no knowledge of any statements George R. R. Martin has made regarding this, nor if there are more such references in further books.

What I would like to know is if we are supposed to take these statements for what they are, or attempt to infer something about the world as it may relate to ours. Personally, if my reading is correct and it makes an internal reference to the Trojan War, I think it could expand the stories exponentially to tie in with our own history and draw readers into *A Song of Ice and Fire* even more than it already does.

The man is a genius, master of intrigue, sly, witty, subtle, and above all, he has the political intelligence so obviously lacked by almost every single character in the series. He's cool, calm, collected, and utterly ruthless. He plays the GoT the way it should be played.

Personally, I believe Littlefinger's end game is the democratisation of Westeros. His sheer hatred for the Hereditary system of Lords and Ladies stems from him losing out to the love of his life, Catelyn. Off the top of my head, I can't recall ANY other series of well....ANYTHING, that has ever tried to deal with the revolution towards democracy in a fantasy world. 

Does anyone else think this would be such a brilliant development from GRRM? To have his fanbase squabbling for so many years about who will win 'The Game of Thrones' and sit the Iron Throne by the end, and then instead he abolishes the entire system!

* Also any ideas about Arya? She is one of my favourite characters and I'm still wondering how she ties in with the storyline, as she is across the narrow sea with years of training left before she could think of going back to Westeros. 
* [SPOILER ADWD] On the Wall Jon has just been stabbed, any ideas on what will happen to him? I think somehow Melisandre will bring him back to life just as Thoros of Myr did to Beric Dondarrion. (Also side not in Epilogue of ADWD Ser Keven thinks to himself, ""What must it be like up on the Wall?"" (right after Jon had been stabbed) and then reaches the rookery and is stabbed by children. Thought it interesting foreshadowing)

So....spoilers lay ahead.

It's evident to me that Varys and Illyrio ultimately serve the Targaryens, which is why Varys assassinated Kevan Lannister, in order to keep dissent growing between House Lannister and House Tyrell, to make Aegon's conquest of Westeros ultimately easier. And we know Illyrio was sheltering Viserys, Daenerys, and apparently Aegon from a young age, and orchestrated the marriage between Kahl Drogo and Daenerys because that would be the best way to seat Viserys on the Iron Throne.

What intrigues me however, is that when we see Varys and Illyrio's conversation beneath the Red Keep, Illyrio says he needs more time, that Kahl Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. Varys says he cannot contain the war that's brewing between the Wolf and the Lion, and tells Illyrio to make haste. They both agree that the game is too large for two players, and they mention Stannis and Lysa both fleeing to garner support for their own causes.

At this point, Varys laments Littlefinger's meddling. The fact that Littlefinger's lies manipulated Catelyn into abducting Tyrion, which in turn pisses off Jaime, Cercei, etc. ""Only the Gods know what game Littlefinger is playing.""

So I ask you guys...and feel free to spoil, mark them if you wish for others, but I have to know....what game *is* Littlefinger playing?!?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

There are many ancient houses in Westeros and before you narrow it down to the great houses hear me out.  A king is nothing without his bannermen, he's only able to support 4,000 troops max (In war time) and depending on the region each lord has a +1 on another.  Like how in the North the lords inspire valor within their men's hearts opposed to a southern lord (Well most of them) who use gold instead of words.  While I have no doubt that Greyjoy, Arryn, Lannister, Baratheon, Stark, Martell, Tyrell, and Tully are all powerful there are still lords that pose a threat.  First of think of the houses lord, Semly is a rather small house but because they have the same blood of Barriston The Bold the small folk (who in the end play a big part in the GoT) are more often than not friendly.  The second thing to consider is the region where the house is located, it's said that Northern men are fiercer fighters than those of the south who in turn don't do well in the cold.  Finally consier the influence they have on other lords, /b for instance even though Renly was slain his influence over his greater bannermen led them to defeat Stannis his murderer.

In my own personal opinion House Redwyne is the most powerful house in Westeros.  There Lord is a clever man while there isn't much to draw from he's clever all the same.  The location of the Arbor could be no greater it's located on an island large enough to support itself and small enough to quickly get around if there was an enemy that needed a push into the sea.  Now this part is mere assumption but there is quite possibly a good relationship between the Arbor and oldtown (Second greatest port)  because of how close they are there is bound to be trade and each lord would attend the other's tourney's, Feasts simply because it was easy.
