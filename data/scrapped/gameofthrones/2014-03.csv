AFFC &amp; ADWD were not as quick... Yesterday, I came across this review of ADWD which summed up mine and a lot of my friends' feelings.

I'm Varamyr Sixskins. I'm here for the prologue to set us all up for the impending horrors of the North and all the excitement to come...

I'm Tyrion Lannister, the most popular character in all of Westeros! I spend this book meandering down a really slow river, ruminating bitterly about my life, misplacing my former charm, eroding all the goodwill I built up in the other books, and wondering where the whores go. Though perhaps I should have been wondering where the plot went. I also observe turtles and women, play board games, mouth off to all and sundry, and coincidentally run into various characters like some wandering monster in a D&amp;D campaign. Maybe I'll make it to Daenarys in the next book, but at least I ditched that pig.

I'm Asha Greyjoy. I don't have much to do, so I'll be the POV character keeping track of Stannis and his forces. At the beginning of Dance with Dragons, he's working his way towards Winterfell to take it back from the Boltons. At the end of Dance with Dragons, he's...working his way towards Winterfell to take it back from the Boltons. Hope that helps.

I'm Ser Davos Seaworth, the Onion Knight. I'm still running errands for Stannis and getting captured frequently. It's a living.

I'm Bran Stark. I am a tree.

I'm Daenarys Targaryen. I'm only a young girl, and I know little in the ways of war, governance, what have you. I used to think I said these things to misdirect people, but as of DoD it seems to be true. I spend my time taking baths, fretting, being wishy-washy, and mooning over this hot mercenary dude. In the end I learn that ""you have to go back to go forward."" I would have thought that going backwards would be the last thing that this book needs, but I am only a young girl and know little of the ways of story advancement.

I'm Aegon Targaryen. I appear for the first time in book five as the long thought dead son of Prince Rhaegar and the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. I know, right? What a surprise! It's like I was just pulled from thin air! I spend much of the book traveling to Daenarys, but then I change my mind and go and invade Westeros without her. Sort of. No one important has noticed yet. See you in the next book!

I'm Griff, aka Jon Connington. I'm here to get Aegon Targaryen on the Iron Throne. I tried to tell that kid not to wait until the fifth book to show up if he wants to be king. Now nobody's invested in us. We're like, peripheral characters or something. Nobody cares. I (sniff) just want someone to care, you know?

I'm Theon Greyjoy. Turns out I'm not dead, though I rather wish I were. It's been rough. On the bright side, my chapters were some of the only highlights of this bloated beast of a book. I even got to be almost a hero at the end! Can't wait for the next book. Redemption arc ahoy! People like me now!

Tyrion: Settle down sailor. You're not really a major character, and people still don't like you.

I'm Jaime Lannister. I snuck in to steal a chapter just like I would steal a kiss from my sweet sister. Oh look, there's Brienne! She's not dead after all. Whatever could have happened? Oops, we gotta go now, so I'll guess we'll never know. Blink and you'll miss us!

I'm Ser Robert coughGregorcough Strong coughnot deadcough. Gregor SMASH!

I'm the Hound. You know, I strongly suspect that I might not be dead either.

Tyrion: Quiet, you. No one even mentions you in this book.

I'm Wyman Manderly. I'm a minor character, but I bring a bit of awesome anyway. I was last seen bleeding from a neck wound. I wonder if I'll die. Your guess is as good as the author's.

I'm Jon Snow. I command the wall and defend Westeros from the horrors of the North. I count sides of beef and sausages, receive messages, meet with my staff, greet newcomers, and find bedrooms for all the wildings. Seriously, am I a commander or a butler? It's the end of the book already, we need some action! I'll march on Winterfell and retake it from the cursed Boltons! Away we go! Oh, dang it. Stabbed from all sides. There goes that plan. It sure does seem like I'll die now...

I'm Quentyn Martell. I'm kind of a side plot that has no impact at all on the main story. Then I die. But the good news is that I really am dead for sure!

I'm Melisandre. I get a chapter where I play with fire and see things and act all cryptic with people. Well, I have to amuse myself somehow. It's booorrring at the wall.

I'm Victarion Greyjoy. Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main! This book will end Before I meet Daenarys Targaryen!

I'm Areo Hotah. Don't worry, I don't really remember who I am either. Not much to see here, anyway.

I'm Cersei Lannister. I get two chapters of humiliation. Can I have some of Theon's reader sympathy now? No? Well then. I won't forget this. A Lannister always pays his debts...maybe in the next book.

I'm Arya Stark. I'm in two chapters, too, and I kill someone, like I always do. But this time it's different; this time someone told me to. That's progress. Maybe someday I'll kill someone who has something to do with the main story.

I'm Barristan Selmy. I putter around Meereen, trying in some small way to advance the plot. Alas, to little avail. I'm too old for this.

I'm Kevan Lannister. I waited a thousand pages for a POV and all I got was this lousy epilogue and a quarrel in the chest. Oh well. At least I'm well and truly done with this mess.

Varys: Maybe.
We're the Others. We are the horror of the North and theoretically the real Big Bad Threat in this series. It's five books in, and we still haven't really gotten to do anything yet. To be honest, we're too bored to bother any more. We're going to invade Canada instead and subdue them to our icy will. Apologies everyone!

Did you guys feel the same way about ADWD? I am confident TWOW will be a return to form &amp; GRRM is taking so much time with Winds of Winter because he wants to ensure it reaches the quality of ASOS. What are your opinions?

A special thanks to the Wiki of Ice and Fire for a bit of the finer details and names...  And with that being said let's get to it...

**- Conciliation and the long reign of Jaehaerys I**

When we last left off in our discovery of the Targaryen family, the royal family was in the midst of a small, yet violent conflict with the Faith of the Seven who was opposing the legitimacy Targaryen rule based of the incestious births of both King Aenys I and King Maegor I.  While Maegor's tatics were brutal in dealing with the faith militant; he failed to quell the uprising before his death, and as Maegor failed to have any children of his own the throne went to his nephew Jaehaerys I, who as we discussed in the last installment was originally passed over after the death of his father Aenys in favor of his Uncle. One of Jaehaerys I's first acts upon ascending to the throne was to make peace with the Faith of the Seven and end the conflict.  The Faith agreed to lay down their arms, disband the Faith Militant (meaning they would acquiesce to Mageor's Law, forbidding clergy from being armed), and dissallowed the Faith from holding trials, if the King would always vow to defend the faith from it's enemies.  The result of this is still seen in the current series, among his or her many titles the ruler of Westeros takes the tile ""...and defender of the faith"".  This act of ending the Faith Militant uprising is known as ""The Conciliation"" and earned Jaehaerys his nickname ""The Conciliator""..

And thus began a near 60 year rule for perhaps the best remembered, and longest lasting King Westeros has ever had.. (and bestowing his other nickname ""The Old King"" upon him) During his time as king he is loved for his use of diplomacy in affairs of the state, and giving the realm it's longest lasting peace during the duration of his reign.  Some of his more notable deeds consist of treating with, and ending the centuries lasting conflict between house Bracken and Blackwood, taking a man of humble birth (a blacksmiths son) as his hand of the king, ushered the building of the Kingsroad (partially due to the frequency of his traveling), and giving the Night's watch additional land south of the Wall for their use; now known as the ""New Gift""

While Jaehaerys I is fondly remembered in Westeros, it could be argued that his wife Alysanne was even more beloved.  As the sister/wife of the  King, no Queen has had as much influence on the realm or as much love from her King as ""Good Queen Alysanne"".  One particular deed she is most remembered for is to convince King Jaehaerys to abolish the custom of the ""Lords Right to the First Night"".  An ancient custom, practiced especially among those with bloodlines of the First Men, that stated as a lord you have the right and privilege to bed any bride under their banner on her wedding night, whether it be a low born miller's wife, to the wife of a leal lord.  Queen Alysanne was so offended by the practice that the King abolished it altogether.... And thus was the reign of Jaeharys I and his queen, it wasn't until the later years of Jaehaery I's reign that some issues began to plague him, the king was getting old and the issue of who would inherit the throne upon his death became less clear.

**-Naming an heir and the Great Council of 101AL**

While known for a long reign, Jaehaerys, unlike his uncle Maegor, did have heirs... In fact it was during his reign that House Targaryen flourished and their numbers swelled to perhaps it's peak during the entire Dynasty.  However it was upon the death of Jaehaerys' first son Aemon in 92AL that a concern over succession developed.  If the laws of succession had been followed strictly, the King's grandaughter, and only known child of Aemon, Rhaenys Targaryen (named after one of the conqueror's sisters) would have followed Jaehaerys to the throne.  However Jaehaerys decided against this and named his second son Baelon Targaryen as his heir.  Rhaenys Targaryen would thereafter be known as ""The Queen who never was"".  The issue of who would follow Jaehaerys did not end there after as the old king outlived his second son, Baelon as well.  And upon Baelon's death in 101AL a great council of the lords of Westeros was summoned to name the heir to Jaehaerys I.  Rhaenys, was once again in the mix, along with her cousin Viserys, Rhanerya Targaryen, daughter of Viserys, Laenor Velaryon (Husband of Rhanerya).. among others.  Each claimant with support with one noble house or the other, and many detractors.  It was in the end decided that the grandson of King Jaehaerys I, Viserys, son of Jaehaerys' second son and named heir Baelon would assume the throne upon the Old King's death, which ultimately happened 2 years later in 103AL..

-**The King and his Daughter**

After the death of his grandfather, the Old King Jaehaerys I, Viserys I Targaryen would assume the throne.  He was fortunate, and inherited as well as ruled in the long lasting peace left by his grandfather.  However his reign is marred by the consequences of his death in 129AL.  King Viserys I was unable to have a male heir last past infancy with his first marriage to an unnamed woman of House Arryn, however he was very fond and close to his daughter of that marriage, that being Rhanerya Targayen.  This closeness led him to name, and raise Rhanerya as his heir.

However after the death of his first wife, King Viserys I did remarry, to Alicent Hightower, and through this second marriage did have multiple sons, most notably the his eldest Aegon Targaryen.  Yet despite having sons that lived past infancy, King Viserys still wished his daughter to inherit the throne when he died, and left instructions as such in his will.  King Viserys I's eventual death did come in 129AL while at home in Kings Landing, while his heir remained at her seat in Dragonstone.  The resulting consequences of the Kings death were immediately felt, and would lead to one of the biggest and first major conflict that the Targaryen dynasty would face, one that would severely thin out the number of Targayens, and their dragons....but that's for next time. 

I hope you have enjoyed reading, I hope to get the next one of these out around Wednsday.. until then, thanks for your time.. ",7,64,False,self,,,,,

*potential apologies*

Hey there guys! I'm currently studying and have been given a project to design a brand of wine for one of my projects. We have quite a lot of creative freedom at my university so I've decided to design a wine from the GOT universe primarily because I'm a big fan of the books and series and secondly because personally I don't find wine very interesting, so it seems appropriate to bring it into a spectrum that I'm passionate about.

As you'll all surely be aware of, alcohol plays a rather symbolic role in George's universe and comes in a wide range of forms. From Myrish Fire Wine to the esteemed Arbor Gold, wine is used to pledge allegiances, make threats and is utilised as a tool to establish wealth and geographical location.

With this project I have the potential to design an existing wine from the GOT universe or implement my own into the current or future plot. I have a couple ideas and would really enjoy hearing what other people think and would like to see in terms of anything from potential wine theories and backstories, characters involved, labeling to bottle shapes, wine ingredients and flavour! Is it poisonous? Will it be used to kill a main character? Anything you might be interested in adding, I'd be happy to hear. I have a couple of notions about what I might do -one that is a little far fetched and involving Brynden Tully- and I'd be love to open those up to discussion too if this gets any intention.

If there's any interest I could post the final outcomes of my work and list you guys in my research and tell you guys how it all goes, so long as I'm brave enough to post my final product haha.

Cheers guys!",12,16,False,self,,,,,

Hey guys

So I'm trying to start a game on reddit based off of the War of the Five Kings. I spent the last two days writing rules and drawing maps and was wondering if anybody would be interested. **There is a subreddit for this at /r/asoiafgame**

The game will happen on a subreddit and will be very reminiscent of those old forum based strategy games which used to happen more. Players would take control of a house and put in orders which will be processed, with each turn probably taking about two to three days.

The game rules are a mod off GMT style card/map based board games (especially [Here I Stand](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17392/here-i-stand)), but with simpler rules and mechanisms so it scales up more.

I've currently made half a map and have written about three pages of game stats, but thought I'd ask if there's even any interest before I spend more of my precious few leisurely hours...

[Here's a preview of the map so far](http://i.imgur.com/8S9mHy0.jpg)

(For a bit of background I have run online forum games etc that have gone for nearly a year before. Never with a mod of this ruleset though.)

And just for a bit of an FAQ:

**Yes, I have played the GoT Board Game.** I in fact own it. This is not what I'm going for. I find that game too limiting and in some ways, complex.

**No this is not a videogame.** It's most like a play by mail strategy game.

**Time commitment** At minimum only about an hour every four days (that's how long a phase will take) for most players, but easily more if you want to commit more.

Any comments, questions, expressions of interest etc. welcome",21,120,False,self,,,,,

The storyline of Griff/[ADWD](#b ""Jon Connington"") and Young Griff/[ADWD](#b ""Prince Aegon"") during Tyrion's arc takes awhile before anything really interesting happens.  How much of hanging out on the boat do you see them translating into the show?  Personally I see the cyvasse scene and the attack of Grey Men/Tyrion overboard as the best suited for the screen before the true identity reveal.  Really, you could fit about all of it into 1-2 episodes.


Being that AFFC and ADWD are seemingly being melded together for the show, do you think they drop the revelation plot twist early in Season 5 or wait until Season 6?


Also, as far as casting: my choice for Griff would far and away be [Brendan Gleeson](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130613024813/villains/images/d/df/Raynald.jpg) (Kingdom of Heaven, Into the Storm).  Gleeson is an awesome actor who showed in KoH he has Action/Fantasy chops and fits the English/Irish mold the producers tend to favor.  As far as Young Griff, I am kind of impartial as long as he he has the charisma that the character will need to secure the trust of the Golden Company and later the Storm Lords.",10,3,False,self,,,,,

It's been quite a while since i last came in contact with the world of ice and fire, so when rewatching the series i noticed  a scene in S01E05 where Varys warns Ned. 
But later down the storyline we learn that he is still true to house Targaryen, since he planed the return of Daenerys for quite a while (if i'm not mistaken he's a friend of Illyrio Mopatis and planed lots of stuff with him). He also wants Cersei/The Lannisters to fail their reign (He wants Cersei to be the ruler/hand and not Karvan, because he fears that Karvan would be a reasonable ruler). So if Varys wants the Seven Kingdoms to fall, why does the support Ned who obviously only has the good of the realm in mind.

In season one, Catelyn takes him hostage and puts him on trial, as i'm sure we all remember, but after those episodes, the whole plot is dropped! They don't even question little finger about the knife! Even though Tyrion was freed, it was because of trial by combat, and Catelyn was never even fully convinced it wasn't him, so why shouldn't Sansa have one scene where she goes:

- Note on Spoiler Scope:  Okay, we are in some actual spoiler territory that extends beyond the ""general backstory"" that would dictate a ""no spoilers"" scope, as in this installment I wish to cover some of the events that were established in the recently released novella ""The Princess and the Queen"" .  And while I will attempt to be as vague as possible to the actual events of the books, there will undoubtedly be some spoilers regarding character names and deaths, as well as the fate of the dragons and some of the battles that took place during the ""dance of the dragons"".   That being said, I will not delve into any main series spoilers  during this post and the comments should reflect that.  With that out of the way, let's begin...

**-  The Family and their dragons at the death of King Viserys I**

Before I begin proper and to give context to this post I need to give the reader some idea of who's who at the time of King Viserys death in 129AL.  I will divide these by the two political parties that had developed just before the King's death, the Blacks and the Greens (more on this in a bit), as well as a bit on the history of the Targaryen dragons that I had been purposely skipping in my previous posts

- The Blacks (names of their dragons are in parenthesis) 

Rhaneyra Targaryen (Syrax), daughter of King Viserys, heir to the Iron Throne, and one of the principal claimants during the ""Dance of the Dragons"" 

Her Children by her first husband Laenor Velaryon (Seasmoke, later ridden by Addam Velaryon, bastard of Driftmark), Jaceaerys (Vermax)/Lucerys (Arrax)/ and Joffrey Valaryon (Tyraxes). And her sons from her second marriage to uncle Daemon Targaryen (Caraxes): Aegon (Stormcloud) and Viserys. 

Rhaneys, aka The Queen who never was (Meleys).  And The Daughter of Daemon Targaryen from another marriage, Baela Targaryen (Moondancer), and her twin sister Rhaena Targaryen.
 
The Blacks also had a handful of unaffiliated (riderless) dragons.  Vermathor and Silverwing.  

- The Greens

Aegon Targaryen (Sunfyre), Son of King Viserys, and the other principal claimant during the Dance.  

His Children, Twins Jaehaerys, and Jaehaera (Morghul, and Shyrkos), and Maelor Targaryen.  

Aegon's younger brothers Aemond (Vhagar), and Daeron (Tessarion).  

Queen Alicent Hightower, second wife of King Viserys, and mother to Aegon

- A bit of Dragonlore:  During the reigns of the previous kings the dragons flourished as much as the family.  Seemingly having no age limit the dragons grew as much as they could until death in battle.  The eldest and fiercest of the dragons at the time of the Dance was Vhagar, a dragon that had come with Aegon the Conqueror to Westeros was immense and not dampened by his age.   As noted above most of the Targaryen dragons were bonded to their rider, usually a member of the family, and will not take other riders.  This is not always the case however, as some dragons will take another rider after the death of a previous rider (see Addam Velaryon above).  And a dragon rider does not exactly have to be a Targaryen as we will see in a bit, there are current riderless dragons that have use in war and will need a rider.  There are several eggs mentioned in the story, mostly belonging to the youngest sons of Aegon and Rhanerya that remain unhatched.  As well as three egges mentioned belonging to Rhaena, also known as Rhaena of Pentos who survived the Dance with her eggs.  The Family was numerous as their dragons, neither would be after the Dance...

**-A black and green rivalry**

One of the biggest steps leading to the Dance of the Dragons, is the political rivalry between King Viserys I's daughter and heir Rhanerya, and that of her stepmother and second wive of King Viserys Alicent Hightower.  At a tourney in 111AL to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the the King and Queen, tourney champions for princess Rhanerya were successful in unseating all of that of the Queens.  While the queen had always resented King Viserys' heir, this tourney was of special note to history.  Princess Rhanerya had worn a dress of Targaryen Black and Red, while Queen Alicent wore one of Green..  This forever cemented the political parties revolving around the two women.  Supporters of Queen Alicent's (and later during the war her Son Aegon) were known as ""The Greens"" and supporters of Rhanerya's ""The Blacks"" 

So when King Viserys I did die in 129AL, it was unfortunate that Queen Rhanerya was away in Dragonstone (giving birth that ultimately failed), as well as her supporters.  Upon learning the death of the King, Queen Alicent summoned a small council and hid the death of the King from public knowledge.  The Queen gathered her supporters and learned (partially from records of the Great Council of 101) who would be likely to support the cause of Rhanerya should the realm go to war.  The Small council also led by the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole killed and/or imprisoned any detractors that would support the princess and crowned King Viserys eldest son, Aegon, King of Westeros.  This action would forever earn Criston Cole the moniker of ""The Kingmaker"".  Events moved fast and while the Greens secured power and the Throne and began making alliances, word of this ""treason"" reached Dragonstone and the Blacks began making their plans as well.. and thus began the Targaryen civil War known as ""The Dance of the Dragons.

**- The Dying of the Dragons**

The War had begun and the two opposing sides had begun securing their alliances.  Both parties sent envoys to the lords of Westeros to sure up their numbers. The Greens landed the Lannisters and their bannermen, while the Blacks gained most of the nobility in the Riverlands as well as the North.  However first blood came in the war when both parties attempted to secure the Stormlands and it's lord of Baratheon.  It was there that prince Lucerys Velayron met with King Aegon's brother Aemond and battled on their dragons above Storms End, killing Rhanerya's son.  In retaliation the husband of Rhanerya arranged the murder of King Aegon's heir Jaehaerys, an act that drove the King's wife Halaena insane.  

The war was brutal and both sides faced losses, King Aegon and his dragon Sunfyre were severely wounded doing battle with Rhaenys (The Queen who never was) and her dragon Meleys. Rhaenys and Meleys were killed, but Aegon was hurt so that he had to leave command of his armies to his brother and hand Aemond.  Prince Jacaerys was killed in a massive naval battleIn a decisive victory, Queen Rhanerya did manage to take Kings Landing, but allowed the injured King Aegon to escape.  There to sure up the numbers of dragonriders, Various Targaryen bastards (known as Dragonseeds) were trained to ride the various unaffiliated dragons.  Her stay in Kings Landing was not happy and was short lived, as the war raged outside, the droves of people in Kings Landing were growing tired of death and their formerly loved princess now queen.  Until one night the crowds were incensed and decided to riot, this night ended with death and destruction of 5 of the Black's dragons when the mob destroyed the dragonpit in Kings Landing, as well as resulting in the death of Rhanerya's youngest son from her first marriage prince Joffrey who fell to his death in an attempt to ride his mother's dragon. The Blacks untimely abandoned Kings Landing.  In a last slap in the face a few of the dragonseeds, turned face and switched sides to the Greens, and even declared themselves temporarily kings. 

Woe was on the side of the Greens as well.  Both of the King's brothers, and their dragons died in separate battles.  And massive support from the North helped the blacks win a decisive battle at the God's Eye in an event known as the ""fishfeed"" Later ser Criston Cole met his end when ambushed in the Riverlands.  It was a war of casualties on both sides that saw the vast majority of the Targaryen dragons, and the Targaryens themselves dead. 

With both sides having suffered major losses, Rhanerya Targaryen fled back to Dragonstone, only to be surprised to find her half brother waiting for her. Still suffering from his injuries, he had quietly made his way and taken the castle after escaping Kings Landing. Rhanerya's party was taken captive or killed, it was then that Rhanerya was brought before a dying Sunfyre, and fed to the dragon.  This was witness by Rhanerya's own son and now her oldest living heir Aegon.  Aegon had won and returned to Kings Landing, it seemed after so much loss the Dance was over..

**- Aegon III ascends**

It is unclear to readers how the proceeding events lead to the crowning of King Aegon III, son of Rhanerya Targaryen.  We do know that after the death of Rhanerya that Aegon II decided to take his nephew captive instead of killing him.  The Blacks did not end the war and continued war efforts in Aegon (Rhanerya's son) name after her death.  We also know that King Aegon II died of his injuries shortly after the death of his half-sister.  It is presumed Aegon III was crowned at this time, and officially ended the civil war known as ""The Dance of the Dragons"".   King Aegon II however did have a living son, Maelor Targaryen, why this particular individual was not crowned after Aegon II died is unknown, and not told of in GRRM's ""The Princess and The Queen""

Aegon III was indeed crowned and ruled Westeros for the next 26 years following the Dance.  His rule was peaceful and known for successfully reuniting and rebuilding the realm following the massive civil war.  His reign is marred however by the death of the last of the Targaryen dragons.  Very few dragons had survived the Dance, and what were born after that were stunted and sickly, most likely due to the lack of care King Aegon III gave for them; after seeing your mother being fed to one of the beasts can hardly improve your disposition for the creatures.  Some even say that Aegon III had a direct hand in the dragons extinction, this is likely untrue however as he did try to procure and hatch some of the remaining dragon eggs to no avail.  It is also likely that the Maesters of Oldtown had a hand in their extinction.

However marred by the end of the Dragons, King Aegon III, ""The Dragonsbane"" ruled, and once again house Targaryen flourished and repopulated under his banner.  His sons and eventually his younger brother would all follow him to the throne, but that's where we will pick up in our next installment.. I hope you have enjoyed reading, and until next time, take care... ",9,57,False,self,,,,,

But now that I finally have more time on my hands, I decided to read the book (for the first time).  And oh.my.goodness.  Here I thought I was doing so well understanding what's been going on in the show, but the book is so much more in depth! And there were some small tidbits of information but still significant that I completely overlooked (ie. that Lord Renley is the King's bro).

I'm re-watching the show from the beginning in parallel to my readings.  It's like watching a completely new show; I love it!

My family finally decided to give Game of Thrones a chance, and it has fallen on me to show them their first episode.  I've been telling them all to get on it for years, so I'm not sure what changed, but I really want to pick the perfect episode for them.  Something that plays up the political intrigue of the show, and preferably one without any gratuitous sex scenes.  Do any of you have any specific episodes that you use for first-time viewers?  Or if you have favorite episodes, what is it that makes it your favorite, and would it appeal to a new viewer?

EDIT: I went with the end of episode 7 and all of episode 8. I think that was the right decision.  I know, the opinion was pretty unanimously that they need to start form the begining, but trust me, this was the perfect episode to start with.  You skip the rapey Dany/Drogo scenes, you get the Walkers, the Badass-to-Vegetable transition of Drogo, the decline of Ned, the rise of Rob, and all the other main characters give a great synopsis of their own story.  Then, episode 9 starts out with Varys explaining the whole political situation to Ned, so they get it all summarized nice and neat.  I HIGHLY recommend starting people out with this episode if you need a quick hook for a reluctant audience.  ",11,0,False,self,,,,,

King's Landing hosts Tyrion and Sansa's wedding. Cersei intimidates Margaery in the Sept of Baelor, and Joffrey walks the bride down the aisle. At the wedding feast Tyrion gets drunk and causes a scene. In their bedroom, Tyrion tells Sansa they will not consummate their marriage until she wants to. The Hound reveals to Arya that they are heading for the Twins to ransom her to her brother. Stannis releases Davos. Melisandre and Gendry arrive at Dragonstone, where she seduces him and extracts blood from him with three leeches. Stannis casts them into the fire naming three usurpers. Daenerys finds out Yunkai employed a mercenary company called the ""Second Sons"". One of the lieutenants, Daario Naharis, kills the other leaders and pledges his and the company's loyalty to Daenerys. Sam and Gilly are attacked by a White Walker, whom Sam destroys with the help of the dragonglass dagger.|

He didn't seem equipped for a climb, and Sam only knew about the other passageway because he read about it in a book. On top of that, he admits that he should have gone back to warn his brothers at the wall, so we know he didn't stop there. On that note, how was he even caught? We just see the stark men come up on all sides of him, but how did he know he was a deserter? Would it have killed him to say ""Nope, not from the watch at all. Just taking' a stroll."" Even if they were alerted by the watch, how did  the Watchers on the Wall know that he wasn't just killed by the white walkers?

It made for a few humorous scenes and gave Tyrion and Bronn something to do before all the weddings got going, but was there a larger point?

One of Tyrion's most famous quotes in the books is coming up this season. After Jaime busts him out of the black cells, the brothers have an argument that ends with Tyrion confirming Jaime's fears about his sister: ""She's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack, and probably Moon Boy for all I know."" 

It's a great line, one that haunts Jaime going forward. The problem here is that two of those three characters don't exist in the show. Tyrion knows about Lancel and Cersei, but Moon Boy makes only a brief cameo in season 2 during the Blackwater battle, and there's no indication any of the Kettleblacks have been cast. 

Could this be where Podrick comes in? Might the line change to ""She's been fucking Lancel and probably Podrick for all I know""? It would be an easy change that would both be appropriately mocking (though admittedly a pudgy squire with a talent between the sheets is a step up from a fool) and also make sense for Tyrion to deliver. 

What do you think? Would this tweak to the line work for you?",11,13,False,self,,,,,

I'll be setting aside how she actually arrives in Westeros because that is a debate in itself as to if Victarion and Daenerys would be able to collaborate or not.

In my opinion the result of a invasion by Daenerys as of early Winds of Winter would be a war between Daenerys's army and Aegon who now has not only the Golden Company but new Dornish allies who would be motivated to fight Daenerys to avenge Quentyn Martell.

Why would Daenerys fight Aegon first over the remaining Tyrell/Lannister forces? Because I think Aegon would strike back first. Aegon doesn't care about his aunt, he made that clear in ADWD. After taking Storm's End and possibly more places in the time it took Daenerys to arrive I don't think Aegon would allow his aunt to come and pull the rug from under him, he would fight back.

How would he fight a war against Daenerys with dragons? I think his Dornish allies would attempt to repeat history. Dorne, for those who don't know was never taken by Aegon the Conqueror. The Dornish never met a Targeryen army in the field, they used guerrilla warfare with hit and run attacks slipping back into the desert. Even Aegon's dragons could not find them. Daeron I Targaryen managed to conquer Dorne temporarily, losing ten thousand men in the war but in only a fortnight there was an uprising in which Daeron lost fifty thousand men and his own life. It was only through marriage alliance Dorne joined the seven kingdoms.

It is plausible Daenerys could become entangled in a war in Dorne she is unable to win. The key to her victories in Essos were multiple siege battles in quick succession. Her own elite unsullied forces supplemented by mercenaries were easily able to defeat the outnumbered slave armies. I don't think she would be able to sustain a prolonged invasion with long marches in a inhospitable environment with an opponent who won't fight conventionally. If she doesn't die in the war she would have to bend the knee to Aegon and recognize him as the real Targeryen heir.

966,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-3-12,2014,3,12,17,207s39,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers All] What will be cut from Season 5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/207s39/spoilers_all_what_will_be_cut_from_season_5/,dannyfsantos,1394613971,"I've been thinking about how season 5 will shape up now that we have some clues as to what's in season 4 from the trailers. We know that the show-runners are looking at 8 seasons to wrap up the series which leaves 4 seasons for 4 books. However, ASoS is not as long as ADwD and that book was split in two and the final two books are threatening to be as long as ADwD so there will be even more truncating of stories in the upcoming seasons.

With that in mind, I think most of AFfC and ADwD can take place in season 5. We'll start with where I think the storylines will end this season:

**The Wall**
We know that the battle of the wall will show up in episode 9 of season 4 so I wouldn't be surprised that if in episode 10, Jon Snow is promoted as the new Nightwatch Lord Commander. I think this episode will be a lot like Blackwater and take up the whole episode.

**Arya and the Hound**
I really expect this story to be expanded on. They'll probably travel together for the better part of the season before Arya makes her way to Saltpans. It's possible they could change this to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea so they can recycle that for Sam-- two ports for the price of one! I'll take a stab in the dark and say that she boards the ship in episode 8 and we'll see her enter the house of white and black in episode 10.

**Brienne**
This is one of the stories I think is going to get bumped up considerably. I suspect that the last scene of season 4 will be her and Podrick meeting Lady Stoneheart.

**In the East**
Another story that will be bumped up is Dany's story in Meereen. There's already two thematic stories at play I can see next season, one is the love triangle (square, really) and the price of being a ruler. I'm pretty sure her story will end with her marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq to quell the uprising. Her banishment of Ser Jorah I think will happen before she gets married-- I'll pick that up in a bit. Ser Barristan I suspect will start training knights in Meereen in season 4.

**Bran**
This is the trickiest story to gauge since there's so little left for him to do from the books. I think we're going to see him finally meet the 3-eyed crow at the end of the season after fighting wights, finding coldhands and finally a child of the forrest who brings them to Bloodraven. I don't think we'll see anything from Bran plugging inton weirwood.net.

**Sansa and the Eyrie**
I think we're all betting on the Purple Wedding happening in episode 2. With that in mind I'll hedge my bet that this storyline will end with watching Lysa fly.

**Tyrion and King's Landing**
Most of the Lannister storyline will be from ASoS and I doubt we'll see very much from the latter 2 books. I think in episode 8 we'll see Tyrion kill Tywin and then have him in Pentos by episode 10 from ADwD. The plotline I expect to move up is Faux-Arya being sent to marry Ramsay after the Lannisters lose Sansa. The biggest change I suspect will be that after Jorah's banishment from Dany, he would have taken a ship back to Pentos and to his employers Varys and Illyrio, partnering Tyrion up with Jorah much earlier.

**The Islands, Davos and Theon**
Yara gets captured by Stannis on her search for Theon. Theon himself goes to Moat Cailin with Ramsay and will end up at Winterfell by the end of the season. One of the weirder ideas I suspect won't happen-- but I'll write it out here anyway-- is that Balon doesn't die this season. Davos' storyline from ADwD is bumped up here having him travel from Eastwatch to Salladhor Saan and finally to White Harbor where he's taken captive.

Once you go through each storyline for season 4 after watching the trailers, you can't help but notice there's probably going to be a lot of books 4 and 5 this season. There's still an obscene amount of story left in AFfC and ADwD but there's going to be huge chunks of story cut out. Here's what I think they're going to go with the next season.

**Dorne**
Quentyn's story is cut, wholesale. The rest of what happens in Dorne will probably play out right up to sending the sand snakes and his daughter on their way.

**Bran and Sansa**
Honestly, there's not a lot for these two to do at this point so I would hazard a guess that they may go further and bring in some material from TWoW.

**King's Landing**
The Cersei vs. Margaery storyline will be in full effect by now. There's no reason we won't see her drive her reign into the ground. I expect this story to end with her in prison, writing a message to Jaime.

**The Riverlands**
Even though I suspect Brienne of meeting LS at the end of season 4, I can't help but think that a lot of the story that happens in AFfC will be shuffled around to this season-- she'll just be looking for someone other than the Stark sisters... Speaking of which, I think Jaime accepting the surrender at Raventree will also be cut and there will only be the one at Riverrun which is where he once again meets Brienne.

**The Iron Islands**
The kingsmoot is going to have to be cut. The elder surviving brother, Euron, shows up and claims the throne and sends Victarion to Meereen and we get Victarion's story as that cuts a lot of the iron islands story down.

**The Wall**
Jon's story right up to stabby, stabby.

**Davos**
I think some of the storyline intended for Davos from TWoW will come into play here.

**Braavos**
We get into Arya's training and she crosses paths with Samwell. I don't think we'll see Oldtown but we'll probably see Sam finally book passage there and probably book passage for Gilly and son to Horn Hill.

**Winterfell**
Ramsay marries faux-Arya, Jon sends Mance to save her and he eventually recruits Theon. Meanwhile Stannis takes the long way down to Winterfell picking up some allies in the mountains and gets stuck in the snow and cutting out Deepwood Motte from the story.

**Tyrion, Jorah and Dany**
We already have Jorah on board with Tyrion but he's just waiting for the perfect moment to kidnap Tyrion. Tyrion of course finds out who Young Griff actually is and makes a suggestion to attack Westeros just before he's kidnapped by Jorah who plans on bringing him to Dany. We probably won't see Aegon's attack and it will just be reported in King's Landing. While season 4 would deal with what is happening inside Meereen, season 5 would pick up the Yunkai and Astapor seeking their revenge and having the battle of Meereen from TWoW take place here.

I think that can fit in a single season... even if just barely!",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Weight is good, the metal does have some heft to it, so it really feels as heavy as it looks. It is a little too shiny, but I'm sure it will look better after it gets scuffed up a bit. Aesthetically it is pretty good.

It won't fall out, but I find it a little unnerving that if I get bumped somewhere, it may fall out. Also this is a complaint I will make to the designers, the metal that houses the device is about a millimetre too wide, I require a quite a bit of force to connect it to the ports on my computer, and a hub I have. I've also tried connecting it to a friends computer and it has the same problem. maybe after a bit of use, the metal will wear down and it will go in easier, but until then, I gotta by mindful of how I put it in.",4,14,False,self,,,,,

A Season 3 spoiler tag is clearly spoilerific for the entirety of Season 3, and should only be looked at by people who are ready for Season 4. So why the sudden change in scope definition just because the new season is coming out? What is the difference between a Season 3 spoiler tag and a Season 4 spoiler tag at this very moment? Nothing?

* Big fan of GoT
* Always admired people who make can make trailers
* Needed to try it for myself
* Downloaded a 30 day trial  (premiere pro)
* Logged in today to see this :(  http://i.imgur.com/t1P9q1l.jpg
* The almost done version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k56Ch2nRQMQ

**Just long enough**:

I have always wanted to try my hand at making a trailer, and with the fourth season on it's way I finally had the motivation to do so.  

In order to correctly manage your expectations,  I should note that prior to challenging myself to this task, I haven't had any experience video editing, so please do not be expecting perfection :D

**My last 30 days:**

**Days 1-10**
 hahah that was brutal.  Almost bailed.  Spent so much time backtracking,  deleting and starting over, wrong resolutions, overwriting files,  ahh it was a mess.  

**Days 10-15**
Started making some progress... in terms of video length,  not in terms of any sort of quality.  There were scenes upon scenes that showed a whole lot of nothing, just so the voiceover could finish what he was saying.  Then I would watch it and be like THAT WAS AWESOME lol

**Days 15-25**
Finally started to get some momentum, finally started to be able to create something the way I saw it in my head.  This was a fantastic feeling.  The problem here was, the more I learned,  the more I had to erase the sections before them so I could apply what I just figured out.  This was frustrating.

My question is this - the ending of ADWD left a lot of room for speculation, most of all (for me at least) who will the riders of the other two dragons be?

Let's recap, shall we? At the end of ADWD, Dany is supposedly taken by a Dothraki khalasar. Quentyn got cooked and Aegon took Storm's end. These are the three who we were lead to expect would ride the dragons. Unfortunately, this may not be the case now.

I'd like to see what everyone else thinks. Who do you think will be among the first people to ride dragons over Westeros in hundreds of years?

Thoros's prayers were great and the watchers chanting guilty made the scene even nore dramatic. Arya seems like she's gonna be a pyscopath now. stealing knives and killing people.

Academics wanted!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/20cvte/s3all_show_spoilers_a_survey_for_show/,lambomrclago,1394751743,"Hi all,

This is a post I'm writing to help with my Thesis paper I'm doing as a College senior. If you have the time, please read on and respond to any/all questions I pose. In short, I am a communications/media studies major writing their thesis about Game of Thrones; particularly HBO, their branding strategy, the fan community (specifically how the two interact and converge) and how ""new media"" is changing this relationship. ""New Media"" nowadays involves new media technologies such as wireless internet and devices, social media, and many others. I'm analyzing how and why HBO is branding themselves in today's media environment, how fans interact with Game of Thrones, each other, and HBO, and how the advent of social media and the technologically driven era we are living in is effecting this fan/creator relationship. Below are several questions I have for this community, as it is a large online community in which fans interact about Game of Thrones. The questions with a * after them are particularly important.

How did you hear about Game of Thrones?

Do you watch the show, read the books, or both?

Why do you visit this subreddit? (/r/gameofthrones)*

Why do you think fan communities like this one exist?*

Do you watch other HBO shows?

On a scale of casual to fanatic, where do you fall?

What do you think the role of online communities/social media is in not only Game of Thrones and HBO, but in television?*

What do you think is the role of fans/fandom is in today's media landscape?*

How do you see this relationship evolving/changing in the future?*



I realize there are quite a few questions to answer, but any and all answers are incredibly helpful. I may follow up this post with further questions/responses to what I receive.

Thank you ahead of time for the help.

One of the finest chapters of the series so far in my opinion.

The knight stood, turned, raised a hand. Two of his men stepped to the towering doors and pushed them open, and Cersei walked through them into the open air, blinking at the sunlight like a mole roused from its burrow. A gusty wind was blowing, and it set the bottom of her robe snapping and flapping at her legs. The morning air was thick with the old familiar stinks of King's Landing. She breathed in the scents of sour wine, bread baking, rotting fish and nightsoil, smoke and sweat and horse piss. No flower had ever smelled so sweet. Huddled in her robe, Cersei paused atop the marble steps as the Warrior's Sons formed up around her. It came to her suddenly that she had stood in this very spot before, on the day Lord Eddard Stark had lost his head. That was not supposed to happen. Joff was supposed to spare his life and send him to the Wall. Stark'
s eldest son would have followed him as Lord of Winterfell, but Sansa would have stayed at court, a hostage. Varys and Littlefinger had worked out the terms, and Ned Stark had swallowed his precious honor and confessed his treason to save his daughter's empty little head. I would have made Sansa a good marriage. A Lannister marriage. Not Joff, of course, but Lancel might have suited, or one of his younger brothers. Petyr Baelish had offered to wed the girl himself, she recalled, but of course that was impossible; he was much too lowborn. If Joff had only done as he was told, Winterfell would never have gone to war, and Father would have dealt with Robert' s brothers.
Instead Joff had commanded that Stark's head be struck off, and Lord Slynt and Ser Ilyn Payne had hastened to obey. It was just there, the queen recalled, gazing at the spot. Janos Slynt had lifted Ned Stark's head by the hair as his life's blood flowed down the steps, and after that there was no turning back.
The memories seemed so distant. Joffrey was dead, and all Stark's sons as well. Even her father had perished. And here she stood on the steps of the Great Sept again, only this time it was her the mob was staring at, not Eddard Stark.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I noticed that there didnt seem to be very many podcasts solely concerned with the HBO show and friendly to Unsullied so I'd like to change that.

I am interested in starting a podcast dealing solely with Game of Thrones, ThronesCast, and having the first episode air right after the season premiere in April.

The podcast will be weekly and during the on-season will discuss the most recent episode, speculate on the next episode, ask and answer fan questions and the like. During the off-season we will discuss news for the next seasons, rewatch previous seasons and talk about how our opinion of them has changed with the benefit of hindsight and anything related to HBO's show.

There will be no book spoilers on the podcast and will be very friendly towards those who are reading the books along with the show or are only show-watchers.

Interested in being a cohost? PM me or reply here!

We are firmly out of the aftermath of the Dance of the Dragons, and ready to cover the next generation of the rulers of Westeros, so let's not waste any time and get right to it...

NOTE ON SPOILER SCOPE:  Back into the no-spoiler territory, all of what's here is established back-history established within the novels..so fear no spoilers here..

**- The Great and short rule of the Young Dragon**

Upon the death of King Aegon III in 157AL, it was once again time to crown the 8th King of Westeros, Aegon's son, Daeron.  Daeron I was the youngest Targareyn monarch to sit the Iron Throne at the age of only 14 years old, and would hold the record of the youngest King of Westeros until the rise of [Game of Thrones/Season 1](#b ""Joffrey Baratheon took the throne at age 12"") .  His age earned him the nickname of ""The Young Dragon"".  He is most known for being the Targaryen that finally conquered the southernmost region of Westeros...Dorne, succeeding where his ancestor Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters had failed, all of this at only the age of 17   The young king had written a book of his conquest titled, ""The Conquest of Dorne"".  And while history remembers Daeron I kindly for his bravery and leadership in the conquest, the fact that Dorne regained and retained independence for another half century tells another story.  While the Young Dragon successfully conquered the region, he met many of the same quarrels his ancestor had met, the guerrilla warfare style of the Dornishmen.  It is said that in the taking of Dorne that over ten-thousand men were lost, and that in the short time Dorne was held, another fifty thousand had also perished.  Dorne did not stomach the realm or the young dragon for very long, and after only a fortnight had expelled the young dragons armies, this resulted in the death of both the steward Daeron had left in charge, as well as the death of King Daeron I himself, at age 17.  Daeron had no children, and as far as the books have told us, had no queen.  The throne passed to his younger brother Baelor Targaryen in 161AL.

**-Blessed or Befuddled?**

Of all the Targaryen Kings that have ruled Westeros, no one is more divisive of opinion than King Baelor I Targaryen, he is both loved and ridiculed by the histories of the time of the main series.  Being a highly religious man, and a Septon he reveled in piety and ruled accordingly.  He was humble and charitable to the small folk of the realm.  He sought favor and brought peace between his realm and Dorne.  While Baelor is not credited with formally bringing Dorne into the realm, as that would not officially happen for a few more decades, Baelor did arrange the marriage of his second cousin Daeron (who would later rule as Daeron II) with that of a Martell princess, laying the foundational bricks into Dorne's union into the realm.  Baelor is also remembered for rescuing his first cousin, the legendary member of the Kingsguard Aemon ""The Dragonknight"", from a pit full of vipers.  Baelor is said to have survived numerous bites from the vipers but his favor from the gods kept him alive, though historical accounts dispute this story, as it could be considered a metaphor for Baelor's relationship in making amends with Dorne.  Baelor is also credited for bringing the faith into King's Landing.  For centuries the hub for the Faith of the Seven had been located in Oldtown, in the southern part of the reach. (Oldtown is also where the Citadel, the central hub for the Order of the Maesters is located). But Baelor commissioned the building of the Great Sept atop Vesenya's Hill in King's Landing, formally re-locating the Faith to the Capital, as well as raising a lowborn stonemason, whom he believed to be the Smith in human form to High Septon..these are the deeds Baelor is loved for..

On the other hand his zealotry and piety cause many of those schooled in Westerosi history to look upon Baelor I less fondly.  Among those noble deeds, Baelor, like any man had carnal urges, but instead of acting upon those urges, Baelor locked his three sisters, including his own Queen Daena Targaryen (who history would remember for something else to be discussed in a later installment) in a part of the Red Keep called ""The Maidenvault""  as to not tempt him.  Baelor was also successful in banishing one of the most profitable (and taxable) professions in King's Landing, when he shut down every brothel and sent away the prostitutes of the city.  He (unsuccessfully) attempted to replace the messenger ravens of the realm with doves.  Baelor was loved for his piety, but his piety also made his rule suffer, and he had very little to do with the day to day management of the realm which fell upon as a task of Baelor's hand of the king, and uncle Visery's Targaryen, who had also served as hand under Daeron I.  Baelor's adherence to the faith also cost him his life, as his numerous bouts of fasting had long diminished the king, eventually leading to his death in 171AL.  It was these numerous, as some say blunders that lead to the less favorable recounts of Baelor Targaryen, one of which in the main series is Tyrion Lannister, who has been quoted saying that a more appropriate title for Baelor should have been ""The Befuddled"" rather than ""The Blessed""....  Sadly, due to his unwillingness to consummate his marriage to his queen (or with anyone else) Baelor Targaryen died childless, as his brother did, thus the throne went to the uncle of Baelor I Targaryen, Viserys II.

**-The one year rule of Viserys II Targaryen**

If Baelor I is one of the most loved Kings that has ever ruled in Westeros, his uncle Viserys II is one of the least loved, or remembered.  His reign lasted only a year before his death in 172AL.  His reign was marred by rumors that he had poisoned his predecessor and nephew Baelor I to gain the Iron Throne, instead Baelor dying of over-fasting, rumors that persisted until his death.  Nothing notable can be said of the reign of Viserys II other than it's short length.  However there are also some that do look at Viserys II, such as (once again) Tyrion Lanniser, with a bit more favor than is given credit to him.  Viserys II was very young when his mother Rhanerya was killed at the end of the Dance of the Dragons, and grew up during the reign of his brother Aegon III.  However he was essentially the ruler and acting King of Westeros while his nephews Daeron I and Baelor I were distracted with making war and prayer, though very few give Viserys credit for keeping the realm in order and at peace with itself during this time.  

Viserys II may not be kindly remembered among Westerosi historians, but his reign did not tarnish the name of Targaryen as his son would.  A son that would lead Westeros into it's second major conflict.. as upon Viserys II's death, thus began the reign of Aegon IV Targaryen...

And that's where I leave you for today, join me next time when you will see just how ""Unworthy"" Aegon IV was, and read of the realm once again in the midst of a large rebellion.....

Bored, so I came up with this.

Tywin Lannister/Lex Luthor:  Both are not really evil, you can say they are ""bad"".  Cold, calculating, and precise.  These men both use the best weapon of all; their mind.  Some say they have an ego.  Both want their names to be feared and respected.  Will do anything to be on top.  Their legacy is all that matters.

Arya Stark/Batman:  Both come from rich and powerful families.  Both had their parents killed in horrific ways at a young age.  Both swear to get vengeance.  They will use the shadows to do so.

Faceless Men/Thanos:  Both worship death.  Everything can and will die.  Death is the only true answer to life.

Jon Snow/Dick Grayson:  Sons to a powerful father, although they are not true sons to that father.  Young and spry, eager to prove themselves as a hero.  They both take on a new area to start their lives(Jon takes the black, and Dick leaves to Bludhaven)

Ramsay Snow/The Joker:  Sick, sadistic, and all sorts of crazy.  They love to play with their prey before killing them.  They want to savor every moment.  Nothing gives them more of a jolly then inflicting pain onto others.

Littlefinger/Loki:  While they are not the most physically impressive warriors, they use their schemes and tricks to get their way.  They both feel like they have been slighted their whole life.  They both believe they should be the one true king of Westeros/Asgard.

Young Robert Baratheon/Young Thor:  They wield a mighty hammer that can crush a foe in one swing.  Their strength is unrivaled.  Great warriors, who only know how to fight.  Everything else bores them.  War is what they know and crave.  Both have defeated a great reptile (The Dragon Rhaegar/The Midgard Serpent).

Tyrion Lannister/Tony Stark:  Both can feel the shadow of their father looming over them.  They do not allow their physical limits to stop.  Like their father, their minds are their weapons.  They both love to drink.

Brienne/Wonder Woman:  Big women who are warriors at heart.  It confuses men as to how a woman can be such a capable fighter.  Honorable, kind, but not soft.  They believe in doing the right thing, and if that means plunging their sword into your heart, then so be it.

The Hound/Wolverine:  Great warriors.  Not afraid to kill.  They see through hypocrisy of being a knight/hero.  They both want to kill their older brother.  They are the best at what they do, and what they do isn't very nice.

Bronn/Deathstroke:  Sell sword/gun for hire.  You get your money's worth when you employ their services.  They are morally grey characters.  Not only are their really good fighters, they are smart as well.  They have a tactical mindset which is perfect for their line of work.  It is not a question of what they will do, it is a question of how much money you have to pay them.

Theon Greyjoy/Jason Todd:  Taken in by a surrogate father who is powerful(Eddard/Batman).  They feel like they do not belong to anyone.  They want to prove themselves.  They want to be loved and accepted, but in truth have no idea how to obtain what they want.  Foolish to a fault.

Eddard Stark/Supernan:  Both have loyal dogs(dire wolves/Krypto).  Both are powerful men.  Honorable to a fault.  So much conflict could be ended if they could make that ""hard"" decision.

That is all I got, feel free to add more.

I never read any of the books, and I do enjoy the series greatly, definitely ranking up in my top enjoyed series, however I seem to becoming distant from it. Of course I will watch every episode of S4 as it comes out, but I'll explain a bit more why.

The GOT series so far was very interesting, with dragons, magic, amazing effects/sets/costumes/characters/environment and was really well made overall (did I leave out tits and killing?). However, the story up to this point was primarily Starks vs Lannisters, with the Starks being the 'good guys' or the side the audience is meant to side with (because of their kindness, loyalty, honesty) who are wronged by the Lanisters (power hungry, liars, literally backstabbers, schemers, sadists). Yes there are other subplots, but those are mostly uninvolved, with the exception of Danny being a slave who was wronged, and her ascension to a great Queen/Princess who frees slaves and does right (and fuck yeah! dragons) which is meant to garner the readers sympathies.

However the show was primarily a revenge motivation, both in show and by the viewers, of Starks getting revenge on the Lannisters for the killing of Nedd, and wanting to see something bad happen to house Lannister as 'judgement'. However the show goes on, and on without revenge, and the Lannisters win and win, culminating with the Red Wedding, and the Starks lose and lose.

So I sit here at the end of Season 3, and while I enjoy just the richness of the show, the amazing production, Danny's dragons, the Nights Watch and wildlings plots, many of the more interesting characters are getting killed off, leaving more and more uninteresting characters/plots being focused on, such as the Greyjoys (Iron Island subplot), Stannis/Melisandre, and of course almost everything at Kings Landing (although the Lannisters are evil I must admit them to be quite interesting/entertaining at times).  So at this point in the show, they are killing off almost everything and to me, the interesting plots still remaining are dwindling to Arry/""The Hound,"" lesser so Jon Snow/Knights Watch and Danny and the dragons.

Also, the show seems to like to switch back and forth very often whether a character is good or not, such as Jaime Lannister breaking down emotionally and later saving Brienne, Tywin being shown as having respectful qualities like standing up against Joffery and treating Arry well, and even the other way around. Like Robb Stark breaking his marriage promise and Catelyn causing her own problems.

So far, the only retribution the viewer has against the Lannisters is Jaime's severed hand, while the Starks have lost their homecastle Winterfell and had it burned down, lost Nedd, Rob and his pregnant wife, Catelyn, 3 of their wolves, their son Brann crippled by Jaime, Sansa is a hostage and plaything of Joffery, and Arry who is forced to fend for her life on the run.

So , sitting here at the end of Season 3, I have to ask how far can this go? I mentioned I didn't read the books, so everything I am getting from the series, but it seems like a simplistic formula of just creating characters you like and side with, who are mostly good and and been wronged, and having them tortured and wrong again, and again, and I think they have taken it too far ... since here at the end of Season 3, 3 years and 30 episodes into the series, you have the Starks, who never asked for power or for any of this, to be almost annihiliated, while the Lannisters are simply as good as even minus a hand. It gets disinteresting as a viewer to watch a story where the only bad guys win, despite all interesting effects, costumes, marvelous set design, production, everything that is done perfectly as far as making the show, however the basic plot boiled down is still ""lets see how much torture the Starks can endure while we still maintain viewership and people don't get sick of our show."" So you can dress up a turd in a suit but its still a turd.

I am aware of the possibility and very likely hood that the Lannisters will eventually get what is coming to them, and possibly it may be done at the hand of one of the (few) remaining Stark children, but I just find the plot is getting a bit confused and lost, and the Season 3 finale Ep 10(which essentially was the Red Wedding, although that was in Ep 9), is not even noteworthy, and is just the threat of the White Walkers coming back which they have been talking about for the whole series now, and some further inner bickerings of the Lannisters, who Tyrion is the only semidecent person because he refuses to rape Sansa and isn't as cruel as his fellow kin.

tl;dr Watching Starks be tortured, and hope for Justice worked for Season 1 &amp; 2, but its becoming boring in Season 3 and the plot needs to progress further without this same pattern continuing.  Creating new interesting replacement plots/characters at this point mid way into the story may be more difficult than the writers expect as they continue to ""shock"" viewers by killing off main characters.

The past few weeks I've seen a lot of discussions regarding TWOW release date, how season 4 of the show is going to play out, the issues regarding the show catching up to the books, etc. Forget all of that. What I've been wanting to discuss recently is this - *What other tales from the world of Westeros would you like to see adapted for the screen?*

To me it is really incredible to think about just how much material we have from this world that could be adapted into some really cool spin-off shows, or some really amazing films. Personally, I'd love to see some Dunk &amp; Egg films. I've read the first two (reading #3 now) and I think in the hands of the right director they could be a big hit. Another thing I would really love to see would be a film about the Blackfyre Rebellion. Everything leading up to it, and everything that happened as a result. Plus, I've always felt like seeing the [Battle of the Redgrass Field](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Redgrass_Field) in a movie would be as epic (if not more so) as the Battle of the Last Alliance at the beginning of Lord of the Rings...

So, I'd love to hear some thoughts on this because I'm sure I'm not the only one who's ever thought about this. Does anybody have a particular event/time period from ASOIAF they'd love to see adapted?

Sam and Gilly arrive at the Wall. During a thunderstorm, Bran enters Hodor's mind to calm him down. Nearby, Jon refuses to kill an innocent man, so Tormund orders him killed. Bran uses his warg ability to save Jon, and Jon kills Orell then escapes, leaving a furious Ygritte behind. Osha, Rickon and his direwolf depart for the Last Hearth, while Bran and his remaining company plan to head beyond the Wall. Daenerys sends Jorah, Daario and Grey Worm to infiltrate Yunkai and open the city gate for her army. Robb arrives at the Twins and apologizes to Walder Frey, who feigns acceptance. Edmure marries Roslin Frey, but during the wedding feast, Walder Frey's men murder Catelyn, Talisa and most of the Stark bannermen, while Roose Bolton kills Robb. Arya also arrives at the Twins and witnesses a part of the massacre, but the Hound knocks her unconscious and carries her to safety.|

Yes, we all love:

* the one-liners (""If the throne were made of cocks they would have never gotten Renly off of it"")
* the monologues (""Chaos is a ladduh"")
* the magic (dragons, the multiplicity of that Qarth warlock, and many instances)
* the fight scenes (Bronn vs. Ser Vardis)
* the *battle* scenes (wildfire at BWB)         
* the scheming *reveals*  (Littlefinger holding Valyrian steel to Ned's neck upon turning the gold cloaks on Ned)
* and the [sexposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexposition) and overall nudity.

But what are your ***subtle, non-verbal*** moments?  I ask for ""subtle"" moments, because otherwise we'd get all sorts of submissions of warfare or sex.

Here are a few of mine:

* **Tywin's pause upon walking into the king's hallway.**  Joffrey summons Tywin to his throne for small council news.  From behind, two kingsguards escort Tywin.  They take about 5-6 steps, then Tywin simply stops. He doesn't say a word, doesn't back at the men, nor does he even turn his head.  **After the pause, he resumes walking, and the guards stay put.** Like a BOSS.  He commands knights without saying a word.

* **Jaime getting the feel of his first blade in a year -- by tossing it back and forth between both hands a few times.**  This might be ***my favorite subtlety of the series.***  We all know that Jaime is a skilled swordsman, but other than his tussle with Ned, we haven't seen much.  What I like about this scene isn't even the fighting -- it's the very subtle moment of Jaime receiving his missing piece: a sword.  Like he says, he is that sword/hand.  Seeing him get it back was beautiful, watching him as he gets used to the grip, weight, and balance of the sword.  I felt like I was watching Jimi Hendrix tune a new guitar, Picasso feeling the bristles on a new brush with his fingers, or Beethoven just playing the middle C key to check the tuning, acoustics, and timbre of a new piano.  Again, it was merely flipping the sword handle to feel the cold steel, and that scene gave me chills the first time.

* **Tywin walking up the stairs of the Iron Throne**.  Joffrey complains about having to walk ""all the stairs"" to go up to the small council meetings in the Tower of the Hand.  Tywin shows ""the little shit"" that even at his advanced age, Tywin can do the very thing that the teenager is complaining about. Tywin then stands tall in front of Joffrey, towering over him.  Joffrey then recedes into his chair like two testicles going up back inside for cover.

* **Missandei's sneer at Kraznys right after Dany says to Kraznys, in Valyrian, ""Valyrian is my mother tongue.""**  Yes, it was cathartic to see Dany get her revenge at Kraznys for all the seemingly-veiled insults. However, the true, sweet justice and revenge belonged to Missandei against Kraznys for forcing Missandei to constantly change the sexist remarks and.

* **Shireen's and Davos' laugh together.**  Ok, not quite 100% non-verbal, but it's still non-speaking. Shireen: ""What are they going to do?  Lock us up in cells?"" after Davos warns her about the two of them conversing.  Their laugh was just pure child-like innocence.

* **Ser Jorah's look after Dany's inquiry into Daario's fate.**  Jorah showers Dany with flattery upon returning from eliciting a surrender from Yunkai: ""It was just as you said! [they surrendered].""  Jorah was out of breath, as if he ran back with the news.  Dany ignores Jorah, and instead realizes Daario isn't back yet and asks about him.  Jorah has the look of utter defeat, the look of a grown man just being told ""let's just be friends"" after he pours his heart open to a girl.

* **Loras' look after he philosophizes on brooch vs. pin = brooch.**  He's looking away from Sansa after he says that his pin is more of a brooch, but then says he guesses they're probably the same.  It's basically Loras doing an impression of George Constanza's back-and-forth shoulder shrug and sheepish smirk while listening to his own answering machine play back him singing ""Where....could I be?  Believe it or not, I'm not home.""  

* **Arya's [thousand-yard stare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand-yard_stare)** at the Frey campfire the day after the Red Wedding. One of the Frey soldiers is gloating about sewing the wolf's head on Robb's body.  Arya feigns bargaining for food or fire, and is only interested in killing. It is EXACTLY the look you would expect from an 11-year old girl who just heard that her mother and brother were murdered, that her brother's body was mutilated and decapitated, etc.  Just about all the vigor and innocence of a young girl had evaporated.

I have many more, but I don't want to (further) bore any of you guys.  

The series is filled with fascinating dialogue and hilarious quips, adrenaline-pumping action, non-stop scheming, and gratuitous sex.  **But these sorts of subtleties round out the show to make it elite TV.**

**TL;DR -- The show has plenty of fantastic subtle moments that don't involve any dialogue.  What are your favorites?**",67,47,False,self,,,,,

His reasoning was that Joff is just *too great* a villain.  Aside from Tyrion (and maybe the people in love with Emilia Clarke) Joffrey-hate is one of the top reasons people love the show (referring to ""casual"" viewers here).  Cersei isn't developed enough on the show yet to replace him as most-hated, and if anything his death will likely soften people's opinions about her (mother grieving over son etc).  So what if the show delays his death?  Maybe he almost dies at the wedding, but is still present throughout the trial until season's end or beyond, on his deathbed so not really affecting events beyond the fact that he didn't die.  Then the show slowly fades his influence out while raising Cersei hatred before actually killing him.

I'm not really presenting this as a theory per se, I really don't think it's going to happen (neither does the guy who suggested it), but it got me thinking about what major changes the show *could* get away with.  The show has enough power now to stand on its own, and all the recent ""show will beat the book to the end"" chatter could mean it's not a matter of *if* the show will deviate significantly from the books, but *when*.

It seems that, generally speaking, all minor houses owe allegiance to one of the houses that constituted the seven kingdoms. Stark/Winterfell, Lannister/Casterly Rock, Baratheon/Storm's End, Greyjoy/Pike, Martell/Sunspear, Tyrrell/Highgarden, and Arryn/The Aerie. However, there is another house that has a whole bunch of bannermen - The Tully's.

Is there some back story as to if the riverlands were part of one of the 7 kingdoms before and somehow got their own seat and bannermen?

Any explanation would be super. Thanks y'all.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Stannis seems like a weak, needy king who ask Melisandre to help him, anyone remember the infamous ''Rape of Stannis'' in S03E03 where Stannis almost beg Melisandre for more ''sons'', and Littlefinger is portrayed as creepy and way to obvious on the screen.

I understand that Littlefinger is a hard character to show on the screen since most of his work must be unknown to the viewers and since we have no POV of him. I also understand that Stannis had little to no information on what he did after the Battle of Blackwater Bay, since the only POV who follows him (Davos), is in a dungeon for at least half of ASOS. 

Gladly for all the Stannis and Littlefinger's fans, Season 4 should be their biggest season. Stannis will attack the wildling at the Wall with all his leadership and commitment. I hope that at this point, we will stop seeing the needy Stannis for an all revisited cold badass rightfull King of the Seven Kindoms. Also, I hope we will see a more shady and a more subtle negociator in Littlefinger. It's his big realease this season, where the viewers will finally understand his machiavelism and machinations. 

D&amp;D it's finally the time to make Littlefinger and Stannis shine, please make them as good as they were supposed to be. ",35,65,False,self,,,,,

I'm halfway through season 2 and the one that stands out the most to me is the way they handled Arya's deal with Jaqen H'ghar in Harrenhal. In the books she names Chiswyck and Weese, two relatively unimportant characters who are not in the show.

In Game of Thrones, however, she names the Tickler and Ser Amory Lorch. This bothers me for a couple reasons. One of my favorite moments in ASOS was when Arya stabs the everliving shit out of the Tickler when she and the Hound chance upon him and his buddies at an inn toward the end of the book. This is also a key moment in the development of her character's morals. Second, Ser Amory Lorch committed one of the most gruesome crimes in the series: he killed baby Rhaenys Targaryen by stabbing her a hundred times. It's kind of lame that he gets such an easy death when in the books he is fed to a bear.

Anyway, that's mine. I'd love to hear some of yours. Again, huge fan of the show.",54,22,False,self,,,,,

OK so with S4 about to start and with how much fun we all had (admit it!) seeing reactions to the Red Wedding, might there be any such plans for this season? In my eyes there really only seems to be one 'event episode' that would really warrant gearing up the cameras for (episode 2 for Jofferey's death). There are certainly some great scenes we are all looking forward to but this is undoubtedly going to be the most momentous &amp; unexpected of the entire season - especially considering how early it happens.

While it could seem a little ""been there done that"" cliche to do another 'reactions' setup, I actually don't think that's true in this case. Basically because these reactions are going to be *dramatically* different (re: excited and happy and celebratory) than pretty much any other event in the entire season. Here's how I expect the reactions to play out:

""Oh shit, wait, what's happening to Joffrey? Is he choking? WTF no way did someone poison him!?!?!?! Nope, don't believe it, someone will save him, no way he is going to die in *episode TWO*, ""the worst ones always live"" .... here comes his mom to save the day, bleh.... ""

""... wtf lol he still choking!!! DIE BITCH DIE!!! PLEASE DIE!!! OMG OMGOMG DID HE??? I dont believe. Something has to save that prick right? RIGHT!? BUT STILL NOT BREATHING! DIEEEE!!!!!!! HOLY SHIIIIIT HE IS DEAD! DING DONG THE JOFFREY IS DEAD!!!! NO WAY! FINALLYYY!!!!!!""

... pretty much that, a lot of that, and jumping around and cheering.

It seems like prime 'reaction video' material to me. ",69,70,False,self,,,,,

&gt;After being defeated at the Battle of the Green Fork, Lord Roose Bolton withdrew his forces back across the Green Fork while Lord Tywin Lannister camped at Harrenhal.However Robb Stark attacked the Westerlands, drawing Lord Tywin out of Harrenhal. He named Ser Amory Lorch as castellan and marched out, leaving as a garrison only a hundred men and the Brave Companions, an unsavory sellsword outfit from the eastern continent under the command of Vargo Hoat. Vargo Hoat returned to Harrenhal after one of his raids with at least one hundred captives, claiming to have beaten Lord Roose when he tried to cross a river. Arya Stark, seeing an opportunity, demanded that Jaqen H'ghar help her in freeing the northern prisoners. Under the guise of bringing the guards onion soup, Arya, Jaqen, Rorge and Biter, whose help Jaqen had enlisted, killed the guards watching the northern prisoners and set them free. Unknown to Ser Amory Lorch, a deal had been struck by Vargo Hoat and Lord Roose that Vargo was to turn over the castle. The Brave Companions turned on their former allies, killing many in their beds. Once the garrison was killed, Lord Roose marched on Harrenhal and Vargo Hoat turned the castle over to him. By taking Harrenhal from House Lannister, Lord Tywin was trapped between Lord Roose's force at Harrenhal and Ser Edmure Tully's at Riverrun, culminating in the next major battle of the War of the Five Kings, the Battle of the Fords. At Harrenhal, Ser Amory Lorch was killed by a large black bear in the bear pit as sport for the Brave Companions.

- What is happening in this scene with all of the bodies? http://youtu.be/38hnsgqf8O0?t=3m6s (Link will take you to the specific scene automatically). Who killed who? 

- Whose side is Locke/ Vargo Hoat on? Is he the leader of the Brave Companions in the show? Isn't he a vassal of Bolton's? Wouldn't Lord Tywin have know that? Why would Tywin leave him in charge of Harrenhal?

It's a treat. It moves fast. There is a lot crammed in, but it flows well. This is a brain dump, so I may be slightly out of order, but I'll do my best. I've only listed what I saw on screen, however the significance of certain scenes may be greater for those who have read the books or novellas and I expect discussion will go into further detail, so READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

At the start, we see Ice being melted down and used to forge two swords. I don't think the names Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail were specifically mentioned. Tywin gives one to Jaime (and tries to order him to quit the Kingsguard, but Jaime isn't having any of that). 

There's a scene with Jaime and Joffrey and the Kingsguard book. This scene made it obvious who the book readers were in the audience. Joffrey thumbs through it, noting Arthur Dayne's entry (and mentions the Sword of the Morning) and that there are four pages for Duncan the Tall, who he notes must have been a very impressive knight. He mocks Jaime for having so much blank space under his name.

Tyrion tries to help Sansa, but Sansa doesn't want any part of it. She goes off for some solitude in the godswood and is found by drunk Dontos the Fool. He gives her a piece of jewelry that he says belonged to his mother, with some pretty purplish stones.

Margaery and the Queen of Thorns are picking out jewelry for the wedding when they are approached by Brienne. It's a great moment, Brienne is bracing herself for abuse and instead gets a very complimentary reception from them. 

Tyrion goes back to his room and finds Shae waiting and very ready for him. He's not in the mood and she's not happy about it. She brings up diamonds and he starts putting it together that someone tried to get her to leave behind his back.

There's a scene with Jaime and Cersei. Qyburn is just leaving and she thanks him for some unnamed prescription that ended some unnamed symptoms. Jaime asks what that means but she won't tell. He also notices she's drinking a lot more. He starts coming on to her, but she has something in common with Tyrion in that she's not having any of that. She's pissed at Jaime for leaving her alone so long and doesn't take being captured and de-handed as a valid excuse.

Daenerys lines up her soldiers but Grey Worm and New Daario are missing. They're gambling. The bet itself is funny and how Daenerys deals with it is funnier. She starts off not taking any crap from New Daario but he offers her some advice and she warms up a bit. He's smooth, but not annoying so far.

The free folk get some reinforcements. Some very hungry, creepy reinforcements. Styr is... unsettling. They went with both scarification and cannibalism for the Thenns. There's an ""eating crow"" joke explicitly made.

Jon Snow warns the Night Watch of the impending attack. He explains Halfhand's death and his own oathbreaking. 

Arya and the Hound are on the road. This is my favorite part of the episode, they are golden together. Arya wants her own horse. There's an encounter at an inn with someone Arya has run into before, and he still has something she wants back. This part of the episode got not one, but two spontaneous cheers from the audience. It's a brutal fight and Arya gets her Needle back... then returns the favor.

Tyrion and Bronn go to meet the Martell contingent, but the prince isn't there and the other Martells give them the cold shoulder. Instead, Oberyn and his paramour are at the brothel, picking out a girl together. Oberyn also pulls the male attendent into the mix. It's all very sexy... until some jackass in the next room starts singing a damned song about rain. Oberyn barges in to deal with a couple of drunk Lannisters. He doesn't kill anyone, but what he does do establishes him immediately as a badass. Tyrion gets there just a tad too late to prevent all the damage, but takes Oberyn aside. We get the story of what happened to his sister Elia and that he has Gregor Clegane on notice for it. 

Daenerys' road trip comes to a halt when they get to a nasty road sign - a dead kid, pointing ahead, to mark each mile. 

That's all I can recall right now. I'll do my best to elaborate or answer any questions.

EDIT: added Styr info

In an article published by Entertainment Weekly [only last week](http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/03/11/game-of-thrones-7-seasons/), Benioff and Weiss confirm that they still intend for the series to last 7-8 seasons.

Meanwhile, you've got [this](http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/george-r-r-martin-interview?mbid=social_twitter) Vanity Fair interview with Martin, also published last week, where the author speculates that books four and five, once combined, could consist of three seasons alone.

All this despite the three having met up in the past year to discuss the big picture.  Obviously, the math doesn't add up here. Who's right? It seems to me that for the showrunners to pad as much as GRRM is supposing, they'd have to slow down the pace. On the other hand, they can't maintain their speed without outpacing the books and having to end the story on screen before the page (which may require inventing a show-specific ending).

If nothing else, this seems to indicate that Martin isn't all that abreast on what the showrunners' plans are, which seems odd since he tends to write the teleplay for an episode each year, and Season 5's scripts are probably largely written. Thoughts?",10,5,False,self,,,,,

The theory consists of Jon Snow being Lyanna Starks rape/love child with Rhaegar Targaryen while she was held captive during Robert Baratheons rebellion. There are a lot of details in the book that subtly hint at the fact that this could be possible 
1.) Rhagaer loved Lyana (presented her with flowers at a tournament instead of his wife Elia of Dorne) 
2.)Robert Baratheon HATES Rhagaer 
3.) Ned Stark has a promise kept with Lyanna, a promise that is very important to her and one that we can assume was made on her death bed.... Ned Stark would never break a promise, kinda like how he doesnt ever speak about Jon Snows mom....

So how would the GoT realm ever figure out the truth of Jon Snow when Ned Stark, Lyanna Stark, and Rhagaer Targaryen are all dead?

Bran

Brans story moves slowly in the show and in the books. Im only on the first book but my roomate agreed fully with my hypothesis so here I am. (He has read all five books.) Bran is on his way to try and kill the raven that has three eyes. Three eyes meaning Past, Present and Future. Brans dreams have been consistently interesting as his story goes on, he knew his dad was dead before it happened, and his powers have only been getting consistently sronger. My guess is that once Bran masters his powers or atleast controls/uses them more, he will have a dream or vision of the promise Lyanna Stark had given her brother Ned. Bran will then figure out the truth of his 'bastard' brother and be able prove it. If this prediction is true this will make Jon Snow not only a decently rightful heir to the Iron throne but also to North of Winterfell under the Stark name.
Jon Snow is a very important character.
TLDR; Bran will figure out Jon Snow is a true badass and heir of the throne and the north from his magical dream powers.",21,7,False,self,,,,,

I'm about half way through A Storm of Swords, and I guess I'm roughly caught up with the show.  My intention is to finish the books currently in print before catching up with S4 of the show, as I don't have HBO anyway.

Up to this point in the books I've been underwhelmed with the plot and actually enjoyed the story arc the shows have taken that differed from that in the books.  That said, I've really enjoyed ASOS overall, in comparison to the previous two volumes, and feel like the written story is really taking off.  I'm sure the show will continue down a different path than the books, but do any of you who have finished the books and have watched the show feel like the pace really picked up in ASOS?  I'm hoping that this isn't just a momentary thing, as I feel like the the second book dragged out a bit.  Just curious, not trying to blaspheme here!

On a side note, I feel like the show up to this point in the story has done a much better job building up the mysteriousness and epicness of the Others, while in the books, they're just kind of there and accepted, ie the Fist of the First Men encounter.",19,4,False,self,,,,,

The one which screams at me is why is Margaery taking the Moon Tea and who could she be sleeping with?

I believe she has been sleeping and plotting with the High Septon. Here is why:
 
In book 4 Osney reports to Cersei all her activity and nothing stands out except that she goes to the sept often to pray. 

The two share the view that the common folk are an avenue to power. Margaery first arrives to Kings landing bringing food and cares for orphans of the war to gain the people's love. The High Septon sold all the faith's treasures to buy food to fed the masses; at this time most the food to King's Landing is coming from High Garden. 

The High Septon's power is limited; winter is coming and most his followers will most likely die; there are two armies waiting to rescue Margaery if need be. 

I think the outcome will be that Tommen &amp; Mycella will be proven to be a product of incest removing their claim to the throne. With Stannis either dead or just via his heresy will also no longer have a claim as far as King's Landing is concerned. This leaves the throne empty and it will fall to the Faith to select the new King/Queen (Margaery). 

Thanks to Varys, Casterly Rock will most likely now fall to Lancel who has devoted himself to the Faith and I am sure the gold will surely follow. Until Daenerys and Tyrion land at Lannisport anyway. 

So yup that's pretty much my thought a lil coup with the help of the church. But pretty cool if true cause then you got to wonder who's the real player of this game? Margaery&gt;Queen of Thorns&gt;Lil Finger? ",20,23,False,self,,,,,

So I have some questions regarding Varys' character which I would like to have some answers to before season 4 starts, so I can keep up with the story. I'm not a book reader (yet) and English is not my first language, so that might explain my confusion a bit perhaps...

I think I understand the other characters and where they are coming from, but Varys confuses me. Basically, I don't understand whose side Varys is on and why he does what he does. I don't understand his motives.

My understanding is that he must be one of the characters who knows the most and has the most spies, since he always seems aware of the latest news, schemes and gossips. I know he has said something along the lines of that words hold more power than swords, so that helps explain this thirst of knowledge. What I don't understand is why he involves himself so much and how he picks sides or choses who to help. He says that he ""serves the realm"", but I don't know if he's telling the truth or not. Does he really do what he does to keep the realm at peace, or does he have an ulterior motive? Does he enjoy doing what he does or does he do those things because he feels he has to?

I don't remember all scenes that involved Varys, but for example, I don't really get why he visited Ned Stark so often after he was imprisoned in season 1. Was he trying to help Ned, was he trying to make him confess in order to secure Joffrey's position as king (peace of the realm idea) or was there another reason? 

Why did he keep Shae's presence in King's Landing a secret to the other Lannisters after he found out? To get Tyrion to trust him? Because he dislikes the other Lannisters?

A war between Danaerys and Euron (if he truly does capture one of the three dragons, we're in for a treat).

I do wish to note as this episode will be covering the Blackfyre Rebellion, that most of the information on the rebellion does come from the ""Dunk and Egg"" novellas...but once again I'll stress that it is still lore and D&amp;amp;E won't be spoiled for you..

So without further delay, lets begin..

**-Aegon The Unworthy and the Great Bastards**

As King Viserys II died the stage was set for his eldest son, Aegon to take the throne and become the fourth Targaryen monarch of that name to sit the Iron Throne. Not much is known of his early years of rule other than Aegon IV was considered strong and handsome; great things were expected of his rule.  It would be the later years of his reign that would sully his name.

As the waning years his reign, the King became a corrupt, and obese king, who was the polar opposite of his cousin Baelor I who ruled before him who wildly indulged his carnal urges.  Aegon IV kept many mistresses and had as many bastards.  He had no great love for and neglected his Queen, his sister-wife Naerys Targaryen only fathering two true-born children to her, his eldest son Daeron Targaryen, and a daughter, Daenerys Targaryen.  His Bastards were more noteworthy; more specifically his four ""great bastards"" (fathered on women of nobility):  Daemon (later known as Daemon Blackfyre), Aegor ""Bittersteel"" Rivers, Brynden ""Bloodraven"" Rivers, and Shiera Seastar.  It is also important to mention that King Aegon IV favored Daemon over his trueborn son, Daeron.  Daemon, who's mother was Daena Targaryen and former Queen of Baelor I, was charming handsome and was the makings of a fine warrior reminiscent of Aegon the conqueror, in contrast to Daeron who favored books and scholarly endeavors.

The seeds of Rebellion were planted when King Aegon both formally  acknowledged Daemon as his son after an exceptional outing at a tourney, but presented his bastard son with the ancestral Targaryen sword ""Blackfyre"", instead of passing it on to his trueborn son Daeron.  There were also whispers and rumors regarding the legitimacy of the King's son Daeron, whispers that reached king Aegon IV himself.  As I mentioned, Aegon had no special love for and was exceptionally disloyal to his queen.  His queen Naerys was not happy in the marriage and had loved the King's (and her's as well) younger brother, Aemon ""The Dragonknight"", considered the finest and most nobel swordsman to have ever lived and to have graced the Kingsguard.  Rumors of an affair between Ser Aemon and queen Naerys were not all that were mentioned, the high possibility that the King's heir, Daeron was in truth the son of Aemon the Dragonknight had also reached the ears of the King.  So it came to pass when the King was dying and upon his deathbead he earned his moniker ""The Unworthy"" when he legitimized all his bastards, formally placing them in the line of succession to the Iron Throne.  It is implied that king Aegon IV wished Daemon to succeed him and not Daeron. 


**-The Red Dragon, and the Black Dragon**

King Daeron I ascended to the Throne in 184 AL after the death of his father, amid the rumors of legitimacy surrounding him, and the controversy of his father legitimizing his half-brothers.  However war would not break out for a decade.  Though a series of mounting tensions led to it's outbreak.  As rumors of Daeron II's illegitimacy grew, councilors urged Daemon to make a claim for the Throne.  Among those councilors was his half-brother and chief supporter Aegor Rivers, also known as ""Bittersteel"", but not wishing open rebellion Daemon withheld.  Daemon also formed his own house during this time, though legitimized by his father, Daemon did not take the name Targaryen, but  formed the house of ""Blackfyre"" named for the ancestral sword that was bestowed upon him.  Daemon took the custom of bastards inversing the colors of their houses as their banners and took for his sigil that of a black dragon on a field of red.  Thus earning him his moniker ""The Black Dragon"" 

Daeron was busy during this time as well, his marriage into house Martell, set by his Uncle King Baelor I was fruitful, and he had already fathered a few sons by this point, his eldest prince Baelor ""Breakspear"" was growing into a fine warrior and loved by the realm.  It was at this point that King Daeron II formally brought the region of Dorne into the realm when he married away his sister Daenerys to House Martell, completed what his ancestors Aegon the conqueror, and King Daeron I failed to do.  It was this move however that lit the match that sparked the Blackfyre rebellion.  

Daemon Blackfyre and Daenerys Targaryen had loved eachother, and amid the growing tensions between him and his half brother the King, had resisted conflict and going to war.  It was the action of marrying off Daenerys to house Martell that proved the final push, along with the urging of Daemon's councilors, and the resentment of his bastard birth, into him declaring war against the realm and to make his claim for the Iron Throne, thus beginning the Blackfyre Rebellion.  

Nothing much is said of the Blackfyre rebellion, nor it's battles in the text of the main series or ""Dunk and Egg"" other than it lasted about a year, and once again divided the realm into a massive and bloody civil war.  Of the loyalists a chief lieutenant was Brynden Rivers, aka ""Bloodraven"" who sided with his half-brother King Daeron, who also served as the King's ""Master of Whisperers"" at the time, mainly in opposition to the support Daemon Blackfyre was receiving from Bittersteel whom Bloodraven utterly hated and had a fierce rivalry with. 

What is known is how the rebellion ended, in a battle known as the ""Battle of the Redgrass Field).  Many events unfolded here.  Bloodraven fought Bittersteel in single combat, costing Bloodraven an eye. Daemon Blackfyre was said to be unstoppable, cutting down every challenger that crossed his path.  Prince Baelor Breakspear and his younger brother Maekar Targaryen were vastly effective against the rebel host working in perfect harmony pinning the rebels between Dornish troops led by Baelor, and the loyalist forces led by Maekar, the song ""The Hammer and The Anvil"" chronicles their deeds. It was when Bloodraven spotted the personal banner of Daemon Blackfyre that he commanded his men to launch a volley of arrows at him. Daemon was fighting along side his twin sons Aegon and Aemon Blackfyre when Bloodraven's arrows came, Aegon was slain there and then, and Daemon refusing to leave his son took multiple arrows as well killing him.  For the briefest of moments Daemon's son Aemon took up the sword Blackfyre and made to fight until he was also slain.  

Thus ended the first Blackfyre rebellion.  Though the war was lost, House Blackfyre was not.  Daemon had other sons that remained to him, too young to fight they were kept across the narrow sea.  The Half-Brother of the King, Aegor ""Bittersteel"" Rivers survived the battle and was successful in regaining the sword Blackfyre and fled across the Narrow Sea, he went onto form the sellsword company ""The Golden Company"" who persists to this day in the main series... Their cry still echoes the memory of it's founder, ""Beneath the gold, the bitter steel"".   It would not be the last time House Blackfyre would trouble House Targaryen, but that's for another time...

-------------------------------------

So I leave you there.... at the end of the rebellion, and in the midst of the reign of King Daeron II Targyen.  Join me next time when we will finish up with his reign and go another era of peace for the realm, and leading to the crowning of an ""unlikely"" monarch... Until then, thanks for reading.

Although I admit that the lack of discipline/regiments of the Khalasar is not perfect, we must recall that GRRM found inspiration for it from the Mongols.
People devalue the Mongols by saying that they had no siege capabilities and would be crushed if met by European knights.


Here's the truth: The Mongols had more than capable siege machinery and took many a castle from Russia to modern day Czech republic. [Furthermore, the introduction of the bubonic plague was thanks to the mongol siege of Kaffa](http://contagions.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/plague-at-the-siege-of-caffa-1346/)


In addition, [the Mongols came into contact, and defeated European knights on many occasions.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Legnica) Please do not devalue these incidences by saying that the Kievan Rus had peasant fighters etc. because the Mongols encountered well-equipped knights deep into Germany as well.

First off, sorry if this type of post isn't allowed. I work at a station in LA on a weekend show from 4-6. Both the host and I are big GoT fans and in anticipation of the upcoming S4 premiere, we're having a quiz show!

I will be asking the questions and listeners will call in and answer. 

There will be six questions, two easy, two medium, two hard. I have a list in my head, but if anyone in this sub can think of fun questions for show watchers, let me know in the comments below!
  
   

So far I have:  
  
**[Easy]** Name all of Catelyn and Ned Stark's children (It's a trick!)  
**[Easy]** Why did Stannis Baratheon cut off Davos Seaworth's fingers?  
**[Medium]** How many brothers did Daenerys Targaryen have? Name them.   
**[Medium]** Who was Hand of The King before Ned Stark?  
**[Hard]** Who was Jorah Mormonts father?   
**[Hard]** Name the 5 kings involved in The War of the Five Kings  
  
  
  


The questions are meant to be fun for casual show watchers. I'm sure there are more fun questions out there, so feel free to post!

If I get an ""OK"" from the mods, I'll post where you can listen live.

House Frey receives the Seat of Riverrun, Roose Bolton is appointed the new ""Warden of the North"", resulting in a victory of House Lannister. Arya and the Hound witness Frey soldiers parade Robbs decapitated corpse around the keep with the head of Robbs wolf. While coming upon four Frey men discussing the murder, Arya slips off and kills one of the soldiers and is then assisted by the Hound who dispatches the others. Meanwhile House Greyjoy begins a new military campaign to recapture Theon who is being held at Dreadfort by Lord Bolton's bastard son Ramsay. In Kings Landing, Tywin chastises Tyrion for not having impregnated Sansa and reiterates the importance of family. Jaime and Brienne arrive in the capital, and Jaime immediately goes to see Cersei. In the North, after meeting with Sam, Maester Aemon sends out ravens to alert the whole of Westeros about the arrival of the White Walkers. Sam gives Bran and his entourage information about a passage to North of the wall. Ygritte shoots three arrows and hits Jon when she catches up to him. Jon manages to escape and seeks help at Castle Black. At Dragonstone, Davos allows Gendry to escape and Stannis receives the raven flown message about the White Walkers. And across the Narrow Sea, freed slaves of Yunkai receive Daenerys as their ""mhysa"", meaning ""mother"" in Ghiscari.|

I had an immediate theory, since when john asked ""why ?"" their answer was ""for the Night's Watch"" or something like that. I think they did it because Jon's acts were against his oath (he clearly took a part by helping Stannis and by letting the wildlings going south of the Wall).

But I saw another theory, saying that it would be Cersei trying to kill him as she already planned earlier. I don't really like this theory though.

So what do you think ? Why did his bro's do that ? Do you think he will actually die ?

If he dies, I think he will very probably be resurrected by Melisandre, since he seems to be important for her. Would you be okay with that ? That's a twist that we begin to see a lot lately, so I'm not sure if I want to see it happening again !",25,14,False,self,,,,,

2488,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-3-26,2014,3,26,1,21bxi7,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers]What the future holds for Gendry,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/21bxi7/all_spoilerswhat_the_future_holds_for_gendry/,DogeSaint-Germain,1395763872,"Gendry is likely the one character whose story has the most deviated in the show as compared to the book so he is also the one whose storyline could go anywhere. He is supposed to be with the BwB, unbetrayed and content for now but, instead, the last we saw of him, he was drifting from Dragonstone towards an unspecified location, probably sick of people and aware of his father's identity. Now, the show has two options with Gendry: come full circle or move forward.


The first and most logical solution for his plot would be to met Brienne and Pod on their way to the Riverlands and join them. There are not many good reasons you can think of for Gendry to return towards those god forsaken lands but one that springs to mind is that he has realized Arya is everything he has and all else is betrayal. However, since Brienne falls in the hands of the BwB, his arc would seem a bit pointless and random. Something that could happen is that Brienne and Pod are captured but he is not, which could help for their eventual arc. It still seems a bit easy and viewers would probably wonder about it. He could also part ways from Brienne and Pod at the end of this season to go south to Storm's End for whatever reason like finding his roots or just a rumour of a job (confer infra) before they are caught.


Another option would be for Gendry to fall into Varys' hand who, we know, is aware of his existence and could want to sent him east with Tyrion, either through sympathy because he knows Gendry won't survive in Westeros or to teach his protege a lesson about ruthlessness (since, at term, they would want Aegon to kill Myrcella and Tommen). He would then become a smith in the Golden Company (maybe he would identify with these rejects of the Westerosi society) and befriend Aegon, becoming our familiar eyes in that storyline after Tyrion leaves them. We could see through him Storm's end being taken and, maybe, a conflict arising with JonCon wanting Aegon to kill Robert's blood once they learn about it. They could arrive at the same place in the other scenario I mentionned above in which case Gendry would be used for dramatic effect (ie him being in Storm's End when it's taken and Aegon entering the doors under Stannis's banner before taking off his helmet) before getting involved in the Aegon storyline. 

This may be far-fetched but pretty logical to me since the show will want to avoid having too many storylines and will want to attach familiar characters to new storylines. If Aegon just leaves Tyrion after 5 episodes (5.1 to 5.5 for example), you would want to give viewers something to stay attached to this storyline which, I think, is something that was lacking from the books as can be seen by most people's disinterest in what happens to them. It also helps in characterizing JonCon's regrets and thirst for blood which readers can see through his inner monologue. ",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I googled around and found some very nice sources like grammar explanations and a vocabulary list, but it's hard for me to find a beginning. I couldn't find a tutorial, lessons or something like that.

From best...

1) Jaime/Brienne
I love their banter, Jaime's (temporary?) redemption, Brienne's courage and honor...the acting is immaculate.

2) Daenerys
What an incredible acceleration from the repetitive and middling season 2 plotline.

3) King's Landing plotline (Lannisters, Tyrells, Sansa, etc...)
I adore Tyrion, Cersei, and Tywin as characters. Such a perfectly messed up family. 

4) Robb/Catelyn
Tragedy!

5) Arya/Gendry/Brotherhood
That moment where she finally murders someone was so satisfying. She's the best child actress on the show in my opinion. That flaming sword fight with Sandor was incredible too.

6) Jon Snow/Ygrette/Wildlings
Sort of a botched romance, and I've always thought the Snow character was a little whiny, but there are some great moments in here.

To worse...

7) Davos/Stannis/Melisandre

8) Sam/Other men of the night's watch
Sam is so boring, but sort of sympathetic too I guess.

9) Bran and others
This storyline moves so slow, and I'm really sick of Bran's dreams. 

To worst...

10) Theon

Obnoxious, pointless, nauseating torture-porn that doesn't accomplish anything and could have been done in three scenes. Or not done at all.

This theory regards the *scenes*^1 after Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie been captured by a Lannister garrison, stationed at Harrenhal.**   

**As a refresher**:

* Arya is traveling with Night's Watch recruits, including three recruits so dangerous that they're put in a cage to protect the rest of the group from them.  One of them is Jaqen H'Ghar, a mysteriously dangerous man.

* During an attack by the gold cloaks, a fire breaks out and is about to kill the three in the cage.  Arya saves them by handing them an axe.  Jaqen takes note of Arya saving their lives.

* The group is then taken to Harrenhal as ***prisoners*** of the Lannister garrison stationed there.  At Harrenhal, The Tickler commands a couple of men to torture and kill prisoners daily.

* Tywin Lannister finally arrives at Harrenhal, and he puts an end to the torturing, since it was wasting all the available labor.  Jaqen is made a soldier/guard, and Arya is Tywin's personal cup-bearer.

* During her time as cup-bearer, Arya is privy to Tywin and his council's discussions over warfare.  She also makes small-talk with Tywin, and they strike up a good rapport and relationship, especially considering who Tywin is and who he is to Arya (more explained below).

* Arya runs into Jaqen, and he tells her he owes her 3 kills, since she robbed the Red God of 3 lives.  All she has to do is provide 3 names.

* She names The Tickler first, who dies from an apparent accidental fall into the courtyard from the 2nd floor.  Next, Arya is caught stealing a military letter, and one of the councilmen is on his way to tell Tywin.  Arya begs Jaqen to kill him, and he reluctantly agrees, killing the man with a poisoned dart.   

* Tywin leaves Harrenhal.  Arya frantically tries to find Jaqen in order to name Tywin as the 3rd death wish, but Jaqen says it's impossible (Tywin is surrounded by guards now).

* Arya is angry at Jaqen, even though it was her fault for waiting so long.  She asks Jaqen to help her, Gendry, and Hot Pie with an escape, and threatens to name Jaqen to kill himself if he doesn't.  He reluctantly agrees.  He kills 4 or 5 guards, and they escape.

**TL;DR RECAP -- Arya could have any 3 people killed by Jaqen H'Ghar -- all she needs to do is provide him names.**

**^1 This is mostly regarding the TV show, rather than the books.  In the books, Arya is not cup-bearer for Tywin; rather, she's the cup-bearer for Roose Bolton**

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**POSSIBLE PLOT HOLE: ""Why didn't Arya use one of Jaqen H'ghar's three death wishes on Tywin?""**  

Not only (1) should she kill Tywin, but (2) she has it guaranteed by Jaqen.

* (1) **If Arya could kill anyone, it would be Tywin.**  He's the most powerful man in Westeros AND is **Robb's #1 enemy, and most dangerous one**.  Tywin's death would have **ended the war right then and there.**  As his cup-bearer, she heard and saw that the Lannisters were planning attacks and defenses against her own brother.  Sure, she wants revenge against Joffrey, Cersei, Ilyn Payne, The Hound..... but realistically, Tywin would be her #1 choice, due to proximity of Jaqen and his likelihood of success, her own proximity so that she can watch the death, and **the threat that Tywin poses on her family (the other 4 names -- Joffrey, Cersei, Payne, Hound -- literally didn't harm any Starks after that point (The Hound actually helped Sansa and Arya), while Tywin masterminded the Red Wedding after he left).**

* (2) It's a guaranteed kill by Jaqen.  Arya clearly knows that (1) Jaqen can kill just about any body, (2) Jaqen can kill anyone with minimal to no suspicion, (3) the more time she provides, the easier it is for Jaqen to kill the target.  Clearly, Jaqen could have killed Tywin if Arya had provided Jaqen enough notice.  He was even able to kill the 2nd guy with 1 minute's notice.  If she had named Joffrey or Cersei, at best it would have taken months, and at worst it wouldn't even happen.  Tywin would be simple, considering that Jaqen killed the 2nd guy who was walking up to Tywin's quarters alone; Jaqen could have easily killed Tywin.

Later on, when Arya talks to The Hound, she refers to Jaqen as a ""real killer"" who could kill The Hound ""with his little finger.""  So, she's clearly aware of Jaqen's power, even if she doesn't know how he does it.  

Unfortunately, Arya was asking Jaqen to kill someone who already left and was surrounded by guards on horseback, making it impossible.  She had DAYS to name Tywin.  **So, why didn't she?**

Gendry even points out how ridiculous it was (paraphrasing), **""Let me get this straight...you could have had Jaqen kill any 3 people, and you didn't use any of the three death wishes on Tywin Lannister?!  You could have just ended the war by having Tywin Lannister killed!""**

Arya just keeps saying ""shut up!"", and then she tries to reason with Gendry by saying, ""Jaqen got us out, right?""  Then, she just changes the subject to asking if they're lost. 

**TL;DR PLOT HOLE: There's no actual explanation for why she didn't name Tywin Lannister, Stark enemy #1.  She had a guaranteed kill and didn't use it.  Why?**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**THEORY: Arya was suffering from [Stockholm Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)**

In a nutshell, this syndrome **""is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with them.""  It is also construed as ""traumatic bonding"" between prisoner and captor.** 

[Here's an official FBI manual on Stockholm syndrome, which is cited in the Wiki article](http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/2007-pdfs/july07leb.pdf/at_download/file)

I'll save you the trouble and quote the key parts:

&gt; ""Research has suggested that hostages may exhibit the condition in situations that feature captors who **do not abuse the victim,** a long duration before resolution, **continued contact** between the perpetrator and hostage, and a **high level of emotion**.""

&gt; ""Individuals involved in situations resulting in Stockholm syndrome display three characteristics, although these do not always exist together:

* (1) Hostages have positive feelings for their captors.
* (2) Victims show fear, distrust, and anger toward the authorities.
* (3) Perpetrators display positive feelings toward captives as they begin to see them as human beings.""

&gt; ""They must become highly attuned to the pleasure and displeasure reactions of their captors.  As a result, victims seem more concerned about the perpetrator's feelings than their own.  Hostages are encouraged to develop psychological characteristics pleasing to hostage takers, such as dependency; **lack of initiative; and an inability to act, decide, or think.**  Victims are overwhelmingly grateful to captors for giving them life and focus on their acts of kindness, rather than their brutality.""  

&gt; There are several requirements.  **The captive must see the perpetrator as showing some degree of kindness.  Kindness serves as the cornerstone of Stockholm syndrome**; the condition **will not develop unless the captor exhibits it in some form** toward the hostage. **If the captor is purely evil and abusive, the hostage will respond with hatred.**  But if the perpetrators show some kindness, victims will submerge the anger they feel in response to the terror and concentrate on the captors' ""good side"" to protect themselves.""

**Here is evidence of Arya's symptoms of Stockholm syndrome:**

* **First off, we should remember her captivity conditions prior to Tywin's Arrival.**  She was literally put in a sort of pigpen with other criminals, and it was open air and raining on her as she slept.  Not only that, but every single second she and everyone else lived in fear, since no one knew if that would be their last day, as The Tickler was torturing and killing people every day.  So, she goes from quite literally the worst captivity conditions to one where she's under a roof, by a fire, getting fed, and is guaranteed complete safety.  **That alone makes her feel like she just got ""rescued"" by Tywin.**

* She already impressed Tywin by pretending to be a boy in order to survive, and ***he compliments her on being smarter*** than his bannermen.  The compliment at worst makes her feel conflicted, and it might even make her feel more human.  Those are Tywin's first words to Arya -- a compliment.

* She starts off dutifully serving Tywin, without hesitation and with full cooperation.  This is just a first instinct to survive and not drawing attention to her feelings of murder.

* She unwittingly starts to try to impress Tywin with her education and knowledge, and he again compliments her.  This creates a sort of positive feedback loop where she somewhat unconsciously tries to impress Tywin and look for his approval, and he keeps giving it to her, and she keeps trying to impress him.

* Even when she slips up early on, she's safe.  She lies to him about which house she falls under, and he calls her out.  She's afraid at first, but he gives her a 2nd chance, and she feels safe.  Not only that, but she begins asking a question but realizes it's not her place -- but he allows it anyway.  At this point, she's feeling warmth, or at least some bonding.

* Arya and Tywin are striking up such an easy rapport that even after calling out her lie of being from the Riverlands, he tells her that he fully knows that she's a highborn girl pretending to be a commoner, and he is unexpectedly OK with it because he sees her as a smart girl just trying to survive.  Not only does he *not* punish her for lying to him, *he gives her advice* on how to further her deception (like saying ""m'lord"" like an illiterate low-born, rather than ""my lord,"" as high-born, educated children do).  **He gives her advice so that she can survive without him later on.**  Had a male tried to defraud Tywin, he likely would have been killed.  But Arya was not only spared, she was further helped by Tywin -- making her unconsciously bond with him more.

* He actually smiles and even laughs with Arya (like when she calls girly girls stupid), and we literally NEVER see Tywin laugh or even smile before or after this.  **He even says that she reminds him of his own daughter -- and she arguably subconsciously feels like he's a surrogate father.**  She converses with him in a somewhat cordial way, even though he's both the most powerful man in Westeros AND Robb's most dangerous enemy.  

* Tywin ends up liking Arya so much that he talks to her casually with ***small talk -- this is HUGELY exceptional for Tywin.*** We NEVER see Tywin talk to anyone else about anything unimportant.  Whether he's conversing with Lady Olenna (and extorting her to accept his daughter's marriage with her grandson), with his councilmen (about war tactics), with King Joffrey (regarding recent updates), or even his own children (telling them what to do, like getting married) -- Tywin ONLY talks with purpose, he doesn't do small talk.  Both times Tyrion and Cersei visited him while he was working, he was just sitting there writing and working silently, while his kids sigh to try to get his attention...and he gets annoyed and asks, ""What are you STILL doing here?""  **Tywin is literally treating Arya better than anyone else, including his own actual children.  This has to make Arya feel conflicted about killing a man she *thought* she knew as evil.**

* She brings him dinner, but he instead offers the hot meal to her, saying that she must be hungry.  **He's actually feeding her instead of himself.**  Arya wanted him dead, but she can't bring herself to attempt to kill him.  

* They further bond over the history of the Targaryens.  Again, Tywin doesn't do small talk, but here, **he's taking an active interest into Arya's knowledge and enthusiasm for the stories.**  He even grins and nods in approval.  Later on, at one point, he tells her that she's too smart for her own good, almost in a teasing but complimentary way.  Even when she talks back to him with a sarcastic question (""do you know many stone masons?""), all he says is ""easy girl, I enjoy you, but be careful.  You can finish eating in the kitchen and have whatever you want.""  Not only does he not punish or smack her, he offers her more food despite her insolence.  

* He enjoys the fact that she's not trying to be like other girls.  Tragically, earlier in the series, Ned was telling her about how she'd grow up like a proper lady and be some high lord's wife and raise kids, and she hated that notion; then, you have Tywin, who pretty much enjoys her ambition to be something other than a traditional girl.

* It doesn't help that Arya has been separated from her parents for months, and that her father is dead.  Tywin not only acts as a father figure, he flat out says that she reminds him of his own daughter.  **Arya unwittingly treats him like a surrogate father, even if only for a few days.**  

Had Tywin acted like his reputation -- cold, ruthless, punishing -- Arya definitely would have named him to Jaqen.  But he surprised her by patient, cordial, and even sociable.  He helped her with her deception, he fed her, he even let discourtesies slide.

**Remember, Arya had been on her own for months, and she watched her father die -- so Tywin sort of felt like surrogate father to her.** She went from possibly being tortured and killed to sharing a roof and dinner with Tywin.  He showered her with compliments and respect.  He took an interest into her life.  For a young girl, on the run, with no family or old friends, she was feeling warmth for the first time in months.

**TL;DR THEORY -- Arya didn't have Tywin killed because she fell victim to Stockholm syndrome, where a prisoner unwittingly bonds with her captor.**

EDIT: Added more on the definition of Stockholm syndrome.

Examples of this policy include Bronn taking over Jacelyn Bywater's role as commander of the Gold Cloaks, Rast replacing Chett as the instigator of the Night's Watch mutiny, and (more controversially) Gendry serving as an Edric Storm substitute in the Dragonstone plotline. I am curious about the future of this policy, as I think later seasons will require yet more radical book deviations and more instances of characters being condensed. I've outlined a few possible character mergers the show might make using its current cast below. If you're a hardcore purist, this may not be the thread for you, but feel free to contradict any of my suggestions it they seem inconsistent, unworkable, or just plain stupid.    


    **Greatjon Umber**   
In the books, the Greatjon is taken captive after the Red Wedding and, as of ADWD, is still a prisoner at the Twins. It's hard to say if he'll serve an important role in that storyline, but at any rate he does not appear for two books (and in the show we haven't seen him since season 1). In my opinion, the Greatjon could easily take over the role played by his uncles **Hother and Mors**, perhaps directly opposing Roose in the North by aiding Stannis militarily and rescuing Jeyne Poole from Winterfell. I prefer this route to the storyline in the books, as having new characters appear out of nowhere with armies in tow might seem a bit like cheating in the eyes of show-only fans. Greatjon's arc could involve interactions with Davos (trying to persuade him to join Stannis), the Boltons (trying to secure his support for their new regime; Greatjon could also meet Theon at this point), and any of the Northern Houses which are involved in this plotline (Dustin/Manderly/Karstark/etc). If the actor doesn't return or if Greatjon really does need to stay at the Twins, some of these functions could be taken over by **Blackfish Tully**.    


    **Bronn**    
Another popular character who doesn't do much in later books (though he does seem set to become a major player in King's Landing), Bronn could easily have an expanded role in the show. I've listed some storylines where Bronn could possibly play a part in here.    
**King's Landing**: As in the books, Bronn serves as a minor antagonist to Cersei after Tyrion's trial and escape, eventually rising to the rank of Lord of Stokeworth. The problem with this arc is that it gives Bronn very little to do, other than slowly amass wealth and power, which I think he can do in more interesting ways.    
**The Kettleblacks**: Bronn becomes an agent of Cersei, analogous to the Kettleblacks, performing tasks such as the assassination of the High Septon. I've seen this change suggested on the forums before, but I'm not particularly in favour of it, though it could work. Presumably Bronn would not fulfil all the roles of the Kettleblacks (ie he would not join the Kingsguard, have sex with Cersei, etc).    
**The Hunt for Darkstar**: After the maiming of Myrcella Baratheon, Bronn joins/replaces Balon Swann as a bounty hunter searching for Darkstar. I like this change because it involves Bronn in an action-oriented storyline and provides Dorne with a familiar face for viewers.    
**The Hunt for Sansa Stark**: Similar to the above, Bronn joins/replaces Ser Shadrich as a bounty hunter searching for Sansa. This change provides Brienne's storyline with a familiar face, but is not without its problems. The main problem is that Bronn knows what Sansa looks like, so if he were to reach the Eyrie as Shadrich does, he would presumably recognise ""Alayne."" This problem can be avoided if Sansa's disguise is good enough, or if Bronn gives up on the hunt before reaching the Eyrie. My ideal plotline for Bronn would involve him starting out hunting for Sansa with the Mad Mouse, encountering Brienne, then abandoning the hunt as a wild goose chase, leaving Shadrich (who goes to the Eyrie as he does in the books) while Bronn himself goes to Dorne to look for Darkstar (I am not entirely sure it this can work, timeline-wise).    
**Ilyn Payne**: Bronn becomes Jaime's sparring partner and accompanies him on the road to Riverrun. While the trailers for season 4 demonstrate that Bronn is definitely taking over some of Payne's functions, it's not clear if Bronn will stay with Jaime.    
**Hyle Hunt**: Bronn joins Brienne on her quest and ends up getting captured by Lady Stoneheart.    


    **Thoros of Myr**    
Another great character (and casting choice in the show), Thoros rarely appears after ASOS. His main function after Beric's death is to provide continuity between the old Brotherhood Without Banners and its later incarnation under the leadership of Lady Stoneheart, illuminating their abandonment of idealism. He also explains Stoneheart's resurrection. In general, I think that these functions could be taken over by someone like Anguy, enabling Thoros to take on another role: **Moqorro**, the red priest encountered by Tyrion and Victarion on their journeys to Daenerys.
While this initially seems unworkable, my projection of events would go as follows: Thoros abandons the Brotherhood after Beric's final death, perhaps realising that Beric cannot be Azor Ahai reborn and that Daenerys is a more likely candidate. Thoros then travels towards Meereen, encountering either Tyrion or Victarion (or both). This would allow the viewers to learn all about the Azor Ahai prophecy and try to deduce who it refers to (Daenerys/Stannis/Beric/Jon/etc). Of course, the fact that both Thoros and Moqorro may both have important roles to play could render this theory unworkable. Moreover, the showrunners may want to add more racial diversity to the cast.    


    **Meryn Trant**    
In the show, Meryn has already taken over the role of his comrade Boros Blount, and although Meryn could easily continue as the Kingsguard's resident asshole, he could take on the roles of some of his other comrades, most notably **Osmund Kettleblack** (Meryn is already an agent of Cersei so this does not seem like much of a stretch, although they probably wouldn't have sex) or **Balon Swann** in Dorne (though the show's Kingsguard could benefit from having at least one actually honourable member).    


    **Salladhor Saan**    
Salladhor is yet another memorable character and the actor is perfect for the role. In the books, he eventually abandons Stannis's cause and returns to a life of piracy, but I think the show could put Salladhor to good use. He could easily remain in Stannis's service and take over the role of someone like **Richard Horpe** or **Justin Massey** (I think he's well-suited to taking over the latter's role, given that Massey's flirtation with Asha would be consistent with Salladhor's personality).
An alternative, which relies heavily on speculation, would be that Salladhor could abandon Stannis as he does in the books and then take over whatever role **Aurane Waters** is to play in future books. This second theory is based on the assumption that Waters exists solely to provide ships for someone (possibly Daenerys), as I believe that Waters can be safely lifted out of the story otherwise (viewers don't need further opportunities to see Cersei act stupidly).    


    **Mord**    
The gaoler at the Eyrie, Mord is a funny and memorable character who could easily be brought back into the show. In my opinion, the best way to do this would be to have Littlefinger use Mord as a scapegoat for Lysa's murder, giving him the role fulfilled by **Marillion** in the books. Mord is not particularly bright and could probably be manipulated by Littlefinger into taking the fall for Lysa's death. This change would have the advantages of demonstrating once more how ruthless Littlefinger can be, and providing a nice bit of symmetry with season 1, as Mord would be imprisoned in the sky cells where he once brutalised Tyrion.    


    **Wisdom Hallyne**    
The chief of the pyromancers, Hallyne could form a part of Cersei's Small Council in order to minimise the influx of new characters in her storyline.    


    **Lame Lothar and Black Walder**    
The most prominent members of House Frey in the show (other than Lord Walder himself), they could serve as general representatives of their family, replacing characters like **Hosteen and Aenys** in Winterfell, **Rhaegar, Jared, and Symond** in White Harbour, **Ryman** besieging Riverrun, or even **Merrett and Petyr**, victims of the Brotherhood Without Banners.    


    **Steelshanks Walton**    
Steelshanks is a Bolton soldier tasked with returning Jaime to King's Landing. He later appears at Ramsay's wedding to Jeyne Poole/""Arya Stark."" In the show, he could serve as a general Bolton envoy throughout Westeros, or even end up as a victim of Mance Rayder's spearwives.    


    **Pyp**    
A close friend of Jon Snow, the show's version of Pyp is a somewhat tragic character: he was sent to the Wall after being molested by a nobleman. Perhaps, then, he could take a darker turn, and replace **Dareon**, the Night's Watch recruiter who is killed by Arya in Braavos for deserting the order.

During the red wedding in the show, we see that Catelyn gets tipped off that something was wrong by first hearing Rains of Castamere being played and then Roose Bolton's chain mail. I remember reading somewhere that in the books however, there were many hints leading up to the wedding that Catelyn noticed + other hints that the reader was getting, so my first question is what were those other hints?
My second question is also relating to the books and about why Catelyn got suspicious. In the books after Rains starts to play, some Frey man rejects dancing with one of Robb's girl companions and then proceeds to storm off from the hall....this then tips Catelyn off and she discovers that he is wearing chain mail and thus RW begins. What I don't understand is how did the Frey man not dancing be enough of a ""hint"" to Catelyn that something was wrong? In the show its quite obvious as Roose looks at his sleeve which Cat sees and then discovers the chain mail, but in the book it was confusing for me. Help for these two questions will be appreciated.

I think Martin's scope is bigger than that particular 30-year period from the 1450's to the 1480's. So I took in the whole of the 15th century, and found some interesting parallels.

I don't, despite the Westerling/Woodville connection, see Robb as Edward IV. I see *Robert Baratheon as Edward IV*, as both men were powerful in the field and loved the ladies.

Joffrey reminds me of *Richard II*, who was well before the Wars of the Roses. From around the same time, *Harry ""Hotspur"" Percy* seems to bear a closer resemblance to Robb.

To the Lannisters, Tywin just screams *""Warwick the Kingmaker""* at me, and Cersei bears a passing resemblance to *Margaret of Anjou*.

And Ned? I keep thinking of *Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester*, the first regent of Henry VI, who was loyal but ineffective, destroyed by court intrigue, and wound up dead.

These connections aren't perfect, of course, and it's entirely possible (indeed, probable) that Martin intended characters not as stand-ins for these people, but expressions of events and ideas that fit the fire-and-blood mood of the times.

I discuss these calls with more detail, including areas where the parallels don't fit, at my blog [here](http://andrewjpatrick.com/2014/03/28/game-of-roses-or-how-george-r-r-martin-gave-new-names-to-historical-persons/).

I've been a huge fantasy fan since I was a kid, so I was expecting to enjoy this a lot. What I saw instead was just an incredibly adolescent male fantasy. That I think this is pretty bad, since I pretty much am an adolescent male myself. Still...
The ""orgy"" scene at the wedding and the guy killing the other guy for taking his woman was absurd.
The throwing the kid from the window at the end of the episode was transparent shock value. I wasn't shocked.
The innocent blonde girl getting married to the dark-skinned bad ass seemed borderline racist and extremely clichd.
I have more gripes with the episode, but basically it boils down to an annoyance with the gratuitous violence and sex that seems geared towards appealing to a 13yr old.

I proposed the idea that maybe someone has already created a nice picture of Ned Stark being executed. Obviously, the piece would have to look different than the show, and not be very branded to GOT. If anyone knows of someone who has created a piece like this, we can give them $100 as well as credit in the album notes.

--------

After finding out that episode 10 is titled The Children, it has me wondering some things. I'm hoping I'm wrong but I believe there's a chance it lends to the theory that Lady Stoneheart has been cut.

The title of the past finales have usually been directed at the final scene:

- Season 1: Fire and Blood - Dany is reborn from fire and blood and the Dragons hatch

- Season 2: Valar Morghulis - This one's a bit weaker, but still maintains the theme of the impending doom of the Other's marching south

- Season 3: Mysha - The word chanted by the slaves in the last scene of the season


What if The Children of the Forest being revealed is the final scene of season 4? It definitely has enough impact to be a final scene if done properly.

With that said I certaily DO NOT want Stoneheart to be cut. By creating this thread I just wanted to get a discussion going around the topic. David and Dan know how the series will end, and if they know that Stoneheart does not play a major role in the end, they might ultimatly decide to dedicate her potential screentime elsewhere and create new storylines for Brienne and Jaime.

I list a few possibilities on why this may have happened:

1. It fit the story; only Arya and Sansa were going to King's Landing and therefore it had to be Lady who paid for Nymeria's crimes, and therefore it's purely a coincidence;

2. The girls' direwolves would only get in the way of their storyline; Arya, frequently on the run and often anonymous, couldn't really do this with a giant wolf walking around with her. Sansa couldn't really be a miserable prisoner cut off entirely from the North if she had Lady. The loss of their direwolves simply makes GRRM's intended storyline possible;

3. Since Lady paid for Nymeria's crime, Sansa is without a wolf and Nymeria is leading a large pack of normal wolves. Arya, the wild child, is off with the Faceless Men and may give up her identity as a Stark once and for all. Meanwhile, Sansa herself is becoming more cunning, and it makes sense that she, perhaps with Harry the Heir, perhaps without, will someday attempt to take Winterfell back. If Sansa becomes somewhat of a general, it is possible that somehow Nymeria joins her. Sansa with a wolf would bring back memories of Robb with his wolf, and it may help rally the North behind Sansa.

4. In ADWD, Arya has more dreams where she becomes Nymeria. Bran started warging when he was trying to escape his own life as a cripple. It is reasonable to assume that Rickon, orphaned, abandoned by all his siblings aside from Bran, may be warging as well. It is conceivable that becoming a girl without a face may encourage her to be able to warg with Nymeria, especially if she ever comes back to Westeros, as warging seems to be somewhat dependent on proximity. If Arya hears about Sansa attempting to retake Winterfell, Arya could potentially aid her with an army of wolves.

5. Rickon, assuming he can freely warg with Shaggydog, may descend on Winterfell at the same time as Sansa does, with or without Nymeria. Remember, the forces bringing the two Stark children to take back Winterfell are completely separate. It's possible they clash when they arrive. Rickon may well be a savage and Shaggydog by now could be monstrous and completely unruly. A showdown with Rickon and the wolfless Sansa may play out as a Shakespearean tragedy -- the once proud Starks reduced to mere pawns, killing each other over a burnt castle in the middle of winter. Contrarily, if Rickon and Sansa met, and Sansa has Nymeria, the wolves would make an inate connection that would transfer to Sansa and Rickon (remember the wolves howling when Bran fell from the tower). If this happens, I see them taking Winterfell together and Sansa mothering Rickon (as she did for Robert Arryn) until Rickon is old enough to rule in his own right. 

These are just my more thought-out theories. The direwolves have played a decent role in the books--they have their moments where they save the day, in particular -- but I feel they must become much more important plot-wise later on. Feel free to discuss any other theories you may have!",16,21,False,self,,,,,

I'm a big fan of the television series and was really excited to read the books, but I just finished reading A Clash of Kings (in the span of 24 hours, so perhaps I need some distance from it to appreciate it more) and I'm sort of underwhelmed. The TV Series, to its credit, seemed very faithful to the book, with some exceptions, even lifting dialogue straight from it- but I sometimes felt like I was reading a slightly more detailed version of the script. Besides the very cool backstory glimpses you get (which I happened to gather off this subreddit anyway) and the fact that the books have far fewer plot holes (I always thought it odd that Shae could just lurk about the Tower of the Hand unnoticed), there wasn't a ton that was new. I'm worried that having seen the characters in the show has also influenced my view of the characters in the books, which was really hard to overcome. I definitely liked it- it was written well enough- and the added details definitely made the story much better for me, but, with how faithful the series seemed to be to the book, the visual thrill of watching the series (I mean, c'mon- that art direction!) almost makes the books less necessary. 

TLDR: Watched the show, read the book, felt underwhelmed because the two seemed quite similar.

In the last installment (which can be read [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/215ff9/no_spoilers_history_of_the_targaryen_dynasty_pt_5/) we covered the major happenings of the Blackfyre rebellion and up to the end of the conflict.  Daemon Blackfyre is dead but his sons and brutal half-brother Aegor ""Bittersteel"" Rivers still live across the narrow sea, and Daeron II Targaryen, victor of the conflict, remains King... and we will resume our history lesson there..but before we begin..

- Note on Spoiler Scope:  While, as with most of the threads the vast majority of the material covered will be general lore, with this particular thread I will have to delve into some spoilers that happened during the events of the Novella series, ""The Tales of Dunk and Egg""  particularly the first and third installment (The Hedge Knight, and The Mystery Knight).. While I will try to avoid as much spoilers I can for the novellas, a major character death from the first novella, as well as a major plot point for the third novella will be covered... That being said, no ""main series"" spoilers will be in this post, and should be tagged in the comments.....  with that all in order lets start..

**-The Post War Targaryen Family, and the remaining reign of king Daeron II**

The war has been won, Daemon Blackfyre has been defeated, and the throne is secure for King Daeron II Targaryen.. and it was during the war and in the post war years that King Daeron II saw his family flourish in size to perhaps the largest in its history, certainty as large as it was since before the ""Dance of the Dragons"" nearly a century prior.  His son, heir, hand of the king, and hero of the Blackfyre rebellion Baelor Breakspear by his side and loved by the small folk, as were Baelor's sons Valaar, and Mantarys.  Daeron's other three sons Aerys, the insane Rhaegal, and Maekar Targaryen, as well as Maekar's sons Daeron ""The Drunken"", Aerion ""Brightflame"", Aemon (a Maester of the Citadel), and young Aegon closed out the ranks of the Large Targaryen family at the time.   Daeron II kept his half brother Bloodraven as his master of whisperers, to some disdain of the people who proclaimed him a sorcerer, in fact his reputation of knowing the goings-on of Westeros at the time is chronicled in a song titled ""A Thousand Eyes and One"".   Little did they know that the rumors of sorcery were not far from the truth....

And so was the post war years of King Daeron II, the family grew and the Targaryen family reached their height of popularity with the common folk.  Dorne was now firmly settled as subjects of the king and had many positions among the small council.  Sadly the last few years of Daeron II's reign were less kind to the king.  His son and heir Baelor was killed in a mishap during the tourney at Ashford (as chronicled in ""The Hedge Knight""), and a great plague, known as ""The Great Spring Sickness"" swept the kingdom killing tens of thousands.  It was this sickness that took the lives of King Daeron II himself, as well as his most immediate heirs Valaar, and Mantarys in 209AL.  The Iron Throne would pass to Daeron II's second son Aerys I.


**-Aerys I and his hand**

If there was ever a king who had little to no interest in ruling it was King Aerys I Targayen.  Inheriting the throne from his father, Aerys was much like Daeron, very intelligent and learned, but Aerys I perhaps took this too far and favored books over rule, never concerning himself with interests of the state or fathering heirs.  The former he left to his hand of the King, and his uncle Brynden Rivers, aka Bloodraven.  This appointment was somewhat unpouplar with the lowborn and highborn alike.  As the lowborn did not like Bloodraven for the reasons mentioned in the previous section, and there were still highborn lords who had sided with the black dragon during the rebellion who loathed him for his harshness and want to punish the rebels after the war, despite the leniency that the then King Daeron II and prince Baelor had offered.  

The realm was also at a loss and unsafe for travel during Aerys I's reign.. while in recovery the realm was still suffering from the Great Spring Sickness, and a new drought and famine was beginning to hurt the seven kingdoms... and those who suffered blamed their King, and lord Bloodraven. All in all Aerys I was a weak king, who despite Bloodraven's attempts to quell any disquiet in the realm couldn't be bothered to tend to issues himself.  Dagon Greyjoy, the then lord of the Iron Islands reaved and pillaged without challenge for quite some time until the Targaryens were forced to intervene, and then there was the issue of the Blackfyres, Daemon's children as well as the King's uncle Bittersteel still schemed and plotted across the narrow sea... The potential for further rebellion from the that bastard line of Targaryens was fully realized in what came to be known as the ""Second Blackfyre Rebellion"".  

***(Note, this next paragraph spoils a large part of the 3rd D&amp;E novella ""The Mystery Knight"", skip if you wish to... I'll limit  ""The Mystery Knight"" spoilers to just this paragraph)***

The Second Blackfyre rebellion, came to be at a tourney at the castle of White Walls, hosted by Lord Butterwell celebrating a marriage to a daughter of the then Lord Frey.  In reality the tourney was a ruse by former rebels in an attempt to showcase the abilities of Daemon II Blackfyre, son of Daemon Blackfyre, who posed as a mystery knight known as ""John the Fiddler"" in an attempt to garner support to once again raise an army to challenge the Iron Throne..  Fortunately for the realm, the second rebellion never went past the walls of White Walls, as unbeknownst to the rebels, a Targaryen prince Aegon was in attendance at the tourney, squiring for the knight known as Ser Duncan the Tall.. Their actions along with the actions of Lord Bloodraven (once he was informed) quelled the rebellion before it had a chance to start.  Daemon II Blackfyre was taken captive and a war was averted.. It is not known what the eventual fate of Daemon II was, other than he remained a prisoner at Kings Landing, so Bittersteel could not attempt to crown any other Blackfyre.  White Walls was destroyed and no longer exists due to the attempt to make rebellion once more.  **(End of ""The Mystery Knight"" spoilers)**


And thus was the reign of King Aerys II, oblivious to all the goings on of the realm during his reign and content with the pages of his books.  He died childless, and the crown went to his youngest brother, and 4th son of King Daeron II... Maekar I Targaryen.

**-King Maekar and another great council**

Maekar I's rule was more involved than that of his brother Aerys, but he was none more fond of rule and kingship.  He was a bitter king, but efficient at rule during a time of relative peace.  At it was he who laid the blow who had accidentally killed his brother Baelor Breakspear at the Tourney at Ashford, he regarded his inheritance of the Throne as punishment for being a Kinslayer.  One of the more notable deeds of Maekar's reign was the imprisonment of the former hand of the King, Bloodraven, who he had never been fond of, Bloodraven would remain in the dungeons of the Red Keep for the duration of Maekar's 12 year reign.  

All that is said of King Maekar's death is that he died in battle to a ""rebel lord"" in 233AL. The circumstances of this have not been elaborated on by GRRM.. perhaps future Dunk and Egg Novellas will elaborate, it is likely that this could have been the result of another Blackfyre rebellion (it is heavily implied that several more attempts were made by the Blackfyres than the 3 that are thus far noted in GRRM's writings).  

Despite the vagueness that was King Maekar I's death, one thing he left in his wake was a massive issue of succession, who would follow him to the Throne?   His two eldest sons had died before him.  Daeron ""The Drunkard"" (who would have been Daeron III) had died of a pox caught from a whore, and left only a feeble witted daughter for a child.  Maekar's second son Aerion ""Brightflame"" was a blight to the Targaryen, mad and cruel had spent years banished across the narrow sea for his outlandish behavior, particularly for his actions at the Tourney at Ashford (once again chronicled in the first D&amp;E novella ""The Hedge Knight).  Aerion had believed himself to be a dragon incarnate, and drank of wildfire to unleash the beast within him, this plan did not go as planned and cost Brightflame his life. Aerion left a son, still across the narrow sea.  

So a council was summoned to choose a successor to the Iron Throne, and crown a new king.  The council deemed it appropriate to pass over Daeron ""The Drunkard's"" feeble daughter, as well as Aerion Brightflame's son, and offer the crown to the third son of Maekar, Aemon Targaryen.  Aemon Targaryen, was offered the kingship of Westeros, but declined the offer.  As a Maester of the Citidael, he was a man of servitude, and loyalty to his family, and did not want a crown.  It was then that the crown was offered to Aemon's youngest brother and 4th son to Maekar, Aegon Targaryen, aka ""Egg"" (the second of the titular characters of the Dunk and Egg novellas).  In a last showing of loyalty, Maester Aemon decided it appropriate to then take the black and join the Night's Watch as to assure no issues with Aegon V's succession, and for him to never be used to challenge the rule of his brother, whom he loved, by a rebel lord.  One of the last things Aemon told Aegon before leaving for the wall was ""It takes a Man to rule, and Aegon, not an Egg, kill the boy and let the man be born"" 

Aegon ""The Unlikely"", named because he was a 4th son of a 4th son, and at one point over 10th in line of succession, never expected to inherit the throne became the 15th Targaryen monarch to rule Westeros.   His first deed was sending an honor guard with his brother Aemon to the Wall, sending most of the prisoners of the dungeons of the Red Keep to the wall along with Aemon; among them was the former hand of the King, Lord Bloodraven, who would go on to become lord commander of the Night's Watch.   Aegon V, also named his best friend and closest companion, ser Duncan the Tall as lord commander of his Kingsguard, whom he had squired for as a boy... and thus began the rule of a fan favorite of the Targaryen Monarchs..... but that is unfortunately where I leave you for today.   

---------------------------------------

Join me next time when we go into the somewhat controversial rule of king Aegon V, see the last of the Blackfyre rebellions, and a tragic end to his rule.  A lame duck king, and finish the series with the early years of the final Targaryen ruler, Mad King Aerys II... until then, thanks again for reading...

Then it will be time for the first proper installment of the ""Adding Context for Non-Readers"" for the new season after that.  As I don't know what topic that will cover (as I will need to see what pops up in the episode to elaborate on) that will likely be out sometime the following Monday (or Sunday, sometime after the new episode if I feel up to it that night)...
