So I was thinking about how ""Bitter sweet"" the ending is supposed to be and how the events in the show are going to play out. I'm going to bullet point this theory so I'm expecting you to have a decent understanding of what is happening and some history of the white walkers.

This theory is something I've come up with myself. I've purposely not been watching or reading theories. but it may have already been established by someone else. If it has, Forgive me.

* So episode 1 &amp; 2 will be character reunions, set up, defence planning, etc. This is essentially already confirmed just like episode 3.
* Episode 3 we will see the giant battle. Westeros will lose and all the north will retreat south.
* Episode 4 will be travelling south and Cersei travelling north to attack the remnants of the northern army.
* Episode 5 They will all converge at the neck near where the heart tree is. Then we will see the battle between Cersei and the northern army. Halfway through or near the end of this battle, the Night King shows up and ""Oh shit it's real"" says the mad queen. They battle either the rest of the episode or the beginning of episode 6.
* Episode 6 will have Bran explaining what actually happened last time. \[unconfirmed info\] How Azor Ahai is actually the same person as the Nights King (13th commander of the nights watch) and how he turned his wife into a white walker to keep the peace while they ruled over the wall and gave sacrifice to the Night King \[/unconfirmed info\]. I was originally thinking Jon would kill Dany, turning her into a white walker, him into the new Nights King and they would give their child as a sacrifice to the Night King. But what I think is more likely and a better ending is if its Jaime killing Cersei and they give their child as a sacrifice to the Night King. Dany dies during the battle along with Rhaegal, and Drogon and Jon take the iron throne with Jon and Dany's son to be the heir.
* Episode 7 will show the aftermath of all of this and how Westeros is completely destroyed and all the political changes of the world afterwards.

1. This would cover ALL of the prophecies and give us an ending that would never be forgotten.
2. If Jon kills dany, that's boring. Their relationship isn't established enough to make me care.
3. Jaime killing Cersei would fulfil her prophecy and be heartwrenching.
4. It would give Bran a very important role.
5. The hero (Jon) would be Alone and forced to rule over the kingdoms. Something he never wanted to do but is now duty bound.
6. The Heroine (Dany) would be dead along with half of Westeros.",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I nominate Sansa. There are a ton of reasons regarding storytelling, plot progression and drama to kill her off. However from an in-world point of view, there must always be a Stark in Winterfell, and the only other candidates still living are Arya and Bran, neither of whom are shaping up to be the stay at home and run the farm types.

Season 4. 
Tyrion: When have you ever done something that wasnt solely in your interest but for the betterment of the family? 

Tywin: the day you were born I wanted to carry you to the sea and let the water wash you away.  I let you live and brought you up as my son because you are a Lanister.

Tywin doesnt say I let you live because you are MY son. He says I brought you up as my son. 
Tywin is always very deliberate with his words. This is one clue to the fact that Tyrion is not of Tywins line. Most likely the child of King Aerys who alone would have been able to have his way with Joanna without suffering open recourse from Tywin. Any other man would not have been able to get close to Joanna. If it did happen, that man would have been killed on the spot and there would have been eyes and ears to carry forward the stories.

Drogon is about 6 Years old at the end of s7, that means that Arrax, the little Dragon who was ripped apart by Vhagar who was about 7 or 8 times his size, if not more, and 65 Years old, was even older and thus bigger as Drogon and Vhagar was even smaler than Balerion.

He avenged the red wedding and betrayed the Starks, which was of course sinister. However Tywin planned the red wedding, but nobody considers him sadistic or ""evil"" per se. 

Roose did a few ""moral"" things  such as proclaiming Ramsay as a bolton, or when  he freed Jaime and apologised on behalf of his soldiers.

As the months pass, news arrives of the destruction of other northern castles and cities such as Oldtown, The Eyrie, etc, and the progress south of the Night King's army. Dany's pregnancy progresses, but her condition weakens. Pressure grows on Jon and co to sacrifice her, but he stands firm.
Theon arrives with supplies which are most welcome. Melisandre is with him, much to the anger of Davos.
A plan is hatched by Varys &amp; Tyrion to fly a dragon over the walls, and open the gates from the inside. 
They convince Jon that only he will have a chance to control Dany's dragons now, given Dany is unwell and Jon has Targaryan blood.
""Night Ghost"" attacks Jon's tent - Jon kills him, and now knows the rest of the Night King's army will soon be upon them.

Episode 6: 
Remaining Protagonists in the final Battle with Night King and Army of Dead. 
The Wildfire Cersei had planted is useful in the battle. Dundarion dies in efforts to light this fire with his flaming sword. 
Melisandre and Varys die also in this battle, but Melisandre... in her last breath... notices Jaime Lannister's golden hand, and tells him he is the Lord of Light just before she dies. 
Jaime Lannister armed with valyrian steel, flies atop the one remaining living dragon, which Bran has warged into... and this unlikely partnership kills the Night King in an aerial battle.
Jaime dies a hero in Briennes arms. Now his pages can be filled.
Bran also dies because of volatile warging.
Dany gives birth to a healthy boy, but shortly afterwards succumbs to her weakened condition and dies in Jorah's arms.

All dragons die.
Arya's list is complete.
Jorah is redeemed / forgiven by Lyanna Mormont.
A new era dawns, under the rule of the newborn Targaryen boy. Tyrion is to be steward of the throne until he comes of age, and he forms a council with Davos, Jorah and Missandei. Grey Worm becomes head of the Kingsguard.
In the North, there must always be a Stark in Winterfell - Sansa. Brienne and Tormund escort her north again as her appointed stewards and hint at getting together.

But it probably will as the year progresses, anyways I wanted to ask when the War against the White Walkers is over which religion will be dominated in Westeros. Its definitely NOT going to be the faith of the Seven as they seem to be setting up the fall of the Faith, I dont imagine the Drowned God becoming the dominate religion, so what will it be? The Red God, the Old Gods, or both? Personally I think a good way to go with this storywise would be that at the end they create a system where all the religions (with the exception of the Great Other) are seen as equal and a Sept is built for all the gods. The Red God, the Drowned God, the Old Gods, and maybe even The Faith of the Seven but thats 50/50.

Happy New Year (and Happy Game of Thrones last season Year! ) 

Let's go:

**Daenerys**: 30%  dies (childbirth), 70% survives

 **Jon**: 30% dies (fighting NK), 70% survives 

**Cersei:** definitely Dies (ask Arya) 

**Arya:** Survives, and this one is beyond discussion

**Sansa:** Survives, she always survives and she'll continue to do so. 

**Greyworm**: 40% dies (Wights), 60% survives 

**Jaime:** He dies (WW), Sorry 

**Tyrion:** 80% dies, 20% survives (its game of thrones, sorry)

**The Mountain:** Dies, for good (ask the hound)

**The Hound:** 60% dies (after beating his brother) 40% survives 

**Dragons:** 85% die (Cersei's Army or GG), 15% survive (I wish they survive though)

**DireWolves:** Survive (because Ghosts don't die, and Nymeria is an Arya version Direwolf)

**Bran:** 30% flies...I mean dies (Wights), 70% survives

**Beric:** Dies

**Tormund:** Dies

**Malissandre:** Dies (I think her death needs to have something to do with ice and fire)

**Robbin Arryn:** Survives  

**Khal Qhono:** Dies

**Jorah:** Dies (maybe to save Daenerys?)

**Qyburn:** 75% dies, 25% flees to bravos

**Yara:** survives

**Theon:** 80% dies, 20% survives

**Euron:** Dies

**Iron Throne:** Dies (or gets destroyed, burned, melted down...whatever you prefer)

**Sir Davos:** Survives",26,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

3. How did Arya survive a ton of deadly stab wounds, yet Robb perished almost immediately by less?
4. If Jagen H'ghar is as powerful as he is (being able to swap identities at anytime) then why did he allow himself to be imprisoned for so long, and possibly burn to death if it wasn't for Arya saving him?
5. If The Children of the Forest turned a man into the Night King by stabbing him with dragonglass, then how is it that dragonglass is one of the ways to kill the Wights???

I'm actually totally fine with the episode, it's definitely one of my favorites to watch and the weird timeline was never really that unbelievable to me. So I don't dislike it outright, although I recognize there was potential to be even better with just some marginally tiny tweaks, which is frustrating.

But we see that the Hound can break the ice with his hammer with one swing. If they were on that island for anywhere between a day to several days (I personally thought it was about a day and a half) they could've had the Hound and Tormund and even Jon take turns continuing to smash the ice around the island without falling into the water.

I know I'm overthinking this episode, but still. Seems like it would've saved them a lot of trouble even if they fell into the water a couple times.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.

No, Ned said with sadness in his voice. Now it ends.

This is the quote from the book. the shows quote it slightly different, but essentially the same.  

I have a poorly formed idea in my mind that G RR Martin is using this conversation to hint at some time loop, or the cyclical nature of time/history.  If one picks a point on a circle it could just as well be the beginning or the end of a path. Weve been shown many themes repeating themselves throughout the generations via flashbacks and Brans greenseeing. Weve also seen that there are conversations that are nearly identical in different generations.  I dont think the fighters know this, they are saying some bad ass shit before a fight to the death. 

I was hoping you, the community could help me crystallize this idea.  What do you think?  Is there some sort of time loop where the same events keep happening over and over?  Is Bran trying to intervene in this loop and end it?  Is it a message about history repeating itself?  Im eager to hear your thoughts!",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ive also been watching theory videos on YouTube and what not, but the one theory I havent seen much at all and the one that I think is a possibility for the end is that Jamie Lannister will be the Azor Ahai (idk how to spell this name) of game of thrones final season. Of all the characters in the show Jamie is my favourite because he actually demonstrates legitimate character development. He was so arrogant and cocky in the first season but after his 2 season character arc in which he grows an appreciation for someone other than himself and those who share his family name. He also finds some kind of peace in his role of killing the mad king, and the dishonour it brought him. His morals perfectly line up and he has been shown to make the hard decisions when the hard decisions need to be made. I just think that it would be such a great ending if his missing hand turns into fire and he grabs his sword which also becomes fire. It would catch a lot of people by surprise and definitely wouldnt be poorly received.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Something triggered the White walkers before any of the books, and I think I figured it out.  Starks say 3 things over and over. Winter is Coming, The North Remembers, and There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.  That last one is curious to me unless it is related to the other two.  If over time people stopped explaining why these three phrases are important and the North forgot and a Stark was not in Winterfell, then the Winter would come.  This happens after Benjen goes to the Wall and Neds brother and father die... He goes to war with Robert... and leaves Winterfell without a blood Stark, even if he leaves his wife.  I believe that the reason there must always be a Stark at Winterfell is to keep the White Walkers Dormant.  Personally i think it has to do with the connections the WWs have with the Starks and that they are connected by blood.  Also possible they were dormant in the crypts and the iron swords rusting away and the absence of Stark blood and Ice awoke the WWs who fled north where they gained power and returned south with their army.

The banner men would have belonged to several big northern houses whose support Roose clearly got when he was declared the warden. 
In my opinion they should have shown Roose keeping his involvement in the Red Wedding covert. That way could go back to the North and pretend to mourn the Starks and the banners men. It would then have been more convincing to see none of the other big houses trying to overthrow the Boltons from Winterfell. ",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I don't think Dany will make a good ruler because she is too ruthless.  I think she's  going to become the villain.  We have seen several characters turn from villain to hero (The Hound, Jamie), it seems only fitting that someone would have a hero to villain arc.  It seems that Dany is the perfect candidate.

I'd like to make a couple announcements here regarding the subreddit Discord server. 

First, we will be hosting a **trivia tournament** over the next several weeks, leading up to the start of season 8. We've been hosting trivia tournaments for over a year now, and with almost 2000 questions asked, it's become a popular component of the server.

**We'll host one round every other Saturday, starting this week, on December 5th, 6:00pm ET / 11:00pm GMT.**

**To kick off the tournament, if you win this week, you'll also win a prize!**

Every week the top five scorers will be awarded points, and at the end of the tournament, the competitor with the most points will be crowned the victor.

Next announcement, as the final season of Game of Thrones approaches, **we're looking for more moderators on the Discord server.** If you know about Discord and Game of Thrones, we'd love to see an application from you.

## Even if you're not interested in trivia or being a mod, consider joining the Discord server if you're interested in talking to other GoT/ASoIaF fans!

It is essentially a [SPOILERS] server, so be aware of that before joining.

If you have any questions, feel free to comment here or PM me!

She kills pretty much the entire main cast, and Only Jon, Tyrion, Arya and Dany survive; upon which they are forced into hiding, (we know from leaks that theres 6 episodes and the FINAL fight between living and dead is episode 3), Dany loses another dragon sometime during the fight, maybe against the Night Kings dragon, who they fight 2v1 and one of them dies in the process. 

She then flies off on Drogon(or Rhaegar) to Casterly rock, which was left empty after the Unsullied march out, and she burns it to the ground which doesnt bother Cersei because she couldnt care less about the rock.

Jamie is captured, but Cersei cant bring herself to hurt him. Then when she doesnt expect it (most likely during or after sex), he stabs her in the back pretty much the same way he did to The mad king, making Jamie the king and queen slayer. Dany shows up and she has snapped, becoming pretty much the same as her father. She burns down kings landing, killing everyone in the keep including Jamie who accepts his death covered in Cerseis blood.

Dany takes the throne and is an absolute tyrant, her capital is Dragon Stone.

Then she is also killed eventually, by one of the two characters: Jon, who she trusts because hes her nephew and will continue the Targaryen line with her, so he can get close and kill her 

Tyrion, much akin to how he killed his father.

Jon then installs himself on the throne (regardless of who kills Dany) because the of his claim as a targ but he chooses to keep his name as Snow, he rules with some difficulty early on but ends up reuniting the seven kingdoms, along with the wildlings.

Season 8 ends with Jon asking Tyrion to be his hand, akin to how Rob asked Ned in season 1. Tyrion says yes, and they then look west towards Casterly rock, and it is assumed Tyrion finally gets Casterly rock and is in charge of repairing it. Bronn gets Dragon stone. Bran serves in Jons council.",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

They decided to watch on. 

the first thing they said this morning when they saw me was, I can't believe what happened to Ned! and my mom asked if they're going to introduce new characters because if they keep killing people off like this then there's going to be no characters left. 

after her husband left the room, she confessed that she accidentally read that Ned is it Jon's father, but is actually Jon's uncle. She said, ""So that means the black cloak guy is his dad, right (Benjin)? I don't understand why they would reveal that because it's not like that makes Jon in line for any inheritance. Does Jon ever find out that Ned wasn't his father?"" 

I explained that between reading the books and all of the online discussions that I've been through, I can't really talk to her about it because I don't know what is in the show for what she has seen so far. I hope I get to see her figure it out!!

They decided to watch on. 

the first thing they said this morning when they saw me was, I can't believe what happened to Ned! and my mom asked if they're going to introduce new characters because if they keep killing people off like this then there's going to be no characters left. 

after her husband left the room, she confessed that she accidentally read that Ned is it Jon's father, but is actually Jon's uncle. She said, ""So that means the black cloak guy is his dad, right (Benjin)? I don't understand why they would reveal that because it's not like that makes Jon in line for any inheritance. Does Jon ever find out that Ned wasn't his father?"" 

I explained that between reading the books and all of the online discussions that I've been through, I can't really talk to her about it because I don't know what is in the show for what she has seen so far. I hope I get to see her figure it out!!

A successful way to do it would be to have season 1 as the lead up to the Blackfyre chronicles; begin with the story about Aegon the Unworthy, then at the end of the season he legitimizes his bastards and the conflicts begin. you have mystery, young Bloodraven, Daemon I and the other bastards, Aemon the Dragonknight would be in season 1 and the conflict between he and Aegon IV and Naerys, and not many dragons so no need for the CGI money excuse.

I am a casual viewer, so this is mostly a reaction after season 7 and predicting an event that may happen in Season 8. 

&gt;Does anyone else believe that Brandon Stark is actually the Three Eye Raven? 

By that I mean the old man in the cave been Brandon Stark who got stuck in the past in a future event that will happen in season 8? 

Example; He goes to the past to change something to save someone or keep Wintefell from been destroy by the White Walkers in the future and he has to stay for a very long time in the past.

Why I believe this?

* The Three Eye Raven told Bran that he will get stuck in the past if he stays for long periods of time in the visions. (Foreshadow)

* The Three Eye Raven knew what people to communicate with so they could bring Bran to him. (This is part of another foreshadow for theory down below.)

* Jon's Uncle said that Bran wasn't there and that the Three Eye Raven was reborn. (Future Bran enter present Bran body.) He also claims to know everything in the present and past? How is that possible? Simple.

* Bran is trap in a time-loop. Each time one of Bran's future versions enter his body, past Bran keeps his memories from all his future versions and thus he knows about all the events that happened until now because he doesn't lose the memories of his previous life. 

* He also has with him the children of the forest who created the White Walkers, and knows about Dragonglass. Who wrote the books about this events in the library Sam came from? Probably Future Bran.

* Bran himself claims he is no longer Bran. And doesn't change emotions with his family members, not even to Sansa. I believe that with all the memories of his possible hundreds of Bran's from the future in his mind at the same time and with all the deaths he withness his beyond human affection.

* The Night King recognise the Three Eye Raven in the Cave before been killed and his concious been pass to present Bran.

So what was that about? 

Was the purpose of that scene just to show thataryawas spying on him?

It sounds crazy but I made much more sense since his death was reallycheesyandanticlimactic, it would be something totally in his character to do and I would flip theshitout while watching that the""bird""is alive at end of the long night to now sing the song of ice and fire. 

Another odd thing is him speaking with the other lords after the blonde ladyencounter, he says something to them and then removes himself from the conversation leaving those twostaringat him seeming confused andhonestlyeven angered.

Both the waif and Jaquen are facets of her.

The waif is her naivety as a child. She wants the power to exact her revenge and the more she tries to convince herself she is no one, the more hostile the waif becomes. Reminding her that the reason she is there is not to become a faceless killer who has no business judging who she kills, but to gain the skills needed to kill those she has passed judgment on herself. 

Jaquen represents who she thinks she wants to be- the future version she envisions herself becoming. He challenges her until she herself accepts her situation. He guides her to the truth, ultimately conveying that she must make amends with who she is in order to move into her future.

They are working in concert to bring Arya out of adolescence and into adulthood. It all culminates when Arya uses all of what she has learned from both of them to kill the Waif (her nativity) and ultimately her innocence to accept who she really is, why she really came and what she must do.

Even the play is structured toward this view: Jaquen tells her to kill the actress whos playing cerci. If she were to become faceless like him, killing her cerci will be and feel no different than a random stranger (actress)

The waif kills the actress instead and in a spiteful and violent way, reminding her that she needs to forget becoming faceless and bring the actual cercis life to a violent end.

It all culminates with her killing the waif along with her innocence and nativity and realizing she has to stay a stark and kill for her own reasons. Even mounting the waifs face herself haphazardly with blood everywhere is symbolic- she will serve the god of death, but in her own way.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Jon and Khaleesi destroy the Night King and his army, but it's a war of atrition. After their victory in the North, Cersei's forces kill Jon and Khaleesi and obliterate their depleted armies. Cersei wins the game of thrones. Very last scene is Cersei sitting smugly on the Iron Throne. She then gets assassinated by Arya Stark. The end. 

2. The three eyed raven is secretly responsible for and in charge of the Night King. The white walkers, led by Bran, absolutely massacre everybody and the series concludes with a Westeros extinction.

2) Alfie Allen as Theon

And a distant 3rd
3) Jack Gleason as Joffrey

Drinklage does a fine job, is a great storyteller and a master at sarcasm but has some moments where he cant hit the emotional depths that Headey and Allen do.

Charles dance of course is Charles Dance, what an actor, just has an incredible presence. Perfect choice for Tywin.

Plenty of other honourable mentions, Gillen as slippery bastard Peter Baelish to name but one. 

Allen for me is the most under appreciated actor in the show. The transformation he depicts in his character is so convincing. 

Theon really does look broken and devoid of dignity, as well as crippled with guilt and shame. I just rewatched the show for the first time and holy fuck is he a good actor.

Right now he seems to be a husk of himself, completely void of any emotion. Which, after watching the show, is no surprise. Assuming he went back and 'watched' what happened to his family and those he cares about, he must be just completely numb. He saw:

1. His father getting beheaded.

2. The Red Wedding, where Robb was murdered along with his wife and unborn son, but most importantly his Mother, Cathelyn. He saw the sadness and the way they mutilated his body.

3. He saw all that happened to Sansa. She had to watch Ned's beheading, was humiliated in King's Landing and escaped only to be humiliated and raped in her own home, Winterfell. 

4. He saw Rickon die, after all they'd been through together.

5. He saw Jon's tragic story, who was stabbed to death, only to be resurrected and have to watch his brother die only mere seconds away from being safe.

6. Arya had arguably be the 'best' story because she only saw her brother's corpse being paraded around, saw some friends die and was stabbed in the gut while trying to become no one.

7. On top of all this, he saw someone he considered his brother, Theon, betray them and saw probably many others who he loved die.

On top of all this personal trauma, he also has to cope with being the three-eyed raven, being this all-seeing entity. In short, this is the perfect recipe to mentally fuck up someone beyond repair. A lot of people would probably kill themselves if they went through what he went through.

So my question is, do you think that he will recover? Will he become somewhat normal again? What do you guys think will be his fate?

Not by much, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

I always see people saying ""if you'd seen what he's seen"", ""imagine all the crazy shit he's seen"" etc. It's like he's being compared to a war vet. He's changed by the crazy things he's witnessed. Trauma, battle, death, tragedy.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not it. The truth is more mundane than that.

&amp;#x200B;

Your personality is the combination of everything you have ever experienced. Everything you've seen and done. Imagine you took all of your personal experiences and added in the personal experiences of a single other person to the mix. It's like when you take blue paint and you mix it with yellow paint. Now you have a completely different colour.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine adding the combined experiences of everyone who has ever lived. It's like mixing every colour of paint. You end up with that murky brownish colour that's no colour at all. His personality is gone. It's diluted by everyone else. There's no blue left.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe people have already made this point and I've missed it. I just always see people saying the other thing so I thought maybe there are a lot of people who never thought of it that way.",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I also think people arent going to like the last two books as much as they did the first 3 (a lot of people already think Feast and Dance werent as good).

Dont get me wrong, GRRM is a fabulous writer. But when you stop and look at the fact that the longest book so far, ASOS, which is widely accepted as the best, was published only 2 years after ACOK, it should raise a huge red flag about these last two books taking so long.",30,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In fact, Jorah reminds Viserys that it is ""forbidden"" to carry a weapon in Vaes Dothraki. We are to believe that Jorah does not have a blade because he is obeying the law. We don't really see him armed with one either. During this exchange Viserys say that having or using  a blade is not his law. So, why doesn't he use the sword to force Jorah back and take the eggs?

This is not an ""is Bran the NK"" post. But is the NK just a super powerful warg? I mean, I know he is a Whitewalker, but could he have been a warg anyway?

I was responding to a post about Bran warging Viserion and thought that possibly the fact that Viserion was dead might prevent him from controlling him. *But* if that isn't a stumbling block, perhaps he could hold back/control the wights as well. And then it just occurred to me that maybe raising the dead has nothing to do with being a Whitewalker. Perhaps it's just easier to warg an empty vessel. I'm sure the NK has had an awful lot of practise, but as an uber-warg and the 3ER I reckon Bran has enough power to control at least some of the AOTD.

I watched the battle of Blackwater again tonight, and I had completely forgotten the scene with the hound and Sansa in her quarters when he tells her how everyone she knows is a killer and to look at him because she needs to get used to looking at killers. 


Im sure this has been discussed but why didnt Sansa go with him when offered her a way out and he had protected her/had her back most of the time at Kings landing?

Now we know these swords can be used to kill white walkers. But who will use this sword? The writers wouldn't randomly have Sam take it, so it will probably come into play this season. 

Right now, Jon Snow already has a Valyrian steel sword, so there's only a few prominent people I'd see using Heartsbane. 

First of, Jaime might be wielding this sword. Allthough he isn't the legendary swordsman he used to be, he's still pretty good and he'd be of great use if fighting for Jon/Dani.

Secondly, Jorah. Since Jon received the Mormont family sword, he doesn't have one anymore. He too is a skilled swordsman and would certainly put this sword to good use.

Lastly, maybe Sam himself? He has already killed a white walker with dragon glass. He is a below average swordsman, but he does seem to step up when needed. I could certainly see him kill another white walker to save Gilly or maybe even Jon.

Let me know what your thoughts on this are and if you maybe have any suggestions/additions on this? Thanks!",24,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jaquen is the only FM we see in the House of black and white the whole time aside from Arya and the Waif. We never see any of his peers, only his trainees. (I know FM can wear different faces but we never get to see at least two of them together so i assume there's only one of them in the temple) 
By repeating the list of people she wanted to kill Arya has promised many names to the many faced god/JH so she attracted his attention and he took her as his apprentice. Also i think the whole point of FM training is about strenghtening your personality and getting to know yourself to the degree when you can safely become someone else. That's why Jaquen smiled after Arya proclaimed her real identity before leaving: she was able to switch faces safely later. The whole 'you're no one' talk was meant to teach her to stick to her real identity and motivations, not to ditch her personality. (Even JH showed emotions when Arya gave him his own name, so if his definition of 'no one' was true why didn't he want to die?)That could explain why there are no FM in the temple: after completing their training they go on to become secret assassins and get their revenges, thus serving the god of death. That's why it's in his best interest to train them.
Or perhaps the god of death/Jaquen saw potential in Arya for something big(maybe killing Cersei) just like children of the forest have chosen Bran for their matters. Either way i think both of them are going to play big part in season 8.",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It got me wondering what some of you think is/are some of the best moments were in the show due to the intricate writing and details surrounding said moment.

One in particular that has stuck out to me is Brans fireside telling of the story of the Rat Cook in S3E10 where the cook angered the gods by slaying someone under his own roof and protection so he was forced to spend his days as a rat devouring his young. Fast forward to 3 seasons later when Arya feeds Walder Frey his own sons for killing guests under his own roof and protection (also if any character was to be described as rat-like my money would be on Walder Frey).

Its the little things like those scenes being somewhat intertwined and exactly 3 whole seasons apart that make me love this show more than anything, I was just wondering what some of you had come to see and enjoy in the same way!",18,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm going to start by giving some background then get right into the theory.

\*\*\*Varys is a character who is mildly important, but his motivations and movements are still relatively unknown (he randomly shows up places, for example Mereen). The idea that Varys is helping Daenerys ""for the good of the realm"" is ludicrous to me. Both are blond, entitled, shrewd women with sociopathic tendencies. Can you really say Daenerys is that much better than Cersei? Also, one of the themes of the show is that rulers are all very similar and things are not really that different between one ruler and another. To me, Varys' role in the show is still unexplained.

This being said, here is my theory. I believe that Cersei, after the death of Joffrey, knew or found out that the Tyrell's were involved (Olenna and or Margaery). I believe this is why she immediately went so hard after the Tyrells, imprisoning and destroying Loras, their son and heir, just as the Tyrells destroyed Joffrey.

Cersei knew all along that Tyrion did not kill Joffrey yet was instrumental in imprisoning him because she had a plan. Her plan was to have Varys free Joffrey, and also leave the door to Tywin's room open to have him kill Tywin. Tywin was planning to have Cersei married off to Loras, which would mean her power would be greatly reduced. By having Varys free Tyrion and try to take him to Daenerys (before Jorah Mormont actually does), it immediately gives Varys credibility, and gives Cersei a spy in her enemy's camp.

This will all be revealed in season 8 and i I believe Varys will be revealed as a traitor and murdered. Also we will find that this is why Euron knew where Yara's ships were.

Couple more interesting points...

\*After Tyrion kills Tywin, the show immediately shows Cersei as a young girl, saying ""I am not afraid of my father"" or something similar.

\*When Cersei sees Lancel Lannister and he is wearing the outfit of the sparrows, Kevan Lannister apologizes to Cersei for his outfit and says ""they never would have come to king's landing if tywin was still alive"". Cersei created the sparrows because of her actions, who cause her many problems.",43,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just got done watching Season 5, and just watched Episode 6x02 where Euron Greyjoy is introduced and kills Balon. (I have not seen any more, so don't spoil me). And I have to say I am kind of disappointed in the Character Balon, or what was made of him. Between Seasons 3-5 he is basically non-existent and before that you only know of him being defeated by Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon in his rebellion. He has no character traits other than being a lousy father, and has achieved nothing throughout the series, other than the conquering of Winterfell, which didn't last long and was Theon's work. Despite all that, he is one of the 5 Kings that are named in the war of the 5 Kings (Stannis, Renly, Balon, Robb, Joffrey) and Melisandre throws the thing with Gendriys Blood into the fire calling him out instead of more threatening enemies like Tywin, Dany or Nance Rayder. From what I've heard and (accidentally) read, Euron will be more relevant in the coming episodes, and we might find out more about Balon through him, but I find Balon to be a poorly executed and irrelevant character. The only function he has in my eyes is to be Theon's father. ",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hats off to Lena Headey seriously, every time she smirked on screen I wanted to reach through and punch her in the face. But the biggest problem for me this episode is that Cersei claimed the Iron Throne at the end of the episode. How does she have any claim to the kingdoms? Neither she or her children had any actual claim to the throne. Why didn't the people in King's Landing rebel? We already know they hate her because of the Walk of Atonement.

For those who havent finished the series, dont continue to read.







Ill start off with the Starks.
Sigil: Wolf
One of their main house characteristics is the sense of innocence and nobility. They care about family and will serve the people. They have a pack mentality. If one of their own is in pain or in trouble, they will not stop until they are better or achieve revenge. They are a pack of Wolves, and have chosen the way to prosper.

In the first episode with the Stag and the Dire Wolf, this shows a foreshadowing of the events to come. The Stag represents house Baratheon and the Dire Wolf represents the Starks...No shit sherlock.

Why is this important? Remember the pups? What do the represent? 
The battle between the Stag and the Dire Wolf shows us viewers more behind the scenes...or for the matter of the gods.


Lannisters
Sigil: Lion

The Lannisters are my favorite in terms of how to be leaders.
 Male lions, who are part of a pride, tend to become good leaders for the pride. They are followed by lionesses and their offspring. Lions will kill in the name of their pride, make dire sacrifices, and ultimately the king of the animal kingdom.

The Lannisters are great leaders, but those who benefit from the spoils of war are the Lannisters themselves. Tyrion is not a leader, but a very intelligent man, which makes him a great hand for Dany.

Tywin Lannister is beyond the greatest general during this time. He is bitter, unloving, and colder than the Nights Watch members swords. He cares about family, he cares about his children because the only thing he loves is House Lannister. The lion tends to the needs of the pride.



House Baratheon
Sigil: Stag (basically a fucking deer)

The Baratheons were the ones I really didnt understand. Theres nothing special about them but their undirected pride. 
Rob became king by winning the rebellion...which was helped by the kingslayer.
His two brothers once loved each other...but yeah, sorry bro. 
They are unconventional, they will fight and go to great ends to win their battle. 

Now how does this tie into a fucking stag? Deer/Stags were common, but unpredictable. Being unpredictable often throws your opponents.



House Targaryen
Sigil: A god damn 3 headed dragon wtf

Targaryens are special. They are Valyrian, and they are ancient. Targaryens were dragonriders and was one of a small handful of Valyrian noble houses which fled before the doom. They fled because they suddenly had dreams about the doom of Valyria. Dany (Im too lazy and stupid to know how to spell her name all the time) is immune to fire, dragons and their immunity is tied into her blood. They are vengeful, and inbreeding breeds madness.


SPOLIER SPOLIER SPOILER!!!!!!!!


Why are these houses important and why am I starting this discussion?

Ill show you. The beginning of each episode starts with the sun enveloped with these 4 house sigils. Throughout the show, we see these houses decedents go through unnatural, if not supernatural changes. The Starks with their wolves, proved themselves to be great warriors. The Lannisters with ungodly power. The Targaryens with superhuman abilities. And the Baratheons being unpredictable but successful.

The old gods and the new, have something to do with this...and the young wolf (Bran) sees it all.

Literally.

Jon Snow (aegon), if he does rejoin with his brother Bran...I believe Westeros can be reclaimed.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Plus from ""abduction"" to birth of a child he had no knowledge? Was he not powerful enough at that time? Tywin may have known but with the Lannisters neutral and his plans for Cersi I'd see why he'd take that secret to the grave.

Howland Reed must have just proven loyal and stayed quiet but what about all the other people at the Tower (servants etc) or no one else finding the Maester's convenient log on the marriage of Rhaegar and Lyanna?
Plus no one else noticed Ned went to the Tower in a small group and came back with a baby and suddenly it's like ""hey, a bastard has a appeared"" (unless he went straight to the Dayne's in Dorne to return the sword there which I think he does in the book?)

I may have missed a big hole somewhere so please let me know if I have. Just find it amazing that seemingly only Ned and Howland are the only people to know Jon's true parents (not including people who may use magic like Brann or Melisandre)

This is a reminder of a rewatch schedule I posted 6 months ago, that I still find relevant and hope you do too.

I was creating an overview of how many hours a week my friends and I had to watch Game Of Thrones and was encouraged to share. Link is in the bottom.

Included features:

1. Overall list of episodes (with wiki links).
2. Season time totals.
3. How many episodes you have to watch daily, weekly and monthly (updates daily).
4. Second tab with option to input name and number of watched episodes to recalculate your estimates.

Disclaimers include:

1. Today command set to CET time.
2. A month is set to 30 days.
3. Trolls will be trolls, so either copy to own Google Drive or expect your name to be removed.
4. Release date is set to first of April.
5. You should only be able to change a8 to a100 and b8 to b100 in 'Personal Progress'.

TL:DR You need to watch 37 minutes of GOT every day or 5 episodes per week until release from now on.

The White Walkers by the end of the show will still be depicted as pure evil bad guys, and the Night King might say a word or two to the good guys but this will ultimately result in nothing meaningful. I simply believe that in 6 episodes there will be no time to resolve all the present plot threads while also introducing any meaningful white walker character development.


My Assumptions:


1. There will only be 6 episodes in Season 8 and that season 8 will be the final season (discounting spinoffs/prequel). This has been confirmed by HBO so I think this assumption is pretty fair.


2. Each episodes runtime won't surpass 2 hours. My personal prediction is 1 and a 1/2 hour episodes, but if the episodes do surpass 2 hours I can see white walker development being able to fit in.


3. That any further White Walker ""development"" or ""revelation"" will just be Bran revealing how and why they were made to the rest of the cast. We as spectators have already seen their origin story as products of the Children of the Forest so this won't be anything new to us. If anything, I expect this ""revelation"" to feed into characters discussing and expounding upon the already present themes of ""Cyclical Revenge is bad"" and that the White Walkers will be shown in a ""it's a shame we have to fight them at all. But their nature is evil/we can't coexist"" kind of light.


4. The conflict with the White Walkers will be resolved by a large decisive battle where the Night King is killed or at the least ""removed"" by some other magical means. I believe that if there are any remaining white walkers they will just retreat once the Night King dies with no further explanation. If this is the case the ""heroes and good guys"" will just settle on ""well we beat them this time, humanity should be okay for another few centuries at least"". 


5. Cersei will not abdicate her throne and will force a battle between her forces and the weakened northern Alliance. At the very least she will have to be dealt with separately from the White Walker threat.


My episode outline predictions:


1. Establish all the northern players and show them all in Winterfell. ""Gather your party before going forth"" and establish Winterfell as a staging ground. Progress The plot / showcase the few characters not in the North, probably have survivors from the wall rejoin the main group. I predict this episode to have strong similarities to ep 1 season 1 and many callbacks, establish/solidify themes that will run throughout the season.


2. Either shows the White Walkers sieging Winterfell or shows the Anti-Walker Alliance moving into position to fight a decisive battle. Probably will be a small skirmish to set up the details of how a decisive battle can be won. If there are any additional details revealed about the White Walkers it will probably be here, but only details about how they can be beaten (chop off the head of the snake, etc). Jon Snow parentage/whose claim to iron throne is strongest drama eats up at least half of this episode.


3. The final battle. I haven't decided yet whether this will require one or two episodes, but for the sake of conservative predictions lets let's assume the walkers can be decisively defeated in one episode. This resolves the White Walker threat for either the foreseeable future or for all time.


4. After beating the Walkers, the survivors of the North will now have to deal with Cersei. I think realistically they would just want a break at this point but Cersei will force their hand (attack when your enemy is weakest) and the show is definitely not going to end without a ""good guy"" on the iron throne. Also, Clegane Bowl. I expect this episode to be a victory lap and just a general mopping up. This resolves the Southern threat.


5. Epilogue/character endings, showcase the survivors grieving for the dead and their moving ons. Where they go from there. The end.


6. Wildcard. The above outline showcases plot elements that I think must (or at least, should) happen, but also elements which I think can be condensed into five episodes. Laboring under the assumption that the final battle will only be one episode, then this leaves a single episode for any white walker drama/politics. If this is the case, I really don't think any meaningful or satisfying politics with the White Walkers can be further expanded upon in a single episode. I'll be happy to be proven wrong in this regard, but I just don't see it happening. More realistically I expect the White Walker threat to require two episodes to conclude, be it either a two episode battle or a single episode big battle followed by a second episode final confrontation and mopping up.


My Conclusion:


There is no time this season to create satisfying character development for the White Walkers. This will leave them as the inverse ""black"" in the black and white portrayals the show now seems set on. This is disappointing because the asoiaf novels are much more nuanced and that it's a shame that the ending of the show needs to be rushed into 6 episodes. I hope to be proven wrong on this topic, but we'll see.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sansa Stark did NOT endure her childhood dreams shattering in her hands and morphing into the worst kind of reality a teenage girl could face to be pitted against another abused woman for the attentions of Jon Snow. Sansa was abused physically, emotionally and mentally by the boy she was meant to be betrothed to, the boy shed lied to protect, betraying her sisters trust because she was so enamoured with the idea of him. Ive seen so much criticism for Sansa because of the things she did in the early seasons but everyone seems to forget that she was a CHILD. She was a highborn girl raised to marry a lord and have children and serve him. You cant lambast her for being a product of her upbringing and certainly not for trying to please the boy she was told she would marry and have to spend the rest of her life with. At Kings Landing, she endured so much abuse, being stripped publicly, nearly raped, beaten, all by (indirectly or directly) her betrothed. She was forced to watch her father be beheaded. She was dropped by Joffrey and forced to marry an imp (Ive nothing against Tyrion- he was lovely to her, but even he acknowledged that he was far from the childhood dream of a husband). She literally had to betray her family whilst there in order to survive, forced by Cersei to write letters to Robb, and publicly denounce them as traitors. 
But instead of crumbling in the grasp of the people who destroyed her family, she learned. She watched and played the part and learned how to play the game. Even leaving KL, she was just passed from abuser to abuser. Littlefinger, another man she thought cared for her and her family, another man she thought she could trust, used her as a pawn, forced her to lie for him when her aunt nearly kills her (honestly, how traumatic! She has little family left and her aunt tries to kill her because of LF!), then passes her onto the Boltons, the men who KILLED her mother and older brother. Shes once again forced to marry, and this is literally a nightmare of her former dream, shes raped, forced to live with Theon, the boy she grew up with, who she believes murdered her two younger brothers and betrayed her family. Honestly, how is there even a debate over how strong Sansa Stark is???

And if surviving this wasnt enough, she grows from it. She rises from the ashes of her own destruction. Sansa finds (to her knowledge) her last surviving family member, the half brother she was always cruel to because he represented her fathers folly and mothers heartbreak. She finds him, they take back Winterfell. Yet even JON underestimated her. He doesnt listen when she warns him and yet shes probably the smartest and most clued-in to the dynamics of this perpetual power struggle: she has the knowledge of how the key political families in Westeros operate. Thats why she secretly gets the help of the Vale. Its not a betrayal of Jon (honestly, how can anyone see it this way)- its a recognition that Jon does not understand the politics after being at the Wall for so long but Sansa does. And shes DONE sitting back and being ignored because she knows she is a valuable input and you can guarantee that Jon now knows it too. As if that isnt enough, to save Jons life, she has to go back to her former abuser Littlefinger and practically beg him for help. The sheer strength of that act alone is gobsmacking. But she is DONE with being a pawn, evidenced by her cool (cool as in cold!!) murder of Ramsay and her later exposure of Littlefingers crimes. She knows she was used but you can bet your socks shes not going to let it happen again. 

Sansa Stark is incredibly strong and unbelievably, she gets STRONGER. She rebuilds Winterfell to the fortress it was, wins the loyalties of the Northern Lords back, and shows promise of being a great leader who will not stand for injustice but similarly rules with mercy and compassion; stockpiling food for the upcoming winter, fairly exposing Littlefinger and dealing with his crimes in the open. Sansa is so much more than Jonsa - she has and will continue to achieve more than Jon. If theres one person to survive S8, out of SHEER experience with the game of thrones, Id wager it will be Sansa. 


And on the other hand, you have Dany (I can only refer to her as this because I have honestly no idea how to spell her name! I get the a and e mixed up: Danearys? Danaerys??? I dont have a clue). Now Dany starts in much the same way as Sansa. She is abused by her brother, physically, emotionally and mentally, and pushed around like a political pawn for his own selfish ambitions (remind you of anyone?). She is forced into marriage with a notoriously brutal warrior, who she does not love and who she does not want to marry, but does so to please her brother because she is told it will ensure their birthright and their familys revenge. Again, she is a product of her upbringing with what she believes and why she is subservient to her brothers whims. She is abused by the Dothraki, she tries to do good and tries to teach them compassion and yet, it backfires massively on her and she loses a child and the husband she now loves at the hands of someone she only ever helped. She decides no more will she be the weak wife of the Khal that nobody takes seriously- she stands back during the death of her abusive brother, rears dragons, murders the Khals, sets about being a compassionate and merciful ruler who frees slaves across the country. But the difference here between Dany and Sansa is that whilst Dany means well, she has not had the experience Sansa has had to understand the rationality and the politics of ruling (ex. Morally, she is correct in freeing the slaves but she does nothing to stabilise the economy nor save those fortunate by birth who did not support slavery but who she still murders for owning slaves. Another ex is her reactions and solutions to the problems her people come to her with. She just doesnt understand diplomacy). I think in part she is a victim of her own heritage, as we all know, history repeats itself, just as sons become their fathers, so too does Dany morph into the Mad King. There are echoes of this when, much like the MK, she burns a father and son alive for not bending the knee, and again when she attacks and burns the Lannister army and there is the curious scene beforehand of Lannister soldiers, humanising them, prematurely presenting them as victims to Danys terror. This has merged with another point of mine, that the contrasts between Dany and Sansa only serve to be highlighted by the parallels: Dany burns food, she conquers but she is not a politically-minded leader like Sansa has shown herself to be. They both started off compassionate with ambitions for power (Sansa not so much, I suppose, but she was intended to be Joffereys Queen) and whilst Sansas strive for power has weakened as she becomes more adept at the game of thrones (arguably making her more suitable for the throne), Danys strive for power has reached such a proportion that it can only destroy her. Shes such an incredibly tragic and grey character. She cannot be Queen, as many characters have pointed out, she is a conqueror. Thats off topic though! The point being that after being abused by men for all her life, Dany is now the most powerful woman in Westeros AND Essos with two dragons at her disposal and her abusers scorned. 

Both women have been abused, suffered incredible pain and torment, and not only survived it but come out stronger. Yes, their paths have diverged since. They seek different things now, use their strength differently, but it doesnt negate their individual agency. Yet instead of celebrating these characters for the strong and powerful women they are, the fandom reduces them both to the love interest of a man... I think it needs to stop. Ship Jonsa or Jon/Dany by all means (I ship one of them myself as endgame) but dont let it dominate Sansa or Dany please. Theyre strong female characters who deserve more from us. 

(This is partly in response to the new clip which has just inspired so much either Sansa hate from Dany fans or Dany hate from Sansa fans. Can we please just appreciate them both and stop reducing them to a shipping war! Everyone will probably die in S8 anyway so its all for naught).",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The first two are trivial/jokes and the last one is a virtue masquerading as a flaw. What are some genuine weaknesses in your favorites and some genuine things you have to appreciate about characters you don't like?

I'll start-

Favorite: 
Tyrion- He's often way too prone to self pity and he uses it as an excuse to be a straight up alcoholic. One of these days he's going to to get stumbling drunk and walk right off a ledge by accident. We haven't seen it significantly impact his functioning in the context of the show but realistically it's only a matter of time. Even if he doesn't injure himself, he's frequently drunk when trying to advise people or make important decisions.

Least Fave: 
Sansa- She's a survivor. She's able to swallow her pride, get her game face on, and get through situations where many other characters would only see the short term and get themselves killed. ",54,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If theres one person to survive S8, out of SHEER experience with the game of thrones, Id wager it will be Sansa. 


And on the other hand, you have Dany (I can only refer to her as this because I have honestly no idea how to spell her name! I get the a and e mixed up: Danearys? Danaerys??? I dont have a clue). Now Dany starts in much the same way as Sansa. She is abused by her brother, physically, emotionally and mentally, and pushed around like a political pawn for his own selfish ambitions (remind you of anyone?). She is forced into marriage with a notoriously brutal warrior, who she does not love and who she does not want to marry, but does so to please her brother because she is told it will ensure their birthright and their familys revenge. Again, she is a product of her upbringing with what she believes and why she is subservient to her brothers whims. She is abused by the Dothraki, she tries to do good and tries to teach them compassion and yet, it backfires massively on her and she loses a child and the husband she now loves at the hands of someone she only ever helped. She decides no more will she be the weak wife of the Khal that nobody takes seriously- she stands back during the death of her abusive brother, rears dragons, murders the Khals, sets about being a compassionate and merciful ruler who frees slaves across the country. But the difference here between Dany and Sansa is that whilst Dany means well, she has not had the experience Sansa has had to understand the rationality and the politics of ruling (ex. Morally, she is correct in freeing the slaves but she does nothing to stabilise the economy nor save those fortunate by birth who did not support slavery but who she still murders for owning slaves. Another ex is her reactions and solutions to the problems her people come to her with. She just doesnt understand diplomacy). 

I think in part she is a victim of her own heritage, as we all know, history repeats itself, just as sons become their fathers, so too does Dany morph into the Mad King. There are echoes of this when, much like the MK, she burns a father and son alive for not bending the knee, and again when she attacks and burns the Lannister army and there is the curious scene beforehand of Lannister soldiers, humanising them, prematurely presenting them as victims to Danys terror. This has merged with another point of mine, that the contrasts between Dany and Sansa only serve to be highlighted by the parallels: Dany burns food, she conquers but she is not a politically-minded leader like Sansa has shown herself to be. They both started off compassionate with ambitions for power (Sansa not so much, I suppose, but she was intended to be Joffereys Queen) and whilst Sansas strive for power has weakened as she becomes more adept at the game of thrones (arguably making her more suitable for the throne), Danys strive for power has reached such a proportion that it can only destroy her. Shes such an incredibly tragic and grey character. She cannot be Queen, as many characters have pointed out, she is a conqueror. Thats off topic though! The point being that after being abused by men for all her life, Dany is now the most powerful woman in Westeros AND Essos with two dragons at her disposal and her abusers scorned. 

Both women have been abused, suffered incredible pain and torment, and not only survived it but come out stronger. Yes, their paths have diverged since. They seek different things now, use their strength differently, but it doesnt negate their individual agency. Yet instead of celebrating these characters for the strong and powerful women they are, the fandom reduces them both to the love interest of a man... I think it needs to stop. Ship Jonsa or Jon/Dany by all means (I ship one of them myself as endgame) but dont let it dominate Sansa or Dany please. Theyre strong female characters who deserve more from us. 



(This is partly in response to the new clip which has just inspired so much either Sansa hate from Dany fans or Dany hate from Sansa fans. Can we please just appreciate them both and stop reducing them to a shipping war! Everyone will probably die in S8 anyway so its all for naught).",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

There have been a lot of very, very good actors during its run. For me, the best actor might be Lena Headey. From the beginning she has been utterly compelling as Cersei, stealing every scene and never putting a single expression, tone of voice or emotion out of place. She has portrayed perhaps the most complicated character flawlessly throughout, with even bad writing unable to stop her.

I would also posit Peter Dinklage, though his performances have suffered with the decrease in the quality of material. Alfie Allen has done a very good job with a difficult role as Theon,  and I found Stephen Dillane another who stole every scene during his time as Stannis. I also find Kit Harrington underrated, and always liked Iain Glen and Richard Madden as Jorah and Robb respectively. Oh, and Jack Gleeson, Iwan Rheon and Charles Dance were perfect too. Gosh, and Nikolai Koster-Walder or whatever his name is. Rory McCann... The shortlist is very long. As a top three, let's say Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage and Stephen Dillane.

As for the worst, I'm usually more irritated than moved by Emilia Clark as Dany. Her line in emotionless anger is awful. Isaac Hempstead Wright's Bran is another. All the sand snakes were unwatchable, though whether that was down to their writing rather than their talent is debateable. Faye Marsay as the waif.

I think what I'm noticing here is I don't like over-acting and smug facial expressions.

I havent even watched the teaser from last night yet, Ive heard there was a short clip and Im doing my best to avoid social media. I know its probably not sustainable for the next 4 months but I have a bad habit of always watching every trailer for every show/movie Im excited about and listening to every podcast, reading every article and I end up spoiling the experience a bit for myself. So Ive decided to try something new and avoid trailers, avoid podcasts, avoid articles, unfollow everything Game of Thrones related (except reddit since spoilers are actually hidden here). Does anyone else do this? Is this even possible?  
My hope is that every single frame of this season , every line and every plot point will be a fresh experience for me and therefore Ill be able to squeeze every last drop of enjoyment out of it.

1 Dany keeps saying Cercei will take half the country, she'll ""march in"" if Dany goes north or something. With what though? Starks, Tullys, Arryns, Baratheons, Martells and Tyrells all hate Lannisters and most of Lannisters died fighting Starks, Baratheons and last season many died against Tyrells and Dany.

837,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-8,2019,1,8,1,adjem3,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] My Season 8 Predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/adjem3/spoilers_my_season_8_predictions/,darrylthedudeWayne,1546879099,"So these are my predictions for Season 8, I worked really hard on this so....yeah. Anyways these are not my full predictions but basically a summary of what I want to happen and I hope you like them, enjoy.

-	First up I do believe the rest of the wall will be taken down. I know a lot of people dont think so but to be honest, I dont really think the Wall will really have a place in this world in the end as I dont think the White Walkers will even be a think by the end of this story, So I do think the rest of the wall needs to be destroyed. Perhaps maybe the NK needed to destroy Eastwatch so he could weaken the NK enough for him to take down the rest of the wall.
-	Now that I got that out of the way, I can get into the rest of my predictions which starts with Reunions. I wont list all of them because that would take forever but I do think we are going to get lots of reunions next season and the three I am most looking forward too are Jaime/Bran, Arya/Jon, and Arya/Gendry. The and Arya Gendry one I will go more into when I get too my predictions for Arya and Gendry but Jaime/Bran I think will be interesting to see since Jaime is going to feel a lot of guilt for what he did in the past but I feel Bran will forgive him seeing the true reason why he killed the Mad King that faithful day. In fact I believe Jaime will actually die up North saving both Bran and one of the stark sisters, which would also bring his arc full circle in my opinion. As for Arya/Jon I think we will seem them bond and may even be team and share a lot of scenes together but I dont think there will be no conflict, I do believe Arya will have some problems once she finds out Jon gave up the Northern kingship and is getting help from Cersei.
-	For Dany I believe she will play a part in the endgame helping command the armies and her dragons, I believe Dany will give birth to twins and will survive childbirth, but will die with Drogon at the hands of the NK and Viserion in Dance of the Dragons 2.0. I dont see her becoming queen at this point in the story but more on why later.
-	Jon will learn the truth and I see him surviving to the end but I dont think he will want to be king, I believe he is actually Lightbringer with his father Rhaegar being the Prince that Was Promised/Azor Ahai Reborn, and he will be the one to defeat the NK with some help of course, and in the end he will want to return home and rule and live in the North, raising his twin children. Oh and I believe he will lose Ghost and his sword Longclaw will be destroyed by the NK.
-	The Stark children will have a role to play in the endgame with the exception of Sansa, whom personally I dont know what else she can do now that the politics portion of the show is done. I personally believe she will probably have a problem with Dany and I believe when a surprise attack on WF led by Euron and the Golden Company during the first battle against the WWs (and yes I do think that will happen) she along with Jon may be taken hostage to KL, the reason I believe this because she cant fight and the Political stuff with GOT is pretty much done at this point sadly. I also believe (paralleling Lady and Nymeria) she will die saving Arya, Bran will have a crucial role to play. Revealing Jon his true parentage, Discovering the true intentions of the White Walkers and why they have returned now, who the NK really is, and of course how to defeat him. We could also see some more flashbacks like another Mad King flashback, Bran the builder flashback, Rhaegar vs Robert flashback, etc. Though I dont think he is the NK nor do I think he was responsible for the Mad Kings madness. But he may have gave Bran the builder the idea too build the Wall, Anyways I feel he may leave beyond the former Wall after all is said and done to be the new 3ER. And finally for Arya after three seasons of not so great storytelling for her this season she needs to have the best plotline yet. Especially since she has been setup through the series for her. I believe she will kill a white walker or two with Catspaw and will save people of both WF and KL. I believe her arc this season will be about fully regaining her humanity and re-socialization and I believe she will be the one who ultimately kills Cersei. Afterwards while it would be cool for her to sail west of Westeros I personally feel she will marry Gendry and they will rule the Seven Kingdoms together.
-	Speaking of Which Gendry I think will forge weapons to help fight the white walkers and when all is said and done may reforge ICE, but I dont think that is the only reason he was brought back, I think he was also brought back for Aryas arc as I feel the two will start a romance in Season 8, I read somewhere on another prediction that it could provide some humor as Arya wouldnt know what to do as she has never known that type of love before and I agree.
-	Cersei after her miscarriage will grow more mad and paranoid, and will send Euron and Golden Company to WF to surprise attack it. Her paranoia will get the better of her as with Qyburns help she will make a pact with the white Walkers becoming the Night Queen. Then of course Arya will kill her. Qyburn will survive and flee to Essos never to be heard from again, and of course CLEGANEBOWL. Sandor wins and kills his brother but either dies from his wounds or Arya gives him the gift of Mercy.
-	House Greyjoy I feel will go extinct. Damphair will die on Pyke in theons arms, Theon will die killing Euron after saving Yara, and Yara will die at KL.
-	Tyrion and Varys will be revealed to be traitors as Tyrion had betrayed Dany not only out of jealously over her and Jon but also for Cerseis unborn child, Promising that the child would live and would be heir to the Throne and marry J&amp;Ds child when they come of age, and he help plan the surprise attack on WF and set KL aflame with Wildfire killing innocent citizens as well as Bronn, Yara, Harry Strickland (yes Golden Company does change sides), Jorah, Howland Reed (if he even reappears), Septa Unella, and Grey Worm (if he survives the first battle up North) with Varys helping him. Varys is killed by his own Little Birds while Tyrion is either exiled to Essos with his tongue cut out or he is executed but is revealed to have faked his death via switching himself out with a FM and sails off to Summer Isles while drinking Imps Delight. Also yes he finishes that Joke.
-	The NK and White Walkers motivations will be revealed and that the NK is NOT actually the first White Walker like we all think he is and the bearded NK in the cave drawings is not the same NK we see in the present on the show (as for who he really is though idk yet, Maybe he is the 13th Lord Commander/The Nights King of Legend or maybe he is one of the other many Brandons in history or maybe he is just some random guy who has no ties to the houses in the story or even magic that was just simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, I havent decided yet). As for his and the WWs motivations? Well I believe it is a combination of wanting to end the curse the children put on them, Resurgence in magic, and them being threatened by the Lord of Light and the burning of the Weirwoods. I think NKs fall will be a team effort. Jon fighting 1v1 with him, Bran playing a game of minds with NK and pulling a Hold the Door 2.0 to weaken him, and Sam removing the Dragonglass from his chest which will result in him dying a mortal man, all the Wights collapsing, the White Walkers turning back to human form, the seasons going back into order, and yeah.
-	The Iron throne will be melted down and a constitutional monarchy is established in its place with hints of a Proto-Democratic Government/republic in the near future. Each kingdom will also be divided with each having its own constitutional Monarchy. A likeable Sand Snake ruling Dorne, Sam ruling the Reach, Robin ruling the Vale, New Houses ruling the Stormlands, Pyke, and the Westerlands, Rolsin ruling the Riverlands until her and Edmures child comes of age, Jon ruling the North, and Arya and Gendry ruling the Crownlands. There will also be a lot of refugees, rebuilding, and changes in the system like marriages being out of love and woman being allowed to be a Maester or Kingsgaurd. Sam writes the Song of Ice and Fire.
-	The survivors are Jon, Bran, Davos, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, Tyrion, Arya, Gendry, Brienne, Nymeria and her Wolfpack, Hot Pie, Roslin and her child, Robin, Qyburn, Lyanna Mormont, J&amp;Ds twins, Missendei, Meera (we learn that she survived but she never appears in the season), and the remaining White Walkers after they turn back to human form.
-	The people who die are as follows: Edd, the Nights Watch, Ghost, Beric, Tormund, Pod, Grey Worm, All three Dragons, Yohn Royce, most of the Northern Lords, Most of the Dothraki and Unsullied, Edmure, Bronn, Theon, Yara, Damphair, Euron, Mel, The Mountain, Sandor, Jaime, Howland Reed, Harry Strickland, Septa Unella, Varys, Dany, Jorah, Sansa, Cersei, and the NK.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

3. Tyrion and Cersei discussing the future of House Lannister, Tyrion saying he never wanted to destroy his family, Cersei is pregnant ---possible implications could be Tyrion assuring Cersei that her baby will be next in the line of succession
4. Theon is stronger after having been forgiven by Jon Snow.

## ...King Aegon.

This scene will not play our as nicely as we were presented in the footage. If you havent seen, HBO released some quick snips of the next season, including a clip of Sansa apparently welcoming Dany with open arms. I dont think things will quite go that way.

First off, I am assuming that Sansa learns of Jons lineage before his return, which is a pretty big assumption.  My basis for this is that after 7 seasons, we know reliably that whenever it's very very important that a character keep something a secret, it almost never remains a secret.  Bran may tell Sansa himself, or Sam may let something slip, or Arya might be lurking around and overhear a conversation between Sam and Bran.  Regardless, Sansa is loyal to Jon. When she learns the truth, she will view Jon as the King of Westeros, not the King in the North, meaning Danaerys would not be afforded the title of your grace.

Plus, Sansa loves the rhetorical switch. This is the same technique she used when accusing Baelish of his crimes, while pretending to accuse Arya.  She'll look Dany in the eyes, they will smile at each other, and then at the last second she turns her head to Jon, acknowledging him as King Aegon.  

Now, I'm not saying that Sansa will be openly hostile to Dany, or ignore the fact that she has two massive dragons and is making googly eyes at Jon.  I just think that this scene in the trailer seemed a bit too neat, and the showrunners would love to add a little shade into the mix to add more stakes, drama, and comedy.  When she throws everyone off balance, she'll immediately follow up with a ""we have much to discuss"", and then they'll hammer things out in Winterfell.

I think they represent:

1. The Stark family
2. The seven kingdoms
3. Certain main characters in the story

**The Stark Family** 

The father: Ned Stark  
The mother: Catelyn Stark  
The maiden: Sansa   
The Crone: Bran  
The Warrior: Robb  
The Smith: Arya  
The Stranger: Rickon

&amp;#x200B;

**The Seven Kingdoms** (not as clear as with the Stark family, but totally open to interpretation!)

The father: The Crownlands  
The mother: The Reach  
The maiden: Dorne, since they are an independent kingdom in all but name.   
The Crone: Riverlands  
The Warrior: Casterly Rock/Westerlands  
The Smith: Iron islands   
The Stranger: The Vale, we see the least amount of involvement in the story 

&amp;#x200B;

**Characters in the show** (again, open to interpretation) 

The father: Jon Snow  
The mother: Margaery   
The maiden: Sansa   
The Crone: Bran/Four eyed raven  
The Warrior: Arya  
The Smith: Gendry  
The Stranger: Daenerys, since her storyline is more independent and unknown to those in Westeros.

&gt;""She had to leave now, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was too frightened to move.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Calm as still water,* a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but her, and the horses, and the dead men.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Quiet as a shadow,* she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio's? She could not tell, yet somehow it calmed her fears.

Anyone have any opinion on this? Never caught it before, because it seems like nothing...but knowing the series and GRRM's writing a little better, nothing...is nothing. ANyway.

We have already seen one example of that. Sansa says to Daenerys Winterfell is yours, your Grace, just as Ned did to Robert. Here are some other things from the first episode I think they could reference...

A cold open of the White Walkers attacking Last Hearth would be good, just like they attacked the Rangers at the very start of the series.

I think one of the Stark children could spot Daenerys coming from miles away and run to tell everyone else. It was Bran in the first episode, but he cant exactly run or climb anymore, so I think it will be Arya and I think the first thing shell spot will be the dragons flying in the distance. I think seeing that might bring a sense of childlike wonderment back into her life. That would be nice to see.

I think well see a crypt scene similar to when Ned and Robert visited Lyannas tomb in the first episode. That might be the moment Jon is told who his parents were. Maybe Sam and Bran take him down there to reveal it. Another thought is maybe Jon takes Daenerys down there to show him the tombs of his ancestors so she has a better understanding of Stark history. Maybe hell show her the tombs of Rickard, Brandon and Lyanna to remind her why the people of Winterfell arent exactly thrilled about her being there. They might even find something in Lyannas tomb that hints at Jons parentage, or the marriage between Lyanna and Rhaegar.

Jon might have to perform an execution as Ned did in the first episode. But that moment has already been paralleled when Jon executed Janos Slynt. And I dont know who he would execute. Maybe one of the Northern Lords disrespects Daenerys, refuses to bend the knee to her, and he has to prove his loyalty to her by executing him. 

Another big moment in that first episode, although it didnt happen in Winterfell, was Daenerys marrying Khal Drogo. Maybe we will see Jon marry Daenerys in the first episode of season 8 too. I expect there will be a lot of dissent in Winterfell regarding Daenerys being there and a lot of northmen may not be thrilled about fighting for her. One way to make them warm to the idea of a Stark/Targaryen alliance might be with a marriage. Officially wed their Houses together (even though Jon isnt legitimised as a Stark). The North would surely have to recognise that marrying the King in the North to a claimant for the throne is a big deal and would be a good thing for Winterfell and the North if she becomes Queen.

What else from the first episode do you think they could reference or mirror?",23,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, I strongly believe that Jon will not survive the upcoming war with the WWs. I feel like his arc will lead him to fight to the end to ensure his loved ones are safe. So I can't figure out if D&amp;D only made him legitimate to increase the potential conflict between him and Dany (since he'll not only be her nephew/lover, but the actual Targaryen heir, rather than her). Or because he'll actually survive and sit the Iron Throne by the end. Perhaps there's another reason I'm missing.

I will add that this post is largely speculative since I've based it on my belief that Jon's fate is to die fighting the WWs (and possibly killing the NK). I could be completely wrong.

I wonder what happens to them in the books and if GRRM will go in a similar direction. Let's see which Great Houses are *still alive*:

**House Arryn** - Robin Arryn Lord of the Eyrie is Lord Paramount of the Vale.
**House Lannister** - Queen Cersei is Lady of Casterly Rock and Lady Paramount of the Westerlands. It could be possible that she has bestowed both titles upon Jaime off-screen, as he is seen leading the Lannister armies.
**House Stark** - Jon Snow is Lord of Winterfell, and both Sansa Stark and Bran Stark endorse him, so I guess House Stark is ruling the region at this point.
**House Greyjoy** - King Euron Greyjoy rules the Iron Islands. Should he die unexpectedly, Yara can take over. But since the Iron Islands are an elective monarchy I am not sure if a Greyjoy ruling it or not is that important.

Now the *extinct or permanently deposed* Great Houses:

**House Tyrell** - Albeit we have seen Olenna with two relatively young Tyrell handmaidens, I think the showmakers (and the audience) consider them extinct.
**House Martell** - Extinct. Even if you consider the sand snakes as options.
**House Baratheon** - Extinct. Gendry cannot inherit unless he is legitimized, and even then it would be fishy, as Robert hasn't officially recognized him as his son in any capacity.
**House Tully** - Permanently deposed. Edmure's fate is unknown.

**House Bolton** - Extinct
**House Frey** - Extinct? Unsure here.

There are two moments (correct me if there are more Im forgetting) when the White Walkers seem to have a different motivation from simply killing all living people and raising them as wights - and they both demand this question.

First, in the first episode, when they let Will live. Second, in S2E10, when Sam hides behind the rock, and they let him live.

In letting the two live, the Walkers must intend for the two to go back south and warn people that the Walkers are building up their army. Strategically, though, this doesnt seem to make sense. The Walkers can kill and raise anyone who doesnt kill them with Valyrian steel/dragon glass first. What could they possibly gain from sending such a warning? The only thing I can think of is that the Night King has some form of site - whether its as powerful, less or more than Brans - and that he knew the only way to break through the wall and bring the whole army south more quickly was with a raised dragon, and he let Will and Sam live to start the entire plot and keep it moving towards Jon and Danys alliance, to bring her dragons to him. Clearly, if this isnt the case, hed have needed some unknown other method of transporting his army of hundreds of thousands past the wall, and, once they had passed, the element of surprise would have made their victory inevitable. 

Im not a big fan of the Bran-is-the-Night King theory, or anything similar, and also kinda wish the NK didnt even possess and site. Just generally frustrated at how utterly nonexistent a set of motivation is for our principle villains and Ill be supremely disappointed if the Walkers end up amounting to some metaphorical antagonist or some background problem with the real threat being mankinds problems or some such generic nonsense...

&amp;#x200B;

We don't know anything about **Lands of Always Winter**, except Night King has a ""domain"" there.

Which in turn means that we don't know what's there. Other than the Arrowhead Mountain

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons: 

\- Night King... Night **KING:** King of the Seven Kingdoms, King in the North, King Beyond the Wall. All the kings. All have their ""own"" kingdom which they rule in. Night King is named as king that for a reason, because he is a king. King of the dead, King of the Lands of Always Winter.

For fuck sakes, he even has a crown.

&amp;#x200B;

Also NK (and all the Walkers) has their own house. NK's sigil being either that brooch or the fabulous corpse symbol.

I mean Bolton's have a flayed man as their sigil and they present flayed men on crosses in battlefields, just like their sigil shows.

https://i.redd.it/86e8j009p7921.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

\- White Walkers: White Walkers are created by the Night King, just as knights are knighted by a king and some receive a lordship with a castle to rule in (Littlefinger and Harrenhaal for example). White Walkers are just that, lords of houses.  All being loyal to the King who ""knighted"" them. Just as houses in the south have pledged their swords to either kings or other higher lords.

[The altar in the Land of Always Winter](https://i.redd.it/w3dxtxk5r7921.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Army of the Dead: recruits. Nobodies who were (in a bit unorthodox methods) ""recruited"" into the ranks.

We've seen White Walkers control their own troops, including when they raided in the beyond the Wall for a wight.

Killing the Walker led to his troops (except the one, who wasn't his soldier) dying. Symbolical to when you kill a lord, the other houses are broken and without a leader. Obviously, the only difference is that they have a magical bond that keeps them alive through the Walker who resurrected them. All serving in Night King's ranks, serving Walkers as their Lords and generals.

I.e. Wights are just soldiers for a certain house.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what I'm about to say is far fetched with no evidence:

Yes, Walkers were defeated in the past.

They laid dormant for a thousand years.

They ""woke up"" after the Game of Thrones began.

Night King of House Dead is just a player in the game of thrones, they just don't want to ""kill every single living thing"". He merely wants the Throne, with any means necessary, just like any other player.

He still has the blood of the First Men in his veins, he might even have a claim to the throne.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware of the the writer/director or so saying something in the line of him just being a force of chaos. But does it mean they are honest? Talk about plot twist.

&gt;This war has just begun.  It will last for years.  Thousands will die at your command.  You will betray the men serving you.  You will betray your family, and you will betray everything you once held dear, and it will all be worth it because you are the son of fire.  You are the warrior of blood.  You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.  You will be king.

&amp;#x200B;

Melly is referring to the War for the Iron Throne that Stannis is engaged in.

&amp;#x200B;

But frame it through the lens of Jon fighting the war against the Great Other / Night King.  That war started with the resurgence of the NK and his army around the start of the series or just before it which caused Mance to unite the North.  The war is obviously stretching on for years.  Thousands have died at Jon's command:  The Wildlings during the Battle at the Wall, the people that died at Hardhome, and the casualties of the Battle of the Bastards, not to mention the forthcoming deaths.

Jon betrayed the men who appointed him king, and betrayed his family, and the Night's Watch, and the North by swearing allegiance to Dany.

And this will be worth it for him because this brought Dany, the Unsullied, the Dothraki, and those 2 little dragons onto his side.  And he needs them - the dragons especially - to win and save Westeros.

Now sweeping aside the pretenders I had trouble with.  But he did defeat Ramsay - who was the pretender-Lord of Winterfell.  Perhaps Dany will fall under this category (as Jon is the true heir to the IT, not Dany, and not Gendry, and not Cersei).  Perhaps Sansa (""Winterfell is yours, your Grace.""  (Jon was back in WF, thus WF was not Sansa's to give at that point, but Jon's.  (Unless she was speaking to Jon))).  He did cast aside Ser Allister who was the unappointed Lord Commander when Jon went to negotiate with Mance.

But the one part that made me think these were words meant for Jon, not Stannis, was ""son of fire... warrior of blood.""  Fire and blood.  Targaryen words.  And Jon's a Targ.",43,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1018,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-9,2019,1,9,3,adx28e,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS]: Jaime's Hypocrisy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/adx28e/spoilers_jaimes_hypocrisy/,FierceDeity88,1546970938,"In A Storm of Swords and A Feast For Crows, one of the best character arcs is Jaime's. I truly loved how he went from a haughty prick to a more contrite and self-aware person that actually cared about resolving conflicts peacefully, and broke away fully from Cersei by the end of the fourth book: tossing her plea for help in the fire and abandoning her utterly after observing her instability in person (and drawing parallels to Aerys) and realizing that she didn't love him. Additional (and welcome) glimpses into his personality were his relationships with Loras, Ilyn Payne, and his aunt Genna, and Lancel. Also he didn't actually murder a member of his family to break out of jail.

&amp;#x200B;

GOT Jaime appeared to generally follow the same character development up until the fourth season, where his entire arc was noticeably undermined by the arguable rape scene (that was consensual in the books) with Cersei. Additional problems included him not telling Tyrion that his first wife genuinely loved him and was not a whore, after which Tyrion falsely confesses to killing Joffrey and tells him of Cersei's infidelity. For the rest of the series, however, Jaime is consistently cowed by his sister, always supporting her, never questioning her or getting frustrated with her, until finally the ""bad writing"" floodgates opened fully in season 7 where he continues to support her despite her blowing up the Sept and killing members of their family either directly or indirectly. Not only does he never call her out for these crimes, it takes something she does that's completely unrelated for him to finally leave...with no solid plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Even in the show it made no sense for Jaime to continue supporting her based on what he did to Aerys: slitting his throat before the Mad King burned all of King's Landing and the half a million people in it. He was never even called out for this, and even got offended when Olenna tried to convince him that he was wrong to support her.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

She knows she's the last of her house and can not have a child. Yet, she declares war, invades Westeros with foreign armies (and dragons who will live long after her death) and declares herself queen while she will not be able to continue her lineage and her vision of the world. Moreover, we see her refusing to discuss succession for the moment. But she is at war and anything can happen. If she dies, everyone who follows and relies on her will end up with nothing. Not to appoint a successor or even to start talking about it is selfish.

I wonder if, rather than insisting so heavily on her infertile to announce a baby (which would surely be the most stupid spoil in history), this insistence is to show us that what she wants to establish will only lead nowhere after her death. And that there is a concern if she brings dragons to Westeros but no one will be able to ""control"" them after her death and her reign will die with her.",26,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I had no idea back when I first watched it, but I am insanely impressed with how Margaery handled Joffrey. In a swift moment, she was able to gain his favor in ways no other person in the entire Kingdom was able to achieve. 

She came into the room at first and it was just small talk. But then it became talk about her being married to a traitor (Renly), and it became another one of Joffrey's shame-guilting grilling sessions. It took her a couple sentences to get used to Joffrey's ""monstrosity,"" but she fucking nailed it. 

Renly was gay, we all knew that, and that's why he couldn't have kids with her. But she lied. God damn it she lied and it seemed like the truth, that's why I never caught on in my first watch. She told Joffrey that Renly's reason was that he suggested torturous and painful things in bed. 

DAMN. What an incredibly fantastic decision. She used that single half-sentence to completely deter Joffrey from doing the same to her. We all know Joffrey's fetish is extreme pain and torture. But now, she suggested that Renly was the same way, and Joffrey didn't want to be anything like a traitor. She knew that he would completely back away from the idea once he realized that he would be the same as a traitor. 

And so he did, he even lied and said that he was going to outlaw the idea of torture in bed (which we knew was complete bullshit because he loves that stuff). 

And then she treated him like a normal spoiled brat and made him feel like he was some superhuman god for knowing how to load a crossbow and shoot it (though with impressive aim, admittedly). *But then* she fakes being similar to Joffrey, in that she toyed with his fetish and made it shared between the couple rather than on his own. 

It's then Joffrey gathered the idea of becoming some kind of torturous sexual couple with Margaery as husband and wife. And that would put her in an entirely safe spot, making her the one person that he would never harm. 

Bravo Margaery. Bravo. Holy shit. I don't remember what happens with Joffrey and Margaery's relationship between now and the wedding but I sure damn well hope it continues to showcase her smart manipulation abilities.",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So neither Cersei, Dany nor Jon will sit on that throne in the end because they have all had to make their position as rightful ruler known to others.

And then he's in the next episode for a hot second, running at an inhuman speed back to Eastwatch, and then that's the last we hear of him. For all we know he's still at the Wall.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, it is never made known to major characters like Daenerys or Tyrion that he's Robert's bastard. While I might be ignorant of Westerosi politics and this might sound like a stupid idea, I think it's unfortunate that the potential for him to serve as a figurehead to gain the Stormlords' support for Daenerys is never even considered, especially since most of her allies are rapidly (and ridiculously) eliminated in one episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whether or not this would actually work, I think this would tie up/cleverly explain several problems with season 7:

1. GIVE BRIENNE SOMETHING TO DO: instead of her just going somewhere and nothing happening to her or Podrick or her being unimportant to the story, she, as the heir of House Tarth, could go with Gendry (and maybe Davos too since he's from there) and convince her father and other Stormlords to support Gendry's claim as Lord Paramount of the Stormlands since all other members of House Baratheon are dead. Again, whether or not this would work, the other lords would know Gendry as Robert's bastard because of how he looks and his warrior skills. He would also have powerful relatives through Robert that might support him. This could also give us a great opportunity to see Brienne develop her relationship with her father and perhaps even gain some respect from her fellow countrymen.

2. TYRION NOT BUYING CERSEI'S BULLSHIT: Instead of him once again being duped by Cersei in the memorable but pointless conversation they had in the season finale, we discover that he didn't believe her for a second that she was going to help them defeat the Night King, and had some plan to bolster support for Daenerys among the Great Houses while she moved her dragons and army North.

&amp;#x200B;

3. THE GOLDEN COMPANY: As we discover, Cersei has used the gold stolen from House Tyrell to hire the Golden Company from across the sea to retake the lands Daenerys (apparently) conquered. With the Stormlands supporting Daenerys, they would stand against the Company and again, give Gendry and Brienne an opportunity to win the love and support of their fellow countrymen. And, finally, we could get to see Storm's End, which the Golden Company besieges by the end of A Dance of Dragons (book 5).

&amp;#x200B;

My names Nick Bestor, Im a grad student at the University of Texas at Austin, and Im working on my dissertation on licensed games and the ways that they expand and sustain popular storyworlds. The project was partially inspired by my love of Fantasy Flights card games, and I intend to write one of my chapters on players/fans of games based on A Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire. I did some recruitment for this project over the summer on the Facebook group for the Card Game, but Im hoping to reach more players by posting in other locations.

Im looking for fans/played who might be interested in being interviewed by me about their experiences with A Game of Throne. I would be asking some hopefully fun questions about how you first got into the franchise, what you like or dislike about the storyworld of Westeros, and how games based in Martins storyworld have added to your understanding or appreciation of the series. 

These interviews will be accessible only to me, and you can choose to remain anonymous. These will only ever be used for my personal academic writing, and no personal information will ever be shared or sold. Id like to conduct these conversations online, through email, Facebook messenger, or any other platform you might prefer.

If you might be interested in being interviewed, email me at licensedstoryworlds@gmail.com. Ill send you some additional information at that time, including a consent form.

Diseases, stroke, etc. Other than him we don't hear of a condition that causes madness to be common amongst Targaryens.

So this got me thinking. I am not a geneticist but I under stand the basics as to why in-breeding is bad.

The basic idea is that negative recessive traits within the DNA have a more likely chance of presenting themselves if both parents have the same gene. This is not restricted to in-breeding though at all. For instance a friend of mine nearly died of a liver condition that was only possible for him to have a chance unless both of his parents carried the gene for it. His parents did not inbreed that just both happened to have the gene. 

But lets say he decided to marry his sister (who did not develop the condition, but still carries the gene). Any off spring they would have would have a chance for this to show up. If this practice was continued for generations all of their descendants would have this gene, and due to the continued inbreeding by people carry this recessive gene would become more prominent and the liver condition would be more and more prevalent and possibly severe. 

Now to my original point we don't see to see the Targaryens having any negative recessive genes. They have recessive genes, the Silver hair, possibly the dragon blood, etc. But those are good. If the recessive genes that can cause things like Clubbed feet, deformed jaw, dwarfism, hemophilia are simply non-existant than I don't see how inbreeding could be dangerous for them. It is dangerous for us because almost every person alive carries DNA that if inbreed over time would present conditions that would now. In essence we try to water down our DNA as much as possible to lower the probability of defects. There are recessive traits we like (hair, eye colors) and so we don't avoid having kids with people that have the traits we like. 

Or it could just because that is how GRRM wrote them, but any geneticist or biologist is welcome to correct me and explain why inbreeding would always lead to issues over time. (I already acknowledge it would be impossible real world, so no, I am no advocating for it)",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I thought about it and finally pinned down why.

In my mind he was the last hope to extend the line of Starks. Unless Bran gets less weird and decides to get a girl (not looking likely) Rickon was it. It sucked when Ned died, but you saw his legacy and his house would live on through Robb, Rickon, or Bran (who was just crippled, and not weird at that point). Robb was posturing himself to be a strong leader for a long time. Then he was killed. Bran decided to get weird, and I really thought they would keep Rickon around to be a future leader of house Stark.

So it was not Rickon himself, but it was the finality I felt when he died. And obviously how close he was to finally getting back to his family added to it too.

Dany has no rule over House Stark and Jons pledge to the Mother of Dragons is technically nullified, seeing as he is first in line to rule. Sansa has no desire to see Dany rule Winterfell.

None of this matters, because the Army of the dead will likely destroy most of them (probably not Bear Island. Lyanna Mormont is too much of a badass). ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have read many theories on most of the items listed below, usually arguing they must be a ""Chekhov's Gun"" - placed there conspicuously by the author because they must have a significant meaning in the end. But, my theory, is that some/many of these were placed specifically as Red Herrings, to distract readers/viewers from the truth/actual significant items.

So, which of the following are Chekhov's Guns, and which are Red Herrings...?

A partial list - feel free to add to it: (some of these are obviously important, but it's not clear how/why, while others are more ambiguous whether they matter at all, or were actually intended to misdirect/distract) 

\- ""Legitimate"" Birth Rights - the R+L=J theory, fAegon, secret Targaryens, Gendry's King's Blood, etc. 

\- Prophecies - Dany's Mirri Maz Dur prophecy, Cersei's Maggie the Frog, the Last Hero/Prince Who Was Promised, etc.

\- Dreams - mostly the Wolf dreams for Bran, Arya and Jon Snow come to mind here... but there are other examples

\- Religions (related to the prophecies) there are several major religions, many with similar origin/creation stories - is one ""right""? Do they all contain shreds of truth from the past?

\- Valyrian Steel Weapons (Most ""major"" characters with fighting skills wield them... related to the Last Hero prophecy)

\- Black Oily Stone/Glass Candles - numerous items around the world are ancient and made of the same material, and the candles appear throughout the world as well, said to allow communication between red priests, or something... these are mostly featured in the books, but must have some explanation)

\- Horns - again, more prominent in the books, but one was in the bundle Sam discovered with the dragon glass weapons

\- Very Old Books - ""I read about it in a very old book"" - Samwell Tarly

\- Gargoyles - seen on three prominent locations and dating back to ancient, mysterious times - seen on the Winterfell Crypts, Dragonstone, and the Wall (I think...)

\- Iron Bank of Braavos/Lannister Debts - my personal favorite candidate for playing the role of Chekhov's gun... ",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Weiss was talking about Daenerys and her dragons. He comments on her dilemma putting the dragons beneath the pyramid. While talking about this subject he said, ""it is the only children she will ever know"".

I found it interesting that he said ""IS the only"" and not ""may be the only"" or ""could be the only"". It made me wondering if him and Benioff already knew the direction they were taking to the end at this point. So, are they going to have Daenerys get pregnant, as my here and elsewhere suggest, or is the whole Jon and Daenerys pregnancy possibility another red herring of sorts. 

I was wondering if anyone else caught Weiss' comment and though it possibly telling of D&amp;D's intentions for the ending of the series and of Daenerys' potential pregnancy?

Especially since everything has boiled down to 6 obvious main hero type characters at this point. (Ayra, Bran, Sansa, Dany, Jon, Tyrion). I use Gendry as the 7th but nothing's for sure, and there's still a lot that could change in the last season. This catches my attention because there's no coincidence in ASOIAF, tons of symbolism and Easter eggs, plus I'm bored.

This is my rationale but there's many things I haven't considered, I've seen all the episodes but I'm only half through the second book as of now, and the devil is in the details, so I'm looking forward to any and all input.
(Copied the descriptions from game of thrones wiki)



The Father:represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead.

Tyrion. Not so sure.  His calling in life I'm is to make decisions for the kindgom, he speaks to that during his time as Hand of the King to Joff, and when he steps in he clears out the people who were disloyal as best as he could, no matter where their allegiance lies. He is loyal to the realm, not to his family or his self interest besides being alive. I also believe he has a much bigger part to play than most expect. I think he's a Targaryen and one of the heads of the dragon, so it makes sense to me that he would also be father. 

The Mother:represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as ""the strength of women"".

Daenarys for sure., barren, but still birthed a baby even if it was dead. Perhaps because she is mother to all rather than to her own children The strength part is obvious. And her being called mother is everywhere. My favorite argument for this is Danys attachment to the Dothraki, and a lot of her major plot points that have motherhood themes take place in Vaes Dothrak, which is in the shadow of the Mother of Mountains. This is where she is predicted to give birth to the stallion who mounts the world, and where she later burns all the other Khals, essentially uniting them into one Khalasar. The parallels are suggestive and GRRM is all about details.

The Maiden:represents purity, innocence, love, and beauty.

Sansa for sure. She's innocent, was focused on love from the beginning with Joff, and has had 2 marriages. Also very beautiful. As far as purity the only slight I've seen her make was to Arya when she didn't tell the truth of what happened with Joffrey on the kingsroad.

The Crone:represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern.

Bran for sure, as a greenseer it's obvious. But what convinced me was his relationship to Old Nan, who could not be more of a crone, and she ties in even more as Hodors family member. And Hodor is a big part of Brans character arch obviously.

However there is no denying that an old woman with foresight who has a lantern points to the red priests. Which kinda throws this whole idea for a loop but still.


The Warrior:represents strength and courage in battle

Jon for sure, He's sorta always fighting someone. I am also certain he will lead the actual battle against the white walkers and their army.

The Smith:represents creation and craftsmanship.

 Gendry, not so sure he's sort of a sideliner, and it's almost too literal since he's an apprentice Smith and all but I do think his reappearance is no coincidence at this late in the game. I'll have to see where the show takes him though to be sure of his fit in this role.

The Stranger:The Stranger represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to.

Arya. This is pretty outright as well. Arya was almost an official faceless man, who are worshippers of the god of death. The unknown aspect is that she was no one, and using faces as a disguise. When she first starts naming people at night, in the books GRRM says it's like a prayer to her.

Jaime tells Joffrey he still has time to fill the pages. 

This season, Jaime will KILL the Night King,

He will go down in history as the King Slaying savior instead the Mad King Slaying betrayer. 

Thus cementing his place as the King Slayer; hero of Westeros.

In a way, he's also Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion's cousin since Dany is the Mother of Dragons and considers them as her children.

What I never really thought about is how Dany is actually Robb, Sansa, Arya and Bran and Rickon's aunt-in-law. Rhaegal would have been their uncle-in-law, and Rhaenys and Aegon would have been their cousins-in-law. In a sense, the Stark kids are also cousins-in-law to Dany's dragons. 

Then I thought about Ned in S1 and how he opposed Robert's plan of assassinating Dany. I don't know if Lyanna told him that she and Rhaegal got married. But whether he knew it or not, Ned was protecting his sister-in-law (Dany) and his unborn nephew-in-law (Rhaego). Had he lived, Rhaego would have also been Jon's only Targaryen cousin.

Finally, it dawned on me that Aerys was responsible for killing his grandson's (Jon) other grandfather (Rickard) and uncle (Brandon). The two Starks are also Rhaegar's father-in-law and brother-in-law, respectively. So Aerys killed his in-laws without realising it.

Then there's Jon sort of familial connection to the Martells, through Rhaenys and Aegon, his half-siblings. Also, to the Baratheons, as a distant cousin due to their shared Targaryen heritage. But I'll stop here. 

Anyways, this post isn't anything new or ground-breaking. I'm sure every house in Westeros is related somehow. But I found it intriguing to think about these particular Stark &amp; Targaryen connections and attach labels to the characters' relationships.

Or [read the web-page on my site](https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/JorahAndJon.html), screenshots included. I believe the video released at the Emmys confirm the key role of Jorah in the fate of Jon and Daenerys. Pic. Notice the triangle: D, J, and J. Eyes of Daenerys and, more importantly, Jorah are on Jon. The motion confirms that the two are moving towards Jon, the logical dynamics is between the three. 

In later scenes we see more of a welcome to Winterfell development: Sansa and Jon interacting with Daenerys. But the very first scene was focused on Jorah. Well, Dany is obviously the center, but notice that they positioned the camera to specifically include Jorah. When is it happening? Following history with Season 6, most of the teased scenes should play themselves out in the first two episodes. Clearly, we deal with arrival of Daenerys and her entourage to Winterfell. It must be early in Episode 1. Ill discuss two possible developments, but first outline the principles I base them on. I have no knowledge or inside information on S8. I rely only on the elements that the show itself highlights  clearly a subjective call. Role of Jorah for Daenerys and Jon seems to be strongly promoted, but not in an exaggerated way to make it a misdirection. 

Here are briefly some events in the past that might be foreshadowing Jorahs actions against Jon. 

* Obsession with Daenerys. Jorah is positioned as obsessive about his love interest  see his first marriage. He is passionate to the point of jealousy. Remember Tyrions words:

&gt;He would kill for you.

Funny little things that Martin, I suspect, loves to use to set up major events. Remember:

&gt;Tell the old man that he smells of pee.

How is it significant? In the books, Daenerys is told to:

* Beware of the perfumed seneschal.

Who could be the seneschal? Plenty of candidates were suggested, Varys, in particular. The question Id ask, though, why is the seneschal perfumed? For Jorah, I could provide a reason  because he doesnt want to smell of pee. The remark, made in Daenerys presence, hurt him. This way it is not just some random trait or occurrence  oh, a seneschal would just randomly have some perfume on him. This way it is crucially connected with the reason *why* the seneschal is to be feared. Jorah is obsessed with Daenerys, doesnt want to accept the obvious (young people love young people and in case of Targaryens  Targaryens). The perfume is an indication of that deeper problem, the obsession, and precursor to more radical actions. 

Does Jorah even fit the definition of seneschal? Notice that literally the word translates: the oldest servant. Remember how Jorah was called the old man, in the same sentence that also mentioned his smell. Definition: *an officer having full charge of domestic arrangements, ceremonies, the administration of justice, etc., in the household of a medieval prince or dignitary; steward*. One of the duties of a seneschal is to announce the dignitary. The way Gray Worm announces Daenerys when Jon arrives on Dragonstone:

* Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, etc. etc. 

But because Gray Worm is travelling on foot, this duty would fall on Jorah. Please re-watch the scenes from the teaser, as brief as they are, and perhaps you would agree that in them Jorah is announcing or just announced Daeneryss title. Also note his kind-of-ceremonial clothes. I understand it is cold and everything, but the contrast with his usual clothing is sharp. 

By the way, Gray Worm as the seneschal (the way he is portrayed in S7 on Dragonstone) also doesnt bring anything good for Daenerys (see below). And now these are the two options:

## Revive Jon at all cost

The option I was promoting recently. In this scenario here is the sequence:

* Jorah attacks Jon out of jealousy;
* I suspect Longclaw (the sword) has a role to play in the fight, at least in the books (because Germanic myths and legends)
* Jon is dead or wounded, but everybody keeps telling Daenerys that the realm needs a heir
* Daenerys decides (rationally, you might argue) to follow the path she tried before: put the living and the dead, good or bad, on the pyre and hope that Jon would be reborn. Melisandre might be back by that time and provide further instructions.
* To make sure things work a victim is to be added to the pyre and Missandei happens to be it. As normal fire is probably not magical enough, a dragon must breathe on it. 
* Gray Worm learns about it and kills Drogo the dragon (or another dragon?). 
* Daenerys finds herself without a husband and child-less (no dragons).

&gt;What life is worth when everything else is taken away?

Ill speculate on Daenerys actions somewhere else, but they wouldnt be pleasant. The world must burn  basically, that will be her attitude. 

I like this approach because of how tightly the events logically fit, follow from each other. If you dont like this theory, see if you can answer the following questions:

Why Gray Worm is compared to the boy who knew no fear? My answer is: Siegfried story from Wagners Ring cycle. If you believe it is a misdirection How many viewers would realistically pick up on that link with Siegfried? Gray Worm does kill a dragon (as did Siegfried), but not Drogo, suppose he kills the Undead Viserys. Then why this connection with Missandei? Why tell her: 

* You are my weakness. 

My explanation is: think what Gray Worm do to protect Missandei? He wouldnt betray for himself  but when Missandei is involved 

## Scenario 2.

Jon is indisposed, as in Scenario 1. But instead of reviving Jons body, could Dany consider a marriage offer from Euron? After all, both in the books and on the show, Euron has plans to marry Daenerys. This is a rather ugly possibility and I wont discuss it, at least not here. 

\_\_\_\_\_

Instead, I would rather discuss other developments that the confirmation of Jon and Daenerys at Winterfell might hint at. 

Facts: Beginning of S8  Dany and Jon are together at Winterfell. Sometimes in S8  Dany is in the Red Keep, Kings Landing. See her visions in the House of the Undying. Is Jon with her? No. A) The visions dont hint at anybody dear to her in that room, B) the meaning of the vision. It is a choice: choose the Iron Throne or love (husband and child)  at least thats one way to interpret it. If Jon is anywhere present near Daenerys making this choice, there is no competition. Jon doesnt need the IT. Jon wouldnt want Daenerys to have anything to do with the IT. Hence, Jon is not in Kings Landing when Daenerys is contemplating the Iron Throne. 

How do they get separated and why? Lets start with a simple binary choice: Do they separate because they chose to or due to circumstances beyond their control? I would argue the latter. I dont see a scenario where it makes logical sense for Daenerys and Jon to split. The assumption of S7 is that the good guys keep together: deal with the threat from the North, then settle the issue of ruling Westeros. Both the good guys and Cersei assume that and base their plans on that. 

What legitimate reasons could force Dany and Jon to split? Suppose that they hear about Cerseis betrayal. Suppose they hear Euron comes with the Golden Company to KL. And what? They decide to send half of their forces south to deal with the traitors (Euron and Cersei)? Their previous philosophy was  let us unite, only joined forces would have a chance against NK. And then they decide to halve their force? No. Jaime knows about Cerseis betrayal and he still, logically, assumes that the good guys will be in the North with their full force (see last episode, S7). 

Is it possible that the good guys army is together but only the commanders split? Dothraki and the Unsullied  I cant see them suddenly coming to Jons command as opposed to Daenerys. Is Jon expelled from the good guys army somehow? No, I dont see this happening. 

The only remaining possibility is that Daenerys goes back south because *she has to* and Jon is not with her *because he cant be with her*. It would be very strange for Daenerys to leave Jon behind  I argue. You may say: she has done it already beyond the Wall. Well, ultimately, I am going to propose that she does leave him behind (because there is nothing she can do for him, she thinks). So that possibility would only prove my ultimate proposition. She wouldnt leave Jon alive or lightly-wounded behind. Not after they became lovers. So, by the time Daenerys flees from Winterfell, Jon must be dead or mortally-wounded. How? 

You may say he heroically fights the Army of the Dead and is wounded. I dont think so. Jorah attacks Jon. Does it happen at Winterfell or on Dragonstone? I thought for a long time that it would be at Dragonstone and at the very end of the story, when the Army of the Dead is dealt with. (And it was creating logical issues.)  I suspect now that it might happen at Winterfell as there are numerous factors that could provoke the action. There is the little bear, the lady of Bear Islands. How will she react to Jorah? There is Sam. His reaction to Jorahs actions could be very meaningful as he fought with Jorahs father and saved Jorah himself. To postpone that to DS would require Jon, Sam, and Jorah to be there  unlikely and probably unnecessary. 

An obvious character of significance in Jorahs story is Lyanna Mormont. If Jorah kills Jon and needs to be executed, I could see Lyanna doing it, although personally I dont believe in or favor this development. Some interactions involving Lyanna definitely should happen:

* Daenerys introduced Jorah as of Bear Island. But now Lyanna is the Lady of Bear Island. 
* Eddard Stark exiled Jorah and stripped him of his land. Suppose the issue arises: should Jorah be restored? Daenerys would favor Jorah. Sansa, I suspect, would be strongly against it. What would Jon do? 
* Jon might quote Jorahs father saying: I have no son. (Which might deepen Jorahs hatred for Jon.) Jon would be in a difficult situation: on the one hand he loves Daenerys and accepted her as his queen. On the other hand, Lyanna Stark helped the North  how is it fair to pass the lordship to Jorah? But then again Jorah was his comrade in their expedition beyond the Wall. 
* Jon will either rule against Jorah  and thus cement Jorahs decision to kill him. Or
* The show might use an easy way out  before Jon has a chance to decide, Jorah attacks him. 

One thing is certain: the show needs Lyanna Mormont for some purpose. It must be related to Jorah. And it will play out in the North, apparently in Winterfell. 

Why Sam is needed? To show the books main point (one of): there is a price to pay for good actions. Sams thoughts: I saved this guy and now he killed my best friend  did I do the right thing? 

Well, that settles my mind at least. It is unlikely the show will drag ALL those characters south (Lyanna and Sam and Daenerys and Jorah and Jon). Sam is very meaningful character to provide a perspective on Jon-Jorah showdown. Lyanna  makes sense for her plot-wise to be around as well. They are together now  it is unlikely the show will set up a meeting for them all sometime later, somewhere else. Prediction: Jorah attacks Jon in Winterfell. 

## Logical possibilities for the Battle at Winterfell: Not that obvious

That would also help to resolve a major plot incongruency I was struggling with. There is going to be a major battle around or at Winterfell. Early in the season obviously. We know that. But how is it going to be resolved? Suppose the good guys win  then what else there to do? They win  why dont they kill the bad guys right there? Especially if the bad guys is essentially just one: the Nights King? If the bad guys win: why dont they utterly destroy the good guys? (I use bad guys as a shorthand for White Walkers and the Nights King  as early as 2017 it became clear to me that WW and the NK are not the bad guys to be destroyed. Long story short: I see the overall plot of the books as: humanity are the bad guys that deserve to be destroyed, but somehow rather miraculously and without merit survive.) 

Typical ways how other stories resolve such situations wont work. For instance, you say, what if one of the good guys provide cover  fight NK while others retreat? How quickly you could run away through deep snow? From the dead who control weather? You say, yeah, but what if they escape on dragons? I am somehow not sure about it. I dont see Sansa Stark, for instance, escaping Winterfell on a dragon. 

So, the dilemma we face is: NK cant die too early in the season (we think). Good guys cant die all that early in the season either. I mean I am all in favor of putting Winterfell tunnels to use and good guys escaping through them one more time  but how realistic is that they *all* escape? And then what is the purpose of Winterfell confrontation? I believe somehow we should have one good guy less. And Winterfell should somehow matter. For instance, take Sam. Is it likely that he would die at Winterfell? No, because there is no connection between Sam and Winterfell. Jorah - perhaps, but Jorah wouldnt die before killing or wounding Jon first. Arya I suppose is not at Winterfell  she is in KL. 

The development I like to see is: the Nights King needs WF for some ceremonial, judicial, or magical purposes. Perhaps, there is a weapon important for him somewhere at Winterfell. Or he needs his generals to command his army and Starks are supposed to be generals of the Army of the Dead. Or he needs to interact with Bran somehow. Or Lyanna Stark is the bride he was promised and he comes to ask: Where is my bride? Whatever it is, killing all living at Winterfell is not on his agenda. He doesnt care. (Well, we know he cant kill all characters present at WF. And if you propose that, say, three good guys run away through tunnels while NK is killing the rest of the defenders  how you would feel about those good guys after that?) I think Winterfell is the Nights King chance to surprise the audience. Do something unexpected. Do something, if not good, then at least not killing everybody. It will be the first time we recognize the Nights King as Azor Ahai. In parallel, we will be shown Melisandre at Volantis explaining how it all makes sense, how [AA is NK](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a8foxg/spoilers_extended_azor_ahai_a_certain_time_of_day/). Ideally, I would like to see a flashback to Azor Ahai (=NK) as a hero from long time ago. And maybe they planned it for this show, but now will wait for the Long Night. 

Alright, wrapping up: good guys fight at Winterfell and lose, of course. NK doesnt kill them (all) and proceeds south. Surprisingly. 

Or not so surprisingly if Jon actually dies at Winterfell (whether by Jorah or somehow else). A possibility worth considering is this. Observe that Jamie is heading north. Why is he heading north? To help good guys win at Winterfell? But the good guys clearly lose at WF. Then what is the plot purpose of Jamie in the North? Possibly: to kill the Nights King. More observations:

* Jamie is called the Kingslayer and the Nights King is, well, a king. 
* On many occasions on the show Jamie is referred to as an idiot or a fool. Why? (Because *he is*  somebody will post below. You see, I can predict things.) 
* He is carrying a very interesting sword, whose twin is also at Winterfell (see Brienne in the background).
* Jamie is practicing with sword fighting. What good is that when he clearly is not going to kill anybody half competent in a normal fight? Why do the books and the show put it in?

Lets start with the last part: Jamie is not going to defeat anybody in a normal sword fight, but how about a magical fight based on worthy/not-worthy? Clearly, usual martial art skills are useless against the Nights King. But Jaime being short a hand could somehow matter and play to his magical advantage over the NK. 

Jaime kills the NK  hooray, great, good job, Jaime! Well, this is A Game of Thrones we are dealing with. Soon it will become obvious that it wasnt such a great idea. (Hence numerous Jamie as an idiot hints.) Somehow NK is needed. Maybe to control all the dead (similarities with the Lich King in World of Warcraft will be discussed elsewhere). Maybe because justice demands it (long story). Who is better to lead the dead than Jon? (Somebody might say Jaime, but I doubt it. I believe that Jaime and Brienne somehow survive the whole story. I see mythological reasons for whoever kills the NK to become the new NK, but I dont want to consider it.) 

All the necessary ingredients for transforming Jon into the Nights King are there: a magical sword, a weirwood tree, a hero of old (AA = NK), a hero of new (Jon). Bran as a priest who does the ceremony. It makes sense that it would happen at WF. (I often thought it should be at Gods Eye, on that island, but maybe not  I can see how Winterfell would work.) 

Prediction: the heroes cant escape from the North unscratched. They cant all die there either. Leaving Jon behind would balance the story. Emphasizing Jorah and Winterfell settings, the recent teaser makes me believe that Jorahs attack on Jon will happen there. And leave Jon dead (or so we would think?). Jon later might come back as the new Nights King. ",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe season 8 will reveal just how big of a player he was in the events of season 7.  

The master of whispers, the guy who has been 5 steps ahead of almost everything, suddenly had no idea that: 
1. Casterly rock had been abandon and the Lannister army together with the Tarly army was marching on high garden. 
2. Euron Greyjoy and the largest naval fleet ever to sail was on its way to intercept Yara and Ellaria Sand. 

Varys has no true allegiance.  He has proved that many times in the story.  He is a master at playing all sides, which is how he has served so many Kings.  Correct me if Im wrong but the only person who has been capable of blindsiding him has been Littlefinger. 

He brought Dany her allies, that gained him her trust.  He then delivers them right over to Cerci.  That gained him her trust, and all the while Tyrion takes the fall for the defeats.  Notice in the scene on Dragonstone where Tyrion lays out his plan for surrounding kings landing and attacking Casterly rock, the camera cuts to Varys who nods in agreement.  Cerci was 3 steps ahead of Daenerys in all of season 7 with the exception of the one time she did something not advised by Tyrion/Varys.

However, as we all know, this is Game of Thrones. They dont give us happy endings and never flat out make it obvious; therefore, I'm throwing out the unexpected. I personally believe that both Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow are red herrings for the popular ***The Prince that was Promised*** theory and also for whom will end up with the throne.

First off, let me start by saying that **Tyrion** is the heir to the Iron Throne. He is the son of King *Aerys II Targaryen* and *Joanna Lannister*, making him Daenerys's brother and Jon's uncle; therefore, the true heir.

o  Most fans have predicted that Tyrion is a secret Targaryen because of the way Tywin Lannister treated him and also because Daeneryss dragons did not eat him in *Season 6, Episode 2*. Perhaps the dragons sensed his Targaryen blood?

o  Tywin has always despised Tyrion. Maybe he secretly knew that Tyrion was not his son, but decided to raise him anyway?

o  Seasons 2 and 3 were mostly about Tyrions character development. We see how he is treated as an outcast in his own family - similarly to how Jon was treated by Catelyn when he was with the Starks. Remember what Maester Aemon Targaryen told Jon? A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing. That is exactly how all of Daenarys, Jon, and Tyrion has felt throughout the entire series.

o  Tyrion was an effective ruler during his time as the Hand of the King in Season 2 when he ruled Kings Landing in Tywins stead. In a way, the main reason why the Lannister army held its own in the *Battle of Blackwater Bay* was because of Tyrion's leadership. We learn that he also enjoys power and the position of ruling. For all we know, Jon doesnt even want the throne.

o  Adding on to this theory, Jamie is the ***The Prince that was Promised*** because if Tyrion is the rightful heir, Jamie would be considered a prince since hes his half-brother - making him Azor Ahai. Jamie will end up killing his beloved Cersei Lannister in order to create Lightbringer and help bring the defeat of the Night King and the White Walkers.

**Another Theory that is probably already out there**

The Mad King wasnt initially mad. Bran warged back into time to tell the Mad King to make the flames and burn the bodies in order to prevent the White Walkers from being revived. That is why a crap load of wildfire was being manufactured under Kings Landing. Too bad Cersei used up all of it, huh?

* We saw how Bran can influence the past such as when he messed Hodor up, and also when he shouted to his father, Eddard Stark, at the Tower of Joy. Whose to say that he couldnt have messed the Mad King up as well?

There you have it folks, my crazy and insane prediction. I think this will be one of the most unexpected Seasons that no one will actually be able to predict. Im not going to go as far to say who I think will live and who will die. I do think that Sansa is definitely a candidate for death since the Starks are represented by their dire wolves, and Sansa is the only one who has a dead dire wolf.",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am currently rewatching the series and I'm amazed of all the references going back and forth in time, how much one misses the first time you see the show. But one thing that occured to me lately, is that in the last season, the Stark family have one representative of every impactful religion of the GoT-universe.  


We have Jon who, somewhat unwillingly or unknowingly, is an important game piece in R'hllors big plan, him being resurrected being the ultimate proof of this. A religion we've seen have true power and a big impact on the story. We have Arya, who worships the God of Death, which we've also witnessed having true power and a big impact. A fair assumption is that it always has been so, but the nature of assasins is to leave no trails, but having followed Arya the last season, we see how easily these people can change the tides. Then we have Bran, who represent the old gods and has been an extremely impactful person and will be so to an extent we might not yet have imagined. This leaves Sansa, a student of both Peter Baelish and Cersei Lannister, two very cold, scheming, plotting, rational people who don't mess around with anything unworthly, so maybe we have the family atheist as well.  


I don't really count the new gods, since I have no recollection of them making a difference or showing signs of having any true power. Am I wrong in this? Is there anything in the show that I have missed or don't remember?  


Is it a coincidence (I think few things in this show and these books are), or is there any meaning behind the remaining Starks representing every impactful world religion and the cold rationale? What could it be? Do anyone have any input on these thoughts, some own thoughts or some links to anything digging into this topic a bit? ",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The goal would be to take bet on which character are going to die in the next season (hence who whill survive)

It could be very interesting to see some stats like &gt;50% think that XXXX character will die while only 10% thinks that YYYY character will die

Also if some users have the perfect dead pool (dude has correct list of people who will die) would go to a newly created /r/GameOfThrones Hall of Fame with a particular status or whatever.

Maybe with calculating like XX% of voting people have 1/2/3/4/5 errors in their list

If you know who the Mad King was, how insane and cruel he was, you really get the chills here. A dynasty that has fallen out of favor with the nobles of the realm, proud and powerful, yet doomed. A madman letting his young son recite the names of the dragons, their source of power long gone, while ruining their future at the same time.

(SHOW),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/af0119/spoilers_what_are_yalls_favorite_scenes_in_game/,Kent_Grimmer,1547241387,"The title explains it pretty well, what do you guys think were the best scenes in GoT?

I thought that if I had a Reddit account, maybe I could post something (which I don't usually do), and since I didn't want to spoil the show for anyone in any communities I was already in, I thought to came to a place where fans of the show wouldn't mind, so here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted desperately to talk about favorite scenes (not sceneries or whatever, but something in the show that made you laugh very hard, made you feel extremely strong emotions, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite scene in the show up until now (Season 1-7) would have to be the ""Hold the Door"" scene.

It was so beautifully made, I felt emotions so strongly at that time, while watching it. So many thoughts came through my mind, like the fact that Willis' fate was sealed. That he existed purely for one purpose, to Hold the Door. The fact that he slowly spiralled into mental trauma, represented by the ""Hold to Door"" and ending up with the ""Hodor"". It was such a sad scene, interesting, for some reason I even smiled. I don't know why I did, but it happened. That scene was very powerful to me, and I could sit here trying to describe it as much as this block of text could allow me, but it would probably just look like nonsense. And as a side-note, ever noticed that the Stark theme was added for that scene? As in ""he may not be a Stark, but he is a Stark for us"". 

&amp;#x200B;

What scenes made YOU think they were truly amazing? Why did they do that? I want to hear all of your thoughts!

&amp;#x200B;

(I wish to apologize in advance if I have somehow made the post wrongly. I barely came where I thought it would be best, I read the rules, and don't know if I did everything correctly. I hope I did good, I don't post too often on Reddit, I just felt like I really needed to talk about this. Thank you.)

However, we do see a few Andals left alive by the White Walkers. In season 1, episode 1 we see [Will](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Will), [Gared](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Gared), and Ser [Waymar Royce](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Waymar_Royce) travel north of the wall. With Gared and Ser Waymar Royce being killed, and Will left alive. It isn't stated where these men are from, however Waymar Royce and his family are one of the few Southern Families that descend from the First Men; and he meets his end here. Later at the season 2 finale, we see the army of the dead march by, and a White Walker \*\*STARE DOWN\*\* Samwell Tarly. The walker marches past, leaving Sam alive. May this be due to him being descended from the Andals? In season 3 episode 8 we see a walker arrive, trying to take Craster's son, and attacks Gilly and Sam. The Walkers bats Sam aside, and marches forward to Gilly and her baby, both with the blood of the First Men. Does this mean Walkers simply dont have an interest in killing Andals? Any other death at the direct hands of a White Walker can be chalked up to the victim being descended from the First Men: Wildlings, Northmen, the occasional ranger at the Fist of the First Men. In season 7 episode 6, we see the Army of the Dead attack our heroes on the lake. The Walkers stay back, mainly interested in killing the Dragons safely from a far, opting to instead mindlessly send Wights after them. That can explain the hostility to the Andals in the group, who may simply be collateral damage to the Walkers.

In the final episode of season 7, Jaime and Cersei finally have their tension lead to a full rending of their relationship. This happens when Jaime learns that Cersei has planned a double cross of Jon and Danaerys. She reveals her whole plan about the Golden Company and them being ferried by Euron to Westoros to fight the winner of the war against the dead.

Instantly, Jaime sees this plan as insane, but also he refuses to go against his word even if Cersei is willing to. And then Cersei, in a show of her determination to win the Game of Thrones once and for all... Let's Jaime leave King's Landing?

Two minutes prior to this Jaime was planning the organization of troops with his commanders who like Jaime, thought Cersei was telling Jon and Danaerys the truth. No one else seems to know Cersei's plan at all. So she tells this super secret plan to Jaime, that she took great pains of diplomatic theater to hide: she had Euron pretend to retreat to the Iron Islands, and she literally said no to the alliance so that her yes was all the more believable. Then, when Jaime is not on board she just let's him ride North, presumably to tell Winterfell? Why?

Yes, before Jaime leaves it seems that she is almost willing to kill him, but even that was theatre. Cersei must have told the Mountain ahead of time that when she nods to kill Jaime that he shouldn't actually do it.  If not kill him though, why wouldn't she just imprison Jaime to save herself from him aiding her enemies or maybe she could even try to convince him to see ""reason"". If we know Cersei, we must assume, like her maybe fake pregnancy, that all this might be some sort of misinformation she's trying to disseminate to the J+D. The only question is why?

The other possibility is she was willing to bet everything on Jaime following her no matter how crazy her plans are and when it failed she wasn't willing to take action against Jaime out of some lingering love. Either way letting Jaime go is a strange decision. Cersei's strategic decisions have always been questionable, but her tactical intriguing has always been her greatest strength e.g. countering Ned's coup, getting Tyrion framed for kingslaying, blowing up the sept (which kinda was just her cleaning up her own mess tbh).

tl;dr Cersei let Jaime leave KL right after telling him all about her super secret double cross. This could possibly be part of some greater plan involving misinformation.",31,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When the comet passes, Arya says she reminds her of her father's sword. Then Jamie has a dream when he is leaning against a tree reminiscent of the old gods. He dreams of his sword and that of Brienne (the two swords forged from Ice) illuminated with a blue flame and, facing Jamie, there are ""dead"" (the elders of the King's guard). He also seems to dream of a crypt reminiscent of Winterfell's.

Could it be that these 2 swords must come together to form Lightbringer? I also find it interesting that Tywin tries to give the swords a purple color but can not do it.

Also, I think Jon is Azor Ahai given the importance given to Arthur Dayne's sword (which is said to have been forged from a star fallen from the sky). When Ned finds Lyanna, the camera focuses on the sword and not on Lyanna.

Moreover, given the number of times the characters dream of the Winterfell's crypt, I wonder if there is not something ""hidden"" there.

If the warlocks could feel magic return when her dragons were burn, maybe the night king could feel it too, and and perhaps this is why the night king started actively building his army because he could feel that his one way to tear down the wall (the dragons) had finally arrived back into the world.

If we want to go even more tinfoil hatty, what if the night king became more powerful when the dragons were born just like the warlocks? What if he could feel the Targaryan blood in Jon's veins (king's blood is said to be magical) and he wants to continue to provoke Jon to lure the dragons to him?

The prophecy of the Prince that was promised is a false prophecy, aimed at helping the Night King  defeat humanity.  Mellisandre said that she has done her part by bringing ice and fire together---however the final twist is that when ice and fire are brought together, this will advance the Night King's agenda (we see this already because the Night King gets a dragon and brings down the wall).  Every vision that a red priest or priestess has seen in the flames and every prophecy perpetuated by the lord of light's followers, was planted by the White walkers to move the key players (John and Dany) like chess pieces to manipulate present events to favor the Night King.

The entire 7 seasons have happened in the way it's supposed to go, and has resulted in Dany taking her dragon to the Night King, making him more powerful and able to take down the wall.

\*\*Spoiler Warning for Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series by Tad Williams\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

GRRM was  heavily influenced by the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn novels, and the similarities between ASOIAF and Memory, sorrow and thorn are incredible.   It only makes sense that the ending of the MST would mirror the ending of ASOIAF.  There was a false messenger in MST that planted a false prophecy that told that bringing certain circumstances together would defeat the main villain, however it was revealed that this prophecy was planted by the main villain to actually help him.

Before the Three-Eyed Raven speaks, Bran looks confused, unsure of what he's doing. I think TER \*knew\* what would happen if Bran warged into Hodor. This assumption, however, is based on the premise that greenseers can see the future. 

Though being able to see the future hasn't been specified in the series (I think Bran says he can see past and present, but doesn't mention future), TER knew Bran would be the next Three-Eyed Raven, and lead him to the great weirwood tree with the express purpose of training him/bequeathing the power to him. I don't know how he could know this without having some inkling of foresight.

If the Three-Eyed Raven knew what would happen when Bran warged into Hodor, and knew the Knight King was coming, I believe he showed Bran that particular portion of the past at that moment in order for Bran to save himself (by warging into Hodor, ruining Hodor's mind). It's one of those \*the past has to happen in order for the future to happen\* situations, but TER set it up. 

Sure, it was ultimately Bran's action that destroyed Hodor's mind, but I think TER was really to blame by putting Bran in a situation where warging from within a vision was the only real option. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  The Three-Eyed Raven knew what would happen if Bran warged into Hodor at that moment, set up the necessity of the situation and encouraged Bran to do it. ",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Catelyn takes Tyrion prisoner when randomly meeting him in a tavern then later on the road to her sister they are attacked by nearby clans men and.. Tyrion saves her life.
He saves her life.. but why doesn't she reconsider him as the one who attempted murder on her son right there? Doesn't this act shows he means no harm to the Stark, even going out of his way to save her? 

What do you people think of that moment and why Catelyn didn't change her mind on Tyrion's intentions?

From what I've heard the books are just more of a detailed story and includes more backstory that the show merely summarizes or assumes you know. I'll definitely still read the books regardless because come April when the last season ends and I'm overwhelmed with sadness, at least I'll still have the books to read. But I am curious to those who have read the story and seen it come to life on screen, what percentage of the books do you think I have seen shown watching the show? ",10,1,False,self,,,,,

Sure enough they had a second hand copy that they put on hold for me. When I got to the store and looked at the book it seemed really old and not in the best condition. I told the guy behind the counter that it seems a little too rough to pay $15 for and he completely understood. A few seconds later the manager came over and I explained that I was not sure if i wanted to pay $15 for a book that seems a little damaged. He then told me that they shouldn't have taken the book because their policy states they can only take books in near perfect condition. He then decided to just give me the book FOR FREE!!! Anyways I leave the store and decided to google the version I have and many people are saying it's a first edition. I just wanted to see if anyone on this sub can clarify what edition this is and if I actually just got a first edition for free...

First we have to look at how the sword was forged...

""Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife,Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.[1].[1]""  

 https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer

I believe major character deaths will represent the forging of the sword as opposed to us watching someone actually make the sword. I am not sure of the first attempt to temper the blade in water (help me out here... Maybe a Greyjoy or Davos) but the second and third attempts seem very clear.

Attempt 2: Lions Heart - If you subscribe to the very plausible theory that Jaime will be the one to kill Cersei (with Widow's Wail no less), this one seems pretty straightforward. This act will be the representation of Azor Ahai's second attempt to temper the blade. As the legend says ""he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered."" I believe Cersei Lannister is this lion. A fitting end to both Cersei's journey as well as the theories that Jaime could be the prince that was promised. 

Attempt 3: Nissa Nissa - Now for Jon to bear Lightbringer. I believe in the last few episodes not only will Jon and Danny's relationship have progressed, but they will also be facing defeat as well as disagreeing on how to move forward. At some point Jon will learn that he has to kill Dany for one reason or another (maybe she is turning into the Mad Queen, maybe he is told of the prophecy), ""for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade... This time, he called for his wife,Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer"". Danny's sacrafice will represent the final step for Jon to accept the role of Azor Ahai and lead the remains of Westeros against the Night King and his army.

I feel these are great representations of the mythos behind Lightbringer as well as fitting ends for some of the most beloved characters in GoT. Let me know what you guys think, poke holes, and help me build my new theory. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This also means that Bran, not having the statue, is somewhat immortal and hes in all times at the same time, trying to save the future. 

Jons statue looked really old which means he outlived everyone else and was possibly last to survive. Another thing about that means Danny likely died, or else I dont believe Jon would stay in Winterfell with Danny and they would rather stay somewhere else. 

With that being said, if you play close attention to the look in their eyes, and the fact that theyre still in the future, the Night King technically won and is still conquering Westeros because he found them in Winterfell. 
Bran wanted to either 
1. If hes the night king, trap them there or, 
2. Want to show them how bad the future is and help prevent it.

Arya will kill Cyborn while wearing the face of the Zombie Mountain. Think about it. Arts Kills the Mountain off screen and then shocks the audience when she kills Cyborn. 

2. Cersei will die the same way her mother died, while giving birth to a dwarf. This time the dwarf will be female. The prophecy will hold true because Jaimie will have been the father. 

3. Arya will marry Gendry. But it would be far more interesting if she married the hound. 

4. Sansa will reveal that she was mutilated by Ramsey Bolton. Maybe he branded her. Maybe he amputated toes. Theres something left to that story. 

5. Varys will turn out to have been a merman all along. As many have predicted. This will be revealed when he spears Euron Greyjoy in the back at the height of a battle between Euron and Theon, over poor Yara. Yara will have had her tongue removed by Euron and so while she will be the new ruler over the Iron Islands, Theon will be her voice.

6. A Dragon will kill Melisandre after she foolishly tries to sacrifice Daenerys to the flames. 

7. This will all turn out to have been a long tale record by Samwell Tarly and at the end of it all it will turn out that he is the blue eyed giant whos eye they all live in
 
8. Oh and it will turn out that the white walkers and the night king are seeking one thing: revenge for Cersei and Jayme pushing Bran out the window, because of course Bran wants revenge and of course Bran is the night King. Nothing else makes much sense. Bran will reveal all after Jayme and Cersei are dead but when Cersei goes shes taking All of Kings landing with her. 

9. Obviously Sansa will renew her vows to Tyrion and they will ride off into the sunset on the back of a Dragon.

The way Sansa looks at the beginning of this teaser is ominous and it goes out of its way to pair her with her mother while playing a quote about Catelyn's hatred of Jon. This scene would be interesting on multiple levels as Brienne is sworn to protect Arya and so would not be trying to kill her, which would again call back to her fight with Jaime that was also protected by a vow she made to Catelyn. Also the keen will note that Brienne has been said to hate Jon but that the reason would remain obscure, which would obviously be not to spoil this intense confrontation. I could see Arya getting the better of Brienne and then following a terrified Sansa. At this point she will either kill Sansa, cementing her infamy as a 'kinslayer' or Jon would be forced to kill the only sibling that truly cared about him and with whom he was originally being set up to marry in the books.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1815,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-14,2019,1,14,21,afvfgk,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] My thoughts and analysis on the second GOT tease,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/afvfgk/spoilers_my_thoughts_and_analysis_on_the_second/,darrylthedudeWayne,1547469609,"So the second teaser for Game of Thrones season 8 was released last night, We didn't get any new footage (possibly anyways, i'll get into what I mean by that near the end of the post) But what still did get a pretty cool tease and finally the release date of Season 8, which is April 14 so mark your calendar's boys because that is when the first episode of S8 is coming. But yeah this teaser was pretty cool. The only real downside is that they don't show off new attire for S8 they just reuse the same outfits from S7, like you'd think for the first tease showing off the characters that they would show off there new attire for the new season right (especially since Dany and Jorah are getting new attire and there was a library ad awhile ago that had Arya in slightly different clothing then from S7 and a new hair style as well)? But then again the first episode may take place right after S7 so maybe this is the attire they'll have when S8 begins and as the season goes on they get new attire.

But anyways there is some stuff to take away from the tease even if it's not new footage. First up I think Jon walking pass Lyanna and Ned's tombs not only symbolizes Jon's true parentage (oh and that feather from S1 was a nice detail) but also no matter who he is he is still a stark and a stark by blood (which technically even if he is a Targaryen he still is a stark as well considering his mom is a stark) and I think Jon's parentage will play a huge part/role next season, Sansa walking pass Cat's tomb could symbolize that she is not going to be like her mother (it could also be that she is or was like her mother) and has changed since then, and Cat's dialogue fading out when we get to Arya not only symbolizes the fall of the starks and what they've been through (because it's the line where she mentions how all this bad shit happening to her family is because she couldn't love a child that was not hers....that being Jon) but also the fact that Arya does not pass a stark tomb symbolize how far gone she is from what she once was and the starks in general (but that could change this season). 

Now for the tombs. Some people think it means Arya and Sansa will die because there tombs look younger, and Jon will live because his looks older. I don't think this is the case, I think this was just made for the tease. But I do think all three turning around the face the cold coming in could symbolize them focusing on the true threat and leaving there past conflicts behind and avoiding death. Oh yeah and of course the trailer ends with the cold coming in to the crypts probably showing the great war is here and foreshadowing the White Walkers making it to WF (though I can already see some people saying the Jon, Arya, and Sansa specifically in the tease means that they will marry Aegon, Rheaneys, and Visenya style....because that's totally how not only teases work but also how transitions from Siblings to Cousins work (Sarcasm)). As for why Bran is not there? simple. he said it himself in Season 7 that he is not bran anymore, he is the 3ER weather we like it or not. So that's Jon, Arya, and Sansa are the only starks down there.

Now I do have a crackpot prediction that this is not just for the tease but it is to some extent actual footage in the season but it's a vision Bran and/or Howland are giving Jon, Arya, and Sansa in there sleep. But that is just a crackpot prediction, I also read somewhere maybe this is really happening and Bran goes back in the past to have tombs for Jon, Arya, and Sansa built (I can't remember the reddit users name so if your reading this, then shout out to you)? if this is the case the scene may not play out the same way as the tease but the main idea which is Jon, Arya, and Sansa finding tombs of themselves in the crypts could be an actual scene in some way. Either way I really liked the first tease. Besides the fact we don't see new outfits for Jon, Arya, and Sansa it was still a pretty cool tease that got me hyped for S8, more so then the last tease and now I know when to mark my calendar.

That being said, when the NK touched Craster's son and turned him into a White Walker, he was alive. So I'm wondering if there's any possibility that Viserion was still alive and NK touched him and turned him just in time. Can White Walkers even be dead? My understanding is that the wights are re-animated dead corpses whereas WW are not (i.e. ""alive""). Basically I'm saying that Viserion looks like a White Walker, and White Walkers are not dead as far as I know.

Just like in season 6 teaser there are faces of the main characters in the ""Hall of Faces"" but they didn't die in season 6. So i can asssume that producers are only trying to tense up the situation. On the other hand it is that they always implied the death of all the main characters.

Okay so I'm an obsessive nerd when it comes to things. Regardless of what I'm into, whether it be Game of Thrones, Star Wars, The Sopranos, or even video games like Zelda. When I'm hooked on something I really really dive into it. Needless to say, I am the 'Game of Thrones' guy. People around me who watch the show pretty casually will ask me questions, which is all well and good. The problems start to arise when the show actually airs new episodes.

So the main problem will happen with my girlfriend and my mom. Both of which I got into the show. Both of which need somebody with them to explain what is going on. That's fine. However nobody seems to realize that me doing this pretty much ensures that I am taken out of the episode. I cannot watch something when people are talking to me so when I'm watching the show with these guys, its constantly pausing, explaining, unpausing, repeat. Totally fine for them if they want to ask questions, but not how I want my own viewing experience to be. So to counteract this, I watch new episodes of Game of Thrones on my own, and then a day later or so will rewatch that episode with the gf/mom/friend group of guys.

However, it just always seems to be a fight. Everybody gets angry that you want to watch it for the first time by yourself (like what is this? virginity?), they all want to pull you 2-3 different ways and get you to watch it with them. By the time the week is done, I'll have seen the new episode with 2-3 different groups.

The ""Long Night"" as Old Nan said ""lasted a generation"", which is decidedly unspecific. Actually lasting a generation is ridiculous, and like many stories this has to be interpreted (especially since it sort of doubles for the events we are watching unfold).

So the cleanest interpretation I have for what this actually was is that ""Night"" refers to Winter (not necessarily a literal period of darkness), and generation literally means a generation, not ""a long ass-time"". So this story and winter will consume an entire generation, and we've seen it start-

&gt; A generation of Barratheon/Lannisters (Cersei's children, Renly, Stannis) rose to power and fell.

&gt; A generation of Martels (The Sand Snakes) rose to power and fell.

&gt; A generation of Tyrells (Magaery and Loras) rose to power and fell.

We've two more Houses with characters who were too young for power, then came into it in this winter- Stark and Targaryen (SweetRobin is in a weird place, and as he seems to be under a regency- not to mention he is already sickly). I don't think they will make it as the trailer suggests. If the Throne persists, then the next king will be someone who was already affecting the world- basically the Lannisters. Stark and Targaryen *might* persist if people start dying in childbirth (Danaerys), but all the children we've seen grow up are doomed in this winter, which will not have a peculiar length (not more than is usual).

I'll try not to get into why that idea makes no sense, but I just can't figure out one thing - why now?

&amp;#x200B;

There was only one line said during the trial that was relevant to Bran's assassination attempt - ""You told our mother that this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister, but that was another one of your lies. It was yours.""

&amp;#x200B;

None of this is new information for the audience. The knife was Littlefinger's - but we knew that already because he'd admitted as much way back in season 1. He told Cat that it belonged to Tyrion after he lost it in a bet - and we saw that too. And we've known it was a lie since season 1. If that was all you need, then the fans should've concluded that LF was behind the attempt right at the start.

And we got nothing else at all apart from this. In an episode where all of Littlefinger's crimes were explicitly listed - murdering Jon Arryn, murdering Lysa, conspiring with Cersei and Joffrey, betraying Ned, getting Ned arrested and executed - no one says a word about sending an assassin after Bran. So how did people reach the conclusion that LF was behind the attempt based on this episode? What was presented here that we did not know before? What changed?",75,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I've thought for a while that one of two things will happen; either the survivors will opt to abolish the monarchy, or Sansa will be the one to sit on the Iron Throne.

At first, I thought that Sansa was a long shot from being a long shot. She's still the underdog, but unlike a lot of contenders for the throne she's learned to play the game from the best of them, and she plays it well. Without her, Jon wouldn't have won the Battle of the Bastards, and she even managed to outmanoeuvre Littlefinger, who was one of the most politically savvy characters in a series full of them.

Then I thought about Jon and Dany, two of the most likely to sit on the throne at the end of the series, and it got me thinking. Jon's not a character who's ever really shown a desire to be the king. Even the title of King in the North was one he was nominated for, and he seemed pretty reluctant to take the mantle. He was also willing to pledge allegiance to Dany, and has a stronger claim to the throne than hers by virtue of being the son of her elder brother.

Then I thought about Dany. I love Dany, but it's been made clear, even by herself, that as good as she is as leading, ruling is an entirely different matter.

Still, thinking of that got me thinking of the line of succession. If Jon's true parentage becomes public knowledge, he'd supercede Dany's claim, but what about the Baratheon/Lannister?

At this point, the Baratheon line is all but extinct, and so is the Lannisters. At the very least, the only surviving members of the both families are distant enough that we haven't seen them in a long while, and I doubt that after eight seasons they'll hand the crown to Reginald Lannister.

If Cersei dies, would Tyrion be the next in line for the current (legal) line of succession? If he dies too, and assuming that no other Lannister can take his place, what happens to the line? Their marriage was unconsunmated, but as far as I can remember it was never formally annulled, even though Sansa's been married since then. Would she be the next in line by default?

Obviously, this is still a long shot, I don't pretend to know enough about the line of succession so this post is one part clutching at straws (Sansa and Tyrion are my favorite characters) and one part me genuinely trying to figure out the line of succession as it stands. Any input is appreciated.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The episode before, Tyrion was talking to Dany about who is gonna sit on the iron throne after Dany. He mentioned the democratic system the night watch is using. So he was obviously suggesting to implement a simmilar system to Westeros. 

But what if, Dany had a baby? Then, the baby would most likely be the heir to the iron throne and would claim the throne after Dany and Jon die.

So, here is my theory: Maybe Tyrion was worried about exactly that, that Westores would again have a Targaryen leader and there would be no change. I believe, that Tyrion could even murder the baby in order to establish a democratic system in Westeros. Obviously, Tyrion would get beheaded or eaten by a Dragon or worse. But I guess that this would make up for a really bitter sweet ending.

I pretty much digested the trailer as much as possible. But these are my opinions:

The feather on Lilliana stark is either 
A) Bran having a vision of the starks dying 
B) the feather was last seen in season 1 episode 1 when Robert borathean had brought it to her

Then when the feather falls it could mean either 
A) Lilliana never liked Robert, hence the feather falling 
B) its the end of everything and the start of new beginning 

All the voices of the dead like Lilliana and Katherine stark are just for us to be reminded of everything that has happened and how they have shaped the starks 

Theres a part in the trailer that Ned Stark says
You may not have my name, but youre a stark, you have my blood. 
Which to me is so funny because everything he says its true. He has stark blood but he doesnt have the name because his father was a targarean. 
Back in season 1 Ned Stark had also said that the next time they meet they were going to talk about their mother. So I have an idea that Ned was going to tell him the truth about his mom and his real dad. (So Im hoping bran tells him, shows him, or he gets to know the truth before he dies)

What I think realllly gave everyone a big WTF moment, was the statues. 
So everyone is speculating that the statues mean, they will die in the end (after or during the war with the white walkers)
But game of thrones is not forward, 
So 
I think it might also mean that they will become one of the night Kings white walkers,
Or
They will win and then take over the other kingdoms and statues represent their old selfs are dead and theyre very much alive. 


Another thing. In the beginning, Jon walked past Lilliana and then Sansa walked past Katherine stark. Maybe they will become them in the future. 

Lilliana married a targarian and Jon might marry Danny. 
Katherine was the lady of winterfell and Sansa will continue to be the lady of winterfell. 



But in the end I really dont believe that all the starks will die because theres another quote saying that theres always has to be one stark in winterfell. 



But anyone have any other predictions?!!!

I tried for years to get into GoT, but the pending release of Season 8 finally got me off my ass. I have a few big picture questions about the show though:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Why does everyone hate on Season 7 so much? I see a lot of hate and love for S7 online.  I avoided all spoilers thankfully, but I found I was really loving this show and apart from season 5 I thought it was pretty good. I found you can really see the differences from season 6 and how the production value really shot up. I really love the culmination of the seasons before and you can finally see what all these years have been leading up to. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Did anyone else HATE season 5? I know I did.  Nothing notable happened as I remember, and a few of the story lines really peeved me. The whole many-faced god crap was so dumb.  It really had no place in the overall story in my opinion except to make Arya an even bigger badass. Also the whole religious thing was cool, but I wish it had gone deeper and I was really glad to see all of it nuked at the start of season 7. I just feel like it wasn't handled as well as it could have been, and it could have been a lot more cynical than it was. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) How the hell did the world get so small in season 6 and 7.  I get that they really sped everything up to pack lots in as they started going away from source material, but the realistic travel times that I really liked about the show was thrown out the window and these massive time jumps make it all seem kind of rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

4) I saw tons of people get stabbed once in the back and fall down dead, meanwhile Arya gets stabbed 5 times in the stomach and all it takes is some actress to patch her up. I get it's a super picky thing but it felt super unnecessary and overkill. This links back to how unnecessary the whole many-faced god plot line was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I'd say i really love this show.  I think I probably expected a little more especially with all the hype surrounding it, but I'm pleased none the less.",46,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Rickon: Theyve all gone away. 
Bran: Theyll be back soon. Robb will free Father, and theyll come back with Mother. 
Rickon (emphatically): No they wont.

Its interesting that out of the six family members missing from Winterfell (Im including Jon in this count), the three that Bran says will return all meet their end before getting the chance to see Winterfell again. The remaining three, Jon, Sansa, and Arya are all still alive and made it to Winterfell.

So I just have a couple of theories apologies if some of these have cropt up elsewhere.

I think Arya could be used to as an assassin to kill the night king, she could use the face of a soldier of the dead to get close.

Bran to warg into a dragon, if not viserion then one of the others, at least I think this has to happen at some point just for the sheer fun of it.

Obviously cleganebowl already all but confirmed - I am actually wondering if there might be a HT superbowl trailer featuring clegnebowl as an awesome ironic teaser.

I am wondering if there could be some accidental killing of Cersei by Jamie. He killed the mad king and she has definitely started to go a bit mad. I wonder if it would be too cheesy to have a kind of romeo and juliet moment where he kills himself immediately after. From the prophecy Cersei will have to be killed before she gives birth, or the baby is stillborn. And the prophecy certainly sounds like Daenerys would be the one to replace her on the iron throne, but the prophecy was ambiguous when it came to gender. However I feel like when it says ""take all you hold dear"" that this could be a reference to whoever takes the iron throne from cersei would also kill Jamie. Perhaps Jamie would stand in the way and get killed in doing so, or perhaps they are both hanged together, this would fit the theory that they ""came into the world together and will leave together"".

One thing I think we can know for sure is that it cannot be the night king who takes the throne from Cersei as the prophecy stated it was someone younger and more beautiful.

I think Bran will be a lot more active, in battles for example he could warg into soldiers and save one or more of the main characters in key moments, or tell them some bit of important information.

I think there is also a complication with which characters will subsequently become undead. And what is the power of the night king to reanimate the already dead? Like, will Lyanna, Ned, etc etc rise up from the crypt after the night king takes winterfell?

I felt like S7 was very light on major character deaths, so I expect a lot of the major characters to die this season.

I have no idea what could happen, at least all bets are off. GoT has always bucked traditional good v bad stories where the good are seemingly destined to prevail, and imagining the army of the dead taking kings landing and the night king sitting on the iron throne is kind of awesome and would be fitting.

It would also pay off an idea of the series continuing with the freezing of the narrow sea and the subsequent battle for Essos.

But it seems more likely that there is going to be a huge battle and that if the night king is taken out then all of the undead soldiers will again become inanimate. I am sure if enough main characters die and there is a real struggle to do this then it will be just as satisfying.

The hype for this final season is giving me so much crazy adrenaline! Can't wait!!",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I find that ironic because, as we've seen from House Tully, they do not really follow their words.  If anything, they act in contradiction to them.  As do Ned's ""Tully kids"".

Edmure - disobeys King Robb's orders.  Then betrays his family so the Lannisters can take Riverrun

Blackfish - may be the exception, but he did refuse his brother's marriage arrangements

Catelyn - betrayed her son, probably caused him the war in doing so

&amp;#x200B;

3 of Ned's kids have ""Tully features"": Robb, Sansa, Rickon.  Rickon is more or less a non-character, but Sansa betrayed her family with her admittedly coerced letter to Robb, she lied by omission to Jon before the BotB, she questioned Arya's loytalties and motives, and is well positioned to betray Jon this season, she remained loyal to Joffrey and the Lannisters despite being given opportunities to leave and reunite with her family.  Oh, and she betrayed Arya - and thus Lady, her own direwolf - on the King's Road.  I wonder what karma there is if you betray your direwolf...

Robb betrayed his family by imprisoning his mother, forced his uncle (Edmure) to pay for his (Robb's) mistakes, broke his oath to House Frey, and in doing all of this, he failed in his duty to defend and liberate the North...

We dont know exactly how many White Walkers there are invading the North (or the South from their perspective) and we see a handfull of them in Hardhome and when they breach the Wall. 

Lets say for the sake of discussion that there are 10 White Walkers leading the Army of the Undead. it is bound to happen that those act as leaders of the army and will clash with the heroes assembling around Winterfell. 

Who do you think will fight one of those White Walkers, who do you think will win and who might get killed of by fighting them? 


Personally i can see Arya dispatching a White Walker with ease thus showing off her insane abilities she learnt in previous Seasons. 
Furthermore I would argue it is safe to say that characters like Jon, Brienne and probably Jamie will all somehow kill White Walkers as they have Valyrian Steel.
My last prediction is that Beric will see a chance to kill the Night King himself and go for it fighting valiently but dying in the process.

Ive often seen people suggesting that there could be alternate timelines. Bran could be creating and changing possible futures as if time travel is his ultimate weapon to use against the Night King. This is a fair assertion considering what he was able to do to Littlefinger. 

However, I think it's the case that theres a single, fixed time loop, and the show seems to confirm that. Theres really no way of changing anything because it cant be changed. History tells us that Wylis mind became damaged, turning him into Hodor. Bran went back in time and warged into Wylis, inadvertently giving him a seizure which turned him into Hodor. The past, present and future are all set in stone. Thats where the show is most likely to be going, and it would mean that none of the characters had true freedom in any sense.

Perhaps this is the reason for Bran's sudden apathetic personality. How else would you react if you knew that no one had autonomy over their actions? Bran learned this from the Three-Eyed Raven. Events that happened in the past, such as Hodor losing his mind, and Ned hearing a voice at the foot of the Tower of Joy, were caused by events in the future.

Now, this creates a logical problem. There has to have been a time when Ned didn't hear anything and Hodor didn't have a seizure. Bran has to have been born at least once to reach the future and do it all to start the loop. This is the time travel paradox.

So, we have several different types of time travel tropes, and its important to be clear on what Game of Thrones is using or appears to be using. In Terminator, when you time travel, you're creating alternate timelines. In Back To The Future, you're destroying an existing timeline to create a new one because their logic dictates that two cannot exist. Game of Thrones uses the loop structure where time is a sequence of predetermined events that always repeats itself, like in HP: The Prisoner of Azkaban.

I recently watched a movie called Arrival, which solves the paradox of the loop by detaching the events of the film from the constraints of our conventional understanding of time. We're liberated from a linear perception where the future is a different thing to the past because we're given an omniscient perspective where the past, present, and future are all combined into one, and they no longer require a start point because both ends of the loop are being drawn at the same time. Arrival explains it as palindromic, like the name Hannah. It doesn't matter which way you read that name it still says, Hannah. Game of Thrones will probably take a similar direction.

This can be hard to wrap your head around, but what it comes down to is that everything is predetermined, nothing falls out of the experience of the time loop. If you were to restart the GoT universe over and over, Jon will always be a bastard, Jon will always know nothing, Ned will always die, Arya will always hate knitting, and Geoffrey will always be a dick. Jojen, The Three-Eyed Raven, Melisandre, Bran and many others have experienced this to some extent. They all had visions of the past, present and future, and Melisandre said it was unclear which one she saw at any given time. Interestingly, this is Jojens house sigil:

\[url=[https://imgbb.com/\]\[img\]](https://imgbb.com/][img])[https://i.ibb.co/tqgZmbh/250px-Reed-coat-of-arms.png\[/img\]\[/url\]](https://i.ibb.co/tqgZmbh/250px-Reed-coat-of-arms.png[/img][/url])

If you look far enough into the past, you realise that it all has a very coincidental nature; the Targ bois were tipped off to the doom of Valyria by a vision of the future, allowing them to escape. Without the Targs there would be no Aegon's conquest, no Mad King, and no Robert's Rebellion. We can also see evidence of a suspiciously cycle-like nature with the red comet, the seasons, and The Long Night. If time is a loop, then the future is already written, the ink is dry. Events in A Song Of Ice And Fire, such as Robert's rebellion, The Long Night, Ned's execution, every spring, summer, autumn and winter and what Jon had for dinner will happen every single time in the same order without fail. The implications of this are that none of the characters have, what we would describe as ""free will"".

What does it mean if the characters motivations, whims and desires are not their own? The more and more I think about this I realise that it could all be psychologically symbolic of materialism. Primarily in the west, we believe in dualism, the mind and body as two opposing concepts. Materialism is the theory that humans are entirely physical beings and governed by the laws of physics, which govern every action and reaction in the universe. A sense of ""free will"" is not compatible with materialism because it presupposes that we are not in the driving seat. Our mind is subject to natural laws and isnt separate from the body. One gets the sense that the time loop in Game of Thrones is incompatible with free will, in turn, dualism.

Long winded...

Evidence for an idea like this would be hard to come by for obvious reasons, but some interesting ideas that seem to be of a similar vein are from the fandom wiki:

*Tyrion's prolonged discussion of Orson Lannister, their drooling cousin, lasts nearly four minutes in ""The Mountain and the Viper"". The writers explained in the Inside-the-Episode featurette that they intended that when faced with his probable death, Tyrion's mind is wandering to question why seemingly random acts of brutality happen in the world and that he saw Orson smashing beetles as a sort of microcosm of this question. The analogy is that if Orson was an almighty force inflicting death and destruction on insects, if there is a higher power inflicting death and destruction on human beings - whatever god, gods, ""nature"", or ""fate"" this power may be - Tyrion would at least feel better knowing there was some underlying reason that went into causing such brutality. He also wouldn't be particularly upset if there are no higher powers, and bad things truly happen at random. But Tyrion felt that Orson wasn't acting randomly, some sort of decision-making process was going into his actions, though he could not discern it: what frightens Tyrion is that some unknown, but still reasoning thing or cosmic powers are intentionally directing people towards death and destruction, yet all of our attempts to comprehend why they are doing this (even a simple reason like ""hate"") are in vain.*

And this is from Art of The Title:

*A fiery astrolabe orbits high above a world not our own; its massive Cardanic structure sinuously coursing around a burning center, vividly recounting an unfamiliar history through a series of heraldic tableaus emblazoned upon it. An intricate map is brought into focus as if viewed through some colossal looking glass by an unseen custodian. Cities and towns rise from the terrain, their mechanical growth driven by the gears of politics and the cogs of war.""*

Ill leave you with this:

*Varys*

*Three great men sit in a room: A king, a priest, and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword; each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives? Who dies?*

*Tyrion*

*Depends on the sellsword.*

*Varys*

*Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favour with the gods.*

*Tyrion*

*He has a sword. The power of life and death.*

*Varys*

*Then if its swordsmen who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The Executioner? Or something else*

The final scene shows Cersei sitting atop the iron throne.  A dark and dreary score from Ramin Djawadi plays in the background.  The camera pans to a profile shot of Cersei.  The camera slowly zooms in and the viewer begins to see some scarring and a tiny flap of skin on the side of her face.  ""Cersei"" quickly fixes the skin blemish.  The camera angle switches to a straight-on angle.  ""Cersei"" has a slight grin on her face.  The audience now knows that Arya sits on the iron throne after crossing the final name off her list.  

&amp;#x200B;

Reasoning: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Every main character dies because that is the nature of the show.  Not a hard to figure this out. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""Valar Morghulis"" (""all men must die"") indicates that some ""female"" character is going to be left ruling Westeros in the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""All men must die"" could be interpreted to mean that ""man"" must die, as in humankind.  But Arya is ""no one.""

Let me know what you guys think!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/agcknz/spoilers_my_theory_based_off_the_new_game_of/,lotusrising62988,1547582375,"I think the Game of Thrones teaser for season 8 is meant to make our minds spiral into different directions. I believe the most obvious direction is seeming like Jon lives and Arya and Sansa die young BUT i think there is a way different meaning to this trailer. I think this is a symbol of House Stark making it through. This to me is probably right after Jon finds out his true parentage and when he may not believe what Bran and Samwell tell him, Bran may have then said go take a look for yourself down in the crypts. The Stark children are not placed with the their parents down in the crypts. Ned may have done this as well because he already knew that Arya was not going to be a lady but wanted to be a knight (Ned always said she reminded him of his sister). Jon had went to the wall and Sansa was just Sansa. I think that this is Neds way of saying (You may not have my name but you have my blood and that he IS a STARK) and Brans way of showing him that what he has said is true. This also may have been Neds way of saying even though you have Targaryan blood, do not forget who you really are. This to me would he a bittersweet ending. To choose his sisters and Winterfell over the love of Dany. Family has always been Jons everything. Even when his Uncle disappeared it tore Jon apart. He loves his sisters and he loves his home. He loved his father and he loved his brothers. The north is in him and he will do whatever he has to do to protect what he has left. By doing so I believe he will defeat what needs to be defeated and change Westeros forever. Another thing is what Jon says to Theon Greyjoy at Dragonstone. 

THEON GREYJOY:Ive always wanted to do the right thing, be the right kind of person, but I never knew what that meant, it always seemed like there was, like there was an impossible choice I had to make, Stark or Greyjoy.

JON SNOW:Our father, was more of a father to you than yours ever was..

THEON GREYJOY:He was.

JON SNOW:And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.

THEON GREYJOY:I did. Theon says ashamed.

JON SNOW:But you never lost it. Hes a part of you, just like hes a part of me.

THEON GREYJOY:But the things Ive done

JON SNOW:Its not my place to forgive you for all of it, but what I can forgive, I do.

Theon is shocked and by the way he looks at Jon its clear that Jons forgiveness means everything to Theon.

JON SNOW:You dont have to choose. Youre a Greyjoy and youre a Stark.

THEON GREYJOY:When I was Ramsays prisoner, Yara, tried to save me, shes the only one who tried to save me, she needs me now.

JON SNOW:So why are you still talking to me?

Right here Jon is telling Theon its ok to not choose between the two families. No matter what he chooses he will always be a Stark and he will always be a Greyjoy but his duty and what is right is to save his sister.

This backs up I think what im saying about Jon, Sansa and Arya. 

Jon may feel the need to stay true to his Targaryan blood but Jon has a duty to his family and will do the right thing.

My friends kept talking about the Game of Throne Show, and one told me that I had to view it because of stuff called Red Wedding and such (But he didn't gave me any clue ! no spoilers, I told him to do so)

Oh men that was astounding, like I knew something fishy was going on when Xaro Xohen Duksos (not sure how to spell it lol) decided to use the special law (forgot how is it called) from Qarth, like the Spice Trader wents NUTS !! But I never thought it would be this violent ! The treason he did with the bald warlock or mage, holy cows that was epic, like when the 9 bald men killed the rest of the leaders I was so shocked, god thanks Daenerys wasn't killed or used by the bald mage (I thought that Xaro wanted to marry her ???)

The end is so savage like Xaro and the hooker finished in the empty vault haha, they can't even eat each others due to the handcuffs

Sad that the main spice trader died I thought he was some kind of really important character for the show, he had a lot of charisma and i hope that they will bring him back in another role or something lol, he is really dope.:)

Ive seen suggestions that there could be alternate timelines. Bran could be creating and changing possible futures as his ultimate weapon to use against the Night King. This is a fair assertion considering what he was able to do to Littlefinger.

However, I think it's the case that theres a single, fixed time loop, and the show seems to confirm that. Theres really no way of changing anything because it cant be changed. History tells us that Wylis mind became damaged, turning him into Hodor. Bran went back in time and accidentally warged into Wylis, inadvertently giving him a seizure which turned him into Hodor. The past, present and future are all set in stone. Thats where the show is most likely to be going, and it would mean that none of the characters have true freedom in any sense.

Bran learned this from the Three-Eyed Raven. Events that happened in the past, such as Hodor losing his mind, and Ned hearing a voice at the foot of the Tower of Joy, were caused by events in the future. Perhaps then, this is the reason for his sudden personality shift to a more apathetic nature. How else would you react if you knew that everyone was a mere puppet of ""fate""?

Now, this creates a logical problem. There has to have been a time when Ned didn't hear anything and Hodor didn't have a seizure. Bran has to have been born at least once to reach the future for the first time, starting the loop. This is the time travel paradox.

So, we have several different types of time travel tropes, and its important to be clear on what Game of Thrones is using or appears to be using. In Terminator, when you time travel, you're creating alternate timelines. In Back To The Future, you're destroying an existing timeline to create a new one because their logic dictates that two cannot exist. Game of Thrones uses the loop structure where time is a sequence of predetermined events that always repeats itself, like in HP: The Prisoner of Azkaban.

I recently watched a movie called Arrival, which solves the paradox of the loop by detaching the events of the film from the constraints of our conventional understanding of time. We're liberated from a linear perception where the future is a different thing to the past because we're given an omniscient perspective where the past, present, and future are all combined into one, and they no longer require a start point because both ends of the loop are being drawn at the same time. Arrival explains it as palindromic, like the name Hannah. It doesn't matter which way you read that name it still says, Hannah. Game of Thrones will probably take a similar direction.

This can be hard to wrap your head around, but what it comes down to is that everything is predetermined, nothing falls out of the experience of the time loop. If you were to restart the GoT universe over and over, Jon will always be a bastard, Jon will always know nothing, Ned will always die, Arya will always hate knitting, and Geoffrey will always be a dick. Jojen, The Three-Eyed Raven, Melisandre, Bran and many others have experienced this to some extent. They all had visions of the past, present and future, and Melisandre said it was unclear which one she saw at any given time. Interestingly, this is Jojens house sigil:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ukly4zdn3oa21...*

If time is a fixed loop, then the future is already written, the ink is dry. Events in A Song Of Ice And Fire, such as Robert's rebellion, The Long Night, Ned's execution, every spring, summer, autumn and winter will happen in the same way and in the same order without fail. The implications of this are that the characters are not autonomous, free will does not exist.

What does it mean if the characters motivations, whims and desires are not their own? The more and more I think about this I realise that it could all be psychologically symbolic of materialism. Primarily in the west, we believe in dualism, the mind and body as two opposing concepts. Materialism is the theory that humans are entirely physical beings and governed by the laws of physics, which govern every action and reaction in the universe. A sense of ""free will"" is not compatible with materialism because it presupposes that we are not in the driving seat. Our mind is subject to natural laws and isnt separate from the body. One gets the sense that the time loop in Game of Thrones is incompatible with free will, in turn, dualism.

It would make sense for Martin to incorporate Sci-Fi elements into the story, as his earlier works were in that genre, and many authors use themes from contemporary psychology to inspire and give depth to their writing.

Long winded...

Evidence for an idea like this would be hard to come by for obvious reasons, but some interesting ideas that seem to be of a similar vein are from the fandom wiki:

*Tyrion's prolonged discussion of Orson Lannister, their drooling cousin, lasts nearly four minutes in ""The Mountain and the Viper"". The writers explained in the Inside-the-Episode featurette that they intended that when faced with his probable death, Tyrion's mind is wandering to question why seemingly random acts of brutality happen in the world and that he saw Orson smashing beetles as a sort of microcosm of this question. The analogy is that if Orson was an almighty force inflicting death and destruction on insects, if there is a higher power inflicting death and destruction on human beings - whatever god, gods, ""nature"", or ""fate"" this power may be - Tyrion would at least feel better knowing there was some underlying reason that went into causing such brutality. He also wouldn't be particularly upset if there are no higher powers, and bad things truly happen at random. But Tyrion felt that Orson wasn't acting randomly, some sort of decision-making process was going into his actions, though he could not discern it: what frightens Tyrion is that some unknown, but still reasoning thing or cosmic powers are intentionally directing people towards death and destruction, yet all of our attempts to comprehend why they are doing this (even a simple reason like ""hate"") are in vain.*

And this is from Art of The Title:

*A fiery astrolabe orbits high above a world not our own; its massive Cardanic structure sinuously coursing around a burning center, vividly recounting an unfamiliar history through a series of heraldic tableaus emblazoned upon it. An intricate map is brought into focus as if viewed through some colossal looking glass by an unseen custodian. Cities and towns rise from the terrain, their mechanical growth driven by the gears of politics and the cogs of war.""*

Ill leave you with this:

*Varys*

*Three great men sit in a room: A king, a priest, and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword; each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives? Who dies?*

*Tyrion*

*Depends on the sellsword.*

*Varys*

*Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favour with the gods.*

*Tyrion*

*He has a sword. The power of life and death.*

*Varys*

*Then if its swordsmen who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The Executioner? Or something else*

He didnt have to take the mantle/persona of Kingslayer. To me, it seems like he used that moment to justify, or perhaps consolidate, his hubris, with Ned as his nave, unwavering foil.

so this is not really an important thing but a fun little detail I noticed while rewatching some GoT episodes.

I am referring of the last 30 seconds of this clip [https://www.youtube.com/watchv=0fwI1b1zTJo&amp;index=13&amp;list=PLHypti1KpF0XXg34B4UYrPrrJlNAgrUPh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fwI1b1zTJo&amp;index=13&amp;list=PLHypti1KpF0XXg34B4UYrPrrJlNAgrUPh)

Not even 10 seconds after Jon leaves Castle Black, this guy goes up to the new Lord Commander and asks ""Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"". It's one of the simplest decisions to be made and yet they all stand around the New Lord Commander not knowing what to do. In my opinion it brilliantly shows the lack of order and organisation at the Night's Watch without a proper leader. After all, they are all a bunch of misfits who don't really know what to do once their commander is gone.

It also highlights Jon's leadership skills (and the previous LCs' like Allister Thorne for that matter)",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

How cool would it be to have two Targaryen's in Winterfell and find these eggs! I know the timing is off because they would have to grow but I think this is one of my favorite, crazy end game theorys!

So we know that Lyanna is Jons mother and Lyanna lies within the crypts of Winterfell. This means that through Jons entire childhood and to this day his mother was also there with him and he had no clue whatsoever. In fact he probably saw her statue/remains on multiple occasions and just didnt think much of it which is kinda messed up. Ned also knew the entire time that Jons mother was with him and yet he had to always keep him mouth shut and keep letting Jon think hes a bastard. Overall when you think about it its just pretty messed up and I imagine it will likely emotionally effect Jon pretty hard when he finds out. ,23,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm sure you know how much this reflects real life to an uncanny degree.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Rickard Karstark despises Jaime for murdering his son (in the show he was the gaoler/bodyguard during Jaime's imprisonment) while Tyrion adores Jaime (perhaps excessively so). Ned resents Jaime for getting away with breaking his vows. Jaime reciprocates Ned's resentment for *hypocritically* judging him. Jaime is really the best example here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lysa is obsessively in love with Petyr, whereas Varys knows him as the man who ""would see this kngdom burn, if he could be king over the ashes."" Really, I could go on all day about this. Even the characters we perceive as 'well-intentioned' are thought the worst of by other characters - Tormund was the *leader* of the pillaging and raping of Olly's village, so understandably he feels Jon *betrayed* him by siding with the wildlings.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is the heart of why I love this series. Perceptions and judgements, and how people act on them. *Politics*. I may be concluding a perhaps novel observation with a trite judgement of ""I love this show for the politics, the white walkers are inadequate antagonists"", but really, *I fucking love this show*.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a possible theory that Varys would have been in contact with ""future-bran"" on multiple occasions and that's how he would know which string to pull and when? So Varys would be kind of Bran's tool.

Most glaringly were the amount of teleportation taking place, with characters appearing in locations around the map with no regards to the vast distances involved, and with no intermediate scenes of them travelling. It had smart characters artificially made a lot dumber for the sole purpose of drama or to move the plot somewhere (ex: the dumb capture the wight plan or Baelish completely failing to defend himself). Characters didn't face the negative consequences for their actions which is jarring when compared to earlier season where characters always faced the consequences of their actions (ex: Cersei burned down the sept last season and no one cared; Daenarys burned down the dothraki temple and none of the dothraki care; Jaime charged Drogon and got away fine; Tormund was covered in wights and was fine). And some things were just forgotten about, like what's happening with Edmure now that the Freys are dead? What's Howland Reed doing? He's an important character and still alive so why haven't we seen him? Where is Ghost?

So naturally, I decided to go ahead and list the changes I would have made to Game of Thrones, Season 7, to avoid these problems. I have kept a lot of the same scenes and plotlines intact, but I've reordered, deleted or simply changed scenes so that the plot makes more sense and has fewer holes in it. Often I've done nothing but change the location where something happens. If I don't mention a scene at all, that means there are no changes to it. 

The main overarching changes are 1) the suicide mission beyond the wall will be to rescue Bran, not to get a wight 2) The peace deal with Cersei happens before the suicide mission 3) The Winterfell plotline is completely demolished and I've rewritten it from scratch. It reallly was too dreadful to salvage. Pretty much the only thing kept is that it ends with Baelish on trial. 4) I've added a lot more content than I've deleted, so you would probably need 10 episodes to cover everything instead of 7, but that's OK because other seasons were also 10 episodes. 

To make it easier to understand, I've split up the story into 5 major plotlines, and named them after the locations and characters who feature prominantly in them. I will go over all the changes I'm making to each plotline before moving onto the next. Of course, some characters will feature in several plotlines and the plotlines will also connect at various places. These 5 plotlines are:

**A) DORNE, STORMLANDS, DRAGONSTONE, UNSULLIED and GREYJOYS**

This plotline takes place mostly in the beginning of the season and follows Dany's conquest of the 7 kingdoms up until the peace deal with Cersei, and also includes the negotiations between Jon and Daenarys. Prominant events are the conquest of the Stormlands, the conquest of Dragonstone and the negotiations between Daenarys and Jon on dragonstone.

**B) KING'S LANDING, REACH, WESTERLANDS, LANNISTERS and DOTHRAKI**

This plotline follows the Lannisters in the war against Daenarys. The main focus is the sequence of events that eventually leads to the capture of Highgarden, followed by the Battle of Blackwater Rush. This plotline mostly ends with the peace deal with Daenarys though not completely because Cersei is still plotting to break the deal. 

**C) OLD TOWN, WALL, SUICIDE MISSION, BRAN and SAM**

This plotline follows the war against the white walkers. The sequence of events starts with Sam's research in the Citadel , continues with the suicide squad's mission beyond the wall and it ends with the Night King bringing down the wall. 

**D) RIVERLANDS, NECK, BRIENNE, EDMURE, and BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS**

This doesn't really count as a plotline, more of a set of subplots relating to the other 4 main plotlines. A rough theme uniting them is that they all happen in roughly the same locations and most contain conflicts between Cersei and the North. It includes Arya's adventures in the riverlands before she gets tied into the Winterfell plot, the Brotherhood's adventures before they join the White Walker plot, and a few things for Brienne and Edmure to do so they're not left out.

**E) WINTERFELL, VALE, SANSA, LITTLEFINGER and VARYS**

This is the main political plotline of this season. I mentioned that I'd deleted the original Winterfell plotline and rebuilt it fom scratch. Though it still revolves mainly around the struggle between Sansa and Littlefinger in Winterfell, and it ends with Littlefinger's trial. It will tie most of the other plotlines together as the North reacts to outside events, and the trial will serve as the series finale. Varys will take part in this plotline because he needs something to do and Tyrion is already doing the politics in relation to Cersei.

I've also made some changes to season 6, and I've set up one minor plotline for season 8. [Here's also a set of maps to show what's going on](https://imgur.com/a/LLTeFdY) With that said, here's the list of changes:

#SEASON 6

* Yara only steals some of the ships from the Greyjoy fleet, not the whole lot. So Euron does not need to magic up a new fleet this season; he already has a fleet.

* Varys does not return to Mereen after recruiting Olenna+Sandsnakes. He waits in Dorne for Dany to arrive. No teleporting!

#DORNE, STORMLANDS, DRAGONSTONE, UNSULLIED and GREYJOYS

* Daenarys arrives not on Dragonstone but Yronwood (in Dorne) because a) Cersei currently holds Dragonstone b) This place is a lot easier for her allies to travel to c) it's much easier to supply food to. The initial war council meetings take place here.

* The basic strategy decided at the war council is to basically just march north towards King's Landing. The Dothraki are sent to the Reach (it's good terrain for them and is also capable of feeding them); the Unsullied + Dany&amp;co head north to take the stormlands, while the Greyjoys+Sandsnakes are sent to take Dragonstone (which Dany regards as particularly important). 

* The naval battle between Euron and Yara+Sandsnakes takes place while the fleet are travelling to Dragonstone to capture it. This means that Euron's fleet no longer needs super-speed and stealth to catch up to them, and also shows that Cersei isn't leaving a valuable fortress undefended.

* The unsullied capture Storm's End instead of Casterley Rock. This is because Storm's End is far more valuable strategically, being between Dragonstone, King's Landing, the Reach and Dorne (ie: all places that fighting takes place) and it's a lot easier for the unsullied to get to (Casterley Rock is really far away). It does mean that Tyrion's ""I built the sewers at Casterley Rock"" has no plot significance but it's not as though anyone was expecting it to. Dany+dragons are not present for this due to leaving for the Reach to deal with a problem with the Dothraki over there. (see the section on the Reach for that plotline)

* Daenarys makes a second attempt to capture Dragonstone except this time she brings her dragons. Euron is in King's Landing while this happens (giving Cersei her 'gift' and maybe looking to see if he can install a ballista on his ship) when this happens. The rest of the Ironborn abandon Dragonstone and flee back to King's Landing rather than face the dragons alone.

* The scenes of Daenarys arriving at Dragonstone take place now. Also the scene where Mellisandre tells her about the prophecy. Daenarys decides to set up base here.

* Jon leaves for Dragonstone early in the season to go mine the dragonglass, not to see Daenarys (he doesn't know about Daenarys yet). As well as Davos, he brings along a few soldiers as well as a bunch of commoners (who will be doing the actual mining). There is an mid-travel scene in White Harbour with Lord Manderley, who mentions that the Northern fleet has been bolstered by the addition of Stannis's old fleet.

* Jon &amp; Davos arrive at Dragonstone shortly after Daenarys has captured it and notice the Targaryan flag which confuses them. Tyrion (who is familiar with both Jon and Sansa) manages to negotiate a meeting between Daenarys and Jon, which takes place pretty much the same as in the show.

* As part of the negotiations between Jon and Daenarys, Davos goes to fetch Gendry, who is not in King's Landing but rather Sharp Point. He will potentially be useful to Dany because she needs someone to be lord of the recently captured stormlands. This pleases Dany's advisors and Dany legitimises Gendry.

* After the argument between Tyrion and Dany about her succession, Dany orders Tyrion to go watch over the Dothraki to prevent another rebellion.

* After the Battle of Blackwater Rush, Dany returns to dragonstone to talk with her advisors and Jon. Cersei has threatened to burn down the whole of King's Landing and Dany wants advice on how best to proceed. She mentions that Tyrion, who is currently overseeing the siege, has a plan, (which is to slowly convert the population of King's Landing to their side and get them to disarm the wildfire themselves). But this plan will take a very long time. 

* While on dragonstone, Jorah and Sam show up. A conversation with Jorah finally convinces Dany that Jon has actually been telling the truth this whole time and that the White Walkers are real. This is what precipitates the peace deals. There is also an awkward/sad moment when Sam learns that his family is dead and Dany is the one who killed them.

#KING'S LANDING, REACH, WESTERLANDS, LANNISTERS and DOTHRAKI

* Jaime leaves King's Landing in episode 1 right after Euron's scene (he has to travel a lot so best start early)

* Jaime has a scene where he tries to rally the Lannister bannermen to fight Daenarys. Jaime is unable to get much support since they are still recovering from the war of the 5 kings. And we see the damage that Cercei exploding the sept of Baelor had last season, with many of the bannermen being angry at Cersei. As a result, the Lannister army that goes to attack High Garden is particularly small. (and it is not a complete surprise that it's coming - people do notice it)

* Meanhile, the Dothraki are sent to the Reach to defend it from a potential Lannister attack (being close to both the Westerlands and King's Landing). However, without Daenarys accompanying them, a large section of them quickly revert to their old ways and start pillaging the land. Moreover, we get a few conversations among the Dothraki that reveal that some of them aren't happy with their sacred place being burnt down last season, at being forced across the narrow sea, or being forced to take orders from Dany, who is far from a typical Khal. Others want to follow Daenarys and refrain from pillaging. The armies of the Reach go hide in their castles.

* Dany hears the news and immediately leaves on dragon to deal with this problem. She burns the rebel Khals as punishment for pillaging the reach and to set an example for the other Dothraki. There is also a scene where Olenna verbally shits on Dany for losing control of her Dothraki. Olenna demands that the Dothraki be removed from the Reach; she has learnt that the Lannister army is a lot smaller than expected and she feels confident in being able to defend herself without Dothraki help. She does, however, agree to continue sending food to Dany's army if she will kill Cersei.

* Later, Dany's advisors are very unhappy when they learn both what the Dothraki did and what Dany did to take back control, viewing the latter as the action of a tyrant; this also sparks a big debate as to what to do with the Dothraki once the war is over, which ends up being inconclusive. 

* The secret meeting between the Tarleys + Jaime takes place in Jaime's war tent; not King's Landing (which is too far for the Tarleys to travel to) and thus Cersei is not present for it. The earlier pillaging of the Reach by the Dothraki shows that the Tarleys do have a very good reason for hating the Dothraki and betraying the Tyrells: they don't want their food sent to the Dothraki that just pillaged through their lands!

* The siege of Highgarden will have the Tarleys inside Highgarden open the gates for the Lannister army, to emphasisze what a betrayal this is, and to explain how the Tyrells could lose such a strong castle.

* The Battle of Blackwater Rush happens pretty much the same: the Lannister/Tarley alliance meets up with the King's Landing army (which now includes a ballista) and start moving the gold+food into the city when the Dothraki + Dany arrive and attack them. The differences are that Dany does not burn the food: she captures it for herself, and also that at the end, Jaime+Bronn do not swim underwater in full armour for 500 meters, they actually get captured by the Dothraki.

* Tyrion convinces Daenarys to spare Jaime and not burn him with the Tarleys, but to instead take him as a hostage. Meanwhile, Bronn bends the knee to Daenarys to avoid burning. 

* There is a scene where Cersei, Euron and Qyburn discuss what to do now that Daenary's forces are sieging King's Landing. Cersei reveals that she has the whole thing laced with wildfire and sends a message to Daenarys that if any of her enemies sets foot in King's Landing she will blow the whole thing up. Euron wants to attack Dragonstone but Cersei rejects this, reminding Euron that Daenarys can easily travel back there with her dragons. 

* The scene between Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn happens while Jaime in captured at the Dothraki camp just outside King's Landing instead of inside King's Landing. They want to avoid having all of King's landing explode. They release Jaime to get Cersei to come out and negotiate a peace deal. 

* The peace deal happens at this point, BEFORE the mission beyond the Wall. This means teleporting between the Wall and King's Landing/Dragonstone no longer happens. Also no wight is present: whether Cersei believes in the WWs or not is irrelevant, she is in a very bad negotiating position and really needs this ceasefire. During these negotiations, Euron storms out angrily and agrees to nothing. Jon agrees to bend the knee to Daenarys if she accompanies him north and helps him fight the WWs, although this angers Cersei. The scene where Tyrion promises something secretely to Cersei before she will agree is still here in my version. Cersei eventually agrees to also send the remaining Lannister forces north too and that ONLY once the war against the WWs is over, she will give up the throne and instead become warden of the west. She also frees Elaria, who heads back to Dorne.

* There is a reunion scene between Cersei and Jaime where he learns of Cersei's pregnancy. 

* In a later scene however, Jaime discovers that Cersei is plotting to betray Jon &amp; Daenarys: she has no intention of giving up her throne. She mention she has an ""ally"" in the north, who she hopes will turn the tables against Daenarys [spoiler: that ally is Littlefinger]. Jaime leaves Cersei to go north (this is nearly identical to the real show)

#OLD TOWN, WALL, SUICIDE MISSION, BRAN and SAM

* Periodically throughout the season (once every other episode?), the Night's Watch see wights close to the wall near Castle Black. The wights are dragging a large number of stones and pilling them up. Eventually, people realise that they're building a gigantic ramp which they're going to use to get over the wall. Nothing the Night's Watch+wildlings do is able to stop the wights from dragging more and more stones to the Wall. This shows that the White Walkers aren't sitting on their asses all season: they do have a plan. Also with this change, Daenarys losing a dragon will no longer be entirely responsible for getting the White Walkers passed the wall: the WW were going to get passed eventually.

* Bran does not reach the Wall; he (with Benjen and Meera) can't get passed a large army of wights close to the wall. Benjen burns Bran's arm to remove the mark and hides them in a different Weirwood tree. The mission beyond the wall will be to rescue Bran, not the stupidity that is the ""capture a wight"" plan.

* Bran will sends visions to Jon to try and call for help. Jon dreams of a 3-eyed raven showing him how to get to a weirwood tree in the far north. Later, he dreams of his brother Bran climbing the Winterfell weirwood tree and asking for help to get down. Jon doesn't understand either vision.

* Meanwhile in the Citadel, Sam, instead of discovering the presence of dragonglass on Dragonstone (information he already knew), he discovers that a certain ""3-Eyed Raven"" is of critical importance to defeating the White Walkers. He sends this information to Winterfell [note: Jon has already left for Dragonstone so won't get the message]

* Sam and Gilly accompany Jorah to dragonstone and talk about the White Walkers. 

* Sam reunites with Jon on Dragonstone and tells him about the 3-Eyed Raven. Jon now understands his earlier vision from the 3-Eyed Raven.

* After the peace deals, the team travels by boat to Eastwatch, while the Dothraki will go via land and the Unsullied stay behind to guard the castles. They stop off at Ramsgate to unload a few wagons filled with dragonglass; there is a scene with Lord Manderley who seems extremely suspicious of Jon and Daenarys but does nothing. [Note: Due to events in the Winterfell plotline, Manderley considers Daenarys an enemy of the North, and Jon a potential traitor which is why he acts weird] [Keen-eyed viewers might also notice someone suspicious in the background who is examining everyone getting off the boat]

* They continue to the wall where Jon and Sam reunite with the Night's Watch and the Wildings. They meet the Brotherhood without Banners, who are not in prison but have actually just taken the black and joined the Night's Watch. Edd also informs them of a raven from Dragonstone; apparently Euron's fleet was spotted following them as they left Dragonstone; on the other hand the northern fleet reports nothing unusual; it is suggested that maybe Euron was going to Braavos but they should remain vigilant nevertheless. 

* The mission has some actual planning; they bring sledges and sledge-dogs to travel faster. Ghost is pulling Jon's sledge (so he actually appears this season). Jon insists on going himself because he is the only one who knows where to find Bran. Tyrion convinces Dany to stay at the wall but fails to stop Gendry. Edd and Sam show Dany around what will be the northern border of her new kingdom. 

* The team succesfully finds the Weirwood tree and there is a short reunion scene between Jon, Bran and Benjen, who haven't seen each other in ages.

* On the way back, however, the party gets ambushed by the White Walkers; some of the sledge dogs get killed (including Ghost. RIP.) and Thoros is injured. However, they succesfully protect the sledge carrying Bran, Meera and Gendry, which escapes back to the wall. The team is trapped on the island just like the real show.

* Upon arriving back at the wall, Bran informs Dany that Jon &amp; co are alive but trapped. Dany ignores Tyrion's warnings and flies off to rescue them. 

* The battle is pretty similar except that 1) there are no fake-out deaths: when Tormund goes down under the wights, that's it; he dies. 2) Vyserion is shot down when he is right above the Night King about to breathe fire on him, not the other side of the battle field. This explains why the Night King went for him and not Drogon. 3) Jon doesn't fall into the ice because of brash stupidity, he falls into the ice as a result of a simple slip (some of the ice is melting due to dragonfire which is making it very slippery). Benjen jumps in and rescues him; Jon is now suffering from hypothermia and can't move properly. He escapes, not on Benjen's horse which has no realistic way out, but in Raegal's claws. Unfortunately, Benjen gets left behind and soon dies (Benjen cannot go south of the wall so sacrificing himself is the logical thing to do). 4) The battle ends with the Night King peering very intently at the spot where Vyserion died, with an evil glint in his eye.

* Awkward scenes of Bran interacting with people don't take place this season because there isn't time (they could still happen in season 8 though)

* The scene where Bran and Sam discuss Jon's parentage happens at Castle Black, not Winterfell.

* There is no scene where Vyserion gets fished out; the next we see of the Night King is when he is riding Vyserion and takes down the wall at Eastwatch.


#RIVERLANDS, NECK, BRIENNE, EDMURE, and BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS

* During the strategy meeting (where Jon decides to leave for Dragonstone), Littlefinger shares the knowledge that most of the Freys have mysteriously been killed and proposes that they rescue Edmure and install him as king of the Riverlands. This makes sense strategically since a) the main traderoute between the Eyrie and Winterfell passes through the Riverlands b) the Lannisters are going to be moving most of their troops south to fight Dany and the Frey soldiers are currently not being payed so there isn't likely going to be much resistance c) Littlefinger is still technically Lord of Harrenhall. However, Jon shoots down this suggestion, wanting to concentrate on the fight with the WWs.

* After Jon has left, Littlefinger decides to leave with the Knights of the Vale to rescue Edmure anyway. This mission is a complete success and there is barely a fight, as many of the remaining Lannisters prefer to simply surrender in exchange for their lives (morale is really low in the Lannister camp; people don't likes Cersei; no one wants to get roasted by a dragon; and the soldiers would rather go home than fight to hold the Riverlands). The Riverlords and Edmure thank Littlefinger and promise to help him. This section shows that there is at least someone who cares that all the Freys are dead instead of everyone in the show ignoring it.

* The Brotherhood without Banners stops by Winterfell on their way to the wall to take the Black, to rest and stock up on provisions. The Hound is reticent but Thoros and Beric knew Ned a long time ago, and convince they him otherwise. However, it turns out the Hound was correct, because Brienne recognises him while the only thing the others are known for is banditery so they get arrested and locked up.

* Arya arrives at Winterfell soon after. After her reunion scene with Sansa, Arya learns of the Brotherhood without Banners and has them released from prison. The Brienne/Hound interaction happens here instead of at King's Landing and Arya is present for it. The Brotherhood then leave for the wall.

* At some point after this, Sansa sends Brienne and Pod get sent off to the neck to find Howland Reed (who no one has seen in ages). There is an intermediate scene where Brienne and Pod find some clues, then a scene where Brienne and Pod actually find Greywater Watch and meet Howland Reed. [that character should really be introduced now; the very last season feels way too late to be introducing new characters critical to the plot]

* Brienne, Pod and Howland travel north but come across a Greyjoy ship moored in the fens and a small ironborn camp. Howland wants to investigate this potential threat. They manage to stealthily capture a random sailor and interogate him away from the camp. They discover that Euron sent them here for a secret mission in coordination with an anonymous ""friend from the Vale""; they also learn that the ship stopped by Baelish Keep on the way here. They decide to hurry back to Winterfell to relay this information.

#WINTERFELL, VALE, SANSA, LITTLEFINGER and VARYS

OK, I'll be honest: the Winterfell plotline in season 7 was so bad it's not even salvageable with small changes and additions. I'm deleting the entire thing and starting from scratch. So for this section, instead of keeping scenes by default and only talking about scenes I'm deleting or changeing, I'm instead going to be removing them by default and only say if they're still in. Notable changes are the absence of Bran (whose omniscience makes any plotting stupid), Arya acting like Arya instead of threatening Sansa for no reason and Littlefinger having actual plans he can work on instead of just being creepy around Sansa. 

* Keep the scene at the start where Jon decides not to punish the Umbar + Karstark children and the later argument with Sansa about it.

* Sansa meets with Littlefinger to discuss some ""deal"" they made that now has a ""problem"". Littlefinger reassures Sansa that he will fix the problem and Sansa doesn't have to do anything for now. Sansa looks suspicious at this and Littlefinger adds that ""it won't be a murder"" which seems to satisfy Sansa and she agrees.

* [Littlefinger goes off to the Riverlands and the Brotherhood without banners comes to Winterfell; see previous section] Once that's over, the situation is Littlefinger and Arya back in Winterfell, and Brienne has left to find Howland.

* Keep the scene where Sansa deals with the northern lords complaining at Jon's absence and wishing they had made Sansa queen instead of Jon. One big difference is that a raven arrives from ""Davos"" informing them that Jon has been captured by Daenarys and not to trust any future message sent by Jon [spoiler: this is actully a lie sent by Littlefinger]. The Northern Lords treat this as a declaration of war and discuss what to do about this new threat; there is much bemoaning of northern kings always going south and getting killed or captured. The results are inconclusive: no one wants to actually send any troops south to fight Daenarys but they do what to avoid a ""Blackfish"" scenario. Making Sansa queen is suggested and Littlefinger encourages this option but the Northern Lords don't fully agree yet.

* In a secret meeting with Arya and Royce, Sansa proposes a marriage between Arya and Robin to strengthen the alliance between the Vale and the North. Royce is enthusiastic but Arya rejects it. There is an argument between Sansa and Arya on this topic. 

* Arya goes to Littlefinger for help. He thanks her for the information and agrees to block the marriage. He reassures Arya that the Vale will remain allied to the North: no marriage necessary. He also asks Arya a few question about her relationship to the faceless men... With her skills, she could be very useful to the North...

* Sansa tells Arya off for blabbing to Littlefinger. This scene contains a lot of exposition so the audience can understand what is going on. Sansa explains all the stuff Littlefinger has done (that she knows of: killing Lysa, giving her to the Boltons,...) and why she doesn't trust him. She also explains that she made a deal with Littlefinger to support his bid for the Iron Throne in exchange for her becoming warden of the north [the ""problem"" discussed earlier is that Jon is currently king of the north, not her]. Finally she explains that a marriage between Arya and Robin would help undermine Littlefinger. Arya reiterates that she won't marry Robin and offers to simply assassinate Littlefinger but Sansa rejects this on the grounds that they'll lose the alliance with the Vale. 

* Littlefinger confronts Sansa about her trying to arrange a marriage behind his back. Sansa apologises and feigns ignorance. Littlefinger demands that Sansa no longer interfere with Robin and warns her that if she tries anything else, that she will lose everything they've been working towards. He has invested a lot into Sansa and doesn't want it all to go to waste.

* Littlefinger informs the northern court that Jon has finally broken, and bent the knee to Daenarys. Sansa confirms having received a raven from King's Landing with the same information and Lord Manderley goes further and tells everyone that he saw Dany with Jon at Ramsgate. The northern lords are all extremely angry and immediately name Sansa queen of the North instead of Jon (with Littlefinger's encouragement). They start planning ways to kill Dany, noting that Dany currently only has her dragons protecting her at the moment and that her army is still in the south...

* A wagon carrying dragonglass arrives at Winterfell. At night, Sansa goes to check it out alone; she looks around to check she really is alone and does a special knock. A secret compartment opens and she finds Davos and Varys hidden inside; they have just smuggled themselves in. She thanks them for coming and asks whether anyone noticed them on the road, to which they say no. Varys says they have ""work to do"".

* Arya goes to see Littlefinger again (despite her sister's earlier warnings). She is worried about what will happen to Jon now. Littlefinger explains that Jon has likely fallen in love with Daenarys and that if Jon continues to follow Daenarys, he will likely be exiled and never allowed in the North again. Littlefinger suggests that if Daenarys were to... mysteriously die... then all the problem would be sorted. He mentions that all the Northern Lords are currently trying to think up ways of doing it. He gives her the catspaw dagger and suggests that Cersei might be a good person to frame.

* Near the end of the season, Littlefinger walks into the Great Hall of Winterfell, sees Varys is there, looks very shocked, and promptly gets surrounded by Stark men and arrested. He asks how Varys got there without him knowing about it but Varys refuses to say.

* Trial scene for Littlefinger! The judges are Sansa, Varys and Royce. The Lords of the North and Vale watch intently. Witnesses are 1) Davos, who reveals that he never sent that message telling people that Jon was captured and in fact, Jon was given free access to the dragonglass mines. Thus, when Jon bent the knee to Daenarys, it was of his own free will and the message was a fake. 2) Brienne and Howland, who reveal the information about the Ironborn in the Fens who stopped by at Baelish keep 3) Arya, who reveals that Littlefinger was trying to get her to kill Daenarys. In my version, Littlefinger has an actual defence: he says that anyone could have sent the fake letter, that the Ironborn can't be trusted to tell the truth, and that the assassination of Daenarys is perfectly legal since the North is currently at war with Daenarys. So far, it seems that none of the charges are sticking; Littlefinger is too good at defending himself.

Varys invites a 4th witness in [the suspicious guy from Ramsgate], who claims to have been hired by Littlefinger to wait at Ramsgate and kill Davos if he ever arrived but that he failed. This is a crushing piece of evidence for Littlefinger. At this he switches defence, claiming that Sansa and Varys are trying to frame him. Littlefinger talks about their enmity in King's Landing, to which Varys retorts by mentioning the role he played in Ned Stark's imprisonment. Most people in the audience by now seem convinced that it was in fact Littlefinger who sent the fake message, because why else would he try to kill Davos?

Littlefinger claims that he's actually been working for Sansa this entire time and that she's getting rid of him now that she has what she wants - being Queen of the North. He explains how he first saved Sansa from King's Landing, then covered for Sansa when she killed Lysa (Sansa exclaims that is a lie and that Littlefinger was the one who killed Lysa) and then helped her take back Winterfell. He produces a document Sansa signed before the Battle of the Bastards where she agreed loyalty to Littlefinger if she could be Warden of the North. He explains how Sansa didn't like Jon being king and so asked him for help and he did. Now that she is queen she is trying to get rid of him so that she doesn't have to fulfill her side of the bargain. At this point, it seems that Littlefinger is falling but he's dragging Sansa with him: Sansa looks guilty as fuck.

Sansa's reply takes Littlefinger by surprise. She claims she isn't queen. Her appointment was made only a result of deceit of the northern lords and therefore she does not recognise it. Jon is still the King in the North and she's loyal to him and has no desire of overthrowing him. This is all on Littlefinger. If she really was conspiring with Littlefinger to become queen in the North, then why would she work with Varys, representative of Daenarys, who is also claiming the North? And also give up her claim to Jon when she could easily have taken it?

Varys explains that what is really going on is that, since Jon is King and Jon bent the knee to Daenarys, that means that Daenarys is now ruler of the North. So now Littlefinger trying to stir up war between the North and Daenarys, as well as trying to assassinate her, are treasonous, and it makes perfect sense for Sansa to bring in a representative of Daenarys to enact justice on a traitor to Daenarys.

Royce asks Sansa about Lysa, and she again explains that Littlefinger was the one who killed her, and she only lied in the previous trial to cover for him. Varys says that he knew both Sansa and Littlefinger at King's Landing and killing Lysa is exactly the type of the thing Littlefinger would do but not the type of thing Sansa would do. And they have just seen a lot of evidence of Littlefinger being slimy. Royce is still suspicious but drops the topic. 

Littlefinger demands trial by combat. The judges say that he cannot use a proxi - he must fight himself, and it must take place immediately. He is given a sword and Arya volunteers to be his opponent. Littlefinger is terrible at fighting; Arya stabs him with the Catspaw dagger and he dies.

[With these changes, Littlefinger is not defeated by an omniscient living plot device called Bran; he is instead defeated by the unexpected presence of Varys and his machinations in Winterfell. But more than that it was his misreading of Sansa that caused her to recruit Varys in the first place. Littlefinger assumed that Sansa was going after power and would therefore do what he asked of her so as to keep that power, but what Sansa really wanted was to defend her family. Littlefinger is of course very used to dealing with the power-hungry because that's pretty much everyone in King's Landing. But he is not prepared for someone who just gives up power like what Sansa did.]


#SEASON 8

You might be wondering what was all that about the Ironborn in the neck? Well, that will have a payoff in season 8. 

* As the Dothraki are travelling north through the riverlands, they are joined by Edmure, the riverlords, and a translator from Essos, who was apparently hired by Littlefinger. Edmure (through the translator) explains that Littlefinger has a plan to get them out of this mess. Littlefinger has managed to arrange passage for them back to Essos so that they won't have to fi	ght the army of the dead and so that they can be free of Dany's tyranny. He also talks about a deal Littlefinger made with the Lords of Braavos to guarentee their safety from Dany's dragons: they won't get burnt by them. (Braavos is of course famous for managing to remain independent of the dragonlords of Old Valyria so there could be something there.) Many of the Dothraki seem interested; they really dislike Daenarys and are only following her because they have no choice. They don't want to fight the dead and would much rather go back to Essos and stay out of this mess. And don't like being treated like simple mercenaries: a Khal should ride with his khalasar. 

* When the Dothraki+riverlords get to the neck, they are greeted by Euron, who explains he has the ships ready to take them over to Braavos. He says that Littlefinger is dead but they can still go through with the plan. Many of the Dothraki go with Euron, and only a small group of hardcore Dany-loyalists continue north.

* While out at sea, Euron orders that the ships carrying the Dothraki be set on fire. The deal with Braavos was a lie. The Dothraki can neither swim nor sail and they all drown, and those few clinging to wreckage get shot by the Ironborn. The Ironborn who were sailing the now burning ships CAN swim and aren't getting shot so they just get onto other boats.",31,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

From Wiki of Ice and Fire: ""Ancient traditions proclaim that when a khal dies, his bloodriders die with him. Should the khal die in battle, the bloodriders live only long enough to avenge him.""

In uniting every khalasar and naming them all bloodriders, Daenerys ensures that when she dies, it's the duty of every Dothraki in her army to fall on their own sword. Given the Dothraki's reluctance to travel by ship and succession rules based on strength, they could have terrorized Westeros when Daenerys dies.

Bran visits the past to find out more about Beric. Sees him at the point of his first death. What if Bran is somehow responsible for bringing him back.
Bran discovers his ability to communicate through the past and realizes he is the Lord of Light.

Brans abilities to bring people back to life only work if he is called to for help, as Thoros does for Beric and Melisandre for Jon.

Who else has the ability to bring people back to life...the Night King.

Yes. What if Bran ventures too far with his powers and does indeed get trapped. He becomes too ambitious. 
Or realizes that he is the Night King through other means, and knows what he has to do. 
What if its his destiny and his powers take him to the moment of the Night Kings creation involuntarily.

I have already thought the Night King has green sight like Bran in that he can see the past and present.
I believe the whole Beyond the Wall episode was a trap to lure Daenerys out so that he could kill the dragon. He had spears ready. If he had the sight he would know whats going on in Westeros as he would be able to see through visions. He would know of Jon and Daeneryss connection and of there plan. Why else did Jon and the crew manage to capture that wight so easily. When that white walker died, all the wights it had turned died too. But conveniently there was one that didnt die. One that had been turned by a different white walker that was deliberately handed over to them. 
 The White Walkers not only wait out until the lake has fully frozen over...they are waiting for the dragons. And the Night King can see clearly that Daenerys is coming to help.
Soo. The night king does have a goal that isnt just to kill everyone. What could it be?

Well. The Night King could be Bran. Trying to save Westeros? Crossing the wall and building an army that will help Jon claim the throne. 
I like the idea that the Night King is heading to the isle of faces where there may still be living children of the forest who can turn him back. Or free Bran from being trapped within the Night King.

To me, this paints a picture of Arya playing the part of one of the Children and driving a piece of dragonglass into Jon's heart. For what purpose? If Jon is the key to making some sort of new truce/pact/peace (as I speculate), perhaps he needs to be on the side of the dead to do so.

In  season 1/book 1, Jon almost abandons the Night's Watch after having  taken his oath to join Robb's war. He was willing to abandon his duty to  avenge his father and help his brother. His friends stop him, ofcourse,  but what if they hadn't?

What  if Jon had made it back to Robb? Would Robb have welcomed him with open  arms because he could've desperately used all the emotional support he  could? Or would he have regretfully executed him for desertion? Is there  a third option here I'm missing?

How  do you think Catelyn would've reacted? No doubt she wouldn't have been  happy to see on again - but what about beyond that? Would she have  grudgingly acknowledged that the boy truly does love his family? Would  she have been happy to finally get an opportunity to get rid of him for  good?

Yoren comes to ask Ned for Night's Watch recruits and to tell him that his wife has captured Tyrion. The part I found odd is that Ned asks Yoren if Benjen had sent him and almost looks relieved when he finds out that Benjen did not send him and the original reason for his visit. See below transcript but it really helps to see Ned's face (S1E5 around 27:35 mark)

N: Your name, friend?
Y: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
A: Im a girl!
N: Did Benjen send you?
Y: No one sent me, my lord. Im here to find men for the Wall, see if theres any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
N: Oh, well find recruits for you.
Y: Thank you, my lord.

Possible explanations I had for this was that Ned could just be thinking about something going wrong at the wall (deserters/whitewalkers etc) or something else. Ned has also been worried about the Lannisters and other things happening to his family (Bran) so he might just have that on his mind. 

Also the last time Ned saw Benjen was when he told Jon that the next time they see each other he would tell him about his mother. I still don't think Benjen knows about Jon's true parents but this made me rethink that maybe there is something more going on between Ned and Benjen.

So any explanations? Why would Ned think that Yoren was sent by Benjen (other than the fact that he is in the Night's Watch)? And if he did think that, why would that be a bad thing (assuming he actually is relieved in this scene)? Or am I just overthinking this scene in preparation of the new season lol - any thoughts would be appreciated.",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now, I've never really given the theory that Tyrion is actually the son of the Mad King with Joanna Lannister much benefit of the doubt. Tywin's inability to accept his son as his own is of course an interesting dynamic, but this line got me thinking. I only ever see people talk about the incident on Tywin's wedding day and the infamous ""you're no son of mine"" line, but never this one. What I find interesting about it (assuming Tyrion is the Mad King's son) is that Tywin shows a few parallels to what Ned said to Jon. Specifically how he chose the words ""brought you up as my son"" and ""because you're a Lannister"". Even if the Mad King had raped Joanna, she was still Tywin's cousin (weird incest double standard there) and Tyrion would still be a Lannister. Only because Tyrion is a Lannister does Tywin spare him, and in this case, despite the painful memories of not only being the cause of death of his wife, but also as a reminder of what happened to her. It's (strenuously) similar to Ned taking in Jon and [assuring him that he is a Stark](https://youtu.be/diZPm20DdLM?t=9), as he is at least Lyanna's son.

Now, whether George has this in the cards or not, I think it unlikely for D&amp;D to follow this specific thread in the show. Still, it's not as unreasonable as I previously thought",29,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Rickon was grown and looked older than Geoffrey when he died. When Rickon is killed in episode 10 of season 6 by Ramsey Bolton its probably the dumbest death weve seen through the series. He has to run to Jon, which he is about half a mile away, while Ramsey shoots arrows. 

Literally all he had to do to survive was move either to the left or the right to try and move away from the arrow. I was cussing at my tv when I saw the arrow go through his eye. Ramsey cant be that good of a shot to hit a moving sprinting target since weve only see him use a blade up until this episode. 

Even though he is the youngest son doesnt mean he has to be the worst Stark just some of his actions make him the that.

At first I thought this maybe symbolizes Arya being far gone from whom she once was and her stark Heritage especially since she doesnt pass a tomb/statue, and while I think that is the case still I have heard some people say it could be a secret passage way through the Crypts like a tunnel. Its possible there could be secret passages and exits through the Crypts and I dont think weve seen an area of the crypts like this before. Some think these are the Secret exit at Riverrun but I dont think thats the case since I wouldnt make sense to have one part at Riverrun and then the rest is at Winterfell so I think this tunnel is in winterfell. So could this be that Arya is walking through Tunnels and so is it foreshadowing that Arya will help evacuate some citizens of WF through secret tunnels in the crypts and maybe even help the citizens of KL evacuateWell KL? I think it could be, but like I said I also believe that Arya not walking pass a tomb/statue in the Crypts could be symbolizes how far gone she is from the Arya we knew, and her Stark heritage in general. But I think that could/will change next season, as I think her arc next season will be fully re-gaining her humanity and re-socialization and having a possible romance with Gendry, and maybe saving people in WF and/or KL could be part of that.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

For certain characters this is relatively obvious, Dany will try and rule the Seven kingdoms, Jon will try to save them, Cersai will try to undermine everything and Arya will use her skills to kill people who need to be killed. For others it is less obvious, what impact will Jaime and Tyrion have and, the point of this post, what will Sansa do?

On the surface of it season 7 left Sansa with little on her plate, shes not a warrior or strategist so she cant really help against the NK, she was in command of Winterfell but she was keeping the seat warm for Jon, she had defeated Littlefinger and had fixed her relationship with Arya. The only issue unresolved was her desire to rule the North, this wasnt something stated, but certainly hinted at. That could suggest that Sansa will undermine Jon at some stage and, potentially, screw everything up for everyone but I have a different idea.

Sansa has spent the last 7 seasons becoming the anti-Stark, shes cynical, calculating and cautious where the Starks have been shown to be bold, trusting and honourable, the thing is that this regularly gets them killed, it happened to Ned, then Robb and finally Jon (he got better). I think it will be Sansas role to save the day, to see the threat before everyone else does and act decisively, in short, I think Sansa will see straight through Danaerys. 

This could be a whole other post but the perception of Dany as a good and just ruler isnt born out of what weve seen on the screen. Shes conquered and murdered her way across the world and her Break the Wheel shtick is meaningless populism, theres nothing to separate her from any other power-hungry potential ruler. The male characters that follow her, Jorah, Varys, Tyrion, Baristan, Daario and Jon, cant see this, they see the beautiful young girl who commands dragons and assume she is innocent, Sansa wont fall for that.

Weve already seen this, she was wary of Dany in S7 and the shade in her voice when she tells Dany that Winterfell is hers is frosty. I believe she will oppose Dany from the start warning that she is not to be trusted, she will argue with Jon about her to no avail but, when the time comes, it will be Dany that stands up to her (quite possibly with Arya and Brienne at her side), it will be her standout moment that marks the completion of her arc, that she is no longer a victim, she is a true Stark and worthy of taking the mantel Lady of Winterfell.

Disclaimer  Im aware I may be wrong about Dany, that she may well not become an antagonist but my view is go big or go home. Im also aware that Im probably biased, Sansa is my favourite character and Id love it if she got to be an amazing badass that wins the day. Still, its fun to speculate.    ",57,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

 I seen a post last year that set me off thinking about the nature of the God's of Planetos, I do not think that this world is really being governed by the rules of a deity or deities. Here are my thoughtsL 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Old Gods**

* The Old Gods are one of the religions in my eyes that are shown to have real power. The God's are meant to inhabit the trees, talk through the trees and as Theon says the Old Gods have no power in the south due to the lack of Weirwoods. However we know that the voices and the powers of the old Gods are that off the Greenseers who have woven their powers through the trees. These greenseers are linked to the Children of the Forest, the Wargs and other magical forces beyond the wall. **These are the only 'Gods' that we have proof exist** and in that line of thinking we also know that they do no exist as 'Gods' but powerful humans. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Staying North of the Wall, this is not so much a religion but a real power and as it follows on well from the Old God's I will mention them next, the White Walkers. In the book we hear of the Great Other, in the show we have the Night King, the embodiment of death and the leader of the White Walkers who obviously has powers as he has displayed them many times by now such as his QB throw with an ice spear, apparent Greensight and the great power of reanimation. This is the antagonist power of the show with the eternal link to ice, the weapon of the Children gone wrong or whatever other explanation the show will give. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The Seven - these God's seem to me as the least powerful of any God on the show and are really just interpretation of real world feelings, they match up with a lot of other polytheist religions of the ancient world in the way they are representations of fertility, war, death and other common real world issues. They are like the Roman Gods who are praised in the same style as the Christian real world God.

&amp;#x200B;

* In this series where there is ice there must surely be fire, so I will go next to the mysterious God who has never appeared, has no real world representation except his priests but has shown actual true powers to exist, R'hllor. What do we know about the Lord of Light or from here on in LOL, well we know that he has priests who are enacting his work some of whom are powerless but some who seem to posses real power. Looking at his two main priests firstly with Thoros of Myr, we know that Thoros brought Beric back from the dead and in the books Beric was able to pass this life on to Lady Stoneheart but let's deal with the show for now. Melisandre is our foremost character who is linked to the LOL, the Lord has brought her to Westeros to help make way for the Prince that Was Promised. We know that Mel works of visions and voices from her Lord that aren't always easy to follow e.g. the Stannis fuck up, however the important thing to note is that she knew to tell Stannis that his goal was not only the throne but to travel North and help fight the wildlings and then to take back Winterfell so that the North was united. The most notable moment of Mel's is without doubt bringing Jon back from the dead, we know that she has no real power but for whatever reason she was able to bring Jon back from the dead, but how? Why? How can these two powerless priests be so special. My answer to that links heavily with GRRM stating that Jon and Beric (therefore LSH also) are fire wights. Now this was very specific terminology, he makes it clear that they are wights just like the what the army of the Night King or Great Other is filled with but these ones are fire wights, the army of the living. This clearly identifies the LOL as the opposite to the NK, he has made moves to counter the White Walkers, who else does that? **Bran Stark**.

Looking at some other characters who have had interactions with the Lord of Light or his priests/esses, The Hound seen the arrow head mountain which was pivotal in the story, he travelled there with the Brotherhood (Thoros &amp; Beric), these men wen to the arrow head mountian with Jon who was already in high regard with the LOL and Gendry who is another one of our characters to experience the LOL. Varys heard something in the fire that changed his life forever, we are not sure what it was that was said but we do know that he played a huge part in Dany being fully equipped to take over Westeros, however it is clear that her main purpose for now is to fight the White Walkers and without her the living would fail so it seems that Varys life goal has coincidentally put a huge army in the North in time for the NK invasion, I am not saying that was Varys true goal but the voice that spoke to him, possibly (I will leave out mention of Aegon for the most part, but again a representation of fire). Stannis saved Jon Snow's life and made sure the wall would be defended a while longer so even though he was not our saviour he played a huge role in helping Jon. We also know the Mad King heard voices who many speculate is Bran and they were tied to fire, ""burn them all"". Arya, Tyrion, Euron (in the books), Sam, Brienne and others also experience the Lord of Light in their own minor ways, all of which are in the right place at the right time for the Great War. One more point on this is that Jon, Arya, Brienne and Sam are all in the North with Valyrian Steel. Jon is obviously essential to the LOL whether he likes it or not, Jon is seemingly our hero and the one man actively trying to turn everyone's attention away from petty bullshit and towards the Night King, he brought Wildings South, encountered the Night King, Took Winterfell and United the North and added 3 dragons to his cause and the Dragon Queen. This level of dedication to the fight against the WW is unseen in any character and in any God, except Bran and the Old God's.

For me this is too coincidental that two powerful entities are working together to get the living ready for the dead, my counter argument and point of my theory is that they are not different they are the exact same and they are both Bran Stark interpreted in different ways. I believe Bran spoke in the flames to Varys, showed the Hound the arrow mountain, whispered to the Mad King and somehow brought Jon and Beric back from the dead.

So humour me for now and say I am right, that would mean through the old God's Bran has been able to travel through time and whisper to people and as we know he can change time in certain ways. I theorise that Bran knows this and he knows how things must be for the living to win. He needed someone to help the dragon queen get to Westeros, he needed the Son of Rhaegar and Lyanna to be the PTWP and do all the things Jon did, he needed the 7 to go beyond the wall (for whatever reason I will let DnD answer that), he seemingly needs the VS weapons to be in the North and in the hands of certain characters. My thoughts are that Bran is the main power in this world, he as the most powerful Greenseer is the champion of the Living against the dead, his nemesis the Night King or as the books say the Great Other. Azor Ahai is the champion of the LOL to fight the Great Other, just as Jon is the champion of Bran to defeat the Night King. Bran I believe is one and the same with the Old Gods and R'hallor and that R'hallor is an interpretation of humans of the signs and voices which Bran (or maybe greenseers preparing the way for him) which has been thought of as the work of a God or in the Mad King's case thought of as just madness.

If we keep with the notion that **Bran has acted through the disguise of the God's to influence people** then we can look towards another God and another plot left unresolved. The Many Faced God. The many faced God even sounds to me like recognition of a higher power that acts through the world which has been called many things i.e. many faced. So if the many faced God spoke to Jaqen and told him where to go and how to act then it's feasible that he must go to Westeros, find Arya Stark, train her, then let her go back to Westeros. In Westeros Arya then receives a Valyrian steel dagger from Bran, so Bran now has a trained assassin who holds a Valyrian steel dagger, one which he can get her to use to kill the Night King and therefore end the Long Night.

&amp;#x200B;

My one hold up is that we do not know if greenseers can see the past but we are not fully sure if they can see the future. According to the books and even the wiki [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Greenseer](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Greenseer) they can. So even though we aren't sure of Bran seeing the future just yet, we do know others have been able to and if Bran is more powerful than others before him they why should he be any less able to see the future. 

I will also add that I do not believe Bran created the Lord of Light or any of these religions, they were already there. However he did use religious people to help further his agenda as he knew he could talk with them and they wouldn't go mad. For example he may have sent the mad king crazy, but he knows if he uses someone like Mel she will think it is divine power. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are a lot of details to iron out, a lot of source work I can still work through and lot's more welcome criticsm before I can ever consider this a true theory. But I want to put this out there first and see how it is picked up by some of yourselves and I welcome you all to pick it apart and question it because that is the only way I will know myself if this holds any water. I will defend my theory where I can but am open minded to criticism and basically want to see if I am on to something or else just having major withdrawal. Thanks for reading.

TL:DR - Bran Stark has been going through time to show signs, speak to people and move the chess pieces to ensure the living are ready to fight and beat the dead. These signs and voices etc. have been interpreted by humans as the works of God's, essentially making Bran the Old Gods and the New, the Lord of Light and the Many Faced God in his bid to defeat the Night King and ensure the survival of the living.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If not let me know and I'll take it down. Im super excited for this new season as Im sure everyone is.

Ok so I know a big theory here is that Bran is the night king, since the trailer doesnt show bran at all. But since it shows that the night king will reach Winterfell, does that mean that we might see Ned come back as a white walker?  We know &gt;!Ned was buried in the crypts because Catelyn got his body or just his head!&lt;.

This may be a stupid theory, but it would be cool to see him again and I have a feeling we will, maybe not by him being a white walker but &gt;!he could have been swapped with a faceless man at his execution or the lord of light used magic to switch appearances (like the king beyond the wall did in the books I believe).!&lt;

Again, if this isnt the right place to post this let me know",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
2558,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-18,2019,1,18,5,ah1z88,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] I think I have an idea who the next Night King might be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ah1z88/spoilers_i_think_i_have_an_idea_who_the_next/,whycuthair,1547756292,"I can't stop thinking about it. I'm watching some alt shift x and nerd soup and there's one thing no one's saying that's always on my mind. It is said that to stop the last night king, azor ahai sacrificed his loved one. Now everyone thinks that thus Jon will also have to sacrifice Daenerys. They said Azor Ahai had to put Light Bringer through his lover's heart to be able to stop him. But here's the thing! I don't think Light Bringer is a sword! No! I think it's dragon glass! Remember how the children of the forest created the Night King? Well Azor Ahai was also said to have asked the children of the forest how to stop him. So they tell him the most obvious reason. One must take his place! So it's not that Azor Ahai kills his love to be able to kill the night King but kills his love so she can become the Night Queen! Yes! The Night King is actually a Queen! Why I think this? Because when the first men had a deal with the white walkers, one of the conditions was that a Stark will always marry a dead queen! Also that sacrifices of babies will be made(remember Craster and his sons out if incests? I say incests because that is also relevant later).

So in the end, I got a case of beer that the solution Jon will find will be to have to sacrifice, even with her knowledge probably, Daenerys so she can become the Night Queen and control the whole hive mind. Because it was said she would never have any babies, she will demand babies to have for her. Because just as Jon, she would give her life for her people. She would still have Jon though, as per the old accords. She would even have her baby back. She would then help repair the Wall back, which let's face it, couldn't have been built without the help of the Night King, obviously.

The only fault in this is that Daenerys does not have warging capabilities. So my second choice, if not her would actually be their son. In order to end the war, Jon would sacrifice his own son, Targaryen with Stark blood, The Prince that was promised, who will take control of the dead.

However, why Craster's kids made sense to the Night King has something surely to do with Targaryens, and their preferance of keeping the line pure. One more reason to think the Night King might be a Night Queen. I mean look at Danny's eyes and look at Night Kings eyez. That blue &lt;3 Her son with Jon would then actually be the Prince that was promised. A mix of Ice and Fire, with Jon being the Fire here. (M.-Night-Shyamalaned!!!)

Bonus theory :Realising that fire is actually evil(can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'oll or what's his name and Melissandre are actually evil, like fucking Satan or something(so when she says that there is a fight between darkness and light, the light is actually the one coming from the dragon glass candle! Fire only brings death, and darkness and ash! That's why she saw her throne burning! Cersei might blow herself and the whole city up rather than giving it up, this time Jamie not being able to let himself kill her saying one more time ""The things I do for love"". Cersei also said she would kill the entire King's landing to keep her children safe. Perhaps Jamie might do the same. Or Tyrion, who has the experience and owes her a daughter). Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself, her faith resembling that of her dragon(dragons maybe, realising they are too dangerous, or maybe being able to be controlled by Melissandre, as beasts of hell), joining her baby. From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

One more bonus theory against the God of Fire:Some think the faceless men have been the one responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap. But Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that.. So if the faceless men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own? Deanerys would need ice dragons to fight them. No one knows how the doom came either. Perhaps also with dragons. And the god of death of the faceless men might just be the same god as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. Valar Morgulis, all men must die, said by ex slaves? By Faceless Men? By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria? Against the Targaryens?) When Beric looked on the other side, he only saw darkness..

2593,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-18,2019,1,18,8,ah3s3e,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] The actual fight between Ice and Fire is between light and darkness. But the darkness is actually what fire brings..,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ah3s3e/spoilers_the_actual_fight_between_ice_and_fire_is/,whycuthair,1547766286,"I just had a mind blowing moment while working on a different theory. Just realised that the true enemies have been hidden all along. It isn't the Night King. What he is doing is actually trying to save the world! I am mostly talking about stuff that happened in the books here though, just as a disclaimer. My whole idea starts from this. You know how Melissandre always says the night is dark and full of terrors? How only light can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(dragon) glass. That is the only eternal flame. The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! Just thing about it. Fire burns everything to ash, leaving nothing behind. The Night King has no choice but to fight the fire that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that with ice, with people who's hearts cannot be tricked by wizards, very light creatures, you could say. 

Remember how the witch had told Danny she would never have other sons? What rituals she did to Khal Drogo? She wasn't lying. Khal Drogo's life paid for the life of Danny's dragons, but they are not her babies. They are tools for the red priests, and they have  controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'holl or what's his name and Melissandre are actually evil, like fucking Satan or something Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire is, and the power of R'hlor, her faith resembling that of her dragon(dragons maybe, realising they are too dangerous, or having them turned against her by Melissandre and R'hllor, or the faceless men and the God of Death(Valyria all over again?), joining her baby dragon, her baby Drogo. From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the faceless men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong.  Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from reconquering the world!



For further proof... when Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth.

What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. Who, from those who have not seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and are used later by Qyburn to kill Pycelle. Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar escape, knowing he'd kill his brother, sister, who knows who..So the red priests might have been grooming Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution. I mean, if he cared about the people why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning one? Because he was the one whispering in his years to do it! She would have then to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebbellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing.

As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. Valar Morgulis, all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was Syrio Forel(Jagen?) who must have been sent to turn a Stark(Arya) into their own assassin, but instead cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances! Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When Beric looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a shadow. That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false gods. Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, and his name is death, Jaagen would say. So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the white walkers! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria work against the ones fighting on the Ice side.  So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the queen of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, taking the Night King's place, who up until then was manipulated by fire. But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities, maybe Jon(Or even Bran himself, who looks the most like the NK face-wise)? Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the evil men(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light. 

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Prince that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of Dornish origins, passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. 

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. But I see the books going a different way, if they ever finish.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

They are tools for the red priests, and they have controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'holl or what's his name and Melissandre are actually evil, like fucking Satan or something Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire is, and the power of R'hlor, her faith resembling that of her dragon(dragons maybe, realising they are too dangerous, or having them turned against her by Melissandre and R'hllor, or the faceless men and the God of Death(Valyria all over again?), joining her baby dragon, her baby Drogo. From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the faceless men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from reconquering the world!

What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. Who, from those who have seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and are used later by Qyburn to kill Pycelle. Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar escape, knowing he'd kill his brother, sister, who knows who..So the red priests might have been grooming Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution. I mean, if he cared about the people why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city, which, again, probably didn't count on Jamie Lannister to actually step in to save the day. (The things he did for love, even then!) Because he was the one whispering in the Mad King ears to do it! There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least know to try and save the Targaryen kids. He did none of that. Remember the Tragedy at Summerhall? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish. The only ones who survived where the ones saved by the Lord Comman, from the King's guard. 

She would have then to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebbellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing. 



As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. Valar Morgulis, all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was Syrio Forel(Jagen?) who must have been sent to turn a Stark(Arya) into their own assassin, but instead cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances! Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When Beric looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a shadow. That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false gods. Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, and his name is death, Jaagen would say. So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the white walkers! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria work against the ones fighting on the Ice side. So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the queen of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, taking the Night King's place, who up until then was manipulated by fire. But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities, maybe Jon(Or even Bran himself, who looks the most like the NK face-wise)? Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the evil men(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light.

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Prince that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of Dornish origins, passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. The dragon, to quote Rhaegar, has three heads however. So in the books you will have Jon, Danny and the first Aegon to fight against the three heads of the beast that R'hllor uses to bring doom to the world. Almost like Cerberus..

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. Then Bran take the Night King place to represent the Ice dragon..



Edit 1: You can also  see why Varys is a red priest when he meets Melissandre on the cliff. They talk as if they were some old friends. She calls him ""dear spider"" and he calls her ""my Lady"".He tells her [**You begged us to summon the King in the North**](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8)  ""Don't you want to see him again?""  **YES! SUMMON FROM THE DEAD!!!**   ""I have done my part!"" She mentions something about her mission being done, but he makes a comment that once a common man has a taste of the good life he will not just leave it like that! She replies to him that neither of them are common men any more, and they both smile. Might be that it was her who was the witch that cut off his penis too. After all, that old guy in the crate, if you remember, had his mouth sewn shut, he couldn't even say his side of the story! My guess is that the guy was probably someone he kept so he could use for his flames! I mean, what happens to that crate? Why was he carrying him around? Then he has Tyrion in a simmilar crate. His new lab rat....... ANYWAY.... Then Varys warns Melissandre to leave Westeros, knowing what it is to come(he has seen it in the flames), but she surprises him by telling that they will both die there, something he has not seen, which disappoints him, since that sweet life he had that he paid R'hllor with is soul for was coming to an end. Not to mention that Varys look pretty young even though we know he was there during the Mad King reign as well. Maybe under those silk robes he is hiding a necklace just like Melissandre's!

Edit 2: 
For further proof of the red priests involvement in the Targaryen lives. When Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth. Ilyrio sold her to Khal Drogo and gave her the dragon eggs that would help bring the doom upon Westeros again. Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called The Tragedy at Summerhall. *""the blood of the dragon gathered in one 
 seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned 
 pyromancers 
 wild fire 
 flames grew out of control  towering  burned so hot that 
 died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman,,,""* How fortunate that the dragon eggs would end up in Illyrio Mopatis's hand, Varys's friend! The spider who played with fire.

Valar Morgulis????,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ah6uht/no_spoilers_dear_grrm_dd_thank_you_for_valar/,Boogerpicker247364,1547786543,"I'm aware this probably isnt the standard GoT type post, and, well, just grant a dying man this wish.
 
 

For the past 7 years I have been bound to a bed and suffering a painful and slow death. And through this experience of fighting off the one true god with my ""NOT TODAY"" mindset, I have watched the series countless times. (Tried the books multiple times, but impossible to maintain focus needed to immerse myself into them.)
 
 
In this time I have realized that others fear death far more than I do. So I ended up pushing others away.. (The ones that I could tell were suffering deeply upon looking at the person who they felt would ""never die"" , or ""immune to physical pain"" ,as I was later told by several of my friends.) 
 
 
So a few months ago I got a group text from 7 friends I had pushed away around 6 years ago. The text simply said, ""Valar Morgulis"" with pictures of us from earlier years. (I'm 42 now, fell ill at 29, but no one knew (including myself) until I was 35 after losing function of left arm &amp; leg.)
 
 
Upon recieving this message, without thinking, I responded with ""Valar Dohaeris "" . 
 
 

That led to getting my old friends I pushed away to come visit me. This time, when they smiled, their eyes did not reveal the sadness they once did . They were genuinely happy. After an hour or so (All I could handle.) I had to cut our time short. But I said ""If I dont make it to this final season, enjoy it as if I was there."" and it was waterworks mania after that. A good cry was had by all of us. And then one of my oldest friends said ""If you go before Season 8, you will be there even if we have to dig up your body and paint you up to look like a White Walker! (Lol ensued) And while you were once physically as big as The Mountain, we have already spoken and agreed that we wont Qybern(sp?) you even if it were possible. So make sure you wear a lot of deodorant on your last day."" 

 
 
It may seem trivial and not relevant to this reddit page, but GoT hasn't just helped me get through these past 7 years. It has given me back the friends I love in the final times. 
 
 
So thank you for ""Valar Morgulis"". It means more to me than I think it does to anyone. (And I might just be the biggest GoT fan ever based upon how many times I've watched the series.) I hope I can make to, and through, season 8. If not, then I will try to make that last dream one that plays out season 8 for what feels like eternity, in those final seconds.
 

Thank you, 
Matt
 
 
(Hope this made sense. My mental strength is not what it once was. Tried to keep it as short as possible and grammatically correct as best I could.)
 
 
PS ... If anyone has any pull ""in the biz"", can you ask Jason Momoa to play the role of ""vegetated Khal Drogo"" and see if he will just sit at my funeral with that 1000 yard stare? That would really mindf*ck everyone else there.",19,1,False,self,,,,,

I can't be the only who thinks this is one of the best scenes in the show. Tyrion's entire character and story arc encapsulated in five minutes. This scene questions the purpose of the senseless brutality of the men in Westeros through Tyrion's probing of his dumb cousin's relentless killing of beetles with seemingly no perceived motivation. He tries to find a reason for Orson's violence, and in failing to find one, posits the question to Jaime who has no answer other than ""it's the way the world works"" (every day hundreds of people die by the score). He cannot find reason behind such vicious behavior, much like how he could not find reason behind his father's contemptuous treatment (and most members of his family and the rest of Westeros society). In this entire scene, he gradually becomes more desperate in his attempt to find a reason; to him the brutal killings and vicious nature (deciding the fate of men by having two men hack each other apart) of Westeros men is not, or should not, be the norm. He lets the beetle he grasped live exemplifying his already known compassion that is perfectly contrasted to Jaime's ""that's just the way it is"" (good luck today) which more closely resembles the mentality of the rest of Westeros society. All the while, he never loses his trademark wit and humor.

All in all, great acting and writing, and perfectly placed in the show to culminate Tyrion's story arc. After this, Tyrion is a more of a dull and straight character serving as the hand of Daenerys, to me at least.",18,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
2650,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-18,2019,1,18,14,ah777q,self.gameofthrones,"[SPOILERS] Nothing is what it seems but the exact opposite. The fire brings darkness, love brings suffering, power brings corruption. More importantly, the friends are in fact the enemies, and history is a full circle. I think this is a way to understand the whole story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ah777q/spoilers_nothing_is_what_it_seems_but_the_exact/,whycuthair,1547789222,"I just had a mind blowing moment while working on a different theory. Just realised that the true enemies have been hidden all along. It isn't the Night King. What he is doing is actually trying to save the world! My whole idea starts from this. You know how Melissandre always says the night is dark and full of terrors? How only light can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(dragon) glass. That is the only eternal flame. The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! Fire burns everything to ash, leaving nothing behind([not even stone can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)). The Night King has no choice but to fight the fire that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that with ice, with people who's hearts cannot be tricked by wizards, very light creatures, you could say.

Remember how the witch had told Danny she would never have other sons? What rituals she did to Khal Drogo? She wasn't lying. Khal Drogo's life paid for the life of Danny's dragons, but they are not her babies. They are tools for the red priests, and they have controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'hlor   and Melissandre are actually evil, like Satan([Arstan](http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arstan_Selmy)) or something, Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire and R'hlor is, her faith resembling that of her dragon, Drogon, named after her first love, Khal Drogo. If Danny then becomes the Night Queen, she will fight on her one true dragon against the fire that had tricked her and her family's hearts for so long.  From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from doing whatever they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4)! And what they want is only to please the God of Death. Which, at this point, I have to say I am pretty sure is the same God that Melissandre makes sacrifices to. Don't forget where the faceless men started. Fiery mines. Fiery Gods. Bringing the mercy of death to people in suffering. Whispering a few encouraging words in their ears. In fact their saying is the same, All men must die. But Melissandre isn't the only sorcerer working for the Lord of Light either.


What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. He is the one suggesting that Barristan Selmy be removed from the King's Guard(for further plans). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan do Daenerys, is actually just one of the spider's tricks. He is also the one telling Ned how the king is doomed and he must help him. He releases Tyrion, who further kills his father and brings all sorts of tragedies to Kings Landing. We are given a backstory from his own mouth, while the other witness is unable to tell his story. That is all we know of the Spider, who claims to hate red priests but when he meets with one they talk like old friends..



Who, from those who have seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good and rich and in high society of all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. (Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and mute like Euron's sailors) Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. ""where only ghosts and spiders walk"". Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar, escape, knowing he might end up killing his brother, sister, who knows who.. 

So the red priests might have been grooming and manipulating Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution for the people. That was the solution the faceless men offered to the slaves when they were suffering as well. Death.  I mean, if he cared about the people, as he always states, why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city?   Because he was the one whispering in the Mad King ears to do it! He is the whisperer... There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least know to try and save Ellaria's kids or something. He did none of that. Remember the Tragedy at Summerhall? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish, including one Lord Comman, known as Ser Duncan the Tall,  the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.. Sounds like how this could have went had Jamie not stepped in..

History does tend to repeat itself, doesn't it? And it's always about love too, just like Danny's third betrayal..""The whispers became a swirling song three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love"".

Ser Duncan had fought and defeated Ser Barristan Selmy when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress Ashara Dayne who, as he said, he loved, as much as everyone. (Danny's third betrayal). He was wearing a mask, but when they saw him, Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give him a chance, just for a laugh most likely. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. A boy, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how Barristan got his nickname ""The bold"". They would all die at the [**Tragedy at Summerhall**.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tragedy_at_Summerhall)

Reminding me a lot of Littlefinger's tragedy of losing to the Stark for Catelyn's love, Barristan was pretty embarassed at the tourney. Years later, however reminding us of another love story involving a mistery knight, to show how strong love is, Barristan defeated Ser Duncan, just like Brienne defeatead  Ser Loras Tyrel..  

In the end, as honourable and bold as Barristan was considered, he did betray Ned. That is the biggest proof there is of him being fishy. The mask he was wearing in the tourney is a mask he was wearing his whole life. If he were really honourable he would have been the one to stop the Mad King. Not Jamie. He even hated Jamie for what he did even though... 


In 259 AC, Prince Duncan died in the **Tragedy at Summerhall** along with his father, King Aegon V Targaryen, his namesake Ser Duncan the Tall, and several other members of the royal court.. ***any died, and fire destroyed the castle, leaving it a ruin. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, sorcery was involved.***  The tragedy where both the brother and the father of the Mad King died? Hmmm. The plot thickens..

What else is there in Ser Barristan's life? The Harenhal tournament. Where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, which led to the great war. It turns out that , at least ****according to Ser Barristan Selmy, Ashara was dishonored by a man at Harrenhal....****. Also, it was at Harrenhal's tournament that Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall. Strange, however that this most honourable men would happen to be in both situations and not be able to do anything!  Other then that, the fact that he wrote about his own self in the books of the Lord Commanders is a huge give away ""**Only Ser Barristan's entry in the White Book tells of this tourney. He defended the passage against all comers.** ""













Danny would in the end have to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing. 



As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was [Syrio Forel](https://youtu.be/upcWBut9mrI) who was there on mission for the Lord of Light as well. He was sent to turn a Stark into their own assassin, and introduce her to the God of Death. But he sees something in. But, as it turns out, instead of doing that, he cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances. For it's easy to imagine that Syrio lived after that scene. He could have easily asked them for mercy and asked to take the black. He would later end up being saved by [Arya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Zh2uST6PU) on the way to the wall Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When [Beric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI) looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a [shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWFIkejWrg). That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. [We offer you these false gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3au7ZW5Bo-s). Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, [and his name is death,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDPl2Ey7Jw) Jaagen would say. Or [Syrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXK-inss34). So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the [white walkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guhc75cGY2Q)! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria, the town of fire(valyrian steel) work against the dead and cold fighting on the side of the cold. In the words of maester Aemon's, ""Fire consumes but ice preserves."" The Night King had not been spotted for thousands of years until the Gods had flipped a coin again for the Targaryens, sending this time one with a heart full of fire and rage!

So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the witch of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl, against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, Taking the Night King's placeWhy that? Because that's how I think Azor Ahai defeat the Night King last time. He sacrificed his own love. The pure line that the Night King uses to create his white walkers from Craster's sons born out of incest parallels Danny's incestuous family. Seems at each side of the spectrum lies the primordial sin, incest. Like Satan's incest with his own daughters in Milton's Paradise Lost, both in the realm of ice as well as of fire, a strong ruler can be born only out of this sin.  

But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities to control an entire hive mind, maybe Jon will be the one to turn into the new Night King.In the books he can warg, in the show not really.  So the show will most likely have Bran become the Night King. Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the [evil men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz0JpXUnh2M)(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light.  This is why the Night King is not the bad guy here. His only reason for raising an army is to fight the fire. Maybe he doesn't want his soldiers to suffer and that's why he only uses dead ones. He knows that The Wall is a place where more crooked men are sent to pay for their punishments, and might have even set the Castle Black himself. He most certainly helpled built the wall(Mr. Brandon the builder). This is also the reason why he lets Jon go at Harrenhall. I bet he feels all their suffering too, when they are fighting. Now that is truly Azor Ahai like, don't you think? Sacrificing himself, and a few of his people, to fight the real threat. The threat that comes to all men alike is not freezing, but burning. [Trees](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV8de7uvbfAhXIJ1AKHZn0D1gQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgameofthrones.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCave_of_the_Three-Eyed_Raven&amp;psig=AOvVaw3h0AEGIczcMdGlCLhGw3qD&amp;ust=1547870865136165) burn, [men](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/41/Wildfire_explosion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150328212702) burn, [stone](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6b/Harrenhal1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160729062633) burns. 

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Princehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0 that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of [Dornish origins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0), passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. The dragon, to quote Rhaegar, has three heads however. So in the books you will have Jon, Danny and the first Aegon to fight against the three heads of the beast that R'hllor uses to bring doom to the world. Almost like Cerberus..

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. Then Bran take the Night King place to represent the Ice dragon..



Edit 1: You can also  see why Varys is a red priest when he meets Melissandre as she's staring at Blackwater on the cliff. First thing he says is **I wonder why you weren't there to meet our guests**(Stannis's attack on King's Landing, the wildfire in the Blackwater..)They talk as if they were some old friends. She calls him ""dear spider"" and he calls her ""my Lady"".He tells her [**You begged us to summon the King in the North**](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8)  ""Don't you want to see him again?""  **YES! SUMMON FROM THE DEAD!!!**   ""I have done my part!"" She mentions something about her mission being done, but he makes a comment that once a common man has a taste of the good life he will not just leave it , just like the lion who tasted man! Who was that lion? Was it Tywin, who betrayed the king? Or maybe Arya has another pie surprise for Cersei?! But says **Nothing is ever so sweet again** so maybe a lemon cake? :P She replies to him that neither of them are common folk any more, and they both smile. Might be that it was her who was the witch that cut off his penis too. After all, that old guy in the crate, if you remember, had his mouth sewn shut, he couldn't even say his side of the story!My guess is that the guy was probably someone he kept so he could use for his flames! I mean, what happens to that crate? Why was he carrying him around? Then he has Tyrion in a simmilar crate. His new lab rat....... ANYWAY....

But no, I think it's the other way around! Melissandre is upset about having had sacrificed Shireeen, and leaving on bad terms with the king in the north(Stannis). She says she is an obstacle and wants to get out of the way.  Then Varys says that is right, and warns Melissandre to leave Westeros, knowing what it is to come(he has seen it in the flames), but she surprises him by telling that they will both die there, something he has not seen, which disappoints him, since that sweet life he had that he paid R'hllor with is soul for was coming to an end. Not to mention that Varys look pretty young even though we know he was there during the Mad King reign as well. He also talks to Melissandre from a superior position. He doesn't seem to hate her, as he's supposed to hate all sorcerers. He seems very out of character. Just like Pycelle when he is alone in the chamber and no one can see him. He is being himself. Just look at that evil look and smirk.. Maybe under those silk robes he is hiding a necklace just like Melissandre's!  All in all, even his R'hllor's worshippers seem to pay with their lives. Add the flames and all that and he sounds a bit devilish, if you ask me..

Edit 2: 
For further proof of the red priests involvement in the Targaryen lives. When Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth. Ilyrio sold her to Khal Drogo and gave her the dragon eggs that would help bring the doom upon Westeros again. Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called The Tragedy at Summerhall. *""the blood of the dragon gathered in one 
 seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned 
 pyromancers 
 wild fire 
 flames grew out of control  towering  burned so hot that 
 died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman,,,""* How fortunate that the dragon eggs would end up in Illyrio Mopatis's hand, Varys's friend! The spider who played with fire. Don't also forget how Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....""While whispers of a certain eunuch's talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king."" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)

Edit 3: Even though it breaks my heart to say this, but I think Barristan might be working with Varys.  If  you look at the House Selmy sygil what do you see? Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Three , for the head of the dragons, and yellow,which  symbolises cowardice and deceit, but also poisoning and death. (All is known on the wikia is this: 
*Sigil : Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Region: The Stormlands. Allegiance: Uncertain* The house they  live in is called Harvest Hall. His only heir? Arstan. Almost like an acronym for Satan, with an extra R though. R for.... ? Also, George doesn't make unidimensional characters. You can't expect Ser Barristan the most honourable to actually be just that, just like Jamie isn't just a Kingslayer. But Barristan never liked Jamie(even though he's a wise man, presumably) The first person Barristan ever killed? A tyroshi. He doesn't say soldier, or anything. Never even learned his name. Now what would Ser Barristan be doing all the way in Tyrosh? The Wineseller in Vaes Dothrak, who later attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen with poisoned wine, announces that among his wares is Tyroshi pear brandy. Yep. Barristan is not who he seems. The Lord of Light plays with people's hearts, gets them on fire.

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his father and brother died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then he got   spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King,[ Tywin Lannister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECewrAld3zw) (who had once been one of his closest friends) There is the possibilty that the Mad King might have slept with Tywin's wife, leading to her death(perhaps not at birth, but actually by Tywin's own hands, for dishonouring him) and the birth of [Tyrion](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tyrion-game-of-thrones-peter-dinklage.jpeg?quality=85). If Jon  is the bridge between Starks and Targaryens, Tyrion(the tyrant) is the bridge between the [Targaryens and the Lannisters](https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/tyrion-lannister-tywin-mad-king-aerys-hbo.jpg?w=900&amp;h=506). Even a [small dragon](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/5976759237c5818e9675daa2/597675941e5b6ccba4f40236/1500935573839/702_Props_Skulls_03.jpg) is still a [dragon](http://static1.uk.businessinsider.com/image/592edbf7da6dde1306428295-1440/screen%20shot%202015-10-01%20at%2012943%20pm.jpg) But then again, Tywion could also just be worshipping the [Red](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DfWvDYM8L._SY879_.jpg) God of Fire [himself](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8), having sold his soul in order to be able to defeat the others [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECewrAld3zw), except Tyrion would have been better off to the [drowned god](https://youtu.be/oSTRfEDyQzM?t=171) than to the red one, because his god is red not for fire, but for [wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZjhkffY_J4). The rest is a history of [fire and blood](http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSQ2lrRKlCpL5yU0dJHue8kX6euuFuoSyTBnerDb8wliKylo99c). 

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart. The night King only uses dead as an army just because the don't have a heart. The reason why Jon doesn't fall for [Melissandre's tricks either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uT7JqKPsBA). 

The book covers are a give away as well. Notice how [A feast for Crows](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MylCMYnVL.jpg) is in fiery read, with a [ceremonial chalice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSE6mrNZ1cY)?

The Lord of Light brings darkness, love brings suffering, power brings corruption. More importantly, the friends are in fact the enemies, and men either die or serve. Or both. I think this is a way to understand the whole story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ah784d/spoilers_nothing_is_what_it_seems_but_the_exact/,whycuthair,1547789417,"I just had a mind blowing moment while working on a different theory. Just realised that the true enemies have been hidden all along. It isn't the Night King. What he is doing is actually trying to save the world! My whole idea starts from this. You know how Melissandre always says the night is dark and full of terrors? How only light can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(dragon) glass. That is the only eternal flame. The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! Fire burns everything to ash, leaving nothing behind([not even stone can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)). The Night King has no choice but to fight the fire that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that with ice, with people who's hearts cannot be tricked by wizards, very light creatures, you could say.

Remember how the witch had told Danny she would never have other sons? What rituals she did to Khal Drogo? She wasn't lying. Khal Drogo's life paid for the life of Danny's dragons, but they are not her babies. They are tools for the red priests, and they have controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'hlor   and Melissandre are actually evil, like Satan([Arstan](http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arstan_Selmy)) or something, Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire and R'hlor is, her faith resembling that of her dragon, Drogon, named after her first love, Khal Drogo. If Danny then becomes the Night Queen, she will fight on her one true dragon against the fire that had tricked her and her family's hearts for so long.  From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from doing whatever they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4)! And what they want is only to please the God of Death. Which, at this point, I have to say I am pretty sure is the same God that Melissandre makes sacrifices to. Don't forget where the faceless men started. Fiery mines. Fiery Gods. Bringing the mercy of death to people in suffering. Whispering a few encouraging words in their ears. In fact their saying is the same, All men must die. But Melissandre isn't the only sorcerer working for the Lord of Light either.


What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. He is the one suggesting that Barristan Selmy be removed from the King's Guard(for further plans). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan do Daenerys, is actually just one of the spider's tricks. He is also the one telling Ned how the king is doomed and he must help him. He releases Tyrion, who further kills his father and brings all sorts of tragedies to Kings Landing. We are given a backstory from his own mouth, while the other witness is unable to tell his story. That is all we know of the Spider, who claims to hate red priests but when he meets with one they talk like old friends..



Who, from those who have seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good and rich and in high society of all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. (Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and mute like Euron's sailors) Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. ""where only ghosts and spiders walk"". Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar, escape, knowing he might end up killing his brother, sister, who knows who.. 

So the red priests might have been grooming and manipulating Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution for the people. That was the solution the faceless men offered to the slaves when they were suffering as well. Death.  I mean, if he cared about the people, as he always states, why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city?   Because he was the one whispering in the Mad King ears to do it! He is the whisperer... There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least know to try and save Ellaria's kids or something. He did none of that. Remember the Tragedy at Summerhall? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish, including one Lord Comman, known as Ser Duncan the Tall,  the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.. Sounds like how this could have went had Jamie not stepped in..

History does tend to repeat itself, doesn't it? And it's always about love too, just like Danny's third betrayal..""The whispers became a swirling song three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love"".

Ser Duncan had fought and defeated Ser Barristan Selmy when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress Ashara Dayne who, as he said, he loved, as much as everyone. (Danny's third betrayal). He was wearing a mask, but when they saw him, Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give him a chance, just for a laugh most likely. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. A boy, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how Barristan got his nickname ""The bold"". They would all die at the [**Tragedy at Summerhall**.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tragedy_at_Summerhall)

Reminding me a lot of Littlefinger's tragedy of losing to the Stark for Catelyn's love, Barristan was pretty embarassed at the tourney. Years later, however reminding us of another love story involving a mistery knight, to show how strong love is, Barristan defeated Ser Duncan, just like Brienne defeatead  Ser Loras Tyrel..  

In the end, as honourable and bold as Barristan was considered, he did betray Ned. That is the biggest proof there is of him being fishy. The mask he was wearing in the tourney is a mask he was wearing his whole life. If he were really honourable he would have been the one to stop the Mad King. Not Jamie. He even hated Jamie for what he did even though... 


In 259 AC, Prince Duncan died in the **Tragedy at Summerhall** along with his father, King Aegon V Targaryen, his namesake Ser Duncan the Tall, and several other members of the royal court.. ***any died, and fire destroyed the castle, leaving it a ruin. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, sorcery was involved.***  The tragedy where both the brother and the father of the Mad King died? Hmmm. The plot thickens..

What else is there in Ser Barristan's life? The Harenhal tournament. Where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, which led to the great war. It turns out that , at least ****according to Ser Barristan Selmy, Ashara was dishonored by a man at Harrenhal....****. Also, it was at Harrenhal's tournament that Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall. Strange, however that this most honourable men would happen to be in both situations and not be able to do anything!  Other then that, the fact that he wrote about his own self in the books of the Lord Commanders is a huge give away ""**Only Ser Barristan's entry in the White Book tells of this tourney. He defended the passage against all comers.** ""













Danny would in the end have to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing. 



As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was [Syrio Forel](https://youtu.be/upcWBut9mrI) who was there on mission for the Lord of Light as well. He was sent to turn a Stark into their own assassin, and introduce her to the God of Death. But he sees something in. But, as it turns out, instead of doing that, he cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances. For it's easy to imagine that Syrio lived after that scene. He could have easily asked them for mercy and asked to take the black. He would later end up being saved by [Arya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Zh2uST6PU) on the way to the wall Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When [Beric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI) looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a [shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWFIkejWrg). That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. [We offer you these false gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3au7ZW5Bo-s). Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, [and his name is death,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDPl2Ey7Jw) Jaagen would say. Or [Syrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXK-inss34). So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the [white walkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guhc75cGY2Q)! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria, the town of fire(valyrian steel) work against the dead and cold fighting on the side of the cold. In the words of maester Aemon's, ""Fire consumes but ice preserves."" The Night King had not been spotted for thousands of years until the Gods had flipped a coin again for the Targaryens, sending this time one with a heart full of fire and rage!

So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the witch of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl, against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, Taking the Night King's placeWhy that? Because that's how I think Azor Ahai defeat the Night King last time. He sacrificed his own love. The pure line that the Night King uses to create his white walkers from Craster's sons born out of incest parallels Danny's incestuous family. Seems at each side of the spectrum lies the primordial sin, incest. Like Satan's incest with his own daughters in Milton's Paradise Lost, both in the realm of ice as well as of fire, a strong ruler can be born only out of this sin.  

But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities to control an entire hive mind, maybe Jon will be the one to turn into the new Night King.In the books he can warg, in the show not really.  So the show will most likely have Bran become the Night King. Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the [evil men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz0JpXUnh2M)(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light.  This is why the Night King is not the bad guy here. His only reason for raising an army is to fight the fire. Maybe he doesn't want his soldiers to suffer and that's why he only uses dead ones. He knows that The Wall is a place where more crooked men are sent to pay for their punishments, and might have even set the Castle Black himself. He most certainly helpled built the wall(Mr. Brandon the builder). This is also the reason why he lets Jon go at Harrenhall. I bet he feels all their suffering too, when they are fighting. Now that is truly Azor Ahai like, don't you think? Sacrificing himself, and a few of his people, to fight the real threat. The threat that comes to all men alike is not freezing, but burning. [Trees](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV8de7uvbfAhXIJ1AKHZn0D1gQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgameofthrones.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCave_of_the_Three-Eyed_Raven&amp;psig=AOvVaw3h0AEGIczcMdGlCLhGw3qD&amp;ust=1547870865136165) burn, [men](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/41/Wildfire_explosion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150328212702) burn, [stone](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6b/Harrenhal1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160729062633) burns. 

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Princehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0 that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of [Dornish origins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0), passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. The dragon, to quote Rhaegar, has three heads however. So in the books you will have Jon, Danny and the first Aegon to fight against the three heads of the beast that R'hllor uses to bring doom to the world. Almost like Cerberus..

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. Then Bran take the Night King place to represent the Ice dragon..



Edit 1: You can also  see why Varys is a red priest when he meets Melissandre as she's staring at Blackwater on the cliff. First thing he says is **I wonder why you weren't there to meet our guests**(Stannis's attack on King's Landing, the wildfire in the Blackwater..)They talk as if they were some old friends. She calls him ""dear spider"" and he calls her ""my Lady"".He tells her [**You begged us to summon the King in the North**](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8)  ""Don't you want to see him again?""  **YES! SUMMON FROM THE DEAD!!!**   ""I have done my part!"" She mentions something about her mission being done, but he makes a comment that once a common man has a taste of the good life he will not just leave it , just like the lion who tasted man! Who was that lion? Was it Tywin, who betrayed the king? Or maybe Arya has another pie surprise for Cersei?! But says **Nothing is ever so sweet again** so maybe a lemon cake? :P She replies to him that neither of them are common folk any more, and they both smile. Might be that it was her who was the witch that cut off his penis too. After all, that old guy in the crate, if you remember, had his mouth sewn shut, he couldn't even say his side of the story!My guess is that the guy was probably someone he kept so he could use for his flames! I mean, what happens to that crate? Why was he carrying him around? Then he has Tyrion in a simmilar crate. His new lab rat....... ANYWAY....

But no, I think it's the other way around! Melissandre is upset about having had sacrificed Shireeen, and leaving on bad terms with the king in the north(Stannis). She says she is an obstacle and wants to get out of the way.  Then Varys says that is right, and warns Melissandre to leave Westeros, knowing what it is to come(he has seen it in the flames), but she surprises him by telling that they will both die there, something he has not seen, which disappoints him, since that sweet life he had that he paid R'hllor with is soul for was coming to an end. Not to mention that Varys look pretty young even though we know he was there during the Mad King reign as well. He also talks to Melissandre from a superior position. He doesn't seem to hate her, as he's supposed to hate all sorcerers. He seems very out of character. Just like Pycelle when he is alone in the chamber and no one can see him. He is being himself. Just look at that evil look and smirk.. Maybe under those silk robes he is hiding a necklace just like Melissandre's!  All in all, even his R'hllor's worshippers seem to pay with their lives. Add the flames and all that and he sounds a bit devilish, if you ask me..

Edit 2: 
For further proof of the red priests involvement in the Targaryen lives. When Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth. Ilyrio sold her to Khal Drogo and gave her the dragon eggs that would help bring the doom upon Westeros again. Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called The Tragedy at Summerhall. *""the blood of the dragon gathered in one 
 seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned 
 pyromancers 
 wild fire 
 flames grew out of control  towering  burned so hot that 
 died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman,,,""* How fortunate that the dragon eggs would end up in Illyrio Mopatis's hand, Varys's friend! The spider who played with fire. Don't also forget how Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....""While whispers of a certain eunuch's talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king."" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)

Edit 3: Even though it breaks my heart to say this, but I think Barristan might be working with Varys.  If  you look at the House Selmy sygil what do you see? Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Three , for the head of the dragons, and yellow,which  symbolises cowardice and deceit, but also poisoning and death. (All is known on the wikia is this: 
*Sigil : Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Region: The Stormlands. Allegiance: Uncertain* The house they  live in is called Harvest Hall. His only heir? Arstan. Almost like an acronym for Satan, with an extra R though. R for.... ? Also, George doesn't make unidimensional characters. You can't expect Ser Barristan the most honourable to actually be just that, just like Jamie isn't just a Kingslayer. But Barristan never liked Jamie(even though he's a wise man, presumably) The first person Barristan ever killed? A tyroshi. He doesn't say soldier, or anything. Never even learned his name. Now what would Ser Barristan be doing all the way in Tyrosh? The Wineseller in Vaes Dothrak, who later attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen with poisoned wine, announces that among his wares is Tyroshi pear brandy. Yep. Barristan is not who he seems. The Lord of Light plays with people's hearts, gets them on fire.

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his father and brother died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then he got   spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King,[ Tywin Lannister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECewrAld3zw) (who had once been one of his closest friends) There is the possibilty that the Mad King might have slept with Tywin's wife, leading to her death(perhaps not at birth, but actually by Tywin's own hands, for dishonouring him) and the birth of [Tyrion](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tyrion-game-of-thrones-peter-dinklage.jpeg?quality=85). If Jon  is the bridge between Starks and Targaryens, Tyrion(the tyrant) is the bridge between the [Targaryens and the Lannisters](https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/tyrion-lannister-tywin-mad-king-aerys-hbo.jpg?w=900&amp;h=506). Even a [small dragon](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/5976759237c5818e9675daa2/597675941e5b6ccba4f40236/1500935573839/702_Props_Skulls_03.jpg) is still a [dragon](http://static1.uk.businessinsider.com/image/592edbf7da6dde1306428295-1440/screen%20shot%202015-10-01%20at%2012943%20pm.jpg) But then again, Tywion could also just be worshipping the [Red](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DfWvDYM8L._SY879_.jpg) God of Fire [himself](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8), having sold his soul in order to be able to defeat the others [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECewrAld3zw), except Tyrion would have been better off to the [drowned god](https://youtu.be/oSTRfEDyQzM?t=171) than to the red one, because his god is red not for fire, but for [wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZjhkffY_J4). The rest is a history of [fire and blood](http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSQ2lrRKlCpL5yU0dJHue8kX6euuFuoSyTBnerDb8wliKylo99c). 

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart. The night King only uses dead as an army just because the don't have a heart. The reason why Jon doesn't fall for [Melissandre's tricks either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uT7JqKPsBA). 

The book covers are a give away as well. Notice how [A feast for Crows](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MylCMYnVL.jpg) is in fiery read, with a [ceremonial chalice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSE6mrNZ1cY)?

Just realised that the true enemies have been hidden all along. It isn't the Night King. What he is doing is actually trying to save the world! My whole idea starts from this. You know how Melissandre always says the night is dark and full of terrors? How only light can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(dragon) glass. That is the only eternal flame. The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! Fire burns everything to ash, leaving nothing behind([not even stone can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)). The Night King has no choice but to fight the fire that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that with ice, with people who's hearts cannot be tricked by wizards, very light creatures, you could say.

Remember how the witch had told Danny she would never have other sons? What rituals she did to Khal Drogo? She wasn't lying. Khal Drogo's life paid for the life of Danny's dragons, but they are not her babies. They are tools for the red priests, and they have controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'hlor   and Melissandre are actually evil, like Satan([Arstan](http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arstan_Selmy)) or something, Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire and R'hlor is, her faith resembling that of her dragon, Drogon, named after her first love, Khal Drogo. If Danny then becomes the Night Queen, she will fight on her one true dragon against the fire that had tricked her and her family's hearts for so long.  From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from doing whatever they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4)! And what they want is only to please the God of Death. Which, at this point, I have to say I am pretty sure is the same God that Melissandre makes sacrifices to. Don't forget where the faceless men started. Fiery mines. Fiery Gods. Bringing the mercy of death to people in suffering. Whispering a few encouraging words in their ears. In fact their saying is the same, All men must die. But Melissandre isn't the only sorcerer working for the Lord of Light either.


What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. He is the one suggesting that Barristan Selmy be removed from the King's Guard(for further plans). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan do Daenerys, is actually just one of the spider's tricks. He is also the one telling Ned how the king is doomed and he must help him. He releases Tyrion, who further kills his father and brings all sorts of tragedies to Kings Landing. We are given a backstory from his own mouth, while the other witness is unable to tell his story. That is all we know of the Spider, who claims to hate red priests but when he meets with one they talk like old friends..



Who, from those who have seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good and rich and in high society of all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. (Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and mute like Euron's sailors) Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. ""where only ghosts and spiders walk"". Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar, escape, knowing he might end up killing his brother, sister, who knows who.. 

So the red priests might have been grooming and manipulating Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution for the people. That was the solution the faceless men offered to the slaves when they were suffering as well. Death.  I mean, if he cared about the people, as he always states, why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city?   Because he was the one whispering in the Mad King ears to do it! He is the whisperer... There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least know to try and save Ellaria's kids or something. He did none of that. Remember the Tragedy at Summerhall? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish, including one Lord Comman, known as Ser Duncan the Tall,  the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.. Sounds like how this could have went had Jamie not stepped in..

History does tend to repeat itself, doesn't it? And it's always about love too, just like Danny's third betrayal..""The whispers became a swirling song three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love"".

Ser Duncan had fought and defeated Ser Barristan Selmy when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress Ashara Dayne who, as he said, he loved, as much as everyone. (Danny's third betrayal). He was wearing a mask, but when they saw him, Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give him a chance, just for a laugh most likely. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. A boy, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how Barristan got his nickname ""The bold"". They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**.

Reminding me a lot of Littlefinger's tragedy of losing to the Stark for Catelyn's love, Barristan was pretty embarassed at the tourney. Years later, however reminding us of another love story involving a mistery knight, to show how strong love is, Barristan defeated Ser Duncan, just like Brienne defeatead  Ser Loras Tyrel..  

In the end, as honourable and bold as Barristan was considered, he did betray Ned. That is the biggest proof there is of him being fishy. The mask he was wearing in the tourney is a mask he was wearing his whole life. If he were really honourable he would have been the one to stop the Mad King. Not Jamie. He even hated Jamie for what he did even though... 


In 259 AC, Prince Duncan died in the **Tragedy at Summerhall** along with his father, King Aegon V Targaryen, his namesake Ser Duncan the Tall, and several other members of the royal court.. ***any died, and fire destroyed the castle, leaving it a ruin. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, sorcery was involved.***  The tragedy where both the brother and the father of the Mad King died? Hmmm. The plot thickens..

What else is there in Ser Barristan's life? The Harenhal tournament. Where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, which led to the great war. It turns out that , at least ****according to Ser Barristan Selmy, Ashara was dishonored by a man at Harrenhal....****. Also, it was at Harrenhal's tournament that Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall. Strange, however that this most honourable men would happen to be in both situations and not be able to do anything!  Other then that, the fact that he wrote about his own self in the books of the Lord Commanders is a huge give away ""**Only Ser Barristan's entry in the White Book tells of this tourney. He defended the passage against all comers.** ""













Danny would in the end have to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing. 



As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was [Syrio Forel](https://youtu.be/upcWBut9mrI) who was there on mission for the Lord of Light as well. He was sent to turn a Stark into their own assassin, and introduce her to the God of Death. But he sees something in. But, as it turns out, instead of doing that, he cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances. For it's easy to imagine that Syrio lived after that scene. He could have easily asked them for mercy and asked to take the black. He would later end up being saved by [Arya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Zh2uST6PU) on the way to the wall Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When [Beric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI) looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a [shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWFIkejWrg). That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. [We offer you these false gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3au7ZW5Bo-s). Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, [and his name is death,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDPl2Ey7Jw) Jaagen would say. Or [Syrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXK-inss34). So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the [white walkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guhc75cGY2Q)! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria, the town of fire(valyrian steel) work against the dead and cold fighting on the side of the cold. In the words of maester Aemon's, ""Fire consumes but ice preserves."" The Night King had not been spotted for thousands of years until the Gods had flipped a coin again for the Targaryens, sending this time one with a heart full of fire and rage!

So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the witch of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl, against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, Taking the Night King's placeWhy that? Because that's how I think Azor Ahai defeat the Night King last time. He sacrificed his own love. The pure line that the Night King uses to create his white walkers from Craster's sons born out of incest parallels Danny's incestuous family. Seems at each side of the spectrum lies the primordial sin, incest. Like Satan's incest with his own daughters in Milton's Paradise Lost, both in the realm of ice as well as of fire, a strong ruler can be born only out of this sin.  

But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities to control an entire hive mind, maybe Jon will be the one to turn into the new Night King.In the books he can warg, in the show not really.  So the show will most likely have Bran become the Night King. Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the [evil men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz0JpXUnh2M)(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light.  This is why the Night King is not the bad guy here. His only reason for raising an army is to fight the fire. Maybe he doesn't want his soldiers to suffer and that's why he only uses dead ones. He knows that The Wall is a place where more crooked men are sent to pay for their punishments, and might have even set the Castle Black himself. He most certainly helpled built the wall(Mr. Brandon the builder). This is also the reason why he lets Jon go at Harrenhall. I bet he feels all their suffering too, when they are fighting. Now that is truly Azor Ahai like, don't you think? Sacrificing himself, and a few of his people, to fight the real threat. The threat that comes to all men alike is not freezing, but burning. [Trees](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV8de7uvbfAhXIJ1AKHZn0D1gQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgameofthrones.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCave_of_the_Three-Eyed_Raven&amp;psig=AOvVaw3h0AEGIczcMdGlCLhGw3qD&amp;ust=1547870865136165) burn, [men](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/41/Wildfire_explosion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150328212702) burn, [stone](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/6/6b/Harrenhal1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160729062633) burns. 

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Princehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0 that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of [Dornish origins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0), passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. The dragon, to quote Rhaegar, has three heads however. So in the books you will have Jon, Danny and the first Aegon to fight against the three heads of the beast that R'hllor uses to bring doom to the world. Almost like Cerberus..

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. Then Bran take the Night King place to represent the Ice dragon..



Edit 1: You can also  see why Varys is a red priest when he meets Melissandre as she's staring at Blackwater on the cliff. First thing he says is **I wonder why you weren't there to meet our guests**(Stannis's attack on King's Landing, the wildfire in the Blackwater..)They talk as if they were some old friends. She calls him ""dear spider"" and he calls her ""my Lady"".He tells her [**You begged us to summon the King in the North**](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8)  ""Don't you want to see him again?""  **YES! SUMMON FROM THE DEAD!!!**   ""I have done my part!"" She mentions something about her mission being done, but he makes a comment that once a common man has a taste of the good life he will not just leave it , just like the lion who tasted man! Who was that lion? Was it Tywin, who betrayed the king? Or maybe Arya has another pie surprise for Cersei?! But says **Nothing is ever so sweet again** so maybe a lemon cake? :P She replies to him that neither of them are common folk any more, and they both smile. Might be that it was her who was the witch that cut off his penis too. After all, that old guy in the crate, if you remember, had his mouth sewn shut, he couldn't even say his side of the story!My guess is that the guy was probably someone he kept so he could use for his flames! I mean, what happens to that crate? Why was he carrying him around? Then he has Tyrion in a simmilar crate. His new lab rat....... ANYWAY....

But no, I think it's the other way around! Melissandre is upset about having had sacrificed Shireeen, and leaving on bad terms with the king in the north(Stannis). She says she is an obstacle and wants to get out of the way.  Then Varys says that is right, and warns Melissandre to leave Westeros, knowing what it is to come(he has seen it in the flames), but she surprises him by telling that they will both die there, something he has not seen, which disappoints him, since that sweet life he had that he paid R'hllor with is soul for was coming to an end. Not to mention that Varys look pretty young even though we know he was there during the Mad King reign as well. He also talks to Melissandre from a superior position. He doesn't seem to hate her, as he's supposed to hate all sorcerers. He seems very out of character. Just like Pycelle when he is alone in the chamber and no one can see him. He is being himself. Just look at that evil look and smirk.. Maybe under those silk robes he is hiding a necklace just like Melissandre's!  All in all, even his R'hllor's worshippers seem to pay with their lives. Add the flames and all that and he sounds a bit devilish, if you ask me..

Edit 2: 
For further proof of the red priests involvement in the Targaryen lives. When Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth. Ilyrio sold her to Khal Drogo and gave her the dragon eggs that would help bring the doom upon Westeros again. Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called The Tragedy at Summerhall. *""the blood of the dragon gathered in one 
 seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned 
 pyromancers 
 wild fire 
 flames grew out of control  towering  burned so hot that 
 died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman,,,""* How fortunate that the dragon eggs would end up in Illyrio Mopatis's hand, Varys's friend! The spider who played with fire. Don't also forget how Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....""While whispers of a certain eunuch's talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king."" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)

Edit 3: Even though it breaks my heart to say this, but I think Barristan might be working with Varys.  If  you look at the House Selmy sygil what do you see? Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Three , for the head of the dragons, and yellow,which  symbolises cowardice and deceit, but also poisoning and death. (All is known on the wikia is this: 
*Sigil : Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Region: The Stormlands. Allegiance: Uncertain* The house they  live in is called Harvest Hall. His only heir? Arstan. Almost like an acronym for Satan, with an extra R though. R for.... ? Also, George doesn't make unidimensional characters. You can't expect Ser Barristan the most honourable to actually be just that, just like Jamie isn't just a Kingslayer. But Barristan never liked Jamie(even though he's a wise man, presumably) The first person Barristan ever killed? A tyroshi. He doesn't say soldier, or anything. Never even learned his name. Now what would Ser Barristan be doing all the way in Tyrosh? The Wineseller in Vaes Dothrak, who later attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen with poisoned wine, announces that among his wares is Tyroshi pear brandy. Yep. Barristan is not who he seems. The Lord of Light plays with people's hearts, gets them on fire.

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his father and brother died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then he got   spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister (who had once been one of his closest friends, but who, looking at Rains of Castamere is not a man to be messed with). The rest is a history of fire and blood. 

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart. The night King only uses dead as an army just because the don't have a heart. The reason why Jon doesn't fall for Melissandre's tricks either.

Nothing is what it seems but the exact opposite. Love brings suffering, power brings corruption. Men either die or serve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ah7izw/the_fight_between_ice_and_fire_is_actually/,whycuthair,1547791856,"I just had a mind blowing moment while working on a different theory. Just realised that the true enemies have been hidden all along. It isn't the Night King. What he is doing is actually trying to save the world! My whole idea starts from this. You know how Melissandre always says the night is dark and full of terrors? How only light can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(dragon) glass. That is the only eternal flame. The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! Fire burns everything to ash, leaving nothing behind([not even stone can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)). The Night King has no choice but to fight the fire that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that with ice, with people who's hearts cannot be tricked by wizards, very light creatures, you could say.

Remember how the witch had told Danny she would never have other sons? What rituals she did to Khal Drogo? She wasn't lying. Khal Drogo's life paid for the life of Danny's dragons, but they are not her babies. They are tools for the red priests, and they have controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'hlor   and Melissandre are actually evil, like Satan([Arstan](http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arstan_Selmy)) or something, Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire and R'hlor is, her faith resembling that of her dragon, Drogon, named after her first love, Khal Drogo. If Danny then becomes the Night Queen, she will fight on her one true dragon against the fire that had tricked her and her family's hearts for so long.  From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from doing whatever they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4)! And what they want is only to please the God of Death. Which, at this point, I have to say I am pretty sure is the same God that Melissandre makes sacrifices to. Don't forget where the faceless men started. Fiery mines. Fiery Gods. Bringing the mercy of death to people in suffering. Whispering a few encouraging words in their ears. In fact their saying is the same, All men must die. But Melissandre isn't the only sorcerer working for the Lord of Light either.


What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. He is the one suggesting that Barristan Selmy be removed from the King's Guard(for further plans). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan do Daenerys, is actually just one of the spider's tricks. He is also the one telling Ned how the king is doomed and he must help him. He releases Tyrion, who further kills his father and brings all sorts of tragedies to Kings Landing. We are given a backstory from his own mouth, while the other witness is unable to tell his story. That is all we know of the Spider, who claims to hate red priests but when he meets with one they talk like old friends..



Who, from those who have seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good and rich and in high society of all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. (Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and mute like Euron's sailors) Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. ""where only ghosts and spiders walk"". Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar, escape, knowing he might end up killing his brother, sister, who knows who.. 

So the red priests might have been grooming and manipulating Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution for the people. That was the solution the faceless men offered to the slaves when they were suffering as well. Death.  I mean, if he cared about the people, as he always states, why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city?   Because he was the one whispering in the Mad King ears to do it! He is the whisperer... There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least know to try and save Ellaria's kids or something. He did none of that. Remember the Tragedy at Summerhall? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish, including one Lord Comman, known as Ser Duncan the Tall,  the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.. Sounds like how this could have went had Jamie not stepped in..

History does tend to repeat itself, doesn't it? And it's always about love too, just like Danny's third betrayal..""The whispers became a swirling song three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love"".

Ser Duncan had fought and defeated Ser Barristan Selmy when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress Ashara Dayne who, as he said, he loved, as much as everyone. (Danny's third betrayal). He was wearing a mask, but when they saw him, Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give him a chance, just for a laugh most likely. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. A boy, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how Barristan got his nickname ""The bold"". They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**.

Reminding me a lot of Littlefinger's tragedy of losing to the Stark for Catelyn's love, Barristan was pretty embarassed at the tourney. Years later, however reminding us of another love story involving a mistery knight, to show how strong love is, Barristan defeated Ser Duncan, just like Brienne defeatead  Ser Loras Tyrel..  

In the end, as honourable and bold as Barristan was considered, he did betray Ned. That is the biggest proof there is of him being fishy. The mask he was wearing in the tourney is a mask he was wearing his whole life. If he were really honourable he would have been the one to stop the Mad King. Not Jamie. He even hated Jamie for what he did even though... 


In 259 AC, Prince Duncan died in the **Tragedy at Summerhall** along with his father, King Aegon V Targaryen, his namesake Ser Duncan the Tall, and several other members of the royal court.. ***any died, and fire destroyed the castle, leaving it a ruin. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, sorcery was involved.***  The tragedy where both the brother and the father of the Mad King died? Hmmm. The plot thickens..

What else is there in Ser Barristan's life? The Harenhal tournament. Where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, which led to the great war. It turns out that , at least ****according to Ser Barristan Selmy, Ashara was dishonored by a man at Harrenhal....****. Also, it was at Harrenhal's tournament that Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall. Strange, however that this most honourable men would happen to be in both situations and not be able to do anything!  Other then that, the fact that he wrote about his own self in the books of the Lord Commanders is a huge give away ""**Only Ser Barristan's entry in the White Book tells of this tourney. He defended the passage against all comers.** ""













Danny would in the end have to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing. 



As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was [Syrio Forel](https://youtu.be/upcWBut9mrI) who was there on mission for the Lord of Light as well. He was sent to turn a Stark into their own assassin, and introduce her to the God of Death. But he sees something in. But, as it turns out, instead of doing that, he cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances. For it's easy to imagine that Syrio lived after that scene. He could have easily asked them for mercy and asked to take the black. He would later end up being saved by [Arya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Zh2uST6PU) on the way to the wall Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When [Beric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI) looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a [shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWFIkejWrg). That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. [We offer you these false gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3au7ZW5Bo-s). Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, [and his name is death,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDPl2Ey7Jw) Jaagen would say. Or [Syrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXK-inss34). So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the [white walkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guhc75cGY2Q)! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria, the town of fire(valyrian steel) work against the dead and cold fighting on the side of the cold. In the words of maester Aemon's, ""Fire consumes but ice preserves."" The Night King had not been spotted for thousands of years until the Gods had flipped a coin again for the Targaryens, sending this time one with a heart full of fire and rage!

So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the witch of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl, against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, Taking the Night King's placeWhy that? Because that's how I think Azor Ahai defeat the Night King last time. He sacrificed his own love. The pure line that the Night King uses to create his white walkers from Craster's sons born out of incest parallels Danny's incestuous family. Seems at each side of the spectrum lies the primordial sin, incest. Like Satan's incest with his own daughters in Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", both in the realm of ice as well as of fire, a strong ruler can be born only out of this incestuous sin.  Unless your God is the Drowned God, for whom you have to be born again. 

But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities to control an entire hive mind, maybe Jon will be the one to turn into the new Night King.In the books he can warg, in the show not really.  So the show will most likely have Bran become the Night King. Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the [evil men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz0JpXUnh2M)(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light.  This is why the Night King is not the bad guy here. His only reason for raising an army is to fight the fire. Maybe he doesn't want his soldiers to suffer and that's why he only uses dead ones. He knows that The Wall is a place where more crooked men are sent to pay for their punishments, and might have even set the Castle Black himself. He most certainly helpled built the wall(Mr. Brandon the builder). This is also the reason why he lets Jon go at Harrenhall. I bet he feels all their suffering too, when they are fighting. Now that is truly Azor Ahai like, don't you think? Sacrificing himself, and a few of his people, to fight the real threat. The threat that comes to all men alike is not freezing, but burning. [Trees burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83EPdpfIYwU), [men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuNyWMAWptE) burn, and even [stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-vGBM4QkOs) burns. 

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.)

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Princehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0 that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of [Dornish origins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0), passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. The dragon, to quote Rhaegar, has three heads however. So in the books you will have Jon, Danny and the first Aegon to fight against the three heads of the beast that R'hllor uses to bring doom to the world. Almost like Cerberus..

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. Then Bran take the Night King place to represent the Ice dragon..



Edit 1: You can also  see why Varys is a red priest when he meets Melissandre as she's staring at Blackwater on the cliff. First thing he says is **I wonder why you weren't there to meet our guests**(Stannis's attack on King's Landing, the wildfire in the Blackwater..)They talk as if they were some old friends. She calls him ""dear spider"" and he calls her ""my Lady"".He tells her [**You begged us to summon the King in the North**](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8)  ""Don't you want to see him again?""  **YES! SUMMON FROM THE DEAD!!!**   ""I have done my part!"" She mentions something about her mission being done, but he makes a comment that once a common man has a taste of the good life he will not just leave it , just like the lion who tasted man! Who was that lion? Was it Tywin, who betrayed the king? Or maybe Arya has another pie surprise for Cersei?! But says **Nothing is ever so sweet again** so maybe a lemon cake? :P She replies to him that neither of them are common folk any more, and they both smile. Might be that it was her who was the witch that cut off his penis too. After all, that old guy in the crate, if you remember, had his mouth sewn shut, he couldn't even say his side of the story!My guess is that the guy was probably someone he kept so he could use for his flames! I mean, what happens to that crate? Why was he carrying him around? Then he has Tyrion in a simmilar crate. His new lab rat....... ANYWAY....

But no, I think it's the other way around! Melissandre is upset about having had sacrificed Shireeen, and leaving on bad terms with the king in the north(Stannis). She says she is an obstacle and wants to get out of the way.  Then Varys says that is right, and warns Melissandre to leave Westeros, knowing what it is to come(he has seen it in the flames), but she surprises him by telling that they will both die there, something he has not seen, which disappoints him, since that sweet life he had that he paid R'hllor with is soul for was coming to an end. Not to mention that Varys look pretty young even though we know he was there during the Mad King reign as well. He also talks to Melissandre from a superior position. He doesn't seem to hate her, as he's supposed to hate all sorcerers. He seems very out of character. Just like Pycelle when he is alone in the chamber and no one can see him. He is being himself. Just look at that evil look and smirk.. Maybe under those silk robes he is hiding a necklace just like Melissandre's!  All in all, even his R'hllor's worshippers seem to pay with their lives. Add the flames and all that and he sounds a bit devilish, if you ask me..

Edit 2: 
For further proof of the red priests involvement in the Targaryen lives. When Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth. Ilyrio sold her to Khal Drogo and gave her the dragon eggs that would help bring the doom upon Westeros again. Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called The Tragedy at Summerhall. *""the blood of the dragon gathered in one 
 seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned 
 pyromancers 
 wild fire 
 flames grew out of control  towering  burned so hot that 
 died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman,,,""* How fortunate that the dragon eggs would end up in Illyrio Mopatis's hand, Varys's friend! The spider who played with fire. Don't also forget how Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....""While whispers of a certain eunuch's talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king."" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)

Edit 3: Even though it breaks my heart to say this, but I think Barristan might be working with Varys.  If  you look at the House Selmy sygil what do you see? Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Three , for the head of the dragons, and yellow,which  symbolises cowardice and deceit, but also poisoning and death. (All is known on the wikia is this: 
*Sigil : Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Region: The Stormlands. Allegiance: Uncertain* The house they  live in is called Harvest Hall. His only heir? Arstan. Almost like an acronym for Satan, with an extra R though. R for.... ? Also, George doesn't make unidimensional characters. You can't expect Ser Barristan the most honourable to actually be just that, just like Jamie isn't just a Kingslayer. But Barristan never liked Jamie(even though he's a wise man, presumably) The first person Barristan ever killed? A tyroshi. He doesn't say soldier, or anything. Never even learned his name. Now what would Ser Barristan be doing all the way in Tyrosh? The Wineseller in Vaes Dothrak, who later attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen with poisoned wine, announces that among his wares is Tyroshi pear brandy. Yep. Barristan is not who he seems. The Lord of Light plays with people's hearts, gets them on fire.
In the books, we even side with Barristan when he cuts down Hizdahr zo Loraq after accusing him for working with the harpies asking him if he's the harpy ""Tell me true and you shall have a quick clean death.""to which Hizdahr tries to dismiss Barristan from his services! Meaning he had him under his services all along, but Barristan yet again has been wearing a mask. When Barristan drew his sword ..""*a sharp edge[of the sword] caught the light of the brazier  and it became a line of orange fire*"". Who else has swords that just turn into fire?

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his father and brother died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then he got   spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister (who had once been one of his closest friends, but who, looking at Rains of Castamere is not a man to be messed with). The rest is a history of fire and blood. 

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart. The night King only uses dead as an army just because the don't have a heart. The reason why Jon doesn't fall for Melissandre's tricks either. 

The book covers are a give away as well. Notice how A feast for Crows is in fiery read, with a [ceremonial chalice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSE6mrNZ1cY)?

You know how Melissandre always says the night is dark and full of terrors? How only light can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(dragon) glass. That is the only eternal flame. The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! Fire burns everything to ash, leaving nothing behind([not even stone can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)). The Night King has no choice but to fight the fire that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that with ice, with people who's hearts cannot be tricked by wizards, very light creatures, you could say.

Remember how the witch had told Danny she would never have other sons? What rituals she did to Khal Drogo? She wasn't lying. Khal Drogo's life paid for the life of Danny's dragons, but they are not her babies. They are tools for the red priests, and they have controlled Danny to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why their magic grows stronger as well. Realising that fire is actually evil (can be used in bad ways like her father did, dragons get out of control), and R'hlor   and Melissandre are actually evil, like Satan([Arstan](http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arstan_Selmy)) or something, Daenerys would have one more reason to sacrifice herself or her dragons, seeing how bad fire and R'hlor is, her faith resembling that of her dragon, Drogon, named after her first love, Khal Drogo. If Danny then becomes the Night Queen, she will fight on her one true dragon against the fire that had tricked her and her family's hearts for so long.  From spitting fire to spitting ice. A song of Ice and Fire, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?

So if the [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from doing whatever they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4)! And what they want is only to please the God of Death. Which, at this point, I have to say I am pretty sure is the same God that Melissandre makes sacrifices to. Don't forget where the faceless men started. Fiery mines. Fiery Gods. Bringing the mercy of death to people in suffering. Whispering a few encouraging words in their ears. In fact their saying is the same, All men must die. But Melissandre isn't the only sorcerer working for the Lord of Light either.


What I think is something more hidden here is that Varys himself is a red priest, playing the long con, just like Pycelle was never back bent and stuttering. He is the one suggesting that Barristan Selmy be removed from the King's Guard(for further plans). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan do Daenerys, is actually just one of the spider's tricks. He is also the one telling Ned how the king is doomed and he must help him. He releases Tyrion, who further kills his father and brings all sorts of tragedies to Kings Landing. We are given a backstory from his own mouth, while the other witness is unable to tell his story. That is all we know of the Spider, who claims to hate red priests but when he meets with one they talk like old friends..



Who, from those who have seen the flames, hadn't started worshipping R'holl? How would Varys become so good and rich and in high society of all of a sudden? He made a pact with the devil. (Hence why his little whisperers are so devilish, and mute like Euron's sailors) Why he knows every secret passage of the Iron Throne and Red Keep. ""where only ghosts and spiders walk"". Why he let Tyrion, the valonqar, escape, knowing he might end up killing his brother, sister, who knows who.. 

So the red priests might have been grooming and manipulating Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Well, red priests, again, think all men must die, so that is their solution for the people. That was the solution the faceless men offered to the slaves when they were suffering as well. Death.  I mean, if he cared about the people, as he always states, why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city?   Because he was the one whispering in the Mad King ears to do it! He is the whisperer... There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least know to try and save Ellaria's kids or something. He did none of that. Remember the Tragedy at Summerhall? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish, including one Lord Comman, known as Ser Duncan the Tall,  the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.. Sounds like how this could have went had Jamie not stepped in..

History does tend to repeat itself, doesn't it? And it's always about love too, just like Danny's third betrayal..""The whispers became a swirling song three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love"".

Ser Duncan had fought and defeated Ser Barristan Selmy when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress Ashara Dayne who, as he said, he loved, as much as everyone. (Danny's third betrayal). He was wearing a mask, but when they saw him, Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give him a chance, just for a laugh most likely. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. A boy, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how Barristan got his nickname ""The bold"". They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**.

Reminding me a lot of Littlefinger's tragedy of losing to the Stark for Catelyn's love, Barristan was pretty embarassed at the tourney. Years later, however reminding us of another love story involving a mistery knight, to show how strong love is, Barristan defeated Ser Duncan, just like Brienne defeatead  Ser Loras Tyrel..  

In the end, as honourable and bold as Barristan was considered, he did betray Ned. That is the biggest proof there is of him being fishy. The mask he was wearing in the tourney is a mask he was wearing his whole life. If he were really honourable he would have been the one to stop the Mad King. Not Jamie. He even hated Jamie for what he did even though... 


In 259 AC, Prince Duncan died in the **Tragedy at Summerhall** along with his father, King Aegon V Targaryen, his namesake Ser Duncan the Tall, and several other members of the royal court.. ***any died, and fire destroyed the castle, leaving it a ruin. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, sorcery was involved.***  The tragedy where both the brother and the father of the Mad King died? Hmmm. The plot thickens..

What else is there in Ser Barristan's life? The Harenhal tournament. Where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, which led to the great war. It turns out that , at least ****according to Ser Barristan Selmy, Ashara was dishonored by a man at Harrenhal....****. Also, it was at Harrenhal's tournament that Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall. Strange, however that this most honourable men would happen to be in both situations and not be able to do anything!  Other then that, the fact that he wrote about his own self in the books of the Lord Commanders is a huge give away ""**Only Ser Barristan's entry in the White Book tells of this tourney. He defended the passage against all comers.** ""













Danny would in the end have to make a choice and fight against fire with ice. Her Viserion(and in that, her brother's spirit, Viseris) will then be her help! No one knows how the doom in Valyria came either, but they died in flames. Why not their dragons turning against them? Why would the Targaryens be left alone then, if not as a plot to conquer the world through fire and blood? Might even make what the Night King is doing turn into something good, since he only did start appearing since Robbert's rebellion and trying to coincide with Danny's landing. 



As for Valyria, the faceless men had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men is the same God as Melissandre's. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves and by Faceless Men alike. By men who fought against the old blood of Valyria. From where only the Targaryens escaped.. Although Daenerys freed the people, she was still a ruler who would pride herself in her old Valiryan blood. Perhaps their chains do not come off as easily. Or they do not forget your ancestors mistakes. The only wise Braavosi was [Syrio Forel](https://youtu.be/upcWBut9mrI) who was there on mission for the Lord of Light as well. He was sent to turn a Stark into their own assassin, and introduce her to the God of Death. But he sees something in. But, as it turns out, instead of doing that, he cared for her too much to say to the God of death ""Not today"" on many instances. For it's easy to imagine that Syrio lived after that scene. He could have easily asked them for mercy and asked to take the black. He would later end up being saved by [Arya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Zh2uST6PU) on the way to the wall Unless we have a surprise from Sansa/no one.)

When [Beric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI) looked on the other side, he only saw darkness. Remember what killed Renly? That was not a [shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWFIkejWrg). That was pure darkness. The purpose of the God of Death and of R'hllor are the same, to bring darkness to all men ""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. [We offer you these false gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3au7ZW5Bo-s). Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors."" There is but one God, [and his name is death,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDPl2Ey7Jw) Jaagen would say. Or [Syrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIXK-inss34). So the Red priests, as well as the faceless men, believe the Lord of Light, what a tricky name, is the ""one true god"", and all other gods from other religions - The Old Gods of the Forest, the Faith of the Seven, the Drowned God, etc. - are demons and false idols that must be cast down and burned. Which we know not to be true. Easy to see then why Melissandre is fighting against the light. Why also the children of the forest would have created the [white walkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guhc75cGY2Q)! Seemed more obvious that ice was made to fight fire, than the other way around, right? Why the weapons of old Valyria, the town of fire(valyrian steel) work against the dead and cold fighting on the side of the cold. In the words of maester Aemon's, ""Fire consumes but ice preserves."" The Night King had not been spotted for thousands of years until the Gods had flipped a coin again for the Targaryens, sending this time one with a heart full of fire and rage!

So it would be quite poetical if the fight would turn out to be between the witch of Fire, old as time, Melissandre ,worshipping R'holl, against the newly become queen of ice, Daenerys, Taking the Night King's placeWhy that? Because that's how I think Azor Ahai defeat the Night King last time. He sacrificed his own love. The pure line that the Night King uses to create his white walkers from Craster's sons born out of incest parallels Danny's incestuous family. Seems at each side of the spectrum lies the primordial sin, incest. Like Satan's incest with his own daughters in Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", both in the realm of ice as well as of fire, a strong ruler can be born only out of this incestuous sin.  Unless your God is the Drowned God, for whom you have to be born again. 

But since she doesn't have the warging capabilities to control an entire hive mind, maybe Jon will be the one to turn into the new Night King.In the books he can warg, in the show not really.  So the show will most likely have Bran become the Night King. Azor Ahai must sacrifice his loved one to save the world, that is for certain. But Light Bringer won't be and it never was a sword. It was and will be the dragon glass, obsidian, which the children used to create the first night king, to fight the [evil men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz0JpXUnh2M)(bewitched by red priests), which in Old Town maesters would try in vain to light the eternal flame on. That flame represents in this story the one true light.  This is why the Night King is not the bad guy here. His only reason for raising an army is to fight the fire. Maybe he doesn't want his soldiers to suffer and that's why he only uses dead ones. He knows that The Wall is a place where more crooked men are sent to pay for their punishments, and might have even set the Castle Black himself. He most certainly helpled built the wall(Mr. Brandon the builder). This is also the reason why he lets Jon go at Harrenhall. I bet he feels all their suffering too, when they are fighting. Now that is truly Azor Ahai like, don't you think? Sacrificing himself, and a few of his people, to fight the real threat. The threat that comes to all men alike is not freezing, but burning. [Trees burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83EPdpfIYwU), [men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuNyWMAWptE) burn, and even [stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-vGBM4QkOs) burns. 

(Tying the faceless men with the red priests could also explain Littlefinger's fake death theory, as Varys and Littlefinger have been two sides of an evil coin from the beginning.)

Let us also not forget in the end that in the books Aegon Targaryen, Raegar's actual first son, still lives. He might still be the Princehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0 that was promised, as it was prophecised, as far as the books go. Varys, and the red priests might have poisoned other Targaryen minds, but one as pure as one of [Dornish origins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0), passionate and courageous, who don't care at all about any gods, but just want to love and make love, can't be poisoned by gods and priests. I mean, if anyone is doing the poisoning, it's them! Also, it was love which caused a disruption in the Targaryen family last time as well, when Raegar fell for Lyanna. Something the red priests and all the spiders didn't foresee. And it wasn't the only time, if you look at the history of their family and how many times loved caused chaos in the realm. The dragon, to quote Rhaegar, has three heads however. So in the books you will have Jon, Danny and the first Aegon to fight against the three heads of the beast that R'hllor uses to bring doom to the world. Almost like Cerberus..

But the show doesn't have another Aegon. Jon is the Aegon missing from the Dorne plotline so most likely he will take his place. Then Bran take the Night King place to represent the Ice dragon..



Edit 1: You can also  see why Varys is a red priest when he meets Melissandre as she's staring at Blackwater on the cliff. First thing he says is **I wonder why you weren't there to meet our guests**(Stannis's attack on King's Landing, the wildfire in the Blackwater..)They talk as if they were some old friends. She calls him ""dear spider"" and he calls her ""my Lady"".He tells her [**You begged us to summon the King in the North**](https://youtu.be/6womXIXqFP8)  ""Don't you want to see him again?""  **YES! SUMMON FROM THE DEAD!!!**   ""I have done my part!"" She mentions something about her mission being done, but he makes a comment that once a common man has a taste of the good life he will not just leave it , just like the lion who tasted man! Who was that lion? Was it Tywin, who betrayed the king? Or maybe Arya has another pie surprise for Cersei?! But says **Nothing is ever so sweet again** so maybe a lemon cake? :P She replies to him that neither of them are common folk any more, and they both smile. Might be that it was her who was the witch that cut off his penis too. After all, that old guy in the crate, if you remember, had his mouth sewn shut, he couldn't even say his side of the story!My guess is that the guy was probably someone he kept so he could use for his flames! I mean, what happens to that crate? Why was he carrying him around? Then he has Tyrion in a simmilar crate. His new lab rat....... ANYWAY....

But no, I think it's the other way around! Melissandre is upset about having had sacrificed Shireeen, and leaving on bad terms with the king in the north(Stannis). She says she is an obstacle and wants to get out of the way.  Then Varys says that is right, and warns Melissandre to leave Westeros, knowing what it is to come(he has seen it in the flames), but she surprises him by telling that they will both die there, something he has not seen, which disappoints him, since that sweet life he had that he paid R'hllor with is soul for was coming to an end. Not to mention that Varys look pretty young even though we know he was there during the Mad King reign as well. He also talks to Melissandre from a superior position. He doesn't seem to hate her, as he's supposed to hate all sorcerers. He seems very out of character. Just like Pycelle when he is alone in the chamber and no one can see him. He is being himself. Just look at that evil look and smirk.. Maybe under those silk robes he is hiding a necklace just like Melissandre's!  All in all, even his R'hllor's worshippers seem to pay with their lives. Add the flames and all that and he sounds a bit devilish, if you ask me..

Edit 2: 
For further proof of the red priests involvement in the Targaryen lives. When Danny was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? Ser Willem Darry was a knight from House Darry who served as the Red Keep's master-at-arms. He was the one who saved them after the rebellion. The house where they lived, she remembers, had a red door. It also had a lemon tree in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was magic involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. And why would Illyrio Mopatis actually help them? And Varys too? Those two are the biggest conspirators ever! Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth. Ilyrio sold her to Khal Drogo and gave her the dragon eggs that would help bring the doom upon Westeros again. Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called The Tragedy at Summerhall. *""the blood of the dragon gathered in one 
 seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned 
 pyromancers 
 wild fire 
 flames grew out of control  towering  burned so hot that 
 died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman,,,""* How fortunate that the dragon eggs would end up in Illyrio Mopatis's hand, Varys's friend! The spider who played with fire. Don't also forget how Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....""While whispers of a certain eunuch's talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king."" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)

Edit 3: Even though it breaks my heart to say this, but I think Barristan might be working with Varys.  If  you look at the House Selmy sygil what do you see? Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Three , for the head of the dragons, and yellow,which  symbolises cowardice and deceit, but also poisoning and death. (All is known on the wikia is this: 
*Sigil : Three stalks of yellow wheat on a brown field. Region: The Stormlands. Allegiance: Uncertain* The house they  live in is called Harvest Hall. His only heir? Arstan. Almost like an acronym for Satan, with an extra R though. R for.... ? Also, George doesn't make unidimensional characters. You can't expect Ser Barristan the most honourable to actually be just that, just like Jamie isn't just a Kingslayer. But Barristan never liked Jamie(even though he's a wise man, presumably) The first person Barristan ever killed? A tyroshi. He doesn't say soldier, or anything. Never even learned his name. Now what would Ser Barristan be doing all the way in Tyrosh? The Wineseller in Vaes Dothrak, who later attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen with poisoned wine, announces that among his wares is Tyroshi pear brandy. Yep. Barristan is not who he seems. The Lord of Light plays with people's hearts, gets them on fire.
In the books, we even side with Barristan when he cuts down Hizdahr zo Loraq after accusing him for working with the harpies asking him if he's the harpy ""Tell me true and you shall have a quick clean death.""to which Hizdahr tries to dismiss Barristan from his services! Meaning he had him under his services all along, but Barristan yet again has been wearing a mask. When Barristan drew his sword ..""*a sharp edge[of the sword] caught the light of the brazier  and it became a line of orange fire*"". Who else has swords that just turn into fire??? Barristan killed Hizdahr because he might have been an actual good ruler, who would have hold Daenerys back from going to King's Landing.

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his father and brother died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then he got   spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister (who had once been one of his closest friends, but who, looking at Rains of Castamere is not a man to be messed with). The rest is a history of fire and blood. 

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart. The night King only uses dead as an army just because the don't have a heart. The reason why Jon doesn't fall for Melissandre's tricks either. 

The book covers are a give away as well. Notice how A feast for Crows is in fiery read, with a [ceremonial chalice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSE6mrNZ1cY)? You then have A [Game of thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulVUWrADCM) where the rulers will be the frozen ones and what seems to be a Valyrian steel sword..

&amp;#x200B;

Before Craster's death, it did not seem that the White Walkers had any plan invading Westeros (Correct me if I'm wrong). Maybe the White Walkers need humans in order to reproduce and the loss of Craster means they are no longer able to have babies sacrificed to them and that is their motive for invading Westeros.

This video by Alt Shift X explains the others in better detail and I believe that this theory could be the key to the puzzle and human sacrifice could be the way to end the war between the others and the humans. Cersei is supposedly having a baby and so possibly, the white walkers could end up in a situation where they take the baby and turn it into a White Walker, although this is a stretch.

In  episode 4x04, it is seen that the White Walkers are able to change a baby into a White Walker. What if Craster's agreement with the White  Walkers is what was maintaining the peace between the White Walkers and the humans?

Before Craster's death, it did not seem that the White Walkers had any plan on invading Westeros (Correct me if I'm wrong). Maybe the White Walkers need humans in order to reproduce and the loss of Craster means they are no longer able to have babies sacrificed to them and that is their motive for invading Westeros.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih\_ZAGCfMY0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih_ZAGCfMY0)

This video by Alt Shift X explains the others in better detail and I believe that this theory could be the key to the puzzle and human sacrifice could be the way to end the war between the others and the humans. Cersei is supposedly having a baby and so possibly, the white walkers could end up in a situation where they take the baby and turn it into a White Walker, although this is a stretch.

GRRM has made it clear that wars solve nothing and so instead of the whole series coming to an end due to a war, it could be this sacrifice and agreement instead?

Please comment if there are any major flaws with this theory as I really  believe this is how the conflict between the other's and the humans.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

My view was that it is Sansa who will be the first character to see that Dany is not worthy of being Queen of Westeros and will act against her, this will lead to Dany becoming the ultimate antagonist of the show beyond the NK and Cersai. My view is that theres some pretty decent evidence that Dany will not end up on the side of the angels and, whilst I completely accept I could be wrong, I certainly dont think it can be ruled out as impossible. Therefore Id like to state my case and, hopefully, follow it up with a reasonable debate.

Arguments that Dany is virtuous and will be a protagonist:

1. She freed the slaves. This is Danys biggest mark in the plus column, she abhors slavery and has made it her mission to free every slave she comes across. This is certainly a virtuous act but slavery isnt a Westeros concern, its already illegal and is largely irrelevant to her invasion. 

2. She will break the wheel. This is a great soundbite and many people have debated what it means, some people have even suggested shell bring democracy to Westeros. The problem is its only a soundbite, it has no definition. Dany wants the Iron Throne, that is established, she has sought the support of the great houses to achieve that aim and asked them to bend the knee to her and she has used force to subdue anyone who opposes her, this is no different to any ruler or Aegons invasion centuries ago. As of the end of season 7 there is nothing to suggest that, politically, her rule would be different to anyone elses.

3. She stopped fighting to unite against the WW. This was discussed as a temporary truce to deal with a larger threat. Dany is not stupid, she knows that the WWs must be stopped if she is to have a kingdom to rule and she knows her best chance of defeating the NK is to convince Cersai to work with her. This is not an act of virtue, it is a pragmatic decision to allow her to achieve her ultimate aim.

4. Shes commanded the Greyjoys to stop raiding Westeros. This is basic governance, the Greyjoys raid and pillage the Seven Kingdoms, its the Monarchs job to prevent this happening, theres no virtue in this command.

5. She risked her dragons to save Jon. The relationship between Jon and Dany is the centrepiece of this entire debate, for me to be correct the two of them will have to become rivals and, given the state of their relationship at the end of S7, this seems farfetched. The argument in my favour is the iceberg that none of the characters see coming, that Jon has a better claim to the throne than Dany. Some argue that this is irrelevant, that Jon does not desire the throne and Dany would happily rule as husband and wife anyway, I do not see it so simply. I believe that Danys whole psyche is linked to her quest for the throne, shes calm and reasonable because her quest is going so well, chinks in her faade appear when she suffers a setback in that quest. Consider how angry she became when Tyrions war plans started going wrong and how quickly she considered using her dragons on Kings Landing. I think that Dany will struggle with any threat to her quest and there are a number of ways that could play out.

Arguments that Dany will not make a good ruler:

1. Shes not wanted. With the possible exception of Dorne Dany has no true support in Westeros. There are no people screaming out to be liberated, there are no people remembering Targaryan rule fondly, just various houses that have got themselves into trouble and need her help. Tyrion, Varys and, before he died, Barriston are the only major characters from Westeros who genuinly support her, Barriston is dead and Tyrion and Varys spent season 7 learning that she wasnt the wise and virtuous leader they thought she was. 

2. The North wants to be independent. The only Kingdom where we have a strong idea of their internal politics doesnt want to be ruled by Kings landing. Jon bent the knee but that is already an unpopular decision in the North and he only did it because he thought he had no choice.

3. Shes allied with the Dothraki. The Dothraki are incredibly useful but they are not politically easy to justify. Their entire culture is built around ruling through force and stealing from their rivals. Danys association with them is extremely unpopular in Westeros.

4. Dany is cruel. With almost no exceptions Danys instinct is to kill her rivals and has only ever been talked down from taking this action by her advisors. In the show, most of her actions are justifiable, but not all..

5. She executed the Tarleys. This is where Danys faade crumbles, there was no justification for what she did to Randyll and Dickon. People try and say this is OK for a few reasons, they point out that Randyll is a bit of an ar\*ehole, but not liking someone is no justification for killing them. They say he betrayed Olenna but he only turned on her after she turned on the crown, she was the traitor, not Randyll. They say its OK to kill prisoners of war, its not, in the medieval ages executing captured nobles was considered despicable and Tyrion and Varys reaction to this event confirms that. They say she offered them a choice but for someone whos against slavery the choice of serve me or die is hypocritical, she literally wanted to force them into servitude.

6. Her motivation is self serving. Since the moment Viserys was killed Dany has wanted the throne for herself. Shed never even set foot on Westeros before season 7, she doesnt know whats best for the Kingdom, she just knows she wants to rule it. 

Conclusion

Dany wants to rule the seven kingdoms, she doesnt want to do it for virtuous reasons, she wants to do it because she believes its her birth right. Her true nature is to take what she wants and kill anyone who gets in her way, yes she can be nice, but only when its in her own interests. I believe the people of Westeros will reject Danys leadership and rally behind Jon believing him to be a better choice with a stronger claim. This will lead to conflict between Jon and Dany, Jon will feel duty bound to become King and will plead with Dany to renounce her claim, she will refuse leading to the shows ultimate conflict, Westeros versus Dany.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

-Robb was killed by the Frey's, so was Grey Wind.
-Rickon was killed by the Bolton's and his allies, so was Shaggydog

It's quite plausible then, that the other Starks will go the same as their direwolves. Whilst Summer sacrificed themselves to the Walkers, it's likely that Bran will have to as the three eyed raven, just as his predecessor did. Lady was killed out of mercy by her own family. Perhaps Sansa goes a bit drunk on power like the mad king and cersei did (we've already seen her likeness to Queen Cersei), and Arya has to kill her. Jon stays alive with Ghost, the most powerful of the Direwolves, and Arya lives as a free woman/wolf like Nymeria. 

They say that all Starks have the wolf blood in them and all possess the power to Warg. Bran already confirms that. Why not the other Starks? What does everyone think?",230,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was hoping someone could answer these questions i have:

\- When Ned Stark watches Arya train with Syrio, there is a very brief moment where Ned smiles and suddenly looks concerned after Syrio looks at him. (look at 3:17) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rwPa3H1MFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rwPa3H1MFU)  
Why is that?

\- Syrio calls Arya 'boy' all the time, now there is this scene (at 0:25) he says 'look at me, you remember me now boy' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dkj3siztkc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dkj3siztkc) could this in any way be related to Syrio? Since i can't remember anyone else calling Arya boy all the time 

\- Who is this 'Quaithe'? And how come she knows so much and looks so intimidating? Not only that but she says she is 'no one', is she one of the faceless? And even if she is, how come she knows so much? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fZqh-qw\_0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fZqh-qw_0M)

\- Why did the white walkers ignore Samwell? (At 2:51) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6yoS3LFIFM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6yoS3LFIFM)

\- Varys took hold of the sorcerer who took his manhood, what did he do to him? What happened to that guy?

\- Arya was given 3 people to have executed, why the fuck did she not choose anyone on her list? They have refered to this question twice in the series and each time, Arya has dodged the question (At 31:00) this seems very weird to me

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BggNw2lY6yg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BggNw2lY6yg)

So we get things like ""All the Starks are doomed to die - Robb and Rickon are dead, Jon died, Sansa lost her innocence/Sansa will die, Bran became the 3ER/Bran will die and Arya became no one"", and so on.

But the point of Arya's arc is that she didn't become no one. She could never let go of her past, and when Jaqen told her she was ready to become ""no one"", she literally rebuffed him by saying who she was. Ever since, she has been motivated entirely by her familial ties. Just because she's learned to use Needle and she can do some illusion magic, doesn't mean she's stopped being Arya.

I know I know, she was a brat in the beggining of the series and her being blinded by Joffrey caused trouble but, how come people easily forgave Jaime for **pushing a child out of a window** but can't seem to forgive Sansa for being a kid herself when the series started? Some people get as far as to blame her for Ned's death.... which makes no sense to me.

Also, Arya is a fan favourite and I have read people calling Arya the only true Stark girl. People love Arya and despise Sansa. Even in the show, Arya put the guilt on her and told her she had been playing princess while she had endured so much in her journey. But, hey... wasn't Sansa sold, raped and phisically/psychologically tortured? I don't believe Arya would have survived Sansa's story... the same way I don't believe Sansa would've survived Arya's. Both were little girls that had to grow up in horrible places and both survived using the skills they had. Sansa endured, Arya fought. But ultimately both were brave.

Don't get me wrong, the Jaime arc is one of my favourites and I love the development he has had. But it seems kinda hypocritical to me that grown men can redeem themselves but little kids can't. I also freaking love Arya because she is amazing. Nonetheless, Sansa is one of my favourite characters (my fave was Margie and we all know how that turned out) and I think she's not only one of the smartest, she has also had some amazing moments, despite all the thing she has gone through.

Why do you think some people tend to judge her that hard and seem to be understanding of most characters motives and past actions, while at the same time, they berate Sansa for her past?",72,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Phan pheory,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ahi03d/spoilers_the_red_womans_prophecy_in_season_7_phan/,marucentsay,1547865623,"I had this theory bug me for days and it might be a naive one, but please do tell me what you think. 

So in season 7 Melisandre and Daenerys meet fo the first time and she speaks the following prophecy:

The Long Night is coming, only the Prince Who Was Promised can bring the dawn.""

And Missandei corrects her saying that the word prince in high valerian has no gender. Daenerys is comforted by that. However, we also saw Melisandre call Jon the prince that was promised.  

Another detail is the fact the Dany is an actual queen and Jon is also a king. Neither of them are prince or princess. But what happens when a king and a queen have babies? They have princes and princesses.  

We know that Daenerys was told she will never have kids, or in other words:

when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves, when your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child

We know that the weather in the series is not scientific, as G.R.R. Martin said himself, so maybe after the long night this time the sun will change where it sets and where it rises? Or perhaps it might be a less literal prophecy? 

What do you guys think?

All credit to Talking Thrones and his contributors on this one. I honestly believe this is the one, folks. Its extremely well researched and sourced from the books, and very well laid out. Cant recommend this theory video enough. Ive been a fan of Talking Thrones for a couple years now, and this theory may be his crown jewel. 

Ive increasingly been getting more on board with the Bran is the NK theory train the last 6 months. Ive watched a lot of really good theory videos out there, and a lot of really crazy ones. This one isnt one of those. This one is methodical, highly detailed, and in my opinion lays out exactly what is going to happen to bring the NK down. If TT is right about this, the ending has been staring us in the face for years now, right out in the open. 

Id love to explain it, but this is a 24 minute video and its so very detailed and concise, I simply do not believe I could do it justice even if I TL;DR formatted it. Aside from the video and theory being well worth a watch, he deserves the views for putting this together, and I wouldnt want to take that from him by butchering this theory in an attempt to explain it here. 

Id love to see everyone watch it, then come back and comment what you think here. The beauty of this theory is TT doesnt even come right out and say it. He simply lays out all the source material in such a way that by the time you finish watching it, what hes saying and proposing is the endgame for the NK, many of the Starks, and Winterfell itself, it will be so apparent it will probably upset you that its been right there, looking us right in the eyes and hiding in plain sight all these years and it just never hit you.

Daenerys has the North and presumably their allies in the Vale..but I'm  wondering with the extinction of Dany's allies in the Reach and Dorne...are they still technically part of her kingdom or unaffiliated.

No one saw the dead body Rhaegar Targaryen.

Rhaegar Targaryen is born of fire and loved by Ice. His death is never describe in detail but only mentioned about falling rubies and his body was not found. If his body was not found then what happened with it?

The theory is after the battle with king Robert. He gone  to beyond wall to the third eye raven, his own blood to saved his live. but the things turns ugly with the chlidren of forest + Third eye raven.

Did anyone else feel the strong similarities between the dynamic of Lev and Kolya as Tyrion and Jamie? Kolya was the ultra confident warrior who took a shine to the mercurial/intelligent virgin Lev and protected and looked out for him much like how Jamie did for Tyrion. Also Vika had extremely similar characteristics to Arya, right down to her wolf eyes.

I'm blown away by how multi-talented David Benioff is. Really curious to read some of his other novels now. I like that ASOIF could have possibly crept into his subconscious in building these great characters, as he was obviously a huge fan of the series.

Pretty hilarious looking back on this quote from 2008: ""What are you working on now? Im doing a series at HBO. A crappy way of describing it would be The Sopranos in Middle Earth.

Took me an entire night of research, pot, and the delusion that I am Sherlock Holmes, but I think I might have got something here.. 


I just had a mind blowing moment while working on a different theory. Just realised that the true enemies have been hidden all along. The wisest person in the whole story is the [**fool**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface). He is the one saying the world is upside down! Meaning people get dirty by water(**Ironmen**), they clean by fire(**Targaryens**), and of course, the most obvious thing of all, **kings** are in fact the **pawns** in this game, and whom they think they have power over (**the old slaves**, **the priests**, **the actors who can be anyone** , **the faceless men**, **the frankenstenian doctors** ) **are** actually the ones **in charge**, manipulating them, and **whispering** in their ears! It isn't the **Night King** who is the bad guy here. What he is doing is actually trying to **save the world!** Because to t**he others**, **the shadows**, that would not exist without fire, to them **only death matters**. 

My whole idea starts from this. You know how **Melissandre** always says **the night is dark and full of terrors**? How **only light** can fight darkness? Well, there is one eternal light, indeed, which comes from the obsidian(**dragon**) **glass**. That is **the only eternal flame**. The one that we saw to actually give **immortality**(White walkers)  The fire? That is actually the cause for darkness! **Fire burns** everything to ash, **even** stone(or **[stone people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A&amp;t=19s)**), leaving nothing behind... ([not even stone can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)). **The Night King has** no choice but **to fight the fire** that is threatening the entire world and he can only do that **with ice**, with **people whose frozen hearts** cannot be tricked by wizardsand sourcerers. He is like the sprinkle that turns on when you have been tricked into burning your entire house down. [One of the first visions The Night King( in the show at least) Bran has.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY)

Remember how **the witch** had told Danny she would **never** have other **sons**? What [rituals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwO4864ZFhc) she did to Khal Drogo? **She wasn't lying.** **Khal Drogo**'s **life** paid for the life of Danny's **dragons**([He was a King after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R5L7cRkkQ)), but they are not her [**babies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACHEISPQohY). She will not have other sons, the witch had told her! If she had only listened to **[Jorah](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegal)** who asked her to** sell them!
**
No.. the dragons are not her babies.. Jon sees them for what they are. Beautiful **Beasts** (""[Not to me they aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNV4vywsgsY)"") 
But to everyone else they are! And to some, they are something else... 




**Tools** used by the [red priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LvhZb3RgM), from the [faceless men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vwd_hrwYJg), who have used them against Valyria itself(*Euron gives his brother Victarion the dragon horn when he sends the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet to Meereen to bring Daenerys Targaryen back to him.*  Dragon horn got from where? We will see soon..) and [they have controlled Danny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp1i0WIphWg) to get her on that path to fulfill their mission. This is why, as her beasts grow bigger, the magic of the warlocks and the red priests grows stronger as well(and faceless men too...) 

......


Realising that **fire** is actually **evil** (can be used in bad ways like her father almost did, dragons can get out of control), and R'hlor  and Melissandre , and all the **priests** which have been in her life **since the beginning**, are actually evil, like Satan([Arstan](http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arstan_Selmy)).  Daenerys will have the choice to continue as did all the ** mad Targaryens**, ruling by fire, or sacrifice herself and die, to be **reborn** again by the **eternal flame** of real light, **dragon glass**. As  [Night Queen](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Night%27s_Queen),**reunited**,  her faith resembling that of **her dragon**, Viserion(named after** her brother**, [Viserys], the boy that was tricked by the people he had thought his servants into selling his sister for a [ golden crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akl6OK2HUNA) . The fact he died in the city where it's forbidden to kill anyone goes to show the power and influence the red priests/faceless men had already around Danny). The fact that he **died by fire** is only natural, since D.D. himself has confirmed it that [**Targaryens are not immune to fire!**](https://www.quora.com/In-Game-of-Thrones-or-the-book-are-all-Targaryens-immune-to-fire) . The only times **Daenerys survives** without getting burned is because each time she is doing **sacrifices to R'hllor**, without even realising.

**
In the beginning** it is said that the **men and the white walkers had peace**. A few things were demanded by the Night King back then.. among them was that a **Stark** will **marry a dead Queen** because.. **A Stark** Must always be **in the North** who **keeps** the **vengeful spirits in their crypts*** . That **babies** of **male** descent will be offered as **sacrifice**(Because the Night Queen can't have any babies). Which is what **Craster** does beyond the wall. The fact that Craster only offers the son born out of **incest** with his own daughter is already a huge send-back to the **Targaryen** way of doing things. So it was obviously meant for Daenerys to be the Ice Queen. The Mother of the Ice Dragon.  From spitting fire to spitting ice.** A song of Ice and Fire**, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.

.............



Some think the faceless men have been the ones responsible for the Doom of Valyria. We know (in the books) that a faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons. People assumed that it is for knowing how to kill a dragon. But the only way to kill a dragon is with another dragon, I can tell you that. (Or a good javelin thrower) It was also said that Euron might have paid a faceless man to kill Balon Greyjoy. But a faceless man doesn't come cheap! However, Euron also said he once had a dragon egg but on a whim, because he couldn't hatch it, just got angry and threw it in the sea. Well, I highly doubt Euron would actually do that, considering the worth of an egg, even useless...Would you?


So if the [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men, who brought the doom on the old Valyria, had a dragon of their own they would be pretty strong. Tie that in with Danny's dragons, and no one could stop them from doing whatever they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4)! And what they want is only to please the **God of Death**. Which, at this point, I have to say I am pretty sure is the same God that **Melissandre** makes sacrifices to. Don't forget where the faceless men started. **Fiery mines**. **Fiery Gods**. Bringing the **mercy of death** **to** people in **suffering**. **Whispering** a few encouraging words** in their ears**. In fact their saying is the same, **All men must die**(**slavers and masters too**). But Melissandre isn't the only **sorcerer** working for the Lord of **Light** either.




What I think is something more hidden here is that **Varys**(who reminds me a lot of [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), the **auspicious** one, the **destroyer** )himself is a **faceless man** a mummer, who, just like Arya, after being sold by a Red priest, was found by a faceless man and was thought how to become no one. That is why Varys can go by everywhere unnoticed. Why he always wears disguises . He is the one suggesting that **Barristan Selmy** be removed from the King's Guard(because he needs him for another job somewhere). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan to help Daenerys, is actually just **one of the spider's tricks** at the behest of one of Barristan's oldest friend, and rival.

.........................
""Ah. **The children**. [It's **always** the innocents who suffer..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJvhQ9-lsA) 

It was **your mercy** that killed The King"", says Varys to Ned in the dungeon. ""***Promise me, Ned..***"" He is also the one telling Ned from the beginning how **the king is doomed** and he must help him. **Varys** releases Tyrion, who further kills ""his"" father, unknowingly, or perhaps on purpose fullfilling the wish of The Read Vyper(who had died for Tyrion, but also trying to bring Tywin to justice).

So the red priests might have been grooming and manipulating Danny without her knowledge since the very beginning. Robert would never get to them because Varys would make sure of it. Varys always said he serves for the good of the people. Why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from burning the Starks? Or wanting to burn the whole city?  There is no way he did not know about the wild fire under the entire city. Or at least  try and save Ellaria's kids. He did none of that. Despite claiming to work for the good of the Targaryens, and of the realm, the faceless men would not forget the fiery pits o fold Vailyria.


Remember the **Tragedy at Summerhall**? Pyromancers and wildfire causing an entire generation of Targaryen's to perish, including one Lord Comman, known as **Ser Duncan the Tall**,  the **Lord Commander** of the Kingsguard.. Sounds like how this could have went had **Jamie** not stepped in..

""**Jon Connington**, whom he had squired with, was a **good friend to Rhaegar** as well. Returning from a trip to Dorne, Rhaegar once visited the Connington seat of Griffin's Roost. [His songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnZtJ1H7hjg) brought the castle's women to tears, while Lord Armond Connington sought House Targaryen's support against rival House Morrigen."" **What we know about Jon Connington?** That he served as hand of the King. That he fought Robert Baratheon(not such a skilled warrior) in battle and **lost** and has then left to Essos, where it was believed that he drank himself to death. How is it though, that **Jon Connington could not find Robert Baratheon ** who was hiding in a **brothel**?
&gt; *
&gt; George R.R. Martin has confirmed that one of the POV characters in A Dance with Dragons is gay and it is implied that this is Jon, who was in love with Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Jon refers to Rhaegar as his ""**[silver prince](https://youtu.be/SCuXe2ZZAkU)**"" when he reminisces about him, and Jon believed Rhaegar's wife, Elia Martell, to have been unworthy of him.* 
History does tend to repeat itself, doesn't it? And it's always about love too, just like Danny's third betrayal..""The whispers became a swirling song three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love"".


This is not the full truth however. While Ser Jon Connington is gay, the important part here is that he is not the only one. My belief is that Ser **Barristan The Bold**, just like **Brienne**, an honest knight, loved his prince and would have served him until the end. True to his word, he took Rhaegar's place on the battlefield. Against him, out of jealousy, and fighting under Robert Baratheon's name was non other than **Jon Connington**. My certainty of this is the siege where Robert Baratheon had been **hiding** in a brothel when **Jon** was searching for him. Just like [Loras was searching for Renly Baratheon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2aCUUVw5T0), I presume. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Rhaegar's closest and oldest friend, however, was Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, trusting him more than Ser Barristan Selmy.""

**Ser Duncan** had fought and defeated **Ser Barristan Selmy** when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress Ashara Dayne who, as he said, he loved, as much as everyone. . He was wearing a mask, but when they saw him, Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give him a chance, just for a laugh most likely. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. A boy, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how Barristan got his nickname ""The bold""... They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**.

&gt; Rhaegar often liked to visit the **ruins of Summerhall** with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce [women](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne) to tears

**Looking back**, Barristan was pretty embarassed at the tourney. Years later, at just **16**, Barristan defeated Ser Duncan the Tall and Prince Duncan the Small, just like **Brienne**, from the island of **saphires**, [defeatead  **Ser Loras Tyrel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU) . 

We know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. Why would they do that? We know that Robert has fought against Barristan before and lost..

&gt; Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 


According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**. The same day, **Jon** is born. Are we really to believe that the person who died at the Trident was really Rhaegar?


What else is there in Ser Barristan's life? [The Harrenhal tournament](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Harrenhal). Where **Rhaegar** fell for **Lyanna**, which led to the Great War. It was at Harrenhal's tournament that [Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLUI6GxwNxk).

&gt; 
&gt; at the Storms End tourney Barristan was able to unhorse **Lord Robert Baratheon**, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord Jon Connington, Lord Jason Mallister, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
 
Now do you really think Robert Baratheon, who was just in one tourney before in his life, where he **lost to Barristan Selmy**, could have ever defeated Selmy himself or **Rhaegar Targaryen** at the **Trident**? I highly doubt that. 

 
In fact we hear of even moreshameful defeat, on behalf of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Well, The Red Vyper, always with the wisdom. Because the mind behind the House of Garden is in fact [Mace Tyrell,](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface) and not his mother, the Queen of Thorns. If you pay attention, Mace manages to get a position on the council, and also go in mission to the Bank of Braavos, managing to secure audience




Which is why he had **other warriors fight in his place**, or in his armour, for him.. which is how he gave **Robert Baratheon** to use Selmy.. **Rhaegar** was a **fierce warrior**. Who else could they get that would even match the only person who defeated Arthur Dayne. The next best thing, his friend, **Barristan Selmy**, who hated him, for stealing [**Ashara**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne). After Robert's Rebellion, **believing** that her lover **Rhaegar** has **died**, **she kills herself**.


Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw) on this world are almost the exact words he tells Ned when he is defeated at the battle of Ashford: ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" .. ""You'll rule.. you'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl... Varys, Littlefinger, my brother.. No one to tell me no but you.. only you! (No to Lyanna) 

**""Let her live..."" ""Stop it if it's not to late"" ""My son(thinking Lyanna is pregnant with .. help him Ned. Make him better than me"".** ""My memory... King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig..""


So Ashara's lover couldn't have been Ned. Ashara killed herself for Rhaegar.. Too bad that Barristan Selmy loved her...

Other than that, other victims of Ser **Barristan** Sell me were [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight),  another **masked** knight who is , with his first original **brotherhood**, killed with the help of Arthur Dayne. His last words to Arthur Dayne were that he just wanted to take a **look** at his [Valyrian steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBhFLWopJa8)... Who knows, perhaps he knew where it came from.. [Arthur Dayne showed it to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkPxHxcP3Q) 
&gt; 
&gt; "" **That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne**, but someplace along the way **he had become the [Smiling Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish)** instead.*"" (Jamie Lannister)  This works for both oath breakers..


Other **Barristan Selmy victims**? Surprisingly, all **masked warriors**. Except for [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who most likely was used as **a pawn** to kidnap the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) . He was said to have also killed ***Maelys I Blackfyre*** , the last of the **Blackfyre pretender**s, called Monstrous for supposedly having **eaten his twin in the womb**,  making him a  **kinslayer**.


&gt;  ""**Aegon the Unworthy** legitimized all his **bastard**s on his deathbed. Inevitably the greatest of these, [Daemon Blackfyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuDu43Gnyts), declared himself the rightful heir, and ignited yet another war for the crown.""

Yeah, no. Sir Selmy is a Blackfyre.

&gt; 


We can see why House Martell will have their reasons  to betray the **Targaryens**, who were **in bed with Dorne**, just like they do with the [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bIQ4Hh8Bo\)).

&gt;  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.


As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men are very simmilar to R'hllor, whom Melissandre prays to. Fire brings death after all, and darkness.

These **faceless men** was said to have appeared and  fought against the [**Old  Valyria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-T6ICuywY). **Whispering** encouraging words into  **slaves** ears(**All men must die**) who wanted a **swift death** instead of suffering in the **burning** pits. **From where only the Targaryens escaped**..

&gt; ""What's your name, **friend**?""... ""Qy**burn**.."" ""You're lucky to be **alive**..."" ""***Lucky***?"" 

Qyburn, who was supposedly kicked out of the Citadel for experimenting.. Who manages to find his way from Roose Bolton's ear to Cersei's...

**The Red priests** have always been involved in the Targaryen lives. When **Danny** was a kid, with Viserys, they always got away from Robert's(or Varys') assassins. How? **Ser Willem Darry** was a knight from House Darry who served as the **Red Keep's master-at-arms**. He was the one who **saved** both **Daenerys** and **Viserys** after the rebellion. **The house** where they lived, she remembers, **had a red door**. It also had a **lemon tree** in a place where lemons couldn't grow, suggesting there was **magic** involved. When Danny thought of these things, Ser Willem would suddenly appear in the room, leaning on his stick, and probably distract her. 

Some of the first scenes we see with Varys is when he is walking in a dungeon with Iliryo, amongst the bones of the dragons, conspiring. Varys is a spider, as they said. His story about loosing his manhood? Not even true, if you think you can't believe a word from his mouth...


**Ilyrio** **sold** **Daenerys** **to Khal Drogo** and gave her **three dragon eggs** as a **wedding gift** that would help bring the **doom upon Westeros** , just like Vayria of Old... Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called **The Tragedy at Summerhall**. 

&gt; *""**the blood of the dragon** **gathered** **in one** **seven eggs**, **to honour the seven gods**, though **the king's own septon had warned**: **pyromancers**, **wild fire** ... **flames grew out of control**, towering, burned so hot that  **died**, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...""* (Ser Duncan The Tall had managed, with the cost of his own life, to save a few people out of the fires. But where was Sir Barristan Selmy) 

How fortunate that the **three dragon eggs** would end up in **Illyrio Mopatis's hands**, **Varys's friend**! **The spider** who played with fire.**The** good **thief**. The one who most certainly knew about all the secret passages where the Mad King might have stored wild fire..) And what **a trap** that was for the Tyrel's at **the Red Keep!** That was because The Red Keep had started **worshipping other Gods**..The **wildfire** under the Red Keep  is **the light** which R'hllor uses to **destroy the Seven Gods worshippers**. All **trapped** in one place. All **offerings to the God of Fire and Death**. Qyburn is there to kill  Maester Pycelle as well..Pycelle is confused.. He has been faithful to the Red God, to the Lanissters as well..

&gt; ""It pains me, my lord..whatever your faults, you don't deserve to die alone, in such a cold, dark place..But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.."" Qyburn and Varys's [little mute devils](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silence) then proceed to stab Pycelle. 

All the kids stabbed him with hatred. With revenge.. The kid who stabs Lancel Lannister looks like he feels remorse..for a Lannister. Stabs him once and runs away. But how did Qyburn just take over Varys's little whisperers? Who were said to be mute! How did he understand them?


&gt; ""While whispers of a certain eunuch's talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king."" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)
&gt; 

Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....


Although **Daenerys** freed the people, she was still a **ruler** who would pride herself in her **old Valiryan blood**,and who would [cheat a merchant man of his price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpwtoHv8E6k), as if her cause excuses the deed. Her **Unsullied**, although forgotten, are quite the cruel warriors. In order to become Unsullied, they **must kill a baby**. Could this be an **offering to R'hllorl**? We also know that their **manhoods** are **cut off**. The same thing that happened to **Varys**.


[Missandei and Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9icZ9sfyvk) had been with **Daenerys** since she **took** over **the Unsullied** [by force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXpHvhjUzAI). **Three times** she will be betrayed. Third time is for **love**.... **Missandrei** had never taken off her slave ring from around her neck. Who is to say it was a slave ring to begin with? Her clothes do look very simmilar to the actual **merchant** who wants to sell her **Daenerys** the **Unsullied she can't afford**.. She wasn't a slave to begin with, and just **like Mirri Maz Duur**, she **could not be freed by Daenerys**. She did not need her freedom to begin with. [Look how they act in this scene with Varys](https://youtu.be/pJP9o6QMk-E), who has not been long there. ""So it's safe to say that a **fragile peace** has taken hold...""  ""***For now..***"" ""For now is the best we get in our profession""(nods at Missandei and [Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3w6c7RUbUs) and they both look at each other and then [straighten their backs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHJTYqLtRms&amp;t=31s) when Tyrion starts speaking..) Perhaps Grey Worm, as the leader of the Unsullied, was even spared his part...

&gt; ""**Grey Worm** gives this one **pride**. It is a **lucky** name. The name this one was born with was **cursed**. That was the name he had when he was taken as a **slave**. But **Grey Worm** is the name **this one** had **the day Daenerys** Stormborn **set him free**"" 

The leader of the Unsullied, with his perfect love story with Missandei, who was just an interpreter for the Masters of Astapor did not need freeing. Just like Mirri Maz Duur did not need her liberation.



You wanna know something else though?The one who truly loves Daenerys is Rhaegar.. You wanna know who **Rhaegar** is? The one who loved her from the [very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80KwlfqfRWk). Who did not tell her about the Varys plot, because he knew Varys was **caring for her.** We know that **Jorah** Mormont, **the bear**, who used to live in Essos, got exiled for selling slaves. right around Robert's Rebellion and he fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark. We later find out that Robert, and Varys, still keep in touch with Jorah, and use him to get to Daenerys. Except he seems like he has a change of heart. Except we then find out that Varys did not want to harm Danny either.  Except it's all BS! The  only reason why Jorah declines to take Longclaw is because that is not his father's sword! No. Why **Robert** is bitter after all this years.. Because HE **LOST AT THE TRIDENT.** But Rhaegar, seeing that the war was lost, asked him to spare him, and his family, and he will spare Robert. He unfortunately can't save Jon because he is protected by Ned, so that is why Jorah runs away from Ned! Knowing that if he went there he would have had to kill the honourable Ned. 

That  Bear Mormont's sword.. sworn brother of the Night's Watch, who never had kids. That belongs to Jon Snow. Because Jeor Mormont never had any kids. Or if he had, then he himself was a Targaryen, staying there to defent the realm of men! Why do I say these things? Because I will put my hand in a fire if that smooth ass silk Jorah Mormont is not Rhaegar Targaryen! Have you ever heard of him?  (*He was stripped of his Lordship and fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark* The only true thing on Jorah's wikipedia)


In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his father and brother died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then he got   spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister (who had once been one of his closest friends, but who, looking at Rains of Castamere is not a man to be messed with). The rest is a history of fire and blood. 

What do we know about **Azor Ahai**? He is the hero prohecised by the Red Priests..But it seems that every region had their own saviours who helped them through **the Long Night**. The Northerners say it was the Last Hero who joined the children of the Forestand won the battle for the Dorne against The Others(not the white walkers).  
**Descendants of the Rhoynar**? A **hero** convinced their gods to** bring back** the day with the [**secret song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swbGk7kw75U). **The YiTi** people say [a woman with a monkey's tail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SM3x2taiU) **restored the sun**(*The Night King could never reach the sun, as much as he wanted. Red Priests however...*) 



And that's why Daenerys has to become the Ice Queen.

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart. The night King only uses dead as an army just because the don't have a heart. The reason why Jon doesn't fall for Melissandre's tricks either. 

The book covers are a give away as well. Notice how A feast for Crows is in fiery read, with a cheremonial chalice, reminding of the one Melissandre would offer to drink from? You then have A Game of thrones where the rulers will be the frozen ones and what seems to be a Valyrian steel sword.. A helmet(like the Mountains), against a [green field(the dothraki)A shiny golden crown to go with some shiny golden Lannister  hair or perhaps those colours were of sand and not of gold.. and a white shield with one sole dragon, protecting the realm. 


Final Edit: If I turn out to be right (which I bet anyone a case of beer that I am!), from then on you will refer to me as The three-eyed-raven. If I am not right, that's fine. You don't know how I am anyway. Besides, I know a god who knows how to change faces. The [ONE TRUE GOD!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDnW5XxjwI8) It is known..(**Also, guys, D, and D. D., Name's D. M. If I'm write about J.M.  being R..,  cast me in the next season! I'm fine with just a cameo**)



*Cue to the future, Dream of Spring, when Samwise Gamgee.. I mean Maester Samwell L L Tarly is  writing all this down in ""The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros"" or as the free folk will call it,  A song of ice and fire: when the living danced with the dead.*

Jon did not forgive Olly for his betrayal. He would not forget Daenerys's assassination.. Ned's words come to his mind though..

**TL;DR** **The Night King** is the **good** guy, sort of(Wants or demands to be served). **R'hllor and the red priests/faceless men** only want to bring **death** to people, slaves and masters alike(All men must die). Just like Patchface is saying.. the whole world is upside down! The **kings** are the **pawns**, and those who we think are serving us(the priests, the doctors/faceless men, the banks) are in fact ruling us, while the most holy think we **all must die** to clean ourselves of our sins.. The wise(Maesters) are the fools, and the fools are the wise(Patchface). Daenerys is not the Queen of Fire, but of Ice. She just need to realise that her third betrayal is the thing she loves the most. **Fire**. Caused Old Valyria to fall, cause her family to be corrupt by its power. Oh, and **Rhaegar** is alive. His name is **Jorah**. He was** the prince that was promised**. The **brother** who will **kill Cersei**.   Ironically,like the fool said the poisoners of Westeros, the dornish, are the people you can trust. **The Mountain**, the most **courageous**  and **mindless fighter of R'hllor**,  vs. **The Hound**, **scared** and  **scarred by fire**, **saved by** Ray, a veteran of the War of the Ninepenny Kings, and worshipper of **the Seven**,  will happen.. 

&gt;   ""Oh, there's **plenty of pious sons of bitches** who **think they know the word of god**, or gods. I don't. I don't know  **their real names.** **Maybe** it is the Seven. Or **maybe** it's the Old Gods. Or **maybe** it's the Lord of Light, or **maybe they're all the same fucking thing**. I don't know. **What matters, I believe, is** that **there's something** **greater** than us.  **And whatever it is, it's got plans** for Sandor Clegane.""

I know I probably shouldn't have to say it, but I still kindof have too since a lot of people think since Bran is not in the crypts in the new tease and also that we see the mist of winter come down that it must be foreshadowing for him being the NK, and even without that some people still think he could be the NK. But personally I DON'T think he is, as I feel that would ruin Bran's character and also the theory it self doesn't make any since. Not to mention if Bran IS the NK the motivation for why he wants to attack does not make any sense.

As for the Crypts thing, well first of all he may not be able to get down there due to the fact he is in a wheel chair and also he is also not a Stark anymore or even bran, he is the 3ER. So that is why he is not down there most likely. Now I will say though I think Bran may have caused the creation of the Night King, now I am not saying he is the NK but I think Bran may have unknowingly caused the Night King's creation. Perhaps in some point in S8 bran after the first battle in WF Bran decides to try and prevent the NK's creation by whispering into a First man of everything that will happen in the future.

Bran watches the First man go to warn the children they don't believe him and tie him up to a Weirwood and put some robe in his mouth, and Bran sees them but Dragonglass into his chest/heart and Bran realizes this man is the Night King, and that he unknowingly caused his creation. Not only this create another hold the door situation that could tie into NK's defeat, but also it would explain the tie bran has too the Night King. Maybe when Bran did this a small part of Bran went into the Night King, NOT his entire self and I am still saying he is the Night King but maybe when he caused his creation a small part of himself went into the Night King, Meaning Bran may have to die so the NK will be weakened enough for Jon to defeat him.

I do believe there was a reason Bran gave Arya that Dagger, maybe because he knows Arya will have to kill him with that Dagger.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

He passed away in November of 2018 and will never know how the books/show will end. I am sharing this here because most people in my life don't get how the series has imprinted many different emotions for me now and with season 8 creeping in, it's not only the ending that is going to be bittersweet, but for me it's going to be much more. 

He lived 6 hours away and couldn't afford cable or wifi in recent years. I bought him a tablet and for the last two seasons he would go to McDonalds early every Monday morning, drink coffee and watch GOT on the tablet using their wifi. He would then call me later that day and discuss the episode with me. He had a bad hip, so sitting that long in those chairs was hard on him. 

  He didn't just do this because he loved the show, but because he loved to connect and share a common passion with me. It was another example of how much I meant to him and this new season is one of many reminders of how much he means to me. 

I can't wait for April, but at the same time it's going to be a rough season without him. Good thing I have this sub to ride it all out with! You guys are awesome and I love reading all the posts and sharing in all the episode reactions every season. Thank you for that.",82,1,False,self,,,,,

The wisest person in the whole story is the [**fool**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface). He realises that everything is upside down. Meaning people get **dirty by water**(**Ironmen**), they **clean by fire**(**Targaryens**), that **kings** are in fact the **pawns** and the real power is in the hands of   **the old slaves**, **the priests**, **the actors** , **the faceless men**, **the frankenstenian doctors** . who can manipulate and corrupt [Kings](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen) and [Lords](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister) alike, by **[whispering](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Master_of_Whisperers)**into their ears.
&gt; One green and three black candles were brought to the Citadel from Valyria a thousand years before the Doom of Valyria.(white becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world). It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart. 

**The others**, are **the shadows**, that would not exist without fire, without sacrifices, to them **only death matters**. But the Night King also as his own Others.. [Ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfvRmtRMEGc) and [Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XflLYW-t2Z4), even The Water of the Drowned God all bring one thing. Death. . It corrupts those who think they master it, and their Gods always demand that their [worshippers give their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IccqnH7VJjk) to them and be **born again**. Some just lose their minds..


&gt; ""Hodor, hodor..""-Hodor

**Wylis's mind** died at that **gate**. He became a  fool called **Hodor**.. but the **fools** are **not** all that **they seem** in this story(Mace included)... Hodor would still react to things..**someone was still up there**, even if Wylis died.. Someone who can control minds..


&gt; The king  **the old king**, **Aerys II** Targaryen, who **had not been quite so mad in those days**, had sent his lordship **to seek a bride** **for Prince Rhaegar**, who had no sisters to wed(yet).. **We have bought his freedom** and hope to bring him home with us. **Robert will be delighted with him**, and perhaps in time he will even teach **Stannis how to laugh** (Maester Cressen regrets that Patchface  never did teach Stannis to laugh)

In his youth, Patchface was a clever boy with astonishing wit; after his accident, however, his **mind and body** are **broken**. After his **survival** from the **shipwreck** he is described as soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles and has a [weird sideways walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRR59EK9zz0). 
The ship that was supposed to bring back Rhaegar's bride was probably sunk by a sea monster controlled by the same person who took Patchface's wits.
&gt; 
&gt;  **That creature is dangerous.** Many a time I have glimpsed him in my flames. Sometimes there are s**kulls about him**, and his **lips are red with blood**. - Melisandre to Jon Snow(about Patchface or Hodor?)

[Only light](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Glass_candle) can fight darkness.   ([not even stone(people) can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)).

[One of the first visions The Night King Bran The Builder has.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY) is of the Mad King wanting to burn them all, and of the **Night King** **giving life** to a baby, then of **his father,** Ned,  **dying** by **the hand** of Ilyn Payne, **old Mad King**'s man... 

**The Night King** only **awoke** when the **Mad King** started **burn**ing **Starks**(*as a sacrifice to whom I wonder*).. 

&gt; ""When the **sun rises** in the **west** and **sets in the east**,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the **seas** **go dry** and **mountains blow** in the wind **like leaves**. When **your womb quickens again**, and you **bear** a **living child**.  **Then he will return**, and not before.""

The [rituals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwO4864ZFhc) the witch performed on **Khal Drogo** were offerings to the Red God, and paid for the life of Danny's **dragons**([He was a King after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R5L7cRkkQ)), but they are not her [**babies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACHEISPQohY).  **Viserys**, was **tricked by**  the people he had thought **his servants** into **selling  his sister** for a [ golden crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akl6OK2HUNA).

&gt; 
&gt;  ""Beautiful **Beasts**"" (""[Not to me they aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNV4vywsgsY)"") 
 

**Beasts** used by the [red priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LvhZb3RgM), from the [faceless men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vwd_hrwYJg), who have used them against Valyria itself. This is why, as her beasts grow bigger, the magic of the warlocks and the red priests grows stronger as well(and faceless men too...) 

&gt; The **dragonlords of old Valyria** had controlled their mounts with **binding spells** and **sorcerous horns**. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip.




**In the beginning** it is said that the **men and the white walkers had peace**. A few things were demanded by the Night King back then.. among them was that a **Stark** will **marry a dead Queen** because.. **A Stark** Must always be **in the North** who **keeps** the **vengeful spirits in their crypts*** .
&gt; ""For thirteen years, **he** and **his Queen** ruled over **his brothers**, making **sacrifices** **as black as their cloaks**.""(**Ygritte**, **the free**)

 That **babies** of **male** descent will be offered as **sacrifice**(Because the Night Queen can't have any babies). Which is what **Craster** does beyond the wall. The fact that Craster only **offers the sons** born out of **incest** with **his** own **daughters** is already a huge send-back to the **Targaryen** dynasty. From spitting fire to spitting ice, Daenerys will become the Ice Queen. With Jon being the one kissed by fire.  **A song of Ice and Fire**, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.. As for Bran, he is the Night King, but also the builder. Men could not have built that Wall alone. Jon has to rule in the North, be the ballance between Ice and Fire with Jon actually representing the fire. He is named after  [his real father](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Connington) . 



&gt; After being freed from the **Maidenvault**, **Elaena** **outlived her siblings** and led a tumultuous life. Although Elaena had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, The lord of the Tides. She gave birth to two bastard children by him, the twins Jon and Jeyne Waters.[2] Elaena had hoped to marry Alyn, , but he was lost at sea;*..* a year after his disappearance**, **she** gave up hope and **agreed to marry another.**
&gt; 

The [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men brought **the doom on the old Valyria**, which was said that was destroyed by **raining fire**. They turned the dragons against Valyria and the dragonlords. They can also easily take control of Danny's dragons.

A faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons.   It was also said that **Euron** might have paid **a faceless man** to **kill Balon Greyjoy** so he can become **king of the Iron Islands**. **Faceless men aren't cheap**. Euron he once had **a dragon egg** threw it in the sea, he claims... Euron gives his brother **Victarion** the **dragon horn** he has when he sends the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet to Meereen **to bring Daenerys** Targaryen back **to him**.

The God that **Melissandre** makes sacrifices to has the same [purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4). Don't forget where the faceless men started. . Bringing the **mercy of death** **to** people in **suffering** in the **fiery** **mines of Valyria**. **Whispering** a few encouraging words **in their ears**. In fact their saying is the same, **All men must die**(**slavers and masters too**). Where **Azor Ahai** was born..Where **wildfire** was discovered..

&gt; ""I Could.. but will I? (About freeing Ned) No. Questions would be asked and answers would  lead back to  me.. You have been foolish my lord. You should have heeded little finger,  when he asked you to sieze power.""(Varys to Ned)

**Varys**(who reminds me a lot of [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), the **auspicious** one, the **destroyer** ) is himself is a **faceless man**,  a mummer. Just like **Arya**, after being **sold by a Red priest**, was **found by a faceless man** and was thought how to become **no one**. That is why **Varys** can go by everywhere unnoticed. He used to be **a mummer** after all. Why he always **wears disguises** . He is the one suggesting that **Barristan Selmy** be removed from the King's Guard(another plot). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan to help Daenerys, is actually just **one of the spider's tricks** to get a father figure to inspire Danny to come home.

&gt; ""While **whispers** of a **certain eunuch's talents** **crossed the narrow sea** and **reached the ears of a certain king.**"" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)
&gt; 

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his grandfather and uncle died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, where his son, **Rhaegar was born**, **he became** **Aerys** Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then **he got  spiteful of the power of others**, especially that of his Hand of the King, **Tywin Lannister** (who had [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMtCEPNGaJw) been one of **his closest friend**s)

He is also the one telling Ned from the beginning how **the king is doomed** and he must help him. **Varys** releases Tyrion, who further kills ""his"" father, unknowingly, or perhaps on purpose fullfilling the wish of The Read Vyper(who had died for Tyrion, but also trying to bring Tywin to justice).

**Varys** always said he serves for **the good of the people**. Why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from **burning the Starks**?  ? Or help **Elaria's children**? There is no way he did not know about the **wild fire under the entire city** either. Clever **spider trap**.

&gt; ""Ah. **The children**. [It's **always** the innocents who suffer..""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJvhQ9-lsA) 
&gt; 
It was **your mercy** that killed The King"", (Varys to Ned in the dungeon)  

Remember the **Tragedy at Summerhall**? **Pyromancers** and **wildfire** causing an entire generation of **Targaryen**'s to **perish**, including one Lord Comman, known as **Ser Duncan the Tall**,  the **Lord Commander** of the Kingsguard.. The fire was said to have started when The King tried to **hatch the seven eggs** they had. They didn't succeed. **Rhaegar was born** though...


It was said that out of those **seven dragon eggs**, three **disappeared**. **Three eggs** were given as a **gift** for her **wedding** from Ilyrio Mopatis, the one who had sold her to **Khal Drogo**. You know Ilyrio! Varys's friend.  Varys was always such a good thief.

&gt; ""Trees did not grow on Braavos, save in the courts and gardens of the mighty.""(Sam)

T red priests have been manipulating Daenerys without her knowledge since the very beginning. She grew up in a house with a **red door.** She had a **lemon tree** in the garden in a city where nothing grew.  


**Ilyrio** **sold** **Daenerys** **to Khal Drogo** and gave her **three dragon eggs** as a **wedding gift** that would help bring the **doom upon Westeros** , just like Vayria of Old... Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called **The Tragedy at Summerhall**.

&gt; Rhaegar often liked to visit the **ruins of Summerhall** with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce [women](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne) to tears

**Ser Duncan** had fought and defeated **Ser Barristan Selmy** when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress** Ashara Dayne**, the girl every boy was in love with** , according to Selmy.  Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give the **masked warrior** a chance, just for a laugh. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. **A boy**, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how **Arstan** Whitebeard(anagram for R. Satan) got his nickname ""The bold""...Just like Littlefinger had lost the duel for the hand of Catelyn, Barristan would have to live with shame..   They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**... As Brandon did by the hand of The Mad King, with Littlefinger in his council..

&gt; George R.R. Martin has confirmed that one of the POV characters in A Dance with Dragons is gay and it is **implied** that this is **Jon**, who was in love with **Prince Rhaegar Targaryen**. Jon refers to Rhaegar as his ""**[silver prince](https://youtu.be/SCuXe2ZZAkU)**"" when he reminisces about him, and Jon believed Rhaegar's wife, **Elia Martell**, to have been **unworthy** of him.* 

Ser **Barristan The Bold**, just like **Brienne**, an honest knight,** loved his prince** and would have served him until the end, even going as far as taking his place[ on the battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn3_a7rC6E). 

&gt; 
&gt; ""Rhaegar's closest and oldest friend, however, was Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, trusting him more than Ser Barristan Selmy.""

It would be odd, though, given that Rhaegar's best friend was Arthur Dayne, that he would want to name him Jon. No. Jon was named after her father...



**Looking back**, Barristan was pretty **embarassed** at the **tourney**.  Just like **Littlefinger**, when he lost to **Brandon Stark**... Brandon Stark who would be **killed by fire** by the Mad King, with **Varys** in his **council**.
&gt; ""... And I admire you, Lord Baelish. A graper from a minor house, with a major talent for **befriending powerful men**. **And women**. ""(Varys)


Years later, at just **16**, at Harrenhal's tournament, where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, that [Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall, to impress **Ashara**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLUI6GxwNxk). just like **Brienne**, from the island of **saphires**, [defeatead  **Ser Loras Tyrel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU). But his love had eyes for someone else. For just like someone else we know,[Ashara was a ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYCfpeUUcw) **lady in waiting** for Ellaria Martel. And **Rhaegar's lover.**.
 **She kills herself after Robert's rebellion**, believing Rhaegar died.

&gt; *""**the blood of the dragon** **gathered** **in one** **seven eggs**, **to honour the seven gods**, though **the king's own septon had warned**: **pyromancers**, **wild fire** ... **flames grew out of control**, towering, burned so hot that  **died**, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...""* (Ser Duncan The Tall had managed, with the cost of his own life, to save a few people out of the fires. But where was Sir Barristan Selmy) 


We know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. Why would they do that? We know that Robert has fought against Barristan before and lost..

&gt; Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 


According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  

&gt; ""I told the court that Robert was hiding in the Stoney Sept, but the Hand of the King spent too much time searching the city. Something about the glory of single combat.""





&gt; 
&gt; at the Storms End tourney **Barristan** was able to unhorse **Lord Robert Baratheon**, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord **Jon Connington**, Lord Jason Mallister, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
 

 In fact we hear of even moreshameful defeat, on behalf of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Well, The Red Vyper, always with the wisdom. Because the mind behind the House of Garden is in fact [Mace Tyrell,](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface) and not his mother, the Queen of Thorns. 

Which is how he gave **Robert Baratheon** who was an unskilled fighter just like Renly,  the idea to use a warrior to fight  **Rhaegar**  in his stead. Rhaegar was as they said, not such a skilled fighter because he had started to train late, and he was never that interested.  **Barristan Selmy**, who loved his prince, decides to go fight in his stead, and defeats and kills Jon Connington. The same day, **Jon** is born. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several bastards during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight. According to a prophecy by Maggy the Frog, Robert has fathered sixteen children

In the place of Robert Baratheon you have Jon Connigton. The rubies in the ford that were scattered are more likely from the fiery hear adorned for the Lord of Light, the colours Stannis takes as well when he chooses that faith.



 [**Ashara**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne). After Robert's Rebellion, **believing** that her lover **Rhaegar** has **died**, **she kills herself**. 




Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw) on this world are almost the exact words he tells Ned when he is defeated at the battle of Ashford: ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" .. ""You'll rule.. you'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl... **Varys**, **Littlefinger**, **my brother**(all worshippers of R'hllor).. **No one to tell me no** but you.. **only you!**  



&gt; **""Let her live..."" ""Stop it if it's not to late"" ""My son  .. help him Ned. Make him better than me"".** ""My memory... King Robert Baratheon,**murdered by a pig**..""
&gt; 

So Ashara's lover couldn't have been Ned. Ashara killed herself for Rhaegar.. Too bad that Barristan Selmy loved her...

Other than that, other victims of Ser **Barristan** Sell me were [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight),  another **masked** knight who is , with his first original **brotherhood**, killed with the help of Arthur Dayne. His last words to Arthur Dayne were that he just wanted to take a **look** at his [Valyrian steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBhFLWopJa8)... Who knows, perhaps he knew where it came from.. [Arthur Dayne showed it to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkPxHxcP3Q)

&gt; "" **That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne**, but someplace along the way **he had become the [Smiling Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish)** instead.*"" (Jamie Lannister)


Other **Barristan Selmy victims**? Surprisingly, all **masked warriors**. Except for [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who most likely was used as **a pawn** to kidnap the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) .

We can see why House Martell will have their reasons  to betray the **Targaryens**, who were **in bed with Dorne**, just like they do with the [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bIQ4Hh8Bo\)). Who knows what secrets had the boy seen that the Red Vyper didn't want anyone to know.. Could it be Cersei again? Or Jamie too? [He did like it like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67dKcRTGvM)

&gt;  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.


As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men are very simmilar to R'hllor, whom Melissandre prays to. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves while the faceless men , the men serving the God of Death, respond[ Valar dohaeris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNFjDl4l3iE)

Haven't you ever wondered **why Gregor Clegane was fighting with skinny prisoners**  who could barely hold a sword? Probably because they were **offerings to the Red God**.. Look how casually **Cersei** walks up  to him there... as if she was used to these offerings... Is it a coincidence that the **Lannister** colours are a golden **lion on a crimson field**? Just like when **Stannis** drew his **Stag over a fiery heart...** 

&gt; ""*scattered* **the  rubies**  *encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water..*.""

-----------------------------------------
                                                     (Hot Shots!)  Part Deux...

&gt; ""**You're no Maester**.. Where's your chain?""(Jamie Lannister).... ""The Citadel **stripped me of it**. They found my experiments...**too bold**""   ""I can **take away the rotten flesh**.. and try and **burn out the corruption** ..  with any **luck** that will suffice(Qyburn)""
These **faceless men** was said to have appeared   and most likely **destroyed** the  **Old  Valyria**. **Whispering** encouraging words into  **slaves** ears(**All men must die**) who wanted a **swift death** instead of suffering in the **burning** pits. **From where only the Targaryens escaped**..

&gt; ""What's your name, **friend**?""... ""Qy**burn**.."" ""You're lucky to be **alive**..."" ""***Lucky***?"" 


 **The spider** who played with fire.**The** good **thief**. The one who most certainly knew about all the **secret passages** where the **Mad King** might have stored **wild fire.**.) And what **a trap** that was for the Tyrel's at **the Red Keep!** That was because The Red Keep had started **worshipping other Gods** The **wildfire** under the Red Keep  is **the light** which R'hllor uses to **destroy the Seven Gods worshippers**. All **trapped** in one place. All **offerings to the God of Fire and Death**. Qyburn is there to kill  Maester Pycelle as well..He revives the Mountain just as Thoros did. He was banned from the citadel for practicing magic.

&gt; ""It pains me, my lord..whatever your faults, you don't deserve to die alone, in such a cold, dark place..But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.."" Qyburn with Varys's [little mute devils](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silence) before killing the **old faithful Pycelle**. 

All the kids stabbed him with hatred. With revenge.. The kid who stabs Lancel Lannister looks like he feels remorse..for a Lannister. Stabs him once and runs away. But how did Qyburn just take over Varys's little whisperers? Who were said to be mute! How did he understand them?



Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....
Although **Daenerys** freed the people, she was still a **ruler** who would pride herself in her **old Valiryan blood**,and who would [cheat a merchant man of his price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpwtoHv8E6k), as if her cause excuses the deed. Her **Unsullied**, although forgotten, are quite the cruel warriors. In order to become Unsullied, they **must kill a baby**. Could this be an **offering to R'hllorl**? We also know that their **manhoods** are **cut off**. The same thing that happened to **Varys**.
&gt; ""The little scribe with the **big golden eyes** was **wise beyond her years.** She is **brave as well**. She had to be, to survive the life she's lived... **She relied so much on the little scribe** that she oft forgot that Missandei had only turned eleven.""(Daenerys, thinking about Missandei. 

[Missandei and Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9icZ9sfyvk) had been with **Daenerys** since she **took** over **the Unsullied** [by force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXpHvhjUzAI). 
&gt;  When Daenerys disappears on Drogon's back, **Hizdahr zo Loraq** attempts to **order** **the Unsullied** but **Grey Worm** and his men** refuse to obey him**. However when **Ser Barristan Selmy** goes to Grey Worm for his help in **seizing control** of Meereen, Grey Worm agrees to aid Selmy**. Grey Worm becomes a member of the ruling council of Meereen**. (A dance with Dragons)

**Three times** she will be betrayed. Third time is for **love**.... **Missandrei** had never taken off her slave ring from around her neck. Her clothes do look very simmilar to the actual **merchant** who wants to sell her **Daenerys** the **Unsullied she can't afford**..   **Like Mirri Maz Duur**, she **could not be freed by Daenerys** because did not need her freedom to begin with. [Look how they act in this scene with Varys](https://youtu.be/pJP9o6QMk-E), who has not been long there. ""So it's safe to say that a **fragile peace** has taken hold...""  ""***For now..***"" ""For now is the best we get in our profession""(nods at Missandei and [Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3w6c7RUbUs) and they both look at each other and then [straighten their backs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHJTYqLtRms&amp;t=31s) when Tyrion starts speaking..) Perhaps Grey Worm, as the leader of the Unsullied, was even spared his part...

&gt; ""**Grey Worm** gives this one **pride**. It is a **lucky** name. The name this one was born with was **cursed**. That was the name he had when he was taken as a **slave**. But **Grey Worm** is the name **this one** had **the day Daenerys** Stormborn **set him free**"" 

The **leader of the Unsullied** did not need her liberation. We don't know what his life might have been before, but we do know he knew Missandei, the little interpreter of the Good Masters of Astapor.
&gt; **The great goddess of the Unsullied** is called by many names, including the **Lady of Spears**, the Bride of Battle, and the **Mother of Hosts**. According to Grey Worm, her **true name** belongs only to the ones who have **burned their manhoods** upon her **altar**. The Unsullied **purify** themselves according to the laws of their great goddess; one way is to** bathe in the salt sea**. The Unsullied may not speak of the great goddess to others.


The one who truly loves Daenerys   from the [very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80KwlfqfRWk). Who did not tell her about the Varys plot, because he knew Varys was **caring for her.** We know that **Jorah** Mormont, **the bear**, who used to live in Essos, got exiled for selling slaves. right around Robert's Rebellion and he fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark.  The  only reason why **Jorah declines to take Longclaw** is because that is not his father's sword!  





&gt; What do we know about **Azor Ahai**? ([Makes me thing of the Lovecraftian demon Azathoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY-H3cwxmU)) Prohecised by the Red Prieststo** end** **the Long Night**. 

The Northerners say it was the Last Hero who joined the children of the Forestand won the battle for the Dorne against The Others(not the white walkers) to end it
.  
**The Descendants of the Rhoynar**say a **hero** convinced their gods to** bring back** the day with the [**secret song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swbGk7kw75U). 

**The YiTi** people say [a woman with a monkey's tail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SM3x2taiU) **restored the sun**

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die, and the white walkers to bring death, for all men must serve.. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart, or a heart of ice. 

&gt; White becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world. It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart.

The book covers are meaningful too.  **A feast** for **Crows** is in **fiery read**, with a cheremonial chalice, reminding of the one Melissandre would offer to drink from? You then have **A Game** of **thrones** where the **rulers** will be the **frozen** ones and what seems to be a **Valyrian** steel sword.. A **helmet**(like the **Mountains**), against a [green **field**(the **dothraki**). A shiny **golden crown** to go with some shiny **golden** Lannister  **hair** **or** perhaps those colours were of **sand** and not of gold.. and a **white shield** with one sole dragon, protecting the realm.  A **[horn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbinder)**, in **darkness**. What the Red Priests will bring once they control the darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Sansa will do something stupid that ultimately gets someone killed because she doesnt like Daenerys. Then I think Daenerys will find out and forgive her.

Jon will find out who he really is and struggle with it for a while but then find out Daenerys is pregnant and marry her at Winterfell and agree to rule alongside Daenerys, but he doesnt really want to rule.

Daenerys will also struggle with Jon's true heritage but not because of the incest because he has a better claim to the throne than her. Ultimately she'll ask Jon to rule with her when she finds out he has no interest in ruling the seven kingdoms.

Tyrion along with Sam and some other people will come up with a schematic for Dragon Armour. 

Daenerys and Jon's armies will fight the Night King and win but Daenerys will lose her other 2 dragons and most of the military force will be gone. Jon will ride Rhaegar into battle.

Jamie will die at the end of the battle after defeating the Night King himself. He will be mortally wounded and will die in Brienne's arms.

At the end of the white walker battler Jon will find Daenerys crying over a dying Drogon.

Sansa will then do another stupid thing that leads to her death or Arya becoming the Wardness of the north and Lady of Winterfell.

Jon and Daenerys will fight an uphill battle against Cersei who has the military advantage with the golden cloaks backing her. But eventually Jon and Daenerys will over come this with some tactical genius.

Jon and Daenerys will be outside Kings landing having all but won the war and Tyrion will go in to talk to Cersei. Tyrion will find out that Cersei has ordered kings landing to be burned to the ground fully making her the made Queen. Tyrion will then kill her. Kings landing will be utterly destroyed along with everyone inside (making Daenerys vision from a previous season where she walks to the Iron Throne in a destroyed throne room come true).

Is it ever explained why the wildlings were left on the other side of the wall? During the long night, way before the wall, they were all just first men in the north going through the same horrible long night and experienced ""the others"" attacks. They all had to know the purpose of the wall was to keep out the white walkers out should they return...so who in their right mind would want to be stuck on the front lines with the killer ice monsters?

It's not like the wall went up over night and it was some big surprise that landed them stuck on the $hitty side. Logic tells me the wildlings originally had the option/opportunity to live south of the wall if they wanted to, but chose to stay north. Could it be as simple as they didn't want to bend the knee way back then? Didn't the wall come before Winterfell? I know, I know, it's all legend and time is all screwed up, but is there anything in the books that elaborates on those original wildlings and why they stayed there?

Just a few other""want your opinion"" questions

The children and first men were at war for thousands of years. The first me were cutting down the tree's and stuff. They hated each other and then came the pact. Why do you think the first men chose to switch things up and start worshipping the old gods? What do you think convinced them the old gods were the real gods?

Winterfell was built after the long night so those of house Stark knew better than anybody about the others ability to raise the dead, so why in the world did they do the crypt thing instead burning their dead?

Lastly, (show question) ""if"" Crasters sons are turned into white walkers as baby's how do you think it works? Do they just immediately age as they are turning? Is it like the NK touches the baby and a few days later, he's a walking, dead horse riding, ice sword swinging grown ass white walker?",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

[One of the first visions The Night King Bran The Builder has.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY) is of the Mad King wanting to burn them all, and of the **Night King** **giving life** to a baby, then of **his father,** Ned,  **dying** by **the hand** of Ilyn Payne, **old Mad King**'s man... 

**The Night King** only **awoke** when the **Mad King** started **burn**ing **Starks**(*as a sacrifice to whom I wonder*).. 

&gt; ""When the **sun rises** in the **west** and **sets in the east**,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the **seas** **go dry** and **mountains blow** in the wind **like leaves**. When **your womb quickens again**, and you **bear** a **living child**.  **Then he will return**, and not before.""

The [rituals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwO4864ZFhc) the witch performed on **Khal Drogo** were offerings to the Red God, and paid for the life of Danny's **dragons**([He was a King after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R5L7cRkkQ)), but they are not her [**babies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACHEISPQohY).  **Viserys**, was **tricked by**  the people he had thought **his servants** into **selling  his sister** for a [ golden crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akl6OK2HUNA). He Died in the city *where it was forbidden to kill.* His death had paid for the death of Robert Baratheon. There is power in a king's blood.
&gt; 
&gt;  ""Beautiful **Beasts**"" (""[Not to me they aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNV4vywsgsY)"") 
 

**Beasts** used by the [red priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LvhZb3RgM), from the [faceless men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vwd_hrwYJg), who have used them against Valyria itself. This is why, as her beasts grow bigger, the magic of the warlocks and the red priests grows stronger as well(and faceless men too...) 

&gt; The **dragonlords of old Valyria** had controlled their mounts with **binding spells** and **sorcerous horns**. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip.




**In the beginning** it is said that the **men and the white walkers had peace**. A few things were demanded by the Night King back then.. among them was that a **Stark** will **marry a dead Queen** because.. **A Stark** Must always be **in the North** who **keeps** the **vengeful spirits in their crypts*** .
&gt; ""For thirteen years, **he** and **his Queen** ruled over **his brothers**, making **sacrifices** **as black as their cloaks**.""(**Ygritte**, **the free**)

 That **babies** of **male** descent will be offered as **sacrifice**(Because the Night Queen can't have any babies). Which is what **Craster** does beyond the wall. The fact that Craster only **offers the sons** born out of **incest** with **his** own **daughters** is already a huge send-back to the **Targaryen** dynasty. From spitting fire to spitting ice, Daenerys will become the Ice Queen. With Jon being the one kissed by fire.  **A song of Ice and Fire**, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.. As for Bran, he is the Night King, but also the builder. Men could not have built that Wall alone. Jon has to rule in the North, be the ballance between Ice and Fire with Jon actually representing the fire. He is named after  [his real father](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Connington) . 



&gt; After being freed from the **Maidenvault**, **Elaena** **outlived her siblings** and led a tumultuous life. Although Elaena had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, The lord of the Tides. She gave birth to two bastard children by him, the twins Jon and Jeyne Waters.[2] Elaena had hoped to marry Alyn, , but he was lost at sea;*..* a year after his disappearance**, **she** gave up hope and **agreed to marry another.**
&gt; 

The [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men brought **the doom on the old Valyria**, which was said that was destroyed by **raining fire**. They turned the dragons against Valyria and the dragonlords. They can also easily take control of Danny's dragons.

A faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons.   It was also said that **Euron** might have paid **a faceless man** to **kill Balon Greyjoy** so he can become **king of the Iron Islands**. **Faceless men aren't cheap**. Euron he once had **a dragon egg** threw it in the sea, he claims... Euron gives his brother **Victarion** the **dragon horn** he has when he sends the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet to Meereen **to bring Daenerys** Targaryen back **to him**.

The God that **Melissandre** makes sacrifices to has the same [purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4). Don't forget where the faceless men started. . Bringing the **mercy of death** **to** people in **suffering** in the **fiery** **mines of Valyria**. **Whispering** a few encouraging words **in their ears**. In fact their saying is the same, **All men must die**(**slavers and masters too**). Where **Azor Ahai** was born..Where **wildfire** was discovered..

&gt; ""I Could.. but will I? (About freeing Ned) No. Questions would be asked and answers would  lead back to  me.. You have been foolish my lord. You should have heeded little finger,  when he asked you to sieze power.""(Varys to Ned)

**Varys**(who reminds me a lot of [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), the **auspicious** one, the **destroyer** ) is himself is a **faceless man**,  a mummer. Just like **Arya**, after being **sold by a Red priest**, was **found by a faceless man** and was thought how to become **no one**. That is why **Varys** can go by everywhere unnoticed. He used to be **a mummer** after all. Why he always **wears disguises** . He is the one suggesting that **Barristan Selmy** be removed from the King's Guard(another plot). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan to help Daenerys, is actually just **one of the spider's tricks** to get a father figure to inspire Danny to come home.

&gt; ""While **whispers** of a **certain eunuch's talents** **crossed the narrow sea** and **reached the ears of a certain king.**"" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)
&gt; 

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his grandfather and uncle died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, where his son, **Rhaegar was born**, **he became** **Aerys** Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then **he got  spiteful of the power of others**, especially that of his Hand of the King, **Tywin Lannister** (who had [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMtCEPNGaJw) been one of **his closest friend**s)

He is also the one telling Ned from the beginning how **the king is doomed** and he must help him. **Varys** releases Tyrion, who further kills ""his"" father, unknowingly, or perhaps on purpose fullfilling the wish of The Read Vyper(who had died for Tyrion, but also trying to bring Tywin to justice).

**Varys** always said he serves for **the good of the people**. Why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from **burning the Starks**?  ? Or help **Elaria's children**? There is no way he did not know about the **wild fire under the entire city** either. Clever **spider trap**.

&gt; ""Ah. **The children**. [It's **always** the innocents who suffer..""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJvhQ9-lsA) 
&gt; 
It was **your mercy** that killed The King"", (Varys to Ned in the dungeon)  

Remember the **Tragedy at Summerhall**? **Pyromancers** and **wildfire** causing an entire generation of **Targaryen**'s to **perish**, including one Lord Comman, known as **Ser Duncan the Tall**,  the **Lord Commander** of the Kingsguard.. The fire was said to have started when The King tried to **hatch the seven eggs** they had. They didn't succeed. **Rhaegar was born** though...


It was said that out of those **seven dragon eggs**, three **disappeared**. **Three eggs** were given as a **gift** for her **wedding** from Ilyrio Mopatis, the one who had sold her to **Khal Drogo**. You know Ilyrio! Varys's friend.  Varys was always such a good thief.

&gt; ""Trees did not grow on Braavos, save in the courts and gardens of the mighty.""(Sam)

T red priests have been manipulating Daenerys without her knowledge since the very beginning. She grew up in a house with a **red door.** She had a **lemon tree** in the garden in a city where nothing grew.  


**Ilyrio** **sold** **Daenerys** **to Khal Drogo** and gave her **three dragon eggs** as a **wedding gift** that would help bring the **doom upon Westeros** , just like Vayria of Old... Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called **The Tragedy at Summerhall**.

&gt; Rhaegar often liked to visit the **ruins of Summerhall** with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce [women](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne) to tears

**Ser Duncan** had fought and defeated **Ser Barristan Selmy** when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress** Ashara Dayne**, the girl every boy was in love with** , according to Selmy.  Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give the **masked warrior** a chance, just for a laugh. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. **A boy**, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how **Arstan** Whitebeard(anagram for R. Satan) got his nickname ""The bold""...Just like Littlefinger had lost the duel for the hand of Catelyn, Barristan would have to live with shame..   They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**... As Brandon did by the hand of The Mad King, with Littlefinger in his council..

&gt; George R.R. Martin has confirmed that one of the POV characters in A Dance with Dragons is gay and it is **implied** that this is **Jon**, who was in love with **Prince Rhaegar Targaryen**. Jon refers to Rhaegar as his ""**[silver prince](https://youtu.be/SCuXe2ZZAkU)**"" when he reminisces about him, and Jon believed Rhaegar's wife, **Elia Martell**, to have been **unworthy** of him.* 

Ser **Barristan The Bold**, just like **Brienne**, an honest knight,** loved his prince** and would have served him until the end, even going as far as taking his place[ on the battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn3_a7rC6E). 

&gt; 
&gt; ""Rhaegar's closest and oldest friend, however, was Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, trusting him more than Ser Barristan Selmy.""

It would be odd, though, given that Rhaegar's best friend was Arthur Dayne, that he would want to name him Jon. No. Jon was named after her father...



**Looking back**, Barristan was pretty **embarassed** at the **tourney**.  Just like **Littlefinger**, when he lost to **Brandon Stark**... Brandon Stark who would be **killed by fire** by the Mad King, with **Varys** in his **council**.
&gt; ""... And I admire you, Lord Baelish. A graper from a minor house, with a major talent for **befriending powerful men**. **And women**. ""(Varys)


Years later, at just **16**, at Harrenhal's tournament, where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, that [Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall, to impress **Ashara**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLUI6GxwNxk). just like **Brienne**, from the island of **saphires**, [defeatead  **Ser Loras Tyrel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU). But his love had eyes for someone else. For just like someone else we know,[Ashara was a ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYCfpeUUcw) **lady in waiting** for Ellaria Martel. And **Rhaegar's lover.**.
 **She kills herself after Robert's rebellion**, believing Rhaegar died.

&gt; *""**the blood of the dragon** **gathered** **in one** **seven eggs**, **to honour the seven gods**, though **the king's own septon had warned**: **pyromancers**, **wild fire** ... **flames grew out of control**, towering, burned so hot that  **died**, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...""* (Ser Duncan The Tall had managed, with the cost of his own life, to save a few people out of the fires. But where was Sir Barristan Selmy) 


We know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. Why would they do that? We know that Robert has fought against Barristan before and lost..

&gt; Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 


According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  

&gt; ""I told the court that Robert was hiding in the Stoney Sept, but the Hand of the King spent too much time searching the city. Something about the glory of single combat.""





&gt; 
&gt; at the Storms End tourney **Barristan** was able to unhorse **Lord Robert Baratheon**, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord **Jon Connington**, Lord Jason Mallister, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
 

 In fact we hear of even moreshameful defeat, on behalf of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Well, The Red Vyper, always with the wisdom. Because the mind behind the House of Garden is in fact [Mace Tyrell,](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface) and not his mother, the Queen of Thorns. 

Which is how he gave **Robert Baratheon** who was an unskilled fighter just like Renly,  the idea to use a warrior to fight  **Rhaegar**  in his stead. Rhaegar was as they said, not such a skilled fighter because he had started to train late, and he was never that interested.  **Barristan Selmy**, who loved his prince, decides to go fight in his stead, and defeats and kills Jon Connington. The same day, **Jon** is born. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several bastards during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight. According to a prophecy by Maggy the Frog, Robert has fathered sixteen children

In the place of Robert Baratheon you have Jon Connigton. The rubies in the ford that were scattered are more likely from the fiery hear adorned for the Lord of Light, the colours Stannis takes as well when he chooses that faith.



 [**Ashara**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne). After Robert's Rebellion, **believing** that her lover **Rhaegar** has **died**, **she kills herself**. 




Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw) on this world are almost the exact words he tells Ned when he is defeated at the battle of Ashford: ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" .. ""You'll rule.. you'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl... **Varys**, **Littlefinger**, **my brother**(all worshippers of R'hllor).. **No one to tell me no** but you.. **only you!**  



&gt; **""Let her live..."" ""Stop it if it's not to late"" ""My son  .. help him Ned. Make him better than me"".** ""My memory... King Robert Baratheon,**murdered by a pig**..""
&gt; 

So Ashara's lover couldn't have been Ned. Ashara killed herself for Rhaegar.. Too bad that Barristan Selmy loved her...

Other than that, other victims of Ser **Barristan** Sell me were [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight),  another **masked** knight who is , with his first original **brotherhood**, killed with the help of Arthur Dayne. His last words to Arthur Dayne were that he just wanted to take a **look** at his [Valyrian steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBhFLWopJa8)... Who knows, perhaps he knew where it came from.. [Arthur Dayne showed it to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkPxHxcP3Q) 
&gt; 
&gt; "" **That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne**, but someplace along the way **he had become the [Smiling Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish)** instead.*"" (Jamie Lannister)


Other **Barristan Selmy victims**? Surprisingly, all **masked warriors**. Except for [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who most likely was used as **a pawn** to kidnap the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) . He was said to have also killed ***Maelys I Blackfyre*** , the last of the **Blackfyre pretender**s, called Monstrous for supposedly having **eaten his twin in the womb**,  making him a  **kinslayer**.


&gt;  ""**Aegon the Unworthy** legitimized all his **bastard**s on his deathbed. Inevitably the greatest of these, [Daemon Blackfyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuDu43Gnyts), declared himself the rightful heir, and ignited yet another war for the crown.""

&gt; 


We can see why House Martell will have their reasons  to betray the **Targaryens**, who were **in bed with Dorne**, just like they do with the [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bIQ4Hh8Bo\)). Who knows what secrets had the boy seen that the Red Vyper didn't want anyone to know.. Could it be Cersei again? Or Jamie too? [He did like it like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67dKcRTGvM)

&gt;  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.


As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men are very simmilar to R'hllor, whom Melissandre prays to. Fire brings death after all, and darkness.

Haven't you ever wondered **why Gregor Clegane was fighting with skinny prisoners**  who could barely hold a sword? Probably because they were **offerings to the Red God**.. Look how casually **Cersei** walks up  to him there... as if she was used to these offerings... Is it a coincidence that the **Lannister** colours are a golden **lion on a crimson field**?

Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....
Although **Daenerys** freed the people, she was still a **ruler** who would pride herself in her **old Valiryan blood**,and who would [cheat a merchant man of his price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpwtoHv8E6k), as if her cause excuses the deed. Her **Unsullied**, although forgotten, are quite the cruel warriors. In order to become Unsullied, they **must kill a baby**. Could this be an **offering to R'hllorl**?

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die, and the white walkers to bring death, for all men must serve.. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart, or a heart of ice. 

&gt; White becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world. It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart.

The book covers are meaningful too.  **A feast** for **Crows** is in **fiery read**, with a cheremonial chalice, reminding of the one Melissandre would offer to drink from? You then have **A Game** of **thrones** where the **rulers** will be the **frozen** ones and what seems to be a **Valyrian** steel sword.. A **helmet**(like the **Mountains**), against a [green **field**(the **dothraki**). A shiny **golden crown** to go with some shiny **golden** Lannister  **hair** **or** perhaps those colours were of **sand** and not of gold.. and a **white shield** with one sole dragon, protecting the realm.  A **[horn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbinder)**, in **darkness**. What the Red Priests will bring once they control the darkness.

&gt; One green and three black candles were brought to the Citadel from Valyria a thousand years before the Doom of Valyria.(white becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world). It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart.

It corrupts those who think they master it, and their Gods always demand that their [worshippers give their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IccqnH7VJjk) to them and be **born again**.

&gt; The king  **the old king**, **Aerys II** Targaryen, who **had not been quite so mad in those days**, had sent his lordship **to seek a bride** **for Prince Rhaegar**, who had no sisters to wed(yet).. **We have bought his freedom** and hope to bring him home with us. **Robert will be delighted with him**, and perhaps in time he will even teach **Stannis how to laugh** (Maester Cressen regrets that Patchface  never did teach Stannis to laugh)

In his youth, Patchface was a clever boy with astonishing wit; after his accident, however, his **mind and body** are **broken**. After his **survival** from the **shipwreck** he is described as soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles and has a [weird sideways walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRR59EK9zz0). 
The ship that was supposed to bring back Rhaegar's bride was probably sunk by a sea monster controlled by the same person who took Patchface's wits.

[One of the first visions The Night King Bran The Builder has.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY) is of the Mad King wanting to burn them all, and of the **Night King** **giving life** to a baby, then of **his father,** Ned,  **dying** by **the hand** of Ilyn Payne, **old Mad King**'s man...

**Beasts** used by the [red priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LvhZb3RgM), from the [faceless men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vwd_hrwYJg), who have used them against Valyria itself. This is why, as her beasts grow bigger, the magic of the warlocks and the red priests grows stronger as well(and faceless men too...) 

&gt; The **dragonlords of old Valyria** had controlled their mounts with **binding spells** and **sorcerous horns**. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip.




**In the beginning** it is said that the **men and the white walkers had peace**. A few things were demanded by the Night King back then.. among them was that a **Stark** will **marry a dead Queen** because.. **A Stark** Must always be **in the North** who **keeps** the **vengeful spirits in their crypts*** .
&gt; ""For thirteen years, **he** and **his Queen** ruled over **his brothers**, making **sacrifices** **as black as their cloaks**.""(**Ygritte**, **the free**)

 That **babies** of **male** descent will be offered as **sacrifice**(Because the Night Queen can't have any babies). Which is what **Craster** does beyond the wall. The fact that Craster only **offers the sons** born out of **incest** with **his** own **daughters** is already a huge send-back to the **Targaryen** dynasty. From spitting fire to spitting ice, Daenerys will become the Ice Queen. With Jon being the one kissed by fire.  **A song of Ice and Fire**, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.. As for Bran, he is the Night King, but also the builder. Men could not have built that Wall alone. Jon has to rule in the North, be the ballance between Ice and Fire with Jon actually representing the fire. He is named after  [his real father](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Connington) . 



&gt; After being freed from the **Maidenvault**, **Elaena** **outlived her siblings** and led a tumultuous life. Although Elaena had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, The lord of the Tides. She gave birth to two bastard children by him, the twins Jon and Jeyne Waters.[2] Elaena had hoped to marry Alyn, , but he was lost at sea;*..* a year after his disappearance**, **she** gave up hope and **agreed to marry another.**
&gt; 

The [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men brought **the doom on the old Valyria**, which was said that was destroyed by **raining fire**. They turned the dragons against Valyria and the dragonlords. They can also easily take control of Danny's dragons.

A faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons.   It was also said that **Euron** might have paid **a faceless man** to **kill Balon Greyjoy** so he can become **king of the Iron Islands**. **Faceless men aren't cheap**. Euron he once had **a dragon egg** threw it in the sea, he claims... Euron gives his brother **Victarion** the **dragon horn** he has when he sends the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet to Meereen **to bring Daenerys** Targaryen back **to him**.

The God that **Melissandre** makes sacrifices to has the same [purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4). Don't forget where the faceless men started. . Bringing the **mercy of death** **to** people in **suffering** in the **fiery** **mines of Valyria**. **Whispering** a few encouraging words **in their ears**. In fact their saying is the same, **All men must die**(**slavers and masters too**). Where **Azor Ahai** was born..Where **wildfire** was discovered..

&gt; ""I Could.. but will I? (About freeing Ned) No. Questions would be asked and answers would  lead back to  me.. You have been foolish my lord. You should have heeded little finger,  when he asked you to sieze power.""(Varys to Ned)

**Varys**(who reminds me a lot of [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), the **auspicious** one, the **destroyer** ) is himself is a **faceless man**,  a mummer. Just like **Arya**, after being **sold by a Red priest**, was **found by a faceless man** and was thought how to become **no one**. That is why **Varys** can go by everywhere unnoticed. He used to be **a mummer** after all. Why he always **wears disguises** . He is the one suggesting that **Barristan Selmy** be removed from the King's Guard(another plot). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan to help Daenerys, is actually just **one of the spider's tricks** to get a father figure to inspire Danny to come home.

&gt; ""While **whispers** of a **certain eunuch's talents** **crossed the narrow sea** and **reached the ears of a certain king.**"" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)
&gt; 

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his grandfather and uncle died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, where his son, **Rhaegar was born**, **he became** **Aerys** Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then **he got  spiteful of the power of others**, especially that of his Hand of the King, **Tywin Lannister** (who had [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMtCEPNGaJw) been one of **his closest friend**s)

He is also the one telling Ned from the beginning how **the king is doomed** and he must help him. **Varys** releases Tyrion, who further kills ""his"" father, unknowingly, or perhaps on purpose fullfilling the wish of The Read Vyper(who had died for Tyrion, but also trying to bring Tywin to justice).

**Varys** always said he serves for **the good of the people**. Why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from **burning the Starks**?  ? Or help **Elaria's children**? There is no way he did not know about the **wild fire under the entire city** either. Clever **spider trap**.

&gt; ""Ah. **The children**. [It's **always** the innocents who suffer..""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJvhQ9-lsA) 
&gt; 
It was **your mercy** that killed The King"", (Varys to Ned in the dungeon)  

Remember the **Tragedy at Summerhall**? **Pyromancers** and **wildfire** causing an entire generation of **Targaryen**'s to **perish**, including one Lord Comman, known as **Ser Duncan the Tall**,  the **Lord Commander** of the Kingsguard.. The fire was said to have started when The King tried to **hatch the seven eggs** they had. They didn't succeed. **Rhaegar was born** though...


It was said that out of those **seven dragon eggs**, three **disappeared**. **Three eggs** were given as a **gift** for her **wedding** from Ilyrio Mopatis, the one who had sold her to **Khal Drogo**. You know Ilyrio! Varys's friend.  Varys was always such a good thief.

&gt; ""Trees did not grow on Braavos, save in the courts and gardens of the mighty.""(Sam)

T red priests have been manipulating Daenerys without her knowledge since the very beginning. She grew up in a house with a **red door.** She had a **lemon tree** in the garden in a city where nothing grew.  


**Ilyrio** **sold** **Daenerys** **to Khal Drogo** and gave her **three dragon eggs** as a **wedding gift** that would help bring the **doom upon Westeros** , just like Vayria of Old... Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called **The Tragedy at Summerhall**.

&gt; Rhaegar often liked to visit the **ruins of Summerhall** with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce [women](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne) to tears

**Ser Duncan** had fought and defeated **Ser Barristan Selmy** when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress** Ashara Dayne**, the girl every boy was in love with** , according to Selmy.  Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give the **masked warrior** a chance, just for a laugh. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. **A boy**, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how **Arstan** Whitebeard(anagram for R. Satan) got his nickname ""The bold""...Just like Littlefinger had lost the duel for the hand of Catelyn, Barristan would have to live with shame..   They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**... As Brandon did by the hand of The Mad King, with Littlefinger in his council..

&gt; George R.R. Martin has confirmed that one of the POV characters in A Dance with Dragons is gay and it is **implied** that this is **Jon**, who was in love with **Prince Rhaegar Targaryen**. Jon refers to Rhaegar as his ""**[silver prince](https://youtu.be/SCuXe2ZZAkU)**"" when he reminisces about him, and Jon believed Rhaegar's wife, **Elia Martell**, to have been **unworthy** of him.* 

Ser **Barristan The Bold**, just like **Brienne**, an honest knight,** loved his prince** and would have served him until the end, even going as far as taking his place[ on the battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn3_a7rC6E). 

&gt; 
&gt; ""Rhaegar's closest and oldest friend, however, was Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, trusting him more than Ser Barristan Selmy.""

It would be odd, though, given that Rhaegar's best friend was Arthur Dayne, that he would want to name him Jon. No. Jon was named after her father...



**Looking back**, Barristan was pretty **embarassed** at the **tourney**.  Just like **Littlefinger**, when he lost to **Brandon Stark**... Brandon Stark who would be **killed by fire** by the Mad King, with **Varys** in his **council**.
&gt; ""... And I admire you, Lord Baelish. A graper from a minor house, with a major talent for **befriending powerful men**. **And women**. ""(Varys)


Years later, at just **16**, at Harrenhal's tournament, where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, that [Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall, to impress **Ashara**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLUI6GxwNxk). just like **Brienne**, from the island of **saphires**, [defeatead  **Ser Loras Tyrel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU). But his love had eyes for someone else. For just like someone else we know,[Ashara was a ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYCfpeUUcw) **lady in waiting** for Ellaria Martel. And **Rhaegar's lover.**.
 **She kills herself after Robert's rebellion**, believing Rhaegar died.

&gt; *""**the blood of the dragon** **gathered** **in one** **seven eggs**, **to honour the seven gods**, though **the king's own septon had warned**: **pyromancers**, **wild fire** ... **flames grew out of control**, towering, burned so hot that  **died**, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...""* (Ser Duncan The Tall had managed, with the cost of his own life, to save a few people out of the fires. But where was Sir Barristan Selmy) 


We know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. Why would they do that? We know that Robert has fought against Barristan before and lost..

&gt; Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 


According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  

&gt; ""I told the court that Robert was hiding in the Stoney Sept, but the Hand of the King spent too much time searching the city. Something about the glory of single combat.""





&gt; 
&gt; at the Storms End tourney **Barristan** was able to unhorse **Lord Robert Baratheon**, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord **Jon Connington**, Lord Jason Mallister, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
 

 In fact we hear of even moreshameful defeat, on behalf of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Well, The Red Vyper, always with the wisdom. Because the mind behind the House of Garden is in fact [Mace Tyrell,](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface) and not his mother, the Queen of Thorns. 

Which is how he gave **Robert Baratheon** who was an unskilled fighter just like Renly,  the idea to use a warrior to fight  **Rhaegar**  in his stead. Rhaegar was as they said, not such a skilled fighter because he had started to train late, and he was never that interested.  **Barristan Selmy**, who loved his prince, decides to go fight in his stead, and defeats and kills Jon Connington. The same day, **Jon** is born. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several bastards during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight. According to a prophecy by Maggy the Frog, Robert has fathered sixteen children

In the place of Robert Baratheon you have Jon Connigton. The rubies in the ford that were scattered are more likely from the fiery hear adorned for the Lord of Light, the colours Stannis takes as well when he chooses that faith.



 [**Ashara**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne). After Robert's Rebellion, **believing** that her lover **Rhaegar** has **died**, **she kills herself**. 




Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw) on this world are almost the exact words he tells Ned when he is defeated at the battle of Ashford: ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" .. ""You'll rule.. you'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl... **Varys**, **Littlefinger**, **my brother**(all worshippers of R'hllor).. **No one to tell me no** but you.. **only you!**  



&gt; **""Let her live..."" ""Stop it if it's not to late"" ""My son  .. help him Ned. Make him better than me"".** ""My memory... King Robert Baratheon,**murdered by a pig**..""
&gt; 

So Ashara's lover couldn't have been Ned. Ashara killed herself for Rhaegar.. Too bad that Barristan Selmy loved her...

Other than that, other victims of Ser **Barristan** Sell me were [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight),  another **masked** knight who is , with his first original **brotherhood**, killed with the help of Arthur Dayne. His last words to Arthur Dayne were that he just wanted to take a **look** at his [Valyrian steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBhFLWopJa8)... Who knows, perhaps he knew where it came from.. [Arthur Dayne showed it to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkPxHxcP3Q) 
&gt; 
&gt; "" **That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne**, but someplace along the way **he had become the [Smiling Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish)** instead.*"" (Jamie Lannister)


Other **Barristan Selmy victims**? Surprisingly, all **masked warriors**. Except for [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who most likely was used as **a pawn** to kidnap the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) . He was said to have also killed ***Maelys I Blackfyre*** , the last of the **Blackfyre pretender**s, called Monstrous for supposedly having **eaten his twin in the womb**,  making him a  **kinslayer**.


&gt;  ""**Aegon the Unworthy** legitimized all his **bastard**s on his deathbed. Inevitably the greatest of these, [Daemon Blackfyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuDu43Gnyts), declared himself the rightful heir, and ignited yet another war for the crown.""

We can see why House Martell will have their reasons  to betray the **Targaryens**, who were **in bed with Dorne**, just like they do with the [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bIQ4Hh8Bo\)). Who knows what secrets had the boy seen that the Red Vyper didn't want anyone to know.. Could it be Cersei again? Or Jamie too? [He did like it like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67dKcRTGvM)

&gt;  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.


As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men are very simmilar to R'hllor, whom Melissandre prays to. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves while the faceless men , the men serving the God of Death, respond[ Valar dohaeris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNFjDl4l3iE)

Haven't you ever wondered **why Gregor Clegane was fighting with skinny prisoners**  who could barely hold a sword? Probably because they were **offerings to the Red God**.. Look how casually **Cersei** walks up  to him there... as if she was used to these offerings... Is it a coincidence that the **Lannister** colours are a golden **lion on a crimson field**? Just like when **Stannis** drew his **Stag over a fiery heart...**

 **The spider** who played with fire.**The** good **thief**. The one who most certainly knew about all the **secret passages** where the **Mad King** might have stored **wild fire.**.) And what **a trap** that was for the Tyrel's at **the Red Keep!** That was because The Red Keep had started **worshipping other Gods** The **wildfire** under the Red Keep  is **the light** which R'hllor uses to **destroy the Seven Gods worshippers**. All **trapped** in one place. All **offerings to the God of Fire and Death**. Qyburn is there to kill  Maester Pycelle as well..He revives the Mountain just as Thoros did. He was banned from the citadel for practicing magic.

Qyburn with Varys's [little mute devils](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silence) before killing the **old faithful Pycelle**. 

All the kids stabbed him with hatred. With revenge.. The kid who stabs Lancel Lannister looks like he feels remorse..for a Lannister. Stabs him once and runs away. But how did Qyburn just take over Varys's little whisperers? Who were said to be mute! How did he understand them?



Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....
Although **Daenerys** freed the people, she was still a **ruler** who would pride herself in her **old Valiryan blood**,and who would [cheat a merchant man of his price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpwtoHv8E6k), as if her cause excuses the deed. Her **Unsullied**, although forgotten, are quite the cruel warriors. In order to become Unsullied, they **must kill a baby**. Could this be an **offering to R'hllorl**? We also know that their **manhoods** are **cut off**. The same thing that happened to **Varys**.
&gt; ""The little scribe with the **big golden eyes** was **wise beyond her years.** She is **brave as well**. She had to be, to survive the life she's lived... **She relied so much on the little scribe** that she oft forgot that Missandei had only turned eleven.""(Daenerys, thinking about Missandei. 

[Missandei and Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9icZ9sfyvk) had been with **Daenerys** since she **took** over **the Unsullied** [by force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXpHvhjUzAI). 
&gt;  When Daenerys disappears on Drogon's back, **Hizdahr zo Loraq** attempts to **order** **the Unsullied** but **Grey Worm** and his men** refuse to obey him**. However when **Ser Barristan Selmy** goes to Grey Worm for his help in **seizing control** of Meereen, Grey Worm agrees to aid Selmy**. Grey Worm becomes a member of the ruling council of Meereen**. (A dance with Dragons)

**Three times** she will be betrayed. Third time is for **love**.... **Missandrei** had never taken off her slave ring from around her neck. Her clothes do look very simmilar to the actual **merchant** who wants to sell her **Daenerys** the **Unsullied she can't afford**..   **Like Mirri Maz Duur**, she **could not be freed by Daenerys** because did not need her freedom to begin with. [Look how they act in this scene with Varys](https://youtu.be/pJP9o6QMk-E), who has not been long there. ""So it's safe to say that a **fragile peace** has taken hold...""  ""***For now..***"" ""For now is the best we get in our profession""(nods at Missandei and [Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3w6c7RUbUs) and they both look at each other and then [straighten their backs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHJTYqLtRms&amp;t=31s) when Tyrion starts speaking..) Perhaps Grey Worm, as the leader of the Unsullied, was even spared his part...

&gt; ""**Grey Worm** gives this one **pride**. It is a **lucky** name. The name this one was born with was **cursed**. That was the name he had when he was taken as a **slave**. But **Grey Worm** is the name **this one** had **the day Daenerys** Stormborn **set him free**"" 

The **leader of the Unsullied** did not need her liberation. We don't know what his life might have been before, but we do know he knew Missandei, the little interpreter of the Good Masters of Astapor.
&gt; **The great goddess of the Unsullied** is called by many names, including the **Lady of Spears**, the Bride of Battle, and the **Mother of Hosts**. According to Grey Worm, her **true name** belongs only to the ones who have **burned their manhoods** upon her **altar**. The Unsullied **purify** themselves according to the laws of their great goddess; one way is to** bathe in the salt sea**. The Unsullied may not speak of the great goddess to others.


The one who truly loves Daenerys   from the [very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80KwlfqfRWk). Who did not tell her about the Varys plot, because he knew Varys was **caring for her.** We know that **Jorah** Mormont, **the bear**, who used to live in Essos, got exiled for selling slaves. right around Robert's Rebellion and he fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark.  The  only reason why **Jorah declines to take Longclaw** is because that is not his father's sword!  





&gt; What do we know about **Azor Ahai**? ([Makes me thing of the Lovecraftian demon Azathoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY-H3cwxmU)) Prohecised by the Red Prieststo** end** **the Long Night**.

**The YiTi** people say [a woman with a monkey's tail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SM3x2taiU) **restored the sun**

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die, and the white walkers to bring death, for all men must serve.. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart, or a heart of ice. 

&gt; White becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world. It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart.

The book covers are meaningful too.  **A feast** for **Crows** is in **fiery read**, with a cheremonial chalice, reminding of the one Melissandre would offer to drink from? You then have **A Game** of **thrones** where the **rulers** will be the **frozen** ones and what seems to be a **Valyrian** steel sword.. A **helmet**(like the **Mountains**), against a [green **field**(the **dothraki**). A shiny **golden crown** to go with some shiny **golden** Lannister  **hair** **or** perhaps those colours were of **sand** and not of gold.. and a **white shield** with one sole dragon, protecting the realm.  A **[horn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbinder)**, in **darkness**. What the Red Priests will bring once they control the darkness.

The ship that was supposed to bring back Rhaegar's bride was probably sunk by a sea monster controlled by the same person who took Patchface's wits.
&gt; 
&gt;  **That creature is dangerous.** Many a time I have glimpsed him in my flames. Sometimes there are s**kulls about him**, and his **lips are red with blood**. - Melisandre to Jon Snow(about Patchface or Hodor?)

[Only light](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Glass_candle) can fight darkness.   ([not even stone(people) can stand fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEWHmK2X0A)).

[One of the first visions The Night King Bran The Builder has.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY) is of the Mad King wanting to burn them all, and of the **Night King** **giving life** to a baby, then of **his father,** Ned,  **dying** by **the hand** of Ilyn Payne, **old Mad King**'s man... 

**The Night King** only **awoke** when the **Mad King** started **burn**ing **Starks**(*as a sacrifice to whom I wonder*).. 

&gt; ""When the **sun rises** in the **west** and **sets in the east**,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the **seas** **go dry** and **mountains blow** in the wind **like leaves**. When **your womb quickens again**, and you **bear** a **living child**.  **Then he will return**, and not before.""

The [rituals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwO4864ZFhc) the witch performed on **Khal Drogo** were offerings to the Red God, and paid for the life of Danny's **dragons**([He was a King after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R5L7cRkkQ)), but they are not her [**babies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACHEISPQohY).  **Viserys**, was **tricked by**  the people he had thought **his servants** into **selling  his sister** for a [ golden crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akl6OK2HUNA). He Died in the city *where it was forbidden to kill.* His death had paid for the death of Robert Baratheon. There is power in a king's blood.
&gt; 
&gt;  ""Beautiful **Beasts**"" (""[Not to me they aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNV4vywsgsY)"") 
 

**Beasts** used by the [red priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LvhZb3RgM), from the [faceless men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vwd_hrwYJg), who have used them against Valyria itself. This is why, as her beasts grow bigger, the magic of the warlocks and the red priests grows stronger as well(and faceless men too...) 

&gt; The **dragonlords of old Valyria** had controlled their mounts with **binding spells** and **sorcerous horns**. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip.




**In the beginning** it is said that the **men and the white walkers had peace**. A few things were demanded by the Night King back then.. among them was that a **Stark** will **marry a dead Queen** because.. **A Stark** Must always be **in the North** who **keeps** the **vengeful spirits in their crypts*** .
&gt; ""For thirteen years, **he** and **his Queen** ruled over **his brothers**, making **sacrifices** **as black as their cloaks**.""(**Ygritte**, **the free**)

 That **babies** of **male** descent will be offered as **sacrifice**(Because the Night Queen can't have any babies). Which is what **Craster** does beyond the wall. The fact that Craster only **offers the sons** born out of **incest** with **his** own **daughters** is already a huge send-back to the **Targaryen** dynasty. From spitting fire to spitting ice, Daenerys will become the Ice Queen. With Jon being the one kissed by fire.  **A song of Ice and Fire**, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.. As for Bran, he is the Night King, but also the builder. Men could not have built that Wall alone. Jon has to rule in the North, be the ballance between Ice and Fire with Jon actually representing the fire. He is named after  [his real father](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Connington) . 



&gt; After being freed from the **Maidenvault**, **Elaena** **outlived her siblings** and led a tumultuous life. Although Elaena had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, The lord of the Tides. She gave birth to two bastard children by him, the twins Jon and Jeyne Waters.[2] Elaena had hoped to marry Alyn, , but he was lost at sea;*..* a year after his disappearance**, **she** gave up hope and **agreed to marry another.**
&gt; 

The [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men brought **the doom on the old Valyria**, which was said that was destroyed by **raining fire**. They turned the dragons against Valyria and the dragonlords. They can also easily take control of Danny's dragons.

A faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons.   It was also said that **Euron** might have paid **a faceless man** to **kill Balon Greyjoy** so he can become **king of the Iron Islands**. **Faceless men aren't cheap**. Euron he once had **a dragon egg** threw it in the sea, he claims... Euron gives his brother **Victarion** the **dragon horn** he has when he sends the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet to Meereen **to bring Daenerys** Targaryen back **to him**.

The God that **Melissandre** makes sacrifices to has the same [purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4). Don't forget where the faceless men started. . Bringing the **mercy of death** **to** people in **suffering** in the **fiery** **mines of Valyria**. **Whispering** a few encouraging words **in their ears**. In fact their saying is the same, **All men must die**(**slavers and masters too**). Where **Azor Ahai** was born..Where **wildfire** was discovered..

&gt; ""I Could.. but will I? (About freeing Ned) No. Questions would be asked and answers would  lead back to  me.. You have been foolish my lord. You should have heeded little finger,  when he asked you to sieze power.""(Varys to Ned)

**Varys**(who reminds me a lot of [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), the **auspicious** one, the **destroyer** ) is himself is a **faceless man**,  a mummer. Just like **Arya**, after being **sold by a Red priest**, was **found by a faceless man** and was thought how to become **no one**. That is why **Varys** can go by everywhere unnoticed. He used to be **a mummer** after all. Why he always **wears disguises** . He is the one suggesting that **Barristan Selmy** be removed from the King's Guard(another plot). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan to help Daenerys, is actually just **one of the spider's tricks** to get a father figure to inspire Danny to come home.

&gt; ""While **whispers** of a **certain eunuch's talents** **crossed the narrow sea** and **reached the ears of a certain king.**"" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)
&gt; 

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his grandfather and uncle died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, where his son, **Rhaegar was born**, **he became** **Aerys** Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then **he got  spiteful of the power of others**, especially that of his Hand of the King, **Tywin Lannister** (who had [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMtCEPNGaJw) been one of **his closest friend**s)

He is also the one telling Ned from the beginning how **the king is doomed** and he must help him. **Varys** releases Tyrion, who further kills ""his"" father, unknowingly, or perhaps on purpose fullfilling the wish of The Read Vyper(who had died for Tyrion, but also trying to bring Tywin to justice).

**Varys** always said he serves for **the good of the people**. Why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from **burning the Starks**?  ? Or help **Elaria's children**? There is no way he did not know about the **wild fire under the entire city** either. Clever **spider trap**.

&gt; ""Ah. **The children**. [It's **always** the innocents who suffer..""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJvhQ9-lsA) 
&gt; 
It was **your mercy** that killed The King"", (Varys to Ned in the dungeon)  

Remember the **Tragedy at Summerhall**? **Pyromancers** and **wildfire** causing an entire generation of **Targaryen**'s to **perish**, including one Lord Comman, known as **Ser Duncan the Tall**,  the **Lord Commander** of the Kingsguard.. The fire was said to have started when The King tried to **hatch the seven eggs** they had. They didn't succeed. **Rhaegar was born** though...


It was said that out of those **seven dragon eggs**, three **disappeared**. **Three eggs** were given as a **gift** for her **wedding** from Ilyrio Mopatis, the one who had sold her to **Khal Drogo**. You know Ilyrio! Varys's friend.  Varys was always such a good thief.

&gt; ""Trees did not grow on Braavos, save in the courts and gardens of the mighty.""(Sam)

T red priests have been manipulating Daenerys without her knowledge since the very beginning. She grew up in a house with a **red door.** She had a **lemon tree** in the garden in a city where nothing grew.  


**Ilyrio** **sold** **Daenerys** **to Khal Drogo** and gave her **three dragon eggs** as a **wedding gift** that would help bring the **doom upon Westeros** , just like Vayria of Old... Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called **The Tragedy at Summerhall**.

&gt; Rhaegar often liked to visit the **ruins of Summerhall** with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce [women](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne) to tears

**Ser Duncan** had fought and defeated **Ser Barristan Selmy** when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress** Ashara Dayne**, the girl every boy was in love with** , according to Selmy.  Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give the **masked warrior** a chance, just for a laugh. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. **A boy**, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how **Arstan** Whitebeard(anagram for R. Satan) got his nickname ""The bold""...Just like Littlefinger had lost the duel for the hand of Catelyn, Barristan would have to live with shame..   They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**... As Brandon did by the hand of The Mad King, with Littlefinger in his council..

&gt; George R.R. Martin has confirmed that one of the POV characters in A Dance with Dragons is gay and it is **implied** that this is **Jon**, who was in love with **Prince Rhaegar Targaryen**. Jon refers to Rhaegar as his ""**[silver prince](https://youtu.be/SCuXe2ZZAkU)**"" when he reminisces about him, and Jon believed Rhaegar's wife, **Elia Martell**, to have been **unworthy** of him.* 

Ser **Barristan The Bold**, just like **Brienne**, an honest knight,** loved his prince** and would have served him until the end, even going as far as taking his place[ on the battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn3_a7rC6E). 

&gt; 
&gt; ""Rhaegar's closest and oldest friend, however, was Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, trusting him more than Ser Barristan Selmy.""

It would be odd, though, given that Rhaegar's best friend was Arthur Dayne, that he would want to name him Jon. No. Jon was named after her father...



**Looking back**, Barristan was pretty **embarassed** at the **tourney**.  Just like **Littlefinger**, when he lost to **Brandon Stark**... Brandon Stark who would be **killed by fire** by the Mad King, with **Varys** in his **council**.
&gt; ""... And I admire you, Lord Baelish. A graper from a minor house, with a major talent for **befriending powerful men**. **And women**. ""(Varys)


Years later, at just **16**, at Harrenhal's tournament, where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, that [Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall, to impress **Ashara**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLUI6GxwNxk). just like **Brienne**, from the island of **saphires**, [defeatead  **Ser Loras Tyrel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU). But his love had eyes for someone else. For just like someone else we know,[Ashara was a ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYCfpeUUcw) **lady in waiting** for Ellaria Martel. And **Rhaegar's lover.**.
 **She kills herself after Robert's rebellion**, believing Rhaegar died.

&gt; *""**the blood of the dragon** **gathered** **in one** **seven eggs**, **to honour the seven gods**, though **the king's own septon had warned**: **pyromancers**, **wild fire** ... **flames grew out of control**, towering, burned so hot that  **died**, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...""* (Ser Duncan The Tall had managed, with the cost of his own life, to save a few people out of the fires. But where was Sir Barristan Selmy) 


We know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. Why would they do that? We know that Robert has fought against Barristan before and lost..

&gt; Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 


According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  

&gt; ""I told the court that Robert was hiding in the Stoney Sept, but the Hand of the King spent too much time searching the city. Something about the glory of single combat.""





&gt; 
&gt; at the Storms End tourney **Barristan** was able to unhorse **Lord Robert Baratheon**, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord **Jon Connington**, Lord Jason Mallister, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
 

 In fact we hear of even moreshameful defeat, on behalf of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Well, The Red Vyper, always with the wisdom. Because the mind behind the House of Garden is in fact [Mace Tyrell,](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface) and not his mother, the Queen of Thorns. 

Which is how he gave **Robert Baratheon** who was an unskilled fighter just like Renly,  the idea to use a warrior to fight  **Rhaegar**  in his stead. Rhaegar was as they said, not such a skilled fighter because he had started to train late, and he was never that interested.  **Barristan Selmy**, who loved his prince, decides to go fight in his stead, and defeats and kills Jon Connington. The same day, **Jon** is born. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several bastards during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight. According to a prophecy by Maggy the Frog, Robert has fathered sixteen children

In the place of Robert Baratheon you have Jon Connigton. The rubies in the ford that were scattered are more likely from the fiery hear adorned for the Lord of Light, the colours Stannis takes as well when he chooses that faith.



 [**Ashara**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne). After Robert's Rebellion, **believing** that her lover **Rhaegar** has **died**, **she kills herself**. 




Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw) on this world are almost the exact words he tells Ned when he is defeated at the battle of Ashford: ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" .. ""You'll rule.. you'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl... **Varys**, **Littlefinger**, **my brother**(all worshippers of R'hllor).. **No one to tell me no** but you.. **only you!**  



&gt; **""Let her live..."" ""Stop it if it's not to late"" ""My son  .. help him Ned. Make him better than me"".** ""My memory... King Robert Baratheon,**murdered by a pig**..""
&gt; 

So Ashara's lover couldn't have been Ned. Ashara killed herself for Rhaegar.. Too bad that Barristan Selmy loved her...

Other than that, other victims of Ser **Barristan** Sell me were [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight),  another **masked** knight who is , with his first original **brotherhood**, killed with the help of Arthur Dayne. His last words to Arthur Dayne were that he just wanted to take a **look** at his [Valyrian steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBhFLWopJa8)... Who knows, perhaps he knew where it came from.. [Arthur Dayne showed it to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkPxHxcP3Q) 
&gt; 
&gt; "" **That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne**, but someplace along the way **he had become the [Smiling Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish)** instead.*"" (Jamie Lannister)


Other **Barristan Selmy victims**? Surprisingly, all **masked warriors**. Except for [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who most likely was used as **a pawn** to kidnap the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) . He was said to have also killed ***Maelys I Blackfyre*** , the last of the **Blackfyre pretender**s, called Monstrous for supposedly having **eaten his twin in the womb**,  making him a  **kinslayer**.


&gt;  ""**Aegon the Unworthy** legitimized all his **bastard**s on his deathbed. Inevitably the greatest of these, [Daemon Blackfyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuDu43Gnyts), declared himself the rightful heir, and ignited yet another war for the crown.""

We can see why House Martell will have their reasons  to betray the **Targaryens**, who were **in bed with Dorne**, just like they do with the [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bIQ4Hh8Bo\)). Who knows what secrets had the boy seen that the Red Vyper didn't want anyone to know.. Could it be Cersei again? Or Jamie too? [He did like it like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67dKcRTGvM)

&gt;  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.


As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure.

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die, and the white walkers to bring death, for all men must serve.. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart, or a heart of ice. 

&gt; White becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world. It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart.

The book covers are meaningful too.  **A feast** for **Crows** is in **fiery read**, with a cheremonial chalice, reminding of the one Melissandre would offer to drink from? You then have **A Game** of **thrones** where the **rulers** will be the **frozen** ones and what seems to be a **Valyrian** steel sword.. A **helmet**(like the **Mountains**), against a [green **field**(the **dothraki**). A shiny **golden crown** to go with some shiny **golden** Lannister  **hair** **or** perhaps those colours were of **sand** and not of gold.. and a **white shield** with one sole dragon, protecting the realm.  A **[horn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbinder)**, in **darkness**. What the Red Priests will bring once they control the darkness.

&gt; One green and three black candles were brought to the Citadel from Valyria a thousand years before the Doom of Valyria.(white becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world). It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart. 

**The others**, are **the shadows**, that would not exist without fire, without sacrifices, to them **only death matters**. But the Night King also as his own Others.. [Ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfvRmtRMEGc) and [Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XflLYW-t2Z4), even The Water of the Drowned God all bring one thing. Death. . It corrupts those who think they master it, and their Gods always demand that their [worshippers give their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IccqnH7VJjk) to them and be **born again**. Some just lose their minds..

**Wylis's mind** died at that **gate**. He became a  fool called **Hodor**.. but the **fools** are **not** all that **they seem** in this story(Mace included)... Hodor would still react to things..**someone was still up there**, even if Wylis died.. Someone who can control minds..


&gt; The king  **the old king**, **Aerys II** Targaryen, who **had not been quite so mad in those days**, had sent his lordship **to seek a bride** **for Prince Rhaegar**, who had no sisters to wed(yet).. **We have bought his freedom** and hope to bring him home with us. **Robert will be delighted with him**, and perhaps in time he will even teach **Stannis how to laugh** (Maester Cressen regrets that Patchface  never did teach Stannis to laugh)

In his youth, Patchface was a clever boy with astonishing wit; after his accident, however, his **mind and body** are **broken**. After his **survival** from the **shipwreck** he is described as soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles and has a [weird sideways walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRR59EK9zz0). 
The ship that was supposed to bring back Rhaegar's bride was probably sunk by a sea monster controlled by the same person who took Patchface's wits.

[One of the first visions The Night King Bran The Builder has.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY) is of the Mad King wanting to burn them all, and of the **Night King** **giving life** to a baby, then of **his father,** Ned,  **dying** by **the hand** of Ilyn Payne, **old Mad King**'s man... 

**The Night King** only **awoke** when the **Mad King** started **burn**ing **Starks**(*as a sacrifice to whom I wonder*)..

**Beasts** used by the [red priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LvhZb3RgM), from the [faceless men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vwd_hrwYJg), who have used them against Valyria itself. This is why, as her beasts grow bigger, the magic of the warlocks and the red priests grows stronger as well(and faceless men too...) 

&gt; The **dragonlords of old Valyria** had controlled their mounts with **binding spells** and **sorcerous horns**. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip.




**In the beginning** it is said that the **men and the white walkers had peace**. A few things were demanded by the Night King back then.. among them was that a **Stark** will **marry a dead Queen** because.. **A Stark** Must always be **in the North** who **keeps** the **vengeful spirits in their crypts*** .
&gt; ""For thirteen years, **he** and **his Queen** ruled over **his brothers**, making **sacrifices** **as black as their cloaks**.""(**Ygritte**, **the free**)

 That **babies** of **male** descent will be offered as **sacrifice**(Because the Night Queen can't have any babies). Which is what **Craster** does beyond the wall. The fact that Craster only **offers the sons** born out of **incest** with **his** own **daughters** is already a huge send-back to the **Targaryen** dynasty. From spitting fire to spitting ice, Daenerys will become the Ice Queen. With Jon being the one kissed by fire.  **A song of Ice and Fire**, if you will. Some sort of a hot tub time machine.. As for Bran, he is the Night King, but also the builder. Men could not have built that Wall alone. Jon has to rule in the North, be the ballance between Ice and Fire with Jon actually representing the fire. He is named after  [his real father](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Connington) . 



&gt; After being freed from the **Maidenvault**, **Elaena** **outlived her siblings** and led a tumultuous life. Although Elaena had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, The lord of the Tides. She gave birth to two bastard children by him, the twins Jon and Jeyne Waters.[2] Elaena had hoped to marry Alyn, , but he was lost at sea;*..* a year after his disappearance**, **she** gave up hope and **agreed to marry another.**
&gt; 

The [faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBV0uOLx8jM) men brought **the doom on the old Valyria**, which was said that was destroyed by **raining fire**. They turned the dragons against Valyria and the dragonlords. They can also easily take control of Danny's dragons.

A faceless man is searching for a book at Old Town on the life's of dragons.   It was also said that **Euron** might have paid **a faceless man** to **kill Balon Greyjoy** so he can become **king of the Iron Islands**. **Faceless men aren't cheap**. Euron he once had **a dragon egg** threw it in the sea, he claims... Euron gives his brother **Victarion** the **dragon horn** he has when he sends the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet to Meereen **to bring Daenerys** Targaryen back **to him**.

The God that **Melissandre** makes sacrifices to has the same [purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ3K-ylk-4). Don't forget where the faceless men started. . Bringing the **mercy of death** **to** people in **suffering** in the **fiery** **mines of Valyria**. **Whispering** a few encouraging words **in their ears**. In fact their saying is the same, **All men must die**(**slavers and masters too**). Where **Azor Ahai** was born..Where **wildfire** was discovered..

&gt; ""I Could.. but will I? (About freeing Ned) No. Questions would be asked and answers would  lead back to  me.. You have been foolish my lord. You should have heeded little finger,  when he asked you to sieze power.""(Varys to Ned)

**Varys**(who reminds me a lot of [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), the **auspicious** one, the **destroyer** ) is himself is a **faceless man**,  a mummer. Just like **Arya**, after being **sold by a Red priest**, was **found by a faceless man** and was thought how to become **no one**. That is why **Varys** can go by everywhere unnoticed. He used to be **a mummer** after all. Why he always **wears disguises** . He is the one suggesting that **Barristan Selmy** be removed from the King's Guard(another plot). What seems like concern for the king, and a plan to get Barristan to help Daenerys, is actually just **one of the spider's tricks** to get a father figure to inspire Danny to come home.

&gt; ""While **whispers** of a **certain eunuch's talents** **crossed the narrow sea** and **reached the ears of a certain king.**"" (Illyrio Mopatis, A dance with Dragons)
&gt; 

In the end, the poor Mad King had not one but all of his advisers whisper bad things in his ear. Not only that, but he wasn't mad at all either. ""After his grandfather and uncle died at the **tragedy of Summerhall**, where his son, **Rhaegar was born**, **he became** **Aerys** Targaryen, the Second of His Name."" His rule started benevolent but then **he got  spiteful of the power of others**, especially that of his Hand of the King, **Tywin Lannister** (who had [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMtCEPNGaJw) been one of **his closest friend**s)

He is also the one telling Ned from the beginning how **the king is doomed** and he must help him. **Varys** releases Tyrion, who further kills ""his"" father, unknowingly, or perhaps on purpose fullfilling the wish of The Read Vyper(who had died for Tyrion, but also trying to bring Tywin to justice).

**Varys** always said he serves for **the good of the people**. Why wasn't he the one to stop The Mad King from **burning the Starks**?  ? Or help **Elaria's children**? There is no way he did not know about the **wild fire under the entire city** either. Clever **spider trap**.

&gt; ""Ah. **The children**. [It's **always** the innocents who suffer..""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJvhQ9-lsA) 
&gt; 
It was **your mercy** that killed The King"", (Varys to Ned in the dungeon)  

Remember the **Tragedy at Summerhall**? **Pyromancers** and **wildfire** causing an entire generation of **Targaryen**'s to **perish**, including one Lord Comman, known as **Ser Duncan the Tall**,  the **Lord Commander** of the Kingsguard.. The fire was said to have started when The King tried to **hatch the seven eggs** they had. They didn't succeed. **Rhaegar was born** though...


It was said that out of those **seven dragon eggs**, three **disappeared**. **Three eggs** were given as a **gift** for her **wedding** from Ilyrio Mopatis, the one who had sold her to **Khal Drogo**. You know Ilyrio! Varys's friend.  Varys was always such a good thief.

&gt; ""Trees did not grow on Braavos, save in the courts and gardens of the mighty.""(Sam)

T red priests have been manipulating Daenerys without her knowledge since the very beginning. She grew up in a house with a **red door.** She had a **lemon tree** in the garden in a city where nothing grew.  


**Ilyrio** **sold** **Daenerys** **to Khal Drogo** and gave her **three dragon eggs** as a **wedding gift** that would help bring the **doom upon Westeros** , just like Vayria of Old... Where did he find the eggs? Well, there was an incident once where a lot of Targaryens died and 3 eggs had been lost. It was called **The Tragedy at Summerhall**.

&gt; Rhaegar often liked to visit the **ruins of Summerhall** with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce [women](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne) to tears

**Ser Duncan** had fought and defeated **Ser Barristan Selmy** when Barristan was only 10 years old and participating as a Mistery knight(faceless), at Blackhaven (The Castle that was burned by the first Vulture King, a dornish prince against the first Targaryen.) Why was Barristan in the tourney at 10? Probably to impress** Ashara Dayne**, the girl every boy was in love with** , according to Selmy.  Ser Duncan was the only one willing to give the **masked warrior** a chance, just for a laugh. He defeatead him. Afterward Prince Duncan, son of King Aegon V,  helped him to his feet and removed his helm. **A boy**, he had proclaimed to the crowd. **A bold boy**.,  So that's how **Arstan** Whitebeard(anagram for R. Satan) got his nickname ""The bold""...Just like Littlefinger had lost the duel for the hand of Catelyn, Barristan would have to live with shame..   They would all die at the **Tragedy at Summerhall**... As Brandon did by the hand of The Mad King, with Littlefinger in his council..

&gt; George R.R. Martin has confirmed that one of the POV characters in A Dance with Dragons is gay and it is **implied** that this is **Jon**, who was in love with **Prince Rhaegar Targaryen**. Jon refers to Rhaegar as his ""**[silver prince](https://youtu.be/SCuXe2ZZAkU)**"" when he reminisces about him, and Jon believed Rhaegar's wife, **Elia Martell**, to have been **unworthy** of him.* 

Ser **Barristan The Bold**, just like **Brienne**, an honest knight,** loved his prince** and would have served him until the end, even going as far as taking his place[ on the battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn3_a7rC6E). 

&gt; 
&gt; ""Rhaegar's closest and oldest friend, however, was Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, trusting him more than Ser Barristan Selmy.""

It would be odd, though, given that Rhaegar's best friend was Arthur Dayne, that he would want to name him Jon. No. Jon was named after her father...



**Looking back**, Barristan was pretty **embarassed** at the **tourney**.  Just like **Littlefinger**, when he lost to **Brandon Stark**... Brandon Stark who would be **killed by fire** by the Mad King, with **Varys** in his **council**.
&gt; ""... And I admire you, Lord Baelish. A graper from a minor house, with a major talent for **befriending powerful men**. **And women**. ""(Varys)


Years later, at just **16**, at Harrenhal's tournament, where Rhaegar fell for Lyanna, that [Ser Barristan would have his revenge on Ser Duncan the Tall, to impress **Ashara**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLUI6GxwNxk). just like **Brienne**, from the island of **saphires**, [defeatead  **Ser Loras Tyrel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU). But his love had eyes for someone else. For just like someone else we know,[Ashara was a ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYCfpeUUcw) **lady in waiting** for Ellaria Martel. And **Rhaegar's lover.**.
 **She kills herself after Robert's rebellion**, believing Rhaegar died.

&gt; *""**the blood of the dragon** **gathered** **in one** **seven eggs**, **to honour the seven gods**, though **the king's own septon had warned**: **pyromancers**, **wild fire** ... **flames grew out of control**, towering, burned so hot that  **died**, but for the valor of the Lord Comman...""* (Ser Duncan The Tall had managed, with the cost of his own life, to save a few people out of the fires. But where was Sir Barristan Selmy) 


We know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. Why would they do that? We know that Robert has fought against Barristan before and lost..

&gt; Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 


According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  

&gt; ""I told the court that Robert was hiding in the Stoney Sept, but the Hand of the King spent too much time searching the city. Something about the glory of single combat.""





&gt; 
&gt; at the Storms End tourney **Barristan** was able to unhorse **Lord Robert Baratheon**, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord **Jon Connington**, Lord Jason Mallister, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
 

 In fact we hear of even moreshameful defeat, on behalf of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Well, The Red Vyper, always with the wisdom. Because the mind behind the House of Garden is in fact [Mace Tyrell,](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Patchface) and not his mother, the Queen of Thorns. 

Which is how he gave **Robert Baratheon** who was an unskilled fighter just like Renly,  the idea to use a warrior to fight  **Rhaegar**  in his stead. Rhaegar was as they said, not such a skilled fighter because he had started to train late, and he was never that interested.  **Barristan Selmy**, who loved his prince, decides to go fight in his stead, and defeats and kills Jon Connington. The same day, **Jon** is born. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several bastards during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight. According to a prophecy by Maggy the Frog, Robert has fathered sixteen children

In the place of Robert Baratheon you have Jon Connigton. The rubies in the ford that were scattered are more likely from the fiery hear adorned for the Lord of Light, the colours Stannis takes as well when he chooses that faith.



 [**Ashara**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne). After Robert's Rebellion, **believing** that her lover **Rhaegar** has **died**, **she kills herself**. 




Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw) on this world are almost the exact words he tells Ned when he is defeated at the battle of Ashford: ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" .. ""You'll rule.. you'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl... **Varys**, **Littlefinger**, **my brother**(all worshippers of R'hllor).. **No one to tell me no** but you.. **only you!**  



&gt; **""Let her live..."" ""Stop it if it's not to late"" ""My son  .. help him Ned. Make him better than me"".** ""My memory... King Robert Baratheon,**murdered by a pig**..""
&gt; 

So Ashara's lover couldn't have been Ned. Ashara killed herself for Rhaegar.. Too bad that Barristan Selmy loved her...

Other than that, other victims of Ser **Barristan** Sell me were [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight),  another **masked** knight who is , with his first original **brotherhood**, killed with the help of Arthur Dayne. His last words to Arthur Dayne were that he just wanted to take a **look** at his [Valyrian steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBhFLWopJa8)... Who knows, perhaps he knew where it came from.. [Arthur Dayne showed it to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkPxHxcP3Q) 
&gt; 
&gt; "" **That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne**, but someplace along the way **he had become the [Smiling Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish)** instead.*"" (Jamie Lannister)


Other **Barristan Selmy victims**? Surprisingly, all **masked warriors**. Except for [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who most likely was used as **a pawn** to kidnap the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) . He was said to have also killed ***Maelys I Blackfyre*** , the last of the **Blackfyre pretender**s, called Monstrous for supposedly having **eaten his twin in the womb**,  making him a  **kinslayer**.


&gt;  ""**Aegon the Unworthy** legitimized all his **bastard**s on his deathbed. Inevitably the greatest of these, [Daemon Blackfyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuDu43Gnyts), declared himself the rightful heir, and ignited yet another war for the crown."" 
&gt;     Varys



**The first person** he killed was a [Tyroshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kUmm0yenY),  ([The Band of the **Ninepenny kings**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Band_of_Nine) began their conquests by overrunning the Disputed Lands and sacking **Tyrosh**, where they set up Alequo Adarys as a tyrant... the war ended when **Ser Barristan Selmy** killed **the** **pretender** Maelys I **Blackfyre**.) **He killed the [pretender Blackfyre](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/01c23f80-2a52-4048-ad55-d525f27fe631)**. 


&gt; 


We can see why House Martell will have their reasons  to betray the **Targaryens**, who were **in bed with Dorne**, just like they do with the [Lannisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bIQ4Hh8Bo\)). Who knows what secrets had the boy seen that the Red Vyper didn't want anyone to know.. Could it be Cersei again? Or Jamie too? [He did like it like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67dKcRTGvM)

&gt;  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.


As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure. So the God of death of the faceless men are very simmilar to R'hllor, whom Melissandre prays to. Fire brings death after all, and darkness. [Valar Morgulis](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=105), all men must die, said by ex slaves while the faceless men , the men serving the God of Death, respond[ Valar dohaeris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNFjDl4l3iE)

Haven't you ever wondered **why Gregor Clegane was fighting with skinny prisoners**  who could barely hold a sword? Probably because they were **offerings to the Red God**.. Look how casually **Cersei** walks up  to him there... as if she was used to these offerings... Is it a coincidence that the **Lannister** colours are a golden **lion on a crimson field**? Just like when **Stannis** drew his **Stag over a fiery heart...**

&gt; ""**You're no Maester**.. Where's your chain?""(Jamie Lannister).... ""The Citadel **stripped me of it**. They found my experiments...**too bold**""   ""I can **take away the rotten flesh**.. and try and **burn out the corruption** ..  with any **luck** that will suffice(Qyburn)""

&gt; ""What's your name, **friend**?""... ""Qy**burn**.."" ""You're lucky to be **alive**..."" ""***Lucky***?"" 


 **The spider** who played with fire.**The** good **thief**. The one who most certainly knew about all the **secret passages** where the **Mad King** might have stored **wild fire.**.) And what **a trap** that was for the Tyrel's at **the Red Keep!** That was because The Red Keep had started **worshipping other Gods** The **wildfire** under the Red Keep  is **the light** which R'hllor uses to **destroy the Seven Gods worshippers**. All **trapped** in one place. All **offerings to the God of Fire and Death**. Qyburn is there to kill  Maester Pycelle as well..He revives the Mountain just as Thoros did. He was banned from the citadel for practicing magic.

&gt; ""It pains me, my lord..whatever your faults, you don't deserve to die alone, in such a cold, dark place..But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.."" Qyburn with Varys's [little mute devils](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silence) before killing the **old faithful Pycelle**. 

All the kids stabbed him with hatred. With revenge.. The kid who stabs Lancel Lannister looks like he feels remorse..for a Lannister. Stabs him once and runs away. But how did Qyburn just take over Varys's little whisperers? Who were said to be mute! How did he understand them?



Red Priests whisper life back into people.(So they can use them for their own means) Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? ....
Although **Daenerys** freed the people, she was still a **ruler** who would pride herself in her **old Valiryan blood**,and who would [cheat a merchant man of his price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpwtoHv8E6k), as if her cause excuses the deed. Her **Unsullied**, although forgotten, are quite the cruel warriors. In order to become Unsullied, they **must kill a baby**. Could this be an **offering to R'hllorl**? We also know that their **manhoods** are **cut off**. The same thing that happened to **Varys**.
&gt; ""The little scribe with the **big golden eyes** was **wise beyond her years.** She is **brave as well**. She had to be, to survive the life she's lived... **She relied so much on the little scribe** that she oft forgot that Missandei had only turned eleven.""(Daenerys, thinking about Missandei. 

[Missandei and Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9icZ9sfyvk) had been with **Daenerys** since she **took** over **the Unsullied** [by force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXpHvhjUzAI). 
&gt;  When Daenerys disappears on Drogon's back, **Hizdahr zo Loraq** attempts to **order** **the Unsullied** but **Grey Worm** and his men** refuse to obey him**. However when **Ser Barristan Selmy** goes to Grey Worm for his help in **seizing control** of Meereen, Grey Worm agrees to aid Selmy**. Grey Worm becomes a member of the ruling council of Meereen**. (A dance with Dragons)

**Three times** she will be betrayed. Third time is for **love**.... **Missandrei** had never taken off her slave ring from around her neck. Her clothes do look very simmilar to the actual **merchant** who wants to sell her **Daenerys** the **Unsullied she can't afford**..   **Like Mirri Maz Duur**, she **could not be freed by Daenerys** because did not need her freedom to begin with. [Look how they act in this scene with Varys](https://youtu.be/pJP9o6QMk-E), who has not been long there. ""So it's safe to say that a **fragile peace** has taken hold...""  ""***For now..***"" ""For now is the best we get in our profession""(nods at Missandei and [Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3w6c7RUbUs) and they both look at each other and then [straighten their backs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHJTYqLtRms&amp;t=31s) when Tyrion starts speaking..) Perhaps Grey Worm, as the leader of the Unsullied, was even spared his part...

&gt; ""**Grey Worm** gives this one **pride**. It is a **lucky** name. The name this one was born with was **cursed**. That was the name he had when he was taken as a **slave**. But **Grey Worm** is the name **this one** had **the day Daenerys** Stormborn **set him free**"" 

The **leader of the Unsullied** did not need her liberation. We don't know what his life might have been before, but we do know he knew Missandei, the little interpreter of the Good Masters of Astapor.
&gt; **The great goddess of the Unsullied** is called by many names, including the **Lady of Spears**, the Bride of Battle, and the **Mother of Hosts**. According to Grey Worm, her **true name** belongs only to the ones who have **burned their manhoods** upon her **altar**. The Unsullied **purify** themselves according to the laws of their great goddess; one way is to** bathe in the salt sea**. The Unsullied may not speak of the great goddess to others.


The one who truly loves Daenerys   from the [very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80KwlfqfRWk). Who did not tell her about the Varys plot, because he knew Varys was **caring for her.** We know that **Jorah** Mormont, **the bear**, who used to live in Essos, got exiled for selling slaves. right around Robert's Rebellion and he fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark.  The  only reason why **Jorah declines to take Longclaw** is because that is not his father's sword!  





&gt; What do we know about **Azor Ahai**? ([Makes me thing of the Lovecraftian demon Azathoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY-H3cwxmU)) Prohecised by the Red Prieststo** end** **the Long Night**.

**The YiTi** people say [a woman with a monkey's tail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SM3x2taiU) **restored the sun**

The conflict of Ice and Fire, from my point of view, is then the conflict between the red priests and the white walkers, the red priests wanting to bring darkness, for all men must die, and the white walkers to bring death, for all men must serve.. Their symbol is very giving, a fiery heart, or a heart of ice. 

&gt; White becomes as bright as fresh fallen snow, yellow shines like gold, reds turns to flame, and shadows become so black that they look like holes in the world. It is claimed that when the glass candles burn the sorcerers can see across mountains, seas and deserts, give men visions and dreams and communicate with one another half a world apart.

The book covers are meaningful too.  **A feast** for **Crows** is in **fiery read**, with a cheremonial chalice, reminding of the one Melissandre would offer to drink from? You then have **A Game** of **thrones** where the **rulers** will be the **frozen** ones and what seems to be a **Valyrian** steel sword.. A **helmet**(like the **Mountains**), against a [green **field**(the **dothraki**). A shiny **golden crown** to go with some shiny **golden** Lannister  **hair** **or** perhaps those colours were of **sand** and not of gold.. and a **white shield** with one sole dragon, protecting the realm.  A **[horn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbinder)**, in **darkness**. What the Red Priests will bring once they control the darkness.

The part when Arya and Jaqen talk he appears to be giving the poison to Arya but drinks it and dies. The Waif removes her face to reveal Jaqen's face.

Arya then proceeds to remove the face of Jaqen from the dead body, then reveals her own face.

So I've read the books also, my questions are: Can the faceless assassins wear the face of a living person without killing them, some form of glamor maybe?

Multiple copies of the same face, Waif Jaqen and the Jaqen face on the dead body?

I get the impression that Jaqen has been dead already and the faceless assassins wear that face throughout so we as a audience have a reference.

But is the Waif already dead like Jaqen and the face is just being used by different faceless people?

Also when Arya killed the Waif and took the face to hang on the wall, was that the the original face of the assassin, or if a faceless person wore the Waif face, would they go after Arya again?",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

At the beginning she's got a huge ego, sense of entitlement, and a quick temper. We see this pretty much all throughout some previous seasons and most of Season 7. However once she sees the Army of the Dead and Viserion is killed, her world gets turned upside down. In the span of a few minutes not only does she see that the boogeyman is real, he also just killed one of her invincible dragons, and what she feels is one of her children for that matter. This is all capped off later that day when during her silent grieving, not only does she see the man she's growing in love with return alive, she also finally realizes that Davos was being literal when he said Jon died for his people. Despite seeing the absolute worst of men all the time during her journey, she finally sees one who rose to power because he truly loves his people, and inspires them to be the best they can. 

From that point forward, she doesn't show any of the personality traits I mentioned above. Seeing her almost cry by Jon's bedside, it was like seeing the old Dany again back in S1 and S2. When Jon pledged his loyalty to her, her response wasn't ""Thank you"" or ""About time"". It was ""I hope I deserve it."" From there and Episode 7, she comes off more humble than she used to be.

I hope they continue this new development of her character into Season 8. I love Jon Snow, but just like Dany he isn't perfect. But I believe these two compliment each other so well, because they both make up for each other's flaws. While Jon can inspire Daenerys to reign her temper and ego in, and be more compassionate, Dany can make the tough decisions that Jon can't bring himself to. Not to mention get him out of trouble that his honor gets himself into.

So far, we are non the wiser about the Night Kings motives or end game.

However, from the books we learn that the crypt of Winterfell is a vast labyrinth, of tombs dating back to the the end of the long night. We also learn that the corpses, by ancient custom, are buried with heavy iron longswords accords their laps to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts
Also in the TV series, there has also been a stark absence of a character from the books.. the Night Queen.

The 'real' John Snow, was among the world's 1st epidemiologists according to Pinker. (An epidemiologist is someone who studies infectious disease.) 

The real life John Snow has been credited with saving millions of people (a little foreshadowing?) by discovering how cholera infected Londoners in the late 17 &amp; 1800s. Prior to John Snow demonstrating that Cholera was transmitted by an infected water supply, people thought that Cholera and other diseases were spread by toxic air. 

In a similar vein, the Jon Snow of GOT be responsible for discovering &amp; saving Westeros by finding linkages and truths about the army of the dead?  (Which he as already done?) 

In any event, I think its likely that that Martin at very least knew of and drew from, this part of history. 

The main character/hero /protagonist (John Snow)- resembles the efforts of the real John Snow;  and the main antagonist  (Army of the Dead) , projecting the similarities to Cholera, although that might be going a little far. 

Provided the fictious Jon Snow was indeed named and modelled after the real John Snow; its a safe bet that Jon Snow will defeat the Night King and 'save millions from an infectious disease'.

There is a 2010 notice on the Westeros site about it here ([https://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game\_of\_Thrones\_Focus\_Group\_Reports/](https://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Focus_Group_Reports/) and a blog post here ([http://princessandwarlock.blogspot.com/2010/08/event-report-song-of-ice-and-fire-focus.html](http://princessandwarlock.blogspot.com/2010/08/event-report-song-of-ice-and-fire-focus.html)) where one woman describes the experience and the kind of questions that were asked. As the Westeros article states, the focus group had actually been commissioned by HBO but the site had not been allowed to disclose that at first. 

Reading the post about the person who went to the group was interesting because in retrospect it suggests that HBO did take on board comments made in these groups about certain things, for example what people would like to see in DVD special features for the show, and what would make good taglines in the marketing. 

The impression I have had is that HBO has continued to commission focus groups throughout the duration of the show: for example, there is a June 2017 notice call asking for people to be involved in a focus group looking back at the series to date ([https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a10027859/game-of-thrones-focus-group-casting/](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a10027859/game-of-thrones-focus-group-casting/)). What I was curious about was if anyone here had ever been involved in a focus group related to the show, what the experience was like, and what kind of questions were asked, or if anyone had read any accounts of other people's experiences elsewhere.

3215,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-1-22,2019,1,22,5,aie6ck,self.gameofthrones,[Mod Raven] We've updated house flairs  here's how to show your allegiance,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aie6ck/mod_raven_weve_updated_house_flairs_heres_how_to/,BWPhoenix,1548101402,"##TL;DR Everyone can now choose house flairs. If you have one already, we'd recommend updating it with the new system. [Here's how to do it on redesign](https://i.imgur.com/ilcZVs1.png). [Here's how to do it on mobile](https://i.imgur.com/bang12T.png).

With so many people using mobile apps and more people switching to redesign, we didn't want to keep house flairs as something only old.reddit.com users could see. So, we've done a revamp of our flair system. Here's what it means:

* People who use the Reddit app/people on redesign will now be able to select a house flair
* **Those on old.reddit.com will still have the words of the flairs they've already chosen**, and can choose new words the same way, but there will be no house sigil next to their name (i.e. it'll just say ""House Stark"", without the direwolf sigil).
* **The flairs chosen on redesign/the mobile app will be visible on new reddit, old reddit, and mobile apps**

---

To pre-empt some questions people might have:

***Which flairs can we choose from?*** 

We looked at how many people use each house flair, and we've picked the top 95 (roughly...). For each of these, we've added character and house words options. We do plan on adding the rest of the sigils, but the ones we've included already are used by such a majority of people, we wanted to get them out there now. We can see if there are any issues, and people can make a start on updating their flairs.

***How do we choose them?***

On redesign, on the top panel of the sidebar, just under ""Create Post"", you'll see ""Edit user flair"". Click that. [Here's a pic](https://i.imgur.com/ilcZVs1.png)

On the mobile app, click the three dots at the top right, and then ""Edit user flair"". [Here's a pic](https://i.imgur.com/bang12T.png)

You can either scroll down to find the one you want (they're ranked by a combination of popularity+similarity), or use the search function.

***Can we request a flair?***

Yes, for now. On-season it might depend on whether the mods have time. We'd just ask that it follows a few specifications.

You can request any sigil we've already added plus:

* any character in that house from the ASOIAF universe (E.g. House Stark sigil + Brandon Stark)
* any house words (E.g. Sansa Stark sigil + Winter Is Coming)
* any character's nickname (E.g. Sand snakes sigil + Lady Nym)
* any unofficial house words (E.g. Lannister sigil + ""A Lannister Always Pays His Debts""

To request a flair, tell us in this post, or message the mods.

***I hate redesign and I don't use the Reddit app, but I want to choose an updated flair. How can I do this?***

There's a fairly substantial chance the flair you use exists on the new system, so message myself, the mods or reply here, and we'll update it for you.

***But I really love this minor house...***

You can still have their house name as your flair! Or their house words. You won't be able to have the sigil for now, but hopefully before the season that'll change.

***Can we see how many people use each flair?***

I'll use the stickied comment to show the top 10. Further than that, I'm very open to suggestions on how to present the list in an eye-pleasing way. It's 300+ flairs, so quite a lot to list.

***Can we go back to the old system please?***

Personally, I think the old flairs look nicer. It's just very hard to justify shutting so many people out of the fun of flairs for that fact, and I really like seeing them when I'm on mobile. But we're very open to feedback, and hearing how people would like these adjusted. One of the reasons for doing this now is to hear what people think well ahead of the season.

What if The Maiden is the Nights Queen? The current NK knows theyre down there. They say dragons bring back magic. Maybe NK knows he needs a dragon at Winterfell to wake up the previous kings in the crypts. They say iron rusts so the iron swords guarding the statues/sarcophagi are gone. All thats needed to awaken the dead is magic. They always say magic disappeared when dragons died out, so perhaps dragons bring back the magic. Maybe the NK NEEDS the dragons to be at Winterfell and he knows they (dragons) will be there bc he saw Jon and Dany riding one- which is why he let them go. He didnt take the dragon she was riding bc he knew they would go back to WF and dragon magic is needed to wake The Seven.

Also wanted to add: MAYBE the NK \*has\* to go to WF bc there are no Starks at WF. Its part of the pact. He (NK) is a Stark- so hes keeping the pact himself now. Sansa is a LANNISTER/BOLTON, Arya is a FACELESS MAN, Jon is a TARG, and Bran is the 3-eyed Raven. There are technically no Starks at WF at the moment. Not too confident about this last part since NK has been on the move since first episode- but I feel like the fact there are no Starks at WF has a lot to do, or will have a lot to do with whats currently happening.

Bran becomes the Three-Eyed Raven 

Arya becomes a Faceless Man

Its heavily referenced even that Robb can turn into a Wolf, which seems a nod to his warging ability from the books (havent read them myself)

Were not really given enough time with Rickon but perhaps he didnt have any special powers either. Certainly not the power of zig-zagging. So hard to say if this lines up. 

But Sansas story is all determination and perseverance. 

In S01EP04, Cersei says to Ned, She favors her mother. Not much of the North in her. Which kind of touches on Caitlyn telling Ned in the first episode that she still feels like a stranger in the north, particularly when shes in the Gods Wood.

If a 50cm Valyrian sword was worth X, a 1m Valyrian sword would be worth more than 2X.

Ice was probably one of the largest remaining Valyrian swords, so Tywin breaking it down to get two average swords seems like a terrible business decision.

Once it became clear that the dead were rising (this was generally accepted as shown by the practice of burning bodies being routine), and that White Walkers were returning, there is an obvious solution:  instead of the Battle of Castle Black, couldn't someone have offered Mance Rayder's group the possibility of occupying the abandoned castles in exchange for pledging their support to defending the wall?  Probably would have had to have someone else besides the Thenn evacuate the northernmost villages, but that would have been far less bloody than what happened, and in the end the defenses would be at full strength again.  Mance wouldn't even have to bend the knee to any King or Lord, and even if they formally were commanded by Castle Black, by strength of numbers he would be the strongest power at the wall.  Strong incentive for him to accept.

I think I have to blame Lord Commander Mormont.  He was right to bring a force north of the wall--but instead of having John kill him and engage in espionage, he should have let them be taken and made such an offer directly to Mance.   A similar idea comes up later, but it seems like it should have come up much sooner, and while Mance was still alive to provide unity.",33,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Additionally few more die hard fans are now rooting for White Walkers and the one true and (possibly) undefeated leader in the world of ASOIAF aka Night King. What i believe is very simple and it can actually unravel the myths about Night King and why White walkers are back after 8000 years after they were defeated in the Long Night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before i start let me help you recall few things happened in the TV series. Samwell Tarly wasn't killed by White Walkers. The White Walker showed him mercy, second time at the Hardhome Night King was looking into the eyes of John Snow, obviously he was looking with optimism(so many theories are already there about it but none is convincing enough). Third at John Snow's suicide mission Night King can easily kill a dragon but he did nothing against the John's men. He could've easily killed each one of them with his spears. But that's not them they don't kill people on purpose. They didn't hurt Sam because he was innocent and pure heart person just like the Night King himself. Second, John is the key to everything and Night King knows about it that he is his only hope. I will break it later.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets come to the main part of the theory, i believe Night King is too powerful to lose and no\_one can defeat him. He hasn't come to conquer but he has come to offer solution and real peace in the Realm. He was wandering in far North with his White Walkers and protecting the realm of man from themselves, because we know he was made to kill mankind by children of forest but he is man himself and part of him never wants to kill another human. The man who was turned into first White walker by Children of Forest was actually betrayed by Children and turned into deadly evil.  He was there to offer peace at the first place and his heart was pure and the purity is still living in him that is why he wasn't killing people in all these years. The magic is back to seven kingdoms since we start watching the  things on HBO premium. The dragons are back, Warlocks, White Walkers, Dire Wolfs(which are magical creatures too and far more important than dragons and too many things have are happening once again. Night King knows it is the time and that is why they are back. They want to get rid of their miserable life and wants to come back to real life. They are the only protector of realm, and they can do so by killing themselves and killing all the magic with them, so one race can't have superiority on another in ASOIF worlds, Targaryen used dragon(magical creature) to rule over the other races and control the resources and law. Just like Thanos, Night King also wants balance and it can only be achieved if magic can be ended. so far we have seen the destruction caused by the magic, souls were burn alive by Red Priestess, genitals of man/children were used for magical spells, faceless man are using black magic from centuries and don't forget first White Walker was created by magic itself. So, if White Walkers die all the magic will die with them, resulting in the balance in the realm(who is the protector of realm now). Its the Night King. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coming to the point why White walkers are back now and what is possibly going to happen next. Everyone knows John and Night King has a special connection and so does the Bran and the Night King. So, here is the catch John is way more magical creature than anyone else in the ASOIF, he had defeated one God already.....God of Death and he is way too lucky(it is magic again) than any other character in Game of Thrones. He is a special Child possessing the magical powers of  Starks and Targaryens.  Night King knows everything about him (as he is Greenseer and more powerful than Three Eyed Raven) and John with the help of Bran can defeat him and put an end to his miserable life. Don't forget he still feels like human and he is in great pain, which is his real power. His weakness is his power. But the only problem with hm is the Dragon Glass, which i think is behind the birth of Dragons also, he can't overpower the magical abilities of the dragon glass and he is controlled by it. He has to get rid of dragon glass and i don't know how but John with help of Bran will help him getting rid of dragon glass. So, he is back because John is born and Bran is there to help his brother. The Night King himself wanted to be defeated for the survival of mankind. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Anyhoo, in this clip GRRM mentions that Dany (or Emilia Clark anyway) is on location in Spain. Check it out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_0PSvGhvc

Does this mean that Dany goes to Dorne? The video itself is new, but the interview might be older so it is possible that he's reffering to a previous season's shooting, especially since shooting on eight is almost certainly wrapped. But Slaver's bay was shot in Morocco (also discussed in the video), whereas we know that Dorne was filmed in Spain.

The only logical conclusion i can make is that Dany goes to Dorne in season eight. Whyfore? Maybe to resurrect her alliance with the Dornishmen?

They may even be aided by undead soldiers if Qyburn managed to get the whole necromancering thing figured out.

Why would I think that? 

Some people have said it is interesting that the Season 8 trailer left Bran out. I think they did not, that was Bran as the Night King coming to meet Jon, Sansa and Arya in the crypts. The hint is the freezing raven feather.

Bran clearly had some connection with the Night King when he was touched by the Night King. The Night King twice left Sam alive, Sam and Bran have become friends. Bran was fortold that he would never walk again but he would fly, that is him flying on the resurrected dragon. Bran is also responsible for making King Aerys II Targaryen into the Mad King by breaking his mind like he did to Hodor trying to warg into him for some reason, maybe trying to get him to destroy all the dragon eggs stored in Kings landing. After that fails Bran is left with a last option of warging into the Night King where he will get stuck.

Dany's 3 eggs were not the only dragon eggs in the world, they were rare and precious like big gemstones, but not unheard of. There were dragon skeletons in Kings landing, I am certain there would also be eggs there. Wildfire could hatch the dragon eggs, and no viewer/reader would want to see Cersei with an army of dragons. Cersie would never team up with Jon and Dany to fight anything and Jon's whole army couldn't stand a week against the white walker army. Jon has already teamed up with the Wildlings, his former enemies - that is his MO.  Qyburn was very interested in the undead hand, his ambitions far exceed just the Mountain's resurrection.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Or more specifically, Catelyn's behavior towards Jon, while not  nice in any way, does not qualify as abuse. I also know that I'm in the  minority in this belief. And while I've seen plenty of arguments to the  contrary, I remain unconvinced.

So  here I'm opening up my views on the matter for criticism. I'll be  laying out the conditions for behavior to qualify as abuse and how  Catelyn's falls short. There are 2 ways to change my mind here - attack  the premise, i.e. convince me that my criteria is too stringent or  disprove the facts, i.e. show that what I believe to be true in the  story, isn't actually so. **Make sure  you actually read this carefully. Simply giving me examples of Catelyn's  ""horrible"" behavior and arguing ""obviously that's abuse"" isn't going to  convince me. I've seen that a thousand times already.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Catelyn's Behavior:**

First, without any value judgments or conclusion, lets lay out how Catelyn behaved towards Jon.

Its  obvious that there was never any physical harm. We have Martin's word  on that. Not only were there ever any beatings, Jon remained well-fed,  well-clothed, well taken care of in sickness, well-educated and so on.  There is no evidence that Catelyn ever tried to compromise any of his  basic needs.

Its also obvious that she  was never nice to him. She'd never had a kind words to say, no hugs for  Jon, no praises and no comfort from her. As GRRM confirmed, she mostly  just ignored him. But given that they lived in the same castle, she  couldn't have always ignored him. So here's the behavior that would be  relevant to the question.

Yes, Catelyn  would draw a clear line between her children and Jon whenever they are  in a social context. If some lords are visiting, for example, Jon would  be made to sit away from them. He'd be introduced last after all the  Starks. And she'd try to avoid making any personal introductions at all.  It is also clear, however, that Catelyn didn't simply exclude Jon from  all the social gatherings. Alys Karstark, for example, remembers  visiting Winterfell and dancing with both Jon and Robb.

I  also don't think that she ever yelled or made explicitly cruel remarks  towards Jon. Not because she is kind-hearted or anything - but because  that would be unladylike. Maintaining courtesy and decorum would be of  highest priority for a lady like Catelyn and she'd instead let her  demeanor and body-language do the talking for her. A cold look when  thrown his way, turning away if he ever approaches her and occasional  cutting remark would be the extent of her behavior. We know that she  never called him ""Jon"", but always calling him ""bastard"" would be too  uncouth for her. If she had to talk to him or about him, she likely just  called him ""Snow"" or ""boy"".

I also  don't see any evidence of her trying to isolate Jon from the other  children. Yes, others would've picked up on her coldness and drawn their  conclusions - Robb, Sansa and Arya certainly did - but I think their  relationship with Jon would've been much, much worse if Catelyn had been  actively poisoning their minds against him. Jon was allowed to sleep  with his brothers, train with them, play with them, take his lessons  with them and so on - clearly Cat never tried to interfere with any of  it.

**This,  IMO, is the sum of Cat's actions towards Jon. If I'm missing something  here or if you know of her having done worse, provide examples.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Catelyn's Obligation:**

This  is the biggest stumbling block for me in believing that Catelyn's  behavior qualifies as abuse. If you want to convince me otherwise, this  point *has* to be addressed.

Whether  or not something qualifies as abuse depends on the relationship.  Behavior that is natural/acceptable in one relationship can be abusive  in others. For example, you can expect your wife to give you emotional  support after a hard day, but not your colleagues.

For  me, choice is a necessary factor for there to be any obligation.  Parents choose to have children, so they are obligated to love and  support them. If you choose to marry someone, you are obligated to  provide them emotional comfort. If you choose to employ someone, you are  obligated to treat them fairly. This applies even to step-mothers -  since they chose to marry someone who already has children, they are  obligated to take on the responsibilities of a mother. If you cannot  live up to your obligations, you are free to opt out of the  relationship. But without a choice, there can be no obligation.

Catelyn  doesn't have a choice here. She didn't choose to make Ned have an  affair. She didn't choose to have him bring Jon back home. She can't  choose to have him sent away, since Ned wouldn't allow him. She can't  even choose to leave, since divorce isn't an option in Westeros. So  since she had no choice in Jon being in her presence, she has no  obligation towards him.

Except for the  obligation that comes with being a lady of her status. She did choose to  be the Lady of Winterfell and to that extent, she is responsible for  taking care of everyone living under her aegis. She is obligated to  provide them food, clothing, sufficient material comforts, education  etc. But she is not obligated to provide them with emotional comfort.  For that, they have to rely on their parents or family members.

**This,  IMO, is the extent of Cat's obligation towards Jon - she is obligated  to provide for him as well as she would provide for any servants'  children, but not any better. For any emotional support or self-esteem  issues, Jon has to turn to his father or other parental figures.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Contextual Child-rearing:**

This  is something else to keep in mind - the standards of child-rearing  differ with time and place. Even today, behavior that you'd consider  abusive in US would be considered normal in China. This is something one  should keep in mind before considering one's standards to be absolute.

Westeros  clearly prefers a more hands-off form of parenting. They believe that  coddling the children too much would make them soft and weak and unfit  to thrive in their harsh world. They regularly send off very young  children to live with complete strangers where there is no guarantee  that they'd be treated well and expect them to deal with it. Even Ned  engages in behavior that might be considered that might be considered  abusive. Taking a 7-year old Bran to a behading is one. Making him stay  awake all night, outside and in the cold, is another. But none of this  is abusive because this behavior is the norm for Westerosi parents. So  what matters here is if treatment of a child is *markedly and significantly* worse than that of his peers.

So  let's compare Jon to his siblings. I see no evidence that Catelyn  excessively fawned over any of her children. Their lessons would be left  to Maester Luwin, training to Rodrick Cassel or Septa Mordane, Old Nan  would tell them stories and there were servants for a whole bunch of  other things. Catelyn would be too busy actually running the household  to obsess over her children. She'd keep an eye on them, ofcourse, and  they'd come to her for love and comfort, but she wouldn't be like Lysa  or Cersei who focus extensively on their children.

Especially  in public, Catelyn is unlikely to show her children any overt affection  - like letting them sit on her lap or hugging them or praising their  little achievements to the sky. We already saw how she took care to be  reserved when she met Robb again at Moat Cailin - waiting until  everybody had left before even coming close to him. Maintaining  boundaries - and more importantly, teaching children to maintain  boundaries, would be a significant part of how she treats her children.  So to the modern eye, she'd likely come off as cold and distant to her  own kids - when we know from her pov that she is nothing of the sort.

**So  the question here is is her treatment of Jon significantly different  from her treatment of other children? Its different, yes, but is it  significant enough? Would a complete stranger visiting Winterfell make  note of how differently she treats Jon as opposed to, say, Jeyne Poole  and conclude that there is something off there? I doubt that, but feel  free to argue otherwise.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Damage to Jon:**

One  of the ways to determined abuse is to see if the victim shows clear  indications of being abused. But even this isn't conclusive except in  the most extreme of cases. A child being somewhat withdrawn or more  mature or having low self-esteem can easily be explained in ways other  than abuse or neglect.

Jon is somewhat  withdrawn, yes, but not to a crippling degree. He shows no impediment in  social contexts and being reserved can easily be explained by having a  naturally shy disposition. He has some self-esteem issues about being a  bastard, but is it worse than it'd be for some other bastard? That is,  would these issues be any different had Catelyn not been there at all? I  doubt that - bastards are reminded constantly by the society that they  don't have a real place in their father's home. Even if Catelyn hadn't  been there to draw this line, others would have. Being ""wiser than their  age"" isn't necessarily indicative either - kids can be smart and  observant without being abused.

And  Jon's issues don't seem excessive to me either. He clearly had pride in  being a Stark by blood. He had expectations that came with the status -  like being treated in a particular way at the Night's Watch. He had  pride in his skills and abilities. He had none of the crippling  self-doubt that comes with being abused. At most, he comes off as a  somewhat withdrawn and moody teenager - you don't have to be abused to  be angsty.

**So, IMO, Jon's behavior and issues are the natural result of his age and his status in life. Apart from those, he is an** 

**intelligent,  empathetic, confident, well-behaved and well-adjusted young man. On the  whole, there are no conclusive signs of abuse.**

&amp;#x200B;

So  these are the reasons which, taken together, make me conclude that  accusing Catelyn of abusing Jon is excessive and unwarranted. And since  the conclusion is based on all of them taken together, I'd say that you  have to convince me on atleast 2 points to change my mind. The second  one - about Catelyn's obligation - is the one I consider most important.  Its likely that I will change my mind if you manage to disprove only  that one. Its also likely that I won't change my mind if you fail  disprove that one specifically. **But  atleast try to stick to the subject here. Random Catelyn-bashing would  be pointless and would only tell me that you are arguing from bias.**",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Yes, Catelyn  would draw a clear line between her children and Jon whenever they are  in a social context. If some lords are visiting, for example, Jon would  be made to sit away from them. He'd be introduced last after all the  Starks. And she'd try to avoid making any personal introductions at all.  It is also clear, however, that Catelyn didn't simply exclude Jon from  all the social gatherings. Alys Karstark, for example, remembers  visiting Winterfell and dancing with both Jon and Robb.

I  also don't think that she ever yelled or made explicitly cruel remarks  towards Jon. Not because she is kind-hearted or anything - but because  that would be unladylike. Maintaining courtesy and decorum would be of  highest priority for a lady like Catelyn and she'd instead let her  demeanor and body-language do the talking for her. A cold look when  thrown his way, turning away if he ever approaches her and occasional  cutting remark would be the extent of her behavior. We know that she  never called him ""Jon"", but always calling him ""bastard"" would be too  uncouth for her. If she had to talk to him or about him, she likely just  called him ""Snow"" or ""boy"".

I also  don't see any evidence of her trying to isolate Jon from the other  children. Yes, others would've picked up on her coldness and drawn their  conclusions - Robb, Sansa and Arya certainly did - but I think their  relationship with Jon would've been much, much worse if Catelyn had been  actively poisoning their minds against him. Jon was allowed to sleep  with his brothers, train with them, play with them, take his lessons  with them and so on - clearly Cat never tried to interfere with any of  it.

**This,  IMO, is the sum of Cat's actions towards Jon. If I'm missing something  here or if you know of her having done worse, provide examples.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Catelyn's Obligation:**

This  is the biggest stumbling block for me in believing that Catelyn's  behavior qualifies as abuse. If you want to convince me otherwise, this  point *has* to be addressed.

Whether  or not something qualifies as abuse depends on the relationship.  Behavior that is natural/acceptable in one relationship can be abusive  in others. For example, you can expect your wife to give you emotional  support after a hard day, but not your colleagues.

For  me, choice is a necessary factor for there to be any obligation.  Parents choose to have children, so they are obligated to love and  support them. If you choose to marry someone, you are obligated to  provide them emotional comfort. If you choose to employ someone, you are  obligated to treat them fairly. This applies even to step-mothers -  since they chose to marry someone who already has children, they are  obligated to take on the responsibilities of a mother. If you cannot  live up to your obligations, you are free to opt out of the  relationship. But without a choice, there can be no obligation.

Catelyn  doesn't have a choice here. She didn't choose to make Ned have an  affair. She didn't choose to have him bring Jon back home. She can't  choose to have him sent away, since Ned wouldn't allow him. She can't  even choose to leave, since divorce isn't an option in Westeros. So  since she had no choice in Jon being in her presence, she has no  obligation towards him.

Except for the  obligation that comes with being a lady of her status. She did choose to  be the Lady of Winterfell and to that extent, she is responsible for  taking care of everyone living under her aegis. She is obligated to  provide them food, clothing, sufficient material comforts, education  etc. But she is not obligated to provide them with emotional comfort.  For that, they have to rely on their parents or family members.

**This,  IMO, is the extent of Cat's obligation towards Jon - she is obligated  to provide for him as well as she would provide for any servants'  children, but not any better. For any emotional support or self-esteem  issues, Jon has to turn to his father or other parental figures.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Contextual Child-rearing:**

This  is something else to keep in mind - the standards of child-rearing  differ with time and place. Even today, behavior that you'd consider  abusive in US would be considered normal in China. This is something one  should keep in mind before considering one's standards to be absolute.

Westeros  clearly prefers a more hands-off form of parenting. They believe that  coddling the children too much would make them soft and weak and unfit  to thrive in their harsh world. They regularly send off very young  children to live with complete strangers where there is no guarantee  that they'd be treated well and expect them to deal with it. Even Ned  engages in behavior that might be considered that might be considered  abusive. Taking a 7-year old Bran to a behading is one. Making him stay  awake all night, outside and in the cold, is another. But none of this  is abusive because this behavior is the norm for Westerosi parents. So  what matters here is if treatment of a child is *markedly and significantly* worse than that of his peers.

So  let's compare Jon to his siblings. I see no evidence that Catelyn  excessively fawned over any of her children. Their lessons would be left  to Maester Luwin, training to Rodrick Cassel or Septa Mordane, Old Nan  would tell them stories and there were servants for a whole bunch of  other things. Catelyn would be too busy actually running the household  to obsess over her children. She'd keep an eye on them, ofcourse, and  they'd come to her for love and comfort, but she wouldn't be like Lysa  or Cersei who focus extensively on their children.

Especially  in public, Catelyn is unlikely to show her children any overt affection  - like letting them sit on her lap or hugging them or praising their  little achievements to the sky. We already saw how she took care to be  reserved when she met Robb again at Moat Cailin - waiting until  everybody had left before even coming close to him. Maintaining  boundaries - and more importantly, teaching children to maintain  boundaries, would be a significant part of how she treats her children.  So to the modern eye, she'd likely come off as cold and distant to her  own kids - when we know from her pov that she is nothing of the sort.

**So  the question here is is her treatment of Jon significantly different  from her treatment of other children? Its different, yes, but is it  significant enough? Would a complete stranger visiting Winterfell make  note of how differently she treats Jon as opposed to, say, Jeyne Poole  and conclude that there is something off there? I doubt that, but feel  free to argue otherwise.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Damage to Jon:**

One  of the ways to determined abuse is to see if the victim shows clear  indications of being abused. But even this isn't conclusive except in  the most extreme of cases. A child being somewhat withdrawn or more  mature or having low self-esteem can easily be explained in ways other  than abuse or neglect.

Jon is somewhat  withdrawn, yes, but not to a crippling degree. He shows no impediment in  social contexts and being reserved can easily be explained by having a  naturally shy disposition. He has some self-esteem issues about being a  bastard, but is it worse than it'd be for some other bastard? That is,  would these issues be any different had Catelyn not been there at all? I  doubt that - bastards are reminded constantly by the society that they  don't have a real place in their father's home. Even if Catelyn hadn't  been there to draw this line, others would have. Being ""wiser than their  age"" isn't necessarily indicative either - kids can be smart and  observant without being abused.

And  Jon's issues don't seem excessive to me either. He clearly had pride in  being a Stark by blood. He had expectations that came with the status -  like being treated in a particular way at the Night's Watch. He had  pride in his skills and abilities. He had none of the crippling  self-doubt that comes with being abused. At most, he comes off as a  somewhat withdrawn and moody teenager - you don't have to be abused to  be angsty.

**So, IMO, Jon's behavior and issues are the natural result of his age and his status in life. Apart from those, he is an intelligent,  empathetic, confident, well-behaved and well-adjusted young man. On the  whole, there are no conclusive signs of abuse.**

&amp;#x200B;

So  these are the reasons which, taken together, make me conclude that  accusing Catelyn of abusing Jon is excessive and unwarranted. And since  the conclusion is based on all of them taken together, I'd say that you  have to convince me on atleast 2 points to change my mind. The second  one - about Catelyn's obligation - is the one I consider most important.  Its likely that I will change my mind if you manage to disprove only  that one. Its also likely that I won't change my mind if you fail  disprove that one specifically. **But  atleast try to stick to the subject here. Random Catelyn-bashing would  be pointless and would only tell me that you are arguing from bias.**",112,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

My plan would be dragon focused:

1) Stop having sex with brother for a few weeks/months to put together a plan

2) Plan consists of mass producing scorpions to secure the cities and shipping lanes

3) Continuous testing on various bolt designs. Hollowpoints, poison tipped etc

4) Support with modified seige weaponry, also testing experimental ammunition. Does wildfire finish a downed dragon or just make it stronger? Starving brother has to find this out for me if he hopes to ever get any again.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the key for all this: I'm not looking to actually kill the dragon, but force it into the fringes. 

If the dragon has to take huge risks in battle it can not reign free like it did in the Lannister battle. That returns power back to manned armies and brings the Lannisters back into a somewhat even matchup.

Scorpions and modified seige weapons do become a target to defend though, adding to the complexity for the field commanders.

1 According to the Geography of Florida, a very low land on sea level characterized by small hills of no more than around 50 m could encircle the Neck area and force both a central swamy region and from there the River could flow with a very minimal pendence and so a very quite flow toward south ...

I'm asking this question because where I'm currently in the series people act like The Mountain is nearly unkillable one on one. 
 
I understand the Red Viper defeated him with a spear but Im talking just swordsmen to swordsmen through technique. 

So could a prime Jamie Lannister(prior to the behanding), Selmy, Bronn, Hound, or Brienne or any other person up to the end of season 4 take on The Mountain and win? If so how?

Many have speculated that this is a hint to her fate, as Jaime is standing on The Fingers, and this confirms he will play the role of the 'valonqar' from Maggy The Frog's prophecy. However I recalled that when fire and ice meet in the S8 teaser, it appears the location is at The Neck, and a wall of dragonglass forms. Some speculate this implies this is where the 'final stand' against the White Walkers will take place because of that, and also the Necks strategic geography. No one has been able to invade the North because of the Neck and Moat Cailin. Wouldn't it be fitting then to reverse this, and the White Walker's can't invade the South because of the Moat?

The Vale only followed him (and Sansa because of him) due to his marriage to Lysa. 

In Season 4 when Lysa died the Knights of the Vale were ready to kill little finger for her murder, the only reason they didn't is because Sansa lied for him and agreed with his story, that she did infact commit suicide.

We were shown before this how loyal the Vale were to the Aryn family, the Knights worshipped them and would do anything for them. They end up following littlefinger because he has a hold over Robin. 

Will these men honestly stay following the Starks now they have found out that Sansa played a huge part in covering up this murder? Can we even expect the show to cover this aspect of the plot? 

I am honestly interested in people's opinions on this matter, can we really say Sansa is coming into her own and learning to play the game when her first bold move will alienate one of their largest allies. Do you think the Knights of the Vale will stand by the Starks after this?

They'll take 2 characters that we don't expect and unite them as the king and queen.  Both characters will do something exceptional to justify their elevation to become king and queen.  My guess is Gendry will forge a dragon glass tipped spear and will launch it from another dragon killing device that Qyburn will build.  Gendry will kill the Night King's dragon.  Arya will take the face of a White Walker so she can get close enough to the Night King to kill him with the Valyrian dagger.   Gendry's and Arya's marriage will unite House Stark and House Baratheon which will be acceptable for the 7 kingdoms.  Daenerys and Jon will die in the battle so they won't be alive and they are related anyway so that wouldn't work out for a marriage.

By creating a new Wall imbued with the magic from the lord of light? Leaving the north lost to the remaining white walkers for another 1000 years or more. Just a theory.

So there are 2 events which are very close and have some of the cast attending. The first event which is London film and comic con spring has 2 cast confirmed so far announcements still to come and Joffrey and Tywin will be attending. The event is on the 2nd of March till the 3rd. The second event is Walker Stalker con and is mainly based for the walking dead fans as it is meant to be dedicated to them but luckily they have some great cast from GOT attending. They have Sam, Bran, Gilly and Hodor attending and this is on the second weekend or the third weekend of March.

Im not trying to make an ad or anything for the events but just trying to give some fans of the show the knowledge that then can meet some of their possible favourites from the show.

Many people are kicking off, claiming that we've been misled, that these runtimes aren't what we were told to expect, and more. But there's one fact these people are forgetting; we were never told we would have a season of 2-hour episodes. Not once.

The only quotes I can find online state that some episodes may be feature length, and one that actually says exactly this;*We havent had that discussion yet because I dont know how long the episodes are going to be. Two hours per episode seems like it would be excessive, but its a great show, so who knows? Casey Bloys.*

And we *are* having feature length episodes. Two thirds of the episodes are as long as a movie each, albeit a movie that's on the shorter side of the scope. For a fantasy show with a cast, budget, and production scale as large as this, we should actually consider ourselves damn lucky that we're still getting this much despite the increasing scope of the show. This is a massive step up from the lengths of previous average episodes; pretty much a 50% increase.

I remember when this whole 2-hour episode thing started, and it's literally down to nothing other than fans taking that previous quote I mentioned, getting ridiculously over-excited with it, and creating their own expectation that we would have 2-hour episodes. This kind of thing needs to stop. It's a perfect example of people over-hyping season 8 to the point where it simply won't live up to our expectations, and this reaction has proved that.

Basically, I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post is other than to rant. D&amp;D are getting so much shit right now from entitled brats who seem to be forgetting that they're still delivering us the biggest fantasy TV show that has ever graced TV. How about we start, I don't know, actually fully appreciating this amazing show and all the work that's gone into it? Sounds like a good plan to me.

TLDR: We were never actually told we would get 2-hour episodes - it's just some fans taking quotes out of context and building up unreasonable expectations out of over-excitement, spreading this all over the internet, then getting entitled when these unrealistic expectations aren't met.

Any reason why the Lord of Light requires blood and sacrifice (death) to work his magic? and the Night King needs babies (life) and brings the dead back to life?  


Lord of Light = Death    Night King = Life      (???)  


Seems like there could be a twist coming to make us empathise with the Night King and the Lord of Light could be ushering in the long night? Might be a bitch of a stretch.

I've been seeing a lot of these, here's how I think it will end. This got a bit long, but I would be happy if you read it and wanted to discuss! I will warn you that I am long winded and I have not read the books, although I have some amount of book knowledge just from being on here and reading some wikipedia articles.

**1. Humanity will defeat the Night King. I think that either Jon or Dany will survive the battle, but not both**

They might both survive, but I just doubt it. I know people say that it's still been a tragic journey, etc, but I feel like if the show ends with the 2 (potential) chosen ones : 
-discovering/being reunited with their family 
-falling in love 
-having a baby 
-becoming king and queen

...that's just a little bit Happily Ever After to be the ending that's been hinted at. And even though they'd surely lose friends along the way and possibly even Bran, it feels a little too neat.

I will admit that since we don't know exactly how long the books will go past the fall of the Night King, there is some potential for them both to survive and run into reality to complicate things. Or maybe it really will end with them going off into the sunset together. But I can't help but feel like they're going to get boatsexbaby just in time to save its remaining parent from being ""A Targaryan alone in alone in the world"".

**2. I think Jon will probably be the one to die, between the two of them**

So it's not much of a leap to think that the fight against the Night King and his army is related to magic coming back into the world. And given the man of the Night's watch had betrayed his vows after seeing the White Walkers at the very beginning of the series, that's probably the one that came first. So I think that both of our two potential chosen ones got something magical to use in their war against the Others, and when they win they're going to have to give it back.

Sadly (at least for me, because I love Drogon and Rhaegal) I think that for Dany, that means she's going to lose her dragons. Odds are she'll lose them in the fighting, but they'll turn the tide of war for humanity first.

For Jon, he was sent back because he still had a mission- to defeat the Night King. When he's completed that mission, it's not such a stretch to think that his borrowed time will be up. So I think he'll fall but bring the Night King down with him.

It makes sense, in a way. The magic was brought back to fight the Others, and when they are defeated, the magic is going to go back out of the world. Of course I don't think they'll be that textually explicit about why Jon and the dragons die, but it makes a sad poetic kind of sense.

**3. Arya will take care of Cersei**

In my estimation, Jon and Daenerys are the main protagonists, but Arya has had a lot of focus for a reason. She's had a long journey to become both an assassin but still Arya Stark, and she hasn't really done that much with it. In the books she wasn't even the one to kill the Freys. All of the ""original 5"" at this point sort of have their endgame arcs clear, except her.

Bran's journey has been about learning to access his visions, allowing them to discover how to defeat the Night King (I'm not convinced that the NK is going to be anything other than an unknowable evil). I suspect Jon is the prince that was promised, he was the first to rally men against the darkness and he will strike the killing blow. Daenerys finally understands why she has her dragons and how to use them in defense of the realm instead of to conquer it. Afterwards, when she assumes the Iron Throne and decides what kind of world she wants to make, Tyrion will be at her side to guide her. And after all these years of being sickened and ignored by shit rulers, he's finally found someone worth serving, that will appreciate his talents and listen to his counsel as they try to imagine how to structure a better world.

So that's nice, all tied up with a bow. So where does Arya fit it? I admit that having her be the one to take down Cersei is still kind of weak tea, especially after they defeat the Night King. But there's something to be said for killing without honor, especially when it allows one mad woman to die instead of untold innocents to starve in a lengthy siege or burn with wildfire. And maybe there'll be another role for this version of Arya that will tie in better that I'm not even considering.

**4. There isn't going to be an Iron Throne anymore**

So in this part, talking about what I think is going to happen after the wars I'm mostly assuming that Dany and her child live, but Jon doesn't. I think that most of this could almost just as easily work with Jon and their child, though, if Dany turns out to be the one who dies. Or even with both of them alive.

I think that once their enemies have been struck down and it is time to rule, Dany (and Tyrion) will restructure power in Westeros. Instead of a single King holding absolute power, it will be shared.

They will give some portion of it to the lords, some portion of it to the small folk, but still retain a more limited monarchy with a different chair. Maybe even something where each kingdom is given equal representation on the small council.

It won't be a mummer's monarchy, to be certain- the Queen will still rule. But there will checks on her powers, and she will hold herself accountable to the people she governs. I think that Daenerys and Tyrion will realize that if she assumes absolute power, no matter what good she does with it during her lifetime, if there's still an Iron Throne in play then it just takes one shitty descendent to undo all of it. Jaeherys I was what, 2 generations away from the Dance of Dragons? The only way to create sustainable change is to change the institutions. And that means letting go of the Iron Throne.

I do wonder how much time they'll take/have to explore things like how they handle victory. I think it will be hard for Daenerys to give up power, regardless of how well she knows it's for the long term good of the Realm. Especially in the midst of mourning her dragons, she's going to feel insecure, voluntarily weakening her position.

Personally, I find that I'd be more interested in that part of the story than watching the epic fight scenes, but I'm probably in the minority. Regardless of who lives, who dies, or who ends up with what kind of throne, I think that rebuilding Westeros in the aftermath of the Great War and all the other wars is going to be a difficult business.

Some things seem easy- certainly I hope and expect that Daenerys will do away with the Great Council of 101 AC. Other things are more difficult. If Sansa Stark and the North sue for independence, does she let them go? If they do, who goes next? Who, if anyone, should be installed in the numerous vacant seats of the once great and noble houses of Westeros?

Does she try to keep the Dothraki in Westeros, knowing that it will be an endless struggle to contain them, or does she send them back to Essos where they will probably go right back to their old ways? Is there any way for her to ensure her continued vision in Mereen without her dragons?

I don't need or expect the show to address any specific one of these questions- just to acknowledge that it gets even harder once the wars are won, especially for a conqueror.

**5. It's time for the Age of Men in Westeros**

This one I'm a little hesitant about. I don't think the entire planet instantly drained of anything magical the second the Night King fell, especially in places like Old Valyria. But I do think that it's going to be draining out of the world, and in its wake will coincide a new era for men, where they can establish greater traditions than might makes right. I'm hesitant about this because it sounds just like Tolkien, and I feel like GRRM must surely have something planned besides that.

That said, I'm not sure how else this ends. At the end of the day as far as I can see it boils down to either:

1. Night King wins
2. Jon and/or Dany win and set up their kingdom in a way that preserves Targaryen Exceptionalism and starts the whole Fire and Blood shitshow up again.
3. Jon and/or Dany win and weaken the throne in order to move Westeros more towards a system that would be resilient against being subdued by an unjust monarch.
4. Humans win but all the likely candidates to take and hold the throne are dead, so Westeros devolves right back into 7 or more warring kingdoms, each with their own little lord that thinks this is his moment to seize power.

Anyways. I recognize that there are lots of other ways it could go, but I feel like this one is the most likely. I don't really like it though.",51,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I loved Black Sails so much that I watched it two times in a row, so my expectations were high.

Now, I have just finished the third season, and I am competely uninterested in the show. Watching each new episode seems more like a chore than an actual enjoyable experience. Granted, I did know a few of the big spoilers before watching (fuck you high school friends), but I just find all the betrayals and supposedly ""epic"" scenes to be overly dramatic and even corny at times.

\-will have a child with Daenerys;

\-will die.

He has accomplished everything by being Ned Stark's bastard son: Lord Commander, King in the North, Daenerys' lover. There was no need to make him a Targaryen. Jon Snow has achieved the feat of being accepted by all for his merits despite his bastardy. He even being loved by a powerful queen. He could thus have united North and South by marrying Daenerys, having a child and so on.

Except no, George RR Martin has made Jon a Targaryen, Daenerys' nephew and a serious contender for the iron throne.

Why ?

Jon received a Stark education and incest is a serious sin. He is a man of honor, he surely can't abandon his honor, his morals and his education to continue a relationship with his aunt. If he can not lie to Cersei for the good of humanity, I imagine he can't continue a relationship with his aunt, especially if it has just begun. In addition, the author strongly denounces incest and reminds us of the problems that entails (madness ...). How can Jon &amp; Daenerys have a child if we do not know what will become of him in 20 years?

Then, Daenerys always believed to be the legitimate queen. She killed people and took control of territories based on this right. If Jon has the same right, it's a problem. It calls into question her convictions, her decisions, her actions and her sovereignty. In addition, some people followed her thinking that. But if another pretender appears, there is a risk of division. Not to mention the fact that Jon &amp; Daenerys do not have the same vision of things, nor the same education. We are not in a nice story where everything is resolved by love / magic. This is a story where the title is about the games of the throne. The Jon &amp; Daenerys relationship is one.

George RR Martin said he did not want to write a story with nice heroes against nasty villains. But more a story with gray characters who are the heroes of their own story and who end up opposing each other such Hector and Achilles. Choose our side becomes difficult because we know the 2 opponents and we are attached to them.

Which makes me say that season 8 is going to be hard to watch. We risk seeing the 2 main characters to oppose even if they are both the heroes of their story and thinks they are right.

I will also add that when I hear the showrunners, Kit &amp; Lena joking about a Targaryen baby in the season 7 comments, I tell myself there is a concern. They can not talk so openly about a future spoiler. Unless... it does not happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason we see Jon getting intimate with Dany is actually because of Tyrion.

Tyrion is concerned of what will happen on the day Dany no longer rules.

Tyrion then learns that Cersei is yet again with child which troubles Tyrion further more as he explicitly says he believes Dany should rule and thereby her offspring.

The scene where we see Tyrion outside the cabin is to understand that it is partially planned by Tyrion as a mean against Cersei and her progeny (should they  beat the Night King).

1: white walkers win. This could be one of the craziest endings in then history of television. Making the bad guys win could be about how the good guys dont always win.
2: I would like to see an ending where tyrion and sansa are rulling the kingdom. These are two people that have faced alot of hardship and it would be cool to see them winning in the end. In this ending almost every main character would die.
Bad endings
1: If after eveything deanerys sits the throne. This might just be cause i dont like the character  but i also think its to textbook for a show like GoT. 
2: Having jon sit the throne doesnt seem like it fits his arc. His goal is just to stop the whites and when/if he does he should go to.

* His family sigil is a Mockingbird - he's Braavosi - Baelish is a cover
* Braavos is full of money and he is always paying people off for information
* There's no distinct identity in Braavos so nobody can attribute family to him
* Wealthy and powerful Braavosi favour wearing dark colours - Littlefinger does
* Littlefinger used the same poison on Joffrey that the faceless men use
* The Fingers in The Eyrie are just across the water from Braavos
* House Baelish was founded by Baelish's great-grandfather, a sellsword from Braavos
* The city of Braavos was established by a large group of slaves
* Petyr downplays his partial descent from the Free Cities of the east, even abandoning the use of the original sigil of House Baelish, displaying the Titan of Braavos, to his own personal sigil featuring a mockingbird. 
* The Andals landed on the Fingers during their invasion of Westeros
* We know he has ships in service that belong to him
* The sigil of House Baelish is  or was  the grey stone head with fiery eyes of the Titan of Braavos, on a light green field
* Littlefinger clearly notices Arya's ""water dancing"" when fighting
* He is counter stalking Arya so expect some counter to her and Sansa's moves
* The Faceless Men come from Valyria and he has a Valyrian steel dagger
* He worships the many faced God as well


I don't think he's dead. I think he is on a revenge mission. His family are Braavosi, and the descendants of slaves, and the House Baelish moniker simply gives him minor nobility and an in into the system work his way up the ladder, and a cover, hence the Mockingbird sigil. They would not accept a Braavosi into the system due to nobility restrictions, and therefore he could never climb the ladder as one. The only reason he's a Baelish is because it's a cover.

After losing his duel with Ned for Catelyn, he leaves and it's claimed he returns to The Fingers, but I doubt it. Due to wanting to get back at them, I think, due to history, and wanting revenge, he went to Braavos to find out for himself. He goes there, and becomes a faceless man, which is why he realises Arya water dancing and picks up on the 'no one' remark, only with intent to return to Westeros to climb the ladder, but to do that, he needs to create chaos, because chaos is the ladder as he tells Varys.

So what does he do? Well, he recommends Syrio to Ned to train Arya, and we don't know for sure that Syrio is dead, or his true identity. Then Littlefinger tells Ned, ""I did warn you not to trust me"" which results in Ned's death and is the catalyst for all the events that play out, in other words, the chaotic chain that becomes Littlefinger's ladder.

Then look at his quotes:

&gt; Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are likely to do next. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you. Remember that, Sansa, when you come to play the game.

He has everyone confused. Even Varys, another manipulator has admitted only the Gods know what game Littlefinger is playing.

&gt; ""You know what I learnt losing that duel? I learnt that I'll never win. Not that way. That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them, I'm going to f**k them. That's what I know, that's what I am, and only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.""

He is clearly on a revenge mission.

&gt; ""What we don't know is what usually gets us killed.""

Yes, like not knowing he is still alive, actually from Braavos, on a revenge mission, and a faceless man that has a load of wealth behind him. I also think he knows how to fight well as he was pretty well versed in pinning Ned, yet to the others he plays himself off as the calm and manipulative scheming type without any real fighting credentials. I think he hides this, or when he fights he does so using other faces to hide his true capabilities.

&gt; ""Ah, the Starks, quick tempers, slow minds.""

And this is what's going to come back to bite Arya and Sansa in the ass.

&gt; ""And not long after that, when I saw you escorting a certain... foreign dignitary... council business? Of course, you would have friends from across the narrow sea. You're from there yourself. After all, we're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the king might question my friend's sympathies, to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm...""

This is a bluff and projection. He accuses Varys of what he's guilty himself of. He's doing the classic Donald Trump of accusing his enemies of what he himself is doing.

&gt; ""Brothels make a much better investment than ships Ive found. Whores rarely sink""

Brothels were a cover. We know he owns ships.

&gt; Theres no justice in the world, not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them

He says this to Sansa because this is how he feels. He loved his family, who were Braavosi, and he wants to get revenge.

&gt; ""It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan.""

This could easily be the motto for a cult like the Faceless Men.

&gt; Dont fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening, all at once. Live that way, and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that youve seen before

He is fighting at a mind game level, and also says everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, which couldn't be truer for a faceless man. You can be whoever you want to be, and portray yourself as an enemy, or a friend, and nobody will have a clue about your true motives or who is behind the mask.

---

The three eyed raven might be able to see what Littlefinger does on the mask, or what another face does, but it might be limited in seeing that the same person can wear many faces. If the three eyed raven can only see things, then it is limited to what is in front of it, which means even Bran could be fooled. Sure, he saw what Littlefinger might have done, and believed Littlefinger was there, but it's an illusion.

Littlefinger could have been the master fighter Syrio Forel who just vanished at a time when Littlefinger's chaotic ladder moves escalated, and yet Bran wouldn't even know because he is limited by what he can see, what is in front of him. The reason we didn't see Syrio actually die is because he didn't. Syrio was Littlefinger. He vanished, escaped, and then we saw him with his Littlefinger face on ever since.

The question is, if Littlefinger now wants to keep up the illusion that he's dead, who will he return as in the next season to keep up this illusion while continuing on with his manipulative games? What better way to scheme than to go full Machiavelli.",48,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The army of the dead is coming fast and Bran knows that more than anyone. It would make sense that the day he came back he should use his powers as the three eyed raven and try to work with blacksmiths to forge Valyrian Steel so they can mass produce it in Westeros. Yeah, it could be really expensive and hard or impossible to make but they should at least try. There are probably less than 10 known Valyrian Steel swords, so even doubling that would make the war a lot easier to fight. This could still happen in season 8, but it shouldve been his first priority as soon as he got back to Winterfell because it doesnt look like they have a lot of time.

Stannis offered the same, and pardons, citizenship, land, etc. except he also needed them to fight.  Except he specifically wanted Mance to bend the knee. Which Mance refuses to do.

However, if the original offer to Jon had been made and they were allowed south of the wall before Stannis showed up (or even if Stannis never showed up).  Did Mance expect to remain a separate king and the free folk to take land from others for themselves?  Or did he plan on his people becoming citizens of Westeros, and thus being subordinate to the Iron Throne?

My point is that either way, unless Mance Rayder wanted to seize land south of the wall and try to set up a separate kingdom, he would have had to acknowledge the ruler on the Iron Throne (or in other words, he'd have had to bend the knee, at least metaphorically if not physically as well).

And if that's true, why would he be willing to live in someone else's kingdom one minute but then when Stannis shows up he won't do it?

Sorry if it has been noted on here but does it confuse anyone the fact that in the actual show Mirri Maz Dur does not actually say anything to Dany about her not having another baby? I always assumed she did, as she says to Jon etc, but I am sure the scene goes something like

Dany ''When we he be as he was?

MMD'' When the son rises in the west and sets in the east...when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves''

But ''when your womb quickens again and you bare a living child'' I am pretty sure is only in the books.

Is this correct and are there any other examples of things which are referred to in the show but only fact from the books? Or is it over-editing/an oversight?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

As a serious fan of Game of Thrones and the Song Of Ice And Fire series I have found numerous houses that are far too amazing to get the ending that they have received. I love George RR Martin as much as the next Game of Thrones fan however there is a serious criticism that I must give.  
Houses that are uniquely cruel and are 100% Game of Thrones are some of the most squandered storylines in the entire series.  
My very favorite house that has been damaged the most  is House Bolton. The Boltons are uniquely cruel they are impressively power hungry and they are stuck in a limbo of uncertainty and Extinction. The Boltons have one of the most unique models and sigils in the entire series and yet they are treated as though they were just another villain that happened to stop by. The same could be said about numerous other houses that are much more popular and bigger than the Boltons. Such as the Starks and the Lannisters. These houses have not so much been harmed by outside forces but have been harmed by either too much ambition or too little ambition. Similar things could be said about the Baratheons and the Tyrells.  
However this post is about houses that are mostly hated. houses like the Boltons, like the Lannisters and in my case like the Targaryens.  
I think it's about time that we as fans finally put aside the idea that we can only focus on houses that we enjoy. I think it's time that we look at the more hated and awful houses in the series not only for inspiration but for admiration as well.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Second, sort of hopes someone proves me wrong. 

In season 6 and 7 the build up of two great and good houses has been shown. Targaryen and Stark. These two houses has been portrayed as the ones who will save the realm and make it prosper, but GRRM has said himself that he dont likes good endings where the hero(es) wins and everyone lives happily ever after. 

The Hidden Rise of Petyr Littlefinger Baelish.
Littlefinger told Sansa that he likes to play a game. A game where imagines what is the wors thing someone will do to him. When Bran quoted Littlefinger, he knew he was in trouble. 
In of the episodes before Sansa asked Littlefinger if he knew what the Faceless men were, and he answered only by reputation. We all know that is a lie, because someone who cheats death and can look like others is of interest to a person who have had an eye on the throne. 
So in one of the episodes in S7 we see him talking to a woman in Winterfell and gives her a coin. Probably a Coin of Bravos. Then on the trial, there are TWO options in which he escaped.

Option one: He learned from Jaqen Hgaar and faked his death. We have seen Arya kill Jaqen Hgaar and the she proceeds to take of his many faces. He then appears live and well. Littlefinger may have done the same.

Option two: The lady who was given a coin from Littlefinger in Winterfell copied his face and took his place on the trial. You may be wondering: but you can only use the face to a dead person. WRONG. In the same episode where Arya kills Jaqen Hgaar, she pulls of his many faces and stares at her own face and then Jaqen Hgaar appears. So we know some of the higher ranks of the Faceless can use faces to the living. 

If one of the two options is correct or a third option will be put to use, how will he succeed?
Littlefinger have been in the game for quite some time. So he knows how dangerous sitting on the iron throne really is, and he cant defeat all those massive armies. He will wait for everyone else to fight and he will corrupt the winner from the shadows. He will then continue to play the game and rule the kingdoms from the shadows, and everyone and everything will then be puppets to Littlefinger and rule in his own way. 

Doesnt seem so farfetched, right?",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

On 2 separate occasions Varys traded words with priestesses of R'hllor. The first time was with Kinvara and she asked him ""Should I tell you what the voice said? Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?""   


The second time was with Melisandre at Dragonstone and she said ""I have to die in this strange country, just like you.""

So my theory is Varys knows exactly what the voice from the fire said. I think it revealed his death to him or told him how he is going to die, hence why he seemed so shocked to find out Melisandre knew what it said. That could be the main reason for his hate of magic.

Its the worst nightmare Ive had to date.

I was so perplexed with how poorly the 2-chapter ending was written. I couldnt understand why GRRM would ever write it like that, as if any of us cares who rules over sticks and stones and puddles of mud.

And yet, GRRM chose to write it like that because (if I understand correctly what the hell my subconscious is trying to tell me) ASOIAF was based largely on history and every person whose life ever mattered in the War of Roses and the subsequent eras is dead and mostly forgotten now. Yes, we will continue to tell stories about them, in the same way that the people who will continue to inhabit those castles in Westeros (assuming the Whitewalkers wont kill them all eventually) will continue to pass on stories about the Targaryens and Lannisters and Starks and etc. But that is what we will all be in the end a page in some book, a name in some gravestone, a memory in some loved ones mind.

And also, if there ends up being any truth to it- I dont wanna be that person who says OMG THATS what I was thinking all along!  and not have any proof. And yes I know this is probably WAY far fetched and therefore this theory is mostly for entertainment value. 
Anyway- In the books, theres a lot of talk about warging, and skin-changing. Theres a line in which Varamir Six-Skins asks how can we even tell if the man is warged into the beast, or the beast is wearing the man- something to that extent. Theres also talk of other races with different colored eyes. Eye color is mentioned very frequently in the book series. We see Leaf shoving a dragon glass dagger into who we believe to be the first NK and turning him from human to White Walker. We dont see what happened before this. WHAT IF Leaf was really turning him BACK to his true form? What if he was WARGED into a human and was changed back to the NK (his true form) by Leaf against his will? What if all these people with weird colored eyes are some form of WW race that is living parasitically via  warging into humans? They talk about how Targs have violet eyes. Dont red and blue make purple? Could a blue-eyed WW have warged into a red-eyed Targaryen and caused their eyes to turn violet? Theres talk about how so many Targs are crazy. Old Nan mentions WWs hate anything with warm blood flowing through them. What if the WWs, as their bodies died, warged into the first Targs and went crazy after a while? Why are Targs associated with fire and heat? Is that what keeps the WWs inside them at bay?  They say the WWs were DEFEATED, but they never used the word killed. Just some thoughts.

Let me tell you before hand that I am not a Frey apologist, but rather a Stark fan. My goal here is to analyze the situation that led up to the Red Wedding a bit.

Walder Frey agreed to let Robb Stark cross the bridge when Robb's uncle Edmure was being besieged at Riverrun and needed urgent assistance. Walder Frey took advantage of the situation in a very sneaky way, thereby establishing one of his daughters as future Queen in the North.

When Walder Frey agreed to the deal, Renly Baratheon has already established himself in Highgarden, amassing a force of 100,000 men. Renly Baratheon was in a position that would have ensured a bloody war with the Lannister forces supporting Joffrey, thereby allowing the North and the Riverlands to split away from the Iron Throne. Walder Frey also knew that, considering Lysa Arryn was Robb's aunt, would either do nothing or take up arms for the Stark cause.

Joining Robb Stark was a safe bet at the time. When Balon Greyjoy started his invasion of the North (contrary to popular thought Theon was not the reason for this - at least in the books Balon was amassing a fleet for a long time already), and when Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell, confidence in Stark leadership in the North was shaken. Everybody knew that Robb had to deal with the Ironmen at some point, thereby exposing the Riverlands to further Lannister attacks.

When Renly was assassinated by the shadow, causing the Tyrells to defect to the Lannister side of the war, in turn causing Stannis to lose at the Blackwater, Robb Stark's fate was sealed. As Renly was dead and Stannis was militarily impotent post-Blackwater, Walder Frey had to expect a combined Lannister-Tyrell assault on the Riverlands. Robb Stark would have been busy fighting the Ironmen in the North, while this happened.

Walder Frey would have been beheaded as a traitor once the Riverlands fell to Lannister control.

**I think he did not have any other viable choice other than turning against Robb Stark.** The way he did it, first offering them bread and salt under his roof and thereby protection under guest right, and then killing them regardless, was highly dishonorable. No doubt about that, and I am not trying to justify that at all. I am merely saying that, in the mid-term, he would have turned against Robb Stark. And that leaves the following question: **Why didn't Robb Stark anticipate his betrayal, given the strategic situation of the war?** ",58,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A very good writing technique is letting the world develop around the characters and have the characters react to it with their own unique personality. The show writers did the opposite where they made the world work around the characters. What do I mean by this?  Dany convincing all the Dothraki to join her after killing their leaders and walking out of a flaming hut, from season 1, it was established that the Dothraki hated magic. Instead of doing that, they could have had Dany make an impressioned speech about Dothraki not accomplishing shit in the last few decades and how she plans to make men from the far west fear the Dothraki. Less flashy but it would make more sense.

Another problem is that all the characters have now become tropes instead of characters. This is related to my first point. Arya is now one of the most bad ass assassin. Dany is a good and fair Queen. Jon is the white washed protagonist that can't be faulted. Sansa is the girl who suffered but learned the art of deception and ruling. See, during the first few season of Game of Thrones, we didn't neccessarily think that about these characters, our opinions of the characters and their trop changed constantly in the first few seasons. But in the last few, it has been static.

The third problem is that the show writers try to make it so every ""good"" guy likes each other for the basis that they are on the same side. Dany is now a fair and good Queen so every good guy has to like her. I'll make a bet with someone but I bet you that when Sam Tarly meets Dany, he'll forgive her on the spot and say something like ""I understand you did what you had to do"". In reality, people hold grudges, If you kill someone's brother who is dear to someone, they will remember, and even though Sam didn't get along with his father there is some relation there. It's not about whether Dany did the right thing or not in the grand sceme of things, to Sam, she killed someone he cared for. Why I think Sam will just forgive Dany is because something similar has already happened. Dany forgiving Varys and instantly trusting him after Varys sent some assassins at her. Arya and Sansa having their whole spat in season 7 and then LF happened and it's like the whole fight between them never happened. Their dispute was actually interesting and made sense. The point I'm getting is, is that the show writers are trying to say ""You should like this character, and to convince you even more, look at all these other characters that like this character"". In Game of Thrones fashion, many characters should still have disputes, the history of westeros is littered with some person sleighting another and then for the other person to take bloody revenge.

Sorry, I know some of you are sick of the complaints about the last few seasons. But in reality, many people have become less invested in the show, even the critics gave the last few seasons a weaker score.  I still like the show but I didn't bother rewatching the last 4 seasons.",21,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This meant that the Show writers had nothing to work off of for the last few seasons which lead to a drop in quality unfortunately. I also believe if the show started in 2015 (or maybe 2016, 2017), the final book would have been finished by the time the writing for the final season comes up so the show would be wholely faithful to the books. Now we get a show that half adapts the books and the other half is finished off with the Show Writer's visions (albeit aided by George).

What happens when George finishes his book series? Would we ever get a faithful adaptation to the books? I really don't think so, not for at least 20 years. And then interest would have died down significantly and the show would be unfairly compared to the one we have now.

But all in all, it isn't all bad that the show started early. The show from it's timing to its masterful story telling has made it an international success. This drew a significant audience  to the series which probably made George want to expand on its history more. So now in addition to the main series we have a few books like A World Of Ice and Fire. I also think the huge increase in interest and led George to want to perfect The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring which probably explains the delay. So a positive to the show coming out is that the Books will have an overall better quality to them.",18,1,False,self,,,,,

Some months ago I finished watching game of thrones myself. And like much of you here can relate I've watched way to many GoT theory videos on youtube. Now in order to prepare her for the final season, I finally got my girlfriend to watch the show. And I've been watching with her with some of those theories in mind. However, while we were watching just a random scene in a random episode a few things hit me at once, and I'm very curious what you might think about this endgame theory on Varys.

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: only keep reading if you have seen everything from season 1-7

So I'm going to be assuming you as a reader are familiar with the most mean stream theories. Here is what I assume to be true: Tyrion is a Targaryen (Mad king raped his mother, Tywin knew) , Varys truly wants stability for the realm and the people, Jon is Aegon.

Now I would like to point out that Varys in the books talked about how he ""trained"" a perfect ruler. And to some people this seems to be either Jon, whom indeed is an amazing leader, or Danny, whom is growing stronger every day. But if Varys had the Iron Throne in store for Jon, where the hell was he, he never was around? Jon wanted some legitimacy and joined the wall for life, and nobody bothered to stop him. Strange.

And what about Danny? Varys left the capital in order to serve Danny better and supply her with advice(rs). However, when Robbert gave the order to kill the girl. Varys didn't object, he carried out the order, and when Ned called to cancel the assassination Varys didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. It was probably already done he said. Now it is possible that it was true at the time, as timelines don't have to be shown chronologically, however, it does raise some suspicion. What if it totally fitted Varys his agenda to have Danny killed, and he didn't mind at all? 

So I got thinking: what if, Tyrion is the one Varys has been grooming for the Iron Throne for the past 20 years? 

It makes perfect sense. Varys was around for Tyrion not for Danny and Jon. Jon was shipped off to the wall and Varys didn't bother. Danny was wanted dead, and Varys carried out the order. However, Varys was always there when Tyrion needed assistance, or aided him when he escaped death row. Also, Varys took Tyrion to Danny. He said in order to advice her. What if that was a lie, and he only brought him there to advice her so that Tyrion would get more experience at ruling? To get to know the lands of Essos? Tyrion is a smart and just man, totally fit for ruling. And I think Varys has more to do with that than Tywin did. 

To come back to the point earlier. Dannies claim to the throne is stronger. As she is a true born Targaryen. However, is Varys really the kind of guy to really care about that? Or does het just want to do what is good for the realm and put the best ruler on the throne? And if that is the case, how would he have reacted when Robert wanted her dead? The way he acted seems to perfectly fit this scenario.

Both Danny nor Jon never really have seen to get prepared to rule. However Tyrion has served as Hand of the King, Master of Coin, and has led men to battle. He understands diplomacy and is able to make the hard, selfsacrificing choices rulers need to make. It would be awesome if Varys was just preparing him, grooming him, only to reveal his true herritage only fter the usurpors are dethroned. Before that it would be too dangerous. 

Okay, I could go on for hours about how many things are consistent with this theory, but I'm curious what you guys think.  Is this plausible? Is this even a new theory (It is very possible I missed it, not as up to speed anymore nowadays) Do i miss some epic implications of this? Is there something that disproves all of this that I'm missing? I look forward to what you have to say!

Some main examples are changing Euron from a creepy guy that actually has an interesting and weird aura to Cerseis pet. Or how they have screwed up Tyrion by making him go from badass dwarf to dwarf that makes one liners every other minute.

However my biggest issue with ruining characters is Arthur Dayne. I hate the Tower of Joy scene because of what they did to him. They got rid of his legendary sword Morning and replaced it with two normal swords because a sword fight with 2 swords in the hand of one person is a hell of a lot cooler than one sword in the hands of a literal sword fighting god.

And Marcella kinda got sent off to some foreign city by herself as a little girl, and when she finally became comfortable with her future there, and had her first ever bonding moment with her real father, she gets poisoned for some petty revenge against her mom.

These two characters actually had potential in my opinion. I just think its kind of a shame that they had to die off the way they did, right as we were getting to know them. Theyve been around since episode 1, I know they were really little kids but this season they finally started getting their own personalities. Idk, I just wish we couldve seen a tommen-Marcella reunion, or that they were portrayed as well as the stark children.

Yes the Starks treated him well, but they and the other northerners always made comments that he wasnt part of the Stark family all throughout S1. (I always think of the scene where he saves Brans life and Robb gets mad at him for doing it, saying its not his family.) Then he went home and his real family basically despised him for existing. Not to mention he had his dick chopped off. I also felt like he redeemed himself by saving Bran and Rickon, saving Sansa, and (soon to be) saving his sister.

Season 4 - The perfect season of GoT, dont think theres any arguing here. From the opening scene with Ice being melted down (chills) to the final scene with Arya leaving Westeros (fucking CHILLS), its just the perfect balance of magic, politics, romance, and battles. Somehow I had completely forgotten how stunning The Watchers on the Wall is. Oberyn gives the best monologue of the show with his I will be your champion speech. Brienne vs The Hound is hands down my favorite combat scene. The Children is one of the shows strongest finales. Its just. so. good.

Season 3 - Similarly with season 4, I dont think this one has a single bad episode. Kissed by Fire and The Climb are two of the best mid-season episodes that GoT has ever done. Theres also Jaimes unlikely redemption arc and his chemistry with Brienne, Dany finally stops being boring and becomes the Breaker of Chains in the most epic of ways, and as this was the first season I watched live, I will never forget how I felt when the credits silently rolled after Catelyns neck is sliced open. No TV show had ever made me feel that way before.

Season 1 - I had forgotten how much detail the show used to have! The first season is a phenomenal adaptation of the first book, and the low budget feel is fun, especially now that GoT is the biggest show on the planet. Even when you know what happens, its still hard to comprehend that Ned doesnt find a way out, and the episodes leading up to Baelor still fill me with dread. Such an awesome introduction to a sprawling epic.

Season 5 - If you had asked me before my re watch what the worst season is, I wouldve said Season 5 without skipping a beat. Now Im convinced it doesnt deserve its bad reputation. Yes I know it has Dorne and lots of politicking which some might find tedious, but watching Cersei, Jon, and Dany all struggle with their newfound power, and ultimately fail, is interesting as hell. I was captivated this time around. Hardhome is, without a doubt, my favorite episode of GoT. I remember where I was, who I was with, and how it made me feel when I first saw it, and it still gives me goosebumps. Not only because of the battle, but TYRION AND DANY. TOGETHER. TALKING. That was so damn exciting. Also Season 5 feels like the last classic season of Thrones, before the show completely changes.

Season 2 - Tyrion scheming in Kings Landing and Arya as Tywins cupbearer are two of my favorite plot lines of the entire series. Dany fucking around in Qarth and Jon fucking around beyond the wall? Not so much. But this season has Blackwater so its forgiven.

Season 7 - Sometimes I just wanted to yell at my screen Goddamn slow DOWN. My major complaint for the latest season is the pacing, but there is some legitimately cool shit. Dany finally using Drogon and the Dothraki against a Westerosi army is breathtaking, and seeing her standing on the Wall is bizarre and so much fun, as is Olennas boss exit and the Dragon Pit meeting. But it seems as if a lot of the shows own logic was thrown out of the window, especially the Beyond the Wall fiasco, Arya vs Sansa plot, and the forced Jon/Dany romance (cringe).

Season 6 - This is probably super controversial but I think Season 6 is straight up bad. Similarly to Season 5, if you had asked me before my rewatch I wouldve placed this one as my 2nd or 3rd favorite. The Winds of Winter and Battle of the Bastards were clouding my judgement, the rest of the season was actually difficult for me to rewatch. The Greyjoys, the High Sparrow, Aryas nonsensical Braavos plot, Sansa and Jon on their Northern tourits a slog, and a bit of a mess. That finale thoughnow thats good TV.

Why has he been waiting so long? He needed to get past the Wall, and the only thing to get him past is a dragon. A dead dragon. So he needed to wait for (big, proper) dragons to come back, then get one to come north. How? He creates a scary army, mopes around for a bit knocking people off, but conveniently leaves enough people alive after seeing his big army to spread the news. Then Dany arrives with her dragons, bingo, Winter Olympic javelin champ gets his escape plan lizard.

Now he's burnt (?) his way through the Wall he needs to hold the north so he can get to the isle of faces, bringing his army with him.

This is an additional post to my one about King Bran.  In addition to the weird skewed betting odds in Bran's favor that make no sense, it is odd that Sansa is so far down in the betting odds.  Sansa's whole arc is based on learning to rule so it makes sense that she would end up as a ruler - as Queen Elizabeth I.  Just based on her arc and where the books/ show are taking her, I'd say that she is the #2 most likely of the non-Targaryens to end up ruling Westeros.  (Oh and this has nothing to do with shipping.

Highest score wins some Reddit Coins and premium for a month or something. Maybe second and third get prizes too.

I'm not sure how exactly but hopefully the mods could restrict people from posting multiple entries. This way it would prevent cheating, though if people use alts that might be hard.

\- Gods: This may not seem relevant, but it annoys me a little. Which God/religion is the real one? How come Both the Lord of Light be real (judging by the 'visions' in the flames, the blood magic, the rebirth of Beric and Jon etc..) as well as the Many-faced God (Jaqen H'ghar and the house of black and white along with the faceless men), as well as the Drowned God (Euron's 'baptism' where he drowned and came back to life).

\- Is Jaqen H'ghar the Many-Faced God or what? And why did he let Arya live instead of killing her while she was wounded and holding Needle against his chest? Why did he let her get away with it?

\- What's up with Qyburn and how the hell did he actually manage to 'zombify' and enhance the Mountain? Is he secretly serving a God? The Lord of Light or something? Im not sure why no one seems to be giving that attention, if he can wake up the dead and make them stronger than before, shouldn't that be talked about more?

\- When the Three-Eyed Raven told Bran that 'it was time for him to learn everything', why did he show him how Hodor became a 'half-wit'? Is there something important that i'm missing?

\- Why does everyone seem to be scared of Milk of the Poppy? Sounds stupid, but Jaime refused to drink it when he was getting his hand fixed, he prefered to yell out and endure the pain rather than drink a numbing drink? And Arya also hesitated to drink it when she was being treated by Lady Crane..

\- Benjen 'explained' how he was saved at 1:20 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkArs3vL8oU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkArs3vL8oU) he says that a white walker stabbed him in the guts and he was 'left to turn' ... and was saved by having dragonglass plunged in his heart? The fuck? First of all, if he was still considered a human, both these wounds would've killed him, and if he was turning (and judging by his looks, he already has turned for 40%), wouldn't the dragonglass shatter him as well, since it shatters white walkers?

\- Follow-up on Benjen, how the fuck did he get a flaming mace? Isn't that only reserved for people who follow the Lord of Light?

\- What the fuck did Podrick do to those whores?

I have more questions, but i'll leave it at this for now.

What's everyone's season rankings?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/akyxio/spoilers_just_finished_my_rewatch_in_preparation/,McConnells_Neck,1548759457,"Seasons from favorite to least favorite:

Season 4 - The perfect season of GoT, dont think theres any arguing here. From the opening scene with Ice being melted down (chills) to the final scene with Arya leaving Westeros (fucking CHILLS), its just the perfect balance of magic, politics, romance, and battles. Somehow I had completely forgotten how stunning The Watchers on the Wall is. Oberyn gives the best monologue of the show with his I will be your champion speech. Brienne vs The Hound is hands down my favorite combat scene. The Children is one of the shows strongest finales. Its just. so. good.

Season 3 - Similarly with season 4, I dont think this one has a single bad episode. Kissed by Fire and The Climb are two of the best mid-season episodes that GoT has ever done. Theres also Jaimes unlikely redemption arc and his chemistry with Brienne, Dany finally stops being boring and becomes the Breaker of Chains in the most epic of ways, and as this was the first season I watched live, I will never forget how I felt when the credits silently rolled after Catelyns neck is sliced open. No TV show had ever made me feel that way before.

Season 1 - I had forgotten how much detail the show used to have! The first season is a phenomenal adaptation of the first book, and the low budget feel is fun, especially now that GoT is the biggest show on the planet. Even when you know what happens, its still hard to comprehend that Ned doesnt find a way out, and the episodes leading up to Baelor still fill me with dread. Such an awesome introduction to a sprawling epic.

Season 5 - If you had asked me before my re watch what the worst season is, I wouldve said Season 5 without skipping a beat. Now Im convinced it doesnt deserve its bad reputation. Yes I know it has Dorne and lots of politicking which some might find tedious, but watching Cersei, Jon, and Dany all struggle with their newfound power, and ultimately fail, is interesting as hell. I was captivated this time around. Hardhome is, without a doubt, my favorite episode of GoT. I remember where I was, who I was with, and how it made me feel when I first saw it, and it still gives me goosebumps. Not only because of the battle, but TYRION AND DANY. TOGETHER. TALKING. That was so damn exciting. Also Season 5 feels like the last classic season of Thrones, before the show completely changes.

Season 2 - Tyrion scheming in Kings Landing and Arya as Tywins cupbearer are two of my favorite plot lines of the entire series. Dany fucking around in Qarth and Jon fucking around beyond the wall? Not so much. But this season has Blackwater so its forgiven.

Season 7 - Sometimes I just wanted to yell at my screen Goddamn slow DOWN. My major complaint for the latest season is the pacing, but there is some legitimately cool shit. Dany finally using Drogon and the Dothraki against a Westerosi army is breathtaking, and seeing her standing on the Wall is bizarre and so much fun, as is Olennas boss exit and the Dragon Pit meeting. But it seems as if a lot of the shows own logic was thrown out of the window, especially the Beyond the Wall fiasco, Arya vs Sansa plot, and the forced Jon/Dany romance (cringe).

Season 6 - This is probably super controversial but I think Season 6 is straight up bad. Similarly to Season 5, if you had asked me before my rewatch I wouldve placed this one as my 2nd or 3rd favorite. The Winds of Winter and Battle of the Bastards were clouding my judgement, the rest of the season was actually difficult for me to rewatch. The Greyjoys, the High Sparrow, Aryas nonsensical Braavos plot, Sansa and Jon on their Northern tourits a slog, and a bit of a mess. That finale thoughnow thats good TV.

It was on a peace of paper and it was with the names of all alive characters and there were 3 columns , Who will die who will live and who will become a White Walker.

Every correct answer gives you 1 point and every incorrect takes one.

It was with points and there were 3 bonus questions with more points, for example who will kill the White King and who will sit on the throne a the end.

The bet is 10$ and the guy with most points wins the pot.

Thanks guys!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I dont think we value the importance of this Viserys Targaryen'scharacter in the showand we never really talk about him.He was a man who had lived all his life in exile with his baby sister in a strange land with no wealth and way to get home so he had to beg and do anything in order to keep him and Daenerys alive.

Viseryshad, in a way,lost a lot more than Daenerys had as hewas only one of the two that had actually experienced the Targaryen rule in Westeros, surrounded bywealth and family but that was taken from him at such a young age, his mother dies and he is responsible for not only looking after himself in a strange land where the Targaryen name could get him killed but also in charge of looking after his baby sister.



 It is no wonder that Viserys is depicted as this mad, delusional character butI believe that it is not justthetypicalTargaryen Madness that the house in knownfor but rather the nature ofhis upbringing had developedhis character.Throughout his years in exile he grows up with this nostalgic view of Westeros which he passes onto Daenerys and it seems unhealthy in its own way to be looking back on these memories from a childs perspective who loved his father and possibly didnt realise the truth of his fathers personality but of a son looking up to his father and developing this idea that if he returns home as king the life he had before will return and he will be happy.



When thinking back onit, Viserys didnt have to look after Daenerys and it probably would have been easier for him to survive and live in Essos if he didnt have to look after his sister but he did it anyway and sold his mothers crown in desperation only to be ridiculed for it.

When watching the show I could see obvious parallels between Daenerys and Viserys and the idea that if Daenerys did not have her dragons and her friends she would have became like Viserys. For example in Season 2 of the show when Daenerys comes to Qarth she is only gains power and access through her dragons and she knows this, during the meeting of her and the Master of Spices she reacts in a way that is similar to Viserys. She depends on her dragons at the start to get her where she is but Viserys never had that and he did not truly have any supporters to get him where he was.

I just want to take a minute to appreciate George R.R Martins amazing work throughout and how subtle and amazing all his characters are and also to praise the show and Harry Lloyds portrayal of the character even if he was not in the show for long.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here, I applied the Edgic technique (a portmanteau of Editing and Logic) to GoT to see who has the best chance of ""winning"" the Game of Thrones and sitting on the Iron Throne.

For those of you unfamiliar with how Edgic works, here is a link to an explanation (spoilers for Survivor Season 31):

[http://insidesurvivor.com/survivor-edgic-an-introduction-3094](http://insidesurvivor.com/survivor-edgic-an-introduction-3094)

NOTE: I only included contenders who 'played the game', have some sort of title/claim (Shireen, Mance, Gendry), or were major antagonists towards the end (Ramsay, High Sparrow, Night King)  


https://i.redd.it/kldg5cwfxdd21.png

\-**Ned**: Ned is the Classic CP second boot. I mean we all thought he was the protagonist and was going to ""win"", but his death set the stage for the ""anyone can die"" mentality.

\-**Robb** and **Catelyn**: Both were huge contenders, and with Ned dying you feel like they are destined to rule and avenge his death, so their deaths both come as a huge shock. CP premerge boots.

\-**Joffrey:** If he isn't OTTN, then I don't know who is.

\-**Stannis**: Semi-obvious he wasn't the winner due to his INV 'premiere' (season one), but towards S3/4 you feel as though he has the potential to be a huge endgame player. All of that is discarded after he burns his daughter alive.

**-Margaery:** A great player, whose game is often hidden from the audience. I didn't want to call her MOR because she was getting content, but her game was quite subtle. A lack of insight into the Tyrell house's POV, as well as an INV Season 1 made her downfall eminent.

\-**Littlefinger**: A great ""player"", but I only truly felt Littlefinger could 'win' during S4, when it was revealed that he set the War in motion, and when he took control of the Vale. However, a lack of insight into his 'master plan', as well as his failures with Sansa meant that I couldn't rank him as a contender.

\-**Varys**: Similar to Littlefinger, but apart from siding with Daenerys, we don't have that much on Varys as a player, leaving him teetering between CP and MOR.

\-**Gendry**: His bloodline gives him potential to win, however his three consecutive INV seasons basically mean that he has no chance of sitting on the Iron Throne.

**-Night King**: Undoubtedly a HUGE player in the game, however his Negative edit makes it apparent that he won't sit on the Iron Throne at the end (especially bc he isn't human).

\-**Theon Greyjoy:** Unfortunately, his content was a little lacking in  every season except 2, therefore he stands no chance of sitting on the Iron Throne, despite being present from the start.

\-**Tyrion**: Excellent first few seasons, however, his recent status as a mere player in Daenery's story arc makes me question whether or not he would end up on the throne.

\-**Jaime**: Started off with no chance, however S3 was the closest we had to Jaime having potential to sit on the Iron Throne, with his loss of his hand leading to growth, however his actions in S5-6 slices his chances. Although his desertion of Cersei at the end of S7 makes his role in the endgame apparent, I don't think he will sit on the Iron Throne himself.

\-**Cersei**: Started the game with no chance at all as the power-hungry, Machiavellian tyrant. However, the actions of the Faith Militant in S5-6 made us root for Cersei, and her actions in the S6 Finale, certainly give her kudos as a winner pick. However, her portrayal as the ultimate villain in S7 effectively rules her out of winning, especially as she is the woman who holds onto the Iron Throne currently.

\-**Bran**: Started off with a chance of winning, however his INV S5, and lack of a tone/emotions after becoming the Three Eyed Raven indicate that whilst Bran will have a major role in the endgame, he won't sit upon the Iron Throne.

\-**Arya**: Like her brother, started the show off with a HUGE chance of sitting on the Iron Throne. Her struggles throughout S2-4 made her a fan favourite, and a character people wanted to succeed. However, her Faceless Man training, and weirdness in S7, indicate that her story is going in a different direction, and that she probably won't sit atop the Iron Throne.

\-**Sansa:** I know people are going to protest me putting her as a contender. Yes her S1-2 made her come off as bratty, her emotional and political growth during S3-6 makes me think of her as a serious contender for the throne, especially with all of Ned's other children being less likely (in my opinion). After her actions in the S7 Finale, I feel that she is the Dark Horse to sit on the Iron Throne.

**The Final Two Contenders:**

\-**Daenerys**: There was no reason to give her content until S5 unless Daenerys was the winner for the Iron Throne. She has received an immense growth edit, and her sitting atop the Iron Throne would be a ""fairytale ending.""

**-Jon**: However, I feel as though Jon has a much higher chance of sitting on the Iron Throne, as he has the better claim to the throne (by blood), and his edit was more deceptive in a series filled with twists. Whilst both Jon and Daenerys began the show physically removed from the rest of the cast, Daenerys was still playing the political game (albeit in Essos), whilst Jon was being the hero. Moreover, Jon was killed and came back to life. Why would he have been brought back unless he was going to end up ruling Westeros? Additionally, being the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, Jon is LITERALLY the 'Song of Ice and Fire' (the name of the book series), and ties the White Walker and Political plot lines together. Ultimately, Jon winning the ""Game of Thrones"" both subverts the classic fairytale ending that Daenerys's win would entail, whilst fulfilling the fantasy trope of the ""Hidden Prince.""

True, some of the ones I wound up including, I don't honestly see having much of a shot doing even one round (like Theon &amp; Yara is a pairing, for ex), but it was enough that I did start to wonder if it COULD indeed be done with 62 pairings out to start with. After all even the real MM has at least a few teams that pretty much nobody in the house has faith will last past one game.

&amp;#x200B;

I am admittedly not a super Reddit-savvy person (probably even more so reddit/Thrones-savvy) and figured if this WAS given a proper go that I may very well need a good amount of input from others if not even direct involvement with one or more of the official higher ups on here, so it'd be best to just for now make a regular discussion post for this, not bother to try and do it all already. It would be even more work than I've already done if it seems like barely anybody would be into doing it (although it was kinda fun coming up with that original master list).

I believe he first forged his sword in water in the beheading of Janos Slynt who was Lord of Harrenhal in the Riverlands (water).

I think Jaimie will be captured and Jon will be duty bound to put him to death (I'm sure Danaerys will help convince him) thus slaying the captured lion.

I then think that he will be duty bound to put Danaerys to death as maybe she commits a treasonous act in a struggle for power, maybe. Possibly killing her after child birth since she is dying and suffering. The show does seem to  be pointing to her being pregnant.

In all cases, he passes the sentence and swings the sword as is his duty.

Daenerys will be killed in that major fight at the Isle of Faces/King's landing. Jon will use the same technique as Children used on Benjen and will stab her through her heart with a piece of dragonglass. This will revive her and she will leave far north with NK to become the Night Queen and give birth to her and Jon's baby (prince/princess) which will one day become the next Night King.

I have a lot of questions that are hard to describe so bear with me if it seems scattered. 

What was Rhllors end goal with Stannis? Clearly Melisandre believes he is the prince who was promised, and Rhllor even creates the demon thing to kill Renley. So was Stannis rise to power/fall planned by Rhllor, did Rhllor himself make a mistake, or was the entire situation misinterpreted by Melisandre? 

Also, slightly related, but in S1 Melisandre whispers to Davoss son that death by fire is the purest of all leading me to believe that she foresaw his death by wildfire. Did she know Stannis would lose at Blackwater? She seemed upset when telling Davos she made a mistake with Shireen but that comment made it seem like she had always foreseen Stanniss loss. 

Lastly, was Rhllors entire plan to bring attention to the white walkers? Is he against the white walkers even though he is technically evil? It seemed like he got rid of all the pointless fighting before showing the Great War in the flames to Melisandre, Beric, Hound, etc. 

Sorry I know its a lot but I dont see many conversations about Rhllor and I feel like religion and death by fire plays a huge part in this whole series so I was curious about others thoughts. I know its supposed to be mysterious but Id love to hear theories. Feel free to only answer partially as I know I asked like 10 questions in one post lol. ",26,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tonight I was listening to Tyrions chapter when he is involved in the battle against the Stark force's at the Trident. I found the description interesting. Most of the descriptive words used were reminding me of other characters in the book. It's almost as thought you could picture another battle happening. 
 
  Then I started thinking about the other battle he was involved in at Kings Landing. I haven't had an opportunity to review this chapter yet but it did get me thinking. Most people agree that there will be 2 battles in the final season. What if Tyrions previous battles are the key?

I remember the first time watching GoT I saw a specific quote. I think it was in the dialogue between Benjen and Jon, but now I'm not so sure, as I have been trying forever to find the scene and rewatch it, with no luck.

The dialogue was something like this, Jon tries to talk Benjen into letting him join the Night's watch, and at some point Benjen says:

""What do you think it takes (or what do you think you have to have) in order to be fit for the Night's watch (or what do you need so that you can survive out there), fire or ice?""

And jon answers ""ice""

""You need BOTH boy!""

I thought Benjen was the one that said that quote, but at this point I may be wrong and someone else told that to Jon.

I was really impressed by that, as it is one of the earliest mentions about both ice and fire needed to succeed, and found it really powerful. 
BUT, i cannot find it!
Does this remind you of something? 
Can you help me find that scene?

I have seen many theories by fans regarding whether Jon is also a human dragon. I think he is after his resurrection, and here is WHY:

""Two kings to wake a dragon. The father, and then the son, so they both die kings.""

Melisandre has been trying to (mistakenly) wake (actual) dragons by trying to use/sacrifice (in both books and show) a child of Robert. But both Edric Storm (in the books) and Gendry (in the show) are BASTARDS. Their father's death does not make them kings and THAT is the main part of the prophecy. It takes TWO KINGS. 

 Both Melisandre and fans have been too obsessed with the ""father and son"" bit and lost the crucial ""both die kings"" bit. I have seen theories about Jon's grandfather and uncle's deaths on his mother's side counting for it, but no, they were no official kings, even though their ancestors were. 

The show might have messed this up a bit with Daenaerys for one and her 'human dragon' abilities of resisting fire. The show kinda hints at it from the beginning. But there's no indication of it in the books. I believe she became/'woke' as a dragon by the ritual of the priestess only following the deaths of Drogo and his son, thus 'king' and 'heir' (I have seen it being argumented that Drogo died after Rhaego but Drogo WAS dead; the witch just brought him back as a spiritless carcass, he wasn't truly alive anymore). And so she was 'woken'.

In Jon's case, yes, Rhaegar's and Aerys' deaths don't count for it, bc Rhaegar died a prince. BUT-

I don't know what the show did with that, bc I didn't watch that season, but in the books, before going to the Twins, Robb's wife was not pregnant (tho I know she was in the show so they messed shit up again) and he thought all his other siblings were dead. He was worried about not having an heir. And so he called a meeting. And he made everyone sign an official document that, in the event of his death with no children, Jon would be released of his vow, legitimatised and declared king/his righteous heir. Bc Robb was a king, he COULD do that, yes. Maester Aemon would've been freed of his vow before him and become king had he accepted it.

Of course, shit went downhill after the Red Wedding. BUT, by all official matters, Jon was made heir of the North throne\ presumed king by law. But THEN he died, too. Thus, Robb/the king and his heir/presumed king died, both technically dying kings. A ritual would then ""awaken"" Jon, also of Targaryen blood, so also capable of being a woken dragon.

""Two kings to wake a dragon"". The explanation why Daenaerys has her powers of all Targaryens, and possible proof that Jon will be another 'dragon'.

(Also this being a Targaryen thing bc of their connection with dragons might explain so many Targaryens' obsession with it. It has been possible for them before, as well, but at great costs.)",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Her reactions to those plot-twists, deaths, epic, heroic goose bump inducing moments so far have been entertaining to me, worth sitting for hours and re-watching the movies again just for it.

I reckon Game of Thrones will surprise her the most, considering she hates deaths and always expects that plot armor will save main characters, and just how likable most of the characters are.

We don't have a lot of time together and watching every single episode with her will take ages, and we would like to watch the last season together. So my idea is that she watches most of them by herself and we only watch a few of it together, like season finales, maybe a random episode to occasionally throw her off.

I've got a guess.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aledwb/spoilers_meera_reed_done_with_or_is_there_a_plan/,NoDayneNoGain,1548865739,"When Meera left Bran it never sat right with me, not due to the rudeness of the three eyed ravBran but instead at how it didn't really make sense. Meera and Jojen went north on their fathers wishes and they went to find Bran. They knew that Bran was the key to winning the war as Jojen had stated. She out of every living person knows that Bran must survive for the Long Night to be won yet she decides to leave the crippled boy with family he hasn't seen in years and other dodgy characters around. He is the true born heir to Winterfell and if someone wanted him out of the picture, which they well could, he's an easy target. But Meera left and her excuse: 

** I don't want to leave you, but when-- when they come, I need to be with my family.
And you're safe.**

I have been thinking about it recently and here are my thoughts. Go back to the first tower of Joy scene and we see Bloodraven introducing Bran to who is there. He clearly says out loud that Howland Reed is Meera's father, something that you'd think Bran would know already. But I am starting to think that Bloodraven wasn't speaking to Bran but to the audience. So the audience, well casual viewers are reminded about Meera's father and then they know that Meera is with her family. Meera is with Howland and if you are like me and think we haven't seen the end of her then it will be *Meera bringing Howland into the mix** 

**Why**

That's the question. What part does Howland play. Well he was there when Jon was born so he is the last living person who knows but is that his role? Will an old Crannogman's opinion be enough to convince everyone that Jon is Targaryen. Maybe he will just reveal to Jon, but why? Sam and Bran can do that fine. Well realistically I think that could be his role in the show but I had another thought, I dawned the tin foil: 

**DAWN - He will bring Dawn to the North as Dawn is Lightbringer**

Now IF Lightbringer is to appear, I don't even really think that it will to be honest but IF it is then it can't be a Valyrian steel sword. We know that Lightbringer was forged 8000 years ago in Westeros, long before the Valyrians had any influence in Westeros, maybe Lightbringer was crafted into Valyrian Steel eventually or maybe Dawn, the sword that is different than all others and just as sharp as Valyrian Steel. 

The book says a member of House Dayne followed a falling Star and Dawn came from it and then Ned left it to Ashara Dayne. There is no mention of that in the show so there is some license here to work with. Howland killing Arthur Dayne was strange and didn't make any real difference to the story, unless of course Ned gives the sword to Howland because it was Howland who killed Dayne and not Ned and since then Howland has had the sword and will be shown the importance of it. 

**Disclaimer**

I am not even a big follower of Lightbringer being in the show, I know this theory isn't flawless and it's more brainstorming from me than anything else but I am convinced that Meera will return, I think the mention of her family and Howland will mean that he will be in the next series for sure and I know that there is a good chance it's just to reveal to Jon in the books at least I think he will be the one to reveal. But with the reveal already covered by Sam and Bran there must be more to Howland Reed's potential appearance than that. 

A point was made of showing Dawn on the screen and it hasn't been revisited yet, I think that Howland Reed could have the sword or even more than that knows where it is **cough cough** Crypts of Winterfell **cough cough** sorry I had something in my throat there.

I haven't seen much trying to predict their deaths but I think they are going to fight and ultimately kill each other.  How?  A repeat of history where Jon and the Night King are fighting on dragons, but at some point the two collide.  Jon leaps off of Rhaegal onto Viserion, stabbing the Night King.   After the collision Rhaegal and Jon fall to their deaths.  Dany and Drogon are unable to help Jon and Rhaegal because (insert D&amp;D reason here).  This will mirror the events from the [Battle Above the Gods Eye](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_Above_the_Gods_Eye).   Maybe this actually occurs over the Gods Eye since we see the ice and fire meet there in the first trailer we got this year (I think it's called Dragnstone).

&amp;#x200B;

I think this could be visually stunning and emotional for the audience.  Imagine watching Jon leaping in air and as he kills the Night King and an ice explosion occurs.  Grounded characters see wights and wight walkers collapse/die but then  they look up and see Jon and Rhaegal falling out of the sky.  Each character would have their own reaction to this as the camera sweeps across the survivors.  Picture Arya and Davos sprinting towards Jon, while Sansa and Dany just cover their mouths in shock.  The last image we have of Jon is him closing his eyes just before he hits the ground, accepting his death.  Dany cannot save Jon, that would be too cheesy and would go against what GoT is supposed to be.  Emotionally as the audience we will (most of us) be happy as the Night King dies, but then we realize that the hero is making the ultimate sacrifice. Thus a bitter-sweet ending to the war against death. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Jon and Night King kill each other by events like the link above.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have seen many theories by fans regarding whether Jon is also a human dragon. I think he is after his resurrection, and here is WHY:

""Two kings to wake a dragon. The father, and then the son, so they both die kings.""

Melisandre has been trying to (mistakenly) wake (actual) dragons by trying to use/sacrifice (in both books and show) a child of Robert. But both Edric Storm (in the books) and Gendry (in the show) are BASTARDS. Their father's death does not make them kings and THAT is the main part of the prophecy. It takes TWO KINGS. 

 Both Melisandre and fans have been too obsessed with the ""father and son"" bit and lost the crucial ""both die kings"" bit. I have seen theories about Jon's grandfather and uncle's deaths on his mother's side counting for it, but no, they were no official kings, even though their ancestors were. 

The show might have messed this up a bit with Daenaerys for one and her 'human dragon' abilities of resisting fire. The show kinda hints at it from the beginning. But there's no indication of it in the books. I believe she became/'woke' as a dragon by the ritual of the priestess only following the deaths of Drogo and his son, thus 'king' and 'heir' (I have seen it being argumented that Drogo died after Rhaego but Drogo WAS dead; the witch just brought him back as a spiritless carcass, he wasn't truly alive anymore). And so she was 'woken'.

In Jon's case, yes, Rhaegar's and Aerys' deaths don't count for it, bc Rhaegar died a prince. BUT-

I don't know what the show did with that, bc I didn't watch that season, but in the books, before going to the Twins, Robb's wife was not pregnant (tho I know she was in the show so they messed shit up again) and he thought all his other siblings were dead. He was worried about not having an heir. And so he called a meeting. And he made everyone sign an official document that, in the event of his death with no children, Jon would be released of his vow, legitimatised and declared king/his righteous heir. Bc Robb was a king, he COULD do that, yes. Maester Aemon would've been freed of his vow before him and become king had he accepted it.

Of course, shit went downhill after the Red Wedding. BUT, by all official matters, Jon was made heir of the North throne\ presumed king by law. But THEN he died, too. Thus, Robb/the king and his heir/presumed king died, both technically dying kings. A ritual would then ""awaken"" Jon, also of Targaryen blood, so also capable of being a woken dragon.

""Two kings to wake a dragon"". The explanation why Daenaerys has her powers of all Targaryens, and possible proof that Jon will be another 'dragon'.

(Also this being a Targaryen thing bc of their connection with dragons might explain so many Targaryens' obsession with it. It has been possible for them before, as well, but at great costs.)",23,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I don't usually post here but I wanted to share this little thing to you.

So, I reread AGOT (I felt nostalgic with the last season coming) and this is how I imagine Daenerys at the beginning of the book. 

It was supposed to be a light and shadow study but this is what happened. I transformed it into a portrait.

However, we now know that John Snow is the  legitimate son of Rhaegar which would have bumped him up in the line of succession before Viserys and Daenerys, but Rhaegar and his other children died before John was born.  

So the question is, who has a better claim to the throne, John or Dany?  If Westeros if following british rules, would an unborn child trump a younger sibling?

**JON SNOW AND SANSA STARK MARRIAGE**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will be the final King and Queen of the 7 Kingdoms. Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books. 

&amp;nbsp;
____________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;**

&amp;nbsp;


Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansas engagement  to Joffrey Baratheon.  Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books. 

BTW, dont be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance. 

&amp;nbsp;
___________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.

&amp;nbsp;

__________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. Thats why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jons bastard daughter. 

Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard.  The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love. 

*The things we do for love* will still be the theme of the story in the end.

&amp;nbsp;

____________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**THIS IS A STORY OF FATHERS DAUGHTERS.**

&amp;nbsp;


A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; its a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about fathers daughters. 

And thats exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their fathers daughters. Thats why the show gave so much importance on those characters fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.

No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story. 

&amp;nbsp;
_______________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Arya:  We both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. **You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle.** Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.

&gt;(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)

&amp;nbsp;


**AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS.**

Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.

&amp;nbsp;

**SANSA STARK WILL BE THE QUEEN;**

&amp;nbsp;

Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa its the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.

Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen. 


All Sansas dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that life is a song. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;**

&amp;nbsp;

Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!**

&amp;nbsp;


Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. 
They will write songs about her for years and years to come

&amp;nbsp;

___________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD**

&amp;nbsp;

I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, dont be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same. 

Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Bran: What else have you seen it?
&gt;Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. **YOU**.

&gt;(Season 3 Episode 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat. 

&amp;nbsp;

______________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Jon Snow: They will see it you for **what you are**.

&gt;(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)

&amp;nbsp;

In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her fathers head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.

Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just dont know yet.

Daenerys could  never be the villain of her own story. Thats why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the  Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros. 


So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. Its a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power. 

Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, thats the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. Thats whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.


&amp;nbsp;


**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;**

&amp;nbsp;

By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. 
Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions.  Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. 
The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be  lying to themNo matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers.. 

Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers. **But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Daario Naharis: I pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them

&gt;(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)

&amp;nbsp;

Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Dont be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people. 

Jon and Daenerys  relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons. 

The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in  Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes. 

The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror.

**WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;**

&amp;nbsp;


Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror.  Daenerys will be the last dragon. 

&amp;nbsp;


**DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;**

&amp;nbsp;


I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for  Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy others peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;so comes snow, after fire and even dragons have their ending

**WE WILL HAVE A SECOND REBELLION AND A SECOND DANCE OF THE DRAGONS**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Don't fight in the North. Or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend... every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you, ..**everything that happens will be something that you have seen before.**
 
&gt;(Litllefinger SEASON 7 EPISODE 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Everything that happened in the past will happen again in season 8. Roberts Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Roberts Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Stannis: What are you reading?

&gt;Shireen: **""The Dance of Dragons.""**

&gt;Stannis: What's it about? It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. **Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.** By the time it was over, thousands were dead. **And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.**
 
&gt;(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)

&amp;nbsp;

We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever. 

Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.


&amp;nbsp;

**SANSAS PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI**

&amp;nbsp;


Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but dont be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;she (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, **but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!**
 
&gt;(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)

&amp;nbsp;


Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher This was the first foreshadowing of Sansas plans to cast down Cersei.

And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. **Fire cannot kill a dragon.**

&gt;(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)

&amp;nbsp;

Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenerys remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.

&gt;DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.

&gt;DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.

&amp;nbsp;


Remember that Brans first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kingss justice and Ned explains to him that the man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword. This is one of the most important themes in the story.

Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: **I know where we have to go**. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.

So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.

BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon. 



&amp;nbsp;
_______________________________________

**THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER**

&amp;nbsp;

No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.

&amp;nbsp;


**JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;** 

Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons. 

I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating  Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros; 

Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible. 

Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros. 


&amp;nbsp;


**TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;**

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion will have to face a trial for a third time and this time he will be guilty of his crimes. Yeah, that is not a prediction, its a spoiler, but I already expected that. George loves his 3. Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee. 

He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansas kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game. 

But I dont believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.


&amp;nbsp;


**CERSEI WILL DIE;**

&amp;nbsp;

There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think youre safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.

&gt;(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)

&amp;nbsp;


This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the little brother and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He lifted his head to look at her. ""Catelyn,"" he said. His voice was distant and formal. **""Where are the children?""**

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I

&amp;nbsp;

I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. Thats why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.


Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captains daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;

&amp;nbsp;

_________________________________
 
&amp;nbsp;

**A TIME FOR WOLVES;**

&amp;nbsp;


It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.

Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY..**

&amp;nbsp;


Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of ""A Dream of Spring"". 

&gt;**Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, whats the creative process there?**


&gt;Daniel: ""Ive spoken to George a lot in the process.  The biggest issues we have are continuity questions.  There are things about this story that only he knows, and they arent all obvious.  **There was one scene I had to rework because theres a particular line of dialog**  and you wouldnt know it to look at  **thats important in the last scene of A Dream of Spring.**-  Daniel Abraham

&amp;nbsp;

On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her. 

&gt;NED: She was my sister. **This is where she belongs.**

&amp;nbsp;
 
In the books, this conversation is different:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?"" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. ""She deserved more than darkness ""

&gt;**""She was a Stark of Winterfell,**"" Ned said quietly. **""This is her place.""**

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Eddard I

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and thats how he will reply:

&gt;She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs.

&amp;nbsp;

What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: 
First of all, Ladys death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.


&amp;nbsp;


&gt;When it was over, he said, Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at Winterfell.

&gt;All that way? Jory said, astonished.All that way, Ned affirmed. The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Eddard III

&amp;nbsp;

Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you. 

&gt;Jon: She told you? 

&gt;Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. Thats how I know. **She belongs in the North**. The real North. You understand me? 

&amp;nbsp;



Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. **Because thats where she belongs.**

I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya. 

Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK. 

And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband. 

&amp;nbsp;

Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. **One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the nights first watch.** Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. - 

&gt;AGOT Tyrion II

&amp;nbsp;

And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one. 









&amp;nbsp;

However, we now know that John Snow is the legitimate son of Rhaegar which would have bumped him up in the line of succession before Viserys and Daenerys, but Rhaegar and his other children died before John was born, so you could argue that when John was born the crown had already rightfully passed to Viserys and would then go to Daenerys before John or since that never happened John is in the next in line behind the Mad King.

So the question is, who has a better claim to the throne, John or Dany? If Westeros if following british rules, would an unborn child trump a younger sibling?

If Sansa had of just told the truth the lords of the Vale would have killed Baelish right then and there.

And I've been a little disappointed in the lack if fan theories based on the teaser.

So, here's my prediction for season 8 based on the trailer: 

The show will confirm a theory that The Great Other (the god of darkness, cold, evil, fear, and death) is imprisoned in Winterfell's crypts and that when the Starks left, the Others began raising an army of the dead so they could basically invade Winterfell and break The Great Other free. Whatever magic was used to imprison him basically dragged the Stark children all back to Winterfell. And here's where I'm a little more uncertain. 

We know there must always be a Stark in Winterfell and part of this theory about The Great Other's imprisonment is that Stark blood was used in a blood magic ritual to imprison him there. So, their presence will either re-strengthen whatever enchantments are binding him to Winterfell or the Starks were gone for too long and he will break free no matter what, but the Starks (and Daenerys and her dragons) are the only ones who stand a chance of trying to resist the Others when they invade Winterfell to break their god free.

The statues in the trailer make a lot of sense with this theory too. Some people are speculating that this scene doesn't happen in the show and others are saying it's a dream (which is entirely possible because there are lots of dreams about the crypts in the books). The only manifestation of his power that we've seen comes from the Others/White Walkers, so we don't really know what he can do. I have a hard time believing he would evoke fear in the Starks by showing them statues of themselves because it seems like he could do significantly more based off what we've seen the Others do, but the statues do represent death and they could make the Starks afraid because most people are afraid of death. The crypts are filled with icy air after they see their statue. Nevertheless, I'm not completely writing off that The Great Other is showing them these statues. At the very least, if this scene will occur in the show as a dream, it could definitely be interpreted as foreshadowing the release of The Great Other.

And we see basically everything The Great Other controls in the trailer. We see death (or, more accurately, a foreshadowing of death) which creates fear. We see icy air invade the dark crypts. I'm not sure the trailer directly shows us evil. But, when the ice fills the crypts, we know the dead come with it. Not only does it hint at the ""evilness"" of the Others, but it could also be like a meta foreshadowing of The Great Other's release. He is, after all, R'hollor's antithesis.

He calls her out in front of Jon. Its a very well acted scene. Id describe the scene itself as powerful. Id describe the emotions as raw. But I dont think its anywhere near as good as everyone has made it out to be.

Its rightfully the point in the story worth remembering because that whole sequence finally reaches its payoff from setting up Davos and Shireens relationship. But acting talents on this show (IMO) are best expressed in subtleties and buildups. Stannis slowly but steadily declines into unhinged madness. We see the journey of a resolute man doing whatever it takes to save the world and stake his claim. But each and every step of the way, Stephen Dillane delivers on this descent into the abyss. You can even see the rationalization seep out of his face as he sets his new course.

I just find those moments much more noteworthy of brilliant portrayals rather than the explosions of emotions and climaxes that are supplemented and amplified by their overall context.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

At some point post red wedding, once the Boltons had solidified their claim to winterfell and are now trying to consolidate loyalty from the other northern houses, Ramsay Bolton says that the Umbers, Manderlys, and Karstarks command more men than the rest of the northern houses combined. Now the Boltons, being the historic rivals of house Stark, would also be somewhere within this top 3, but this would still leaves the Karstarks at LEAST the fourth most powerful house in the North. Due to the lore in the books, it is known that the Karstarks are direct descendants from a member of the Starks family, Karlen Stark, who was given some land and his own keep, naming it Karhold and his family branch would come to be known as the Karstarks. This officially makes Lord Harrion Karstark, Lord of Karhold, at the point of the Red Wedding, the man in the whole of the Seven Kingdoms with the most Stark blood (Stark-iest, if you will) that isnt presumed dead/a sworn brother of the nights watch AND a bastard/essentially a prisoner in kings landing.

So because the Karstarks have a pretty big army as it is, and the best claim to the northern throne in the seven kingdoms (other than bran and Rickon, who are presumed dead), it would stand to reason that a substantial amount of northern houses would come to their aid in a possible northern civil war. Not that it would be much of a war anyways, as the Boltons may have some historical allies, they certainly cant fend off an army of, presumably, tens of thousands of northmen fighting for who they believe is there rightful leader. 

The north remembers they say, and I dont believe in this case theyre any less likely to do so. 

In the end, I never read the books in full, so I was just wondering if there was some answer in there as to why exactly the Karstarks didnt challenge the Boltons after the extinction of the starks.",21,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Her army of Unsullied Infantry, multiple but unified Dothraki Cavalry, the original Greyjoy Navy, and a trio of royal dragon Air Force... but one things always bothered me...

... on the second viewing and follow up, I notice there are 2,000 Second Sons who are apparently with her military for multiple episodes, multiple seasons actually... theyre with her from just prior to taking Yunkai all the way until shes sails back to Dragonstone.

So... where are they? Didnt really see them on screen, maybe next time...

They were going to fight the unsullied before joining her... they didnt so no real losses, still 2000 strong (captains dont count, still 1998 warriors if so). Theyre apparently an armored cavalry sellsword group, so each man had a horse which on screen, based on the battle of the bastards, occupies the space of around 4+ infantry soliders, and theyve been involved in multiple major battles according to dialogue and wiki...
  
...but where were they afterwards then? I honestly cant think of a single moment where I looked on the screen and said oh, so THOSE are the Second Sons. 
  
The closest thing was their introduction, and that was just two soon-to-be-dead captains and Daario. Actually, it wasnt even Daario! It was some other random actor who looked nothing like him and more like the wolf from Twilight... apparently the writers thought somehow warranted an actor change even though they had barely been on the show... (I honestly wonder how many people actually, truly, think that the writers intend for those two actors to be the same person... without looking it up on Wikipedia I never wouldve known)
  
Have we ever actually seen the Second Sons on screen aside from a handful at a time like the officers parlay scene? It seems like an interesting group, albeit slightly redundant now that she has multiple Dothraki hordes working together as one khalasar  
  
TLDR: Are the Second Sons ever actually on the show? Or do the writers just kind of wish/pretend they were and then the producers say no cut them out? (Every. Single. Time. Though?)

  
  
  
  
I have a feeling that the 2000 Second Sons is likely just a myth that will never actually be seen because they dont really exist. Im open to pics/videos/links that prove my statement wrong though, Id actually prefer to be wrong and see a clip of 2000 cavalry strong riding into combat.
