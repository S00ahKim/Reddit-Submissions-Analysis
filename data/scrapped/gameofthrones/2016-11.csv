""this link, is made of valerian steel. Only one magister in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries and all who study these mysteries, try their hand at spells. I was no different, I was young and what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers? To lift him out of his dull life into a special one. But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me.""
- Master Luwin 

This shows that some magisters test themselves to see if they have magical ability.
Sam has gone to study to be a magister. So what makes Sam any different than the thousands before him?

It isn't Sam that's special actually, just his timing. 
In the house of undying Daenerys, learned something very important from the kidnapper of her dragons.

""When your dragons were born, our magic was born again. It is strongest in their presence and they are strongest in yours.""
-Pyat Pree

Meaning it is entirely possible Samwell Tarly, will be the newest member of the wizard's club. After all, he does say when him and Jon have their first shift on the Wall ""i always wanted to be a wizard.""

There were some debates here but not specifically dedicated to this aspect. What you guys think?

It kind of came up in a different thread but i think that neither Ned nor Robert really wanted to rule the kingdom. I think the Throne went to Robert because Ned entered the Throne Room before Robert and was able to claim it in Rob's name. I also think Robert would have done the same exact thing for Ned had he entered the Throne Room first given the fact that he clearly had no interest in ruling. 

My question is, how far reaching would this impact be? Obviously the Lannisters wouldn't be nearly as influential. Cersei might still marry Robert though. She obviously can't wed Ned at that point. Do you think Ned's reign would be short since he'd most likely refuse to execute the remaining Targaryeans? And would he legitimize Jon if he found him alive at the Tower of Joy?

Keep getting the security warning wrong. I'm new to this so...

The events of Season 7 of GoT has led to the consolidation of the three stories of the show. 

Daney is in control over all the houses of Westeros, while Jon is still King in the North. The Wall has fallen and the Night King has pushed south without many obstacles. Be it few successful but small victories from the Brotherhood without Banners. Though, they have all fallen as well. 

At the final battle of what is left of the Armies of Men, Daney will sacrifice herself to Melisandre (not by fire but something else? I'd assume something to do with the same magic used by the metallurgist who also work with Valarian steel) so Jon can use the Blood Magic to unbalance the power of the Night King. 

I believe this is the third, and final twist that Benioff and Weiss talk about that GRRM revealed to them.  ",3,5,False,self,,,,,

Bronn seems eager to curry favor with the Hound, buying him drinks and futilely trying to establish some camaraderie.

In the last paragraph of pg 113, it talks about the different schemes that King Aerys II had during his early days of reign, and it says,


&gt; In 264 AC, a visit to King's Landing by Lord Rickard Stark of Winterfell awakened his interest in the North, and he hatched a plan to build a new wall a hundred leagues north of the existing one and claim all the lands between.

But why? Why would he want these lands? There is nothing of any value there and there is little food there too. I mean, he wasn't exactly ""mad"" at this stage, this was in the early years of his reign. 

Plus, this would be a huge venture as this would mean the relocation of thousands of wildlings, that would most certainly lead to a huge conflict. Maybe he wanted extra protection from the wildlings? (who aren't exactly a huge threat to anyone in the North let alone the South). In terms of White Walkers, they were either a complete myth or forgotten about so it can't have been anything to do with them.


All of this, along with the fact that another 300 mile-long (or longer) ice wall would cost a heckuva lot of money, why would he do it? Maybe he was just caught in the moment of being a newly made king and wanted to do something epic, which is probably what we'd all do. ",46,45,False,self,,,,,

Was it just because this would likely mean Jon was older? Do we have any information about the length of Robb and Jon's pregnancies?

Couldn't Ned have claimed that Jon was Brandon's bastard? He wasn't exactly a monk.

Why would Ned take the burden on himself?

Edit - I think this is why the Fisherman's Daughter theory was so popular. Ned would have conceived Jon mere days before marrying Catelyn before he was bound by his marriage vows and in a moment of grief, then Jon could be born after Robb without any major intervening factors.

Then GRRM had to shit on that just because he wanted good themes and to further the plot.",29,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

This was sad.

In season 2, a major moment was Tyrion (albeit Joffery, but Tyrion nonetheless)winning blackwater.
This was happy.

In season 3, oh god.
Very Sad.

In season 4, Tyrion escaped, Nights Watch protected the Wall, Bran found the cave. 
This was happy.

In season 5, Jon died, Cersei had the walk of shame, Dany was taken by the Khalisar, Arya went blind.

Season 6 ended very happily.

Like many of you, I was drawn to this tale of Ice and Fire by the murmurs show [HBO: Game of Thrones]. On my shelf you will find every tale of the Seven Kingdoms, worn from much use. In my blood is mingled the tales of Ice and Fire, its joy and sorrow, might and misery, hope and despairjust as you.

Loyal [Fans] as we may be, the mummer's show will come to an end. Valar Morghulis. Yet we remain, and in the uncertainty that follows, we wonder

I ask you, who shall decide what follows? The high lords [HBO execs] sit in their tower deciding what is to come, and though they claim to hear the cries of the common people and perhaps desire to do so in their hearts, in the end they must bow to their own masterscoin.

Who then can we turn to? We cannot look to the Maker [George RR Martin] who even now is bent to other tasks [Books 6 &amp; 7, Dunk &amp; Egg, etc.] nor can we ask any more of the mummers twins [David and Dan] who have given much and more these past years for our pleasure.

It is WE, my friends, who must speak. 

We make no demands, poor fellows as we are, but ask only for ONE talethe tale of the Last Dragon [Rheagar, and the events that led to Roberts Rebellion/War of the Usurper].

I beg you, spread the word [#LASTDRAGONMOVIE]. Alone, I am No-onebut together we may yet be heard. Let us join our voices, brothers and sisters. 
Sing it to the hearing of all those loyal. Let their voices join ours in song. Here is my coin, give us the tale, of the last dragon! Give us the tale...of the Last Dragon!

I for one would pay good coin for that telling.


In utmost devotion,

The Wandering Prophet


[Hi everyone. I am hoping that many of you, like me  would like to see a MOVIE after the HBO series is done. No Spinoffs!!! If you would like to see a movie centered about Rheagar, the one character who many of us love, and the events surrounding Roberts Rebellion, then please tweet the following as many times as possible and get your friends in on it too : Here is my coin, give us the tale #LASTDRAGONMOVIE",18,0,False,self,,,,,

Will we have another independent kingdom and monarch and have similar situation like the war of the 5 kings with the difference of already formed alliances and recognized sovereignties?

We saw Sansa take a back seat to Jon as he was cheered King of the North by all the northmen. He is seasoned through battle and has the respect of the northmen, but Sansa is the only known true living heir to Winterfell. She was also the reason her family won back Winterfell. It would be interesting to see how this relationship evolves in season seven but I have a prediction.

We have already seen that humans can be converted into White Walkers by getting stabbed in the heart with dragon glass. We also know that a White Walker attack is pretty much unstobbale. If the White Walkers start their invasion and get passed the wall, they will steam roll through the north where they will be faced by Jon and Sansa at Winterfell.

My prediction is that Jon would be forced to retreat south to enlist the help of Danaerys and her dragons (assuming she secures the south and King's Landing). However, Sansa is captured by White Walkers and they use their magic to convert her into one of them and take her as their new Queen. Sansa becomes a queen but not in the way she wanted. Jon teams up with Danerys and her dragons which sets up an epic battle against Sansa, the Night King, and the White Walkers.

Any thoughts, opinions, and comments on this theory are welcomed.

I've finally finished my second run-through of the entire series, from beginning to end. I've picked up a lot of foreshadowing and information that I wasn't paying attention to on my first watch.

After rewatching the final episode of the 6th season again, I realized yet again how earth shattering the impact of the final two episodes will be in the next season.

In the scene where Melisandre is forced to confess to Jon Snow that she had Shireen burned at the stake, I began to think. Melisandre talked her way out of being executed in the exact the same way that she has talked her way through the entire series, claiming that the god of light has a plan for her.

After convincing Stannis to do everything that he had done, she convinced Jon Snow, the only person who we've witnessed denying her seduction, not to execute her. And she does it quite easily, using the same justification she has always used.

Now, we know that Melisandre is ancient. We don't know her exact age, but it is quite clear that she has had much more experience than everyone that we've seen her interact with.

This opens up a wealth of possibilities for where she has been in the past. She could have had a hand in many historic events in the timeline, leading up to where we currently are in the story.

I believe that Bran may end up seeing at least some of Melisandre's past, and it may indicate that Melisandre will play a major role in the events to come.

What are your thoughts?

Yet he often fails to meet one major criteria of this prophecy. That, is Lightbringer, a magical sword only forged within the heart of Azor Ahai's beloved wife. In this matter some turn to Daenerys and say it his her dragons that are this weapon, as they were born from a sacred and tragic fire. It is vague whether this legendary hero will be male or female, so many think it would be a fantastic twist on the legend. While it's a cool idea, I believe it will be Jon and the forging of his blade is yet to come in the following seasons. In the very first episode of this series an emphasis is placed on his love for his littlest sister, Arya. She appears to be the absolute closest person to him despite the atmosphere of unacceptance he lives with in Winterfell. She loves him and does not look down on him at all. This bond is shown through his gifting her the sword ""needle"" and it is the one possession she refuses to get rid of. As Arya continues to slowly become an assassin with the faceless men, she learns how to change her face and appearance. Now, heading to Winterfell to once again be home with her family, I doubt she will drop this habit. Therefore, it is my belief that Jon's sword will become Lightbringer by pure accident. Arya will be disguised in the North, kill the wrong person, and be murdered by her own brother as he carries out what he believes to be a just act being Lord of Winterfell. With the two there is a strong focus on swords given, family bonds, and justice in their stories. It hurts me deeply to think Arya will die, especially in such a tragic way, but it just makes sense to me. She constantly is impeded as soon as she gets close to family and this would tie in beautifully with that theme. ",22,11,False,self,,,,,

While it is obvious to the viewers that the baby is Jon snow because it had basically become common knowledge of r+l=j and they show that's it's Jon right after, it doesn't seem to give any evidence that it's Jon to bran.
 Sure, Bran knows that it's ned and Lyanna but how could he know that the baby is Jon snow. It is possible that he could have heard Lyanna say his true name which obviously isn't Jon snow and somehow figured out that it is actually Jon snow with a different name and that Ned brings him back to winterfell and raised him with a disguise but It just doesn't seem likely.
That being said, let's just assume bran is super detective and knows that's baby Jon. Even if he does, there is no way he could know that rhaegar is the dad which we only know because HBO confirmed our theories. This makes him seeing that reveal basically useless storywise. I mean he could go around saying that Jon is Lyannas son and Ned never really broke his honor which would be a big deal if Ned were still around but since he is dead really doesn't matter at all and has no story purpose to it.
I know that HBO is likely going to have bran somehow be knowing this next time we see him, including that rhaegar is the father, but I think that is stupid because there is absolutely nothing to imply rhaegar is the father in that scene. 
Maybe I am missing something and it is completely obvious even to bran that the baby is Jon and rhaegar is the father

I've been thinking about what purpose the Dothraki horde will serve in Dany's invasion of Westeros, and its led me to wondering if the Dothraki are really an elite army or if their prowess has just been exaggerated through stories and hearsay. I can't think of an example, in the books or the show, of the Dothraki defeating or even facing another competent army besides the time they were notoriously defeated by the Three Thousand of Qohor. For those who don't remember that was Khal Temmo's 50,000 screamers versus 3,000 Unsullied. We also saw Jorah, who's a weak old man if we're being honest, beat Drogo's bloodrider just because the dude was a fucking idiot and tried to hit Jorah in his armor instead of his exposed face. Besides the battle of Qohor, all we really hear about is them riding around, burning shit, killing shepherds, and taking bribes from rich cities who don't want to fight.
 If we're generous with numbers and all of the Dothraki survive the voyage across the Narrow Sea, they should have around 30-40,000 riders. So they would overwhelm the other armies in sheer numbers, but they have so many obstacles to overcome (cold, terrain, armor, etc.) that it seems like they'll be even less effective than when their on their home turf. 

I think the Dothraki are bad ass, but it doesn't seem all this hype built around their skill in battle has any real merit to back it up. So are they really effective against a trained army or are they just a savage people who terrorize Essos through overwhelming numbers?",117,71,False,self,,,,,

**We know GRRMs stance on religion** from interviews and statements. IRL, poorly understood phenomena are often attributed to God(s). In a world of magic and resurrection, there is a lot to be misunderstood. (In world example of no gods - Jon says after death, there is nothing.) So it makes sense that by the end of the series, GRRM is going to drop this huge bomb on us that there are no gods and that any signs of higher-workings have been controlled by humans all along.

**What about the visions in the flames**? In (S4E7), Melisandre explains to Selyse that she has a number of parlor tricks up her sleeves to manipulate flames and make men believe. If Melisandre is able to twist the flames to her bidding, what could a more powerful priestess (AKA The High Priestess) do? Could she manipulate flames from thousands of miles away just like how glass candles allow people to enter other peoples dreams from thousands of miles?

**Kinvara is manipulating the flames of men and priests/priestesses**. This would explain how she knew what Varys saw when his parts were tossed in the fire. Why was Varys so caught off guard when Kinvara asks if he remembers who was speaking those words on the other side of the flames? Is it because Varys recognized HER voice? Why would she be doing all of this?

**Fire and Blood.** There is a connection in Westeros/Essos between magic and these two elements. We know that with the rebirth of dragons into the world, sorcerers control over magic has increased (i.e. House of the Undying). Kinvara uses flames and the Lord of Light to move her pawns. Through a long sequence of events, Varys visions led him to rise to Spymaster and now as an advisor to Dany. We know after building the pyre, Dany instinctually walked into the flames with her dragon eggs, or was it the flames that were calling to her? Melisandres visions led her to utterly destroy Stannis, but without his destruction, she would never have found Jon. While we dont know the ending yet, Jon and Dany have intertwined destinies. All Kinvara does is for the enhancement of Danys team. For the growth of her dragons. For increased bloodshed. For the strengthening of her own magic.

 *He commands you to burn children; your lord is evil!* Davos to Melisandre

*What kind of God would do that?* - Jon

So what do you guys think? Is she the First Servant of the Lord of Light or is she THE Lord of Light? We really need more episodes and books to know for sure (oh my Rhllor, please just give us the damn books, George).
*Edit for grammar.


TL;DR - Kinvara is manipulating people through flames to increase her own power.

This doesn't make sense. If anything, it almost sounds like it is a sort of northwest passage that these traders risked from Asshai.

So, lately I've been going through the series with my friend, who hasn't seen it. We have the subtitles on, so it's easier for us to understand what the characters are saying. 

Watching through the series like this, and seeing my friend gush about how every little detail matters and how every line of dialogue means something, it made me remember why critics praise this show to high heavens. 

To digress, know that I am an avid book reader. The books are amazing to me, and I know that the later seasons have been cutting away much. However, to those who have not read the books (like most television critics that don't waste their time complaining about it on forums), they do not notice these issues. And if they do, which I'm sure they do, little details like Sansa mysteriously keeping her mouth shut about the Vale to Jon, fall to the wayside when they consider the big picture. 

I guess what I'm saying is, to those who focus on the show and not the books, there is a reason why this show is so incredible to them. The characters feel real, the interconnectivity of all the different plotlines is astounding, and of course the aspects outside of the writing (lighting, camerawork, music, acting) are all superb. 

Anyway, these were just thoughts I wanted to share. Especially in light of these later seasons, I see so many fellow book readers being armchair critics, complaining about this little detail and that, getting caught up in the ""big moments"" the show is known for without stopping to consider how the rest of it looks to a ""shownly"" audience.

Imagine she was on the ship again, and spots a post-Reek Theon. She walks past him and stops, examining his face. ""Do I know?"" she asks. Theon avoids eye contact, and silently shakes is head. She shrugs it off and moves on.

I haven't seen a series this good in a while. I want to read the books now. 

Bran's vision in the s06 finale explains Jon Snow's relationship to Daenerys Targaryen. This means that Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Arya Stark are actually cousins as well. I can't help but speculate whether or not Jon Snow will align with the Targaryen house (if that time comes) or if he will align with the Stark house. Dany will surely bring up the fact that Robert Baratheon killed the last Targaryen king and may force Jon into aligning with the Stark or Targaryen house.

Furthermore, there is already some tension between Sansa and Jon, so that leaves an interesting question as to what happens with them. Depending on how Jon decides to pledge, if he must, what will Arya do now that she's a skilled assassin? She seems especially dangerous now.

Lord Baelish has an agenda, as always. He has already told Sansa that he wants her by his side on the Iron Throne. I'm curious if him and Varys are conspiring together to put the Targaryens back on the Iron Throne.

I'd love feedback. Especially if I've gotten any points wrong in my stream of consciousness above.

We're constantly reminded that Cersei cares for no one but her children and herself. At this point she had no children so I think it's fair to assume that she would be fully self-serving. So in seducing Jaime, she left but one brother that could kill her according to the prophecy: Tyrion. Perhaps this, along with the fact that their mother died giving birth to him, is what made her hate him so much.

He argued that there is no 'self' playing the roles. There is no fixed character. We are no-one but the roles we play.

At the end of ""The Winds of Winter"", when Lyanna Mormont initializes the chants, she gives the famous little introduction speech. While this, the camera focusses on Sansa during an [important moment](https://youtu.be/rs4XR4fbY8U?t=2m). ""We know no king but the king in the north, whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard."" 

We know that LF tries to split Jon and Sansa, and in the scene at the weirwood tree, he makes clear that Jon will earn everything and she nothing. When Lyanna said the first sentence, she smiled. Like thinking ""She is right, a Stark rules the north, none else, so she will declare me the queen of the north now. Jon is not a Stark"". And went straight up serious again when Lyanna says the second sentence. I think in this moment she realized that LF was very right about this. She gets nothing (so far) and Jon everything.

Just a small little detail i acknowledged after rewatching the scene. Sorry if posted/mentioned before :)

3.  Ser Davos master of ships.
4.  Brieene and the hound on the end up serving Starks. 
5.  Taking a flier here Hound becomes warden of the west
6.  Varys retains his role.
7.  Master of coin.. maybe Illyro? I think Baelish ends up dead.
8.  Ser Jaime Lord commander of the nights watch
9.   Gendry + Arya ruling Storms end

13.  Royce warden of the east
14.  Jorah on the wall
15.  Sansa to the Vale to marry some knight or Robyn.

Tyrion stands trial for Joffrey's murder, after serving the realm and his family at Blackwater.

Jon is mocked, disrespected, and threatened by his brothers for his many, enduring sacrifices; his killing of Quorin, living with the wildlings, his ranging beyond the wall to quell the mutineers, and his sharing of his knowledge of Mance's forces.

Even the Hound has a little part in it, because we as the viewers get glimpses into his humanity and sense of honor, which I think fights for his conscience more than he lets on. Yet, despite this he garners nothing but hate and blame for the actions of his brother, from whom the Hound has received his fair share of injustice.

Jaime probably understands better than most what Tyrion is going through, and it's interesting to have him as an observer of the whole ordeal.

Although S1E9, 'Baelor', usually gets a mention somewhere in the top ten, I was surprised to see that pretty much all of the popular lists neglect S1E7, 'You Win or You Die'. However, this is still one of the most exciting episodes the show has to offer.

""Eddard Stark's investigations in King's Landing reach a dramatic climax as he confronts Queen Cersei with his findings. Tywin Lannister prepares his forces for battle and gives Jaime an important assignment. Ser Jorah Mormont's actions inspire Khal Drogo to make an important vow. Jon Snow finally takes his place amongst the Night's Watch."" - GameofThrones.wiki

This episode shows Robert's death, and uses it as a catalyst for pretty much everything that happens afterwards. Within the space of about 20 minutes you have Robert calling off Daenerys's assassination, Renly trying to persuade Ned to back his claim (&amp; fleeing) and Jeoffrey claiming the throne (with Cersei tearing Robert's letter in half). Not to mention Baelish's betrayal, putting a knife to Ned in the final shot. Earlier in the episode, we also have the brilliant entrance of Tywin as he guts a stag (showing Jaime who's boss), Jon Snow takes his oath to the Night's Watch and Cersei warning Ned that in the Game of Thrones, 'you win or you die'.

So many famous moments from the show happened in S1E7. It might not be the greatest episode of them all, but surely it's the most underrated.",70,1492,False,self,,,,,

I had nothing to do yesterday afternoon so I created this survey to find out how people would like the ASOIAF series to end:

https://mintandsalt.typeform.com/to/pAFPcJ

It's a 30 question survey (I know, 30!!!) but I am really curious to see the responses. You can try it even if you haven't read the books (just some references in the multiple choices might be obscure for you). 

I will of course publish the general report and then, just for fun, attempt a summary of the ideal ending based on the results.

I'm not talking about ""I would like the Starks kid to live happily ever after with their cute wolf puppies"" but rather ""If this is how it ends I won't feel like tossing the last book out of the window for ruining for me the entire series""!
Please try to keep your answers coherent with the plot!

P.S. I'm fairly new here so I don't know if someone has already done something like that. They probably have. If so, sorry for the repetitiveness!

I've been a huge fan of these and have gotten one for each season. With season 6 launching soon, I've expecting Best Buy to continue this tradition.

Does anyone know if Best Buy has actually ended this tradition? I've been collecting the House editions, and it will really suck when this series is complete and my last two season boxes don't match the rest. I'll settle with the steelbook edition if I have to, but I really do love the House editions.

I am a firm believer that Jon Snow is Azor Ahai. I feel that there is too much evidence to go against this. What I was unsure about until earlier today is how the legendary sword known as Lightbringer comes into play.

Dany has said that she plans for her next marriage to be a political one that helps her move on with her plans to take the seven kingdoms. I am not alone in thinking she will marry Jon Snow. This is where it starts to come together. 

GRRM has said that the ending will be bittersweet. Well what if Dany dies? What if her spouse, Jon Snow stabs her in the heart? I don't mean murder, but rather a mercy killing similar to that of Khal Drogo and following this, Lightbringer is born. Lightbringer is said to be a flaming sword born after Azor Ahai plunged his sword into his wife's heart and I think this could be the case again with Jon and Dany. History has a case of repeating itself when it comes to this show's lore.

Not some random person in battle, not a criminal being executed, not a wildling raider attacking the Wall.

It's his commanding officer, and a Brother.

Kind of sends him down a strange path for kills.

Even more so when you consider Jon has one of the lowest kill counts of the three ""main"" protagonists.

Tyrion

* The Burning of the Blackwater
* Killing Mountain Clansmen en route to the Eyrie
* Various kills during the War of Five Kings
* Shae, Tywin, etc

Daenerys

* Slavers attacking Meereen
* The Khals
* The Warlocks
* Drogo, MMD, etc

Jon

* The Halfhand
* The Mutineers
* Wildling Raiders
* Wildling Soldiers
* Bolton Soldiers

In any case, I only really saw Season 1 of the show before my family [we watch box sets of shows - Netflix, Amazon Prime etc.] started watching BBC and ITV dramas [the ones after the British watershed of 9pm].

I know who some of the characters are - Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister [and also a character prostitute played by a German-Turkish actress, according to IMDB - forgotten her name] to name a few but now I'm going to have to go back to square one and start from scratch.

How can I get back into this show and understand all the complex story arcs - normally the shows I watch don't tend to have story arcs that are all happening at the same time and have as many characters as Game of Thrones [I'm currently watching ITV1's The Level, starring Karla Crome,
Grey's Anatomy [ABC/Sky Atlantic], Goliath [Amazon Prime], and will shortly be watching ABC's The Catch starring Mireille Enos from the Killing on Netflix and Peter Krause from Six Feet Under - when it eventually airs on British television].

I don't need the books to know everything - I am content with the television series.

I know this probably sounds strange having to re-watch a series, but first time round we didn't get that much chance to see it due to disk space on our TV box's recordings [we were watching a few weeks/months' worth of recordings from a Virgin Media box so Game of Thrones had to be put on ice - metaphorically speaking].

I would appreciate any advice and suggestions on how to get back on track/up to speed on this. In line with the rules, I am not discussing about piracy or where to watch the show - this is solely about trying to understand the complexities of it [I usually watch crime dramas, medical dramas, historical dramas but it's a long time since I've seen this show - if you want a TLDR on things].",11,4,False,self,,,,,

I promised to those who took the survey that I would have published the results the day before yesterday but a) I had less spare time than expected; b) I had no idea I would have so many submissions (2772!) c) I didn't considered that so many of you would have filled the ""other"" sections with so many different answers.


If you are curious to see the scores for every answers I prepared for you a presentation [HERE](https://my.visme.co/projects/1jo34n18-results-def).


If you prefer to have a short-er presentation of the results here I will write how the ""perfect"" finale would be according to the voice of the majority!


&gt;Jon will reveal himself as Azor Ahai and save the day by defeating the army of the Others (surely with the help of Dany and her dragons). Melisandre will sacrifice herself and die during the Battle against the Others to help Jon.

&gt;Bran will travel through time and become the legendary Bran the Builder, build Winterfell and Storm's End, defeat the Others in the First Battle for the Dawn and leave some clue on how to defeat them again in the future. He will then take the Three Eyed Raven seat, thus becoming the First Three Eyed Raven.

&gt;Cersei will become the Mad Queen and try to burn King's Landing down (she will probably succeed and that's how the Iron Throne will be destroyed) but will die during the Battle against the Others. I would imagine that if the army of the Others arrives at King's Landing Cersei would try to defeat them by drowning the city in wildfire. Which won't work.

&gt;Jorah will die in his ultimate act of love for Dany.

&gt;The Hound will kill his brother in an epic duel (of course, CLEGANEBOWL) and either die afterwards from his wounds or sacrifice himself to save Arya or Sansa.

&gt;Littlefinger will not be successful in his plans to ""win the game of thrones"" and be executed by the Starks (Jon, Arya and/or Sansa).

&gt;Theon will die for the Starks or (as many of you suggested) for his sister, maybe during the Battle against the Others.

&gt; At the end of A Dream of Spring (supposedly the last book of the series) the Iron Throne will be destroyed but Jon and Dany will marry and rule together over Westeros anyway, restoring the Targaryen dinasty by with Tyrion at their side as Hand of the King and Lord of Casterly Rock, Varys as Master of Whisperes and Davos as Master of Ships. Davos will reunite with his wife and live a peaceful life at court.

&gt;Sansa will be Lady of Winterfell and Wardness of the North and will also sit in the Small Council (Master of Laws/Coin??) at Jon and Dany's court but she will never marry and will die childless (so her marriage to Tyrion will likely be annulled on the basis that she was forced without the consensus of her family and that the marriage was not consummated).

&gt;Arya and Brienne will both be anointed as the firsts female members of the King's Guard.

&gt; SweetRobin Arryn will be Lord of the Vale, Edmure Tully and Rosalin Frey wil be restored as Lord and Lady Paramount of the Riverlands, Yara will take her father's seat at Pyke, Gendry will be legitimized and be given Storm's End and the Stormlands and Dorne and Highgarden will be ruled by one of the Sand Snakes and by Willas Tyrell respectively.

&gt;Jaime's fate is the more confusing: 1063 of you nominated him to be Lord of Casterly Rock but when asked what will be of Jaime most of the votes (969) went for him sacrificing himself. So I'll try to combine the two outcomes: he will briefly become Lord of Casterly Rock but in the end he will sacrifice himself (or suicide) and leave the family's seat to his brother Tyrion.

&gt;The Order of the Maesters of the Citadel will undergo a massive change in his foundamental principles, led by Archmaester Samwell Tarly who will allow maesters to take wife and marry Gilly himself.

&gt;Finally, either Archmaester Sam or Tyrion will write the Song of Ice and Fire (we've almost reach a tie here!).


What do you think of this ending? Did the democratic system worked on finding the best ending or did it failed?? 

Personally I'm quite surprised of some of the outcomes and suspect some of you didn't entirely understood the value of the ""other"" option. For example I expected more of you would have wrote ""killed by Jaime"" in Cersei's fate and ""killed by Sansa"" in Littlefinger's.. And I certainly didn't expect the ""travel through time and become Bran the Builder"" to win!

Some other possible outcomes probably suffered from the fact that I didn't listed them like Jon and Dany being respectively Azor Ahai and the Prince that was promised or Sam becoming Maester of the Night's Watch or again the Maesters of the Citadel remaining basically the same. Sorry for that, maybe I'll do another survey in the future, after TWOW release (fingers crossed!) and fix this issues!

Thank you all for taking the time to answer the survey and for all the suggestions to do it better next time!!

  I was discussing his earlier prediction that tyrion would kill tywin. Tonight, he added more circumstance. I asked him what choice of weapon tyrion would use. He said that tyrioj would likely not use a sword/knife/Axe because he would either not be able to wield such a weapon or wouldn't be willing to use such an up close and brutal melee weapon. I asked him about the possibility that tyrion could use a bow. He said that's not likely, but tyrion could definitely use a crossbow.  The light above his head came on and he said that tyrion could totally use joffreys crossbow to shoot his father. 
  After his prediction, I made sure he was locked into crossbow, so I asked about time and place. He said that tyrion would have to catch tywin off guard in a place where tywin would be vulnerable. He said that tywin would be in bed, or having sex or shaving or... He starts giggling. What if tywin was ON THE TOILET?

Alright, so this isn't 100% certain obviously, since it is a theory and the show branches off a bit and creates some problems. I also know there might be a little confirmation bias present, but doesn't most speculation? Anyways...

Right from the beginning we're told that finding the direwolves is an omen, since there's one for each of the Stark children and it is the sigil of House Stark. The same goes for the stag killing the mother direwolf. Several characters say this, and it is later confirmed there is some truth to the second part when Joffrey has Ned killed. Another thing, which is shown primarily in the books, is that each of the children are in fact linked with their wolves. It's not just Bran who can have the ""wolf dreams"", it's all of them.

So here's where my theory comes in, which is this: The Stark children's fates are tied to their direwolves.

So up first we have Nymeria. Arya chases her off so that she can survive. Arya eventually runs away herself so that she can survive. Nymeria was named after a warrior queen, and in the books we see the direwolf growing an army pack of wolves that basically destroys everything in its path. This whole time, Arya is becoming more and more of a warrior, and in the end of the show she comes back to Westeros to fight and take revenge. So in keeping with the theory... Arya becomes queen of Westeros?

Next we got Sansa and Lady. This one is a little different, since we have Ned kill Lady as part of Cercei's punishment. But what do we see from then on? Sansa wanting nothing to do with her family, denying any real connection to them to protect herself. We also can view Lady's death as the death of Sansa's innocence. Her naive view of the world is shattered, and she assumes everyone is out to get her.

Rob and Grey Wind are a bit more straightforward. Moments apart, they are both stabbed to death and beheaded. Grey Wind's name could be a nod towards Theon's betrayal, but that would be pure speculation.

Jon and Ghost is where things get really interesting. Ghost is always running off somewhere, but eventually returning. We see this happening with Jon, too. He runs off to help Rob, but is convinced to return. He joins the wildlings, but eventually comes back. Yada yada. I want to note that, in the books, Jon is pretty close to being a warg like Bran. Also in the books, it is setup to strongly suggest that a warg could possess an animal in death. We don't know where GRRM was going with this, but in the show we see Jon get killed *but not his direwolf*. As Ghost's name implies, Jon is brought back from the dead by the red woman. Ever since I came up with this theory, I suspected that Jon would die and come back somehow. This was at least 3 years ago, while I was reading through either the second or third book.

Rickon and Shaggy Dog were a little unexpected to me. But as soon we saw Ramsay with Shaggy Dog's head, I knew Ramsay would kill Rickon.

Finally, Bran and Summer. We know Bran is a full warg, if not the most powerful. Though that's not too important to the theory. Of course, Summer's death is a bit problematic here. The direwolf being killed by the army of white walker's could be taken as the end of Bran's innocence as well. Or more likely, it simply signifies that he can no longer be Bran Stark and must embrace his fate as the Three-eyed Raven. Summer's death happening at the same time Bran is changing Hodor seems pretty telling of this. It could also mean that Bran will eventually die while fighting the white walker army. We won't know for sure until later, obviously.

And that's the extent of my theory. The only real mystery now is whether Summer's death has more significance beyond what I can speculate, and what Arya's ultimate fate is. Jon's future is anyone's guess at this point, since he has gone beyond the expectations of my theory.",15,19,False,self,,,,,

After all this years reading ASOIAF I would have thought fans would be more accustomed to this kind of things..many positive characters in the world of ASOIAF practiced or are born into incest. In compare to that a aunt/nephew thing seems pretty mild to me.


But what buffles me the most are those advocating a Jon/Sansa thing rather than Jon/Dany. I mean, not only Jon and Sansa are cousins anyway so I don't see how this would be better than go with the aunt, but they grew up as brother and sister! And in an environment where incest was not accepted!
A Jon/Sansa couple would be waaaaaaaay more gross than a Jon/Dany.


I'll put it this way: if you find tomorrow that your brother/sister was adopted and he/she wasn't related to you by blood, would you find it ok to hook up with him/her? I don't care if that's not techically incest, that would be gross as shit. Way worse than finding out your husband/wife is actually your uncle/aunt you didn't know you had.

Please not that I've only focused on the story of the game, and how it fits in with the wider A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones world, but I will just say that the engine is still awful, the game stutters through all seven hells when changing scenes, and the illusion of choice is more apparent than ever before. Anyway, let's get to the meat of any Telltale game - the story.

Also, it helps to read this in Mr Plinkett's voice.

**House Forrester** - They are what I'd call a forth-rung House (like how House Tollett is sworn to House Royce is sworn to House Arryn is sworn to House Baratheon, House Forrester is sworn to House Glover is sworn to House Stark is sworn to House Baratheon). Then why does this incredibly minor House have sole ownership to the ability to construct the defensive equivalent of Valyrian Steel swords? According to the game, this incredibly rare and valuable resource apparently only grows in two places south of the Wall (both places conveniently obey the contours of the political regions of two minor forth-rung Houses), and House Forrester are the only ones who can work it - why then aren't they richer than the Lannisters, or the Starks, or at very least the Whitehills? If there was a minor House that uncovered the art of re-forging Valyrian Steel they would make enough money to buy and sell the Iron Bank of Braavos. Why is this House so seemingly poor? Is the only reason they are so poor despite their huge deposit of natural resources due to the need to shoehorn in a sense of urgency and foreboding into the plot? Every problem this House runs into throughout the course of the game could be solved if they reached their hand into Ironrath's treasury (which should be overflowing due to the demand of the products of the miracle wood that grows only in their backyard) and hired a sellsword company. Also, why aren't they rushing to the defence of House Glover? This game takes place at the tail end of season three, and throughout season four of the show. During this entire time House Glover's seat of Deapwood Motte is under the control of the invading Ironborn. Why aren't we helping to free our liege lords? More to the point, why haven't the Ironborn invaded Ironrath, considering how valuable Ironwood is?



**House Whitehill** - My biggest gripe with this House is that when you take their location and their religion into account they make zero sense. Ask yourself this: how did a House, sworn to the Boltons, situated north of Winterfell, end up following the Faith of the Seven, the religion of the south? Telltale's decision with House Whitehill just baffles me. The only thing we knew about House Whitehill before this game is that they followed the Faith of the Seven, and every decision Telltale made with them doesn't take this one fact into account. I liked the design of their seat, Highpoint, and I felt it really fit their status, but House Whitehill would make much more sense being sworn to House Manderly (a powerful third rung House in the North that follows the Faith of the Seven, and has numerous vassal forth-rung Houses sworn to it), and having nothing at all to do with this game. 

Also, where does this House make their money? It's repeatedly pointed out how House Whitehill can't work Ironwood, so it's not like they're trading that valuable resource - how then are they able to afford hundreds of Sellswords when House Forrester (which is literally surrounded by valuable natural resources only they can use) cannot also do the same? 

If I had the ability to alter only minor things within this game, I would remove House Whitehill. Have a rival House, by all means, but make it one of the other Houses sworn to House Glover (e.g. House Branch, House Bole, or House Woods -  all of which were introduced in the same sentence in 'A Dance with Dragons' alongside House Forrester). This would also handily explain why House Glover couldn't interfere in defence of the Forresters - they didn't want to pick sides in a skirmish between their vassals. It would also help to make the spread of Ironwood trees more believable, as it would be one large patch of Ironwood trees within the Wolfswood, as opposed to two separate patches spread out on opposite sides of the North. This in turn helps make the fight for resources more believable, whereas the Forrester vs. Whitehill feud displayed in the game is the equivalent of a border dispute between Alaska and Florida.



**House Glenmore** - And thus Telltale stops trying to fit in with the pre-established canon, and creates their own House (because somehow they felt that there weren't enough pre-existing Houses?)! We know they are from the Rills, and that they are likely another forth-rung House (sworn to House Rsywell). Then why does the Lord of this measly, unimportant family have a group of twenty Elite Archers? It's the equivalent of the Mayor of Ord, Nebraska (population 2084) getting a protection unit of 20 members of the Secret Service. For what it's worth, I hated the design of these archers. They didn't look like they fitted Westeros at all, and very clearly done to cut corners, because their awful uniform allowed Telltale to reuse the model. I found Elaena to be an interesting addition to the game, and enjoyed how they utilised the importance of marriage in creating wartime alliances. But before I start getting too positive, I hated her brother Arthur. Not because of his character (he didn't have any personality to hate, he was clearly introduced just to add to the body count), but his awful, awful nickname. ""Here's a guy who practises archery, what should we call him?"" ""Quiver!"". Ugh, so terribly unimaginative.



**House Branfield** - Another House Telltale invented, but they make far less sense within the wider world than House Glenmore. How did a minor House from the Reach marry into a minor House in the Wolfswood? What did either House stand to gain? How did this match get brokered in the first place? The War of the Ninepenny Kings created very odd friendships, I grant you (read up on how Peter Baelish became a ward of Hoster Tully if you need an example), but that occurred almost forty years before the start of the game, so that clearly couldn't of resulted the match between Gregor and Elissa! Both Houses could've made far better political matches within their own regions. It's also been pre-established how insanely rare this type of match is in both the books and the show. The only Reach/North marriage we know of is when Jorah Mormont married the daughter of Leyton Hightower. But let's break it down further: Jorah had recently distinguished himself as a fighter in the Greyjoy Rebellion. Jorah had also just won further renown at the Tourney at Lannisport, and asked for Lynesse's hand in marriage following his victory. Jorah was the future Lord of Bear Island, a principle bannerman to House Stark. Jorah was a widower, whose first bride was a match of politics. Lynesse was Lord Hightower's eighth born daughter, and her older sisters had already secured her father multiple alliances with his neighbouring lords in the Reach, including his liege lord Mace Tyrell. This match was made through a rare set of circumstances which certainly didn't occur for Gregor the Good.

Secondly, how did this House manage to lose their seat? It's mentioned that they lost it in the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion, but this goes against everything we know about King Robert and his post-war administration. He forgave literally everybody! Robert forgave House Tyrell, House Martell and all of the Crownlands Houses for defending the Targaryens. He forgave House Greyjoy following their rebellion. We know that some Houses, such as House Connington, or House Merryweather, or House Mooton - all staunch supporters of the Targaryens, with the former two each having members serve as Aery's hand of the King - had the size of their lands reduced, but they still kept a hold of their keeps, and parts of their land. Why are we supposed to believe that Robert took the lands off a minor House like House Branfield? We know that the male line is still around, as Malcolm Branfield (y'know, the guy they wrote out halfway through the game to hang around with Daenearys, despite never being mentioned in the books or the show) is still alive, and was certainly able to keep the line going. The entire reasoning behind House Branfield losing their seat goes against everything we know of King Robert and his philosophy of turning the other cheek, and just feels downright wrong within the wider story.



**The Sentinel** - Firstly, why is this forth rung House the only House to practise this? It's painfully obvious how Telltale wanted to try to recreate the Hand of the King position, but it makes no sense when we're playing as such a minor House as this one. Anyway, let's just ignore the that glaring inconsistency with the rest of Westeros. When Ethan became Lord, to fit the brash and offensive play style I had picked for him, I opted to make the warmongering Ser Royland Degore his sentinel. However, when Rodrik became Lord, why could I not switch to Duncan Tuttle? Ethan chose a new sentinel following the death of Gregor the Good, why could I not change it following Rodrik succeeding Ethan? I routinely picked the options that allowed me to play Rodrik as I wanted to play him: unconfident, appeasing, uncertain, and yearning for an end to hostilities. Why oh why could I not change my sentinel to Duncan in order to reflect this decision? Well, there's an answer, and it's to do with shoddy writing. Midway through the first of six episodes you are given a binary choice, do you make Ser Royland or Duncan Tuttle your Sentinel? Well, if you choose Ser Royland, Duncan takes it very well, and continues to prove his unwavering love and loyalty to House Forrester. He fights to protect them, he mourns their dead with them, he encourages his nephew to break his sacred vow and betray the Night's Watch to better serve House Forrester, he consistently preaches peace to bring an end to the bloodshed and keep House Forrester safe, and at the end of episode five it's revealed that he's actually been feeding House Whitehill information all along, prolonging the bloodshed and constantly weakening the future of House Forrester. Alternatively, if you pick Duncan, Ser Royland puts this slight aside and literally attacks House Whitehill to save the lives and livelihood of House Forrester (including at one point attempting to murder Lord Whitehill), both at Lord Rodrick's command and of his own volition, and the risk of his own life, only to have it revealed in episode five that... he's a spy for House Whitehill. Whose Lord he tried to kill. And whose soldiers he tried to kill. And who he's always trying to get us to take up arms against. The motivation for their betrayal makes no sense, their actions do not correspond with their betrayal in any way, and the fact then when decision is locked in from episode one only serves to show how poorly written this whole debacle is. Keep in mind how I pointed out how Telltale denies us the option to change Sentinel after changing Lord, meaning that their own poor writing even contradicts the (admittedly poorly constructed) lore that they themselves created. This is a Telltale choice in a nutshell.
 


**Finn** - Does anyone else think it doesn't make sense that Finn follows the Old Gods? He purportedly comes from around Raventree Hill, the seat of House Blackwood, who worship the Old Gods - but would the Smallfolk in that region not follow the Seven? I can understand that an ancient noble House like the Blackwood's would keep to their traditions, but their Smallfolk? We hear time and time again how prevalent the Faith of the Seven is in the Riverlands, it seems unimaginable that the Smallfolk surrounding Raventree Hill hadn't been converted over time. Infact in book four we see firsthand how the Smallfolk of the Riverlands react to people who don't follow their Faith (see the overall spread of R'hllor across the Riverlands, including the part where Septon Meribald leads the orphans in prayer, and the reactions when Gendry (a worshiper of R'hllor) abstains). We also know how exceedingly rare Weirwood trees are south of the Neck, so how do these Smallfolk practise their religion? Are we supposed to believe that Finn (and the rest of these apparent Old Gods worshippers in the Riverlands) all travelled to the Isle of Faces to worship? Or are we supposed to believe Lord Tytos Blackwood let all of these Smallfolk into his Godswood to worship? It makes no sense. 

Also, in episode three, how was he able to read my map? Whilst we don't know what his profession was, we know he's a low born commoner. We also know he couldn't of learnt to read from a Septon, as Telltale made him worship the Old Gods (for some reason). Looks like Telltale missed the point when Tywin Lannister said ""He was a well-read stonemason? Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason"". 



**Cotter** - Go back and watch the scene from Season 1, where Osha is captured, wherein she and her Wildling companions get caught and threaten to kill Brandon Stark, a boy of 10. Then watch the Jon Snow scenes from Season 3. Notice how the wildlings treat Jon, a Crow whose has abandoned the Wall for Mance Raydar. Then watch Battle for the Wall in Season 4, and the ferocity with which the Free Folk attack the Night's Watch. Then look at Hardhome in Season 5, and the immediate reluctance most wildlings have at the prospect of joining forces with the Night's Watch, even though their backs are up against the wall, and their situation is beyond desperate. Now, with all this in mind, picture the moment when Cotter gets caught stealing weapons south of the Wall. Why, with everything we know of Wildling/Night's Watch relations, would Cotter choose to join the Night's Watch? Why would he befriend members of the Watch? Wildlings joining the Watch isn't unheard of in the books, but this only happens after Jon Snow lets them pass through the Wall. Cotter's presence in the Night's Watch completely negates the gravity of Wildlings like Leathers who take the black, and of the other Wildlings who agree to help man the Wall.

Also, like Finn, how can this Wildling suddenly master the science of reading? Is Telltale seriously suggesting that there are people north of the Wall writing and reading books? 
He also uses the phrase ""Seven Hells"" to express surprise. Why? He's a wildling, who almost entirely keep to the faith of the Old Gods (although there are a few tribes in the extreme northern reaches who keep their own unique deities). In the North, belonging to the Faith of the Seven is a rare thing (see my House Whitehill section), to the point where they're mostly situated to regions around the White Knife, in the southernmost part of the North. With this in mind, how did Cotter become so acquainted with the Faith of the Seven that he could pick up a phrase like ""Seven Hells""? 



**Frostfingers** - Oh look, it's the guy Telltale created because they didn't hire Ser Alliser Thorne's actor! Oh look, he's got all of negative features of Ser Alliser without any of the redeeming qualities that make Ser Alliser a well rounded character! Oh look, he's got an awful nickname. I sure hope this completely one-dimensional character isn't a sign of things to come (spoiler alert, it is). Frostfinger is actually representative of a number of characters in this game. So many characters are just carbon copies of show/book characters, and instead of making me care about them and invest in them (as I did with Ser Alliser Thorne), all I can think about is how shoddily written, poorly constructed and bizarrely motivated they are. Frostfinger is a poor imitation of Ser Alliser. Elissa Forrester is Catelyn Tully. Lord Morgyn is  Littlefinger. Finn is Karl Tanner. There are other characters who, whilst not as blatantly a rip off as others, are equally one dimentional. Maester Ortengryn  is there only to heal your character, and exposit some dialogue about the family tree, with no character of his own. Sylvi is the tough little wildling girl. Croft is the brash sellsword captain. And all of them are just so dull.



**Jon Snow** - Why was Gared sent to Castle Black? Send him to join the Night's Watch, sure, but why bother having Gared go to Castle Black? It's no exaggeration when I say he takes no part in any of the important events at Castle Black such as the debate over whether they should attack the Wildlings raiding The Gift, he's not there for the choosing of the next Lord Commander, he doesn't participate in the attack on Craster's Keep - all these events at Caste Black pass him by, his presence is beyond inconsequential. He doesn't give us a chance to see the other side of minor antagonists (like Karl Tanner, or Ser Alliser, or Janos Slynt), we don't get to see the very minor characters (like Othell Yarwyck, or Donnel Hill, or Three Fingered Hobb) fleshed out, we don't meet characters from the books (like Dywen, or Iron Emmet or Satin), and we don't get to revisit characters now dead (like Maester Aemon, or Pyp, or Grenn). We don't even get Samwell Tarly. Instead we get Jon Snow. Don't get me wrong, I love Jon Snow, but his appearance is both underused and unnecessary. When we first meet him he has just come back from the great ranging, most of his Brothers think he's still loyal to the wildling cause, and he is currently awaiting trial for breaking his vows. All of this, and yet he's able to dictate orders to Frostfinger, randomly pull his brothers out of training at a moment's notice, and escort new recruits on their way to take their vows? The only reason Gared went to Castle Black was to meet Jon Snow, so that Telltale could advertise the game as featuring Jon Snow. He could've been dispatched to Shadow Tower or Eastwatch-by-the-Sea (places that thusfar have only received passing mentions in both the books and show), and give us a chance to see a part of Westeros we've never seen (more on this later on).



**Margaery Tyrell** - Throughout the entirety of the King's Landing plot you never interact with ANYONE from any of the other four stories, and NOTHING you do impacts on the other stories whatsoever. Mira's entire story can be completely removed from the game and the story would be none the worse and still make as much narrative sense. This is because Telltale could get several actors from the cast of King's Landing, and needed part of the story to take place there to justify it. Enter, Lady Mira. The fact that Mira is Margaery's handmaiden is completely baffling to me. We know who is in Margarey's Household. We know that most of Margaery's ladies in waiting come from other branches of House Tyrell, and that the rest are daughters of her father's bannermen such as House Merryweahter and House Crane. The game tells us that Mira's mother, Elissa, arranged this, but this just raises so many more questions. It would be a very privileged position for someone to be a lady-in-waiting to the future Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, so what did Lady Elissa offer to broker this? If the promise of Ironwood tempted the Tyrells, then why doesn't House Forrester have more promising and frequent marriage offers in exchange for Ironwood (surely at least House Glover would be interested, if not House Stark)? Are we meant to believe Elissa utilised her ties to the Reach through House Branfield to tempt the Tyrells, despite the fact they haven't had political ties there in decades (See the House Branfield section at the top for extra reasons why this appointment is baffling)?  Was Margaery comfortable having a handmaiden whose family was actively rebelling against the Iron Throne, and who were at war with both her family and the family of her betrothed? Was Mira with Margaery when she was betrothed to Renly? If she wasn't with Margaery when she was with Renly, wouldn't it make Mira's appointment all the stranger, considering every House in the North was in open rebellion at that time? If she was with Margaery when she was married to Renly, why didn't House Forrester declare for Renly? Why didn't they declare for Joffery once House Tyrell switched allegiances? Why didn't Renly/Joffery use Mira as a hostage in the War of the Five Kings, as they did with other highborn prisoners?  Wouldn't Margaery and Mira follow different Gods, and wouldn't that affect the choice of handmaidens (also, for a series in which Religion plays such an important part, this game's complete absence of it is staggering, especially considering House Whitehill follows the Faith of the Seven)? 

As well as been unfeasible within the setting, Mira's appointment also creates holes within the wider plot. Do you all remember how in Season/Book 3, Margaery used to keep calling on Sansa Stark whist Olenna Tyrell was trying to arrange a match with Loras/Willas Tyrell? Why, if Margaery was trying to get close to Sansa, didn't she use Mira? Think about it: Sansa and Mira are both from the North, they're both the same age, both worship the same Gods, both have lost family members as a result of the War of the Five Kings. It would be a great way to lull Sansa into trusting Margaery, by showing her another Northern girls admiration for her. So what possible reason did Margaery have for not bringing her Northern handmaiden along? The only one I can think of is that Sophie Turner said no to Telltale.



**Sera Flowers** - Sera's appointment makes even less sense than Mira's! By getting closer to Mira, Margaery does at least gain some influence with another House (albeit a minor, forth rung House on the other side of Westeros). By having a bastard take up a valuable place in her household Margaery not only gains nothing in return, she is actively losing out by not giving this place to the daughter of one of her father's powerful bannermen. It could've gone to a Rowan, or a Tarly, or a Redwyne or any other important family. Olenna and Margaery have demonstrated time and time again that they are very adept at playing 'the game of thrones', then why did they make this mistake by not offering the position to a more valuable handmaiden? Or rather, why did Telltale make this mistake?



**Tom** - I pushed this guy away at every opportunity, yet he just kept coming back for more. Why do Tom, Mira and Telltale think it is completely normal behaviour for the Queen's handmaiden and a coal boy to keep meeting in broad daylight, in front of other members of the Royal court? I played Mira as someone who cared little for the Smallfolk, particularly in her interactions with Tom. When we first meet, and he asks to do the fires in Mira's room? I sent him away, and told him to come back later. When Damien the Lannister guard was drowning Tom? I ran away, and left him to die - Mira doesn't want to get blood on her hands just to save some coal boys life! When Tom considers going into Tyrion's chambers to find the Ironwood decree, at great personal risk to himself? I threatened him into doing it - so what if he dies, the decree is more important than a coal boy's life! When Lord Morgryn's offer of marriage involves saving my life at the cost of Toms? You bet I take his offer, there'll be other coal boys! Then why did Telltale completely ignore my choice to make Mira not care about Tom? Why does she keep meeting up with him in public, why does she act happy to see him, and worried when he's in danger? Why should I keep bothering to play if Telltale is going to tell me how my characters feel? 



**Lord Morgryn** - Lord of where? Who are you? Where do you come from? What's your relationship with House Whitehill? Why can't you have the same relationship with House Forrester? Can your presence in the story and the wider realm of Westeros be explained slightly more than not at all? Same goes for Lord Andros. Also, following a comment he made in episode six, I feel the need to point out that Lannister guards don't protect King's Landing, that's the Goldcloaks, otherwise known as the City Watch of King's Landing. 



**Ramsey Snow** - Ramsey has no business showing up in this game. From the very first second the opening credits end he is the bastard son of the new Warden of the North, making him one of the most important political figures in the North. Why is he wasting his time with this supposedly unimportant House? At the time of the first episode, Ramsey should be busy flaying Theon, and waiting for his father to return to the Dreadfort. Why then is he traversing the breadth of the North - from the Dreadfort in the East to the Wolfswood in the West - to harass House Forrester? Moat Cailin is still being held by the Ironborn, as is Deepwood Motte, does Ramsey really have nothing better to do then sort out a rivalry his Father's vassal has? Shouldn't he be getting oaths of fealty from House Manderly, or House Reed, or House Mormont, or any other important House instead of this minor one? It's not like he's overly passionate about the cause, he just gives up half way through the game! The absolute nadir of Ramsey's appearances is when you get to put a knife to his throat, and you get a Telltale choice to whether to kill him... despite the fact we know full well that he is alive and well in the books and show and all tension is completely removed and the illusion of choice shines so bright that it is visible from space. He has no stake in this whatsoever, and he's only in the game because they wanted as many show connections as they could get - and it shows.



**Battle at the Harbour** - This 'battle' is the perfect metaphor for this game. Where on Westeros is this harbour? Let's say it's near Ironrath. It makes perfect sense right, as it would mean that Rodrick and company spend as little time as possible away from Ironrath, right? However, this means that Asher and company have to travel across a Daenarys-ravaged Slaver's Bay, past/through old Valyria, past Volantis (where the waters are teeming with slavers), past the stepstones, past the Sea of Dorne, around the Reach, past the Westerlands, past the Iron Islands (which at this point of time are still in open rebellion), past 75% of the North's coast before reaching this empty port potentially located North of the Wolfswood, a trip that should by rights take months. Conversely, if we say that the docks are on the Eastern coast of the North? Not only does that mean that Rodrick would have had to of left Ironrath undefended and Lordless for all the time it takes to cross the breadth of the North (keep in mind the words of Roose Bolton, ""The North is larger than the other six Kingdoms combined"") , but the ship would have had no make the same perilous journey, substituting Ironbon Reavers for more slavers and pirates. How did both Rodrick and Asher know which dock to go to? There is no visible landmark in the harbour, nothing to distinguish it for the two parties. Where are the harbour's inhabitants? We know that some locations along the Mander are deserted as of the latest book, with many of the people fleeing to the sanctuary of their liege lord in White Harbour, away from Winter and the Boltons. Where did these people go? If they went to their liege lord doesn't it prove that this dock isn't in Forrester territory, because as Lord surely someone would of mentioned the influx of refugees to Rodrick. Does this mean that Rodrick has travelled even further away from Ironrath than my previous estimate? By extension, doesn't this further remove all dramatic tension when you consider how in this month longer excursion Lord Whitehill didn't once try to take the severely undefended Ironrath? And Gryff's ambush working somehow manages to make less sense than this entire faade. How did he know where the meeting was supposed to take place, what with his spy (the one I chose not be Sentinel) being locked up in a dungeon? How did Asher and Rodrick know which Harbour to meet each other, and on which day? It's not like Asher's ship had a Maester and a flock of ravens aboard. Even if word was sent before Asher departed from Meeren, how did Rodrick know what day he'd arrive, the sailors have no idea what day they would be arriving on, let alone what time. How did Asher know which dock to go to? None of his crew know the area, and he was sent into exile years ago. How did the Whitehills know which of the exits the group would use? Is this dockside town completely walled in, with only one exit? Why would it be built that way? How did he know that Rodrick and Asher would be at the tail end of the group, and not, y'know, leading their small band of fighters, like leaders are supposed to do? Also, why weren't Rodrick and Asher leading their small band of fighters, like leaders are supposed to do? This scene was so poorly construct it's liable to collapse and any moment.



**Battle at Ironrath** - I get it that the Forrestors are the underdogs in this fight, but what possible excuse is that for this immense violation of the sacred Guests Rights? We gave Lord Whitehill and his retinue our bread and salt back in episode one! They were under our protection, and Telltale railroads us into breaking one of the ancestral traditions of the culture of Westeros, without any option to do anything else! They didn't either stop to consider that the player wouldn't want to break the guests and take revenge on them. They just ploughed ahead with the incredulity, and didn't stop to consider whether or not we would be invested with their characters enough to make them want to break character in such a substantial way! Just take a look at the karmic retribution of House Frey for the Red Wedding, or the story of the Rat Cook (which was included in both show and book) - why did Telltale force us into doing this? 



**North Grove** - Boy what a disappointment! The whole thing only serves to highlight that Telltale didn't even believe they could concoct an interesting enough story out the A Song of Ice and Fire world without forcing a magic mcguffin into the story to try and give the story more of a hook. The North Grove is guarded (what precisely is being guarded, from whom, and why are just three of the many questions that aren't addressed, despite the fact that the North Grove is the main plot of this game) by Elsera and Josera Snow, Gregor the Good's bastards. This raises sooo many questions. Who guarded the North Grove before them? They can't be more than twenty five, has this sacred place only been protect for a quarter of a century? How did these two get there? As we saw with Gared, it's a difficult journey to make even with two wildling companions, so how did Gregor the Good make the trip with two children? Did they scale the Wall (which as shown in Season 3 is very difficult, likely more so with two children on your back)? Did they just walk through Castle Black (which you can't do)? Did no one notice how Gregor the Good was gone for over a year on a roundabout trip whilst taking his bastards to the North Grove (considering how Lord Whitehill will throw shade at you for any little slight, I find it hard to believe he'd let not only his two bastards, but also his extreme length of absence go without mentioning it)? Unless their mother took them, in which case how did a pregnant woman make this trip? If she did make the trip, why would Gregor the Good tell her where the North Grove was, whilst not mentioning it to anyone in his family? As they have the surname Snow it means they were publicly acknowledged bastards (hence why Ramsey is a Snow, but Gendry isn't a Waters), so why didn't Elissa or anyone else mention them (again, Lord Whitehill should've been harping on about this constantly!)? If they were South of the Wall until recently what did they do? Where did they live? Why do they hold the same prejudices about the Night's Watch as Wildlings if they are from South of the Wall? If his bastards have spent their entire lives in the North Grove, how do they know what House Forrester is? How are they able to recognise the Forrester sigil, and differentiate at a glance a necklace that had been made by Ironwood and not regular wood, did their father send a Maester along too? If they've spent their entire lives in the harsh frozen wastes, why do they have any emotional connection to Gregor the Good or House Forrester at all? Unless they went to the North Grove after they were born, in which case was the North Grove protected for even less time than my previous estimate? Why do the other Wildlings in the North Grove obey the command of a bastard woman from South of the Wall? How did she learn blood magic? How does she know the magic ritual to restore her power? How did she learn the Old Tongue? How did Josera learn to master his Warging abilities? If you go with the suggestion their mother was a Wildling, how did she ever come across Gregor the Good? If Gregor the Good taught her the Old Tongue, how did he learn it, and how come in the several years he would have to travel from Ironrath, make his children bilingual (likely without the help of a Maester, despite the fact one of their duties is educating) and travelling back to Ironrath did no one notice his absence? How did Gregor the Good come to know about the North Grove? Is it a secret past down from father to son, in which case why didn't Rodrik know about it? Considering how is this place is somehow known of by both isolated wildling tribes North of the Wall (like Sylvi) and commoners from the Riverlands (like Finn), how is it that this forth rung House has kept it secret all this time? Do their liege lords, House Glover and House Stark, know about the North Grove? If they do, why haven't they acted upon this? If they don't, how and why has House Forrester kept this a secret? Also, why does no one in the books or the show mention the North Grove, be it as part of a fairy tale or an actual location? If the location isn't past from father to son, did Gregor the Good just stumble upon whilst walking hundreds of miles from his home? If he didn't know the precise location, how did Josera and Elsera find their way? Did he just give his bastards vague directions and send them on their way? If he gave them the same map Gared received, are we to believe there are multiple copies of that map just lying around? If the North Grove is so powerful, and Elsera and Josera have spent their lives defending it, why are they content to begin the long march south to reclaim Ironrath at a moment's notice? If this place has magical properties to protect its inhabitants, why isn't Mance Rayder marching his people there instead (It would be a lot more convenient and much less bloody than attacking the Wall)? If this place has only been protected for a decade or so, why hasn't it been previously colonised by the Hornfoots, or the Thenns, or the Ice River Clans, or the Giants? If the magic was keeping them out, why did it let Elsera and Josera in, and Gregor the Good before them? And, most importantly, HOW IS THE OVERARCHING PLOT POINT OF THIS GAME RIDDLED WITH SO MANY PLOT HOLES? WHY ISN'T THIS PLACE EXPLAINED SLIGHTLY MORE THAN NOT AT ALL? 



**Conclusion** - From the day this game was announced I kept going over and over the possibilities for this game. My first thought was a Recruiter from the Night's Watch, going from peasant villages, to market towns, to cities across all seven kingdoms, recruiting boys and men alike to take the black, and having some adventures along the way. Then I thought it could be similar to the Ser Duncan the Tall novella series, and have you play as a Hedge Knight, going from keep to keep to sell your sword, and maybe take part in a few notable battles and lesser known skirmishes. I thought it could take place during Aegon's conquering, or the Dance of Dragons, or the War of the Ninepenny Kings, or Robert's Rebellion, or the Greyjoy Rebellion. But Telltale chose to force themselves into a corner by picking the exact period of the show and books, having us play as a minor House, and yet somehow having these minor characters regularly having meetings the most important people alive at the time to the extend where I spent most of the game waiting for a character called Gump Forrester to appear. This game feels like such a waste of a great licence, with so much squandered potential. Take the Greyjoy Rebellion as an alternative setting. We could have played both sides of the War, such as one of Balon's sons who died during their father's war (or maybe Balon's brother, Victarion Greyjoy, and have him die at some point, which would serve to both explain his absence from the television series and keeping both book readers and show watchers in suspense whilst playing), a member of House Mallister at Seaguard, a member of House Lannister at Lannisport. We could have seen the coronation of Balon, the burning of the Lannister fleet, the siege of Pyke, the Tourney of Lannisport. We could've seen many show characters like Tywin Lannister, Ned Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Robert Baratheon, Balon Greyjoy, Jorah Mormont, etc, with none of the character interactions or appearances feeling as inconsistent or forced within the wider story as what Telltale gave us. This game could have fit in so succinctly with the wider story of both the show and the books, but every baffling decision made by Telltale just has everything stick out like a sore thumb.",32,62,False,self,,,,,

""I'm the Three-Eyed-Raven now, I have to be."" Bran replies, exhausted still.

Ready for what?  How did she know what he was going to look into?  It had been several episodes since the Tower of Joy flashback.  Honestly, I thought the interlude to the R+L=J revelation wasn't very well done.  It didn't make sense, he just kind of went back to that flashback, didn't tell Meera or the audience.

To me, it seemed out of place and with no context to what had just been happening the past few episodes.  I understand it was at the back of his mind, but we the viewers were on a completely different time line are not in Bran's head.

I felt the way he just randomly dove back into that flashback felt rushed, forced, and like they didn't know how to introduce it.

""Are you sure you're ready?""  Meera asks.

We all know about the legend of lightbringer, about how it was tempered in water but broke, then a lion, and still broke then by his wifes heart and soul to become the lightbringer. We also know that most myths and prophecies are vague and should not be taken literally.

So many these can be applied to the story of Lightbringer as well. What if the sword temperance in the water was simple life, the day to day aspect of it. Life is after all a symbol of life.  Without water we all die.  But in the fight against the Nights Kings army, being alive is simply not enough; the lion is often seen as a symbol of bravery and duty.   But again just being brave and following you duty will not stop the Night Kings army either, you have to be willing to give up everything and while at the same time have something to fight for. You need a purpose that transcends life and bravery.  And what is often used as a symbol for something like that?  Well love, the heart and soul.

So who is now going through that transformation? Who has given up his life to fight the winter? Then given up his duty and bravery and love for the fight  for anything else then the fight the winter? 
Of course its Jon.
He joined the Nightswatch  giving up his life, he went behind the wall and broke his oaths to get more men to fight the coming winter. And He lost his love while doing this so now he is free from everything to focus solely on the war against the Nights King

I'm not saying it's not possible, but how big is the War for the Dawn supposed to be? The last war in the show lasted for about 3 whole seasons, and keep in mind that no field battles were actually shown. The battle of Black Water Bay was shown, but none of Rob Starks victories were shown, and neither were any of the Greyjoy sieges of northern holds. 

These upcoming wars are not like bastard bowl. What I mean by that is the fact that I don't expect to see them won or lost in one battle. And the reason why I think the war between the White Walkers may not happen in the way we think it will is because of their symbolism. They symbolize death above anything else, and death comes for all no matter how much you try to fight it. No matter the accomplishments of the characters in the story, death will eventually triumph over them. GRRM has said that the end of his story will be bitter sweet, this could mean that all the protagonists will get what they want while all the antagonists get what they deserve, but in the end, winter and death beats them all.

I know i havent done much research or provided direct quotes, but it seems to fit in. All the time spent with their relationship would make sense.

Its all works because he's a player out of left field, no one really paid him much mind. Barely anyone believed he killed a WW.

So, Tywin Lannister had been Hand of the King for years and year before Robert's rebellion, and by all accounts, appeared to do well. The realm prospered. Eventually, he get's sick of Aerys's crap, quits, and returns to the Rock. Robert's Rebellion then happens, and Tywin sits on his hands to see how everything works out. 
My question is: Why did Tywin bother to sack King's Landing?
Here are my thoughts:

1. He had dedicated a large portion of his life to running the 7 Kingdoms. Why would he effectively decimate the capital city when Aerys is on the verge of being de-throned anyways? It's not as if the sacking would contribute to actually winning the war.

2. I reject the notion that his army did it on their own accord. That would be wildly undisciplined and Tywin would not tolerate that in his forces.

3. Sacking a (mostly) undefended city was not necessarily going to buy him the love of Robert. Tywin stayed out of that war, and everyone knew. If he wanted to give King's Landing to Robert to pretend he'd helped, he still could have done that without the actual sacking.

I BECAME OBSESSED! So I thoroughly enjoyed watching all the seasons I could but as we do here I had constant questions and theories on things way too far in advance and it did make me a little crazy.  After this last season I FINALLY decided to read the books and man... I didn't think it could get any better.  I'm even more OBSESSED.  So many characters and such rich history and plots, it's simply amazing.  So now I haunt this reddit all day looking to consume any knowledge or point of views that i can and enjoying all the art and songs and cosplays but now I feel a tad bit empty waiting on Mr. Martin to finish his books and HBO to finish ""their version"" which as we know from the last few books is pretty different. Anyways, every day I see alot of the same questions asked over and over that can be answered pretty easily if you follow my ADVICE which is this:  READ THE BOOKS PEOPLE! READ THEM ALL! THEN GO BACK AND READ THEM AGAIN!  THEN GO BACK AND WATCH THE SERIES AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Every time you miss subtleties here and there and each time you learn something new or appreciate something more.  But read those books.  It's the source material and actually makes for a far better story than even the show, i know you don't think it's possible but it is.  I PROMISE.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

So to them, even though it was for a noble cause to retake Winterfell, Jon Snow is still a deserter of the Night's Watch. If they are to honor the laws, shouldn't they also call for Jon to be executed? This is a downer I know, but I'm just trying to make sense of the situation from their perspective.

We know Howland kept tabs on Ashara during the tourney at Harenhall. We know Ashara had a daughter. We know Ned met with her before returning to Winterfell with Jon. Meera is an uncommonly talented warrior (perhaps the next wielder of the sword of the morning).


There is not a ton of evidence, admittedly, but there is also a shroud of mystery around the entire Reed family.

I'm curious about their respective titles. Both served as Kingsguard under Aerys Targaryen, and both fought for him during Roberts Rebellion, with Ser Barristan cutting down men at the Trident and getting injured in the process. 

Except, after the war, Ser Aliser is to choose between execution or taking the black (like many others) while Ser Barristan is appointed Lord Commander of the Kingsguard under Robert. 

Was this because both Ned and Robert admired Ser Barristan for his legendary honor and fighting skills? Robert even had his own maester tend to Ser Barristans wounds after the Trident. 

Does anybody have any other info/opinions on this?

But as interesting as his story is (and he's one of my favourite characters), I can't figure out why Theon Greyjoy is still around. Is it just to sail Dany and her meatheads into town?

Secondly, this will contain SPOILERS for Game of Thrones up to the end of Season 6, so if you aren't caught up, read on at your own risk




FINAL SPOLIER WARNING
__________________________________________________

Okay, so if you're still here, in S01E08 - ""The Pointy End"" Jon comes to the aid of Lord Commander Mormomt as a Wight has gotten into his chambers. He stabbs the wight several times and puts his sword right through his chest, but as you'll know this doesn't work so he grabs a lantern that Mormont was holding and throws it at the wight. This finally does the trick but Jon in the process burns his hand as any normal person would. 

However, we know that from S06E10 - ""The Winds of Winter"" Jon is no ordinary man, he is the song of ice and fire, both Stark and Targaryen, but if that is the case then why did he burn his hand. Because we know that Daenerys is a Targaryen and she can walk through fire and not get burnt.

I know there's probably a really simple explanation out there but I can't seem to find it.

Also, applogies again if this post isn't in keeping with the usual standards or has been discussed before.

Any help very much appreciated.",10,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

What are they doing? Where are they going? Why do they need Gendry? I feel Gendry has a huge role to play in wherever they are going. Could it have something to do with arya maybe? They appear to be sailing from dragon stone, so it could be them trying to get back to winterfell discretely as possible, however I'm not sure why jorah would be coming if that's the case.

Ok. So I was thinking in the show, the final season, the Night King was able to breach the underground chamber that housed the children. His primary abilities are reanimation but I had no clue why he could see Bran in the first place to gain access to the cave.

So, I have so many questions! Does the dragon glass in his heart give him access to the children's magic? If it does, the implications are huge. He could potentially undo the magic that remains on the wall. And if he doesn't know how, he can simply reawaken Brans great^100 grand father and see how it was done in the first place.

The ability of the tree to see any location in the past makes it easy for him to locate the horn of Joramund. (I believe Samwell Tarly took it to Oldtown in the books?)

He basically has access to the entire library of history of Westeros. 

I guess that was only two questions. How much magic do you think he can perform? Do the events in the books overlap greatly as in the show? What do you think?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

1. Robert's Rebellion started after the Abduction of Lyanna Stark. I've seen theories that Lyanna willingly went with Rhaegar and love each other. Based on stories we know, Rhaegar seems to be a good guy. He loves Lyanna as he sacrificed his best men, Arthur Dayne's army to defend Lyanna instead of joining him in the BoTrident. However, the outcome MAY be different if Lyanna declared her love to Rhaegar. Just maybe. Do you believe in this theory?

2. Why did Grandmaester Pycelle tell the Mad King to trust Tywin? Jaime told the Mad King not to trust his father and I think it's more credible to think that Jaime knows Tywin the best among them. Varys is the Master of Whisperers too. Anyway, so what is Pycelle's intentions? He clearly plays the game as we know that his ploy is to appear weak and harmless to everyone.

3. Is Jon Arryn a far more important character than Ned Stark? He was the Hand of the King instead of Ned. As we know, Ned would've been a great Hand if he lasted longer. Plus Westeros was stable for 17 good years. I guess my answer is yes but I thought that he is being portrayed as a far less important character than he really is.

4. Not related to the rebellion but just to clarify, Cersei is betrothed to Rhaegar until Aerys opposed and asked Elia Martell instead, right? That is why Tywin didn't stay loyal to the realm and stayed neutral until a clear side has won.

5. When the Mad King died, there were only 3 people in the room? Jaime, Aerys, and the Pyromancer? I find it odd. If not, what did the others in the room say?

6. Robert was able to be the king because of his Targaryen blood. Is it a big of a deal? If it was a rebellion, I assume everything is in chaos a new dynasty should be born instead. If he became the king because he was the one who led the rebellion, I would understand.

7. Is it safe to assume that the war is between Baratheon/Stark/Tully/Arryn and Targaryen/Martell/Tyrells? If Lannisters then sided with the Targaryens, what would be the outcome?

8. Why didn't Robert marry Catelyn or Lysa instead? I know Robert hates the Targaryens but marrying a Lannister? I guess Tywin played the game perfectly by pretending to be a big help for the rebels.

I'll add more. I just forgot some of my questions. You may add your questions too.

Tyrion's story would be spoiled if it turns out his dad is actually someone else and suddenly he can ride dragons.

Similarly, I think if the series ending centred on dragons vs the white walkers, it would be boring. Why? Because all the humans would have to drop their grievances and come together. 

This would be bad for one reason - why was Brienne and the Hound's fight so brutal watch? Besides the obvious ferociousness, the fact we loved *both* these characters made it hard to watch them try to murder each other.

So, with that in mind, what would be a more realistic ending? The White Walkers threatening everything until Dany and Jon on the dragons save everything or... everyone killing each other, and we watch in horror.

My theory for the ending is something like this - the White Walkers get past the Wall, and begin heading south. But, as soon as they come across Dany, she massacres them all. She saves the day quickly with dragonfire (perhaps extra dragons from Valryia pop up). For saving Westeros, she takes the throne after Cersei is deposed (another big story coming up, ala the hound and the mountain...)

But... she inherits her father's madness. She starts murdering innocent civilians, sacrificing people to her dragon. A rebellion begins, manipulated by Littlefinger. So the song of Ice and Fire... becomes Jon and Westeros fighting the fire of Dany and her army of dragons.

We have to watch our favourite characters die and kill those we love, and no-one 'wins' in the end, they just have to bury the thousand of dead. It turns out the real threat to all of the kingdom wasn't dragons or zombies or magic, just human aggression - something that George RR Martin has been writing about all along.

As the title says, I have an Arya Stark theory for the upcoming seasons, well, I say theory, but it's more like I've recently re-watched all the seasons (I've had a lot of free time) and noticed something that I haven't seen anyone talking about. So if it has already come up, I apologise for repeating it. 

In season 3, episode 6, Arya encounters the Red Priestess Melisandre for the first time, and during this meet Melisandre says something worth remembering...

""I see a darkness in you, and in that darkness eyes staring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again.""

Melisandre's visions have been proven true on several occasions at this point, so I am certain that they will meet in S7, but to whom do the eyes belong? I'm not sure, but Melisandre is on Arya's list, so I wouldn't be surprised if she is one of them.

Let me know what you think =)

While Dany was being wholly ""Good"", she almost ruined the social structure of a whole society. Once she implemented that with fear, however, she gained a balance that is perfect for rule. I believe the same goes with Jon Snow. While his father was wholly wise and good to people and laws, he failed in implementing what he believed in. Jon fights and kills many people asserting this rule, therefore implementing fear in the world around him.

Dragon fire can supposedly melt anything. So surely if they wanted break free, they could just melt whatever the chains are tethered too? Plus - it is mentioned that dragons are as smart as, if not smarter than men, so I can't imagine it would be difficult for them to figure out.

There are a number of ways to do it that its hard to choose from.

Cersei is such a great character. Manipulative, powerful, psychotic, self-righteous. But ultimately she is completely cut off from the real world and is pretty much delusional. As unlikely as it is, I am sad that we probably won't get to see Cersei witness the magnificence of the dragons or the darkness that comes with the White Walkers/Others. Just imagine as she realizes her entire existence meant nothing when she realizes there are powers such as the dragons and white walkers roaming the world, going back to that dialogue between her and Petyr. ""Power is power"". Yet Cersei herself is quite fragile.

I'm fairly certain it will be Jaime who slays the Queen soon and I can't imagine Cersei surviving to the till the end or anywhere near the end. Her story is is completely wrapped around the game of thrones. Yet the narrative will soon be taking us to a much greater and meaningful struggle.

Lannister: Jaime and it doesn't look like he's making babies with anybody. Tyrion possibly, but he might also not be Lannister.
Baratheon: No males
Greyjoy: Only Theon but he can't make babies
Stark: Bran but I assume he can't create a child
Tyrell: Loras is not interested in women
Targaryen: Technically Jon (in the book this could be much different than the show with how many Targs are possibly left)
Martell: No males left
Bolton: all dead, but possibly Sansa is pregnant?

It's a long shot but it looks like the major households of Westeros are all about to become extinct unless a few people that have no interest in creating babies do so. Or if the people allow children to bear the mother's name. ",32,10,False,self,,,,,

So we all know at the end of Roberts rebellion Jaime Lannister killed the mad king to save the city from being engulfed in wildfire. Shortly after Ned Stark stormed through the throne room doors and judged Jaime for breaking his sacred vows

Well how cool would it be if perhaps Jon Snow and daenerys team up in S7 or S8 to overthrow cersei. 

A major battle takes place in kings landing, as cersei knows she is losing she orders qyburn to set off the wildfire all around the city. Jaime then is again forced to kill cersei because of it. This time Jaime distraught from what he just did. It's Jon snow who storms through the throne room doors. But instead of judging Jaime, Jon wants to kill him for all the torment the lannisters have done to the starks past seasons.

It would bean awesome parallel and an incredibly emotional scene for viewers. Jon and Ned have had a # of parallels past few seasons so this would be a great one to add.",26,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

You know I'm rewatching the series and just watched Red wedding so I had to go and watch Walder's death afterwards to maybe feel better. I am not sure why but it just doesn't feel right. One reason I am sure of is how Arya looks like a sadistic psychopath throughout the whole thing. Specially afterwards where there is this shot of her face just looking wrong. 

Is it bad acting or bad writing? Were they trying to show joy of revenge (What the hell does that even look like?) on a babyfaced girl's face and Maisie Williams messed it up? Or was it in the script that she should look like a psychopath really in awe of watching death? Its just destroys the enjoyment of Walder dying.

Ramsay's death had a similar issue too, Sansa just enjoyed it a bit too much. I would have rather seen what was going on myself than seeing Sansa's reaction to it.

I hope this whole thing doesn't sound wrong. I know you all do it. Who doesnt go and watch Joffrey's death after Ned's death? Joffreys death is satisfying, so is Tywin's.

We know that Sansa Stark was raped multiple times by Ramsay, and she told Baelish something like she can still feel him in her. We can suppose she is pregnant, however I think that would be a poor twist, because I don't think the two last seasons will take so much months to describe this.

However, we was already shown an accelerated pregnancy, remember the red woman and the poor Renly. We also know that the red woman is not the only one with such powers, since another redhead woman appeared in Danerys storyline. Maybe these powers are related to redheads.

Imagine Sansa Stark discovering she is pregnant, and her pregnancy growing really fast, she freaks out and a Ramsey dark ghost come out! Maybe he would kill her, or Jon? (Ok, I do not imagine Jon dying like this)",12,0,False,self,,,,,

My interpretation of the prophecy is this
 ""When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves""
1) The Dothraki Grass Sea will go dry because of Dothrakis leaving to follow Daenerys in Westeros but also because winter is here and the Grass Sea will become a desert
2) When The Mountain blow in the wind like leaves refers to The Mountain being blown away by dragons / The Mountain going out of the Moon Door or The Wall being blown away by a great wind
3) The Sun rises in the West and set in the East refer to the great blow-up of King's Landing during the Battle for the Dawn when all the wildfire in King's Landing is ignited and the to people it appears the Sun is rising in the West and setting in the sea at East.

The sun part is about the last battle with the Others / Night's King / White Walkers / Wights. They descend in King's Landing after overriding any force in their path from The Wall. Or maybe they bypass everything and are ferried by a large fleet someone has.
The Unsullied and other forces in King's Landing defend the city walls and allow the citizens to escape thru the tunnels out of the city.
As the citizens get out, the Others start to get in the city and the Unsullied retreat with Daenerys (and other protagonists) inside the Red Keep. Practically all Wraiths, White Walkers and Night's King are inside the city and start attacking the Red Keep. When the Others are starting to enter the Red Keep, the wildfire in the city is ignited, annihilating the great majority of the Others but not all their leaders and a few of wraiths. 
The fight inside the Red Keep end with the biggest cache of wildfire exploding (probably by the hands of Grey Worm) wiping out the last Others. Maybe Drogon dies there igniting the fire.

And BTW, Mirri didn't prevent the Stallion That Mount The World to be born, she just moved the prophecy from Dany's child to Dany herself. She is the one burning cities (like Astapor ) and trampling nations to the grounds (like the Slaver's Cities)

As you'll know, the shows opening is spectacular, fantastic music, great animation and just down tight interesting. The thing that has intrigued me the most about it though is that it takes place within some sort of sphere or globe, and although I think they chose to stylise it like this for the sheer awesomeness of it, there may be another reason. In season 1, Robb Stark says to Bran when talking about Old Nan, ""One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named 'Macumber'."" Obviously just one of the many folk tales in the world of ice and fire, but could this also be why the opening is like this, does it (the opening only, not the story itself) take place inside a giants eye? 

Sorry again if this has been spoken about before, I'm still pretty new here

How could she survive those stab wounds? Why is the Faceless Men seemingly made up of only two people? Why did Jaqen just let her go? Why did he call her ""No One"" for kill the Waif? What was the point of this whole journey? 

I believe I've figured out the answer to all of these questions after just finishing a rewatch of the season, particularly episode 8. 

Throughout the whole series, Arya has been denying who she was. From the first, she refused to be treated like another Lady of a House. And ever since leaving King's Landing, Arya has been wayward, changing her name and identity to keep hidden while denying her true feelings about people she wants to believe she hates, like the Hound. 

Arya's training with the Faceless Men was originally intended for her to be a place she could go, for she believed there was nowhere else for her. She wanted to train in becoming an assassin so she could kill her enemies. 

But Arya Stark is too strong an identity to wash away, and her witnessing Lady Crane's performance as Cersei Lannister put things back into perspective for her. And with the knowledge she gained from her training, Arya now has the skills to fight against those who wronged her family. 

But we know all that. What you're interested in is the Faceless Men's side of things. 

Even after spending so much time with them, we and Arya know so little about this organization of assassins. Like why is there only two people? Well, I believe that there are many Faceless Men, but we only see the Waif because she, like Arya, is another trainee, and Jaqen, because he is an instructor. 

But what about everything else? Why does Jaqen let Arya go? Why was he seemingly pleased about it?

The sequence in 'The Door', where the Waif beats up Arya and then Jaqen gives her a mission, put everything into perspective for me. 

After the Waif knocks her down, she tells Arya, ""You will never be one of us."" 

Jaqen then says, ""She has a point."" 

If Jaqen believes this, then why does he bother training Arya? I believe, and this is my theory, but I believe that Jaqen knew Arya would never stop being herself; she has too much baggage to just up and drop for a cause she herself never believed in, only wanted to use as a means to an end. 

I think this is also why Jaqen sent Arya on this particular mission. To put things back into perspective for her, to see a troupe of people pretending to be someone else. In Jaqen's mind, there would be two outcomes to this mission: either Arya would truly join the Faceless Men and become No One, or she would regain her identity as Arya Stark of Winterfell. 

""One way or another, a face will be added to the Hall."" 

Killing the Waif and taking her face proved that Arya's training paid off, and she could become an accomplished assassin. But, rather than accepting this fate, Arya declares who she is, to which Jaqen smiles knowingly and grants her leave. And Lady Crane died anyway, so the debt to the Many Faced God is paid. 

This, I believe, is the point of Arya's story arc in season 6 - regaining her identity, remembering what she was fighting for. Jaqen is smart, and I believe he was aware of the futility of trying to erase Arya Stark, but he saw the benefit in training her so brutally. He effectively made her into a killing machine, which we see in action in the finale. 

Without a doubt, we will see the Faceless Men again in season 7. But as it stands, after putting all of this together, I like how layered Arya's story was in the sixth season. 

No, don't get me wrong, it's still dumb that she survived those wounds and did all that moving around. I accept it as a product of drama and film; I don't have to like it, but I accept it. If anything, it at the very least gave the Waif some character. And I did not care too much that Arya let herself be ambushed, because it's stupid to think she should be on high alert of everyone around her right after leaving the play - she was not even aware that the Waif was spying on her in the first place, she couldn't have expected such an immediate reaction. 

Though, from the incredible acting on Maise's part, Arya is incredibly wary of everyone around her after this encounter. And the Waif's brutality and desire to make Arya suffer was her own undoing. I, personally, am willing to let what should be a fatal stab wound pass if we get that kind of subtle character and storytelling. 

Anyway, hope I shed some light with a new perspective on this storyline, because I feel it gets an unjust amount of hate.

My question is: Why does this happen?  Why did Rickard send his middle child away from Winterfell to be raised by another man?  Why was Robert Baratheon sent away from the Stormlands to be raised by Lord Arryn?  Was there a benefit for Lord Rickard and Lord Baratheon?

Tyrion says something along the lines of ""There was a mutiny, above the Wall. He was killed by his own men."" As far as I remember, thats the last mentioned of it. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my question is this, could this be a source of conflict between Jorah and Jon if they ever meet? Consider Jorah's perspective. All he knows is there's a new Lord Commander, shortly after the mutiny that killed his father. ""Hey Jon, weren't you on that above-the-Wall trip?"" He likely also won't ignore the fact that Jon is the son of Ned Stark, who ran Jorah out of the North in the first place.

&amp;nbsp; 

Now, this problem could be solved by leaning over to just about anyone and asking ""Psst, did that guy kill my dad? I'm pretty sure he's holding my sword."" And pretty much anyone in the Night's Watch/North would say ""No. Your dad loved him, and Jon actually avenged him while you were off chasing tail.""
And Jorah would say ""Oh ok. Fair enough. Still my sword though.""
But there is an awful lot of events during GoT that could have been solved by someone just asking a question and then believing the answer, so I don't see this as outside the realms of possibility. ",26,37,False,self,,,,,

I apologise if theres any potential spoilers for future episodes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5f4t20/everything_i_think_i_may_have_a_theory_on_the/,pm_me_your_dark_side,1480243960,"Im not sure if this has been said before or its a well known possibility, just thought it would be a cool discussion. So basically I believe that the faith of the seven are literal people, people that will be revealed as the saviours of Westeros in the future story and maybe the big ending to the great story.

Some how the idea of the seven gods gets implanted into the minds of people centuries ago, 
now that weve seen that Bran can have a major influence in past events why couldn't he be the one to do this? He has a direct quote saying, ""The Seven is a single deity with seven aspects, each representing a different area of life. But most people refer to the Seven as separate gods.
Could this sentence mean a whole lot more?

So when it comes to the seven theres the father, the mother, the maiden, the crone, the warrior, the smith and the stranger, all these aspects seem to reflect a lot of main characters.

Weve been following Samwell Tarley for a hell of a lot of story time to not be really important to the outcome of the story,  he may even be the most important character, hes protected Gilly and her baby and refused to leave their side, why is Gilly and the baby even a part of the story? Because Sam is the father.

The mother represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as ""the strength of women, Daenerys targaryen the mother of dragons fits this description perfectly.

Sansa stark could represent the maiden, love, purity and beauty, the purity aspect might debunk this however.

The crone is an interesting one, a wise ugly old lady with foresight and wisdom, makes me think of that Melisandre scene at the end of episode one season six, why did that even have to be in the story? Why so old and ugly? Because she's the crone.

John Snow the warrior, there are a few people that the warrior could very well be however Id like to think he is the ultimate warrior rising up through the ranks of the nights watch to eventually defeat the white walkers and save the day.

If Gendry every returns on his little boat he would be the obvious candidate for the smith, will he come back and be a bigger character than originally thought? 

Lastly theres the stranger, quite an obvious one in my opinion, the stranger represents death and depicted in a number of different forms, sometimes having no face at all, Im not even gonna say it.

So at the end of the day all these people would have a massive part to play in saving everyone from the long winter and the white walkers, so much that Bran has them represented as gods to insure the faith that one day the people will survive the long winter.

Seems to me and a lot of other people that she is looking pretty fucked right now. I've been thinking that her only solid allies seem to be her fellow Westerlanders after the Sept fiasco. However thinking about it now I'm not so sure. Some of the shit she's pulled to make them possibly abandon her includes.

- Killed a powerful, influential and respected member of House Lannister and the Hand of the King in Kevan. The fact that he was in her family also makes her a kinslayer, another big no-no.

- Killed his son Lancel (even though he was a religious fanatic this is something I can't imagine they'd be fine with). Kinslayer again.

- Destroyed the alliance House Lannister had with probably the most powerful house in Westeros, the Tyrells. After all of the Wars and financial strains the Lannisters, and by extension the Westerlands, are under now this was an alliance they desperately needed.

- This one I'll admit could be a bit of a stretch. But I don't think it would be crazy for them to believe she had Tommen killed so she could take the throne. All they know is that she blew up the Sept and at the same time Tommen fell to his death from the Red Keep, no one else knows it was suicide and it would be very easy to suggest she had him killed. This added to the fact that she also killed the beloved Queen and then almost immediately had herself crowned only serves the exacerbate this idea. We know it's untrue but the Westerlands Lords don't.

- This next one is a bit of future speculation so may not come to fruition. A lot of people think that she will ally with Euron. It is essentially the only alliance either of them can make at this point so could happen. While I think Euron may try to make this happen, I doubt Cersei will. She wants all the power for herself and essentially hates any man who isn't Jaime (even that's debatable now) so I can't see her agreeing to marry him. However if this did happen, the Westerlands Lords would be pissed, being that the Westerlands have always been a prime target for Ironborn raiders.

Her only saving grace seems to be that Jaime is at least semi-respected and may be able to keep the Westerlands on her side. However with the Wars to come, everyone can clearly see that this isn't a war they can win.

Do you think this means that her only allies are the Crownlands? I don't even think she has those so is she even more fucked than a lot of people are giving her credit for?",47,39,False,self,,,,,

Continuing my rewatch of Season 5, today me and the mrs covered Season 5, episode 9 'The Dance of the Dragons'. You know, the one where Shireen gets nice and toasty. I'm sure this has been covered a lot before, but it still really bugs me...why couldn't Melisandre just leech her?
I know Stannis asks Mel in the previous episode, but she just waves it off. But why? Why goddam you??

&amp;nbsp;

Firstly, let's just consider what three little leeches did with ole Gendry (in the belief they actually did anything at all).
1. Killed Robb Stark, a King in good health with hundreds of loyal men around him, half the distance of Westeros away.
2. Killed Joffrey Baratheon, a King in good health with a King's guard and an army in the nation's capital.
3. (In the books anyway) Killed Balon Greyjoy, surrounded by sea, the entire width of Westeros and some very high rocks.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's consider what Melisandre asks of Shireen's blood in the show:
1. Brighten it up a bit.
(Yes, and a bit about the battle, but in fairness there's never been any indication of the kingsblood being able to turn an actual battle. Even the *cough cough* 'blood' she receives from Stannis doesn't win a battle. 

&amp;nbsp;

And that's just from a bastard, albeit a bastard with a raging hard-on, but still. This is Princess Shireen of the House Baratheon, the product of two great houses. Surely, a leech or two would have gotten the clouds to part.

&amp;nbsp;

This is before we get onto the part about Stannis being a smarter military leader to continue with this farce of a campaign, or perhaps being smart enough to see maybe his soldiers wouldn't take that kindly to watching a little girl being burnt alive, or maybe even the fact that it's burning his damn daughter alive that we're talking about.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I full well know that thanks to Roose Bolton there's been a shortage of leeches in the North for years, but come on, surely there was one or two lying around.",22,12,False,self,,,,,

Hypothetical here. If Robb Stark were alive today, had all the context behind Theon's Betrayal (Balon manipulating him, the sacking of Winterfell being that of 2 farm boys, not Bran &amp; Rickon, and the torture he has endured at the Boltons) would he still have gone through with executing him?

Personally betrayal is a big thing for me in this series. I don't think Theon wants to be forgiven, and won't ever forgive himself for turning on Robb and the Starks. However there is a clear redemption arc set in place, with him helping Sansa escape the Boltons, and rebelling against the crazed Euron.

Yes, Robb did execute Karstark for treason, despite the consequences it had. But we know Robb is still a teenager. He grew up with Theon, Theon even saved Bran's life in S1 of the show. Is there room for forgiveness?

Although this quote isn't in the show, it really is one of my favourites. 

&gt;And Robb. Robb who had been more a brother to Theon than any son born of Balon Greyjoy's loins. Murdered at the Red Wedding, butchered by the Freys. I should have been with him. Where was I? I should have died with him.

They go as follows: 

The North - This includes Robb and Catelyn material, Bolton stuff, and Jon's army 

The Wall - pretty self-explanatory - anything that has to do with the Wall. Sam's season 6 plot counts. 

King's Landing - Any batch of storylines that take place within King's Landing. But you cannot pick one factor, such as Tyrion's season 3 plot alone, it must be the whole thing. 

Across the Sea - Anything taking place here. Tyrion's season 5 plot and Dany's season 5 plot will be counted as separate, because they're both large chunks of story. 

For me: 

The North - Season 2; I love the drama with Theon this season when he attempts to hold Winterfell. Catelyn has a lot of great scenes this season. Robb's story is better in season 3, but the other aspects I listed place this above Season 3's overall Northern material. 

The Wall - Season 5. I wasn't too crazy about this story when I first watched it; in fact, I liked season 4's Wall storyline a heck of a lot more. But I rewatched it recently, and I really dig the interesting position it puts Jon in - he didn't want to have power in the first place, and then it's thrust upon him. Interesting to see him try and make both his men happy and do the right thing by saving the wildlings. The last four episodes of season 5 really ramp up the tension in this storyline, and I'm not just talking about the phenomenal White Walker attack. 

King's Landing - Season 6. Honestly, it was hard to pick between any of the seasons. King's Landing always has my favorite plot lines of each season, from the intrigue of Ned, and us, figuring out the game in the first season, to Tyrion's politic-plays in season 2, the subtle scheming in 3, Tyrion's trial in 4, Cersei's epic rise and fall in 5. 

But I have to give it to season 6. The High Sparrow is one of my personal favorite characters, and seeing him outwit everyone just by being himself is incredible. Speaking of incredible, how crazy is it when you look at the end of season 1, and Cersei is on top of the world, and then by episode 8 of season 6 she has only the Mountain to protect her, and even that is stripped away. And of course, the events that transpire all culminate in the biggest game-changer since the Red Wedding. 

Across the Sea - Season 3. It's just a treat to watch Dany use her wits and reputation to win over the first two slaver cities.

""There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness fall heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, The Red sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him"".

Daario was Bron Again admits salt and smoke when either he changed sides from Yunkai to Dany's side the salt being from Dany's bath and the smoke from the candles lighting the tent. Or In episode 4 of last season when he witness dany come out of a burning smoking hut and in the dothraki sea and sea has salt.

Darkness gather and the dread hour is most likely either the white walkers coming or Cersei reign as Mad queen.

In the legend it is said that Azor Ahai had to stabbed the heart of his beloved wife Nissa Nissa to forge Lightbringer this means Daario has to kill dany with his sword in order to forge the blade Lightbringer and in this way he would have the blood of the dragon as the blood would be on his sword from either killing Dany or having to kill one of her dragons.

I have not made a strong connection to Awakening dragons from stones yet that is the only thing i have going against him but there are still two seasons and two books left so he still has alot of time to fulfill that part of the prophecy

Finally the red star bleeding i think he was most likley like everyone in westeros he was under the red comet so he would fit that part as well.

This means that it is possible that Daario Nahaeris could be Azor Ahai Reborn",12,0,False,self,,,,,

Sensibility-wise, she's you're average mother, so I'm a little worried about what I'm getting her into. To me, season 2 is the gnarliest season, what with all of its father-daughter incest, monsters coming out of vaginas, babies being stabbed, semen dripping off of whore's chin, rat-based torture, ect. I know season 1 was plenty gory and rapey and other seasons had bad stuff too, but I just feel like season 2 was the one that was most jam packed with stuff that would disgust the average TV watcher.

I'm sure there are plenty of people here who have tried to get their friends and family into the show but worried that the rough stuff might scare them off before they have a chance to become truly invested in the story and characters. Did any of you feel like you had to issue any sort of disclaimer before lending out DVDs or HBO passwords? A sort of ""Hey I know it starts kinda gross, but stay with it"" type of thing?

P.S.: This is not at all meant to sound elitist or condescending to those who can't stomach the show. The show is objectively pretty tough to watch at times. Honestly, I'm glad she's just borrowing the DVDs and that I'm not watching it *with* her, because sex/rape scenes are never fun to watch with your mommy lol.",11,0,False,self,,,,,

The first Wildlings must have just been unfortunate people who were on the wrong side of the construction project.

There's obvious speculation that he will join the Brotherhood Without Banners, but what exactly would that mean?

Would he strap on a new suit of armor and return to full-on badass? Will he run into Arya again? Sansa maybe? Or will the Lord of Light somehow give us CLEGANEBOWL? I'd like to hear some opinions on the matter.

1. Arya is back home at Winterfell like i said and meanwhile before the big battle Dany stats to Gendry that they must marry in order to end war with the baratheons and Targaryens. Gendry not really wanting to marry Dany decides to take a boat to Winterfell when he gets there he has a reunion with Arya similar to the reunion between Jaime and Cersei in season 3.

2. Arya decides she is not able to go back to the life she once had due to being gone for so long and changing alot and decides to leave and take a boat to King's landing and when she gets there she meets up with Gendry and they have there reunion and they both decide to sneak into king's landing to kill Cersei.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

TL; DR some nonsense.

I have seen the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwjvDY5F_1I) of the encounter of Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister in the first episode of the first season. 
 and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FbdNu2dvuw) of the encounter of Jamie Lannister and Jon Snow in the second episode of the first season. 
In S1E1, Tyrion annoys Jon calling him bastard several times in a row. In S1E2  Jamie annoys Jon with some ironies about swords, killing other men with a sword, and the Night Watch (in this case, note that the blacksmith is forging the sword of Arya, Needle).

I think that we will see a repetition of these scenes with different roles.
Suppose Jon learns about his parents Lyanna and Raeghar, with some hard proof involved (a witness, some letter or a dragon magically recognizing Jon as a Targaryen). Then Jon is a heir to the Iron Throne, and Tyrion is the killer of his own father. Note that it is possible that Jon will not return the puns of S1E1, just to mark a difference.

Also, I believed that Jon will see Jamie killing Cersei, matching the scene when Ned found Jamie killing the mad king. However, I think that Jon will kill Jamie, stabbing his heart, and tempering his sword with a lion blood. Remember Needle? It is a sword  tempered in water.

Mother-Dany, the mother of Dragons


Warrior-Jaime Lannister, this guy is probably the most famous warrior alive in Westeros, even though he only has one hand now



Maiden-Sansa, she isn't a maiden, but she acted like one throughout much of the story.


Smith-Gendry, the blacksmith



Crone-Cersei, she is an old witch at this point, maybe not Lena Headey, but in the books Cersei is not described as beautiful anymore and lots of people comment on her age.




Stranger-Arya the faceless woman




My theory involves the fact that the Faith of the Seven is actually talking about 7 people who are going to save Westeros. Bran goes back in time and implants the idea of the faith of the 7 in the Andals heads. That way, when it came time for Jaime, Dany, Jon, Sansa, Gendry etc to call for the support of all of Westeros to fight the Other, the common people following the faith would be more willing to answer the call, and Sept leaders would be able to proclaim the 7 are on earth and you have to follow them to death.



Bran knew the people would fight harder if they believed they were on a holy crusade fighting for their gods.

He then said: Maybe they represent two different timelines where humanity is doomed in each case, from white walkers in one reality and dragons in the other.
Bran could have sent himself back to weave the two tales together to ensure survival for humanity.

First of all, if I'm breaking any rules (I would understand how this discussion wouldn't be related to GoT) please just pm me if I can fix it.

Crowfall is a pc game which is currently on alpha, and is a combination of mmorpgs and strategy games. The interesting thing is that the game draws a lot of inspiration of Game of Thrones.
Basically, players can form factions and alliances, but they could also betray each other. Resulting in thousands of players participating in politics and warfare. This all happens while literally, winter is coming. The servers live a span of 1-6 months and begins in spring, players can interact with each other in economics, politics and more. Until winter has come and the server ends.

The creators used the world of GoT as an inspiration, and a few characters also feel similar (the assassin with the faceless man) 

""The Farewell Kiss is swift and painless. We are not monsters, after all. No one needs to suffer.

Some mothers cry. Some plead for asistance. My mother did neither.

For generations, this has been our practice. For generations, we have known peace.""

Furthermore they talk alot about crows, wolves and more.
Personally,  the fact that I can pretend to be a common man, and manipulating people in my faction until I take over power, fight other powers, and ruling over all after months of work sounds like a perfect game, a game of thrones.


So TL;DR: I can see how GoT fans would really like this game as a form of Roleplaying, and thought it would be interesting to see what GoT fans think about this. Would you be interested in games like this where you could experience a bit of what GoT characters feel on a more rawer scale?",4,5,False,self,,,,,
