We love all the discussion going on, and absolutely love the increase in those deciding to read the books. It's an adventure you should definitely look into.

All that being said, there has been a drastic increase in *comments* that have required moderation. Specifically comments of a suggestive nature toward the cast and potential cast of the show, as well as toward other Redditors. 

As a result of this, we've come to a decision that those in violation of this policy will be banned without warning. Consider this your warning to avoid posts of such a nature.

Let me be clear that bans on this subreddit are *not permanent* if addressed in a mature fashion. Those who haven't read the posting policy, new posters, or those without a history of posts like these will have reason to call their ban into question with the mod staff. We will review each of these on a case-by-case basis and decide if the person will benefit the community or cause further problems down the road. 90% of these will be the former.

Let me also be clear that ""I'm 16 so it's cool"" doesn't matter. We don't care how old you are or how old the age of consent is in your country. Posts that are of a suggestive nature toward ***ANY*** member of the cast or future cast will be met with the same actions. I don't care of it's Old Nan or Arya, all comments of this nature will be moderated, and the posters banned.

There's been talk and reviews of season two, people have made comparisons and done what they can to point out the differences between books and the show. But thinking about it, it could be that even while they were stalling and sputtering with the development of Arya, Their intentions were specifically placed on Tywin?
I haven't gotten so far into the books to know for myself without being told, but obviously a lot of people die. Screen time used properly can maximise the viewer's feelings to what they're watching. And with so many more of those who watch the show looking at Tywin for thematic effect on the grand scheme, whatever other parts down the road are going to be built up massively.
[Book Spoiler(/b Obviously, Tywin dies, and the drama unfolding towards those parts is strong enough in it's own way.)] They didn't darken Arya so much as staying true to the books would have, But Tywin isn't so much of a malicious money counting prick as he is a Stalwart and militarist commander as well.
Placing their pieces on the board in similar manners but with slightly varied movements can make or break the show in the reader's eyes, mayhaps the viewer's as well, but seeing what they've done so far leads me to trust them rather than nitpick. 
Personally, if it wasn't for how cruel he was to his own blood, I'd have favored Tywin from the get go. May the gods grant him a glorious and honorable death [Book Spoiler(/b or rather, may the writer's and actor's play it to proper justice)]",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I find him addicting, and I think its mainly because he's one of the only characters who is able to escape the confines of the world's ""social context.""  Clearly, a dwarf thriving on intellectual ability despite overwhelming odds is very countercultural.

Literally everyone else is enslaved by their values or environment--for example, Ned seem exceptional in his righteousness, but when you consider how overbound by honor he is, you realize that he's ""enslaved"" just like everyone else.  Arya, however, might be another along this ""free"" thread.

I finally decided to switch the sides from reading to posting, because I deeply need your help in this particular case :-).
Yesterday I heard that some filming locations for Season 3 will take place in Morocco (e.g. Marakesh) and that filming will start around the end of July. I'm travelling to Morocco for three weeks in october. It would be plain awesome to visit the set if I just could get any clue where it will be :-).
Do any of you have an idea where to find information about an issue like that? I sneaked through google for hours without success and would appreciate any hint!
Thanks in advance!",6,7,False,self,,,,,

1) Why did Tywin decide to set up his forces at Harrenhal for a bit (prior to going to Kings Landing at Battle of Blackwater)? Was it occupied by anyone beforehand? If so, what happened to them? Did the Lannisters drive them out to occupy it?

2) As far as I can tell, Harrenhal is just a smoking ruin. Yet, it was offered as a reward to Janos Slynt and Littlefinger. Why? Is it better than nothing?

My idea was if we took the world map from GoT and created an interactive version of it.  

I thought it would be really cool and beneficial to viewers/readers if there was a way they could access an interactive map where they could drag or somehow add the main and important characters and also banners onto the cities of the map.  This would allow readers to easily keep track of where characters are and the control of all cities.  That way, everyone would be able to customize the map however they need to because everyone is at different points in different books and even for show viewers they could update it each episodes and have a clear understanding of where characters are.  

This was just an idea I had that I thought would be really cool, especially if we could add it to the sub! I dunno how complicated this is to create, but I figured with the help of the Mods and everyone on here that we could get it done!

I hope everyone realizes I'm not getting karma from this, so I would really appreciate that if you think it's a good idea, to upvote for attention! I'd love for the mods, and people with computer skills to see this! Otherwise, feel free to add anything that you believe would build off of or improve my idea! 

**TL;DR** What if we could create an interactive map that allows people to individually keep track of where major characters are and who controls each city. That way everyone can individually update it based on where they are in the books or television show and have a clear view and understanding of where characters are in relevance to the whole map and could update it as the move along.

His father is from the ""House of Drculeti"" (in english : House of the dragons). His surname was Dracul (English: Dragon) and was inducted into the Order of the Dragon.

Vlad III was exiled after trying to take the throne, and came back later with the army of another king to conquer it (with success).

He was known for his damn high level of cruelty and was a sort of ""mad king"". To the point that he sickened a Turkish Sultan and his army with 20'000 impaled corpse of his own people [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler#Reputation_for_cruelty)

I think there is some more point related to the house Targaryen

And i am disappoint....

really, really disappointed. the writing is great. i love the one-liners and the dialogue. love the tension, all that. but i've completely lost that sense of impending triumph that keeps me reading books like this. i finished the book and was depressed for days. i'm all about having a hard path to follow to make it to the end, but if there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel, there isn't a point of reading the damn books.

at this point my favorite character chapters are Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister. all the other characters are just retarded(jon snow i'm lookin at you) or/and get killed off in retarded ways for retarded reasons(jon snow i'm still lookin at you). jon snow FAILED. he failed himself and he failed his brothers of the watch. after spending an entire book standing up to stannis and holding to his oaths and to the nights watch, he recieves a letter and decides to go galloping south to rescue his sister. i hope to god he's really dead because he's betrayed the watch. if he's just unconcious and the melisandre or something brings him back, i'll be pissed. he failed his test.

every other character except for arya seems to be in a holding pattern of stupidity while the whole world waits for winter to set in or something. at least arya is accomplishing something by training with the faceless.

Daenerys got me too. The Mother of Dragons, The Khaleesi, The Stormborn. i thought she was done being meek, but all through this book she reminded me of how she was before drogo, all tame and weak, hardly ever showing her claws. there's some slight hope of redemption with her goign back to the dothraki at the very end when she's riding Drogon, but it leaves off at the meeting and you don't know whether they're going to try to take her prisoner or serve her. i long for the day we see the dragons in combat. preferably on the wall, with the watch, toasting Other's like marshmallows. it's about all that's keeping my interest in these books alive.",21,0,False,self,,,,,

More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. Theyve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.  
&gt;
&gt;Then they get a taste of battle.  
&gt;
&gt;For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after theyve been gutted by an axe.  
&gt;
&gt;They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when thats still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.  
&gt;
&gt;If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands theyre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there its just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They dont know where they are or how to get back home and the lord theyre fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world . . .  
&gt;
&gt;And the man breaks.  
&gt;
&gt;He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them . . . but he should pity them as well.

I think it's quite interesting to share our views on this, so it probably deserves some more attention. So this is like, you know, a cross-comment/post. I don't get any karma from a text post, I'm honestly curious about your theories.

Once someone pointed out that Mormonts are ""Scottish"" (with Bear Islands somehow being Scotland), I started to notice a lot of stuff like that:

* Targaryens - the -aryen part = Aryans. Bright hair, weird methods, cruelty, secret weapons (hint: the dragons). We're dealing with Westeros Nazis here.
* Braavos being a mixture of Greece and Italy (the obvious Titan of Braavos/Colossus of Rhodes, hundreds of islands, names of the characters)
* Dorne being a ""creole"" of Spain and Morocco (or generally North Africa)
* Greyjoys remind me of Scandinavians (tough, pragmatic guys with a great navy, with lands that force them to pillage, loot and plunder)
* I always connected Tyrells to the French, a kind of ""softer"", more elegant people, whose military is actually one of the best, both in our world and in Westeros
* Qarth, with its riches, is Persia, the Dothraki are Mongol riders (Khan/Khal, so transparent), the Great Pyramid of Meereen instantly brings an image of Egypt (though this should be on the third continent, aside from Westeros, Essos and Sothoryos)
* Starks and Lannisters are based on the families of York and Lancaster, from the War of the Roses, but in all of our love and hate for both of them (pick yours accordingly), I tend to think of Starks as the good Brits, and Lannisters as the handsome, rich, powerful Germans (more like Prussians than the crazy-Nazi-German Targaryens)

From what we can gather from the show and the book, days last about as long as they do on our earth. They have one sun, and one moon like we do. Also, the year is basically the same too. Sansa gets her period around her 13 or 14th name day...basically when most women do. So the planet in the book/show is pretty much identical to our earth. I know that seasons have less to do the distance from the sun, and more with the angle of the earth toward the sun...the earth's vertical wobble.

Here's a bit of history behind The Wall, as well as some insight into current/future books.

The Wall is at least 700 feet high. To put it in perspective, that's about as tall as [4 Cinderella's Castles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_Castle) in Disney World. While this isn't even close to the tallest building in the world ([Burj Khalifa in Dubai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa)) or even the tallest in the US ([Willis Tower in Chicago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower)), it is still quite a feat considering the period in question.

The Wall is also 300 miles long, spanning [roughly the distance from Connecticut to DC](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;gl=us&amp;saddr=connecticut&amp;daddr=Washington+DC&amp;dirflg=d&amp;geocode=KaVREfIRU-aJMeVwYQVbbZqu%3BKVvk9lrexreJMSpdiNQiRVLC&amp;ei=vrD1T5KmB4Ha6wGf0NnXBg&amp;ved=0CAUQ9w8wAA). 

It is sandwiched between two of the roughest seas in Westeros, [The Bay of Seals](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bay_of_Seals), and the [Bay of Ice](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bay_of_Ice). Both of these are notoriously difficult to traverse. The Bay of Seals is even rumored to be home to serpents and mermaids leading to Skaagos, home of unicorns (not the nice kind) and cannibals.

In [ASOS](/b ""Jarl is tasked with climbing the wall along with Styr to get to the Night's Watch. In the process, The Wall actually breaks off underneath them and a sheet of ice plummets to the ground, killing Jarl and the rest of his climbing party."") ([Source](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jarl))

And finally, we have the magical properties associated with The Wall. Many believe it to be imbued with magical powers, giving The Wall the ability to ""defend itself"". There are spells that ward magical creatures from being able to pass it, as well as spells to strengthen the actual structure. 

And now I open the floor to questions/discussion on The Wall and what's so special about it!",40,19,False,self,,,,,

The Faith of the Seven is already a major political and social power in the realm, prevalent everywhere throughout Westeros and even present, though not necessarily powerful, across the narrow sea. Till this point, from what I can tell, the holy septons and, especially, the High Septon have generally followed whatever will the crown has made known. However, with the new High Septon and the rebirth of the faith's military arm, I foresee the next major struggle for power not being house vs house or king vs king but realm/king vs the faith and those unsworn to the church who stand with the faith. 

If this is the case, that makes things even worse for Dany as she travels back to Westeros (eventually) because up till this point she's had it in her head that she needs Westerosi allies and houses to declare for her to sow dissension and create division in the realm. She has her Unsullied army and her free army, but she'll still need the support of the Westerosi to gain King's Landing. This, potentially, changes the whole game for her since she won't be coming to fight several different houses united under a vague and hastily patched-together alliance but, instead, may be facing a single army under a single ruler. 

Things could get pretty interesting seeing how the social/political landscape shifts in Westeros between the Faith, the Maesters, and the houses during the next few books. This is all assuming, of course, that the Wall stands strong and the Others don't get all stabby stabby.

The Red Wedding was Robb and his lesser lords reaping what they sewed.

1. None of the Lords gave Walder any respect. They refused to marry his children or visit him.

2. Walder Frey had no reason to go vendetta mode for Ned Stark and The Lannisters did not attack his part of the riverlands. But he still decided to put his neck on the line for Robb because Robb promised him his daughter would be a queen. Walder betrays his rightful king on the Iron Throne (at least in his mind) for a bunch of rebels who brought this on themselves by attacking Tyrion and being too obvious in Kings landed.

3. Robb comepletely fails at being king, loses bannermen, bargaining chip, his homeland. Basically he isn't much better than Viserys at this point.

4. Robb gets married to some woman he just met to protect ""her"" honour over his. Probably without thinking of the honour of the Freys.

5. The army of the North ignores Walder until they are in desperate need to go back to the North. They contact him.

6. Walder notices that the war is pretty much lost for the North, Robb and his mother are incompetant and don't care about his honour, and that Bolton and Lannisters are willing to deal with him. SO he makes the wise decision to go on the side he probably would have if not for Robb's lies.

7. Walder realizes that it is more humane to kill a dozen men at the wedding instead of a drawn out war with the ""King in the North"" losing family members and people he loved so he does that. If they didn't respect his honor why should he honor them at the wedding?

8. Walder swears fealty to the Lannisters and they actually follow through with their promises.


In my opinion Walder Frey was just looking out for his family. There was pretty much no reason to ally with Robb Stark. Robb was an incompetent leader, didn't show any respect to important bannermen (Frey, Karstark, and Edmure Tully), didn't think things through, lost his homeland, and was the most hated by the other kings (Balon Greyjoy hated him for Neds actions, Stannis hated him for being a usurper, at least Joffrey wasn't knowingly a usurper, and the Lannisters hate the Starks a lot). Walder Frey made the right call.

**TL;DR Walder Frey is actually a pretty cool guy**",35,0,False,self,,,,,

Anyway besides speculation of the prophecies, lineage, and which family will finally sit the throne; one of my favorite things to think about is not only which marriages are likely to happen but which would you most want or which you'd despise?

*i've read all the books so that's where my perspective is from

[ADWD Couple 1](/b ""Salt+Fire. My favorite character since the demise of good ole' Robb is Victorian Greyjoy who is just completely badass and honest to his Ironborn sense of honor. Therefore, I would love to see him and Dany pair up, which to me seems like a perfect match. To her, he is an exciting ""fire"" of a husband extremely similar to Drogo actualy and a brilliant leader. To him, she is his ""prize"" of beauty etc. but I believe her compassion will help tame him alittle similiar once again to Drogo. However, I'd like to see them not set sail for Westeros but rather conquer and rule Essos as my other power couples rule westeros"")

[ADWD couple 2](/b ""My ideal world has Aegon being legit and sitting on the Iron Throne. Therefore, I'd love somehow, someway for him to end up with either Stark girl. Sansa because I feel like her character has transformed alot and would be a perfect queen alongside her perfect king. Plus i despise littlefinger. However, I could also somehow see Arya and Aegon as she was the least likely to ever been a queen and it'd add alot to the story and her arc. Of course she'd have to abandon the whole psycho assasain thing. But i can see her becoming a wild beauty so basically L + R the sequel"")

I love learning everything about a universe, be it a game, book, movie series, etc. The DOOM of Valyria destroyed all the technology that the world had known at the time. I believe the doom was brought on by their magic. I believe it was the destruction of their technology. For instance, the candle (the maester saw samwell coming) that can be used for communication, like a phone. When it happened, I believed the world fell into a darkage, like the fall of the Roman Empire. They have crappy technology. The magic in GoT, might be magic, but some of it could be science and technology. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"" -Clarke's three laws I wonder if the technology still exists, the doom was only 400 years previously, they are due for a technological renaissance, and with the reemergence of dragons, the increased activity beyond the wall (the others), magic could be making a big comeback in the next books.

There's a few things that maybe hint at his relationship with Loras (Loras allegedly going ape shit after hearing of his murder and killing some of his guards and refusing to join Stannis) but that all seems kind of flimsy.  The only thing that seems really gay in the books is the fact he calls his kings guard the ""Rainbow Guard"".

Thoughts.
1. Baelish is truly an opportunistic fella. He now owns the Vale, Eyerie, Trident and Harrenhall. Not a bad pull. 
2. Tis a shame The Mount is dead. I really thought he was gonna be a bigger part of the story.
3. Sandor was truly an honest man.  
4. Just as soon as I found Oberlin Martell was going to be the Dos Equis Fella, He dies arrogantly. 
5. Maergery has no damn luck, 2 Weddings and still a virgin. Sounds like a sitcom from the CW. 

Opinions
1. The Red Wedding seemed justified. If only the Karstarks had more of a hand in it. Robb was showing signs of being a poor king prior. 
2. Sansa has plenty more price to pay for selling her dad down the river. Remember if it wasn't for her he may still be alive.
3. The Freys are one jacked up family. Talk about putting the fun in dysfunctional.
4. Cercei really has no saving grace does she. I cannot think of anyone that still thinks high of her but herself.
5. Marillion deserves all that is coming his way. 

Speculation
1. Arya is going to run into Nymeria again. That is who she is when she is dreaming and that will be a fun reunion. 
2. Hot Pie is given a lordship and ownership of the Inn. I know it is less than likely to happen but for some reason I like that guy. 
3. Tyrion shall become an Honorary Martell. He may actually stay and hide in the Red Keep now that he knows the tunnels. That would be awesome. 
4. Bran will kill Jojen. I don't know how but man I just don't like that guy. 
5. Theon shall show back up at some point and claim the Iron Islands as his own.

Cersei becoming victim to her own ignorance was delicious.  Reading her chapters was like watching a train wreck with a train you didn't like, it was enjoyably frustrating how many mistakes she was making.  Jamie while starting out the series as a dick is one of the more likeable characters now and I am interested to see what happens with him.  I didn't really like the Martell/Dorne sections until the very end when you find out that Prince Doran is keeping Dorne out of the war because he is trying to bring the Targeryans back.  That was a masterstroke in my opinion and now I love the Martells (Especially Oberyn, he was harsh).  But for me, my favourite character that has come out of AFFC, and possibly the whole series is Littlefinger.  The guy is an evil genius and I really can't wait to see what happens with his schemes.  Right at the end when he betroths Sansa to Jon Arryn's eventually heir was beyond genius.  The best part is, it doesn't explain what his own plans are, the stuff about Sansa's claim are just sub-schemes!

The scene pans into the Great Hall at Winterfell and Robb and Tywin Lannister are standing at opposite sides of the table, glaring at each other.  Everyone is back from the dead and standing on their respective sides of the table. They finally conclude a peace treaty and that's when the music video starts.  Let It Whip starts and everyone starts grooving and bouncing, dancing to the beats.  The royal party starts after so many years of war and death.  Foes and friends again.  We see Catelyn Stark and Jamie Lannister laughing and doing a butt bounce with one another playfully.  Tywin Lannister, smiles and moves his fingers in the air while doing an older man shuffle, Arya Stark laughing and dancing with him.  The Hound even cracks a smile and slowly shuffles with Sansa.  Even Ned Stark and Cersei Lannister dance and do a twist together.  

The camera pans around and we see minor characters also in attendance.  Meera Reed (not in the TV show) laughs and dances with a healed Bran Stark.  The camera spins around again and men-at-arms at watch can't help but shake their booties slightly to the beat.  Theon Greyjoy and some wench, perhaps Kyra laugh and try to coax Maester Luwin onto the dance floor.  The maester laughs and shakes his head ""No,"" playfully.  

The camera shoots to the front of the Hall and we see Tyrion Lannister dancing with Shae on top of a table, wine from their cups spilling around as they laugh and dance.  

Everyone is there: Lord Peter Baelish, Lord Varys, even Lord Stannis, still with a scowl but clapping his hands at least.  Hodor does a silly dance, clapping and yelling ""Hodor!""  

As the camera fades, it pulls out the keep and pans across the land showing troops from all sides having fun and dancing; Lannister and Stark, Frey and Tyrell, Tully and Baratheon.

So here's some stuff you may have missed or forgotten some details.

**Prologue related to the Final (Sam) chapter-** Awesome chapter with a young Novice called Pate who wanted to earn a golden dragon to betroth Rosey, a young girl at the citadel. 'The alchemist' is the man Pate was stealing a skeleton key (to the citadel) for. The alchemist killed Pate. **Here's the most ineteresting part In the last chapter of book4 the boy who prepares Sam's quarter is named Pate. So apparently a faceless man has taken his place.** Also the sphinx (whom is the riddle not the riddler) said out of nowhere: ""the dragon must have three heads."" Still trying to figure out how 'he' is the riddle as Aemon sputtered. 

**Ch1 ""The prophet""-** Balon Greyjoy dead via a *bridge that was destroyed during a storm*, in Pyke. There are a few theories of if a person was responsible for this. Balon's succession discussed, Aeron mentions how the green land's law doesn't hold up on Pyke meaning Asha nor Theon were to succeed their father as ruler. KINGSMOOT! (or queensmoot as we'll hear later)

**Arya's last chapter (Cat)-** Some people missed that after she drank the milk prepared by a namesless faceless man who's know as 'The Kindly Man.' She awoke blind the next morning. I'm guessing it's part of her training and she'll be able to see again in time. She had to explain what she learned each day but everything she learned was simple observation (just my lil theory but maybe others think that too).

**Brienne's last chapter-** Wow. I was so stumped why she was in shackles until they mentioned oathbreaker (Jamie's sword) and a letter signed by king Tommen. I can't believe how death has changed Cat so much... Anyone else that we saw who was brought back seemed docile and without much attachment to their former life. Cat is scorn incarnate. Bitterness turned black. Her shredded skin has more humanity than she does, or so it seems. I loved how Cat pointed out a red-wedding-participant early in book4 but I cannot believe how she is treating Brienne. Cat's time for thought and contrition are over apparently. She was never a beloved character to me, but she was loved by characters I love so that was enough. (This next bold part is taken from towerofthehand.com)**Harwin (guard at winterfell) begged Thoros (a red priest) to raise her, but he would not, as it had been too long. Beric did the deed himself, and passed the flame of his life on to her. Beric died and Catelyn rose.** Shit I didn't realize this Beric guy died to let Cat live again. Beric is Lord of Blackhaven. The chapter ends with Brienne, Poderick, and her other temporary companion hanging from ropes struggling to breathe.  **""Brienne begins to choke and watches Podrick dying beside her, she musters her last strength to scream one word.** I don't know what that word was but I bet it's something that would strike home with Cat. If it's just one word it couldn't have been anything like ""They're alive"" or etc. Maybe something like ""honor"" damnit I wish they told us.


I will be typing more. I'm at work with another 2 hours to kill to stay tuned or feel free to ask questions. I'll be going through lots of chapter summaries until then.

edit:

**Elaine's final chapter-** It's incredible how Petyr knows so much historical lineage and how each one met their demise whether be a 3 year old who was kicked in the head by a horse or an old man who died of a 'bad belly.' ""**Petyr says that it is only a matter of time before sickly Robert dies and Harrold becomes Lord of the Vale**. At that time, he will marry Sansa Stark, and every knight in the Vale will rally to her to reclaim Winterfell."" There was a lot of talk about 'sweet milk' too. Which is what they give little Robert to treat his shaking. Robert loves sweet milk but it seems it will be his undo'ing the way it was discussed.

**The princess in the tower a.k.a. the most boring chapter (until the end) in the book-** Wow this chapter was worth it after we hear how ""Doran explains that he had to make a show of finding her a husband to throw off suspicion, but that she had already long been promised to another. That plan when awry when her would-be husband was killed with molten gold.1 Now Quentyn heads east to an uncertain welcome to bring back all that Doran desires: justice, vengeance, fire, and blood.""

**The Reaver chapter (Ch30)-** This is a complicated chapter for me to understand. I'm still learning their names but the two important ones are Euron and Victorian, brothers of Baleon Greyjoy. There was mention of a Dragon Egg being thrown by Euron into the sea after a wizard failed to hatch it. ""Cragorn, the man who blew the dragon horn is dead and that his lungs were charred and black with soot."" That is very interesting, I wonder if the other mythical horn that we heard of in the north also comes with consequences. Euron plans to make Danny his bride. Euron sent Victorian off to collect Dany and her dragons but Victorian plans to make her his own bride. Euron learned details of Danny from four warlocks on a Quartheen ship. He killed one warlock and fed them to the other three.. weird.

**Dragon Horn review-** This quote is from towerofthehand.com's chapter review- ""Just as a riot is about to begin, a horn blast pierces the air. All turn to look at one of Euron's crew1 sounding a shiny black horn banded with red gold and dark steel and incised with ancient Valyrian glyhps. The glyphs begin to glow as the sound goes on and on, until the man finally runs out of breath and the noise subsides. Orkwood has to catch the man and hold him up, and Aeron sees that he has blood blisters on his lips and is bleeding from his chest. Euron climbs the steps to the Grey King's hall and addresses the captains and kings. He tells them that he will bring them victory and all of Westeros. He found the horn in the smoking ruins of Valyria and says that it can bind dragons to his will. Asha points out there are no more dragons, but Euron says he knows where to find three. Lucas and the Red Oarsman begin the cry as Euron unloads his treasures for the assembled. Soon Hotho Harlaw joins in, then Gorold Goodbrother, then Erik Ironmaker until everyone is shouting Euron's name."" **It sounds like Dany might need that horn and could be destined to claim it from them. I doubt she'd Marry anyone without weeks of consultation. But she knows what she wants and makes quick decisions. Anything is possible.** [ADWD Dany's first chapter](/b ""Her black dragon murdered a young boy and then ate him, so said the man who brought the bones. Sounds like she'll need help controlling her dragons but it's really too early for me to speculate in ADWD since I'm only 5 chapters in"")

That's it for now. There are more interesting tid-bits but these are the things that I remember that peak my interest most.

I don't understand quite a few things, I will list my questions.

1) what is their motivation, the slaver said they don't want women or money or plunder of any sort... so why, why go through all of their training and abuse, for what.... what reason are they there, they live for their sword, then why do they have reason to be loyal to anything or anybody, how do you get their obedience, etc.

2) Why was Dany balking at the idea of using them? For God's sake she wanted to use a Dothraki army!! Unlike the unsullied, when they sack a city they salt the freaking earth and rape the bones of the fallen (basically)... I don't understand her motivations anymore.

3) Why is a sellsword army better than a slave army? White beard tells her to go and buy her army in sellswords.... men who can be bought in the field of battle to turn on her, as opposed to a highly trained loyal unit who would never turn in battle or against their comrades. I understand slavery is a touchy thing in westeros..... other than every lord seems to have a stable of people who wash out their bedpans, I guess they just have a different label for it.

4) Would unsullied even do well in Westeros battle tactics? Can they besiege walls and use bows? They're masters of spear and small sword/shield, but what good are they against heavily armored, horsed, and archer supplied armies? It's the same issue of using a Doth army, they're mighty in the field maybe, but against castles and full plate they really aren't as effective.

5) Why was she upset at them strangling puppies... yes it is extremely gruesome... was she not aware of what her sweet Khal and his horde were doing? Seems a wee bit hypocritical to me.

I watched the first two seasons (even had to wait for the last few episodes!) and completely fell in love.  So now I am reading through the books and honestly I think I am reading a bit slower than I normally would because I basically know all of the major plot points that will happen.  It's a bit annoying this, and in the past has actually stopped me from reading the novels of movies I have seen because I just get bored since I know what will happen.

However in this case I am quite glad I am doing it.  The characters in this series are so incredibly well developed and believable that it is very interesting to see bits of their internal monologues (perhaps that's not the term for a 3rd person writing style), and it is very interesting to see the stuff they cut out for time purposes.  It helps build backstory for the characters and helps me understand their motivations, which are not always completely explained in the episodes.

So basically what I want to say is, if you have watched the show and are on the fence about going back and reading through all of it, even knowing much of what will happen--do it. It's worth it, I promise.  I think the reason the show is so good in the first place is because they let the author be one of the producers.  This is where Hollywood is constantly shooting itself in the foot, it buys rights to a book, and completely transforms it against the will of the author into some monstrosity barely resembling the original work.  Thank you HBO for not screwing this up.

So unless you just completely hate to read or something, do yourself a favor and pick up the books!  It's easier to follow all of the characters (I for one actually watched through the show twice for this reason), and you get more insight into the characters.  Especially Tyrion.  Tyrion is just the best.

Recap of how everything stands at end of ASOS:
Catelyn is actually alive(WTF Martin stop toying with my emotions!), Robb is dead and the northern armies are fucked up, Black fish is stuck at riverun, Tywin and Joff are dead, Tyrion has escaped, Jaime seems to have a heart, Arya is on her way to Braavos, Jon snow is now lord commander, Stannis is currently at the wall. Dany is settling down at Mereen and has dismissed Mormont, Littlefinger has killed Lysa and Sansa is with him, Brienne is searching for Sansa. I think Davos is still at Dragonstone. Bran has met three-eyed raven dude

Predictions:
Arya is going to become some sort of badass via sword dancer or whatever Jorge was(face-changer assassin?). Tyrion is going to go to the free cities plot to kill Jaime and Cersei(maybe just Cersei) he might try to find Tysha. Jaime is going to do something, i just don't know what though. Cersei will end up dead because the new kings hand will be her puppet. I feel Dorne is going to become more important. Davos will continue to advise King Stannis and be a general badass. King stannis is going to start tearing shit up on his quest for the crown, starting with the ironmen who have taken over the north. He will meet Bedric dondarrion and Thoros who will then pledge themselves to the lord of light's chosen one(who i think isn't so chosen). Cat is now mute and I don't really have any idea what she might do. Littlefinger is gonna try and win Sansa over(won't work) but he'll take control of the vale and keep playing his ""game of thrones"" i think his endgame is king. Brienne will find sansa and help her out(maybe killing littlefinger). Dany is gonna chill in Mereeen for a couple years, maybe come under attack but she'll just wave her hand and they'll go away, Jon Mormont will come back and save her from one of her betrayers, i'm thinking the dario(correct name? the second sons commander guy) is the betrayer for gold, and somebody else is for love because Mormont as betray for love didn't make sense to me, he betrayed her for his homeland not cause he loved her or someone else instead of her. Lord Commander Snow will Hold The Line against the others and wights as their forces grow, maybe a couple rangings to get dragonglass, sam and co. will accompany and be with him. Robb will stay dead. Bran will become awesome wharg thing who becomes essential to battle with Others and Dany(control of Dragon?). Overall AFFC will be battles and winnings of Stannis taking over westeros to unite them against Others,  Jon will play small part in this one, Dany will do little, maybe a couple chapters of training with Arya. Shocking prediction: Hound isn't dead, Martin keeps saying this dude will die but we leave before he dies and comes back, or in the case of cat and Bedric, they outright get killed and come back

As you may or may not know, there is currently a project in the making that seeks to, in one form or another, bring the magnificent world of A Song of Ice and Fire (or Westeros at least) to the Skyrim game engine in the form of a total conversion mod. 

This noble quest has been gallantly titled *The Westeros Project*; we currently have a solid team of about eight finely talented folks, a solid plan of battle, and what vaguely resembles a sense of direction for the challenges of the future. 

But alas! We simply do not have enough finely talented folks to make this dream a reality!  So we are putting out the first of what may be a few recruitment letters, **we want your skills** for this project, whether you can contribute art (concept, texture or 3d), writing or even the soothing sound of your voice we would like to hear from you!

Anyone who is interested please send me a PM over Reddit **detailing your relevant skills** and I'll set about getting you on board.

We'll have more updates coming out in the future, where we'll be showing off screenshots from the mod as it progresses, as well as more recruitment calls if need be.

Thanks for reading.

Also, as I've said I'm only half way through so please, refrain from spoiling things outright for me :P


* So I serisouly believe Jaime is developing stockholme syndrome for Brienne, that dream he had involving her, underneath the rock in darkness. I mean how symbolic is that? His family is leagues away, he is bascially in the dark about most things going on around him (politically). At first it was Cersei who was ""the light in the darkness"" , obvisouly meaning there is nobody else in his world he wants to be with more than her, but then she slowly faded away, leaving only Brienne with him, to help fight away his ""doom"", I found that it represented the situation in his waking life. Right now there is nobody for him but Brienne. I forsee some carnal, maybe something deeper than that happeneing between the two, or at least for Jaime anyways. I know how GRRM writes dreams, he doesn't mention them for no reason.

* Daenarys' chapters keep getting more exciting, right now she just sacked Yunkai, I take it she is going to be headed to Meereen next, conquer the 3 sister slave cities, setting the slaves free. In the house of the Undying her vision told her she will suffer 3 betrayals, one for gold, one for love, and it was Mirri Maz Duur who was the first blood betrayal. I can't help but feel Jorah will somehow play into the betrayal of love...

* Who is the old woman that Beric and the brotherhood without banners sees about her dreams? I can't remember if it was already established who she was or not. Again, GRRM with the dreams that come true, she dreamt Balon Greyjoy dead, and in Catelyns chapter, low and behold, we find out it was true.

* I'm probably wrong, but I feel as if R'hillor is maybe the ""fire"" in ""A Song Of Ice and Fire"" ",46,15,False,self,,,,,

I'm normally not one to buy into more ""popular"" things (I thought the Hunger Games was a mediocre book at best, was horrified by how much the media loved it), but I recently picked up the Game of Thrones to see what all the fuss was about. Now, recently, I've haven't been reading as much as I used to. I discovered video games and the internet about 3 years ago, and while I used to be a huge bookworm, I suddenly found time to read. I thought something was wrong with me, but this book has helped me figure out that I'm really just running out of young adult books. This book completely rekindled my love for books. It might end up passing Lord of the Rings for the position of my all time favorite book. The characters are suburb, the plot is suspenseful, well done and tense and overall the book is just wonderful. I am, however, disappointed by the amount of incest in the book. Maybe there's more later, but I think there isn't a ridiculous amount of sex and incest compared to how much people talked about. 

Wow, I just read over that and I sound like a giant fanboy. I'm not, I'm really not. I'm usually highly critical of media, especially books, but The Game of Thrones blew me away. I'm also being sent to camp in a week and a half, and I plan to bring the entire series with me, so hopefully by the time I get back I'll be caught up (without computer access I get a suprising amount of reading done, heh) and I'll be able to actually participate in this subreddit's discussion. 

Erm, so anyways, just thought I would share. This is a very specific subreddit, so I figure there might be other people who enjoy this book as much as I am so far. 

By the way, does the quality stay consistent? I'd hate this to turn into another Wheel of Time (though, to ASoIaF's credit, the plot isn't completely stolen from the Lord of the Rings).

When I was young, I read up on loads of fantasy and sci fi books, including the LOTR, Dune, Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter and the like, but once I started college, I sort of stopped. The Song of Ice and Fire series has really rekindled my interest in the genre, and I'd love for you all to suggest some books to read during these next few months. 

I am currently at the last couple dozen pages of first Hunger Games book, and although I enjoyed it, I didn't find it as good as the GRRM books (perhaps i've been spoiled). So, what do you all suggest? I've heard some good things on The Wheel of Time books - thoughts?

Edit: Thanks to everyone for all the great suggestions! I am really glad that you all came with some great titles - I have made a long list of several of them and will be going to the bookstore tonight to see if I can find any of them. I am an American currently doing some volunteer work in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, so, finding several of the lesser known books may be a challenge, but I'll surely look out for them.

Jon Snow is not Ned's bastard son. He is actually the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. The meaning of Lyanna's last words to Ned (""Promise me"") were for Ned to promise not tell anyone of Jon's true parentage.
I further speculate that Jon is not a bastard at all. Rhaegar and Lyanna were married in their little hideout, making Jon heir to the throne. Ned also knew this, but promised Lyanna to keep it a secret because if word got out that there was a living Targaryen on Westeros Jon certainly would have been killed by either the Baratheons or Lannisters.
The Targaryen dragon has three heads. We know Dany is one of them, I think Jon is the second. No idea as of yet who the third could be.

From what I understand, they were talking about how the Stark-Lannister war was comming too quickly, becase Drogo and Dany will only invade after Drogo's son is born.

That, I assume, means that the guy in Eastos is one of Varys's little birds, and that Varys is interested in preparing the ground for a Targaryen restoration. Until now I though he was just serving ""the realm"" in his own starange way, or himself. But after working out this scene I'm even more confused. Is he just hedging his bets so that he can keep his position if the Targaryen return, or is his goal a Targaryen resotration? And if that is the case, is it for his own benifit or that of the realm (does he want dragons to help fight the walkers?)?

In other words, who do you think Varys really serves, and what makes you think this? And is there anything else in the TV show (or the books - which have already been througherly spoiled for me), that gives clues as to his true intentions?",31,4,False,default,,,,,

What is Petyr's endgame with Sansa?  Do you think he plans to get her on the Iron Throne and then rule through her?

I've recently started reading the books. Got through the first one, and the second. However this is where it got a little confusing. The second book I have is called ""A game of thrones 2: a clash of kings"" black cover, features a hand grasping what I assume is the stag crown. Anyways. The book features a page that shows the next books in the series. However upon reaching what it dubs ""volume 3"" there are 2 books listed
""A storm of swords 1: steel and snow""
and
""A storm of swords 2: blood and gold""
Now at the bookstore where I purchased the second book I saw both of these there sporting different covers (A helmet on the first, and a shield on the second) however when I went to a different bookstore today to attempt to purchase these, I found only 1 storm of swords book. Dubbed simply ""A storm of swords"" paperback, 1100 or so pages, green with the helmet cover.

Tl;DR:
My question is this. Does the book I just purchased (green with the helmet, 1100 pages) contain both volumes (steel and snow, blood and gold) or not?

This obviously hangs on the fact that Jon Snow is not the child of Ned, but of his sister, Lyanna. Consider her history...

Lyanna was present at the Tourney at Harrenhal. There she met Howland Reed and chased away his attackers. The tournament was won by Rhaegar Targaryen, who surprised all present by crowing Lyanna as Queen of Love and Beauty.
Shortly after the tournament Lyanna was apparently kidnapped by Rhaegar. Brandon Stark, upon hearing this, rode straight to King's Landing, and upon entering the keep he roared for Rhaegar ""to come out and die."" King Aerys had Brandon and his companions arrested. Shortly after his father, Rickard Stark, was summoned to the city to answer for the crimes of his son. He was immediately arrested himself and shortly after brutally killed with his son. This was a primary impetus for Robert's Rebellion.
In the war, Lyanna's fiance Robert and her brother Eddard were important leaders, together with Jon Arryn who had been their foster father. The rebels defeated the royal army at the Trident where Rhaegar was killed. This decided the war. House Lannister joined the rebels and took King's Landing killing King Aerys. After this Ned rode to the Tower of Joy in the mountains of Dorne with six companions, and found the three final loyalist members of the Kingsguard - Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Oswell Whent, and Ser Gerold Hightower - guarding it. They fought, and only Ned and Howland Reed survived. Ned found Lyanna inside the tower, dying.
Prior to her death she extracted a promise, its contents as yet not revealed, from Ned. Her final words a phrase that haunts her brother for the rest of his life, they were...
	 ""Promise me, Ned""

We're starting with a series on the books, one book each week, so tomorrow will be for AGOT.  *Any* information in the posted book is open for discussion in that thread; information from future books will need spoiler tags.

After the books, the topics will get more specific and can focus on specific characters, events, theories, or any other detail from the story/show/books.  We'd like the /r/gameofthrones commmmunity to decide what you all want to talk about, so please reply with your suggestions below and upvote those you like.  Popular suggestions posted here will be placed in a poll to determine the order in which they are discussed.  

Example Topic Ideas:
---

* Tyrion Lannister
* Types of magic in the world
* Filming locations for the show
* How will the Essos characters finally make it to Westeros
* Weddings
* Arya Stark
* What will happen in TWOW
* Azor Ahai
* Strong female characters
* Changes from the books to the show
* Jon Snow
* Funny parodies of the show or books
* Gods and their influences
* The Iron Throne and who will be King

It's ok to suggest a topic that is a spoiler to even name it, just use a tag.  If it makes the list the mods will come up with some non-spoiler way to describe the information for pre-warning in its discussion post.  

**Edit:** Sorry!! Here's the missing puppy photo: [my dog Moxie at 9-weeks-old](http://i.imgur.com/oEEo5.jpg)

Edit 2: Working on the schedule table that'll include the topics here once they're decided.

Being an avid fanvideo editor on YouTube, I plan on doing a music video each year for each new season (as well as a few character-specific videos here and there). Here's the first two I've done:

SHOW SPOILERS, btw:

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0B45393845B7DD23&amp;feature=mh_lolz

For anyone interested, these are my plans for future videos:

Season 3 - ""Blood Loss"" by The Horrible Crowes (the more I think about it, I can't imagine any other music playing over the RW)

Season 4 - ""All Along the Watchtower"" by Jimi Hendrix

Tyrion - ""We Did It When We Were Young"" by The Gaslight Anthem (I'll be doing this after season 4, and it will include Tyrion's story from AGOT through ASOS)

The Hound - ""Sing Me No Hymns"" by Lucero (same as previous: AGOT - ASOS)

And I'll probably get more ideas as this goes along.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

I get that Robert is dead, and Stannis is technically Joffrey's enemy, but shouldn't everything Joffrey wears/owns still be Baratheon specific?

In place, they are basically married to their responsibilities and duties. If you had the choice, which would you choose to swear vows to *for life* and why?


Basic descriptions from aSoIaF Wiki:


**The Kingsguard** (Someway somehow, you've been offered a spot)

The Kingsguard, also known poetically as the 'White Swords' or 'White Cloaks', are the royal bodyguards of the Iron Throne. Supposedly the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms, they are sworn to protect their king and his family with their own lives, to obey his commands, and to keep his secrets. They are sworn for life and are forbidden from owning land, taking a wife, or fathering children.


**Maesters of the Citadel**

The maesters are an order of scholars, healers, postmen, and scientists who are trained at a school called the Citadel. They serve as advisers to the Westerosi nobility. They are sometimes called ""the knights of the mind.""


**The Night's Watch**

The Night's Watch is a military order dedicated to holding the Wall, the immense fortification on the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms, defending the realms of men from what lies beyond. The order's foundation dates back to the Age of Heroes, at the time when the Others were pushed back. The men of Night's Watch wear only black.


Bonus: **Silent Sisters** (Actually, if you can just think of a few reasons why anyone would choose this, that would be nice too.)

An order of women sworn to the service of the Stranger, who have taken the vows of chastity and silence. They handle the bodies of the dead, preparing them for funerals. They are not regarded as septas. Silent Sisters are sometimes referred to as 'Wives of the Stranger.' They clothe themselves in grey and keep their faces cowled except for their eyes. 


Remember, this is *for life*!

I am currently 62% through the book and began to wonder who my favorite ""new"" character is. I'll pass the question along to you all: who is your favorite ""new"" character in AFFC?

(I use ""new"" for lack of a better word. Obviously these characters both existed to and in most cases have been mentioned prior to AFFC.)

My favorite has to be [Victarion Greyjoy](http://mattolsonart.deviantart.com/art/Victarion-Greyjoy-244094545?offset=40). Generally speaking, he is a complete bad-ass. Chapter 29, The Reaver, has to be among the best battle scenes I have read in the entire series. Furthermore, his depth of character is a testament to GRRM's amazing ability to allow the reader to feel the emotion and personality of his characters. Personally, Victorian has increased my interest in the Iron Islands story tenfold. [AFFC](/b ""For instance: His interactions with his Euron (both internal and external), skills of war, and maintenance of honor. In many ways he reminds me of Ned Stark in that he sacrifices his own pleasures for honor and religion. For instance: not killing Euron after the whole episode with his former wife"")

She supposedly has been raised as a noble, with a basic education in history and understanding of power balance and influence. And she just hands a religious fanatic permission to raise the most powerful army in the realm along with the right to pass judgement on queens and kings and doesn't even see the epic fail in that...

Then I would stay up ti'll 3am.

In books there are usually one or two twists at the end that blow your mind, this book seemed like every chapter left me with my jaw open. Every single death in the story, all the small details you learn about characters, Zombie Catelyns, and Littlefinger, wtf is up with him, WHAT IS HE PLAYING AT! That last chapter was absolutely inane He truly seems like the definition of chaotic neutral, (or is he?). It's kiling me!"")

Ok, so I must apologize, my post offers nothing to this subreddit, it's just me crapping my pants, sorry, I just had to get it out, because I haven't been able to talk to anyone. I am also torn because I want to finish this book series ASAP so I can come on here and discuss and read theories and things I didn't catch, but at the same time, once I'm done with ADWD I'll have to wait god knows how long till my next fix...

Regardless at this pace, I'll see you all in 3-4 months! Until then I'm staying clear of this subreddit. Thank you for letting me post this shit post.

I just don't really get the appeal for Arya as a character.  I personally think she's way overrated (I'm reading AFFC now, by the way.) I think Maisie Williams does a great job playing Arya and I don't dislike her character, but I just don't get all the love she has.


I find her character to be a little whiny, obsessed with revenge, and not very interesting.  More than anything, she's such a simple character; there isn't much depth to her actions, her thoughts, or her plans.  Humans love complex, multi-dimensional characters; she's as single-minded and violent as many of the other characters.",66,2,False,self,,,,,

I looked at wikipedia and the next book is suppose to have interaction b/w theon and stannis. I meanthe chapters could be describing stannis's death and such..but I'm not too sure if he would die.Most of the characters we die end up coming back anyways.

-Rickon. We don't know anything except he went with osha and davos is suppose to go find him?


-So the red bitch keeps on saying there is only R'hllor and the other god who must not be named(VOLDEMORT!!!j/k). This is false right? Greenseer(being able to skin change, premonitions, and etc) and the god of many faces(face change)...they seem to have powers rivaling of priests of R'hllor. Also, we haven't seen any followers of the drowned god or the seven have any special powers? 

-Can we be certain that the new big kingsguard is somehow zombie gregor? 

-the horn that binds dragons. Do you have total control of the dragon if you blow the horn? 

-Did Martin ever specify when the next book is coming out? Starting from end of season 2 I read all the books...I...need my daily dose of GoT...the withdrawal is killing me.

Dany having been missing for a few months, Victarion will hear rumors that she is dead, but there are still 2 dragons chained up in Mereen, and he still has the power to control them. The Iron Fleet attacks Meereen, and although they are initally winning the battle, Dany shows up with an army of Dothraki and saves the day.

Daenerys now has a horn with the power to control her disobedient dragons, and a fleet of ships to carry her armies to Westeros.

Mainly I think that popular theory is just another red herring in a series that is brimming with them and this one sets up a more interesting conflict for the later books.

It came out of the whole thing with genetics and hair. We know Jon has straight black hair while I understand the Starks themselves have brown/darker shade hair but nothing as far as Jon's. Rhaegar being Targaryen would have had platinum or white hair. So why then if R+L=J would Jon not have either lighter brown or white hair?

This got me thinking. What if Robert in fact had a fling with Lyanna, potentially got drunk one night and raped her. This drove Lyanna away into Rhaegar's safe arms and is a large part of why Robert is so misty-eyed over her. He loved her but drove her away with his brass actions. I always got the feeling that Rhaegar was much more like a classic Arthurian knight. Very handsome, noble, and more importantly chaste. His love with Lyanna was one of courtly love, not the classic sort that we're led to believe. Rhaegar could have been willing to take the child on as his own, so it lines up with the R+L=J theory in why the kingsguard were present at the Tower of Joy. 

Thus Jon is in fact the product of Robert and Lyanna. This is interesting in multiple ways. First it means that Jon would have claim to the Iron Throne through the Baratheon line while Daenerys would have a claim to it through the classical Targaryen line, setting them against each other as opposed to being buddy-buddy or potential marriage material with the current theory.

It also adds a big tragic element to the series. Ned Stark, the paragon of honor in our series, unwittingly bore the product of his BEST FRIEND raping his sister. This could be the secret Lyanna is referring to, thinking Ned knew or that Robert shouldn't know of Jon in fear of what he may do/her wanting to sever all ties with him. I feel like this would tonally fit in with the series more than the straight laced R+L=J. 

It's sketchy and I don't have a lot more evidence to run on but I feel this would be a small but interesting tangent for the series to go on.

As I watch the Season 2 marathon on HBO today, there's something about Arya as Tywin's cup bearer that's always bothered me. (Though good LORD, did I love their scenes together, and it made the whole Harrenhal portion a bit more exciting.)

Tywin would have been familiar with the Stark family - as the Hand for 20 years, I'm sure he had met Rickard, Brandon and Eddard at the very least.  And Arya is supposed to be very much a Stark in appearance, and similar to Lyanna in temperament and appearance.

While I'm not sure Tywin ever met Lyanna, you would think someone as sharp, knowledgeable and powerful as Tywin would recognize a Stark.  Especially after he told Arya he realized she was high-born girl who was masquerading as a commoner.  Also knowing she was a Northerner, you're telling me that it would never have occurred to him that this well-educated, well-raised cup bearer isn't the missing Stark daughter?",21,8,False,self,,,,,

To start off in the books alot of the main characters/children are said to be much younger than i previously thought. In AGOT it says around the beginning of the book that Robb is 14, Bran is 7, Arya is 11, Sansa is 13, and Jon is 13.
Now out of all those children only Arya and Sansa held to what i thought from the show. Robb and Jon honestly looked to be at least 18 or nearing that in the show, hell- Robb even had a nice amount of stubble.
Another noticable age differance i thought was that of Dany, once again in the book is said to be 13, but in the show looks at LEAST 16.

So i just wanted to know if anyone else also noticed this, or if my perception of age is just awful?
And if you did notice, which version (story or show) you feel enhanced the story for you more?

I personally felt that perceiving the characters older made them seem a bit more able in the show, rather than seeming as young children in the books.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I thought for the first few episodes that Theon was a Stark and other little things like that but the biggest one has to do with season 1 eps 9 and 10. 

I watched the entire season 1 in 3 days last summer after seeing people on reddit talking about it after the season ended. When it came to ep 10 I remember seeing Robb slashing at the tree and talking about killing all the Lannisters, then Arya was being kept safe by Yoren (who I vaguely recognised at the time and wasn't really sure who he was). Fast forward to me finally realising for sure that Ned was dead when Sansa is shown his head by Joffrey. I know what ye are all thinking 'shouldn't I have known all this crap from ep9' but there's the thing, I accidentally skipped ep9 and thought this was the way all this was being revealed to us. So bit by bit you learn of what has happened in the last few days and honestly I didn't think much was amiss. Although I think I missed out on the whole Frey bit so I was lost there, and some of Shae too iirc. Now this might not seem too bad, just go back and watch ep 9 right? Problem is I didn't fucking realise what I missed until halfway through season 2. I know the show is pretty hard to follow as it is but some plot points I was literally clueless on but just expected they didn't want us to know and would tell us soon. I realised what I'd missed when I saw a video on youtube called 'Eddard Stark's death'. I felt like such an idiot.

Worst part was for half of season 2 I still thought Ned would be alive in the dungeons and the head they showed Sansa was just some other guy with long hair who they beheaded and tarred. ",21,4,False,self,,,,,

Great site, so great I started listening to the audiobooks instead while playing videogames and then reviewing the chapter summaries later to make sure I didn't miss anything.  That was 4 books ago, and I'm now a few chapters into ADWD and realized they've only written a handful of the chapter summaries.  So uh, be prepared to pay full attention again.

But then, you read the very next chapter, and THAT chapter ends with a thrill, and you just have to keep reading to find closure. This happens with every single chapter in all the books (although I am only halfway through A Storm of Swords) and it literally makes it impossible to put down.

Robb betrayed the Freys, but no worry, Edmure Tully shall wed one of Walder's daughters. Ah what a nice wedding, wait? Robb is dead?! Caitlyn as well?! This can't be happening, the Starks were meant to be the heroes!

I began trying to pinpoint exactly what it was about this series that I love so much, and I think it's this:

The moral ambiguity of the entire plot/every character.  That's what sets it apart from other fantasy, in my opinion.  LOTR is great, but all the main characters are heroes, plain and simple.  They're all driven by the same desire: to save Middle Earth and defeat evil.  In ASOIAF, the morals are all over the map.  There are some characters who live by a code of honor, some who care about family above all else.  Some live for glory, others seem to have no moral code whatsoever.  It's even unclear if the ""god of light"" and his followers are good or not.  So far the only ""pure evil"" things we've seen are the Others, and (spoiler) there's an exception to that rule too.

Leagues better than the first two. GRRM, how the fuck do you come up with this stuff ? 

This just set huge expectations for Season 3 and I have no doubt they will be able to fulfill it. I hope they don't leave out any parts even the minor details.

So many incredible moments, where do I start ? 

* so much death: Robb, Cat, Joffery, Balon Greyjoy, Lysa, Tywin, Red Viper, etc. etc.
* Frey's betrayal. Unbelievable moment. Can't wait to hear the Rains of Castemere when Season 3 airs. 
* Arya's sad journey. First with the outlaws and Dondarrion, then with the person I last expected, the Hound. I was hoping she would finally be re-united with her mother, but what a conclusion to her story. I loved the part where she got revenge on Polliver and the Tickler. **Is there gold in the village?** Valar Moghulis!
* Jamie's PoV really gave a new perspective on him. Don't hate him as much as before, but he's still a dirtbag for fucking his sister **especially while she was on her period, ewwww**. His monologues on why he killed Aerys were particularly interesting and his dreams.
* Daenerys' chapters were some of the best. UNSULLIED ARMY conquering multiple slaver cities!!! 
* Ever since his removal from the Kingsguard, I was wondering where Ser Barristan was. Then finally he showed up. I was not prepared. 
* Everything to do with the Night's Watch was epic. the White Walkers attack on the Fist of the First Men, the betrayal and killing of the Old Bear, the Wildlings: Mance Rayder, the Magnar, Ygritte, etc., Snow's undercover mission and his return to Castle Black, the attack on the Wall, Stannis' army comes in the nick of time to save the day, the piece of shit Janos Slynt's attempt to become Lord Commander, Stannis offers to make Jon into a true Stark and Lord of Winterfell
* I've always disliked Bran and hated reading his chapters, but even his chapters were interesting. His two travel companions and their interesting tales especially the one about the crannogman who defeated three shittalking squires at a tourney, and let's not forget HODOR! HODOR! HOOOODDDDDOOOOOORRR!
* STANNIS!!! What more can be said. Our good Ser Onion Knight, Hand of the King. One of the best characters in the series.
* Tyrion and Sansa. DAAAAMMMMNNNN! Never cared much for Sansa and still don't. Tyrion was something else. He almost died!!! He got backstabbed so hard. PS. Fuck you Tywin, you deserved worse.
* Varys still being Varys
* Littlefinger is a fucking trip. Lysa is the one who poisoned Jon Arryn all along. I thought it was that bitch Cersei. 
* So many new outstanding characters: the Tyrells, the Dornishmen, Brave Companions aka Bloody Mummers, the Blackfish, etc.
* Brienne the wench almost got raped and Jamie saves her life just like she saved his multiple times. Her duel with Jamie, her confrontation with the Knight of Flowers

Sure, in the book, this also doubles as a bit of exposition, but I much prefer the succinctness of the show.

The second is the saying about king and the hand. In the book, it's the King eats, and the Hand takes the shit. In the show, it's the King shits, and the Hand wipes. The visceral of the show's version just makes me like it more.

SPOILERS SOS",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/wqosf/i_absolutely_adore_asoiafgot_but_heres_a_concern/,[deleted],1342582931,"Now before you downvote me simply for saying something sort of negative about GOT, hear me out. So we all know by now that SOS will be divided between seasons 3&amp;4, and I think many people agree that the division will be the Red Wedding, (especially because oberyn martell isn't getting casted for season 3.) But this makes me concerned that season 3 may not be AS exciting as it's getting hyped for. But as I read SOS, I felt that the whole first half was interesting, but not all that much was happening plot-wise, but mainly setting the stage for the incredible storm of awesomeness that is the entire second half.

I'm concerned the show will follow a similar pattern, making season 3 kind of action-less and potentially, I hate myself for saying this, boring. I know there are fans (including myself) who get so excited about anything that happens on the show, so this may not be a major problem at all, but does anyone else feel this way?

Jon Snow: Son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen &amp; Lyanna Stark
 
Lyanna made Ned make an unknown dying promise to her (to look after her son maybe?)
 
At the end of Robert's Rebellion, about one year later, Eddard and his companions find three of the Kingsguard at the Tower of Joy. The reasons for their presence and the ensuing fight are unknown, but defending the unborn son of the Heir Apparent would be a good reason to have been posted.
 
Neds honour would say that bedding another while married to Cat would be highly unlikely
 
Robb, Sansa, Bran and Rickon are said to have Tully features (hair color, eyes), Jon and Arya are said to be closer in appearance (which had made Sansa believe Arya was also a bastard like Jon, until her mother put Sansa's theory down). Arya is said to resemble Lyanna.
 
 
 
 
Jon will be become Azor Ahai reborn?
 
When Melisandre  looks into her fires for Azor Ahai, she sees only things to do with Jon or snow, which he thinks must just be ash but she sees a possible connection to Jon
 
Blood of the dragon a prerequisite (see son of Rhaegar)
Jon chose his duty to the Night's Watch over his love for Ygritte. He indirectly caused her death by warning Castle Black of the incoming wildling raid. Similar to Azor Ahai sacrificing Nissa Nissa to complete Lightbringer.
Also, when Mellisandre claims Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn, I cant remember exactly who says it but it is said that the sword gives off no heat

I personally think it's a cool narrative move in the cases of [AFFC](/b ""Sansa/Alayne and Arya/Cat"") because it helps cement how important and high-stakes it is that they not be discovered as their true identities. However, in the case of [AFFC](/b ""Arya, I wonder: why now? With the exception of AGOT, she's spent pretty much the entire series in hiding, so why weren't her previous chapters titled ""Weasel"" or ""Arry"" or ""Salty""? "") 
There's also the question of why some characters' chapters bear their own names while others don't. 
I've heard the theory that it's purely to keep sneaky readers from flipping ahead to see if a character dies or not, but given what I know of GRRM and his style, I have to assume these choices are artistic and serve some purpose.

The idea portrays the entirety of Westeros including the free cities etc... where by each character is represented by their house vigil or defining feature, upon moving a timeline marker, the characters avatars will move according to where they are at that particular time in the story, this way it would be visually easier to identify where all the characters are in relation to each other at any point in the series. 

You could also move the cursor over a vigil to identify what the character is doing at that time, (their current objectives and loyalties) with the major events of the saga being highlighted on the timeline...

I love the books - a lot. I'm part way through AFFC. Incredibly well-written characters all around. And for me (a 27 yo woman) GRRM writes the different women incredibly well.
The show has failed me. I can't stand the women in the show. All their sources of strength and any power they can wield in their hyper-patriarchal universe is taken away.

Possible minor Spoiler:

ie:
Arya beating Hot Pie so badly he can't walk. In the show, she's basically 'saved' by Gendry.

I don't wan't to list a bunch of spoilers, but there are tons of little pieces like this where characters like Catelyn, Dany, and Arya are just lame in the show and far more enjoyable in the books.

For the record: I think most of the men in the show are done very well, casting, direction, dialogue etc. is all very enjoyable.

Anyone else get this feeling? Am I totally off-base?",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I don't really know how to feel about this however. On one hand I guess it's interesting with another major player and claimant to the throne, but on the other hand I can't help but to feel that it's a bit of a Deus ex machina plot device as there has been no hint of him earlier in the books. 

I thought for a while that maybe the discussion between Illyrio and Varys that Arya overheard in the first book had contained some hints regarding him, but when I went back to check it didn't, just mentions of Dany.

If I remember correctly as well they explain the events that transpired during the sacking of King's landing and claim that [ADWD](/b ""Varys had hid Aegon and switched him with a commoner's child. However when they showed the corpse to Tywin and Robert how could they possibly get him to pass as a Targaryen since they're supposed to have a very distinct appearance with their silver hair and purple eyes?"") It feels rather confabulated, as it GRRM never intended to include him in the story from the beginning and threw him in on a whim while writing ADWD.

What are your views on 'Young Griff' and his appearance in ADWD? As I mentioned I'm not finished with the book yet, and I'm sure there are others like me who are currently reading who would like to participate in the discussion while avoiding spoilers, so please use tags!",26,6,False,self,,,,,

What are Varys's true motives? This is going to get into spoilers right about here.

[all books](/b ""So we know that varys is supporting the Targarians via the Dorne plot but my question is why. He doesn't seem to have any motivation to do anything that he does. He doesn't seem to have any axe to grind against any of the other houses, he's nice enough to Ned and Tyrion despite his allegance to the dragons. He doesn't have anything to avenge as far as we are aware. He doesn't have a family to think about or protect. He doesn't seem very interested in land titles or money and even if he was surely that would push him toward the Lannisters. The only thing I can think of that would cause this loyalty is being faithful to one of the Targarians but if that's the case it is not explored, as far as I am aware he only served under Aeris and that cant have encouraged him to be loyal surely. The closest we ever come to hearing his motives are that he serves the realm. In that case surely supporting an invasion and subsequent war is a bad idea. If he want's to just bring peace then why not just side with the Lannisters or Starks or even the Baratheons. Varys surely had enough information to prevent Roberts death or if not he has enough influence to have ensured that either Renly of Stannis got a clear shot. Banking on the Targarians is surely a more dangerous bet."")

That said, is there anyone here that is worried this particular scene might hurt the show?  Allow me to explain."")

[ASOS](/b ""I think we would all agree that the difference between the television medium and the book medium cannot be understated; it's one of the most common justifications that people use when defending changes from the books by the show's producers and writers.  Likewise, there are many who tune into the show who aren't going to be nearly as invested in the story as a whole as all of us on this subreddit are.  In fact, it is often those that aren't ""fanboys"" that ensure a show's livelihood and continuance.  Television producers know the hardcore fans will be there week in and week out, and it's the more casual fans tuning in that turn a decent rating into a good rating or a good rating into a great rating."")

[ASOS](/b ""Essentially, I'm worried that the Red Wedding is going to be too much for the casual fan.  I can't count the sheer number of people I know that are emotionally invested in Robb and Cat.  At social events I'll hear people randomly yell out ""THE KING IN THE NORTH,"" to cite an example.  Basically, I'm not sure the casual show watcher [note I'm not saying all show watchers; just casual] doesn't understand the world GRRM has built; they don't realize that this isn't the traditional 'good guys win/bad guys lose' series.  I'm afraid they are going to throw up their hands and say ""to hell with this show"" when the Red Wedding goes down because the most obvious protagonists get killed off."")

[AGOT](/b ""Many will point to Ned getting killed to quash this theory, but I think a strong case can be made for Ned getting killed because it really set in motion a multitude of events."")

[ASOS](/b ""If the Red Wedding angers a multitude of fans, I can envision the show being hurt, either from a ratings fall which leads to ending the show early, or ""unnecessary changes"" from the book story lines to not anger those fans again - essentially to protect ratings"")

Note: I'm not overly worried about these concerns because I think HBO has done a fantastic job with the series, and I think that most people are probably going to love the twists and turns.  I also realize HBO is more protected from the sudden change in ratings than the networks are because of their business model.  Still, I thought I'd pose the question for the community for discussion.  If anything, at least it's a different angle from which to consider this scene.  

So, what do you think /r/gameofthrones?

For me I was kind of annoyed with a bit of dialogue they changed from ACOK.  It's when Stannis is having his letter to the seven kingdoms proof read, and he takes issue with the fact they titled jaime as ""Jaime The Kingslayer"" instead of ""*Ser* Jaime the Kingslayer"".  In the TV series he only takes issue with the fact they left out the 'Kingslayer' part of it.

With this update there are now 150 options for username flair.  65 of those options have Alternate Words.  Bits of the update have been partially rolled out over the last few days, so those with sharp eyes may have already noticed some.  Here's a rundown of the changes:

25 new flair options 
---

Group Name|Alternate Words|   
:---|:---
House Baratheon of King's Landing|The King Can Do As He Likes
House Bettley|
House Blackwood|
House Blanetree|
House Bracken|
House Caron|No Song So Sweet
House Crane|
House Darklyn|
House Dayne of High Hermitage|Fallen And Reborn
House Ferren|
House Flint of Widow's Watch|Ever Vigilant
House Fossoway of Cider Hall|Taste Of Glory
House Fowler|Let Me Soar
House Marbrand|Burning Bright

7 Alternate Words Additions/Changes
---

Group Name|Alternate Words|   
:---|:---
House Bolton|Our Blades Are Sharp
House Clegane|A Hound Will Never Lie To You
House Connington	|We Are The Storm
House Dayne|Fallen And Reborn
House Frey|We Take Our Tolls
House Reyne|A Lion Still Has Claws
Red Priests|The Night Is Dark And Full Of Terrors

Existing Sigil Updates
---

A few of the existing sigils have been updated for polish or to bring them in line with the Season 2 set in the header now.  For example the Stark emblem is using the more traditional grey on white without the green sometimes used in the show.

3D Effects
---

All of the flair options have been updated to use 3D effects.  The shields are now rounded and cast shadows.  This provides better matching to the new 3D UI for /r/gameofthrones, and in general it looks more cool.  You don't have to resubmit your flair choice to see this change; it's automatic for everyone.


Other Notes
---

If you currently have an option without Words that now has a Words option, you'll need to resubmit your flair choice on the [Choose Your House](http://reddit.kevinhatch.com/) page to apply the new Words.   Anyone with old Words that have been changed can keep that text, but once changed the old Words are lost.  If you have any questions about the update, please post them below.

2199,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-7-21,2012,7,21,2,wvt9b,self.gameofthrones,[Meta] Regarding the State of the Subreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/wvt9b/meta_regarding_the_state_of_the_subreddit/,Alame,1342805941,"Just going to add a quick disclaimer up top to say that I'm NOT trying to tell you guys what type of content you should be submitting. YOU are the subreddit, that's up to you.  I just want to know what the decision is so that I and others of the same mindset can make our decision about whether or not we want to stay subbed to the subreddit, and how we should vote in the matter of ASOIAFs spoiler policy.

The mod post about all the Batman posts got me thinking about the state of this subreddit.  I've been humming and hawing over unsubbing for a while now, but I haven't as of yet.

I am a reader.  I am one who enjoys observing your development through the story, prodding your interest a little further, and encouraging you to take it that bit further and pick up the books.  I provide context where the show leaves it out, and just generally do my best to enrich your experience with this series.  Remember that Bran &amp; Rickon calamity, where the lot of us faithfully lied to you to preserve your experience?  I personally spent several hours in that thread finding the lower-down posts where the outcome had been spoiled for someone, and taking the time to convince them that the spoiler was in fact false.  Why?  Because I want you to enjoy the series as much as I did, and that means preserving the shock-value of the shocking moments.

Anyway, back on topic.  This subreddit quite frankly has degenerated in quality in rapid fashion since it's creation.  I quote to you the sidebar description of what this subreddit is for:
&gt;This subreddit is meant to be a safe place to read and talk about the TV series and books regardless of how many episodes or books you have seen or read.

This becomes even more important with the recent discussions in /r/asoiaf to go full-spoiler zone up to aDwD.  For those of you that don't know, that means being in /r/asoiaf means we will automatically assume you are comfortable with spoilers up until the end of aDwD, and these spoilers will NOT be tagged.  While this decision is still churning amongst the community, 95% of /r/asoiaf is already spoilers through aDwD, making it a very frustrating subreddit for anyone who is not that far in the series.  /r/gameofthrones is supposed to be a slower-paced subreddit for discussion of the same series, in a spoiler-safe environment.  Unfortunately this doesn't happen.  The front page at the time of writing this post consists of:

- 12% discussion threads 
- 4% Mod announcements 
- 4% text-jokes, 
- 4% Emmy nomination news 
- 4% infographic
- 72% memes/karma whoring/pictures of GoT themed everyday stuff/joke posts.

Four of the posts on the front page ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/wvgft/look_what_i_got_from_my_arbitrary_day_match/) [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/wvhaf/pleasantly_surprised_to_see_this_something_i_had/) [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/wv3qh/i_asked_my_gf_for_a_got_themed_cake_well_she_did/) [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/wvd8p/a_friend_of_a_friend_made_this_tote_bag_for_me/)) are outright violations of the posting policy:
&gt;Photos of generic merchandise purchases are no longer considered relevant. Do not post photos of your books, t-shirts, pins, swords, or any other run-of-the-mill swag that anyone can get.


Quite frankly, to me /r/gameofthrones feels like an amalgamation of /r/pics, /r/adviceanimals, /r/lookwhoimet, and /r/circlejerk all smashed into one Game-of-Thrones-flavoured package.  Well, there's a reason that I don't subscribe to any of the aforementioned subreddits.

I've seen countless comments in /r/asoiaf about how repulsive this subreddit is to some people.  I've seen people come to /r/asoiaf to try and participate in discussion (as they cannot do so on this subreddit) and leave disappointed because most of the discussion is beyond their scope.  If you look for image posts on /r/asoiaf, (there aren't many, most are removed) almost every one comes complete with a condescending comment about /r/gameofthrones,  usually in the vein that this subreddit is for the circlejerking, karma whoring, etc while asoiaf is strictly for discussion.

I am extremely impressed that the mods have attempted to solve this issue with the 'talk only' theme mode, but that doesn't solve the issue.  There simply isn't enough discussion-based content in this subreddit for that to work.

Whats the deal here guys.  Are you a discussion subreddit, or are you a theme subreddit?  If the latter, I will happily unsubscribe and fight against asoiaf becoming a full-spoiler zone, but I think this subreddit deserves better than that.  Especially with all the effort the mods have put in.

How do you introduce Jojen and Meera Reed?  You obviously can't have them coming to Winterfell to pledge their support, so how do Bran and company meet them and get to know them?

2.  Do you separate Bran and Rickon?  It was Luwin's idea to separate them, but with him out of the picture do they split up and if they do, for what reasons?

3.  How do you handle the Sam situation?  In the end of season 2 a white walker sees him with an army of wights behind him.  He probably won't be able to kill the white walker with the entire army behind him, so how you do you have Sam get out of his situation without being killed and have him kill a white walker?

4.  How do you tell the audience what happened to Winterfell?  The show was really vague with what happened, and with Bran never noting that there were dead islanders in Winterfell, the audience is led to believe that the iron islanders sacked it and took Theon captive.  There isn't any Theon in SoS, but would you write him in to introduce Ramsay and the Boltons and explain what happened to Winterfell?

5.  Why would Dany ever leave Qarth?  In the show the Thirteen are the only sort of government the city has, and with them all dead, why wouldn't Dany stay there and wait for her dragons to grow?  She's probably going to end up going to the docks to look for a ship and end up being almost assassinated, but what reason would you give for her wanting to leave?

6.  Last but not least, last season had sex scenes that weren't in CoK (Renly/Margaery, Stannis/Melisandre, Robb/Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter).  How would you add nudity to this season that isn't in the book?  (So that means no Jon/Ygritte)


Don't predict what will happen in these scenarios, but what you would do for each one if you were given a job as a writer for season 3.  There's a lot of content that hasn't matched up book to show so far, but these were the changes I thought to be the most significant.  If you can think of another scenario that I forgot feel free to pose that as well.  ",16,11,False,self,,,,,

Waiting half the book to finally reach the chapter was painful but it was worth the wait. 

Honestly there's not much discussion value here, I just want to give a shout out to how happy I am that [](/b ""Arya"") remains the most badass little character in the book. The way she's handling being blind and embracing life at the black and white temple and constantly growing and learning and evolving is a joy to read amongst all these dreary Dany chapters.

From the first book I said Arya's plot line and character development aspired to become amazing, and finally reaching this chapter and seeing that she's OK and growing more badass yet has not left me disappointed.

Actually, writing this is making me nervous, there's still half a book to go before I'm up to date meaning plenty of opportunities for her to get killed since I like her chapters so much..",3,3,False,self,,,,,

On our favorite television series however, I'm pretty sure they are referred to exclusively as White Walkers (although really the only ones we've seen clearly are mounted on wight horseback, but I digress). 

Which do you prefer? I find The Others to be a much more sinister term, although perhaps a little difficult to convey over television. ""The Others take you,"" a common phrase in the book series, probably wouldn't make sense in tv without the capital letters. ""Wait, what? The other... Who? The other who take him? What?"" Etc.

Well, we decided to release a bunch, so if you head over to http://mc.westeroscraft.com/ and click on ""Blog"", it should be the 3rd or so from the top - the one with all the links. You just plop them in your Saves folder and it should be all groovy; each download also contains a schematic if you know what to do with it.

Just a heads up: King's Landing might be a little broken - apparently, we didn't dip low enough on the schematic so some of the secret passages under the Red Keep are cut off. Please let me know if this hasn't been updated yet.

Enjoy!

You'll definitely need this and make sure you use [MCPatcher](http://mcpatcher.net/?p=download&amp;lang=en) or [Optifine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-125-optifine-hd-c6-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/) to get everything displaying correctly.

Feel free to give your viewpoint as well.

1) The Reeds were never introduced in season 2. Bran and Rikkon part ways at the end of ACOK but stay together in the tv series. The Reeds need to be introduced fairly soon for Brans story line to continue. 
2) Dontos has been introduced, but his story with Sansa was taken out completely. I'm thinking the show writers might do the godswood scene where he gives sansa the hairnet within the first episodes.
3) The writers changed Dany's story in ACOK drasticly. Without her predictions she heard in the house of the undying, how will this affect season 3
4) Not a concern, but wouldn't it be awesome of HBO delayed season 3 a month. There's a scene in ASOS that totally should air on father's day. If you've read it you know what i'm talking about",26,8,False,self,,,,,

A few weeks ago I finished reading ACOK and today I finished watching Season 2. (It's an old habit of mine to wait until I've finished reading the book to watch the movie/show adaptation) I am slightly confused about the relationship between Tyrion and Shae. In the book, it seemed to me that the relationship was as it was when Tyrion established in his tent when they first met. In Tyrion's chapters of the book he sometimes makes comments about how she still a whore and has no true feelings for him, and that she only loves his gold and her dresses and jewelry, however, in the show their relationship is depicted is being far more intimate and loving than what I gathered from the books thus far. (I only started ASOS today, so I am unsure how their relationship progresses at this point).

It stains your teeth.  I think it may be chewing tobacco, but I can't be sure, since I don't know if it's ever described being spat.  However, I do know it's addictive since people who chew it usually have a habit.  

Other substances are very clearly analogs to ones on earth.  Milk of the poppy is obviously some kind of opium substrate used by healers to  ease pain.  Surprisingly, no one seems to abuse it, but I guess that's because it also puts you fast asleep.  

Others, such as the Tears of Lys are a bit more cloudy.  I don't know much about arsenic or other poisons, but I do know the tears basically cause your digestive tract to fail and give your death the appearance of an illness.  

Are there any facts/theories about these plants and substances?  It seems like GRRM uses earth analogs whenever possible to make the writing seem more realistic, but has anybody ever conclusively proven that a substance in Westeros is the same as one on earth?

Personally, I wasn't exposed to GRRM's universe of ASOIAF until I began watching the HBO show.  I watched both seasons before confronting this interesting choice.  Eventually, I picked up the first book and never looked back - I ended up powering through all 5 in a month, they were that addictive.

Now some of you are probably wondering if reading past book 2 will make the show less exciting to watch.  While it's true that big plot twists would no longer be surprises, I have found that the show can be enjoyed in conjuction with the books.  You would experience the plots in written form, then get to see how it plays out in the visual medium.  Watching GRRM's characters come to life on-screen is a treat for the eyes.

You'll also find that the show complements the book very well in that it maintains an incredible amount of continuity and detail in a mere 10 hour season.  Naturally, the books have a HUGE advantage in the sense that they encompass all of GRRM's imagination - the show's limited run-time can't possibly cover the broad scope of the books.  The books offer so much in terms of additional characters, backstory, perspectives, 'world' history, monologue.  If you thought the show was rich interesting detials, just you wait.

Whatever you do, DO NOT START READING AT BOOK 3.  The literary style will clash strikingly with the spoken dialogue of the show...book readers know what I'm talking about.  In addition, you will have missed SO many extra characters, plot points, prophecies, and explanations that the show just doesn't have time to cover.  In essence, a reader who starts at book 3 will be very confused after a short time.

In the end, if you're a fan of this universe GRRM has created you have to ask yourself:  at the rate the show is being produced, can you intentionally wait years and years to read each book while simultaneously trying to avoid exposure to spoilers in pop culture?  I couldn't, and I have no regrets.",36,42,False,self,,,,,

I understand that his goal is to marry Sansa to someone of good standing and appropriate wealth, and help her reclaim Winterfell as her rightful seat. I think that he plans to use this to his advantage by ""helping"" her and her husband essentially run the North. 

Does he plan on instigating another rebellion in the North against the Iron Throne?

I'm not much of a book reader even though I do know that the books are always better, maybe I'll come round to reading them one day.

Anyway, I would just like to know who your favourite character is and why? (this must've been asked a million times before here, but I'm new, sorry!) 
      My favourite character is the Hound, Sandor Clegane, I find him very intriguing as his actions can be so caring for a man of his size and the hobbies which he enjoys, killing. His past also adds to the interest I have for this character. However his role is not that big (I assume) and thus a 'key player' I find interesting in the series is Lord Baelish, his sneaky schemes attached with his intelligence makes him a character I very much enjoy following throughout the series.

The next highest I've found is Troy, with 3 actors, and written by David Benioff.  Troy's list: Ned Stark, Lord Mormont (who is killed by Ned, lol), and Maester Pycelle.

1) **Do not make things personal.**  It's meant to be good-spirited teasing, not actual insults.

2) If you're going to mention a future event that hasn't been in the show yet, spoiler tags still apply.  You do not have to use spoiler tags for anything that has been shown in the series so far.

3) TRASH TALKING ONLY WORKS IN ALL CAPS!

LET'S GET IT ON!

I'm on page 420 (hehe) Third (maybe 4th?) Reek chapter. Here are some thoughts so far.

[ADWD up to page 420](/b ""Aegon? wtf? Part of me still thinks that he is a fraud, or maybe I just WANT him to be a fraud because I like Dany more. Jon Snow is turning into a badass, and I'm becoming conflicted between whether I want to see Stannis or Dany sit the Iron Throne in the end. Reading from Melisandre's viewpoint complete changed my opinion on her in a few paragraphs. I'm hoping she teaches Jon how to warg out, that would be sweet. Watching Tyrion go though his depression is tough. I'm kind of a Stannis when it comes to that stuff, I want to just slap him and scream ""it doesn't fucking matter where whores go! get your shit together!"" Quentyn, Aegon, Tyrion, Jorah, and Victarion maybe more are all making their way to Dany. It would be pretty cool if Dany grabbed the Dornish and the Ironborn, with Tyrion as an advisor and a forgiven Jorah back in her Kingsguard and finally set off to Westeros, but I've read enough GRRM by now to know that will never happen. More likely Dany's dragons will eat them all in an ironic twist and Ramsay 'cuntnugget' fucking Bolton will end up sitting the Iron Throne. The Asha chapter was pretty cool, I have a feeling she'll resurface again."")

Whew, I feel better now. Don't spoil meh please, so far I've managed to read some majors for every other book except ADWD. I'm off to read more (Reek, reek, rhymes with geek), but I do have one small yes or no question if somebody could answer:

Alright I just finished ADWD and really wonder what happened with that lady. We know a few things, she was not a whore and that she has black hair and was beautiful annnd that is about it.

 Also we know that when Cat was with her father on his deathbed, he kept on saying Tysha. So if we assume it is the same Tysha then that would mean that somehow she could have ended up being a paramore for the late Tully. EDIT: just wikied it, it was Tansy not Tysha... whoops.

Or, if that is a different Tysha (or the name was so close that I thought it was Tysha) Tywin could have easily sent her overseas to Braavos so that his son never saw her again, plus that could help explain why his father was so adamant on not traveling to Braavos when he was younger (assuming his wish to travel was after the Tysha incident). 

She also could have been sent to the slave trade, not as happy, but still a possibility.  

Or she is dead.

So where do you think she ended up? Will we never know (most likely like Jon snow's mother) or will she somehow show up and see Tyrion again?",16,0,False,self,,,,,

I think), and Elia and her kids are murdered by the Mountain.

Now all of these facts are just jumbled around, and I'd love for someone to sort this out in order *(I'm too paranoid to google or turn to a wiki of ice and fire, for fear of spoilers)*, and clarify (up to the end of ASOS, if possible, if more information is revealed later) why the elder Starks went to King's Landing in the first place, how Robert and Ned became wards of Jon Arryn, and why Lyanna died.

Thanks!

###AMOIAF v1.12 [[view]](http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1343329751)[[download]](http://www.mediafire.com/?mpwsz1yab9ds4hg)

**NOTE:** To view the downloaded swf file you drag it into any flash-enabled internet browser.  For best performance you can also view it in a standalone flash projector [[windows]](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/11/flashplayer_11_sa.exe) [[mac]](http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/11/flashplayer_11_sa.app.zip).

changelog:

* *added:* The Gates of the Moon in The Vale
* *fixed:* accidentally left in a troubleshooting box; took it out

v1.11

* *changed:* Info Box close button modified.
* *fixed:* Yunkai and Meereen descriptions no longer contain spoilers.
* *fixed:* typo: ~~Jorah~~ Jeor Mormont

v1.1

* *Hoverable Location Info:* The house, ruler, sigil and words of a place will display when hovering on a location (if applicable).
* *Clickable Location Info:* Many locations bring up additional information when clicked.
* *Cursor-Centered Mousewheel Zoom:* When zooming with mousewheel the map auto-pans so same point is under your cursor.
* *Proportional Mousewheel Zoom:* Zoom doesn't 'slow down' at higher magnifications when using mousewheel.
* *changed:* Woodlands and Marshlands are now vector icons (previously solid-colored overlays).
* *changed:* Legend now displayed in portrait at bottom right (previously landscape at top left).
* *fixed:* Minimap button hitbox no longer glitchy.
* *fixed:* Westerlands/Riverlands border to be more accurate (Raventree Hall now in Riverlands as a result, where it should be).
* *fixed:* The North border to include more islands.
* *fixed:* The following typos: Hills of ~~Horvos~~ Norvos, ~~Kayse~~ Kayce, ~~Sunkenwood~~ Snakewood, ~~Seaguard~~ Seagard, ~~Saltcliff~~ Saltcliffe,  ~~Stone Dance~~ Stonedance, The Sorrows (~~Choryane~~ Chroyane), ~~Sellhorys~~ Selhorys, ~~Bhonash~~ Bhorash.
* *removed:* Red Dunes; it is actually Vaith, which is already displayed.
* *added:* Wendwater river label in Stormlands.
* *added:* Castle Cerwyn in The North.
* *added:* Selectable area prompts for the following: Skagos, Thenn, The Skirling Pass, Bear Island, Old Wyk, Shield Islands, The Arbor, Isle of Faces, Driftmark, Claw Isle, Stepstones, Red Waste, Ibben, Summer Isles (label), Asshai &amp; The Shadow (label)


So I made a lot of changes; the biggest being the info boxes that pop up.  All the info is basically copy/pasted from [AWOIAF](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Main_Page).  I modified some of it and changed the formatting obviously.  I didn't proofread it all so there may be errors or typos here and there.  I'll fix them if you let me know.

All the info is as of the beginning of AGOT, so there aren't any spoilers and none of the info boxes *should* contain any real spoilers (just backstory).  If a location doesn't have pop-up information it's because the wiki had less than one or two lines on it, so I didn't bother to include it.  If there are any other locations you'd like to see on the map let me know and I may include them; however, I won't add anything that is somewhat speculative.

****
###POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATES

**AMOIAF Lite:**  Let me know how this latest version performs on lower-end computers.  It's all vector graphics and text so the file size is &lt;1MB and I think it should work well on most any computer.  But if it's inordinately slow on lower-end computers I may make a ""lite"" version without certain features.

**AMOIAF Uber:** I also may make a jumbo sized version for displaying at higher resolutions (obviously you'd need a fast machine for it to work smoothly).

**A Guide of Ice and Fire:** I realize that a lot of people would love to see a chronological timeline.  You could see characters moving, armies moving, territories changing hands, and text notifications of major events.  Play, pause, and skip to different timepoints/chapters.  I could probably implement all of the functionality.  However, I wonder what you guys think is the best chronological timeline out there.  I haven't done much research into this yet, but is there a universally agreed upon timeline?  What is the best one to go by?  If there isn't a good one maybe you guys could help make one for me so I can make the Guide.",10,52,False,self,,,,,

He's so disturbed but I think that's because his mother was pretty messed up from first being married to a very old man and then raped by an unknown stranger and having her only support (her husband) murdered, leaving her left alone and rejected in the town. He's not completely to blame for his cruel demeanor. 

In addition he probably never had friends because he was a fairly well taken care of bastard and he was taught he was better than everyone else so how could he become down to earth with everyone else. Similarly, Reek was cruel and damaged as a friend and teacher so he had no one to teach him what normal nice behavior was. 

Perhaps as we read along he may have a larger story to reveal why he's so cruel and the insecurities he has that makes him feel he must always assert his dominance over those he's around. I personally suspect that he may be a victim of molestation from his mother and Reek which causes him to have a warped sense of sexuality. There was probably a lot of scary things happening in that house for punishment and a lot of shame for Ramsay when he was unceremoniously introduced into the court while having none of the skills everyone else had such as a formal education, literacy and swordsmanship. There could be a lot more to him than people think.

**TL;DR**: I think he gets a bad wrap, I'm not saying he's not a bad person, but I'm saying he was made to be what he was and who knows, he could have a muffin underneath all the hate. 

If you're interested: I'm a Tom Hiddleston fan, and I don't want to sound like a fangirl but I **really** want him to be Ramsay Bolton only because I think he could pull off being really cruel but having some sort of a quality that makes him easy to follow while humanizing him.

Gotta have these discussions with *somebody*. I think we all can agree that ASOS will make for some of the most intense, climactic television ever, but...

Given that it will be a couple years before the show would reach AFFC or ADWD, it seems worthwhile to discuss how they'll shift from the quite literal storm of swords in the next couple of seasons to the much slower character-developer content. I know that many of you, like myself, enjoy the thorough exploration of the ASOIAF universe, but will that convert to good TV? Even if we, the fanboys, are happy watching our characters continue their journeys, will your average viewer? 

Also, since AFFC and ADWD run along the same timeline there's always the possibility that a season 5 could incorporate plot elements from both simultaneously, but would that hurt the telling of the story? How do you see the production team dealing with the continuous additions of new characters? They've combined some, which seems to be a good way of doing things for the most part, but the sheer numbers get a little wild as we read chapters from a plethora of new characters like The Reaver and The Soiled Knight. I guess we just have to have faith.

(HUGE SPOILERS)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/x9bcq/warning_scopeb_asos_so_im_a_bit_past_halfway/,Riggs909,1343412555,"First post here. So I became a huge fan of the show like 10s of millions of other people and to curtail the terribly long wait until S3 I bought the boxset. These are the first books I've picked up that I simply can not put down and end up reading 100 or more pages in one sitting in lieu of playing videogames, watching through great tv series, or many other things I enjoy very much.

And then (another warning to avert your eyes here if you mistakenly clicked this thread somehow or if I botched the warning tag in the title), I got to the part where Robb and Catelyn and the North's only collective chance venture off to break bread with that crotchety old bastard of a pedo, the Late Lord Frey. And then George R. R. Martin proceeds to go ""Oh you thought you were attached to lesser characters in Winterfell or Ned Stark huh? I'll teach you to grow attached to ANY of my characters you little shit!""-hunts down the part of my being that has grown to love these characters over 2 and a half books, and has his angry sweaty spiteful way with it. No work of fiction has made me want to go full on Kathy Bates in Misery (look it up if need be), find Martin, and cinderblock my way to an alternative 'happier' scenario. Hes that good....eeerrr or bad.You know what I mean.

So whats the point of my post? Well, perhaps its silly, but can someone in the most spoiler free way possible just give me some bit of assurance that things do get better for the protagonists in the book instead of just a circlejerk for all of the antagonists? I know its absurd to want to do not finish the series and I'm accustomed to losing characters but I worry if the rest is going to be reading a trainwreck- its terrible thing to see, but you can't just turn away.

And no, I wouldn't really want to change the outcome of anything. Perhaps my post and ones like it are a testament of just how brilliant Martin is. But a simple ""Hey, things do get better"" would be nice.

The other parts, with Rhaegar as king, he says something like ""No, there is a third, the dragon has 3 heads"" referring to his kids, I'd guess that's talking about [Fan Theory](/g ""R+L=J"").

After that I knew I had to read the books, so between then and season 2 I read all the way up to the middle of ADWD and stopped when season 2 began. After it concluded I was extremely hesitant to continue reading, after all once I finished this book my time in Westeros would be at an end for quite some time. But 2 days ago I started it anyways, and now here I sit like the rest no new book in sight and a gaping void in my life. So lets talk Dance. First of all everyone that was saying how AFFC and ADWD were not as good are insane. While AFFC is slow yes, I will go out and say ADWD is close to being my favorite(still ASOS), I loved every chapter in it. Towards the end when the POV started changing quicker it was great. Dany RODE her FUCKING DRAGON!!! Speaking of that Khal Jhaqo is about to get his shit twisted up. They Ceasered Jon Snow all I could think was ""Et tu Bowen Marsh"". However I don't think he is dead Melisandre will either save him or resurrect him if he is dead. Stannis though worried about old Stannis the Mannis. You guys think he is dead,or holed up in a cave, surrounded by dead men for food and warmth, muttering "" they will bend the knee, or I'll destroy them""? Who do you guys think Azhor Ahai is, i'm not sure on that. Is Victarion born amidst salt(the sea) and smoke(what Moqorro did to his arm). Also when are some of these Red Priest going to actually meet?  Since I do believe R+L=J I thought he was The Prince Who Was Promised. However Varys made a compelling case for Aegon at the end, poor Kevan Lannister I actually liked him. Also where is Davos? When that fat guy bought Tyrion was anyone else thinking ""please don't try to rape them, please don't try to rape them""? So I know the Dunk and Egg tales are my next read, anyone have any good recommends after that. I'm thinking of reading 'Prince of Thorns"" anyone in GoT land read that, is it good?

There was a fun thread last year that tried to guess the episode titles, and guesses ranged from correct (""Valar Morgulis""), to reasonable but wrong (""Weasel Soup""), to not-so-reasonable (""Shadow Assassins from Mel's Vagina"").

What do you think for Season 3?  I'd be willing to put some money down on ""Dracarys.""

I guess as any Stark fan (i love the Starks, but i do also love others) it's nice to decipher a little hidden, not-sure-if-intentional message.

**[Extra about Epilogue]**

Also, the Epilogue is even more epicly awesome for Varys, after reading that, i feel like i never even knew Varys, it was like **BAM HEADSHOT, you weren't expecting that were 'ya??** Also the fact he doesn't want peace (or *that* peace) reminds me of our day and age corruption and how when someone reaches for peace, they end up dead (Possible exageration but you get me).

I've been giddy with excitement because I finally get to read the SoS spoiler tags on this subreddit, and I keep seeing everyone referring to her as ""Zombie Catelyn.""

My question is, how the hell did she get revived? Did she ever die? Did necromancy bring her back to life? If so, who did it? And if she is a zombie, why can she remember things from the Wedding?

[Possible Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/xbzmo/is_there_anyone_you_dislike_possible_spoilers/,[deleted],1343542185,"This is a strongly opinionated subject, be respectful!

A Song of Ice and Fire is a wonderfully crafted series filled with some great characters. What makes the series so amazing is the viewer's omnipotence in the plight of all the characters. George R.R Martin's writing allows us to feel the fervent opinions and thoughts of his creations, and evaluate them for ourselves. Not to mention the plot and the world is totally awesome.

I find that it's easy to say ""I just love all of these characters!"" It's harder to say who you dislike, I find. That may just be me, but there has to be another side to discussion rather than just lionizing the entire cast.

But there's a difference between disliking someone, and finding someone annoying. I'll use Catelyn. Catelyn, I find annoying. Ever since she said ""It should have been you."" to Jon, I've found her to be such a drag in the stories. I didn't think her chapters were that exciting, and her motherly nature and constant scrutiny and concern kind of a downer. Maybe my reasoning isn't the best, but I found Catelyn kind of irksome. But, I still like her as a character. Her instincts and opinions as a mother are very realistic, and I respect the depth of her character and the ability to annoy me so, somewhat like a real mother?

But the characters I dislike I find theatrical flaws with, I suppose.

Jon Snow, for example. I know he's a fan-favorite, but I don't like him. My reason: He's just too good. Since the story began, everything has been slanted in his favor, maybe not plot, but he's been glorified in the eyes of the reader far too much. We sympathize with him being the outcast, or the bastard, and all the hate he gets for it from others. He's skilled with a sword. He's handsome. He gets a cool direwolf.

He does no wrong. While he fears for being antagonized for [ASOS](/b ""sleeping with the enemy""), it's an argument that's easily shifted for Jon's favor in the eyes of the reader. There's nothing really to hate him for, which would seem to make a perfect character, but after coming to appreciate the balance of negative and positive qualities in all of the characters of the series, Jon just makes me kind of angry. I tried to argue myself, saying that he perhaps is a bit timid, but I find that's more in the show than in the book series. He's too cool and collected, and he's too much a heroic figure.

I love the characters that undergo transformations; characters that I can despise at first and love later. Jon does undergo transformations, but he's still just too unsullied for me. That's my opinion, at least.

I don't like Bran either. But that's just cause he complains a lot, I find his chapters boring and they usually begin and end with him crying. No change really until ADWD. Most of his chapters just end in disappointment. When I reread the series, I skipped most of them. I don't have as good a reason for disliking Bran. haha.

I love the series. A lot. I'm not dissing Martin or anything. I think if you really love a series or a book and you've read it as much as I have, you see a few negatives.

George R.R Martin's writing is a masterpiece of perspective, and I'd like to hear your perspective on all the interesting characters, positive or negative.",18,6,False,default,,,,,

Jon Snow: Lord Commander of the nights watch, with an army of wildlings at his command. PRESUMED dead, yes, but how many times has Martin kileld someone, only to be like ""PSYCH!!! JK, they're alive.""?

Sansa Stark: Being helped by Littlefinger to become the lady of the Vale, and thus able to lead one of only two armies in Westeros that has not been affected by war. 

Arya Stark: Getting major assassin, face changing, and spiritual training. She could do work in some major role

Brandon Stark: Being taught by a motha fucking GREENSEER and Children of the Forest!!

So, here's my prediction. Sansa stark will take her army from the vale and rally all the lords of the Riverlands and the North to her banner, extinguishing the line of Freys and Boltons who betrayed her brother. Jon Snow, or whoever commands the Wall, will hold against a White Walker attack, while Bran leads an army of Children armed with Obsidian weapons to take them from the rear. Daenerys will lead her army of Unsullied and Freedmen, her Dragons, and the Golden Company, and destroy the power of House Lannister and High Garden; accompanied by her mentors and councilors Tyrion and Samwell. She will then ride on her Dragons to salvage the battle with the White Walkers in the North, which probably won't be going well for the living.

The spice merchant was killed by Xaro and Pree, so his ships are available. Qarth is leaderless, excessively wealthy, and presumably incredibly vulnerable.

I can't imagine why Dany would need to get bogged down in the slave cities now. All she really needs to do is collect the Unsullied (if she really needs them at all). Or has HBO made a nonsensical botch of her story as they did Robb's?

In a perfect world, when Jon Snow is repeatedly stabbed at the end of ADWD he survives (possibly from wearing mail?). When Daenerys finally gets around to flying Drogon over to Westeros, with her first stop being the wall since the others will be attacking by then, Jon Snow will ride one of her dragons. If a dragon can be brought across the narrow sea without a rider, he must be a rider. I feel at this point it will be revealed in fact that Jon Snow was Prince Rhaegar's and Lyanna Stark's child. As having dragon's blood in him he will make a perfect fit. 

This however leaves ghost out and would be too perfectly awesome for Martin to make the story unfold this way and he's probably dead from the stabbing, which would be most unfortunate. Thoughts?",3,0,False,default,,,,,

As I haven't read ADWD yet, some of these things may  be answered later on.

Any way.

1. Prophecies. They seem to always be right, but hard to decipher. Example, Dany sees a man with a wolf head standing inside a room with dead bodies all around him. I thought this was some kind of figurative prophecy of one of the Starks (Robb probably, as he was called the young wolf, or maybe Jon Snow, as he seems to be a warg) winning a title, but then I got to the point of the Red Wedding and I realized that it was actually a a quite litteral vision of what happened. This is just an example of how litteral most prophecies are in the books, and many times GRRM puts the answer so much right in front of our eyes that we can't see it but start to look elsewhere. I was halfway through ASOS when I realized how ADWD would probably end (I haven't read the ending yet of course, but reading AFFC just confirms my suspicions.) It all goes to prophecies again. Melisandress ones to be specific. She basically sees in the fire that a king/ruler born from storms and dragonstone would rule the kingdom. She actually does say that you have to interpretate the flames the right way, but is none the less Certain of that Stannis is this King (He is from the stormlands and lord of Dragonstone.) She seems to have totaly forgotten that there is another character called ""Stormborn"" that was born on Dragonstone, during a storm. Not going further in on that, to avoid people having to spoil things for others (as well as me, should I be wrong.) In AFFC there are also prophecies, mostly Cerceis, and she would seem to have missintreputated all of them. One being that A younger fairer queen would take her kingdom and all she holds dear. She's afraid this queen would be Margery... and the other that her little brother would kill her, which has made her fear Tyrion, allthough I am pretty certain of that it will be Jamie that does it in the end, she fears the wrong people all the time. 

2. A little speculation that I've got. About Jon Snow. I'm starting to think that he is not at all Ned's son, but rather Lyannas. There are many things that made me believe this. It was when Robb married I finally came to the conclusion that Jon can't be Ned's. In the books it would seem as if though Robb marries her mainly because of that he had already been with her, sacrificing his own honor to save hers. And he is his fathers son. So, say that Jon was actually the child of Lyanna and Rhaegar. Ned would know that Robert would kill Jon should he find out that he was the son of his beloved Lyanna and Rhaegar. And, thus sacrifices his own honor to save the one of his sister/Jon's life. ",14,3,False,self,,,,,

Dawn was the great sword of Ser Arthur Dayne, the most renowned knight of the seven kingdoms. It is the ancestral sword of House Dayne. It is claimed by the Daynes that the sword was forged from a fallen meteorite. The sword is described by Eddard Stark as ""pale as milkglass and alive with light."" Since Stark barely remembers the faces of his friends who died at the Tower of Joy skirmish it must be a quite a remarkable sword to be remembered in such detail. In another recollection of the sword, Ser Jaime remembers how the Smiling Knight desired to have Ser Arthur's ""white sword."" Dawn had also notched the Smiling Knight's sword which is very uncommon. There is one other sword that matches this description and it was wielded by an Other in the prologue of Game of Thrones. That sword too is described as alive with light and white. Could it be that sword of the Daynes was actually forged by the Others? The sword could have come to them as a spoil of war of during the War for Dawn. The sword could have been melted down and alloyed with normal steel to make the greatsword Dawn. What do you think? I have only read the first three books till now and have not seen the show. So perhaps there might be an argument against this theory?",38,35,False,self,,,,,
