I also love how the chapter after RW had all of Joffrey's elders putting Joff in his place (which made me think. Sansa is technically Joff's aunt now...EW.)

*speaking of which, Tywin is a classic politician ('Yeah, I was conspiring with Walder Frey and let Gregor Clegane off the leash, but I didn't *tell them* to do **exactly** what they did.').

*Man, 2 kings dead, one to go. And seeing how everyone in Joff's court pretty much hate each other, R'hllor seems to be really coming through. I mean, he got Stannis to *laugh*.

*And damn, Davos is getting down business. At least there was some good news in the midst of the rest of the reading I did today. I fear for him for the same reason though...

Some tips: Use initials, like RW, or an insignificant quote (my personal favorite) when you're posting about a specific event.

I know this sub is less strict than r/asoiaf, but I'm sure many readers love coming here anyways and would like them to feel safe reading the titles of posts at least. So remember, don't use spoilers in your titles and mark which book(s) there may be spoilers for.

Davos' ship was destroyed, right? And the last we hear of him he's being swept down the river toward the chain that Tyrion's men raised. Am I supposed to assume he's dead, or did I miss something?

Also: WTF Renly coming back from the dead?! He was mentioned leading a group of men to fight Stannis, then never spoke of again for the rest of the book. 

Lastly: I never liked Theon, but I never knew he would be such a dick to the point of killing children. Probably the saddest part of the book was Bran, Rickon, Osha and the Reeds finding Maester Luwin still alive though, I was so worried he'd died without knowing the Stark boys were still alive. :'(

I think I realised about 5 minutes into the first episode that it was going to be one of my all-time favourite shows.

I am now faced with a dilemma.  To read the books or not to read the books?  On the one hand I want to continue the story, whilst on the other I am worried that by reading the books I am less likely to enjoy the new episodes when they finally come out as I will already know what is to come.

So my question is this:  Do those who watched the show first and then read the books regret their decision?  Do you feel like you have lessened the anticipation for new episodes?  Or have the books done the opposite and given you something to look forward to?  

I don't think I've faced this problem before.  I can think of plenty of movies I've watched where I've already read the books, but in those cases it was usually the books I got into first and so the movie just added a little extra flavour (e.g. The HP books, LotR books).  An ongoing TV show (and a damn good one at that) is a slightly different beast.

Advice and guidance will be very much appreciated!  Just no spoilers please!

(possible spoilers on all books),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/m67ad/who_is_the_best_oneonone_fighter_in_the_asoiaf/,A_Polite_Noise,1320855230,"I just thought this would be a fun discussion to have, even though a few of the warriors of the books are not seen fighting and we only hear of their prowess.


It seems that **Arthur Dayne** is considered one of, if not the best swordsman to ever roam Westeros.  The fact that it seems that **Eddard Stark** was one of two survivors to face him and other skilled members of the Kingsguard of the Mad King implies that Eddard may be just as good if not better; I liked that the HBO show included a fight scene for him to show his talents.  Kingslayer was bravado and quick slashes, but Sean Bean's Eddard had a slow, methodical, calm paced fighting style that (without the intervention of the spear) made it seem he would definitely win.



One of my friends thinks that, despite not seeing him in action much, **Areo Hotah**,the captain of Doran Martell's guards, could potentially be one of the deadliest men in Westeros.  While the Kingsguard he faced was not known as being a very skilled warrior as far as I know, the implications of his training and sleeping with his axe tells of a highly trained and committed fighter.



The **Sand Snakes** are certainly implied to be very dangerous, and as offspring of **The Red Viper** I imagine some are quite skilled at one-on-one combat.





As far as military commanders, **Robert Baratheon** may not have been a perfect king, and he may have been a bit emotional and impulsive on the battlefield (as well as prone to bloodlust), but he was a charismatic general who used great strength and fast movement to his advantage.




Of course, **Tywin Lannister**, a smart man who always commands battles from the rear, knows his forces and enemy forces very well, and isn't one to waste strength.  A sensible though brutal man, it seemed he had a touch of pride (which he earned) that blinded him to Robb's plan in the first book, but it was very slight; he usually seemed to weigh his opponents accurately.



**Jon Connington**, from what little details we were given about his battle leadership, certainly has victories and pedigree behind him; hard living away from Westeros as a leader of sellswords could only have honed his skills moreso.




These are just a few examples I'm throwing out there; I'm sure I'm missing some obvious ones, but I just wanted to get the discussion-ball rolling =)  What do you all think?





Edit:  As soon as I posted I realized that I should probably also include **Arya Stark** in this list; she may not have the size and strength to face a swordsman like the Kingslayer in his prime, or a warrior of the sheer size of The Mountain, but if you consider the assassin skills she has acquired, she could sneak up on and kill many of the strongest and best warriors of the series; I wouldn't exactly call that one-on-one battle...it's an assassination and not exactly combat, but I felt the list lacked women besides the Sandsnakes (and with so many strong female characters in the series that felt unfair), and Brienne is too wild and unfocused a fighter, despite her strength and will, for me to put her amongst these others.  


Oh!  Jeez!  And even as I type Arya, the most obvious of the female warriors, **Asha Greyjoy** comes screaming into my mind (wielding two axes and a wicked libido).  I can't believe I forgot her; certainly a tenacious and skilled fighter, but perhaps with too much to prove (much like Brienne, and for that matter, the Kingslayer) which can work against you in battle.

----

I haven't finished book 5 yet. I actually just started it.

A friend of mine, however, is reading book 2 right now. I was talking to him about how book 4 got split into books 4 and 5, and how it might be possible to read both books concurrently to get a better experience.

Firstly, is this possible? Are the books truly 100% concurrent? If so, then book 5 shouldn't talk about any of the events of book 4. At least not until the very end.

While reading book 4 I missed the plots of Tyrion, Daenerys, Bran, etc. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was one large book.

Has anyone heard of someone trying to read the books this way? Has anyone ever seen or heard of such a guide? If not, would anyone like to work on one? I don't imagine it would be very hard. For the most part the plot lines are entirely separate. Perhaps reading one chapter at a time from each book would suffice. That is, unless the number of chapters in each book are very different.",3,1,False,default,,,,,

I think this could function really well as an MMO or a very open RPG. You could start out as a hedge knight, or a son/daughter in a lesser house/user created house. I think this would be the best route as it would allow players to carve out their own story in Westeros that could run parallel to the main story (as seen in the books and TV series).


You complete tasks/missions to earn renown and gain a reputation for your house. Win honor or infamy through the use military strategy, competing in tournaments, negotiating treaties, or marrying into power. Toward the end of the game it could allow the player to take part in the battles and politics that take place in the established story lines.


This is my take, I would be interested in hearing what other people's thoughts are on combining the ASOIAF lore with video games. I've got a few more ideas, but I'd like to hear some of yours first.",16,9,False,default,,,,,

What I have so far:

""The white swords had come to welcome a new brother to their ranks"" - Jaime

""The storm lord was on hand"" - Robert?

The king - Aerys (mad king)

dragonprince - Rhaegar

Rose Lord - Some Tyrell - Mace? Or Loras, Garon, or Willas. I forget where willas was crippled by a dornishman
""The great lion had quarreled with the king and stayed away"" - Tywin over Jamie being knighted to the white knights

daughter of harrehall - king's mistress (named queen of love and beauty)

who was lord of harrenhall at this time?

famous uncle of the daughter of harrenhall was a white knight - which one?

wife of the dragonprince - elia

she-wolf - lynna??

wild wolf - brandon stark

quiet wolf - eddard stark

wolf pup - ?? no idea

""maid with laughing purple eyes (who is this?) danced with a white sword a red snake"" - the red viper? Oberyn? probably where he unhorses willas and cripples him

the lord of griffins - we should know this but i dont think hes important in the story

There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice,
despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of
our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple
folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until
the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad,
they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a
sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips
of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. Theyve
heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders
they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the
greatest most of them will ever know.

Then they get a taste of battle.

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they
lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a
hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die,
fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after
theyve been gutted by an axe.

They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they
are his now. They take a wound, and when thats still half-healed they take another.
There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes
are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad
water.

If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need
to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from
the smallfolk whose lands theyre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be.
They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there its just a short step
to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their
friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that
they hardly recognize. They dont know where they are or how to get back home and
the lord theyre fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting
for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes,
to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in
steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world . . .


And the man breaks.

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away
in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by
then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that
will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few
hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man.
Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken
men, and fear them . . . but he should pity them as well.""",38,118,False,self,,,,,

Robb 'betrayed' Lord Frey, and he acted pretty well within character for the scumbag old man.

Melisandre seems convinced that she was the cause of these deaths (or rather R'hllor was), but every other time we have seen some of the R'hllor magic, it has had a very direct cause/effect relationship (shadow baby assassination, reviving Lord Beric, etc.).

Please be gentle as I have yet to see my first winter...

* Jon Snow - While Jon is a bastard, I do not think he is the bastard that the readers are lead to believe he is. I believe he is the son of [Speculation](/? ""Lyanna and Rhaegar""). Yes I do think he is [Speculation](/? ""Danerys' nephew, making him one of the last dragons. The promise that Eddard makes to Lyanna is to keep Jon safe from the ruthless killings of the war, and to raise him as his own"").

* Theon Greyjoy - while I did not get this sense from reading the book, I believe the show makes this more apparent during the [TV Spoiler](/s ""rape (?) scene with the wildling in Winterfell""). I think Theon is a much more ambitious character that the Starks think him to be. I think he will end up [Speculation](/? ""betraying Robb to make a name for himself""). Maybe that is a bad way to say it, but I think he will want to outgrow his role as steward to the Starks in a meaningful way.

* Sansa Stark - I expect Sansa's story to be about seeing beyond simple perception. Throughout most of GOT she acts the stereotypical princess, but begins to see things differently since [Spoiler](/s ""Eddard's beheading""). I think she will make a friendship with [Speculation](/? ""the hound, and may even develop a romantic relationship with him""). Call me crazy, but I think there has been some setup for this to happen.

Beyond the above characters, I don't have any theories. Of course there will be more adventuring and character development, but nothing that stood out to me while reading/watching.

Those who have only read the first book, what do you expect?
Veterans, what say you to my theories?

Hell, Skyrim was [*almost*](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/bethesdas-todd-howard-on-turning-down-a-chance-to-make-a-song-of-fire-and-ice-titles/) an ASOIAF game I couldn't resist making a character or two based off of some of the characters in the books and in the show. Here's what I've made so far:

*Eddard*

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993455361/screenshot/650997586421874961?tab=public

[TV Spoiler](/s ""Now with special ""head"" attachment!"") I'm the proudest of this one so far. A two-handed, heavy armored Nord warrior with a side of smithing and speech. Honorable warrior siding with the Stormcloaks and joined the Companions [Skyrim Companions spoiler](/s ""and has a werewolf affliction for when I want to let loose. Thought it was fitting."") Still looking for that rumored wolf companion.

*Rhaego* (GoT spoiler in the link)

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993455361/screenshot/650997586421993036/?tab=public

[TV Spoiler](/s ""OK, so this concept is a little.... disturbing. He's an Argonian assassin with a love for horses. Kinda had to use my imagination a bit, but an Argonian matched Mirri's description perfectly besides the missing wings. I have to admit, I did not plan for this one to be based off GoT at first, but the name ""Rhaego"" sounded at least a little bit Argonian, so I stuck with it."")

*Rhaegar*

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993455361/screenshot/650997586422901363

This is my interpretation of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. I've sunk the most time into this character, as you can see from his Dragonbone Armor. He's a Breton battlemage (Dragonskin was a perfect choice for a racial ability!) with an aptitude for Conjuration, Destruction, and one-handed conjured weapons with a side of smithing and enchanting. The hair was as silvery as I could make it, and there was no option for purple eyes, but I got as dark blue as I could. A lot of fanart pictures Rhaegar with no facial hair, but I think facial hair makes him look a bit more battle-hardened and experienced.

Let's see what you've got guys!

It no longer works.**  It's failing here as well as on my CSS testing subreddit, and appears to be a change in the way Reddit is parsing link tags.  

I've submitted a bug report/fix request to Reddit, but until the problem is resolved the code will not work.  **That means all old posts with that tag now have uncovered speculation spoilers.** So be very careful where you click right now.

I'll set up a new speculation tag for new posts right now.  I'll post the syntax shortly.

----
**UPDATE:** It's confirmed as a Reddit-wide update yesterday.  They have [changed the markdown interpreter](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mg1j6/reddit_change_new_markdown_interpreter/), and the new version auto-links subreddits.  So the spoiler tags with /x are no longer being treated as normal links.  I've asked for fix options like a way to turn off the feature, but **for now please use the additional new speculation tag:**

    [Speculation](/t ""your text"")

Hopefully there won't be more updates that break all of the spoiler tags :/

----
**UPDATE 2:** I've been told the Reddit admins will be add an exception for ? as a valid link character to the new parsing code, and once that's in place all the old speculation tags should work again.  **That update will likely go live early next week**, so till then please be careful about where you click.  

To head off future issues, I'm changing the ""official"" character for speculation tags to ""t"" (for theory) so that going forward all the characters are generic alphas.  Future changes to Reddit may still break the tags, but at least it'll be a consistent all or nothing situation to deal with. The old /? tag will still be supported forever to maintain old posts.

----
**UPDATE 3:** We're having a mods discussion at the moment about whether to change that /t to something else, mainly because with the TV spoilers using /s it seems potentially confusing to have the speculation spoilers use /t.  A decision on that will be announced soon.

----
**UPDATE 4:** New tag is /g for ""guess.""  Please use that going forward.

My vote: Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister

He pulled off the cold, calculating, and intimidating Tywin Lannister perfectly.

Runner up: Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon

He captured the flawed but likable nature of Baratheon. This scene stands out for me.

So, constantly thought the series, and especially in the first book, the concept of ""The Game Of Thrones"" is harped upon. ""You win, or you die."" Never mentioned, however are the players. Sure you have people who think they are, like Cersei and Lord Bolton, Jamie and many others. But think of the game of thrones as a game of chess. You have your pieces, from rooks to pawns, to bishops and kings and queens. All of these pieces are just tools, means to an end for the players. Who is sitting at the opposite ends of the board? My thoughts are to Varys and Littlefinger. Both are master manipulators, both have hordes of spies, and both have had clear effects on the game from behind the scenes. Varys plays for the realm, which is in his mind the return of the Targaryens; whilst Baelish plays for himself and his own gain. Look at the facts. Varys has been there since his start. He served the Dragon Kings when it served him, jumped ship when he had to, yet still worked his hardest to allow the Dragons to arise again. We know he killed Kevan Lannister, we also know that he knew of the plots to kill Jon Arryn and Ned Stark, but he was content to allow the lesser players kill off their own pieces. Littlefinger single-handedly sparked off the War of the Kings by claiming  his dagger had been lost to Tyrion in a bet. From then on he amassed his power base, manipulated the events that lead to the death of Joffery, and went of to control the Vale of Arryn. It's clear that his eyes are on the throne, and he's done a thousand different acts to try and get there. So, that's my speculation, I'd like to hear if anyone agrees, or thinks that I'm reading too much into it. ",41,10,False,self,,,,,

The last three spoilers piss me off the most because I know how awesome and shocking it would've been if I had read that in the book.

Anyway, my questions:  
-Is it all true? (If not (or not entirely) *please* don't correct, explain or specify anything)  
-Are there any exciting, surprising and game changing twists and/or events I still have to look forward to? 

I really lost interest after reading all that and while I know that the book is still gonna be pretty good, I need something to get and keep me excited right now. You would really do me a favor by answering the questions above. Thanks in advance.

I have only read the first book, but it seems that there has been several thousand years of ""High Medieval Era"" equivalent society?

How long have armoured knights been the dominant military force? In our own history it was about 300 years; from 1100 until the invention of the longbow and crossbow in the 14th C and pike-wielding heavy infantry.

Why do the Free Cities have a Renaissance-era sword fighting style (with rapiers sans armor) if they don't have gunpowder?

And also, why does naval technology seem to have stagnated with viking longboat types equivalent? Nobody has thought to mount rudders on the stern or use more than one mast?

I like the book a lot, but the setting is a frustrating caricature of medieval society. In reality, the Middle Ages were a period of rapid technological change that laid the framework for the rise of nation-states and the age of exploration. In GoT, it's like some sort of Victorian-era medieval romance.",39,0,False,self,,,,,

(SPOILERS all books + speculation),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/mnl7j/who_sent_the_letter_to_jon_spoilers_all_books/,kjhatch,1322111836,"This is about the letter sent to Jon in ADWD by Ramsay Bolton.  The topic came up in an [earlier discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/mmrdg/jon_snow_adwd_spoilers/c325tmf), but as I was typing up a reply I thought it would be better to post a new thread for more notice to see what you all thought about it too.

Did Ramsay actually send the letter?  Or was it someone else just pretending?  There's been a lot of fan speculation all over the place suggesting that various major characters might have sent it: Ramsay, Mance, Stannis, Theon, Asha, Roose, Manderly, and even Melisandre.  So who's your pick and why?

My guess is it's Mance.  Yes Ramsay could have tortured info out of him to form that letter, but parts of the letter don't work together.  Like if Stannis is dead and his forces broken, why would Ramsay need the Queen and Stannis' daughter? Why would he care at all about Val or Mance's son if he already has Mance in a cage and is offering him to Jon? Why did Ramsay not send along some flayed skin with the letter as proof of Stannis or Mance?  And really why would he want Jon to come down from the Wall at all?  Isn't he capable of finding a few lost prisoners?

Mance on the other hand is a known trixter and could benefit from Jon's help if he's in a tight spot.  He would want his own kin certainly, and if he needs to bargain with the not-dead Stannis then having Stannis' family would help with that.  The repeated line about ""Arya"" escaped would also drive home the idea that Mance succeeded in his mission. 

Here's the letter for reference:

&gt; *Your false king is dead, bastard. He and all his host were smashed in seven days of battle. I have his magic sword. Tell his red whore.*

&gt; *Your false kings friends are dead. Their heads upon the walls of Winterfell. Come see them, bastard. Your false king lied, and so did you. You told the world you burned the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Instead you sent him to Winterfell to steal my bride from me.*

&gt; *I will have my bride back. If you want Mance Rayder back, come and get him. I have him in a cage for all the north to see, proof of your lies. The cage is cold, but I have made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came with him to Winterfell.*

&gt; *I want my bride back. I want the false kings queen. I want his daughter and his red witch. I want his wildling princess.*

&gt; *I want his little prince, the wildling babe. And I want my Reek. Send them to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your black crows. Keep them from me, and I will cut out your bastards heart and eat it.*

This is obviously an issue for Littlefinger, so Ramsay clearly won't be alive for much longer. I'm guessing he somehow winds up in the hands of Theon, who will mind-battle Reek for what to do with him, before he just decides to be a better man and give him a regular death.

Since Littlefinger seems to be one of the ""Big Bads"", I'm guessing everything is going to get better for him, and he won't get commupance until book 7. Likely succeed in giving Winterfell to Sansa, put someone in charge of the Vale, and return to King's Landing to claim a reward from the Tyrells (for his role in Joffrey's death). He'll finally garrison Harrenhall and probably wind up with Storm's End.

The High Sparrow knows about Jaime, so he'll likely be sent to the Wall, and he'll be the PoV character for there eventually.

I'm guessing Stannis is going to die, either now or book 7. Melisandre is going to revive Jon (although maybe not until the end), and Jon will be free from the watch (since the oath is until death). Melisandre and Jon will take over Stannis' army(or at least the wueen's men), and I see Jon being the one to kill Catelyn.

I think Arya is going to get a mark for the someone in Winterfell, maybe the lord, and will meet Sansa. She'll end up having to choose between Arya and Faceless.

I think [Charles Dance](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001097/) is a great actor who has done a fantastic job portraying the character, he just doesn't LOOK the part. I don't have the text in front of me, but i clearly remember Tywin described as having a completely bald head and thick golden sideburns. I felt that was an important bit of characterization because as soon as he started to lose his hair, he ordered it completely shaven. No halfways. No Japes. A number of artists representations ([1](http://www.geekshow.us/wp/wp-content/uploads/Tywin.jpg), [2](http://fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/agotlcg/TywinLannister_lg.png), [3](http://www.miniaturenland.de/images/1447_1.jpg), [4](http://agot9players.free.fr/Cards/House/Lannister/Tywin-Lannister.jpg)) show Tywin as looking the way he is described, but they completely ignored that issue in the show. Was there a reason for this? It seems like they could have even used Charles Dance and spent more time on hair/makeup. I mean, when he first appeared in the show, I didn't even recognize who he was supposed to be at first.

Just something that bugged me a bit and I hadn't heard anyone else mention. Thoughts?

EDIT: Based on the responses I think people missed my point. I mentioned that I thought Dance did a GREAT job portraying the character.

That is, the major events that have characterized this world have occurred on the continents other than Westeros.

First line of evidence: Westeros has been repeatedly conquered from across the narrow sea.  Whether it be the First Men, the Andals, or the ~~Rhollar~~ Rhoynar, or the Targaryens, Westeros repeatedly finds itself outmatched with powers to the East.  It looks as though the cycle may even repeat itself.

Second line of evidence: It appears as though the lands to the east have seen the rise and fall of even more empires and kingdoms than Westeros. [DwD](/b ""When Tyrion is moving down the Rhoynar with Griff they pass through the shattered hulks of many cities.  These seem to span thousands of years and have been subject to numerous rise and falls and conquests.  This may even be confirmed with the abandoned cities in the wastelands just to the NE of Slaver's Bay"")

The counterargument is that Westeros is the center of the mother of all battles: basically all living creatures against the Others.  One major battle that could have led to eternal darkness was already fought there, and it looks as though the second is coming shortly.

Tyrion is who I'd like to discuss. It seems to me that he is actually the main character, if GRRM actually created one. Certainly, my heart is saddened for Eddard and I cheer for Robb. I root for Anya and loathe characters like Cersei, Jaime and Joffrey. But, Tyrion seems to be the main character.

He shows up everywhere and in almost every storyline. He has wit and is crafty and when things go south for him, he usually gets his way. Now, I'm not saying I like him because I don't like him at all. But, as to being an essential part of the story, he is indisposable!

My mother is absolutely OBSESSED with the ""Song of Ice and Fire,"" I am a fan as well, but I have nothing on her. For Christmas I want to bombard her with gifts that have to do with the series. 

Obviously I am google-ing extensively for the most popular gifts, but there is one thing that I am coming up short on, and it's the one thing she wants more than anything. My mother would love an extremely accurate map containing all the lands referenced in the books, so not just Westeros, but also north of the wall and of the eastern continent. Ideally, it would be something I could get printed, even if it was huge.

Everything my mother and I have googled so far in our quest to find the map has disappointed her. I was hoping someone more experienced with the fan community behind these books could direct me to a map that might be useful.
