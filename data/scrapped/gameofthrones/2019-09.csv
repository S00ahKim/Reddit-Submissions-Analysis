Links appreciated!

The last book hasn't come out, so I wanted to put my theory out there and shed some light on all the unexplained which left so many frustrated with the tv series end. Hopefully some of this is explained/validated in the final book. The possibility of being correct is why I chose to head with Spoiler.

About 5 years ago I had no social life and read each book back to back. I was certain Bran would 'win' (and subsequently won a good deal of bets as a result ;) ). Here is why:

Let's consider the following: Westeros rightfully belongs to the original people called the 'little people' (briefly touched upon in an episode), who were slaughtered along with their trees to near extinction by the invaders. I believe the trees have/had souls  (shoutout to Tolkien) and are perhaps a facet/extension of the three eyed raven's soul itself. Their grimaces are a perpetual reminder of the genocide. 

The invaders 'throne' was little more than a sham and political move to claim what was never theirs and the original people forgotten. As long as the three eyed raven (God of Westeros) lived, the true 'king' remained. Prior to Westeros' invasion they lived in peace with each other and the lands. This is clearly implied in the books. It also explains Bran's disinterest in being in complete power. It had never been their way to have a hierarchy, bicker and kill one another over petty matters. 

The Night King and his army were a group who rose up against the three eyed raven, perhaps discovering sorcery to improve their capabilities, wield harm and perhaps make their souls immortal(?) (hence the return?). Similar to Satan's fall from grace, the Night King and his army turned against God in a will to power through reckless violence.

Bran: God. Peaceful, all knowing, wise, patient.

Night King: Satan. Evil, violent, insatiable appetite for power.

Bran's right to the throne is especially obvious in the final scene. Why would the Night King go for Bran and not storm south to Circe, wreaking havoc along the way (as so many of us hoped for!?)? Because he knew that as long as Bran lived on he could never truly take power. He would be evading his inevitable doom for a short period of time. He went for Bran because he was the only person in Westeros who mattered.

I'm guessing the Raven had banished the Night King's army to hell after battle (remaining undead in frozen graves/purgatory)  prior to the invasion of Westeros. The few remaining were weakened by their battle with the Night King, vulnerable to invasion, couldn't possibly fight the invaders so they fled into hiding. All the while the raven knew the day would come the army would arise again and awaited the final battle. I could go in circles thinking of possibilities. The most frustrating thing for me is that there was no closure as to the army's origins or beef with the little people and Bran. Maybe Martin is saving the juicy details for the book. 

I do agree the last season was handled poorly. Many details overlooked, backstories remain mysterious. The 2nd to last series void of any real meaning to the plot, and IMO a complete waste of time. The finale was sloppy, rushed and full of letdowns. Here's to hoping Martin actually finishes the book and the series as he intended. Until then it looks like we're all sleeping white walkers.",19,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

But after going back to River run, he was too far now and had to cross the Twins to get to kings landing fast enough. So really his biggest mistake was simply the need to backtrack for a funeral.

Also , the fact that he was so far from kings landing at this point , he decided to go after casterly rock which was closer to the twins/river run than kings landing was.

He should have kept pushing at harrenhol to kings landing, possibly stopping at some of the houses that were fed up with the New King to get some new allies instead of trying to keep peace with allies that were getting annoyed by his ddecisions (Karstarks/Freys/Boltons)",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Spoilers abound.

&gt;!Now that a few months have past since the conclusion of Game of Thrones, it is worth taking a moment to reassess how it ended, and frankly, to assign blame for an unfortunate and terrible ending.  David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have so far been the goats in this story (dropping out of a Comic-Con panel, for example, to avoid the contempt of the crowd) and while they deserve some blame they deserve some pity too.  And there is another wrongdoer in this story as well.!&lt;

&gt;!The popular and critical consensus was the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones was its worst, and that its last episode, The Iron Throne was the worst, by far, of that season and of the series as a whole.  IMDB.com rates Game of Thrones as a whole at 9.4, while the highest rated episode of the eighth season, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms received a 7.9 rating, and The Iron Throne received an abysmal 4.2. By contrast, the lowest rated episode of season seven was Dragonstone at 8.6. The lowest rated episode in the entire history of the show, outside of season eight, was Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken in season five, at a still relatively healthy 8.0.  Just to put a point on that, the lowest rated episode of any non-season eight episode was higher rated than the highest rated episode of season eight.   And IMDB.com was certainly not alone in reflecting this displeasure. See here, here and here (soft paywall) for some representative samples of the critical and popular reactions. !&lt;

&gt;!These failings have been squarely laid at the feet of the series showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. Critics have savaged their dialogue, pacing, plotting, and the decisions to cut the last two seasons down to 13 episodes from the expected 20. Certain plotlines were called out for particular displeasure, such as the Ghoul Quest, where several key heroes, including Jon Snow, made an incredibly dangerous and ultimately pointless quest to seize a still living wight.  That quest not only did not achieve its goal (Cersei still refused to aid the heroes in their fight against the NIght King) but also cost them a dragon when Daenerys mounted the inevitable rescue mission. That any character with a lick of sense (Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys) would have seen the obvious pointlessness of Ghoul Quest from jump was skipped over.!&lt;

&gt;!While there is plenty of blame to go round for the many missteps in the series last two seasons, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss should not bear it alone. !&lt;

&gt;!I am going to focus oh the last episode, although a complete review of the last season, or even the series of the whole, is warranted.  !&lt;

&gt;!This final episode, The Iron Throne was, in my opinion, calamitously bad. Its 4.2 IMDB rating is generous bad.  Its problems in my order from least to most offensive.!&lt;

&gt;!First, Daenerys dies a deserved death.  Daenerys heel turn comes to a brutal end as she is murdered by her lover and nephew and rival to the throne, Jon Snow.  Daeneryss villainy was, at best, underdeveloped; the black hat never felt like a natural fit on the Mother of Dragons.  That being said, this was a reasonably interesting piece of plotting that could have come off if given time to breathe.  As the capstone tragedy to the series of tragedies that made up Game of Thrones it could have been epic.  As it turned out, it was beautifully shot but unearned and out of place.  And this monumental moment was only the third most important thing to happen in this episode, which gives a pretty good sense of the narrative compression required to move so many pieces so quickly in the last two seasons.!&lt;

&gt;!Second, R+L = Jack Shit.  Jon Snows heritage, the secret of the series, a fact of enormous danger to the Realm, to his relationship to Daenerys, and not least to himself, turns out to carry the same dramatic import as a frosty conversation between Daenerys and Sansa.  The only use this carefully developed plot point has is to, mildly, increase Daeneryss distrust of the Starks. Thats it.  Daenerys never moves against Jon or, for that matter, any of the other Starks.  Theres never a breath of a suggestion that Jon will seek the throne for himself. It really makes you wonder what the Lord of Light saw in Jon that required his resurrection in the first place.  He was not the Prince that was Promised; not the slayer of the Night King; and never the King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men and the Lord of the Seven Realms.  In fact, the only act of any dramatic importance that Jon Snow takes part in after his resurrection (other than the murder of Daenerys mentioned above) is the Battle of the Bastards.  Even as to that, Jon Snows contributions were largely negative.  His most important decision was to set off the charge that could (and probably should) have resulted in the destruction of him and his army. It is remarkable that the character most readily identifiable as the hero of the series contributes so little of import in the last three seasons.  The contributions that he did make would more logically (and much more satisfyingly) been given to Sansa.  Maybe the Lord of Light really should have left Jon in the ground.!&lt;

&gt;!Highly relatedly, the narrative decision to privilege the conflict with Cersei over the war against the Night King created myriad narrative and structural problems.  By ending the way it did, the show effectively declared that the whole conflict among the humans, the Game of Thrones as it were, was what really mattered, and the primordial conflict with the Night King was just a tedious distraction from the real action which was, and always would be, at Kings Landing. Prioritizing the human conflict also broke the unity between the opening scenes and closing scenes of the series.  The weird encounter with the White Walkers that so memorably kicked off the series is not mirrored in the end, or even effectively explained. The hideous, ancient, powerful Big Bad Evil Guy becomes a secondary villain that can be killed off by a secondary hero. On that note, while the choice of Arya to wield the killing knife is a welcome feminist triumph, the indignity it foists on Jon Snow, who is literally hiding behind a rock while his kid sister disposes of the monster he was prophesized to defeat, should not be overlooked. Finally, ordering the climactic series of conflicts as first Night King (ancient evil threatening apocalyptic destruction of all human life), then Cersei (very evil but still human), and finally Daenerys ( a pretty good person going through a rough patch) virtually guaranteed that the series would limp its way to a conclusion. !&lt;

&gt;!Third, and by far the worst problem, and, in my view, the problem that renders the ending of series unsalvageable dreck, is the crowning of King Bran.  Wow.  Where to begin? Just the easiest and most obvious things. Theres no Iron Throne any more.  And notwithstanding the heartwarming scenes at the Small Council table following the coronation, theres not really a Red Keep or for that matter a Kings Landing left either. !&lt;

&gt;!So question number one, what is this person going to be king of? And, closely following that question, why do we need a Lord of the Seven Kingdoms at all?  Wouldnt it be the obvious, and politically sensible thing, for each of the Seven Kingdoms to simply go their own separate ways? Daenerys broke the Wheel, maybe not in the way she intended, but she did. No, clearly that cant happen, the Kingdom must go on, despite the fact that the new Queen of Iron Islands, Yara, had bargained for one thing in allying with Daenerys, which was independence for the Iron Islands.  And Dorne, which has been agitating for nothing but independence since the series started, well that mood has apparently come to an end.  But, oh, Queen Sansa of the North, shes not coming. Its going to be Six Kingdoms now. In connection with that startling announcement, it should be noted that the deposing of Jon Snow as King in the North does not warrant even a passing remark. That a man acclaimed king by every house in the North, who literally gave everything for his people, his life, his love, and his crown, should be removed from power by his own sister, is not even hinted as portending future political problems for the Queen of the newly independent North. But that howling void in the narrative is just a sideshow in this particular circus. The main act awaits.!&lt;

&gt;!Bran Stark is going to be king.!&lt;

&gt;!Why?!&lt;

&gt;!Because, well he has a good story.  Seriously, after eight seasons of nothing but good stories, every living character in the series has a right to the throne under such a theory.!&lt;

&gt;!Bran, prior to this episode, had never demonstrated any interest in being king. Bran has no claim to the throne of any kind, either Targaryen or Baratheon.  He certainly cannot claim it by right of conquest, as he had nothing to do with the defeat of Cersei or the death of Daenerys. He has led no armies, organized no alliances, schemed not a single visible scheme towards taking the throne.!&lt;

&gt;!But theres more! Not only does he lack any experience of any kind in politics, he lacks any ability to deal with people, even in the most basic ways.  He is a near-mute, who speaks largely in riddles.  And it is entirely unclear why the Three Eyed Raven, a mystical demi-god, would have any interest in holding a position in a human government in the first place. !&lt;

&gt;!Finally, last but definitely not least, who is going to support him once he is in office? The one source of power that he might have called upon, Jons Northern army, has departed with Sansa and for reasons just mentioned, she will need all of them.  He has no supporters in the city itself.  To the remaining citizens of Kings Landing, Bran might as well have landed from the moon.  Whatever civic institutions survived Drogons fire owe Bran no loyalty. !&lt;

&gt;!Nothing but a deus ex machina could put Bran on the throne or keep him there.  Now, the possibility is that Bran was the deus in his own machina and through his gift of foresight took the steps necessary to put himself on the throne.  But there is little narrative support for such an argument, although some have attempted to marshall it. And no less importantly, it fails to answer the most pressing question: why would a person/Three Eyed Raven capable of such feats want to exercise his powers to obtain something as useless as the charred pool of metal that is what remains of the Iron Throne?!&lt;

&gt;!We know who is responsible for this narrative calamity and it is neither Benioff nor Weiss but rather this person: \[Creators\] David \[Benioff\] and Dan \[Weiss\] told me there were two things \[author\] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king. So thats pretty special to be directly involved in something that is part of Georges vision. It was a really nice way to wrap it up. Isaac Hempstead Wright (played Bran on Game of Thrones). !&lt;

&gt;!So, George R.R. Martin made this decision, this terrible decision, and it was one that Benioff and Weiss either couldnt or wouldnt back away from. And this almost certainly wasnt the only Martin decision Benioff and Weiss respected.  Other sources reported that Benioff and Weiss learned the broad strokes of Martins ending, including the conclusions of each of the characters arcs.!&lt;

&gt;!With that in mind, you cant help but become more sympathetic to Benioff and Weiss.  They were saddled with a critical plot point, King Bran the Broken, that had no support in the narrative and which they had no earthly clue how to deliver. And if Martin, as appears to be the case, delivered in broad strokes the last acts of Daenerys, Cersei and Jamie Lannister, Jon Snow, Tyrion, Varys, etc. there would have been even less room to maneuver.  Moreover, they had the obligation to hit these marks while lacking the armature of Martins copiously written books to give them a clear path. For a pair of clearly talented and creative minds, this must have been a close to hellish experience. Responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in budget and the livelihoods of thousands, they had to press on.  One thinks of Peter Jackson white-knuckling through 400+ days of principal photography and three films in the Hobbit series after Guillermo Del Toro and his years of painstaking preparation was shown the exit. !&lt;

&gt;!Under these circumstances, 13 episodes instead of 20 was likely all they could stomach. Having nowhere else to go, a visually and dramatically interesting Ghoul Quest probably seemed pretty appealing, despite having absolutely no connection to the larger narrative.  And if it resulted in the Night King having a cool undead Dragon capable of shooting blue flames to destroy the Wall, all the better. Why not give the Night Kings dispatching to Arya, who had seen and survived so much, knowing that Jon Snow will shortly have to deliver his own fatal heart stab. Bron as King, Sansa as Queen of an independent North, every other power in the Seven Kingdoms cool with that, Jon heading up north to hang out at (or around?) the Wall? Cant explain it, not going to try.!&lt;

&gt;!While they are certainly not blameless, to a very substantial extent, and far more than has been credited to date, their hands were creatively tied.  !&lt;

&gt;!George R.R. Martin has two books and apparently all the time he wants to justify the creative decisions we have seen executed in The Iron Throne. I wish him, sincerely, the best of luck.!&lt;",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The first one was great. But the second and third just kind of drag. I dont feel like theres the suspense that show brought with major events. Jeor Mormont dying, Renly dying, Red Wedding, Oberyn, etc. Those events just kind of happen.

I usually dont have this kind of problem with other books. But I just think the show did everything up to S4 better. And the crazy amount of characters in the books kind of throws off any attachment to any of the side characters, unlike the show where characters like Bronn do a lot more and are easily attached to by the audience.

 According to an Entertainment Weekly interview, HBO was entirely willing to pay for more Game of Thrones, but Benioff and Weiss drew the line and wanted to wrap things up, presumably so they could move on to other projects, like their upcoming Star Wars trilogy and the controversial modern slavery series Confederate.

I defended them up until Season 8, but now that I see their lack of devotion to their Projects, my opinion on them has changed completely.

I knew if I did that, I wouldn't finish the books.

Fast forward to now - we all know how the show ends, and at a high level how the book series will end. I think i'm finally ready to reread what i originally read, and then continue reading until Book 5, then wait impatiently for him to release his last two books.

I'll preface this by saying that I didn't hate the Jaime went back for Cersi. I chalk it up to an addict relapsing.

&amp;#x200B;

So in this version, Jaime still has to sneak in the back way and does so without meeting Hot Topic Euron. Jaime and Cersi still meet up in the Red Keep's Map Room. I love that moment when Cersi'S world is literally crumbing around her and she thinks she's all alone and sees Jaime and we get that little squeak from her. Lena Headly gave GOLD in that scene so I definitely want to keep it. They have their moment and then proceed to weave their way through the crumbling Keep until they make it to access to the boat. More rubble falls and when the dust clears it looks like their way is blocked. But no! There is still some room near the top! They climb and scramble to the opening, dodging more bricks and having to regain ground they lose when the rubble shifts. But they eventually make it. Jaime helps Cersi through the opening then crawls through as more of the Keep collapses, almost pinning him. They see the boat and we get another small squeak from Cersi, this time of a happier shade of disbelief. She smooths her dress and begins walking towards the boat when Hot Topic Euron emerges from behind some tall rocks. He's livid. He's lost his fleet. He's lost his pet Greyjoy prisoner. And he's lost his prince. He confronts Cersi. He knows her baby isn't his. We saw that moment of realization when Tyrion tried to plead her belly to get her to surrender. He runs her through, killing her. Jaime lunges at him and they fight, eventually killing each other. 

Tryion later finds their bodies not under 3 bricks 10 feet away from an empty floor, but only yards away from their escape. Murdered by Cersi's games and insistence on manipulating everyone around her.",6,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

3. Jamie's entire character arc.
4. Bronn becoming master of coin even though he isn't ""clear on the rules"" about basic money lending.
5. Bran's entire character arc.
6. Jon's entire dialogue being reduced to ""she's my queen"" in the last season. So basically, Jon's entire character arc.
7. The Night King's character arc.
8. While we're at it, Dany's entire character arc.
9. Varys' death. I somehow thought the famous spider of westeros would've been a bit smarter than he was. 
10. The Three Eyed Raven being basically useless and absolutely unhelpful until it was time for him to become the king. ""Why did you think I came all this way?"" Like wtf, that's what we want to know. Why would the all knowing, omniscient Three Eyed Raven want to be king? You can't explain that away with some quirky dialogue, wtf.
11. How did Jamie and Euron end up on the same stretch of shore in a huge ass kingdom at the same time?
12. Tyrion not being mentioned in the Song of Ice and Fire (the book written by Sam Tarly). He was only Hand to two rulers, responsible for bringing the last Targaryen to Westeros, responsible for creating an alliance between Dany and the whole entire north so they could defend Westeros from DEAD PEOPLE.
13. The Night King being stupid enough to fall for their stupid plan of using the stupid three eyed raven as bait. 
14. Winterfell's battle plans against the Army of the Dead. They put the catapults in the front of the army. They dug one trench, that only made it harder for them to retreat rather than do anything helpful. What happened to the simple wall defences like throwing barells off the side? They did that when the wildlings were climbing The Wall. 
15. Any and all plot points that could have emerged from Jon aka Aegon Targaryan meeting Dany's dragons. All they did was fly around for a while. 
16. Nymeria.
17. Why weren't the Dothraki armed with dragonglass weapons in the fight against the dead?
18. Drogon somehow understanding that it was the abstract concept of a throne that killed his mother and not the man standing in front of him with a dagger covered in her blood. 
19. The Dothraki who are all sworn blood riders of Dany. In the books, when a khal dies, his bloodriders live long enough only to avenge his death and then follow him to the grave. What happened, they just forgave their Khaleesi's murder?

However, the ending of the GOT show was more appropriate for an episode of the American Constitutional Convention of 1787. Going from a general theme of monarchy/powerful nobles/medieval clothes, weapons, dwellings, etc. to a quasi-republic, with no one in charge who can kick butt and take names, and with hints of democratic votingfor. Me, at least, it just doesnt work.

Now, part of this is because I totally ship Dany (with me, of course) but Ive also studied the Wars Of the Roses and the Middle Ages generally, so I do have some worthwhile background.

First off, Dany is the perfect ruler for a Westeros that has been thoroughly beat up by the warsshe has experience as a ruler, made mistakes as a ruler, but learned from them. And, she is capable of killing people who need killing. Thats how the WOTR ended, with an outsider with only the faintest legitimate to the throne, won a battle at Bosworth, killed the previous king, Richard III, and crowned himself King Henry VII on the battlefield. He kept a very close eye on what was left of the English nobility, and if someone looked or acted like a possible pretender, he had them executed. Between him and his son, Henry VIII, they wiped out almost every noble with a drop of Plantagenet blood, most of them on trumped-up chargesone guy got beheaded because he put the arms of King Edward the Confessor (died 1066) on his shield! Dany on the Iron Throne would have been just as capable of keeping the nobility under control as Henry VII.

Second, I dont think Dany was dangerously crazy. I think she was suffering from what today we would call Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; I think she would have improved after things died down. And any successful Medieval ruler had to be a bit of a son-of-a-bitch, or hed be overthrown (eg., Henry VI was a,very nice guy, but pushed off the throne by his nobles, which started off the WOTR.

Any absolute monarch who went totally crazy could make a terrible mess (eg, Ivan IV Of Russia, dba Ivan the Terrible). To keep Dany under control, or get rid of her if she wound up like her grandfather, there should have been established a Great Council of all the (remaining) nobles, but with representatives of the city dwellers at least, and possibly even the farmersthats how the English Parliament got started. If Dany went totally insane, the Great Council could, by consensus, depose her and replace her.

And for heavens sake, let her marry Jon Snow. European royalty were always marrying close relatives, such as aunt and nephew, uncle and niece, first cousins, etc. Tyrion should take Jon aside and explain to him in words of one syllable and with dagger in hand that his marrying Dany was essential to the peace and security of the realm, and if he didnt like it, that was just too goddamn bad. And if he still wouldnt put out, send him off as Leader of the next expedition to Valeriano, and find somebody else to step up and marry her.

Sorry this is so long, but Ive been wanting to get this off my chest since the show ended. I hope GRRM does a better job than B&amp;W, if he ever finishes the damn thing!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So now I started watching and I would love to listen to a podcast that recaps the episodes and gives some more information/discussion, but without any spoilers for episodes I haven't seen yet.   
I have been listening to the Binge Mode podcasts on Harry Potter and I really like their in-depth discussion of the chapters, but I realised they also give lots of spoilers. That is no problem for harry potter since I have read all books. But I think their Game of thrones podcasts will probably be similar, so I will have to save them until I have finished watching all seasons.   


I have been looking at several lists of 'best podcasts for game of thrones', but haven't been able to find any that just talk about an episode without referencing future episodes.   
Any tips to where I can find something like that? Like maybe a podcast that aired when the first season just came out instead of one where they re-watch the entire show?   


Thanks in advance!",1,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

And btw Im sure this topic has already been talked about before along with these same points, but I wanted to bring it up anyways. 


I was reading a very good comment on YouTube yesterday that said what happens after Oberyn puts the spear in The Mountain is just a GRRM wet dream. He explains that as long as the spear is in Gregor, he could conceivably get up and do what he did, but once the spear was pulled, blood would have gushed out of him, and his circulatory system would have shut down. 

Given this it seems rather preposterous that he would be able to lift all 400 plus pounds of himself off the ground to get aholt of Oberyn after tripping him, which is probably all anyone would have been able to do, especially after poison had been coursing through his body for what seemed like a long time, on top of a direct hit to the heart. 

So according to this scientific/medical theory, what happened wasnt even really possible. Now if you want to say this a fantasy show and you can take creative license with it, fine. But to me this debunks the theory that GOT was truly realistic pre D&amp;D writing it. A more realistic outcome, as a commenter pointed out, would have been for Oberyn to win, Cersei to fly into a rage, and chaos to ensue, maybe Oberyn misses Tywin with a spear, etc. Instead what happened seemed to just be done for shock value and to shoehorn in a vintage GOT moment (kinda like what D&amp;D did with Shireen).

Neds beheading, the Red Wedding, and most of the other memorable deaths were realistic, but this was not compatible with reality it seems to me. 

On a related side note, I get Oberyn had to die sometime. But whether it happened this way or not, he should have gotten more screen time and development than he did (which would have only added to the shock factor if thats what youre going for). Instead he feels a bit like a cheap throwaway plot device for Tyrion, which is only worsened by the well known botching of the Dorne storyline following this. Oberyn is a great character magnificently played by Pedro Pascal, and he deserved better.",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Although, everyone may have a varying opinion on what is key or important to them.

E.g. I see a lot of pictures posted with certain people sitting on the iron throne saying No Spoilers. 

If X character is shown sitting on the throne, and it happens to be a fans favorite character...Wouldnt that be a spoiler? 

Because its essentially saying that this person does not sit on the iron throne in the end. 

Ill tag this as a spoiler so only those who have finished the show will read it - and to prevent anyone currently watching from knowing the post Im talking about.

Martin is the duality in the figure of the knight. While there are characters like Loras Tyrell, who embody the literary archetype, they are, even in the story, a recent invention and an attempt to give prestige to a class that is aleready at the top of society. The knights from the older generation, like the Hound, or commoners who rose to the position, like Bronn, on the other hand emphasize the origins of hte class: a caste of warriors that existed to uphold the structure of society by violent means and were given religious and aristocratic authority to do so.

There are some differences between Martin's knighthood and real world knighthood, and despite these not being minor they do not influence greatly the representation of the dual nature of a group of soldiers who used violence to promote peace, and were glorified as symbol of moral virtue while their primary purpose was to kill members of chosen political opposition.

...

My attempt (did I miss anyone?):

**Tyrion:** Lord Paramont of the Westerlands and Warden of the West.  Tywin turns in his grave. 

**Jon:** King. Turns out to be very good at it, but hates it. Gets to brood a lot.

**Dany**: Tells Westeros to go screw itself, has brief and passionate affair with Yara and then returns to Meeren, where she forges a new empire with Daario at her side (but she quickly finds that actually ruling is really boring and divests power back to people as she always planned)

**Jaime:** Married to Brienne, lots of children

**Cersei:** Dead, killed while sitting on the throne, refusing to yield an inch.

**Arya:** Exploring the unknown with Gendry, later will become lady of Storm's End.

**Brienne:** Establishes Sansa's queensguard, then is released when her father dies to become the Evenstar, married to Jaime.

**Bronn:** Gets the Twins but at the price of an obnoxious Frey wife

**Bran:** Don't really care? Um...adviser to Jon and Sansa. Used most of his powers to guide the final battle and minimise loss of life and slowly becoming a normal, real boy again.

**Davos:** Appointed to small council. Retires to his estates with his wife, maybe adopts the little girl with greyscale scars.

**Jorah:** Died heroically protecting Dany at Winterfell.

**Gendry:** Becomes the extraordinarily under-qualified lord of Storm's End, later marries Arya.

**Missandei and Greyworm:** Living in luxury at Dany's court.

**Sam:** Is discharged from his vows to the Nights Watch. Chooses Gilly over the citadel, inherits Horn Hill, becomes competent and caring lord and writes *Song of Ice and Fire* in his own time.

**Sandor:** Mercy killed his brother, retires someplace warm.

**Sansa:** Queen of the North.

**Theon:** Died protecting the crypts at Winterfell, surrounded by arrow-riddled undead corpses.

**Tormund:** Back with the wildlings, fawned over by wildling women who like him, has many more children.

**Yara:** Having killed Euron becomes Lord Paramont of the Iron Islands.",7,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just recently got out of the military and got my parents to start watching.

They were hesitant at first, because they've heard from their co-workers about all the rape and violence. When it comes to the violence, they're fine. However the rape scenes are what they have specifically said they don't want to see.

I googled 'GoT scenes to skip.'

One of the top results was a Reddit post where the poster was a rape victim. The comments were full of supportive texts and lists of scenes in the show (complete with episode and times) that were rape scenes to skip.

Another of the top posts was another Reddit post where the poster never claimed to be a victim. They only wanted to skip the rape scenes. Replies to that thread were along the lines of ""rape is bad but incest and excessive gore is okay?' or 'well this isn't the show for you.'

I suppose my question is why must someone be a victim of rape for this community to want to help them.

Rape is a terrible thing that happens all the time.

It happens to our friends, our family.

Is it truly terrible to want to skip these scenes even though we've never been a victim?

These television characters... We feel for them. We sympathize and we try to understand their minds. They're like real people.

Why is it that I would have to be a victim to be given the kindness of these strangers? 

Rape is not something that anyone should WANT to see. If someone's expresses a desire to not see these scenes, why must they be a rape victim to receive the support of the community?

I know people who have been raped. When I see these scenes, I think of them. Every time. 

I suppose I just don't understand why we seemingly can't express distaste over horrible things that we've never had to go through.

In my opinion, if someone doesn't want to see a rape, they shouldn't have to.

But when people come together in force and say things like ""You're ok with .....prolonged physical and mental torture, but the sex scenes are where you draw the line?"" ... 

It just doesn't seem right to me.

Im not writing here today to blast these people. Rather, I am looking to discuss why a non-victim's discomfort with rape is insignificant to this community's eyes.",13,1,False,self,,,,,

It wasn't hard to find unresolved questions for every character.

Daenerys - Will she finally sit on the Iron Throne? Is she pregnant? Will she and Jon have a happy ending despite the odds?

Jon - Will he kill the Night King? Will he and Dany share the throne?

Jaime - How much can his evolution go on? Is he really over Cersei?

Cersei - How will she die? How much trouble she is going to cause before she dies?

Arya - How will her abilities play a role in the final season? (I always suspected she wouldn't kill Cersei)

Sansa - Will she finally be able to control the North on her own when the series ends since Jon most likely will be somewhere else?

The same thing could be said for other characters like Sandor with the Cleganebowl coming and Theon or Jorah who I expected to die heroically.

 The point is everyone of these characters had unresolved business going into season 8 except for Tyrion. And I think this is such a shame because in many ways the evolution of Tyrion is not highlighted enough past season 5, not because it isn't there, but because there is not much emphasis on how his character changed. He does not pop up in the other characters' conversations as much as he talks about others. Just try to compare how much he was mentioned in Season 4. You can perceive how much his character changed thanks to Peter and his acting but imagine how different it would have been if they had kept his father, his nemesis, alive till the last season, or if they had introduced Tysha back in his life. Narrowing Tyrion's story down to being the Hand, a position he has held for many seasons, so not exactly a goal to reach, without his personal story and the last statement about his character being ""he made many terrible mistakes and he's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them"", when every other character made mistakes actually, is a great disservice to his character. I think D&amp;D and GRRM both struggled with writing Tyrion's story post Tywin's and Shae's deaths, but still many fans will still think his character was better in the first three books and the first four seasons. I still consider him the best character the show created for his complexity, but had they highlighted this aspect more, I think many would have been happier.",12,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Most of the criticism is completely justified. However, there is one key argument a lot of people make which is poorly thought out and it's become more so just a ""GOT is trash!"" talking point of hate in order to receive reactions. 

What I'm referring to is the complaint people have about Tyrion claiming Bran should be King because Bran had the best story. People will say Jon had the best story, Dany had the best story, Arya, Jamie, or literally anyone other than Bran had a better story. I agree with all of that, but I think people are missing the big picture of what Tyrion is actually saying. 

Tyrion isn't saying Bran's personal story is the best story. Tyrion is saying Bran had the best story because he knows **everyone's** story. Bran is the 3 eyed raven, and so he knows **the** story. Bran knows the entire story of Game of Thrones. He knows front to back, what has happened, what is happening, and what will happen, and he knows it all in total truth. This is why Tyrion suggests Bran be King, and it makes a lot more sense. 

I personally feel like Jon should have been King with Bran as his hand, but nonetheless, Tyrion's point was much greater than people give credit for in my opinion. Anyways end of my rant. Let me know your thoughts!",31,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

It has also exacerbated my depression regarding the prequel series. 

Take Better Call Saul, for example, despite knowing where it ends, it ends on such a great note that you WANT to see how we got there. 

However, knowing how GoT ends? The Night King and all the lore, mystery, contradictions and unanswered questions ends with Arya flying out of nowhere with a dagger?

The prince/princess who was promised? Just bullshit? 

What about all the red priestesses and their roles.

The Lord Of Light? 

Its just disgustingly disappointing. So much so that I just am NOT excited to see how we got there. S8 has officially sold me on never supporting anything D&amp;D does again. Despite the original 4 seasons (5-7 has some decent moments but its inconsistent after 4.)

Ill probably watch it, but I hope that somehow the original shows ending gets retconned. Like I dont care how they do it. Its just. Trash.",16,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well, the obvious answer seems to be that he's just arrogant. Why should he be afraid of this little girl? A dragon couldn't kill him. Let her walk up, let her try to stab him with her glass butter knife. It probably won't even do anything.

The fact that he never runs reinforces my belief that he takes winning for granted.

The final Game of Thrones season, which has arguably also been the most controversial one. Here's my honest opinion about it. 

Episode 1:

As it was expected, the first episode would mainly feature reunions, and battle plans. Nothing's been to extraordinary in that episode, but nothing too bad either. Just a normal Game of Thrones start/mid season episode, where there's casual battle plans, and also some heartfelt reunions, such as Jon's and Arya's (though I did have a more intense feeling of true love on Jon's reunion with Sansa rather than Arya, felt more emotional). Anyways, Jon got to ride a dragon, cool and all. The first's episode has just been an all around chill episode which I didn't really care much about, and I don't think I could've asked for something better from a season premiere. The scene where Jon found out the truth could've been carried more in depth by Sam, but it wasn't disappointing for what it was supposed to be. Tyrion's / Varys's jokes at the beginning felt a bit stupid and childish though.

Episode 2 (Personal favorite from the season):

This episode's really been a showstopper, for me at least. Starts off with Jaime's trial, which I felt was pretty intense, as Jaime was somewhere lowkey nervous standing in front of the person he had crippled for life. A weird exchange of looks between him, Sansa and Bran, which seemed a bit too extra for me, but I didn't mind it. I loved Nikolaj's acting in the scene, he really executed it beautifully, especially when he honored his pledge to battle against the dead in front of Jon &amp; Daenerys. Moving on, there were some interesting exchange of talks between Jaime/Tyrion, Jaime/Brienne, which were mainly episode fillers. Also, the Arya/Gendry sex scene seemed totally predictable to me, but I didn't have a single problem with it like some people had. Anyways, moving onto my favorite scene of the season: Brienne's knighting. The scene was a true masterpiece, Gwen's acting was phenomenal. She had finally fullfilled her life-long purpose of becoming a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Episode ends with Jon's and Dany's scene in the crypts, with the truth being revealed to her, which started the slight distance between those 2, which had become severe in the final episodes. Episode ends with White Walkers arriving at Winterfell.

Episode 3:

Episode starts with 10 minutes of consistent battle prep, which was obviously just a filler. The lighting was far off, as literally the only thing that helped see through was Melisandre's fire. Anyways, a whole Dothraki army flies off and's never to be seen again. But then, magically, the army doubles 2 episodes later (Episode 5 talk). Anyways, some side characters die at the beginning, which were very predictable, such as Edd, Lyanna and Beric. Bran's guarded at Godswood by Theon and some soldiers, and finally Theon finishes his arc by protecting Bran to the very end, following him being impaled by the NK. Theon's death seemed good to me, it seemed like an arc completion. The only thing weird about it was the way he rushed to the Night King, thinking he could stop it all. Anyways, as the NK was approaching Bran, I have absolutely no idea why the hell he kept staring at him for 10 minutes, and then finally slowly pulling his sword from the back, when out of nowhere, Arya appears and ends him in no time. All the build-up, 8 seasons, gone in a single episode, through a stab in the abdomen. That scene was way too rushed, and it didn't even make sense for a lot of fans, especially for me. NK's death, in my opinion, should've been a 5-10 minutes fight with Jon. Jon's the champion of Ice and Fire, and at least his lineage would've been into proper use then, as the champion of Ice and Fire would put an end to the winter. It wasn't ""predictable"" that Jon should've killed the Night King and bla bla bla, it was just how it was supposed to happen. Instead Jon was just screaming at a dragon for 2-3 minutes straight... The best scene in the episode to me was Jorah's death. Man succesfully died doing what he loved, protecting his beloved Khaleesi. Hats off to Jorah, a true knight, had a memorable death. Episode ends with Melisandre's death (honestly would've wanted Davos to kill her). 

Episode 4:

Now that they were done with the dead, they moved on to Daenerys's big plan of taking the IT from Cersei. Daenerys obviously had enough and more of the power needed to conquer the capital, but her overconfidence cost her in the loss of one of her dragons, Rhaegal. It was predictable that by the end she'd remain only with Drogon, exactly after her first dragon, Viserion, died. The Iron Fleet had a surprise attack on her on DragonStone, and therefore, rip little dragon. Jon's decided to share his lineage with Sansa and Arya, asking them to swear an oath that they would never pass it on to someone else. Arya kept her oath, but Sansa at the first moment, told it to Tyrion. Sansa's never been my favorite, but that scene was a bit out of character for her. I know she was arguably one of, if not the best player of the game, but that scene still made her look like a total snitch. Anyways, Tyrion immedieately told Varys, and Varys, as he was always looking to seek for the best ruler, he wanted to clarify that the throne should've gone to Jon to the whole Westeros. (Personal opinion: If I had to choose solely from one of Daenerys or Jon, I'd go for Jon. Jon's a lot more down to earth, and although very inexperienced, with a bit of help from Tyrion he would've done excellent. So I agreed with Varys here.) Anyways, Daenerys's very upset about losing her dragon, but then comes the big shock of the episode. A disgusting and completely unnecessary scene. Missandei's beheading. Poor girl had no reason to die, she was just one of Dany's most loyal advisors, died in a horrendous way, beheaded by a living zombie. I don't think everyone here liked that scene, arguably the worse scene of Season 8 in my opinion. Literally no reason for it, other than just to build up the rushed descension to madness of Daenerys. 

Episode 5:

Episode begins with a depressed looking Dany looking out in vain. She's suffered way too much, and I agree she'd have a good reason to lose it, but not in the way it happened, just a few minutes into the episode. She was ready to charge against the throne, and ready to take it away from Cersei. Tyrion knew that she wasn't well psychologically, and begged her to stop the attack if the bells ring, which means they surrendered. Of course, that didn't happen. The bells have just driven the poor girl completely mad, and then she started burning down a whole city. Daenerys has never been one of my favorites, but she hasn't been in the bottom either. She had a goal, and she did everything to get to it. Big respect to her for that. But she's gained too much overconfidence, which would result eventually in a delusion, therefore a built-up descension to madness. Throughout the show, there have been hints of her having true Targaryen blood, such as when burning people alive, good or evil. But her mad turn was way too rushed, they could've easily done another 2-3 seasons, where she took the iron throne, and eventually becoming mad after a few years of ruling, instead of going mad in 2 episodes. There was plenty of time to do all thing perfect. Anyways, also another thing that bothered me the most in the episode. When Jaime spoke to Tyrion, he said he'd never cared about innocent people. How tf is that true? He's literally saved 500k people from the hands of the Mad King, saved Brienne from the bear pit, and took Riverrun without loss of life. He did care about people. Allthough he didn't really have the smartest brain around, he definetly had some of the biggest hearts. That scene, which was supposed to be his defining scene, was completely shit. To me, a total disrespect to his true character. His arc ends with him and Cersei dying together in the Red Keep's crypts, which had me disappointed, because it was not the way his arc should've been completed. He should've had a heroic death, after killing his sister, fullfilling an oath to the good. I would've loved him to survive, but there was just no way that could've happened, so at least I wanted him to die a memorable death. That didn't happen either, bollocks. The only scene I liked in the episode was Cleganebowl, although the Hound had no reason to die. They could've just made him kill the mountain, with him being lifely wounded, but at least managing to carry on a good life somewhere in a Westerosi village, which was his lifelong goal, except for killing his brother. Just to be by himself, with no stress around him.

Season finale:

A completely shocked Tyrion walks around the King's Landing ruins, seeing bodies burnt down to ashes, buildings destroyed, him being followed by Jon and Davos in the back. Then Jon captures Grey Worm (the robot) killing Lannister soldiers, and tells him to stop it as they're already harmless, but GW ignores him. Anyways, Daenerys makes her speech to everyone, saying how she'd freed the whole world from the hands of a tyrant, while she has unfortunately become one herself. She's completely lost it, and then Tyrion resigns as her hand, which led to him being imprisoned. He has a 10 minute talk with Jon, telling him that she must be stopped, before she continues on destroying other parts of the world. The whole talk felt so boring to me, as almost everyone knew by that point everything fell down on Jon's back to carry out. Jon, mesmerized by the situation, has a final emotional talk with Dany, before killing her. I cannot say I have been nor too happy, and nor too sad about the scene. I haven't been too happy because they were both sharing and amazing love story together, and that Jon did not feel good at all about doing it, but he was forced to, but the Westeros mastermind. I didn't feel too sad either, because I knew Daenerys wouldn't have a happy end. It was just supposed to be another 3-4 seasons before her story came to an end, a good built-up descension to evil for her, as other show protagonists have had before, still remaining fan favorites. This was just rushed, and dull. Furthermore, Jon is sent to the NW for preventing conflicts with Grey Worm after doing the shocking deed. Personally, I would've loved to have seen a trial by combat between Jon and Grey Worm, with Jon killing him, and then deciding what to do with his life. It was clear that Jon didn't want under any circumstance the IT, although I would've loved him to have taken it due to his lineage, and the shit he has been through, man was brought back to life, and it all seemed like it was for nothing. Tyrion's carried out to the council to have his fate decided, yet he single-handedly decides who should be the next king. In my personal view, if Jon was really excluded, the throne should've gone to Gendry, as he was an heir too, and a ruler that wouldn't disappoint the Westerosi people. Overall a really calm and down to earth guy. Instead, they go for Bran, who didn't really need it. He was just the 3ER, predicting the good and bad of the continent. He had an impressive run, but his story was arguably equal or slightly more dull than Jon's, Sansa's or Arya's, for example. Definetly more dull than Jon's, who had the best story imo. They could've just continued the bloodline with Gendry, as it can be guaranteed that nothing bad would've happened with him. Anyways, series finale ends, showing who really won the game. The Stark family. My favorite house, it was pretty predictable they'd come out on top at the end. But the finale really was emotional, and the parallels between the scenes was phenomenal, showcasing everyone having achieved their purpose. Sansa becoming QITN, by playing the game brilliantly. Arya becoming an adventurer, and Jon wandering off beyond the north, where he always wanted to be. Yes, for some fans, including myself, the finale was hard to digest. But if you look it in the way of the character's callings, their purpose has been achieved, resulting in the sweet part of the bittersweet ending. The bitter part mainly being the deaths of Daenerys and Jaime. The sweet part being Arya, Jon and Sansa having achieved their purpose, and the unnecessary part being Bran becoming the king.   


Conclusion:

All in all, the ending does link up to the show's story. It's just that some scenes, such as Jaime's talk to Tyrion, or Missandei's beheading, were completely off. One had no tie to the character's storyline, and the other was just not needed. Also, Dany's madness descension was rushed, in a way that it was just not good. But, there were some exceptional scenes, such as Brienne's knighting, Jorah's death, and the finale scene, where the 3 siblings have achieved their life long dream. Nobility, adventurousness, and freedom. I can say that it's definetly not a disasterous season, but also not an exceptional one. My rating would be a solid 7.5/10 for it, opinions are very much appreciated, and I do not want any unnecessary fights or drama to happen in the comments. Just constructive criticism, and fair opinions, that are worth debating. Thanks for taking your time into reading my sole opinion of the season, looking forward into hearing yours.

Right from the very begining, Martin draws you in with intrigue and mystery in the first few pages. Very few authors manage to really draw you into a scene/book within those pages, but Martin does it incredibly. He does well to set the atomsphere of a scene and the way in which he describes the world, its surroundings and the characters who inhabit it, make for serious and compelling reading.

**Atmosphere:**

In a book series such as this, atmosphere is everything and Martin knows how to create it. For example, in the scene after King Roberts death, where Ned confronts Cersei and the newly crowned King Jeoffry; as a reader, you can feel the tension in the scene and it becomes more and more palpabale with each line. The build up until Littlefingers betrayal is so wonderfully written and is one of the best (and most heartbreaking) twists in the entire book. ~~(Fuck you Littlefinger you bearded cock, I was rooting for you)~~ 

Another great moment is the reveal that Maester Aemon is a Targaryen. Like most twists, you never expect them; but that one came really out of left field. The scene leading up to in which Aemon tells Jon that he must deside where his true loyalties must lie is one of the best scenes in the novel and a great character scene for Jon.

**The world of ASOIAF:** 

Each region, each location of the world never feels tacked on. They always serve some level of purpose. Be it a small tavern on the Kingsroad to a Sept and Godswood within a Kingdoms castle, each place plays the role of a cog in a much larger engine that is the story of A Game of Thrones.

As for how the world is written; again Martin does that spectacularly. You feel the chill in the air of Winterfell, or the sweltering heats of Vaes Dothrak. The freezing winds of the Wall, and dizzying heights of the Eyrie. Whilst obviously not real, you, as the reader, feel as if they are (I know this is a basic of good writing but he is bloody good at it). Each region/Kingdom feels well lived in and when characters go to places within the areas such as the crypts of Winterfell or beyond the wall, you can feel the history of those places seeping through the pages which is a testiment to how good of a writer and a worldbuilder Martin truely is.

**Characters:**

A Game of Thrones is nothing, if not full to the brim with characters. Whilst it does have its avangtages, such as making the world feel more lived in, it does have its downsides. For example I became confused during the scene where Dany attempted to use the magic of Mirri Maz Duur to help Drogo come back to full health, the fight outside the tent became difficult to follow when you forget who are Drogos bloodriders and who are Danysbodygaurds.

However there are some superbly written character and others who I would like to see where their character goes from here. The main players in the story like Ned and Catelyn, Cersei, Jon, Dany, Tyrion are some of the best written characters in the whole novel. I would like to see where Ayras story goes following on from Neds execution (can we get an F in the chat for Eddard?), how Sansa treats her betrothal to King Jeoffry (the little shitgobblin), more of Jorahs backstory, and how Robb will be treated as King of the North.

**Conclusion:**

As an introduction into the seriesA Song of Ice and Fire,A Game of Thrones is an excellent first novel. From the writing to the dialouge and to the characters; this is a book that will have you laughing at something that King Robert has said such as I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I can eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave to gasping in shock at the Littlefingers betrayal of Ned. George R.R. Martin has sealed his legacy as a superb writer in just one book. That isnt to say that there are scenes/moments that arent great and those that leave me feeling rather uncomfortable. But by and large, it is a great book with great characters and some truly amazing moments. So now I move onto book two, and see if winter, is truly coming.

Favourite Characters:

* Ned Stark (R.I.P)

Yes, it had some poor military decisions and contrivances but overall I thought the episode did an excellent job of building dread, creating a horrifying/tense atmosphere, and with some excellent choreography/shots. My main issue is that the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. At first I thought it was just because of the bad execution but as I think about it more I realize that Arya shouldn't have killed the Night King (but not for the reason you think). I think with a better ending the episode would've been nearly a masterpiece. People nitpick and notice plot holes when there are larger issues at play and this is by far the biggest issue. Part 1 provides a thematic exploration of the dead and explores how GOT/ASOIAF has deconstructed the hero's journey, specifically the chosen one narrative. Part 2 will build off of part 1 to provide a more satisfying conclusion to the story of the dead. It's extremely long and there will be a TL;DR at the bottom of part 2.

**The Others:** The Others, as they are called in the book, are a dark mirror to humanity. They embody all of Westeros's most violent tendencies. They are mindless, all powerful and evil. They want to conquer everything. They are the personification or the cost of the game of thrones.

The Night King, just like many of the human Kings we've seen wants to add everyone to his Kingdom. He seeks to conquer the living to add them to his kingdom of death. The Wight's/White Walkers are mindless supporters of their King. Fanatics who are blindly devoted to their master after being beaten into submission. They are the perfect subject for tyrants. They are like Euron's mutes, or what Joffrey, Cersei, and Ramsey want from their subjects, blind loyalty.

**The Night King's Motivation:** In 8x02, Bran makes it clear that the Night King wants him since he is the world's memory. Not bad but can be slightly improved. Both Bran and the Night King are essentially deities with the Night King a malevolent force and Bran a passive observer. The Night King sees Bran as the biggest threat to his reign. The only entity with enough power to stop him. Naturally, he wants to conquer that threat.

**Symbols:** Additionally, Bran is also the only one who knows the truth about the Night King. Much of Game of Thrones revolves around symbols and perception. Jaime is known as the Kingslayer, we have Aegon the Conqueror, and the Mad King. Much of the story shows the dangerous side of symbols. We learn that the Kingslayer isn't who Jaime is, people are more than their symbols but they embrace them to spread fear and mistrust. The Night King actively embraces his symbol as the all-powerful and evil tyrant. Bran knows his origin as a man who was tragically turned into a weapon. With Bran out of the way, the Night King can truly become his symbol.

**Bran Isn't the Night King:** I've seen many suggestions that Bran should've been the Night King or some other twist that makes him sympathetic. Most of those are unnecessarily convoluted on a plot level and don't add much to the story. There are already so many excellent sympathetic but evil(ish) characters . For the Night King to stand out, he should be a malevolent deity.

**Deconstructing the Genre**: Many of GOT/ASOIAF's best moments comes from how it deconstructs tropes of the fantasy genre and the hero's journey. In Lord of the Rings, Sauron is just evil and I have set up the Night King to be similar. GRRM wanted to challenge LOTR so why is the Night King released? At the time LOTR was released, the trend was to create villains that were plain evil but now the trend is more sympathetic villains (Thanos) so I think cycling back to the LOTR approach is actually appropriate here to deconstruct what is recent in the genre. More importantly, as mentioned before I think this allows the Night King to stand out more and more effectively act as a mirror.

**The Chosen One**: Most stories have a chosen one going through the hero's journey to defeat the bad guy. This is most often seen as that chosen ones goes through a hero's journey (Joseph Campbell) to complete their arc. As such, to remain true to the story GOT has been telling I think the Night King has to be defeated by someone who isn't a chosen one or where killing him neatly completes their arc. Jon Snow is the most obvious candidate that fits this chosen one narrative which is why he shouldn't kill the Night King. I loved their staredown in this episode. He is the exiled but true king, a morally good man who has dedicated his life to facing this evil. He cannot defeat the Night King.

**Arya**: Before 8x03 ended if you were to ask me the likeliest endings to the episode, Jon killing the Night King would've been first but Arya killing him would've been second. Execution aside, Arya killing the Night King makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Her whole arc has been consumed by death. Her training with Syrio Forel (what do we say...), the brotherhood (Beric's ressurection, Melisandre's prophecy), her travels with the morbid hound, her training with the faceless men are all about her interacting with death as she is consumed by her obsession with vengeance or her obsession with death. Killing the Night King, the embodiment of death, is a fitting end to her arc as she overcomes death.

In addition, the faceless men are a cult that literally worships death. Arya is trained to become a supernatural assassin by death. She has extra powers, hallmarks of a chosen one. So she can't kill the Night King. I would've had that moment play out basically the same but better executed. Arya sneaks up on the Night King with her skills but he overcomes her and kills her. Its a shitty end to her story, just like Ned and Robb got. She tragically fails to overcome death, her lust for vengeance, her trauma as she doesn't fulfill her destiny as the chosen one.

**Dany**: Dany is literally invulnerable to fire. She also gave birth to three dragons, not seen in a while. She is declared Azor Ahai by the red priestess. She is also the forgotten but true Queen. A chosen one. I loved her moment with the Night King. She has burned so many men like that before but not the Night King. Here we see her tyrannical reflection. They are both magical monarchs with unhealthy egos that think they are breaking the wheel. Dany by freeing the proletariat masses and the Night King by breaking the wheel of life. Here we see Dany brought down a she realizes she is not all powerful. It makes her succumbing to her tyrannical impulses later even more tragic (note: if you don't like Dany's fall I'm not saying it fixes it on a character level).

**Bran**: As mentioned above, Bran is the Night King's biggest threat (supposedly). The boy who got crippled but learned to fly. He became a time traveling deity with immense powers. Both he and the Night King are ancient deities who remember the history of the world. Bran is a more passive sense and the Night King in a more vengeful sense. Bran takes his shot at the Night King and fails. I don't know how this attempt plays out but then again who knows anything with Bran.

**Screw Azor Ahai**: GOT is pretty critical of religion throughout its run. Azor Ahai is prophesied by the red priestess to rise up and defeat the night king. Azor Ahai is just the chosen one. To me having an Azor Ahai (which I think Arya essentially is) is a mistake as it validates all of the negative things done by religious fanatics. I'm not saying it removes the nuance from the religious elements but it does hint that the ends justify the means. In my version, the Night King defeats all the Azor Ahai's, he defeats the Gods of the living, proving his power and making all of Melisandre's actions for naught.",15,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

I mean, yes the first seasons had the books to go on and George is still working on the last parts of the whole book series, but did the writers write a whole other ending than what George has planned for the story and books? If I was George, I think Id be pretty unhappy if the show would reveal the ending of a story that I had been working on for over 20 years, just like that, taking away all the shock and surprise and amazement from reading the ending. Im no author and have never worked on something like this, but thats what I can imagine what it must feel like for George. 

What do you all think, was the shows end written in consideration of Georges hard work, or were the writers really as lazy as everyone says they were? (note: I havent read any comments from George or D&amp;D about the shows ending if there are any from them, and if this theory has already been asked about here before, I apologize for unknowingly copying it)",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, there were definitely things I would have liked to see differently. So for fun, I decided to make a fan-fiction version of some of the plot elements from the second half of Game of Thrones Season 8 in the form of Telltale game style choices. Similar to the official telltale game that focuses on House Forrester, I will make a handful of characters the playable character. Some things will be the same, others will be different, and some scenes will be left out. This is strictly something I came up with for fun, and is not a statement on how I think the show should have ended. Here is the second half of the final season of Game of Thrones in the style of a telltale game.

1. Jaime leaves Winterfell (Playable Character: Jaime): After Jaime hears about Rhaegal being killed by the Iron Fleet, he prepares to leave Winterfell to go to Kings Landing, but is stopped by Brienne who begs him to stay. Jaime has the option of staying with Brienne or going to Kings Landing. If Jaime stays, he will remain in Winterfell for the remainder of the series, with him being named Lord of Casterly Rock at the end. If he leaves, he will be captured by the Targaryen forces on his way into the city, and gets secretly released by Tyrion.

2. Tell Daenerys about Varys plan (Playable Character: Tyrion): When taking to Daenerys, Tyrion has the option of telling her about Varys plan to have her killed. If Tyrion tells Daenerys, Varys is burned alive and Daenerys goes to Kings Landing. If Tyrion does not tell Daenerys, she drinks a glass of wine containing poison, and dies. With the Unsullied and Dothraki leaderless, Varys urges Jon to step up and lead the attack of Kings Landing. Jon reluctantly agrees, and reveals his secret to Grey Worm, who makes him promise that he wont spare Cersei.

3. Daenerys burns Kings Landing (Playable Character: Daenerys): Daenerys has won the battle and hears the bells of surrender. She can either accept the surrender of the Lannister army or burn Kings Landing. If she accepts the surrender, Cersei will refuse to back down and orders Qyburn to set off all the traps of Wildfire under the city, and Burn then all. The members of the Queensguard make haste to the locations with Wildfire and ignite them, killing many civilians and soldiers on Daenerys side, but also setting off a chain reaction that makes its way to where Cersei and the Mountain are. Daenerys wins without killing any innocent people herself, but at the cost of much of her army. If Daenerys burns Kings Landing, the events will unfold like in the show. 

4. Aryas Revenge (Playable Character: Arya): Arya and the Hound notice the destruction of the city either caused by Daenerys or Cersei. The Hound attempts to convince Arya to leave and save herself. Arya has the option of listening to The Hound or refusing to listen to his advice and continue her quest for vengeance against Cersei. If she listens to The Hound, her story in the episode will play out the same way. If she refuses, the Hound will reluctantly allow her to join him, and the two make their way to Cersei and the Mountain. The Hound meets his fate regardless both choices. When Cersei walks down the steps, she finds Arya waiting for her. Arya runs up to her and sticks Needle through her heart. Cersei falls to the ground and dies. However, Arya is crushed and killed by the collapse of the building. 

5. Jaime and Cersei (Playable Character: Jaime): Jaime has just killed Euron Greyjoy and found Cersei. Jaime has the option to kill Cersei or lead her to safety. If Jaime chooses to lead Cersei to safety, he will die with her under the rubble just like in the show. If Jaime decides to kill Cersei, he will pull out his sword only for her to flee. Jaime will be forced to chase after her through the underground parts of the city. He will struggle due to the wound he received from Euron. Jaime eventually catches up to Cersei and plunges his sword through her back just like he did to the Mad King. He notices that the ceiling of the room is collapsing and accepts his fate. If Jaime stayed in Winterfell or if Arya listened to The Hound, Cersei will die by herself under the collapsing debris. If Jaime went to Kings Landing and Arya refused to listen to The Hound, he only finds Cerseis corpse.

6. Jon Snows Choice (Playable Character: Jon): If Daenerys burned the city, she will have Tyrion arrested, who begs Jon to kill Daenerys for the good of the realm. Jon can either kill Daenerys or join her. If he kills Daenerys, the ending of the show will be exactly the same. If he joins Daenerys, she will remain as the queen and have Tyrion executed. Jon will beg Sansa to let her have the North and she begrudgingly agrees. Daenerys asks Jon to marry her, and Jon accepts his new role, but is extremely uncertain about the future. If Daenerys did not burn the city, Tyrion will not be arrested and remain loyal to her, while she becomes queen of the six kingdoms as she promised Yara independence for the Iron Islands. If Tyrion did not tell Daenerys about Varys plan and lets her die, Jon will take the throne and become king of the six kingdoms, allowing the North the be independent. Tyrion will be his Hand of the King, Davos the Master of Ships, Varys the Master of Whisperers, Bronn the Master of Coin, Sam the Grand Maester, and Brienne the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, regardless of if Jaime stays at Winterfell. If Arya listened to the Hound, she will still set sail for West of Westeros.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Jon can either kill Daenerys or join her. If he kills Daenerys, the ending of the show will be exactly the same. If he joins Daenerys, she will remain as the queen and have Tyrion executed. Jon will beg Sansa to let her have the North and she begrudgingly agrees. Daenerys asks Jon to marry her, and Jon accepts his new role, but is extremely uncertain about the future. If Daenerys did not burn the city, Tyrion will not be arrested and remain loyal to her, while she becomes queen of the six kingdoms as she promised Yara independence for the Iron Islands. If Tyrion did not tell Daenerys about Varys plan and lets her die, Jon will take the throne and become king of the six kingdoms, allowing the North the be independent. Tyrion will be his Hand of the King, Davos the Master of Ships, Varys the Master of Whisperers, Bronn the Master of Coin, Sam the Grand Maester, and Brienne the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, regardless of if Jaime stays at Winterfell. If Arya listened to the Hound, she will still set sail for West of Westeros.",3,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

He never wanted to be king. He has always been the underdog fighting for those who needed his help the most. He never wanted power, only peace and what better way than to spend the rest of your days in the company of people who care not what you are, but who you are.
His royal blood never mattered in the grand scheme of things because it was only meant to show that he was an amazing person because of the people in his life, not because he had a grand destiny. His name is basically means John Doe. He was an Everyman whos whole life built up to one defining gap moment, and when it was over he was stripped of all the power he had accumulated and sent back right where he started almost as if it was all a dream.

Now after everything Jon is very much like a combination of Aemon and Jaime. A man of a legendary bloodline who refused a greater destiny and an oath-breaker hated by many but loved by those who matter.

I have to get this off my chest, I've been a fan of the series since 2016 and i watched the whole show

like 4 times by now, (except season 7 and 8) , im learning this awesome piano piece from season 6 called Light of the

Seventh, if you dont know it go on youtube and listen to it now, and i just started to think about my experience with this

amazing show and how tragic it was for me to watch season 7\~8, and i kept hoping everything will make sense until the

very end of it.

I remember back in high school my friends convinced me to watch it and i

got to season 2 to the episode with craster, it was the first time i believe we saw the night king and he

turned one of Craster's babies into a white walker and i could not help but scream, all i wanted is to see who is the night

king and what's his origin i trusted the show to give me answers.

they kept building all these super complicated story lines with

jon's real identity and the white walkers and the lord of light and it still hurts me so bad that it all meant nothing in the

end, remember Tywin? some people say the series went to shit only because he died and i gotta say its a little shaky

but can we all agree that he was the most badass character ever seen on tv?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just expected more than a surprising death for his character.

Also Brans storyline? What was the point of Brans abilities? Correct me if I an wrong, but I cannot recall when they contributed significantly to the story? 

What also bothered me in a few seasons was the lazy method of using rape to invoke horror. I cant remember exactly which seasons that were but there was a time when the storys only fear-invoking strategy was to use rape. I am thinking of Sansa being raped by Ramsey anf Brienne almost being raped as well. 

For me the first few seaons had so may build-ups, that the last season either completely ignored or solved in a rushed manner. The best example for that was of course the Night King battle. Seven seasons of saying the game of thrones doesnt matter if the dead win and then just have it solved in one episode.

So although D&amp;D should have just stood their ground, made GOT their main priority and continued it the way that they originally wanted, money hungry Disney really should have been more respectful and let D&amp;D take as long as they needed.

So although D&amp;D should have just stood their ground, made GOT their main priority and continued it the way that they originally wanted, money hungry Disney really should have been more respectful and let D&amp;D take as long as they needed.

\- According to my source these discussions actually started in 2015, and before the discussions D&amp;D were planning for Game of Thrones to finish with a 9th season which would have aired in 2021 (10 years after season 1). But this would not have given them enough time to make their Star Wars movie which Disney really wanted for the 2022 release date.",13,0,False,self,,,,,
924,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-9-16,2019,9,16,0,d4lr8f,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Dany and Sansa's Season 8 Antagonism made Sense.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d4lr8f/spoilers_dany_and_sansas_season_8_antagonism_made/,HouseHightower,1568560608,"Rushed, yes, but I thought the story beats of the final season made perfect sense, in terms of Dany and Sansa.

They were destined to hate each other. For Dany to get what she wants, Sansa has to meekly go back to ""Yes your grace"" ""Of course your grace"" ""Thank you your grace"". That's LITERALLY how she spent the first 3+ seasons.

When Sansa married Ramsay, the alliance between The Iron Throne/The Lannisters and The North/The Boltons, was publicly shattered. From that point forward, the Iron Throne had no say over the succession of The North. That was the entire reason she was married to Ramsay. Only now, after enduring all of that, the North is given to Daenerys Targaryen?? Daenerys controls who inherits what in the North. Daenerys controls where the North's armies go (as evidenced when Sansa was told to shut up about the men resting after TLN), IF inclined Daenerys could have Sansa married to Lord XYZ. After everything it took to get back to Winterfell and hold it, of course LOOKING at Daenerys is going to make Sansa spit nails.

Sansa could also see the sway Tyrion Lannister had on Daenerys. She saw Tyrion as a good man but she also knows today's friends can be tomorrow's sworn enemies. If something is devastating for Sansa/The Starks but good for whatever team Tyrion supports (House Lannisters control of the Throne for the first 3 seasons as an example) he'll do it. Tyrion's counsel of Daenerys led to the fall/death of Olenna Tyrell, Ellaria Sand and her Sand Snakes. Their fate was written by Tyrion Lannister?!?!?

Jon was not able to influence Daenerys. It was very much the other way around, at least on political matters. Does anyone think Daenerys would not have gotten Jon to sign off on various ideas (that benefit her to House Stark 80/20)? As long as she left Sansa alive, I don't think Jon would have said a word against Daenery's plans (marrying Sansa to some random in Highgarden, The Reach or someone she considers loyal, using Northern Land to bribe particular Lords, etc). Look at the strategy meeting and how Jon immediately ""Yes Man's"" Daenaerys, the ONLY time Sansa has an idea that is productive for everyone (letting the soldiers rest), as opposed to her own goal of Northern Independence.

To say nothing of the fact that Sansa is no stranger to Family trying to murder her in the name of love. Not too long ago Lyssa Arryn was trying to give her first hand experience, plunging through the Vale's infamous moon door.

On top of all this, Sansa knows Alliances/Marriages are just power struggles without the swords.

House Baratheon/ House Lannisters - were allies and that resulted in the subjugation and extermination of House Baratheon.

House Lannister/ House Tyrell - were allies and that was a non-stop power struggle beginning with the Tyrells scheming to marry Sansa to their heir and gain control of the North from right under the Lannisters. To say nothing of murdering the King (they didn't have to get involved with the WOT5K but they did because they wanted to control the Iron Throne).

House Stark/House Bolton/House Frey - were allies, need I articulate how that went.

House Tyrell/House Stark - Sansa confided the truth to Margaery and Olenna, they both presented themselves as someone Sansa could trust. But when convenient/if necessary, they intended for Sansa to take the fall for regicide. Littlefinger made sure Sansa was aware of this.

Now all this said, I didn't think Sansa would get what she wanted in the end. I thought the Dany Magical Mary Sue Targaryen would get everything she wanted from the 7 Kingdoms, right down the list to the miracle Baby exclamation point. And for Sansa to live unhappily ever after getting instructions ravened to her (from Daenerys/Tyrion/The Royal Court) for the rest of her life. I think it makes sense for Sansa to throw a Hail Mary, political sucker punch at Daenerys. I don't know how successful it would be, but why not try. If she had waited until the war was over, the game would have been over. At least any chance she had of influencing it.",55,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

I had wanted him to lose ever since he betrayed Ned Stark but all the while I admired how he played the game and only wanted him to lose in a fitting way. That unfortunately did not happen. No Villain can ever scheme against the good guys if Bran is in the picture. 

Then in Season 8 people were mad why Bran didn't inform that Euron's fleet was looking out for a sneak attack. See something here? Whatever happens people won't be satisfied. Because the 3 eyed raven is just such an overpowered figure that him taking sides in human conflict makes it difficult to have interesting narratives. If he uses all his powers then it makes for boring drama and if he doesn't then it becomes a plot hole as to why he didn't.

In the battle against the army of the dead it was fine to have him. That didn't seem unfair or didn't make it one sided. But imagine if Stannis had Bran on his side in the Battle of Blackwater Bay? No wildfire trap or anything like that would work. No surprise entry from Tywin catching them off guard. It would totally kill the dynamics of war in that world.

He should have been presented as someone who will always be neutral in human conflict like some sort of three eyed raven vow. Or make sense of it any other way to limit his powers beyond fighting the army of the dead.

Dany wasn't wrong in doubting that it's all so convenient that only his brother knows about Jon's true parentage with literally no one else to verify it. Sam can only verify the marriage which still has nothing to do with confirming who Jon really is. Bran is like a cheat code to solve problems that didn't seem to have a natural solution and that in my opinion is bad storytelling.",20,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

There was a book that I read recently called Norse Mythology - Neil Gaiman. 


In the book I read about Odin the all-father. The book stated that when Odin was in his human form he looked like, a tall man, wearing a cloak and hat. 
Now for the more important part of my theory. When Odin is in his human form he normally has two ravens, who fly around the world and report everything to Odin. Therefore he is able to see everything. 


Odin also hung from the world tree for nine days or nine nights, until he fell. This could signify when Bran fell out of the tower in episode one. 


So I believe that George R.R.Martin, may have got some inspiration for Bran via Odin the Norse God.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been studying machine learning for the last few months and wanted to see if I could build a writing tool with what I learned. For Game of Thrones models, I took the books and then using an existing dataset (GPT-2) - applied training on top of it. It was a bit of pain to clean up the data, just making sure the model would take it and understand the texts, but I finally got it working! The code running this app is also open-sourced if you're interested in that also.

The output was an interesting, albeit slightly crazy, algorithm that will generate game of thrones style language as you're writing.

   **Let this post be a warning for September 22 of 2019**. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss will attend the Emmy Awards and a trailer-video will air, announcing the movie  -""**A Dream of Spring**""-. The moment Bran warged in episode 3 he started dreaming.  Half episode 3 until episode 6 of Season 8 is Bran's dream of a possible reality happening in the future. The events that happened were happening inside his mind, based on his interpretation. The writers of the TV series knew this will amaze the fans and that's the reason for their long absence in the public record since the finale aired. They have no choice but to reveal and explain themselves by that time.

*-I am only writing this so that anyone who reads it will know that my speculations will be correct-*

I wailed for the seasons we never had. All that time, energy, interest, passion invested into this noble art piece wasn't reciprocated. Game of Thrones did something special for the world and we still have the books thanks to GRRM. I just wish the quality could've maintained.

The World isn't ready yet to deliver such a master piece of noble art.

We will get there. Someday. I just hope I am here to see it.  
Sorry guys, after all this months it hit me the sorrow of never having more Game of Thrones in my life, and feeling utterly disappointed since season 5. Game of Thrones was my escape from this shitty world. Into something so amazing I couldn't believed existed. I am not here to discuss what has been discussed to point out what went wrong where etc. I am just here to have a moment to wail. For the best TV series the World has ever seen that inspired all of us, entertained all of us and betrayed all of us.

Game of Thrones, you are missed since season 5.

Roose was way too clever for that and as you saw later on in the show once Tywin died Roose could care less about Tommen.

I want to follow less characters than the show does, to decrease the runtime and simplify the plot by removing unnecessary elements. 

My main focus will be the Starks (not including Jon Snow, at least until his reunion with Sansa in Season 6), since they are technically the main characters of the story. The reason I am not following Jon Snow during the earlier seasons is because his plotline doesnt really interact with the others until much later on. I would like to include him, but I cant figure out how to make his storylines fit in well with the other characters. 

I will also occasionally follow characters that are important and impact the overall plot (Such as Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen, but Ive already figured out how to include the gist of their plots). But which other characters are the most important, in your opinion?

Please note that the pre-Westeros Daenerys Targaryen plotlines will be covered as post-credits scenes in films 1-6, with only the most important sequences (Such as Daeneryss dragons being born, and Daenerys freeing the Unsullied) being included.

I was inspired to make these edits by this post:

In the first season itself, when news about Bran's fall had spread already. In one of the scenes, where Tyrion and Jaime discuss about Bran's condition. Jaime says it's better to be dead than be a cripple for life. At this Tyrion comments ""Death is so final. But life... Life is full of possibilities.""

Yeah, without the ending known, this comment seems to be just an optimistic viewpoint, but now that we know how the story ends, it can be more so that this was an intentional clue for the viewers.

Season 1 was the time when HBO had Martin's books as source material to follow, combine this with the fact that the idea for A Song Of Ice And Fire was conceived by Martin when he had the vision of a young boy seeing a man beheaded and finding wolf pups in the snow popped into his head. That became the first chapter of the book (after a very cold open), with that young boyBran Stark.

So, this could very well be why we found Bran to end up at top, and not Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen. In my opinion, the ending would have been more justifiable if HBO did not rush the ending and pulled another 1 or 2 season to continue that slow pace.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I still cannot get over how this show turned out. I get random stray thoughts on a nearly daily basis on how piss poor this show ended. Perhaps it's because I recently bought some songs from S8 soundtrack that it's really drudging up negative feelings, but it's just such a waste.

If the show had been bad on multiple fronts, things would not feel so empty and unsatisfying, but the music, direction, cinematography, special fx, and acting were at such a peak that if the writing had just been more logical and consistent and not so rushed and forced, we could have had a perfect ending or at least something less boring than what we got.

I still can't believe that possibly the greatest villain I have seen on screen just stood by a window and waited for her useless kept man to secure her victory. That Jon became a mindless parody of himself, that Arya was just a badass plot device, that Tyrion seemingly lost all his cunning and wits, that Jaime totally abandoned a decade of development over the course of one episode, and that Daenerys, went from savior willing to sacrifice her dreams, goals, and even her children for the greater good to Hitler all in one episode and that the development for that heel turn was relegated to a freaking episode recap.

I could write a dissertation on this and I am sure many already have, but it still bothers me how poorly they handled such a great story. Don't think I will ever get closure until I read the Winds of Winter. Just need to vent out my frustration since all my friends and family are really casual fans who while also disappointed, can't really appreciate just how bad this was.",66,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

He said he stopped reading stuff about his character online after season 2 because it was hard to avoid internalizing the hate for his character. 

I imagine it couldnt have been easy with this being his breakout role and all of the massively increased attention and spotlight on him, even having come from a family of actors and growing up among them.

He did a hell of a good job with this show, and I genuinely will be disappointed if he does not win the Emmy he nominated himself for. He killed it from beginning to end.

Unlike most people I don't really mind that she did this, but that's not important here.

The NK grabs her throat just the same, makes his cocky smile and kills her by crushing her throat. As the dagger is falling down, Bran wargs into Arya's dead body, her blue eyes open, then grabs the dagger and stabs the NK just like it happened in the show. 

This give the entire Bran story line so much better. Also gives a better ending to Arya. Gets rid of both fan complaints of 1: no main character death in the episode, 2: Arya being the one who kills him, and 3: Bran doing nothing important the entire fight.",11,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jaime and Dany - yes, they had the trial but a proper one to one wouldve been nice. Jaime explaining why he killed her father, similar to the Brienne bath scene. Perhaps a bit about Cersei.

Cersei and Sansa - this one would be hard to justify but wouldve been nice to for Cersei to witness, and perhaps admire, the strong woman Sansa had become.

Cersei and Dany - again difficult but huge rivals with barely any dialogue between them at all.

Arya and Dany - dragons.

Arya and the Lannisters - especially Cersei. Theyd always assumed she was dead. 

Jaime and Sansa - bit about Brienne and the oath to her mother.

Jon and Jaime - perhaps a nod to their S1 conversation. 

The Hound and Tyrion/Jaime - about Joffrey.

Sure Ive missed some and of course it all comes back to how rushed the final season was. The dialogue between the many fascinating characters was a key part of the early seasons, and these reunions/meetings were something I was very much looking forward to.

Jon had a more emotional reunion with Sansa at Castle Black than he did with Arya at Winterfell, which should never have been the case.

I was **really** hoping Bran's destiny would culminate in something evil.

For a messy ending. For Daenarys to KNOW that Jon was gonna try and kill her. For her to get stabbed and for her wound to be cauterised by dragonfire.

For him to solidify not being Bran anymore by,  perhaps, stabbing Jon Snow with dragonglass against the tree. For his  motive to defeat the Night King to be the creation of another stronger  Night King, under his control. One that would give more meaning to the  whole Night King arc.

For everything we thought about a useless  character or the Binary of Lannister vs Stark ""Good vs Evil"" to be  thrown into the trash.

For Daenarys to have a tragic villain arc instead of a random switch flip after the ringing of the surrender bells.

 See: The reason people are disappointed with this season is that it  took all the magic and plot built up from the previous seasons and did a  major disservice to them.

Every character has a Hero's Journey  in them in this series, running simultaneously with multiple characters.  The only thing that can cut these journeys short while still feeling  satisfying is death. And even those need an appropriate amount of weight  to them to feel like it's alright.

Bran  
 Arya  
 Cersei  
 Jaime  
 Tyrion  
 Jon  
 Sansa

Each of these had a journey.

 For Bran, it was his adventure to the North to fulfill his destiny of  becoming the Three-Eyed Raven. What did that culimate into? Well. The  biggest thing he did was tell Jon that he's a Targaryan. Besides that he  went white-eyed during the advance of the Night King. What was SO  IMPORTANT that he was seeing it while death approaches? Idk. We'll never  know. It apparently doesn't matter. 

(Over here, a great insert  would have been to show him warg into Arya and force her into the place  she needs to be to fight the Night King. That'd not only show us Bran  actually being useful, but close the plothole of Arya sneaking through  the dead, and make the whole scene ultimately more satisfying)

 Bran had no motive and no ambitions. After coming back from north of the  wall, he was about as bland a character as you can imagine.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 For Arya, her adventure was to be a female warrior and break free from  the structure that held her down. She succeeded at doing so,  brilliantly. Transitioning from different phases.

From a violent  girl, to a scared but overconfident and ready student, to a scarred  survivor, to a warrior-in-training under The Hound, to a Cold Assassin,  No-One. She then finished her arc by taking out The Night King. With so  short a fight, and the logical lapses, it wasn't as satisfying an ending  to the arc as one would have hoped. So people held out hope that it was  just a fake-out finish and she'll have some ending to her arc that  satisfies them. 

To no avail.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Cersei  had multiple brilliant transformations, the details of which I won't  bother going into. The ratings of episodes before Season 8 kind of speak  for themselves. She was always this sly ruler who you couldn't help but  admire for how she outsmarted everyone. 

Her whole deal was that   
 if opportunityExists:  
Seize\_It();  
  She would amaze us time and time again by always finding a way to come  out on top. Not even trying to show her trying to implement any backup  plan (Despite subtly showing the Greek Fire triggered by the dragonfire  and her Dragon-killing bows) is uncharacteristic of her. Her desperation  and wit was almost absent in the last episode aside from her crying  that she doesn't want to die. She made 0 calls of her own and failed  entirely to even TRY to implement any of her tactics.

(Y'know what they could have written here to both make Daenarys a tragic villain AND make Cersei's death more satisfying?

 For Cersei to order the explosion of the Greek Fire in her last ditch  effort to defeat the northerners, knowing full well that it won't kill  the dragon but still getting one in to go like ""Ha, you can kill me but  I'll bite back till the last moment"", killing almost everyone, and also  making it look like, to the northerners, that it was Daenarys's  dragonfire that triggered the explosion.

This should have  happened after Daenarys stayed true to her nature and bee-lined the Red  Keep and started burning it. If the place is exploding from below,  they'll think Daenarys triggered it cuz fire caused explosions of fire  caches and she was warned against it anyways.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Jaime.

 He fulfilled his plot and tbh I think it's fitting that he died  pathetically at the end. It fulfilled the prophecy, and it really gives  you that bitter realisation that you can't escape fate. That his love  for Cersei was twisted, and even though he knows he's a disgusting  person for having that love, continues to do so.

I don't think he was as wasted this season as the rest.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Tyrion.

 I suppose you can't blame his character for getting nerfed as hard as  he did. He's been calling shots poorly since Season 6. Him failing in  this Season is no big thing. There WAS something missing but I can't  quite put my finger on it. 

His arc was completed seasons ago. I  don't really know what more there is to discuss about him. He could have  literally died for shock value in this season and nothing would have  changed too drastically.

His role in the last episode made absolutely no sense.  
 Everybody just...agreed? That Bran should be King?  
 I doubt anybody besides Sansa and Arya would respect the fact that he's the Three-eyed Raven. Nobody would give a hoot.

Why did anybody care about Tyrion's speech? They should have laughed at it as much as they laughed at that other dude.  
 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Jon.

""She is my queen.""  
 ""She is my queen.""  
 ""She is my Q W E E N.""

\*Sees her burn people and go against his core values\*  
 \*Kills Queen\*

That's about the most predictable plot they could have possibly built up in this season. 

Him being Aegon Targaryen had no impact whatsoever in this entire season besides being a topic of discussion.

 (A nice insert here would be to give that some value in the finale.  Such as his execution being interrupted by Drogon, who breathes fire on  his execution block and him surviving, making it relevant that he's a  Targaryan.)

(Or for him to have died altogether in the finale and  for stuff to go haywire. Everybody expects him to win, and something  HAS to go wrong in the whole season. If Daenarys expected him to try and  kill her, she could have gotten stabbed, grabbed Jon and held the blade  inside her, had Drogon burn her, and walk out of there, the unburnt.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sansa had no role in the finale. She's the only one who acted normal AT ALL in the final debate on who the King should be.

At this point in writing this post, I don't even feel like talking about what could have been different here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

EDIT:

Rhaegal.

What's impossible is:   
  1 - Not seeing those ships, even if Daenerys is blind, the lookouts on  her ships would have seen them miles away in broad daylight. 

2 -  The angle of those shots, from that far away the angle should be the  same with the spacing of those ships, however the one that pierces  Rhaegals neck comes atleast 40 degress anticlockwise to the others. 

 3 - Hitting with your first attempt shooting at a dragon over 2 miles  away with a subsonic weapon with unpredictable wind between. 

Reminder: They will have had no experience shooting those weapons at aerial moving targets. 

4 - Hitting all three of your shots at said dragon.

 5 - Actually having enough velocity left in the scorpion arrow to  pierce dragon-skin after shooing a couple miles into the air in the open  seas where there must be a tonne of wind.

If we assumed that the  first shot was a super lucky shot, what would have made more sense AND  been more satisfying is for Rhaegal to have descended to a considerable  degree after the first shot, trying to recover and then getting BARRAGED  by scorpion shots.

A believable and satisfying kill.",9,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, Ive always felt that ASOIAF and GOT were more of a dark satire of the entire High Fantasy genre. This season was definitely a masterpiece of over-the-top setpieces, impending doom, and shifting alliances and bittersweet resolutions.

I was thinking of the 1999 film ELECTION, where a pathetic high school teacher becomes involved with a student body presidential election, and how it reminded me of game of thrones. In that film the popular, but dim-witted jock faces the angry, ruthless and ambitious girl for the presidency of a high school. Similarly Jon Snow and Daenerys were both popular and/or ambitious but the logical and intelligent people were mostly relegated to the background. By the end, we have a proper outcome. Bran, the boy who fell...etc., and the wise dwarf were both the better choice for leadership. Tyrion was the cynical but intelligent leader, and Bran was the crippled, cold, efficient but profoundly just ruler. 

The pacing and writing of this season was meant to reflect the chaos and anxiety of supporting these Heroes against the Villains . By the end,  we are left with an intellectually satisfying conclusion rather than a purely emotional one.  

There were definitely some great emotional moments, but like most conflicts, the characters were weary and did not have the energy to muster the political guile that everyone expected from the earlier seasons. Its unfortunate too many in the audience didnt follow that notion, or were confused by the lack of wit in the dialogue and plotting. There does come a point where every character has to face the consequences of their actions, and only the most clever people can sort out the mess they leave behind in the aftermath.  

I do think Benihoff and Weiss were generous to the Jon Snow fans, and actually gave him a more heroic arc than he might receive in GRRMs ASOIAF.  He is not burdened by his own charisma, and can spend his days in happiness beyond the wall. I could see Jon Snow becoming a version of coldhands in the books. 

The Dwarf and The Cripple are burdened with leadership, while the strong Hero who would be king rides off into the wintery sunset. That is a snarky and satisfying ending. I do believe this season deserves high recognition, and it would be proper to award season 8 with a best dramedy award. The Best Drama of 2019 will have to suffice.",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Its an Arya chapter, where Rose Bolton is being leeched. Hes speaking with a (I think) Northerner, and Arya overhears while being Boltons cup bearer. Hes telling Bolton how the Rob has no chance to defeat Tywin in the war, and how he has no brothers left. This is the first Arya bears of this, and she realizes that as far as she knows Rickon and Bran are dead. Now I wonder is this the very moment that starts to sway Bolton to betrayal. Not only is someone telling him basically hes fighting for the losing side, BUT also how Robb has no heirs. To me this opens Boltons eyes to realize he can take over the North due to this fact. While in reality Bran and Rickon are alive, in theory Theon is the ultimate reason causing Roose to be a traitor, and thus killing Robb. If Theon never claimed to have killed the Stark brothers Roose knows their would be still Heirs to winterfell and I dont think would have done what he did.

1447,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-9-24,2019,9,24,8,d8f0nj,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILER] Dany's Ending was not as bad as everyone keeps claiming. Here's why I think so.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d8f0nj/spoiler_danys_ending_was_not_as_bad_as_everyone/,KriminalDrama,1569282342,"I see that many people replied to one of my comments on another post where I stated that Dany's ending was indeed great character development and parallelism. Here's my reasoning and response to people saying that there were no previous actions by Dany that could have foreshadowed her ending.

1.

Character Development in most literature is done by a character progressively developing into their end, where their actions foreshadow their ending. However, this was not the case with Dany, rightfully so. Her development wasn't in her actions but the actions against her, her words, and her thoughts. She can clearly be seen as straying away from that innocent little girl that got married off by her brother throughout the series. Although she did not ""act"" as brutally, her thoughts and words clearly showed that she was capable. Numerous allies had to advise against some of her brutal tactics.

This is how it works in real life. Take school shooters for an example. The number of school shooters that shot up groups of people prior to shooting up a school are little to none. Most of them could be passed off as quiet kids, not mass murderers. They simply snapped, similar to Dany.

2.

The parallelism between the Mad King and Dany. I think Dany's story beautifully designs what possibly could have been the Mad King's story. Throughout the series we're all thinking the Mad King was cruel, especially when he kept saying ""burn them all"" (there's some foreshadowing for you). Maybe now that we see Dany actually burning them all, we can sympathize with him as we did with Dany throughout the series. Maybe he had gone through just as much trauma as Dany and eventually snapped.

Not to mention Aegon the Conquerer also burned numerous people to create and claim the Iron Throne. The throne that Dany was after since the beginning was literally made with the burning of numerous people.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

There was a book that I read recently called Norse Mythology - Neil Gaiman. 

In the book I read about Odin the all-father. The book stated that when Odin was in his human form he looked like, a tall man, wearing a cloak and hat. 
Now for the more important part of my theory. When Odin is in his human form he normally has two ravens, who fly around the world and report everything to Odin. Therefore he is able to see everything. 

Odin also hung from the world tree for nine days or nine nights, until he fell. This could signify when Bran fell out of the tower in episode one. 

So I believe that George R.R.Martin, may have got some inspiration for Bran via Odin the Norse God.",2,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

1) Tyrion's ''confession'' at the Vale.

2) Tyrion's speech to the Lannister army at the Battle of Blackwater.

3) Tyrion's trial in King's Landing, where he was falsely accused of murdering Joffrey.

Personally, all three of them were awesome...just in different ways. The Vale confession did a great job showcasing Tyrion's wits and excellent sense of humor (at the expense of others). The Blackwater speech was just super epic and somehow cynical while in a weird way also being inspirational and even noble. The KL speech was both heartbreaking and insanely powerful, where Tyrion finally managed to let out a lot of his pent-up anger and hate at the way people treated him for being a dwarf as well as the way his own family and lover conspired to betray him.

I'd rank them in the following order: 3, 2, and 1. Peter Dinklage did a brilliant job in all three cases, but the first two speeches literally give me the chills. The first one is so good I can't help rewatching it every now and then.

Which one would you choose?

I still believe, that the Night King was the good guy in the story, and the 'good guys' supported the real villain, Brandon Stark without their knowledge.

He obviously manipulated the events of history (just think about the history of the Valyrian dagger), that led not only to the creation and death of the Night King (who can be also his pawn without the NK's knowledge), but also resulted his reign. Bran clearly stated, that  it was the only purpose of his travel, therefore he must have been sure what'll happen. And told to Jon and Theon, that they were exactly where they had to be. Just as Arya, Berric Melisandre and Sandor. Therefore, everyone else had to be in the perfect place according to a plan (that also include events like the death of Daenerys).

Bran  had the ability to manipulate the past, therefore he must be able to control the future. Even tho ""The ink is dry"", what happened has already happened or will happen (time can be confusing). But has control over events of the past, present and future.

Everything led to where he is: on the throne. As a King, he is now able to control the present without using his powers.

About the powers of The Lord of Light: I think this is a state he will achieve later, when he ascend to be a 'god'.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. The Laws of Gods and Men. It contains his best scene in the show, both for his character and for the actor himself. Didn't win because of a great performance by Aaron Paul and last season of BB.

2. Blackwater. The favorite episode of every Tyrion fan and Tyrion at his best.
3.THE IRON THRONE. Yes, in this episode Dinklage totally shines. Crying scenes, defiant looks, profound speeches and comic moments.

4.The Dragon and the Wolf. That scene with Cersei was enough for the Emmy. Peter had only one episode with worthy material, he chose it, he won. At the Emmys one episode is enough.

5.Baelor. The soft side of Tyrion comes out. Dinklage had limited screentime if compared to the previous choices, a true episode for a supporting actor, but the character was so groundbreaking that he was on everyone's mouth in 2011. And he deservedly won.

6.Second sons. He didn't have lots to do in season 3 honestly, but again this episode showcases his talent. Angry glares to Joffrey and his father and an over-the-top drunk behaviour that we will never see again in Tyrion.

7.Hardhome. Two great scenes with Emilia Clarke. And that's it. Dinklage had little screentime all spread out in season 5, less than 10 minutes per episode generally. And this was certainly a make up win for the previous year.

8.No One. Season six is the least interesting season for Tyrion. The only important events were his scene with the dragons and the Hand appointment. But in that episode he still shows range and he got nominated for it.

As you can see, his wins for season 8 and 7 are actually quite high, because acting wise, they're really strong episodes.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

As a character she has had a very excellent character arc among the ""villain"" characters in the story. She starts off as a powerless but vindictive woman who basically lives in fear and resentment. We don't see her take real action to actually do something strategic until she kills King Robert. This is done through a proxy of course so she does not truly get her hands dirty. In fact her unwillingness to really sully her hands herself is a big part of all her schemes.

But as the series progresses she gets bolder, and bolder in the lengths she is willing to go in order to protect her children and grasp power. After 5 seasons of using proxies and behind the scenes schemes, we see her fully come into her own in the season 6 finale. Her plan to simply blow up her enemies and declare herself Queen of the 7 Kingdoms is a big turning point. She's done hiding, she'd done relying on behind the scenes plots and secret schemes and using others to gain power or ruling through people. It's her game now. Even in season 7 this character growth continues as she has no issue openly sleeping with Jaime, and even manages to finally outsmart Tyrion who has always been a step ahead.

All of this is thrown away in season 8. We again see a character who is passive, relying on someone else to do her dirty work. This woman who has spent so much of the series rising to her own power, stepping over countless corpses to get there mostly stares out a window for season 8, has few great scenes of her own and when the final battle with Daenerys comes to King's Landing, much to my own surprise, her only plan is to shoot Dany with the scorpions. Like that's it? Your relying on Euron alone to do this? No other plans of tricks up your sleeves? Just seemed very regressive and very out of character for her and was one of my most disliked aspects of the season.

Idk, maybe i'm totally misreading things but it's just something I wanted to get off my chest that plagues my mind whenever I think of the series.",20,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here are some of the atrocities he performs in the books

The Reaver (AFfC)

&gt; The feast was good. The wine was of the best, and there was roast ox, rare and bloody, and stuffed ducks as well, and buckets of fresh crabs. The serving wenches wore fine woolens and plush velvets, the Lord Captain did not fail to note. He took them for scullions dressed up in the clothes of Lady Hewett and her ladies, until Hotho told him they were Lady Hewett and her ladies. It amused the Crows Eye to make them wait and pour. There were eight of them: her ladyship herself, still handsome though grown somewhat stout, and seven younger women aged from twenty-five to ten, her daughters and good-daughters.
&gt;Lord Hewett himself sat in his accustomed place upon the dais, dressed in all his heraldic finery. His arms and legs had been tied to his chair, and a huge white radish shoved between his teeth so he could not speak ... though he could see and hear. The Crows Eye had claimed the place of honor at his lordships right hand. A pretty, buxom girl of seventeen or eighteen years was in his lap, barefoot and disheveled, her arms around his neck. Who is that? Victarion asked the men around him.
&gt;His lordships bastard daughter, laughed Hotho. Before Euron took the castle, she was made to wait at table on the rest and take her own meals with the servants.
&gt; Euron put his blue lips to her throat, and the girl giggled and whispered something in his ear. Smiling, he kissed her throat again. Her white skin was covered with red marks where his mouth had been; they made a rosy necklace about her neck and shoulders. Another whisper in his ear, and this time the Crows Eye laughed aloud, then slammed his wine cup down for silence. Good ladies, he called out to his highborn serving women, Falia is concerned for your fine gowns. She would not have them stained with grease and wine and dirty groping fingers, since I have promised that she may choose her own clothes from your wardrobes after the feast. So you had best disrobe.
&gt;A roar of laughter washed over the great hall, and Lord Hewetts face turned so red that Victarion thought his head might burst. The women had no choice but to obey. The youngest one cried a little, but her mother comforted her and helped undo the laces down her back. Afterward, they continued to serve as before, moving along the tables with flagons full of wine to fill each empty cup, only now they did so naked.
&gt;He shames Hewett as he once shamed me, the captain thought, remembering how his wife had sobbed as he was beating her. The men of the Four Shields oft married one another, he knew, just as the ironborn did. One of these naked serving wenches might well be Ser Talbert Serrys wife. It was one thing to kill a foe, another to dishonor him. Victarion made a fist. His hand was bloody where his wound had soaked through the linen.

The Forsaken (TWoW)

&gt; The Crows Eye came below again, lantern in hand. This time his other hand held a dagger. Still praying, priest? Your god has forsaken you.
&gt;Youre wrong.
&gt;It was me who taught you how to pray, little brother. Have you forgotten? I would visit your bed chamber at night when I had too much to drink. You shared a room with Urrigon high up in the seatower. I could hear you praying from outside the door. I always wondered: Were you praying that I would choose you or that I would pass you by? Euron pressed the knife to Aerons throat.
&gt;Pray to me. Beg me to end your torment, and I will.
&gt;Not even you would dare, said the Damphair. I am your brother. No man is more accursed than the kinslayer.
&gt;And yet I wear a crown and you rot in chains. How is it that your Drowned God allows that when I have killed three brothers?
&gt;Aeron could only gape at him. Three?
&gt;Well, if you count half-brothers. Do you remember little Robin? Wretched creature. Do you remember that big head of his, how soft it was? All he could do was mewl and shit. He was my second. Harlon was my first. All I had to do was pinch his nose shut. The greyscale had turned his mouth to stone so he could not cry out. But his eyes grew frantic as he died. They begged me. When the life went out of them, I went out and pissed into the sea, waiting for the god to strike me down. None did. Oh, and Balon was the third, but you knew that. I could not do the deed myself, but it was my hand that pushed him off the bridge.
&gt;The Crows Eye pressed the dagger in a little deeper, and Aeron felt blood trickling down his neck. If your Drowned God did not smite me for killing three brothers, why should he bestir himself for the fourth? Because you are his priest?
&gt;He stepped back and sheathed his dagger. No, Ill not kill you tonight. A holy man with holy blood. I may have need of that that blood  later. For now, you are condemned to live.
&gt;A holy man with holy blood, Aeron thought when his brother had climbed back onto the deck.

The same chapter

&gt; Once, in the dungeon before this one, a woman brought his food in place of Eurons mute. A young thing, buxom and pretty. She dressed in the finery of a greenland lady. In the lantern light she was the loveliest thing Aeron had ever seen.
&gt;Woman, he said, I am a man of god. I command you, set me free.
&gt;Oh, I couldnt do that, she said. I have food for you. Porridge and honey. She sat beside him on a stool and spooned it into his mouth for him.
&gt;What is this place? he asked between spoonfuls.
&gt;My lord fathers castle on Oakenshield. The Shield Islands, a thousand leagues from home.
&gt;And who are you, child?
&gt;Falia Flowers, Lord Hewetts natural daughter. I am to be King Eurons salt wife. You and I will be kin, then. Aeron Damphair raised his eyes to hers. His scabbed lips were crusted with wet porridge. Woman. His chains clinked when he moved. Run. He will hurt you. He will kill you.
&gt;She laughed. Silly, he wont. Im his love, his lady. He gives me gifts, so many gifts. Silks and furs and jewels. Rags and rocks, he calls them.
&gt;The Crows Eye puts no value in such things. That was one of the things that drew men to his service. Most captains kept the lions share of their plunder but Euron took almost nothing for himself.
&gt;He gives me any gown I want, the girl was prattling happily. My sisters used to make me wait on them at table, but Euron made them serve the whole hall naked! Why should he do that, except for love of me? She put a hand on her belly and smoothed down the fabric of her gown.
&gt;Im going to give him sons. So many sons 
&gt;He has sons.
&gt;Baseborn boys and mongrels, Euron says. My sons will come before them, he has sworn, sworn by your own Drowned God!
&gt;Aeron wouldve wept for her. Tears of blood, he thought. You must bear a message to my brother. Not Euron, but Victarion, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet. Do you know the man I mean?
&gt;Falia sat back from him. Yes, she said. But I couldnt bring him any messages. Hes gone.
&gt;Gone? That was the cruelest blow of all. Gone where?
&gt;East, she said, with all his ships. Hes to bring the dragon queen to Westeros. Im to be Eurons salt wife, but he must have a rock wife too, a queen to rule all Westeros at his side. They say shes the most beautiful woman in the world, and she has dragons. The two of us will be as close as sisters!
&gt;Aeron Damphair hardly heard her. Victarion is gone, half a world away or dead. Surely the Drowned God was testing him. This was a lesson for him. Put not your trust in men. Only my faith can save me now.

Later on...
&gt; When they were well out to sea, Euron returned to him. Brother, he said, you look forlorn. I have a gift for you.
&gt;He beckoned, and two of his bastard sons dragged the woman forward and bound her to the prow on the other side of the figurehead. Naked as the mouthless maiden, her smooth belly just beginning to swell with the child she was carrying, her cheeks red with tears, she did not struggle as the boys tightened her bonds. Her hair hung down in front of her face, but Aeron knew her all the same.
&gt;Falia Flowers, he called. Have courage, girl! All this will be over soon, and we will feast together in the Drowned Gods watery halls.
&gt;The girl raised up her head, but made no answer. She has no tongue to answer with, the Damphair knew. He licked his lips, and tasted salt.

And of course the visions Aeron had while he drank shade of the evening
&gt; Euron produced a carved stone bottle and a wine cup. You have a thirsty look about you, he said as he poured. You need a drink; a taste of evenings shade.
&gt;No. Aeron turned his face away. No, I said.
&gt;And I said yes. Euron pulled his head back by the hair and forced the vile liquor into his mouth again. Though Aeron clamped his mouth shut, twisting his head from side to side he fought as best he could, but in the end he had to choke or swallow.
&gt;The dreams were even worse the second time. He saw the longships of the Ironborn adrift and burning on a boiling blood-red sea. He saw his brother on the Iron Throne again, but Euron was no longer human. He seemed more squid than man, a monster fathered by a kraken of the deep, his face a mass of writhing tentacles. Beside him stood a shadow in womans form, long and tall and terrible, her hands alive with pale white fire. Dwarves capered for their amusement, male and female, naked and misshapen, locked in carnal embrace, biting and tearing at each other as Euron and his mate laughed and laughed and laughed 
&gt;Aeron dreamed of drowning, too. Not of the bliss that would surely follow down in the Drowned Gods watery halls, but of the terror that even the faithful feel as the water fills their mouth and nose and lungs, and they cannot draw a breath. Three times the Damphair woke, and three times it proved no true waking, but only another chapter in a dream. But at last, there came a day when the door of the dungeon swung open, and a mute came splashing through with no food in his hands. Instead he had a ring of keys in one hand, and a lantern in the other. The light was too bright to look upon, and Aeron was afraid of what it meant. Bright and terrible. Something has changed. Something has happened.

Speaking of Shade of the Evening, heres what happened to its original owner
&gt; Last were two warlocks of the east, with flesh as white as mushrooms, and lips the purplish-blue of a bad bruise, all so gaunt and starved that only skin and bones remained. One had lost his legs. The mutes hung him from a rafter. Pree, he cried as he swung back and forth. Pree, Pree!

With all of this in mind, I think it would be impossible to properly portray Euron especially after what the show had gone through with rape scene involving Ramsay and Sansa. It is a shame though since Euron is my favorite villain in the books.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The man was obese from years, if not decades, of overeating and drinking. He hadn't fought anyone in years, as he himself pointed out. Not to mention, he was even more intoxicated than usual, due to drinking extra extra strong-wine that Lancel had prepared for him at Cersei's command. In the end, the boar was able to do to King Robert what the Night King failed to do to Jon or Dany - kill a powerful monarch, and in turn cause a massive crisis to overtake the world.

Yet we must not remember that Bobby B did not go gentle into the night, oh no. Bobby B made sure to take the beast down with him, even as rusty as he was due to decades of not fighting, on top of him having let himself go to binge drinking and eating, on top of him being even more intoxicated than usual due to Cersei's evil plots. The beast was then cooked and produced enough meat to seemingly feed Tyrion and Jaime all the way into S4, where the brothers are reunited after a series of events separated them in S1 alone (including the war that the boar had unwittingly caused).

Knowing that the US is about to deal with its own boar invasion from Canada and knowing that Robert in his prime was a beast of a man, how many boars do you think Robert could kill on his own? Assume that he has his war hammer, badass stag helmet, glowing eyes, the works, etc... Assume that he will fight 30-50 feral hogs on his own. If that's too unfair to Robert, cut that number in half.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

One of the biggest criticisms slung season 8's way is the fact that Tyrion is the biggest moron in the room. Either because he told Gary's, or withheld the information about the secret passage behind the Red Keep from Dany, making the whole conflict of the last two seasons feel pointless. 

I can't help but feel those who feel this way are missing the larger picture. Of course Dany could have easily won if she torched the Red Keep from the word ""go."" But it was stated in 'Stormborn' by Tyrion that the goal is to win Westeros, not the throne. That means the people, and not filling them with terror that will only cause the same resistance Dany met in Slaver's Bay. 

I won't say that Tyrion was a genius but he was a changed man from the miserable state he was in as a result of the final straw that was his mock trial. He wanted to helo her make the world a better place, even if it meant forging hairbrained schemes at the last minute like having Jaime convince Cersei to surrender. 

Also Tyrion told Varys about Jon because he was the Master of Whispers and figured he wouls best know how to deal with information that could put their queen in jeopardy. Tyrion didn't consider that Varys would turn traitor",43,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

What do you all think? Do the later seasons (if you dislike them) sour the experience of the first half of the show? Or do seasons 5 through 8 not affect your feelings? OR do you think the entire show is great?",29,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

When was that mission assignment to her? Cause never *once* did Mel ever say anything about ice and fire (until she did)?

Why does the LoL believe Stannis is the PtwP for such a ridiculously long amount of time? Especially when ice and fire hold so much importance, and why is Mel the only priest or priestess who is actively trying to guide the major players? True, Quaithe plays a larger role in the books, but why isn't she a close advisor to Dany as Mel is to Stannis, when Dany plays such in integral part? And what about ice? You send Mel to Stannis, **who is obviously not the ice of the equation**, while having *no other* priests(esses) search for the ice?

There is ample proof that the LoL is real, so why does it take so long for him/it to get his/it's shit together?? 

If he/it is actually on the side of the dead then way to fuckin go, loser, your plan to backfired. 

If he/it is on the side of the living then ya better step your fuckin game up next time!",3,6,False,spoiler,,,,,
