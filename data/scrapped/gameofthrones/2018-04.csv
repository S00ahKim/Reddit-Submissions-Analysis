(This is a little different than I've seen elsewhere.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/88nl15/spoilers_burn_them_all_theory_this_is_a_little/,PhenderMan,1522548699,"Sorry if this isn't new.  I tried to find something about this idea online, because it just came to me today while rewatching the show.  I have a hard time believing I'm the first to think this, but occasionally I have an original idea.  I've read great ideas elsewhere that have inspired this and are related to this, but nothing exactly like this.  

This idea came to me as I watched the funeral of Hoster Tully, in which the Blackfish steps in to set his brother ablaze.  That caused me to think about how bodies are disposed of in Westeros. Simultaneously, I happened to have read an idea about Bran possibly watching over his family and them hearing voices.  I am not the first to propose that Bran has probably tried to communicate with the Mad King, but interpretations are different than this one.

Here is the basic idea:

1. In ""The Faith of the Seven"", they actually preserve the bodies of the dead in a manner that I would refer to as mummification.(http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faith_of_the_Seven#Funeral_customs).

2. It is well known that the Mad King heard voices in his head and it is also well known that he said to ""burn them all"" more than once and that as he was dying he said this over and over (not unlike a certain instance in which a door needed to be held and this was repeated over and over).  

3. The followers of the ""Lord of Light"" worship fire/light in a sense, and Malisandre says ""fire is the purest death"".

4. We know what Bran is capable of in terms of communication through time.  

I propose that Bran's ability to communicate through time is imperfect, at best.  What he is really trying to do is to get these people to burn their dead so that they cannot be used as meat in the army of the others.  The Mad King wasn't burying the Wildfire to destroy Kings Landing.  He was preparing so that all of the mummies beneath the city could not rise when the Others arrive.  When he says ""burn them all"" it is either a misinterpretation on his part or the part of his audience.  He is actually referring to the dead. 
In other words, don't preserve them.  Burn them.  

In the case of the Red Priestesses, Malisandre has made it clear that it is difficult to interpret what she's sees at times.  Perhaps her religion has taken this to an extreme, by cleansing the living with fire, when they were really being told to simply burn their dead.  

Now, here is the grand implication of all of this.  From what I can find, there are ~500,000 living in King's Landing.  How many mummies are there in Kings Landing alone (let alone the rest of the south).  These aren't rickety skeletons.  These are well preserved bodies that are ready to rise up and fight.

Without waiting for an answer, Jaime went clinking down the dock, put a shoulder to the door, shoved it open . . . .

 . . . and found himself eye to eye with a loaded crossbow. Standing behind it was a chunky boy of fifteen. ""Lion, fish, or wolf?"" the lad demanded.

""We were hoping for a capon."" Jaime heard his companions entering behind him. ""The crossbow is a coward's weapon.""

""It'll put a bolt right through your heart all the same.""

""Perhaps. But before you can wind it up again my cousin here will spill your entrails on the floor.""

""Don't be scaring the lad, now."" Ser Cleos said.

""We mean no harm,"" the wench said. ""And we have coin to pay for food and drink."" She dug a silver piece from her pouch.

The boy looked suspiciously at the coin, and then at Jaime's manacles. ""Why's this one in irons?""

""Killed some crossbowmen,"" said Jaime. ""Do you have ale?""
-Storm of swords by George R. R. Martin (Pg 147-148)

Later on in the same chapter, the company is departing the Inn. Jaime remarks to the 15 year old crossbowman ""Take up the spear or maul, They'll serve you better."" 




This is one of my favorite chapters from Jaime's perspective. I find I enjoy his character a lot more than my friends who exclusively watch the show. I wonder if it's because you don't get to enjoy Jaime's wit in these situations in the show as much as you do in the books.

Crossbows are given sort of filthy tasks by GRRM. They have a role in the red wedding, Yoren's death, and are used by Joffrey in some key scenes. I'm under the impression George isn't fond of crossbows. ",11,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

But who wields Heartsbane is irrelevant, I was just thinking if the Hound will be eliminated from being a candidate for who wields Heartsbane and then it got me thinking, I don't think the Hound is going to survive.  But how is he going to die?

I thought about how King's Landing is very likely going to be used as a weapon/bomb against the AOTD and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Someone is going to need to light the fuse. The Hound *hates* fire (maybe that's why he hates gingers?) because of how Gregor pressed him up against the fire like a steak. The show repeatedly shows his fear for fire. How poetic would it be for the Hound to go out in the way that overcame his deepest fear and to become a hero? I mean after Cleganebowl, his brother would be dead and his hate will no longer fuel him to *need* to live.

And sure enough, I search around for evidence to back up this  before I clinged onto this idea and who else but Beric fucking Dundarrion implying the Hound going out in flames.

Beric Dondarrion sentences the Hound to trial by combat for abandoning the King's Guard. The Hound and Beric fight, to which the Hound cuts Beric down and Beric is killed.

After this, Arya, mad at the Hound killing Mycah, springs up with a knife and charges at the Hound, trying to kill him. Someone grabs Arya and:

&gt;Arya: *NO!* LET ME GO!

&gt;Hound: Looks like the god likes me more than your butcher's boy!

&gt;Arya: **BURN IN HELL!!**

&gt;Beric (arisen from the dead): **He will**.

A rough week for many of our bakers!

* Starting in the signature challenge, Daenerys was pushed for time and decided that dragon fire would be a faster way to bake her savory pies, but it ended up well over-baked.

* While Daenerys took her tins out of the oven with her bare hands, Jon managed to burn his hand in the oven, leaving him unable to complete his special ""Bastard Pie"" inspired by childhood memories.

* Although she managed to scrape by last week, Paul and Mary both deemed Arya's pies inedible due to the presence of human body parts.

* And unfortunately, we were informed that Walder had fallen ill and will be unable to continue in the competition.

* There were some bright spots, however. Paul and Mary were thoroughly impressed with Hot Pie's pies, and Cersei's ""Boozy Wildfire Cake"" won over Mary's heart and earned her Star Baker this week.

* Sadly, we had to say goodbye to Robert, who drank all his cooking wine, knocked his cake into the bin, and presented nothing to the judges.

After the season 7 finale will there ever be true politics in Season 8? 

Personally, the storylines involving politics were always when GOT was at its best. The magical element has always been there - be it the white walkers or the children of the forest. But now with the death of key political players like the Tywin, Queen of Thorns and Littlefinger, will season 8 lack the political game?

Yes we have Cersei and Dany and the battle for the crown but the squabbling families of Westeros and the small council have been put to a side. Varys was so underused last season and it would appear his storyline will now focus more on the magical element, Tyrion could very well be useful. Tyrells, Martels, the Freys etc etc have all gone - Valar Morghulis. 

Will Season 8 be let down by a repeat of battles with no substance behind them? Will we get more episodes like Beyond the Wall? How can we inject some much loved politics back into Westeros?",13,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I noticed the previously on included the  Sacrifice of Shereen which seemed like it was done in vain as Stannis was not victorious. 

Im wondering though if the sacrifice wasnt in vain.  That sacrifice is what granted Jon his seeming invincibility. All the arrows missed him and he survived many other close calls in the battle as well as ultimately being victorious with a lot of help from the Eyrie of course! 

I remember thinking it was a bit far fetched that Jon was able to come out of the battle unscathed even though he recklessly charged in against a volley of arrows. but this seems like a pretty reasonable solution to what seemed like a bit of a cliche good guy beating the bad guy.

Now how will this be done, well I believe the Council/Proto-Democratic approach to the ending and that the Iron Throne will possibly be melted down, Because lets just face it that thing has caused this mayhem I think its time it gets melted down and also I believe that the Starks will survive. There are a few people that think all the remaining Starks will die and while that is possible I dont think they will go extinct to be honest, I think the Starks will survive will the line survive..I dont know but I think we could see them survive then I think we could see the time of Wolves come so lets get started:

- Bran Stark: Now for Bran I dont know if he will rule by the end but if he does I will make this quick and simple he would rule Winterfell. No questions asked, A Brandon has always ruled WF (well most Starks named Brandon have ruled), and there must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

- Sansa Stark: Now Sansa there is a few ways this could go, For one she could become queen of the North if Bran chooses to decline it and if Jon ends up becoming the main ruler in the end (I dont think Bran will die) which I think is very possible since they have build up her being the Queen of the North for awhile and also it be satisfying in my eyes. Though another idea is for her to be Lady of the Vale, Now I would also mention her being Lady of Riverlands but I want to see Edmure take that responsibility (though it will probably be Roslin since Edmure may not even return next season, Sigh I just hope they are pulling a Jon Snow/The Hound on us like they did in S6), That and I believe Sansa knows more about the Vale since she was there for alittle while (longer in the books) though if that happens I think it be more of a book thing but to be honest I actually want to see Timett the Clansmen become Lord of the Vale if possible, There is a theory he may be the rightful ruler of the Vale and there is a vid on it by Alt Shift X go check it out its pretty good, and after watching it I kindof want to see Timett be Lord of the Vale by the end (but that is just a fav Crackpot theory of mine it will most likely be Robin or maybe it will be Sansa in the books and even in the show), However while this may not happen at this point in the show I still think it be very interesting if Sansa became queen of the Seven Kingdoms as she has learned a lot about ruling over the years, she deserves it after everything she has been through, and it parallel well with Queen Elizabeththe Virgin Queen (and yes I know she is not a virgin in the show but I like to pretend that never happenedsoyeah) but basically at this point she seems more likely to be either Queen of the North or Lady of the Vale.

- Arya Stark: Oh Arya out of the two stark sisters you are everyones favourite, Until Braavos in S5 &amp; 6 and Winterfell in S7 (if the theory of her testing Sansa does not turn out to be true in S8) but jokes aside Arya is most peoples Favourite character so obviously this one will be alittle important. In my mind there are really only three directions I can see Aryas storyline going at this point, Either A. She dies, B. she sails to lands more west, or C. she marries Gendry and becomes Lady of Storms end. Either of the three would fit her character but for this to work I am going to say as Leader of the Stormlands as Gendrys special lady. Now Arya has never been to Storms end or the Stormlands but neither has Gendry and they could still make good rulers, though another option if Sansa does not get it and if Jon does not want it or chooses not to have it would be Arya being queen of the Seven Kingdoms. This would be cool as it was secretly forshadowed through the series and it would fit in with the stories unpredictability, also like Sansa Arya has learned a lot about leadership arguably more so actually.

- Jon Snow: Now I was not going to mention him because for starter I am still split on weather or not he will live and two he is technically not a Stark, I of course classify him as a Stark AND a Targaryen but technically he is a Targaryen, But since he is a Stark at heart I will include him especially since out of the two I think Dany will die but Jon will live in some way, I think he will be King of the Seven Kingdoms but not just a simple king, I think he will end the usual rule of one ruler for all the kingdoms and have the throne melted down starting a council/Proto-Democratic Government of sorts (or atleast a Council with hints of a Proto-Democratic Government in the future) and there will be multiple Kings and Queens ruling the Seven Kingdoms to make it a better place. Jon seems fit for the job and I think he would take NOT because he wants to but because it will be his duty, and as much as it is very likely to happen I actually wouldnt mind it if instead Jon became some sort of king beyond where the wall use to be (notice how I say where the wall use to be).

So in conclusion I think it is possible the Time of Wolves could come and the Starks could rule a good amount of the Seven Kingdoms, Will it happen exactly like thatWell probably not, but it is still a very cool thought to think about. If this were to happen though I think it go like this: Bran rules the North, Sansa rules the Vale, Jon is king of the Seven Kingdoms in the Crownlands, and Arya is Lady of the Stormlands with Gendry as her Lord.",14,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

My list so far includes:

- Edmure Tully, Roslin his wife plus their baby / young child - any reason for us to go back to Riverrun?
- Quaithe - she will remain a mystery
- the few remaining Frey women - that plot line is ended
- Jaqen H'ghar - ditto, no more Faceless Men
- Meera Reed - sadly, I can't see the Reed family appearing again, except perhaps Howland in flashback
- Robin Arryn - maybe the Eyrie will become important, as it is the easiest to defend against invaders, but I can't see what would take us back to the Vale again
- Salladhor Saan - he has been absent for a couple of seasons, and there's no obvious reason to bring him back
- Aeron Greyjoy - I doubt we will go back to the Iron Islands
- Melessa Tarly - I'd like Sam to go back to Horn Hill, but I reckon his mother has passed away after learning of the deaths of her husband and younger son. Perhaps Sam's sister is there instead, to welcome him, Gilly and Little Sam to the ancestral home
- Kinvara - no obvious reason to return to Volantis
- Nymeria - that end was tidied up last season

I know it's unlikely, but I hope we see more of:

- the troupe of actors from Braavos - perhaps they crossed to Westeros with part of Dany's massive flotilla?
- Illyrio Mopatis - he was so important at the very beginning....

But I really hope we see Alys Karstark and Ned Umber again, repaying Jon's faith in them to be true to the Starks once more.

I reckon Syrio Forell died back in Season 1, but maybe D&amp;D will tease us somehow, with a mention of an old water dancer in a song or similar...

I think they are headed to Isle of Faces/The Riverlands as the WWs advance and as GC led by Euron hit them from the east.  There is so much thematic importance surrounding the Gods Eye, Harrenhal and the Ruby Fork of the Trident I just cannot fathom another place for the ultimate standoff to go down.

So, since they will want to keep the noncombatants safe, Riverrun is ideal, as is Bran being on the Isle of faces to plug in to wierwood.net.  What happens once he gets there is up for grabs; any ideas?  More Children of the Forest?  If so do they flood the Neck again taking out all their enemies at once?  Does the NK show Bran some crazy ass shit?  Does Bran sacrifice himself to end the war by taking over for the NK?  By killing himself?

In season 3 episode 3 of Game of Thrones, a miracle happens to Podrick Payne. Tyrion gave Podrick a gift at Littlefingers brothel for his loyalty at the Blackwater; a session with three of Littlefingers best prostitutes. Podrick returns from his gift and gives Tyrion back the money and when Tyrion protests Podrick replies that the prostitutes refused his money. After some questioning, its revealed that the money was not accepted because the virgin Podrick was so stunning in bed that the pleasure was worth more than the gold for the girls.  

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02QgSGH5mQA

&amp;nbsp;

This has become a legendary event in the show and in the fandom as well. Podrick has been hailed as the prophesized God of Tits and Wine Tyrion longed to meet, his member hypothesized to exceed even Tormunds, and given more titles than the King of Westeros for his noble deeds in bed. But, are those titles and accolades deserved? Is Podrick actually the Azor Ahai of sex come again? Im here to tell you no. Podrick is not the Lord of Orgasms, instead a pawn in the game of chess that is Kings Landing.

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing to keep in mind with the prostitutes refusal to take Tyrions money is the context of the episode this happens in. The episode, The Walk of Punishment, is after the Battle of Blackwater. Tyrion has been demoted from Hand of the King to Master of Coin by the returned Lord Tywin. The reason Tyrion, Bronn, and Podrick are at Littlefingers brothel is collecting the royal ledgers from the previous Master of Coin Petyr Baelish. We learn later in the episode that Littlefinger has been taking out enormous loans from Tywin Lannister but also, more importantly, the vicious Iron Bank of Braavos. As Tyrion unravels the ledgers more, he eventually learns that Littlefinger has been spending most of the Crowns money financing his own personal business ventures.

&amp;nbsp;

What this means is that Littlefinger, at this moment in the brothel, is handing over proof of his corruption and possible crimes against the Crown to Tyrion, one of the smartest people in Kings Landing. And he has to do it smiling knowing what enormous danger he is in if Tyrion  catches on to his schemes. What he needs is a spy that will tell him exactly how much Tyrion has uncovered so that Littlefinger can evade justice. However, Littlefinger has no insights into Tyrions inner circle at this moment. Now lets go back to the sequence of events with Podrick.

&amp;nbsp;

When Tyrion arrives, the first person he meets at Littlefingers brothel is Ros, the prostitute from Winterfell that Tyrion had so much fun with in the first season. She attempts at charming Tyrion then Pod and is rebuffed by both. With the context above with the danger Tyrion represents, having Ros front and center and working on Tyrion is a smart move from Littlefinger. Hes attempting a honey pot on Tyrion which is when you have one person feign sexual and/or romantic interest in another hoping they confide in your agent. Ros has a prior positive relationship with Tyrion and is an ideal candidate for this. 

&amp;nbsp;

The initial honey pot fails but Ros interest in Podrick as well is telling with what happens next. With this is mind, lets look at the dialogue in the scene.

&gt;They wouldnt take it my Lord - Podrick

&gt;Maybe they were trying to curry some favor with the new master of coin - Bronn

&gt;Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? Theyre happy enough to take it when I give it to them. - Tyrion

&gt;What did you tell them?  - Bronn

&gt;I didnt tell them anything  Podrick

&gt;What did you do to them - Tyrion
 
&gt;Lots of things  Podrick

&gt;And they seemed to like these things? - Tyrion

&gt;Yes mlord  Podrick

&gt;Of course they seemed to like it, theyre paid to seem to like it  - Bronn

&gt;Only they werent paid - Tyrion

&gt;What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much he gave them the time for free?  - Bronn

&amp;nbsp;

What we should be doing in this scene is listening to Bronn, he is rightfully skeptical of Podricks story. He guesses that the prostitutes were faking in an effort to get at Tyrion somehow. Then he asks if they pumped Pod for information. And finally notes that great prostitutes are actresses, they can fake pleasure easily. Bronn correctly identifies that even though Pod is only a squire, being a squire to Tyrion makes him valuable. If the girls can get Podrick to come back more and more, perhaps in between wine and pillow talk, they can get useful information for Littlefinger. Even innocuous details such as Tyrions mood or when he calls it a day as he begins analyzing the ledgers would be useful information. 

Tyrion on the other hand is ready to believe the girls were genuinely overwhelmed by Podricks prowess almost instantly. He claims that because they didnt take HIS gold they didnt get paid at all. Hes overlooking that Littlefinger can pay his girls himself out of his own pocket in gold, favors, or advancement in his organization. Its like if you get a dinner on the house at a restaurant. The staff working on your meal are still getting paid just by the owner instead of by you. Same concept here that Tyrion doesnt even consider.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, Tyrion is horribly biased in this exchange because he deeply wants to believe that prostitutes arent motivated only by money. His first relationship with Tysha (which tragically is revealed as genuine) was one where Tyrion believed she loved him and he was told she was only a prostitute hired by Jaime. And also with Shae there is that same tension as Tyrion struggles with how much Shae actually cares for him. The things he is saying about Podricks encounter are the things Tyrion tells himself constantly when he doubts Shae. Bronn, bereft of that internal conflict, sees the easy truth immediately that Podrick is being set up somehow.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion also dismisses that the prostitutes were faking because Podrick claims he didnt say anything about his life or Tyrion. He shows this as evidence that they werent interested in anything Podrick knows. However, there is an easy long game in Podrick believe he is amazing at sex and then, more importantly, spreading that rumor around. In the next episode Kissed by Fire Ros and Varys meet and Ros tells the Spider about Tyrion and Podrick. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVDsWL7gahs

&amp;nbsp;

The story being told is that Podrick is extraordinary yet not in any specific way. Ros even notes how odd it is that the normally descriptive girls have no details. Later we see the rumors about Pod spreading. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1xXdjMk8fU

&amp;nbsp;

Random women are giggling appreciatively at  Podrick as he runs by, when before he was invisible and looked down on. The long game here is less obvious, however it is planting the idea in Podricks mind that now strangers are rightly interested in him sexually. He previously would be suspicious of advances given his low social standing and average looks, and is also suspicious of Littlefingers girls. Now that he knows he has a reputation, the interest seems justified. What Littlefinger could now do is send one of his employees in disguise as a chance encounter and have Pod believe they are genuinely interested in him. That sounds convoluted though right? Not when you consider Littlefinger does this exact thing to Loras Tyrell with Olyvar.

&amp;nbsp;

Littlefinger sends his male prostitute Olyvar to pose as a squire for Loras Tyrell and seduces the Knight of Flowers. From then on, Littlefinger has a constant source of information inside the Tyrells that he exploits. Olyvar even becomes privy to conversations between Loras and Margaery. Part of the reason this works is that Loras believes it is reasonable that Olyvar would be attracted to him, so he does not question the chance encounter and then becomes taken in by Olyvars act. With Podricks sexual prowess buoying his self image, he too may be caught in a similar web.

&amp;nbsp;

Why this plan doesnt work on Podrick is revealed in season 4. Podrick has been burying his nose in books instead which he shows off by naming the banners of the Dornish houses as they arrive for Joffreys wedding. Tyrion is one the few lords that encourages their squires to learn and actively teaches the boy. Pods work ethic and duties as a squire has rendered him unavailable for a continuation of the honey pot strategy. In the end it was a gamble from Littlefinger that failed, but not a high cost. Tyrion never realized what was happening and all it cost Littlefinger was a small pouch of gold. 

&amp;nbsp;

Its clever writing and planning by the show writers that despite Tyrions self-professed prowess at playing the Game of Thrones, he has a very large blindspot that can be exploited. There are games being played even above Tyrions head and hes nowhere near in control as he thinks. Also the callback from Loras and Olyvar allows the viewer to go back and see this scene, which was played for comedic effect, and re-evaluate what is happening under Tyrions nose. Tyrion is in far more danger and scrutiny from Littlefinger than he ever realized. And that the hole in his heart left by Tysha is where Tyrion is the most vulnerable. 

&amp;nbsp;

And that is the mystery of what Podrick did in that brothel: nothing special. Just another pawn being moved around the board by the real players in Kings Landing. 

###TL:DR Littlefinger tried to honey pot Podrick to gain an unwitting spy on Tyrion who recently took over as Master of Coin

I am not necessarily going to cling to any 1 specific theory, but rather introduce a few ideas that are good strong possibilities. These ideas represent the possible filling in of Key information that we have not been told by GRRM as of yet. Also a lot of these ideas are borrowed and tweaked from other analysts.

The others in the novels remain 1 of the biggest mysteries in the series, if not the most important mystery of all. They are at the head of the story in a sense that they are the primary antagonists or threat to our favorite characters. They represent the biggest conflict of our tale: the clashing of Ice with Fire. They give the story a sense of impending doom and urgency, and yet we dont know why exactly, or even how to stop them. This definitely keeps us on the edge of our seat. GRRM rarely writes about them, but gives us several clues about their nature and behavior from other sources and characters, such as Melisandre, but also a lot of their symbolism and mythology can be learned from the Kingsguard, not just that they are in a sense, soldiers, they work as a group, they have leadership, but also they have an aura about them, one that demands respect.

Their origin is a very important part of understanding who they are and what they want. We have been denied an actual origin story thus far but, GRRM has given us some bread crumbs that lead us in a general direction of thought. The story of the Nights King and his corpse like bride, is probably the most obvious reference to the origin of the others exceptthe timing is all wrong. They Nights King was said to have been the 13th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch meaning that the NW, the Long Night and thus the Others had to of pre-existed. Now that could mean that the timeline we were given was purposefully incorrect, but then why would the author even bother? What is the point of giving us just that singe piece of character defining info if it is incorrect? Certainly if GRRM wanted to give us incorrect info he would hide it in several other facts, but yet this is really the only piece of info we have to figure out who the Nights King was. Assuming that info must be correct, then what is the purpose of the NK story if not to tell us the origin of the others? What I suggest is that, the mating of the NK and his corpse like bride was the 1st time that a human and other produced a child together. Thus created the first group of White Walkers aka Hybrids, half breeds, mergers of the human genome with that of the others.

In that respect White Walkers are more human like than the Others, and would have some remaining link to humanity in them. Therefore they might even sympathize with humans and have some measure of understanding. Where as the Others were the original ice beings, and were seemingly all but destroyed during the 1st long night save for maybe a few including the Corpse like queen that either hypnotized or fell in love with the Nights King.

So that explains White Walkers but what about their ancestors the original Others, where did they come from if not born on Westeros? To answer that we need to look to the TV show which tells us of a different but perhaps similar origin: The WWs are a result of Dragonglass; those magical chunks of frozen fire. Now granted, in the TV show Dragonglass is mined from caves but the show tends to simplify and downplay the heavy fiction, fantasy elements of the novels, in favor of more realistic and practical choices. In the book, Maester Luwin says that Dragonglass came from the fires below the world, but Maesters are notorious for telling lies about all things magical. What I suggest is that Dragonglass is Not a naturally occurring element of their planet. Now considering its name we could guess that maybe its origins are the same as dragons in that it came from volcanoes? However, there is a rather peculiar back-story from Qarth about how the moon got too close to the sun and shattered spilling out multitudes of dragons. Now you could just chalk this up to the characters being ignorant and superstitious or you could see it as a clue that something dragon like did come from the sky. Dragonglass is often shown to be spear headed or pointy in nature; well wouldnt that make sense if it had been splintered off like a shard of glass shooting through outer space? GRRM provides us with other clues that reference the sun and moon story such as the name of the seat and the sigil of house Martell which portrays a spear of the sun. This idea of the sun having a spear or using a spear could easily provide the evidence of how flame destroyed a moon and the pieces rained down like dragons with flaming tails. In the Martel sigil the sun figure is red, but could it possibly be referring to a red star instead? A big red burning star that when shattered would look like it was bleeding? Bleeding giant pieces of flaming red rock / stone? Flaming red pointy stone that looks like dragons, yet when lands, cools off it turns black. What else do we know that looks red when hot and black when not? Perhaps when a blacksmith makes a sword, such as widows wail, or when a Targaryen changes his banners, a Blackfyre? Or shadow fire? Could this all be a metaphor for the suns effect on a moon/planet that when in the glow of the hot sun appears red, but when in the shadow turns black as night and cold as winter? Or could there be two moons, 1 red and 1 black; the red responsible for all fire magic of the series and the black responsible for the Others and wights.

Indeed, its all about the suns influence and favor. Dragonglass is the suns own fire (seed) shot through the moons core (heart) and the result is a multitude of fire trapped inside frozen moon fragments.

Now that we have established that Dragonglass, or even the alternate black greasy / oily stone that was first mentioned in a clash of kings chapter 26, could have other worldly origins, it is not hard to see the similarities between these stones and the Others. The Blackstone described in the aforementioned chapter is exactly the same description of the stone that the Bloodstone emperor worshipped and formed a religion around; a religion aptly named the church of starry wisdom. Now this blackstone is different from Dragonglass yet it must possess some type of magical if not hypnotic properties if it could influence people to worship it. Scholars even claim that the worship of this stone caused the emperor to kill his sister and thus caused the long night. This also explains how the WWs have the ability to raise the dead, as the Emperor was known to practice Necromancy and other dark arts. Could this stone have come from a cold moon/ planet? By worshiping this stone and practicing dark arts, could he have performed a ritual that caused a solar eclipse or possibly even a meteor shower? Or to take it 1 step further, an invitation for an other-worldly race to descend to his planet?

Or could it be possible that such beings crash landed on Westeros, and the impact of their landing along with other giant chunks of their home world, caused so much debris and dust to fill up the sky and block out the sun for an extended period of time? With that notion it seems that what we have been lead to believe was a medieval fantasy story was really just a clever disguise for a sci- fi thriller. This is after all a GRRM story and what would that be without some type of alien invasion or deviant sub species?",20,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Before making your choice, I want to provide more detail to both of these options: 

Option 1: We will get The Winds of Winter, but we'll never see A Dream of Spring. In this scenario, we're going to say that GRRM will release Winds within the next year or two (maybe after Season 8 finishes airing?). He'll continue to work on Dream, but he'll either die or become too physically incapable of finishing the series, so we will never get the conclusion to the books. The biggest pro here is obvious - getting more story. GRRM has said a few times that we'll get more details about The Others in Winds, so even though we wouldn't see the end of the series from George, we would still get more of his vision and it would be easier to theorize where he wanted the end to go if we had an entirely new book. The biggest con is also obvious - we would get that close to the end, but we wouldn't see it. We'll still get the ending of the series through the TV show, but it's obviously going to be a simplified version of what is coming in the books, so it would be awful to get that close to George's ending only to not get it. 

Option 2: GRRM actually admits that the series will never be finished, and we never get another book. In this scenario, he might not be finishing for a number of reasons (He just doesn't want to, he can't figure out how to end it, etc) but the biggest thing here is that GRRM actually tells us that he won't finish, so we don't have to keep waiting and wondering. So the major pro here is that we get some sort of closure - even though we don't get the end of the series, we get GRRM actually admitting that he can't/won't finish the series and we can finally just let it go.

In making Gendry the ""winner"" of this bittersweet ending, it would be paying respect to the lore of the show (it isn't exactly a random, out of the blue or unbelievable ending), as well as sticking to GRRM's subversion of peoples expectations.

Spoilers season 7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/89pb75/spoilers_trying_to_understand_the_family_trees/,gottafly65,1522847456,"So many questions...

In an early season Ned told Jon Snow that when he returned he would tell him about his mother. Okay, so now we know that Ned knew who Jon Snows real mother was. We also know that he knew Jon Snows real name was Aegon Targaryen. I don't remember if he knew about the secret wedding between Rhaegar and Lyanna - but, if he did that means he knew that Jon was the rightful heir to the throne and yet he let Robert Baratheon take the throne and let Jon go to the wall where he would have to swear off ever holding a throne. Did Ned know this? or did he not know about the wedding and think Jon was still a bastard anyway.

The throne loophole. So, apparently since Jon has died he is released from his oath to guard the wall. Since it was a ""rest of my life / till I die"" type pledge and well... he died. So, he has left the wall and been proclaimed King of the North. Interesting that the people in the north were okay with him breaking his vows since most of them do not know that he has died. Also, if he did try and take the iron throne would there be someone trying to say ""he can't do that because he swore his life to guard the wall..."" at which time he would either have to step down OR he would have to admit he died (which he seems to guard for fear people would see him as crazy).

Someone mentioned that since Jon is a Targaryen he would likely be able to ride dragons and walk through fire. However, when Daenerys brother Viserys was killed by the molten gold Daenerys said ""he must not have dragon blood in him"" or something like that - which implied that maybe he was not truly in her bloodline. I don't see how Viserys could die from fire and people would think Jon would not.

disclaimer: yes, I know it is a fantasy movie and if you are willing to accept the dead walking and dragons flying you should probably accept the bloodline questions as insignificant... just curious as I wait for Season 8.

What could season 8 possibly have in store that would make us all cry? To try to answer this question, we will revisit the main clues GRRM and D&amp;D have left us in the show in order to predict the ending.
___
___
___
**Littlefinger, the Death Cheater**
-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLletjWIew&amp;index=1&amp;list=LLLvVbybZLTTxqmNjm-KZh7g : credit to Neos channel for perfectly explaining how Baelish made us all believe he was miserably defeated in s07e07. 
When in reality, he let the faceless woman to whom he gave an iron coin (s07e05) die in his place while wearing a mask of his face (as it is possible to wear the face of a living person without having necessarily skinned him:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljFljgf2USk&amp;t=126s ). 
____
Littlefinger is the song of Ice &amp; Fire: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dz80BjU0wE&amp;t=292s (4:52 - 5:26) &amp; 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dz80BjU0wE&amp;t=942s (15:42 - 15:50). 

He has been involved in every major event in the last 30 years of GoT history: Robert Rebellion (he spread the rumor that Lyanna was abducted and raped roughly 1 year after being defeated by Brandon Stark), Starks and Lannisters, Joeffrey's poisoning, etc., etc.
___
For all the bad writing D&amp;D are capable of, they still take their lead from Martin when it comes to the ending of major plotlines. And even they are not stupid enough to have given us 5 out of 7 episodes in season 7 where every single character/peasant and their mother were yelling at Littlefinger that they had 0 trust in him and wanted him dead.   
___
Look at the interview Aidan Gillen gave to the LA Times: *""I dont think Baelish does crocodile tears. I dont think Baelish likes to shed tears, certainly not in front of people. If we saw some emotion, I dont really think it was sentimental. I think it was involuntary: Your time is up.""* http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-game-of-thrones-littlefinger-petyr-baelish-20170828-htmlstory.html
___
And what do we see in episode 7? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=2704s  (45:04  49:42)
The exact things Peter would never do: running around, begging for mercy and for his life while shedding tears large enough to make your baby jealous. 
___
Now compare that performance to other instances where Baelish has been physically in danger or on the verge of death:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SczY9E4UbBM&amp;t=385s (6:25 - 6:48)

Every single time, calculate and impeccable control. As you would expect from a man that has been plotting for 30 years straight without a rest. Such a man will not be taken by surprise when the end comes. But a faceless man playing the last moments of this man would think he would be...

Who says that?? What kind of answer is that? What secrets could you possibly be taking to your grave Gillen if this was the last we were ever going to hear from Littlefinger? Its just an acting gig, not a sect! Unless

**The Fate of Arya Stark**
-

One of the dumbest and most uncharacteristic plotlines of season 7 was Littlefinger trying to exploit the tension between the Stark girls in the hope of turning Sansa against Arya from episode 5 to 7. 
___
Look how unusual and unfamiliar Aidan Gillen acting is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=2145s (35:45  37:40) &amp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=2462s (41:02  43:28)
Baelishs train of thoughts is less cunning and his attempts at manipulating Sansa blunt and straightforward, almost as if he was on autopilot, almost as if he was another person
___
Now, why would Baelish ever want Arya dead? Because he was afraid of her skills as an assassin or afraid of the possibility she might kill him in the future? 
___
Getting rid of Arya would not amount to anything for Peter as Bran and his knowledge are still around. Even Sansa would end up figuring things out at some point. Baelish is not Joffrey. Hes not the type of person to plot the execution of people that dislike him or have the physical aptitude to eventually kill him; otherwise, hed be plotting the execution of 95% of the people he has ever encountered. This doesnt add up because the answer is he doesnt.
___
Littlefinger doesnt care about the fate of Arya Stark but the Faceless Men do. By this time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=1760s (29:20), the mastermind had already fled and been replaced by his faceless man body double who started pushing forward her own clumsy scheming agenda.
___
And so, the dumb plotline turns into a very cohesive one.
___
Arya was allowed to leave the cult of the faceless men after the debt of life she owed to the many faced god was paid with the death of the waif instead of Lady Cranes.
But after her departure, she went straight back to her obsessive list of names and went on to eradicate all the Freys using the faces of a servant and of Walder Frey.
___
By doing so, a girl stole from the many faced god. These mens lives werent hers to take, at least not by abusing the magic of the faceless men. And we know what of a bunch of extreme fanatics the faceless men are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljFljgf2USk&amp;t=38s (00:38  1:10) &amp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljFljgf2USk&amp;t=95s (1:35  2:10)  *Now a debt is owed and only death can pay for life*, Arya Starks death.
___
As Jaqen H'ghar said: *The faces are for no one, you are still someone. And to someone, the faces are as good as poison*. In this case, the faceless men are the poison that has come as far as Winterfell to take her life in exchange for those she stole from the many faced god.

___
Being present at the execution of her father and at the murder of her mother and brother at such a young age (red wedding) has traumatized her. Her pursuit of bringing death to the people she hated has consumed her. And her time with the faceless men as altered her mental even more (their training consists mostly on a self-inflicted brainwashing and feelings stripping). But in exchange, she gained a lot of strength.
___
This strength has made her become overly confident. Its almost as if she now believes the power she has obtained allows her to get away with doing anything or assassinating anyone without any repercussions:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=1331s  (22:11  25:00 &amp;) Look at the constant smug on her face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=1610s (26:50  27:12)
___
Obviously, the plot to trick Sansa into getting rid of Arya failed when the faceless women playing Littlefinger died at the hands of Arya by the end of season 7. But there are more faceless men to come and contrary to the time when the waif attacked, this time, Aryas guard is down.

Cue the young actress around Arya's age they cast in November to play in a Dave Nutter episode (most likely 1 or 2), which will be a faceless woman sent to kill Arya: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwF5J3moJ0A&amp;t=77s (1:17 - 1:52).
___
There will be consequences to Arya turning into a killer. And the Faceless Men are a relentless and skilled bunch. With her death, the Valeryan steel dagger will be picked up by Jon as something to remember Arya's spirit by.

**A Fight between Good vs. Evil?**
-

What have D&amp;D been trying to convince us of for the past 2 seasons? That in the end, this show is about the fight between a gathering of good guys (Jon Snow/Daenerys &amp; Co., aka Strong/Just/Good looking/Anything else cool you can think of) and the big villain (Night King and White Walkers, ugly and so bluntly evil that they cant even talk, forged with one sole purpose by the children of the forest: to end life).
___
Most people think this is the direction the show has taken and have been disappointed or unimpressed by this development. This means the show runners have done a fantastic job at adapting the novel series as almost nobody is doubting the path it is taking.
___
But if you think this story leads up to someone defeating the Night King and the Wights, you havent been paying attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIva5LzhPFE&amp;t=1616s (26:56  27:19);
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIva5LzhPFE&amp;t=1953s (32:33  32:40) *If everybody thinks your character is a hero or if everybody thinks your character is a villain, then you are writing cardboards.*
___
And let's be real, at this point, everybody thinks the Night King is the braindead (literally) villain and Jon &amp; Co. are the ultimate gathering of the good guys. So are D&amp;D writing cardboards to end the story? Of course not! GRR Martin would never have let that happen.
___
What is the most important message George will want to get across the entirety of this series?
___
To understand that, you need to look at the event that has most shaped GRRM as a young adult: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIva5LzhPFE&amp;t=374s (6:14  8:30)  *Before researching the Vietnam War, I just thought that we were in another war and we were helping poor people defend themselves against evil communist aggression. And then I actually researched the war, [] suddenly, it did not look at all so clear cut to me.* 
___
George has been repeatedly illustrating this idea at every chance he gets in the series: very few confrontations between people are as black and white as we would like to believe. Both parties are always motivated by strong convictions (whether itd be reasoning/law/ideal/faith/love/honor or survival). Once these convictions are strong enough, they act as a veil that allows one to justify any action (even it being taking the life of another person in the name of such a cause). But if you take time to understand both parties motivations from their perspective; oftentimes, it becomes very difficult to point out the good guy from the bad guy (in real history as well).  
___
Its a point of view that is easy to grasp when you look at fights such as the battle of the Wall between the Men of the Watch and Mance Rayder wildling army. Our heroes, Jon, Sam &amp; Co. need to protect Westeros and their lands from Northern invaders while the ever likable and charismatic Mance needs to fight the Nights watch in order to go south or all wildlings will die by the hands of the Whitewalkers. Hard to root for any specific side in a battle between these too, isnt it?
___
But what happens when the 2 parties are: 1) the army of the dead (Night King &amp; the Whitewalkers) and 2) the alliance of the living (Jon Snow &amp; Co.)? Surely, against this kind of pure evil, such thinking cannot be applied, right?
___

**The White Walkers: An unheard voice**
-

Youve been told by the children of the forest, ancient tales and various manuscripts that the White Walkers are a weapon of mass destruction and are here to kill all of the living and you have seen with your own eyes the mass murder they afflicted upon the wildlings at Hardhome. But has anyone in Westeros taken the time to thoroughly  think through how they operate and clarify what their goal is?
___
Is the Night Kings goal really to wipe out all form of life in the world? Does he have any conscience at all?
___
We need to look at what we have seen so far from the White walkers to try to answer this question:
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=845s (14:05  15:00)  A White Walker looks into the unharmful and fearful eyes of Sam and does to not kill him but rather keeps on marching south. 
This shows that there is some degree of free will in the Whitewalkers (or in the Night King, since he is most likely controlling them) or at least, that they can refrain from killing anyone alive (probably as long as they do not express any harmful intention towards them).
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=1028s (17:08  17:40) Wights however, attack anyone without hesitation. These are mere tools, animated and controlled by the power of the White Walkers and solely programmed to attack on sight. Wights have no conscience. 
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=1645s (27:35  28:52) Further proof that White Walkers are capable of not killing every human life they see: e.g. Crestor and the babies that the Night King intends to turn into White Walkers.
___
So these scenes let us know that: 1) White Walkers are capable of sparing human life, 2) their sole purpose is not to kill any living form on sight and 3) they are marching towards a goal, something or someone that is south of the Wall.
___
Then around s06e05, the White Walkers are gathered as they intend to march South. But once the Night King sees Bran looking at them, he marks him and all the Whites go back North to kill this kid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do2M5V3mlak&amp;t=687s (11:27  12:17). 
___
Now, why would killing Bran be so important to the Night King that hed specifically mark him and turn around his entire army for just one mans life? Is it because he sees the strong potential in Bran and needs to get rid of him before his powers grow too much? The answer is no.
___

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UsSH1E01LM (3:55  5:37) Benjen Stark *The children found me. They stopped the walkers magic from taking hold the same way they made the walkers in the first place*  
___
Through Benjen, we learn that it is possible for a host in which the children of the forest have plunged dragon glass to still have most of his conscience. So when that dragon glass is plunged into a host, the children can control how much of his former self and his awareness they choose to leave in that body. In the case of the Night King, being in the middle of a violent war, the children tuned the awareness down to a minimum to make him as much of an inhuman killing machine as they could. However, what they didnt account for, was for Brans spirit to be in that body at that time, high jacking the process and resulting in a failure to turn this body into a simple weapon
___
What if a shred of his former human conscience remained in the Night King?  What if the strongest will of the former owner of the body remained in this killing machine? Being at war with the Children, the man strongest will would have been to kill the Children of the forest. Hence the Night King turning against its creators.
But in the Night Kings body is trapped another spirit, Brans spirit. And what is Bran single everlasting conviction: to protect life. Once the Children of the forest started going extinct (against a combination of White Walkers, the Andals &amp; the Night King), only Brans will remained in that body.
___
And what could the remaining pieces of Bran spirit do with a body that can only do one thing, killing? How do you protect life when you know the only thing you can do is bring death and when you know that no one has the power to stop you from inflicting it?
___
The answer is by killing. Killing and destroying is the only tool and form of free will at the disposal of the Night King in his current state of existence.
___
Destroying the source of magic that keeps him bound to the curse: the main Heart tree at the Isles of Faces that is at the center of all Weirwood trees in Westeros (similar to this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do2M5V3mlak&amp;t=473s  ""7:53  7:55"") and killing himself by killing Bran.
___
This is why the army of the dead completely turns around and goes back North when the Night King marks Bran. Because killing Bran is the priority. This is why the White Walkers have been specifically trying to march south past the Wall and this is why they had been trying to communicate their intentions to whoever could see by forming symbols on the ground using the only pen they could, dead bodies:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=153s (2:33  3:05) A 2D drawing of the weirwood Heart tree at the Isle of faces (as well as a Whight can draw with dead body parts); the circle represents the isle and the line in the middle is the Heart tree (the part of the line going above the circle designates the trunk above the surface and the part of the line under the circle is the root of the weirwood tree).

You can see it even more clearly here under the drawings of the 3 men: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=199&amp;v=LJnMJc6Xgs0&amp;t=182s (3:02);

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=1128s (18:48  19:15) Whirlwind paintings referring to the Heart tree in the Isle of Faces.
___
Had they known, all Westerosi people had to do was let the Night King and the White Walkers pass through. 
___
As a result, who would be the villain in this scenario? Is it the Night King and the Whitewalkers that killed tens of thousands so they could stop themselves from endlessly killing life? Or is it Jon/Bran &amp; Co. that sent tens of thousands to their death instead of stepping aside like Sam did in his first encounter with a White Walker?
___
One thing is for certain, knowledge would have been their true savior. Even with the most unlikely kind of people or thing, there may be common ground. In this case, both the Night King &amp; Jon Snow were fighting for the same cause without realizing it: to protect the living. *Make sure to think things through before you act.*
___
In the end, knowledge is power. 
*(does this remind you of anyone?)*

**Why does the Night King need newborn babies to turn into White Walkers?**
-

The Night King is the same man we saw in the origin story with the addition of Bran spirit being trapped inside of him, turned by the Children of the forest into a killing machine. The only semblance of free will he has in this state of existence is: 1) killing humans and animals 2) expanding his army of the dead and 3) to be fair, probably also being able to move in whichever direction he chooses and some other small things like drawing with dead bodies to a certain extent, etc.
___
To expand his army, this Night King chooses newborn babies.
___
Now why would the Night King specifically need to use babies to create walkers? I would assume turning babies into Whitewalkers means he has to wait at least 15-20 years before he can realistically cash back on an adult Whitewalker? Why not simply use any strong adult warrior captured among the wildling ranks? 
___
The answer is because a new born baby does not have time to form any strong conviction or thought. Which means when the Night King turns the baby into a Whitewalker, he will transform into his complete puppet without any chance of it having any shred of strong conviction/motivation. Because a newborn baby never had time to experience much thought. Bran, aka the Night King, needs his Whitewalkers to be completely obedient to his will, contrary to what happened when the Children of the forest created him. So that there is no chance of the Night King ever turning a psychotic human adult filled with hatred for other human beings into a Whitewalker that could disobey his will and attack humans that would not present a threat.

**The Lion vs The Kraken &amp; The Dragon**
-
In season 8, we will be introduced to the Golden Company, which Euron is bringing to King's Landing to support the Lannisters. By this time, Euron has proven himself a ""faithful"" servant to the Iron Crown.
___
While he is traveling, Cersei has a miscarriage and loses her unborn child. Like the Valonqar prophecy stated, she will drown in her tears. Having lost every person she has ever cared for, Cersei agrees to proceed with marrying Euron (which is also a little brother). And to pay homage to the Iron Born custom, she agrees to be reborn by ""drowning"" in the ocean.
___
In the meantime, Theon plots the rescue of Yara and fails miserably, resulting in both of their deaths. After this regrettable event, Euron is crowned King and marries Cersei. 
___
Now remember what Euron's sigil is? It's a silver Kraken above a glaring red eye. The red eye symbolizes Bloodraven, aka Three Eyed Raven (=TER), aka Brynden Rivers, aka the most dedicated defender of the Targaryen reign ever. The TER had helped Euron awaken his powers and had taught him how to use them in exchange for helping Daenerys reclaim the Iron Throne. Bloodraven made Euron believe he intended on having him sit on the Iron Throne by Dany's side. But what he had always planned was to crown Jon king with Dany by his side.
___
So on their wedding night, Euron distracts the Mountain. While in bed with Cersei, he tries to murder her. With Cersei's death, Euron would have become the ruler of the 7 Kingdoms. Then, he would have convinced Dany to marry him instead of fighting (which he could have done thanks to the big Dragon controlling horn he had acquired if she had not fallen in love with Snow).
___
It was the perfect scenario for the TER. Except Euron had been fooling Brynden Rivers all along. He had never intended on sitting Daenerys on the Iron Throne. Euron is "" the storm - the first storm, and the last"". *(more on that in part 2)*
___
A dashing young man covered in Black &amp; Red saves the Queen and executes the Greyjoy, putting an end to whichever scheme Euron had been building up to. This soldier from the Golden Company is Aegon Targaryen (Elia Martell &amp; Rhaegar Targaryen's first born son, that Varys had smuggled from death and raised among Blackfyres). With their leader's death, the Iron Born's fleet dismantles and scatters throughout the sea.
___
*P.S. Aegon Targaryen being Elia's son that had been miraculously saved by Varys from the hands of the Mountain is a show related idea. In the books however, Aegon Targaryen is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen &amp; Lyanna Stark. And Jon Snow is really the King in the North, the rightful heir to Winterfell, the Sword of the Morning, the wielder of the true Lightbringer, Dawn, and the first son of Ned Stark &amp; Ashara Dayne. While Mance Rayder is really Arthur Dayne, Jon's uncle working as hard as he can to make Jon look like he has plot armor North of the Wall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ti6z8KL44g&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLQrZpjVj947iED_JCrqwGFW1VkchOnl1f.* 

*Merging these two characters into Jon Snow was a poor choice from D&amp;D. It created a ton of plotholes and forced us into another incestuous relationship between Jon &amp; Dany that should never have happened, had Jon been the result of Ned's first marriage with Ashara.*
___
Varys's real intentions were never to get rid of the Targaryens and have Blackfyres sit on the Iron Throne like his ancestors wanted. Nor was it to devote himself to the well-being of the small people like he had claimed so often. Varys had seen what internal conflict had done to their family and was sick of it. This is why he had worked his entire life to bring together the whole Targaryen family (Blackfyres + Targaryens). His raising Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia + Rhaegar/ rightful heir) among Blackfyres, was the perfect opportunity for Varys to forge a good King for the Iron Throne. A man with a strong name, raised with knowledge and empathy, that would one day close the rift once formed between Blackfyres and Targaryens. Aegon/""Young Griff"" could have healed the realm back to its former glory and to its former peace. Like it had once been before the civil rebellions.

*Ironically, Bloodraven/Brynden Rivers, stuck in his old ways and convinced that Balckfyres could never be trusted, had been fighting Varys as the Three Eyed Raven all along, since the day he ordered Varys's genitals burnt. In the end, Bloodraven had wasted most of his energy fighting the one man that was putting his soul out to help this family stopping from killing each other. Once again, knowledge would have been power.*
___
___
Back in the North, Tyrion reunites with Jaime and is desperate to understand how Cersei managed to outmaneuver him. To prove his good faith, Jaime lets Daenerys know the spy master, Varys, had betrayed them and was the one leaking battle plans to Cersei &amp; Euron in season 7. You didn't think Jaime, Euron or Cersei would outmaneuver Tyrion without some serious insider help, didn't you? In this case, Tyrion misplaced trust in Varys was the reason for his failure.
___
Faithful to her word, Daenerys burns Varys alive after he gets exposed. But Varys's lifetime sacrifice had not been in vein, as his protege, Aegon Targaryen, was as close as any Blackfyre had ever been to the Iron Throne.
___
Varys had to leak Tyrion's plans to Cersei for Dany's overwhelming army to be reduced to a more manageable size in case she were to become a threat to Aegon (for whom the Golden Company fights). At first, Varys still supported Dany as she was the perfect person to weaken the stability and strength of the Crown at the time. And he was hoping to have her marry Aegon and see them both reign from the Iron Throne. But when Dany fell in love with Jon Snow, Varys's plans at any marital alliance fell into pieces and the only way Aegon would rule would have to be by fully supporting Cersei &amp; defeating Daenerys's army (aka the Foreign Invader). Then getting rid of Cersei (aka the Mad Queen), thus presenting Aegon Targaryen as the savior of the realm and the rightful ruler of the 7 Kingdoms.

**Azor Ahai**
-

One of the most debated subjects in GoT is the person that will turn out to be Azor Ahai. Is it Jon? Is it Danny? Is it Euron? Is it GRRM? Who is it?
___
Azor Ahai is the man that has the smartest and most magnetizing dialogues in the entire series, the man that has been singing the song of Ice &amp; Fire for 30 years: Peter *Littlefinger* Baelish himself.
___
But it just isn't as literal as you would think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNPCGcfcBbA&amp;t=396s , GRRM: *""The prophecies must be taken with a grain of salt. I am amused to see fans argue over the true identity of a character that is a legend, when you have to know how to read between the lines and distinguish the facts from the speculation.""*
___
Littlefinger will be the savior of King's Landing. But not the savior from the army of the dead. He is no fool to ever get into stabbing range of the Night King. Given how much power the Night King has, given how little Peter knows about him (would stabbing the Night King with the Valyrian steel dagger even kill him? we don't even know for sure and so does Littlefinger) and given that Baelish knows he is not a warrior, it would be very uncharacteristic of him to be anywhere near the Night King any time soon. He is a betting man indeed, but not one to act without knowledge. And there are very few things he could possibly know regarding the Night King.
___
But do you know who can certainly be killed by a weapon? Daenerys Targaryen. 
___
___
___
**The fate of Daenerys Targaryen**
-

Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons *(I am running out of breath here)*, has a good heart and has suffered and overcome an heroic and extreme journey.  But she has also repeatedly demonstrated that she was a terrible politician and has had tendencies to resort to extremism when she felt cornered. It doesn't help that she has weapons of mass destruction at her side (dragons), making her every will almost unstoppable. 
___
Daenerys is a bad ruler: she burnt most of the things she encountered south of the narrow sea and left Meereen in complete chaos to be ruled by Daario Naharis, a mercenary who never expressed any interest in politics. And after one final round of burning stuff around in Meeren, she left (thank god for D&amp;D not keeping us to date with Meeren, cause by now, it must have become a tragic mess). The only decent political choices she ever made happened the few times she managed to listen to the advice of Jorah or Tyrion.
___
Back in Westeros, she wanted to quickly get rid of Cersei by burning King's Landing down (just a little bit). But as long as she was certain to win, she showed patience and listened to her wiser advisers. However, the second things turned sour and Tyrion got outmaneuvered by Jaime and Euron, she went back to her extremist thinking and was ready to burn it all in King's Landing. The only reason this did not happen and she moved on to burning part of the Lannister army and their food provisions instead was because she listened to the irresistible charisma of Jon Snow. He, who is becoming, by the end of season 7, the most important man to her eyes.
___

___
**Jon Snow, The Chosen One**
-
Now, if we know one thing about Jon Snow, it is that this man has the strongest urge of all to get himself killed (that honorable Stark blood running through his veins). Back at the wall, he went solo onto a suicide mission to negotiate a truce with Mance. The only reason he survived was because he got lucky that Stannis arrived in time. He brought the Wildlings south of the wall against everyone's will and he died for it. As soon as he was brought back to life, he went on another suicide battle against the Boltons where he was gravely outnumbered. Miraculously surviving long enough for the Knights of the Vale to save him. Then, he went on the craziest mission of all to bring back a Whight. And that would somehow convince Cersei to join their cause? He should have died for it (god bless plot armor). Jon Snow seems to be the most obvious depiction of the little hero who goes up against 20 villains and who in the end, ends up being fine no matter the odds, again and again, and again. But this is not the message GRRM wants to convey through this character and there have been enough of these stories already. The mastermind is baiting us once more.
___
In season 8, Daenerys's armies and the North will unite at Winterfell to fight the dead. The Night King's army cannot pass through the walls of Winterfell as the same magic that once formed the wall had been put into the Stark's ancestral home. However, Vyserion's blue fire manages to pierce through its magic and allows the dead to hit Winterfell. At great cost, the living will manage to get rid of Viserion. And the heroics of Jon &amp; co will allow men to succeed in stabbing the Night King with Valyrian steel (hence the Dagger Jon had inherited from Arya). The Night King's body will burst into pieces. But the army of the dead is still standing... The body of the Night King slowly reforms itself out of dust and his piercing blue eyes reappear. Neither Valyrian steel nor fire seem to stop him.
___
Seing their plan had failed and the army of the dead was progressively growing while men were being butchered, Jon orders a retreat. Half of the army flees by horse or through the secret tunnels of Winterfell while Jon &amp; a few others fly away on Dragons.
___
Dany &amp; Jon regroup at Dragonstone, where Dany is soon expecting a baby. The side of the living is running out of options. That is when a red Priestess appears through the dark night. Despite Jon's warning, Melisandre has returned to guide the living.
___
Melisandre explains why the Night King could not be defeated: the army of the dead, hence the Night King, can only be eradicated by one man, Azor Ahai (aka Jon Snow). However, even Azor Ahai can not vanquish the dead on his own. He needs to sacrifice his one true love (Daenerys Targaryen) in order to reforge a sacred weapon, Lightbringer. Only then would he be able to defeat the Night King. 
___
Being men of their words, Jon &amp; Davos have Melisandre executed for her past crimes. Melisandre had accepted her fate and knew she would die for it. And die she does. But she had finally completed the mission the Lord had been keeping her on this earth for so long: teaching his hero, the Chosen One, how to triumph over the dead. And so in peace she goes, relieved from her past and knowing she had fulfilled her part in the Lord's plan. 
___
But Melisandre was right. The situation is desperate. Dany understands this and is willing to sacrifice herself for the good of mankind. Or everything would be lost, forever. Jon knew it as well.
___
But Jon Aegon Stark Targaryen, stands for all that is good in this world. His heart is one of the few that is truly pure. In spite of all, in spite of knowing what would happen to the living, Jon cannot do it. Jon cannot bring himself to stab the women he loves and the mother of his unborn child. 
___
So instead, he decides to go with Jaime on one last suicidal mission: seeking the help of the Crown to unite the living and convince Cersei to join their cause, again. This time getting himself arrested. 
___
When hearing about this madness, Dany marches her armies to King's Landing and threatens to attack the city if her King is not released. Jaime urges Cersei to release the one man that could help mankind survive but Cersei refuses and chooses to fight instead. Except she knows full well she cannot win. She plans on burning the city with wildfire rather than let Daenerys savor victory. As Dany attacks, Cersei is about to give the order and have everything be burnt down.

**The Fate of Bran Stark**
-
Witnessing this massacre and realizing all hope is lost, Bran wargs into Drogon (the other dragon probably dies during the battle of Winterfell), and with the help of Beric Dondarrion (who likely saved his life at Winterfell) flies to the Isle of Faces, the center of all weirwood trees in Westeros, to try to change the past 
___
We know from poor Hodor and from the Three-Eyed Raven that in Game of Thrones, the past is a closed loop. Bran also knows it. The ink is dry, the past has already been written and it cannot be changed. But given how dire the situation is, this final desperate plan is understandable. At the Isle of Faces, Bran powers are amplified to such a degree that time flows incredibly much slower in the present compared to within his visions, giving him an insane amount of time to try to find a solution before the Night King arrives at his location. 
___
The first event of importance Bran goes back to is the resurrection of Jon Snow. Surely there will be a display of power from the lord of light to be witnessed there since he knows for certain a miracle is due to happen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6j-60Td0a4&amp;t=154s (2:34 - 8:11). Bran patiently waits and observes as Melisandre applies the lotions and performs the ritual to resurrect Jon Snow. But for 2 long minutes, nothing happens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6j-60Td0a4&amp;t=327s (5:27 - 7:51); and at 7:51, everyone but Ghost gives up and leaves the room 
___
Seeing the lord of light does not seem to care about Jon's life but knowing how crucial he will be in the future, Bran tries to resurrect the man himself... and succeeds! Except Bran does not really have the power to resurrect people. What he did was animate the dead parts of Jon's body (which is likely less than 10% of his body at this time) with his magic. 

Jon is now a moving being that is 90% alive and 10% fueled by Bran's abilities. This is why after being resurrected, he says he does not feel the same (cause he isn't, he is less alive than before). At this point, Bran realizes his magic is so strong that it can power dead bodies into moving again. The truth is the way Bran revives people is very similar to the way the children revived Benjen, when they left most of his conscience in him. Both Jon and Benjen are animated in part by the power of the weirwood net.
___
D&amp;D managed to make you believe the 2 minutes of void from ""5:27 - 8:11"" were solely here to build up the tension but in fact, it was the time it took Bran to understand he was needed to bring Jon Snow back to the living. 
___
At this very moment, Bran realized there was no Lord of Light, or if there was, he wasn't the one resurrecting people that would help with the war against the dead. He was.

-

After witnessing this, Bran started screening the past for similar prayers to the lord of light in order to keep alive people that would be of great importance in the final war. Thus resurrecting Beric and others as many times as needed (thats why Beric is being resurrected very quickly compared to Jons revival, because Bran is not hesitant anymore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI&amp;t=8s [0:08 - 0:34]). Going 400 years back to keep Melisandre alive, giving her a prolonged life so she would be alive in the future to guide Stannis to the North and save the Night's watch and Jon Snow from the wildlings crushing them at the battle of the Wall and so on.
___
And now, you understand why Lady Stoneheart is closer to a zombie than to a human being. Because she was revived  so late after her death that most of her Brain &amp; her body had died. Only vengeance remained in her. In the same way, poor Beric being brought back 6 times does not even have blood left in him and his body is mostly animated by Bran's powers. But at least, most of his brain has remained intact through all of his deaths.
___
Bran had learned he could use his powers through time but not yet how to communicate with people in the past. He knew that he could not warg into them or hed turn every Wylis into a Hodor. So he tried to let the believers of the lord of light know they should prepare against the dead by letting them see parts of his visions through fire (e.g. the visions Melisandre, Stannis, Beric, Kinvara &amp; Co.saw in flames). Thus effectively showing them part of the future. But this form of communication was not amounting to much as the visions were subject to many interpretations and not clear enough for everyone to rally behind one strong message: prepare for the fight against the dead.
___
So on his third trial, instead of trying to warn everyone about the army of the dead, Bran realized it would be wiser to focus all of his energy on explaining things to one person at a time. And if you are going to focus your efforts on one man, better make it a king, as convincing a king would equal to convincing everyone. To this end, he goes back to the nearest time where the 7 kingdoms where most united and the Whitewalker threat still minimal, before the war of the 5 kings, even before Roberts  Rebellion: the era of Aerys II Targaryen. 
___
The period when Aerys was taken captive and imprisoned proved to be the perfect opportunity for Bran, giving him enough time to talk to the King and explain the threat to him. But the visions Bran showed him through the fire next to his cell confused him. 
___
Bran realized he needed another way of communicating with the King. Then, he remembered what happened at the tower of Joy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcCawhWkwUg&amp;t=292s (4:52 - 5:40). Young Ned heard him. Not distinctly, but he heard him. And so Bran tried to speak to the King directly.
___
But it did not work. Even though Bran tried repeating his message over and over again, all the poor man could grasp was the wind whispering a few words that he later gathered into *burn them all*. This event caused Aerys to become paranoid and slowly drift into madness Once again, Bran had turned another mans brain into soup. At this point, you could even argue that Bran is the reason Robert rebellion started: had Aerys not turned mad, maybe he would not have burned the Starks thus preventing the whole rebellion from starting.
___
First Hodor, now a King This is when Bran fully grasped the dangers that come with not knowing how to control his powers. As we all know, *with great power comes great responsibility*. 
___

**Aerys II, A Targaryen Mess**
-
After this first traumatic encounter with Bran, Aerys did not turn mad all at once. But soon after he returned to King's Landing, new visions started to appear through fire and Aerys started hearing voices again... Except this time, it was an entirely different voice talking to him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY. This new voice and these news visions were Brynden Rivers', aka Bloodraven, aka the Three Eyed Raven. Brynden was trying to use the powers he had recently acquired through becoming the Three Eyed Raven to let Aerys know how to get rid of the Blackfyres for good.
___
To this end, Brynden showed Aerys repeated visions of Varys living in Essos, in an attempt to let him know he had to kill Varys to get rid of the rebellious Targaryens, the Blackfyres. 
___
Except interpreting visions is a very confusing task, just like trying to understand prophecies. Because when you try to come to a conclusion without sufficient information, your interpretation will be as flawed as anyone's (unless you are very lucky). *This is exactly how we manage to believe Ser Pounce could be Azor Ahai and Varys a Merman.*
___
So instead of having Varys dealt with in Essos, Aerys thought the visions were telling him that the master of spies would be of great help. Instead of executing him, Aerys had Varys brought to his court. This is when Brynden Rivers, aka the Three Eyed Raven, realized visions were not enough at all to convey his message. In this case, visions had had the opposite result from what he intended. Varys, on his end, had surprisingly found himself disposing of Aerys's trust while being in the perfect place to plot the return of the Blackfyres in Westeros. All the while convincing people his only intentions were to work for the good of the realm and the well being of the people (a deception not difficult to pull for the master of spiders, as he had been raised by a troop of actors).
___
Brynden had to act! He started relentlessly talking to Aerys on top of the visions, telling him to burn Varys, to burn his spiders, and to burn the Blackfyres.
___
No wonder Aerys turned Mad and paranoid. Even the healthiest man would have gone nuts after seeing visions of people and things he needed to burn while hearing indiscernable whispers that would not stop for years and years. Not to mention that his paranoia was continuously fueled by real whispers, the ones from a man Aerys trusted, Varys himself. Conspiring all along to weaken Aerys's reign and to weaken the peace of the realm so Aegon's invasion of King's Landing could be facilitated and perceived by the public as a saving act. And given that these visions and voices came from 2 different people (first Bran, then Brynden) with 2 very different agendas, even the mentally strong would have gone insane if they were not able to explain what was happening to them or what it all meant. 
___
After this tragic series of events, Brynden Rivers had witnessed how he had failed his King and caused the downfall of the ones he had tried so vividly to protect. All that was left for him now was to learn from his mistakes and try to help the children and the grand children of Aerys to reclaim their rightful throne (without using visions or whispers this time). To help the rightful heir of the Iron Throne, Jon Snow, he warged into Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's raven back at the Wall to influence Jon's destiny. While having Euron help Daenerys across the narrow see in the hope of seing both Jon &amp; Dany rule from the Iron Throne as King &amp; Queen.
___
Except after having enjoyed these new powers for a while, Bryndon had found himself completely trapped into the roots of the weirwood tree. But it wasn't just his body that would not move anymore, his will had been affected as well, slowly being bound to the will of the Children of the Forests...Until he had finally turned into their puppet.

**The Training**
-

Back in Bran's journey through the past, Bran understood he needed to master his talents if the living were ever going to have a chance at fighting the dead. And who could possibly help Bran complete his training if not the man that started training him in the first place, the Three-Eyed Raven. 
___
And so, the Three-Eyed Raven trains Bran and helps him fully master his powers.
___
But remember, neither Bran nor the Three-Eyed Raven (=TER) can see the future so how did the TER know so much when he meets Bran in season 5/6? He knew because he had met Bran at this moment in this past and Bran had shared his journey from the future with him, by uploading visions of his experiences into the weirwood net. This is why in season 6, Bran sees some parts of the future (like Drogon flying over King's Landing, the Mad King's saga, etc.). These are in fact the visions Bran had first shared with the TER at this moment back in time that are now being shared back into his younger self by the TER. *(a bit confusing, I know)*
___
And this is why the Three-Eyed Raven knew that he needed to call and guide Bran after Jaime pushed him through the window. This is why he knew Bran would come at some point in the future and that the first thing he says to him is that he was waiting for him. This is why he knew that Bran would fly: because Bran himself told him that he flew Drogon to come to the Isle of Faces. This is why he knew when he would die and looked so prepared. And this is why the Night King looked like he knew him (he does cause the Night King is Bran). 

*This is also how Melisandre knew Varys would die and burn in flames, because the TER had shared this vision from Bran's memories of the future with her.*
___
In our present timeline, to convince Jojen to join their side, the TER transferred some of Bran's visions from the future to Jojen. But like Jojen said, he is not a greenseer himself. So the TER had to warg a bit into Jojen's mind each time he needed to transfer a vision in him. To do that, the TER used a warging ability similar to the one Bran used on young Hodor, except with a much lesser amplitude. This is why with each vision, a small part of Jojen's brain is being destroyed and why the boy had mild strokes and blood coming through his nose after seing parts of the ""future"".  

___
After mastering his powers and having acquired an impossible amount of knowledge, Bran is now able to warg into people from different timelines and can fully control their bodies in order to interact with other humans from that timeline. 
___
But there is a severe cost to it. Remember what warging for 2 mins into Hodor did to his brain? It half destroyed it. So in order to successfully warg into a host and interact with other people from that timeline, the hosts brain has to get completely fried and Bran has to stay in that body until it dies So this is not a power Bran can simply use whenever he needs to as not only does he deliberately have to take a living being's life. But like the TER said: ""Stay too long where you don't belong, and you will never return""; it will also bind Bran's spirit to that host until the body dies (or until Bran suicides the host). 
___
___
___
**The War For The Dawn**
-
Through visions and with the help of the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran realizes that Bran the builder and every other major figure in the history of the war against the dead has been him warging into someone from that timeline. He realizes that in order to stand where he stands today, he has to go back in time and rewrite these stories the way they were once written. And so he does.
___
Through warging into many lifetimes, Bran helped men and the Children build the wall, helped build Winterfell, shared his knowledge and armed the first men with obsidian glass/dragon glass. He also founded house Stark (probably through warging into Bran the builder and getting down to business). 
___
Most importantly, he was there 8,000 years ago in a fight long forgotten, the War for the Dawn. But contrary to the fight lead by Jon Snow, this time, the living were united and fully prepared (Children + First Men + Bran + A  great hero, known as Azor Ahai). So the greatest alliance ever assembled fought and defeated the dead.
___
Let's take a moment to talk about a confusing drawing however, the one drawing of a Night King in the cave where Jon &amp; Daenerys go during s07 that looks nothing like the current Night King: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=199&amp;v=LJnMJc6Xgs0&amp;t=218s (3:38). Does this mean the Night King the Children &amp; the First Men were fighting at that time was different from the one in present day? 
___
To explain this, you need to understand that there has never been one single Night King to rule all White Walkers. There are 3 types of undead beings that constitute ""The Others"" : 1) Wights, that are raised and controlled by the Whitewalkers or the Night King; 2) White Walkers, controlled by a Night King, with the ability to raise Wights; and 3) Night Kings, a more powerful White Walker with the ability to create Whitewalkers from the living.
___
It is safe to assume that during this ancient time, being at war with men, the Children created many Night Kings at the same time, each having the ability to create his own army of White Walkers and Wights.  
___
This is why you can see drawings of a ""Night King"" that looks nothing like the one in our present because there were plenty different Night Kings, each being a different individual with his own army.
___
But all of them were defeated and destroyed during this War of the Dawn.
___
However, even the brave first men, with the help of Bran and the magic of the Children of the Forest could not get rid of one last Night King (the one sharing Bran's spirit). Dragon glass would not work, Valyrian steel would not work. No magical spell known to men or to the children would work. Even the legendary Lightbringer, mythical sword of Azor Ahai, would not work. The Night King body would recompose itself from ashes and dust every single time after being destructed. 
___
This is because the spirit of Bran, that lives in a timeline 8,000 years in the future is the backbone holding the body of the Night King together. And as long as Bran's body in the present timeline is not destroyed and/or the source of magic that moves the White Walkers is not destroyed, the Night King cannot be erased. But nor Bran, the first men or the Children knew this (as we see again, knowledge here would have been power). 
___
So Bran and the Children settled with sealing the Night King instead, far away in the North, beyond the Wall: where the Children could maintain the seal strong through generations; and where men would be protected when the threat was to reappear. 
___
And in case the Night King &amp; the White Walkers were to ever cross the wall in the future, Bran left a duplicate of the seal in the Crypts of Winterfell, identical to the one that had once stopped the Night King. Hence the saying ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"". A Stark would know how to defeat and seal the Night King. Unfortunately, that fundamental knowledge got lost in time, even to the Starks themselves...
___

___
**The Night's King, A Revenge Best Served Cold**
-
The Night King was created far before the Night's King ever existed. The Night King turning against its creators is the reason the Children sided with humans and decided to eliminate all the white walkers during the war for the dawn.
___
And during that war, there was one great hero, known as Azor Ahai. Bran knew the Night King could not be killed by anything but Lightbringer reforged as he had already witnessed Jon's failed attempt at stabbing the Night King during the battle of Winterfell. So he convinced Azor Ahai this was the only way to save mankind from the Night King's threat. And despite it breaking his heart, the man agreed to do it. Azor Ahai sacrificed his beloved wife for the greater good, by plunging his sword through her chest to forge the sacred Lightbringer. 
___
Expect it did not work. Sacrificing his wife did not amount to anything as his sword never became more than a flaming sword. And the so called forged ""Lightbringer"" was not able to get rid of the Night King either. So in the end, this poor man had killed his wife, Nissa Nissa, with his own hands, for no reason at all. Haunted by guilt, he joined the Night's Watch and later became the 13th lord commander. 
___
After the peace treaty between Men and Children was signed, the WW defeated and the Night King sealed far far away North of the Wall, a small fraction of the Children that were against peace with men decided to rebel. They knew about the torments of the 13th lord commander. So to manipulate him, they revived his beloved wife, Nissa Nissa, in the same way they revived Benjen on the show (leaving what was left of her conscience within her, so she'd be able to kind of think, remember and talk to her husband). Except Benjen was alive when he was turned and Nissa Nissa was not. This is why she has blue eyes. You can think of her as some sort of Lady Stoneheart, had she been revived by the Children instead. A small part of her former self remained, but most of her conscience had died.
___
Consumed by remorse and guilt over having killed his one true love for nothing, the 13th lord commander sided with the rebellious Children so at least, he could be with Nissa Nissa (or what remained of her), thus becoming the Night's King. In exchange for bringing back his wife, the Night's King supplied human sacrifices to the rebellious Children so they would turn the bodies into a new whitewalker army. With these whitewalkers, the rebellious Children intended to start another war against men (men that were cutting their trees and breaching the agreement by taking there sacred forests).  
___
But the mascarade quickly took a bad turn. The King in the North and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat the Night's King, the rebellious Children, and the new whitewalker threat they were harvesting.
___
In the end, by having the hero of the War for the Dawn, Azor Ahai, sacrifice his beloved wife for no reason,  Bran had indirectly driven the man into becoming a champion of the Others. Bran had created yet another monster that this time at least, he thought he had defeated. In an attempt to erase this huge mistake from history and preserve the legacy of Azor Ahai, Bran had all records of the 13th lord commander/Night's King destroyed, and uttering his name was forbidden, so it would become lost to history.
___
However, as Bran left the Night's King for dead after this event, a couple of rebellious Children found him half dead and turned him north of the wall into a white walker with most of his conscience left in him. In this state of existence, the same as Benjen in the show, he would be a good ally for them. He would become Coldhands. A whitewalker, with most of his conscience left, doomed to roam North of the Wall for 8,000 years without any chance at being reunited with his love Nissa Nissa, for only motivation to plot his revenge on Bran Stark.
___
And as they say, vengeance is best served cold (hence Coldhands). For 8,000 years, Coldhands had been waiting for Bran to be born. Back in present timeline, he could have killed young Bran when he met him North of the Wall. But what would be the point of killing a child that had not committed any crime yet? The best and most cruel revenge would be for him to help Bran &amp; Co safely reach the Three Eyed Raven and the Children. Ensuring that Bran would effectively complete his timeloop and commit these wrong doings in the past. And at the end of his time loop, after warging into the man that becomes the uncontrollable Night King, Bran would be the one to bring death and doom to the living he had sacrificed so much to protect. Coldhands would have made sure that Bran becomes the unstoppable force that would punish the living that had taken his love and his life from him in the worst way possible, by helping Bran safely reach the Children and the Three Eyed Raven.
___
This is why when Coldhands first meets Bran in the books, he says: he, Coldhands, is Brandon Stark's Monster (cause Bran created him by destroying his mental). And this is why Coldhands made sure to never reveal his face to young Bran, so that when Bran meets him (in his Azor Ahai/13th lord commander days) in his journey through the past, he cannot know that Azor Ahai would be the one to betray them and turn into the Night's King. By not revealing his face, Coldhands makes sure that history will repeat itself and Bran will complete his timeloop to become the Night King.
___
First Hodor, then Aerys II, a King, and now, the most legendary figure of all time Azor Ahai. Once again, Bran had messed up the past and people's lives because of his lack of knowledge.
___
Azor Ahai, the hero of the war for the dawn, the 13th lord commander, was the Night's King and is now Coldhands. The dead man that would make sure Bran would become the unstoppable Night King.

**Dawn of the Night King**
-

Bran had seen what the future beholds. He knew that 2,000 years later, the Andals would invad Westeros, conquering the First Men and killing the Children of the Forest wherever they encountered them. Thus damning the seal that had concealed the Night King for two thousand years, to be unsupervised and forgotten. Abandoning it to slowly fade until the day the Night King would once again be free 6,000 years later.
___
Knowing this, Bran could have warged into the body of a different man to make sure the seal remained strong another couple thousand years but this was not a solution. All it would have amounted to was to delay the problem. And although time in his present had slowed down to a minimum, the Night King and his army had slowly managed to come close to Brans real location, at the Isle of Faces where they were about to kill him.
___
So if nothing worked and if the Night King could not be defeated, what was the last thing left to do for Bran? Prevent the Children of the forest from ever creating the Night King in the first place.
___
Even though he knows the past has been written and the ink is dry, because veritably all hope is lost and absolutely nothing known to the living works, Bran goes further back in time one last round and takes control of the body of the man that he has seen to become the Night King. Bran possesses this body and makes him run away as far as possible from the main Heart tree north of the Wall (where it all started), either to save this man or to have him kill himself and get rid of the possibility of the Night King ever appearing.
___
But the Children of the Forest still capture him and as much as Bran tries to convince them not to turn this specific body into a Night King Whitewalker, they follow through creating what would become ""the"" Night King. Blinded by their hatred for men (men that were stealing their lands and killing them), instead of listening, the Children turned Bran into a White Walker. Trapped and unable to kill himself in order to get out of this body, Brans spirit held within the body of that man turned into an uncontrollable White Walker that attacks both men and the Children. Thus losing almost all consciousness and turning into the strongest destructive being there would ever be, the Night King.
___
But in spite of all, one shred of his former self remained in this new Bran/Night King, his strongest will. The single conviction that relentlessly drove Brans actions throughout the many lives he had lived in multiple timelines: the drive to protect the living.
___
Time has run out...

**The Doom of the Children**
-
As a result, in an attempt to defend themselves against Man, the Children had created the weapon of mass destruction that would be their doom.
___
Let's take this moment to reflect on what their story was. Most people assume at first glance that the Children and the Three Eyed Raven were a bunch of nice magical beings helping Bran rid the world of the worst evil it has ever known, the white walkers. But is this really what they were doing? 

*(credit to Milos for helping connect the dots for the Children's storyline: https://us.blastingnews.com/editorial-staff/milos-kitanovic/)*
___
The Children's peaceful lifestyle and harmony with nature was first destroyed by the First Men invading Westeros and destroying their sacred trees. In a war where they were out-powered and outnumbered, the Children had to create the White Walkers, a weapon that would fight men and turn their numbers against them. 
___
Aside from these, the Children designed a few special white walkers, with the ability to create white walker generals and control their own army of wights. These are referred in the show as Night Kings (because they conveniently have what looks like a little crown on top of their head). This is why Martin has said he prefers the term Night's King. Because the Night's King is a real character whereas there has never been one single Night King to rule all the white walkers. The Children created many of these beings at the same time that went on to fight men for them. 
___
Even with an otherworldly army, after centuries of endless fighting, the Children were losing. On the other hand, getting rid of all the Children would have proved too high of a cost for men (endless guerrilla with Children turning the dead against them). So the wisest of the First Men met with the Children leaders and formed a peace treaty, the pact: an agreement that stipulated men would get the lands while the Children would get the forests. In the meantime, men would never again cut a sacred weirwood tree while the Children would erase White Walkers from Westeros. Thus were the terms of the pact agreed upon and the nature of the peace that followed for four centuries.
___
However, after enough generations had passed, as their civilizations were growing, some men started cutting down weirdwood trees again and invading forests.
___
Witnessing what they had suspected all along, the Children realized men could not be trusted and needed to be dealt with. So in response, they secretly harvested a new army of white walkers in the North.
___
To this end, the Children kidnapped humans. Some were used to create Night Kings, others were turned into White Walker generals by their Night King. 
___
After enough time had passed, rumors and whispers had taken root in villages. Why were so many people disappearing lately?
___
To investigate the matter, the Lord of the North led a ranging party with some of his most trusted men. When they found out the Children had been creating a new White Walker army, they were infuriated and enraged by this traitorous act. The brave Lord and his men attacked the Children, ultimately leading to the lot of them getting captured.

___
But one of his men had Bran' spirit warging inside of him and when the Children turned the Northerner into a NK, he went out of control and attacked his creators. The Children tried to get rid of the failed experiment but they could not destroy the body of that NK. Nothing was working and the more the Children were struggling to fight this NK, the more his army of rebellious white walkers was growing. Soon, the threat had gone disproportionate and out of control.
___
To avoid getting whipped by their own creation, the Children went south to ask for men's help. But the Children made sure not to tell men the truth. Instead, they lied and covered their treachery with the story of a massive White Walker army that had appeared out of nowhere to wipe out the living.
___ 
Soon after, Children and Men had joined forces and had defeated the White Walkers in the War for the Dawn. 
___
The Children had no idea why this particular Night King went out of control. And they had now seen how dangerous it could be to manipulate the dead. On the other hand, the new leader of men had left quite an impression on the Children. They could not deny how well intentioned and knowledgeable their peaceful King, Bran Stark, seemed to be. Therefore, the Children agreed the wisest thing to do was to give peace a second chance.
___
But they had already been there before: having to put their faith in men, again. And they had seen what it had led to: betrayal. Convinced there could never be peace with Man, a little group of dissident Children decided to start another army of white walkers. Hence the Night's King saga. But most Children still supported the peace treaty and after the Night's King incident had been dealt with, both Starks and Wildlings promised they would make sure the treaty would always be respected. And so it was for 2,000 years.
___
However, when the Andals invaded the first men and killed most of the Children, they had no regard for the Children's lives, let alone any pact that would have once stood.
___
Despite being slaughtered, the Children could not use the white walker weapon as they were as likely as men to turn against them. And they had not yet figured out what had gone wrong with this specific Night King.
___
So for 6,000 years, the Children searched for a way to save their race. As millennia passed, the Children of Westeros realized no matter what they would do, their specie was doomed and could not be saved. In the end, all of this was Man's fault. If not for men invading, they would have never created the weapon of mass destruction that nearly wiped them all. If not for men invading again (Andals), they would have never gone extinct. If not for men, their sacred trees that they believe to represent the after life would still be standing. Even 8,000 years later, Man was still the enemy, Man had always been the enemy... and Man had won.

**Valar Morghulis**
-

Back 500 years before our present timeline, the remaining Children in Westeros knew their end would come and had accepted their fate. But they could not resign themselves with dying while the crimes committed by men were left unpunished. Through all their time studying the Knight King, they had finally managed to understand what he was. They realized that most of his uncontrollable powers and his invincibility came from another stronger spirit from another timeline in the future having been mixed and intertwined in the process. And thanks to history and the many encounters they had had with one particular warg, they realized only this sorcerer coud have been strong enough to create such a mess: Brandon Stark.
___
To punish men, there was one last unstoppable weapon they knew they could release. A weapon that could not be stopped. A weapon that would ensure their revenge on Man even after their extinction: the Night King.
___
But releasing the Night King would have resulted in a failure as the knowledgeable Valyrians and their thousand dragons would have wiped out any white walker threat in no time, no matter the size. Therefore, they had to get rid of the Dragons first.
___
A century before Aegon's first landing in Westeros, just like they had once shattered the Arm of Dorne, the Children destroyed Valyria by creating a cataclysmic disaster. An event that came to be known as ""the Doom"": laying waste to the Valyrians, their capital city, and its surrounding lands. The peninsula itself was shattered. Every dragon was thought to be lost... as were the Valyrian spells, knowledge, and recorded history.
___
But this was not enough, as there were still many books, scrolls and other manuscripts laying around the world that would help men fight any White Walker threat. The Children could not risk wasting their last ace without having first maximized the Night King's chances at erasing mankind. On top of that, a handful of Valyrians and Dragons had also survived the doom of Valyria and had proceeded to conquer Westeros and create a new realm for Targaryens and Dragons alike to prosper in, the Seven Kingdoms.
___
Getting rid of these hurdles would have proven too big of a challenge for the Children alone. And they knew it. They needed allies inside the realm of men if they were to ever accomplish such miracles. 
___
To do so, even before the Doom of Valyria, the Children created a religion of death worshipers, the cult of the Many Faced God. And what better allies to start your cult with than the thousands slaves, being worked to death under the great volcanic mountain chain, whose eruption could even cause the destruction of Valyria? 
___
These slaves, from a hundred different lands, faced death on a daily basis, all so their Valyrian masters would enjoy their wealthy lifestyles. This proved the perfect starting point for the Children. Disguised as men, the Children taught these faithful men how to bring the gift of death to others: first, to their brothers in pain to end their sufferings, then to the slave masters themselves... In exchange for having shared a bit of their magic and knowledge with those broken slaves, the Children had acquired a legion of faithful servants which would later become the Faceless Men: skilled assassins, acting under many disguises, under many names and many faces, as *No One*.
___
These broken slaves were ready to turn into perfect mindless weapons serving the Children's agenda. If this way of proceeding sounds familiar, it is because this is how the Children used the First Men during the Age of Dawn. Back then, they were turning men into obedient white walkers against their will with the help of magic and dragon glass. Now, they had found a much safer way: let the mentally weak and the broken willingly turn themselves into their faithful servants (just like the 13th Lord Commander/Night's King had once done). These people would brainwash themselves in the hope of finding a higher purpose to their existence (i.e. serving the will of the God of Death, which is really the voices of the Children).
___
*This is exactly the mental state Arya was in when she first joined the cult: a completely broken girl, the perfect target for the Many Faced God/Children. Had it not been for her obsession with her list of names and for the last bit of Arya Stark resurfacing at the end, she would have lost herself completely to this higher cause, in one final attempt to find herself a pack to be part of.*

*And this is why Martin has said the Faceless Men have been around for thousands of years. The cult of the Faceless Men did not exist 1,000 years ago. But the Children disguised as men did (aka the original Faceless Men). And they had been roaming around the lands of men for thousands of years.*
___
In time, the slaves started blindly obeying the will of the Many Faced God (i.e. Children passing as the voices of the god of death): *Valar Dohaeris*, ""All men must serve"". As this god had been the only one answering their prayers and offering them help when they needed it most.  
___
With centuries passing, the religion grew, slowly gaining more and more followers. When the time came, they chose the free city of Braavos to establish their main temple, the House of Black &amp; White. It was no coincidence that the Faceless Men had found themselves so close to the Iron Bank. This place was the closest thing there had ever been to a King of Mankind. Whoever had his hand on it had a strong hold on the fate of men. The Children knew it and by having their faithful servants establish to this key area, they would ensure Mankind would never find itself in a sustained state of peace or unity for too long. Thus maximizing division between the ranks of men and keeping mankind as weak and vulnerable as possible for the return of the White Walkers.
___
In the end, what had the Many Faced God ever been if not the weirwood gods worshiped by the Children? Just like the many faces sculpted into the weirwood trees. And while one would think ""All men must die"" referred to ""all men eventually die in time"". For the countless sins men had committed to the Children over thousands of years, the true meaning of these words had always been:

*""Valar morghulis, All men must be killed""*.

-

With the help of their newly devoted faceless followers, the Children first orchestrated the Doom of Valyria, then the ""Tragedy of Summerhall"": a fire that caused the deaths of King Aegon V Targaryen, his eldest son, Prince Duncan Targaryen, and Ser Duncan the Tall, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. With this massacre, the Children got rid of the possibility of King Aegon ever restoring dragons to the Seven Kingdoms. This is also why Jaqen H'ghar and other Faceless Men had been working across generations to rid the Citadel and any other place from books or information that would prove key against the dead. And this is why in our present timeline, the Faceless Men had infiltrated the Citadel to find a way to get rid of Dany's dragons : so no one would be able to stop the White Walkers.


___
After 500 years of hard work, the Children had found themselves in the best environment possible for the return of the Night King. So roughly 50 years before our present timeline, Leaf &amp; the remaining Children released the Night King and let him loose on mankind.
___
The Children had eyes on lands through the weirwood net and were confident the White Walkers would rip men apart on there. But this was not enough... What about the seas? What was to stop men from simply fleeing by boat and never directly confronting the White Walker threat? Could the Children allow some men to live simply because they had found themselves on a ship when the White walkers were passing by? Never.
___
They needed eyes and allies roaming the seas. And which better allies than the Ironborn could you aim for? To this end, the Children had Bloodraven/TER (an obedient puppet by then), awaken &amp; train the powers of one particular Iron Born, Euron Greyjoy. No wonder Euron's assassin skills seem similar to those of the Faceless Men. As both the Faceless Men &amp; Euron were trained by the Children, either directly or indirectly through the TER. 
___
At first, Bloodraven had Euron retrieve Dragonbinder, a large dragon horn artefact with Valyrian glyphs that would allow Euron to make sure Dany's dragons would be controlled no matter the outcome. The plan was to bait Daenerys into a marriage like Brynden Rivers had initially wanted. But Euron never intended on helping her sit on the Iron Throne, he had better intentions. After having brutally murdered her, Euron would have taken control over her dragons and would have used them to burn Westeros down. After that, Euron would kill the dragons. Meanwhile, the Ironborn would think he was honoring their traditions &amp; lifestyle by pillaging and murdering around. While in truth, it was the perfect opportunity for the Children to weaken the realm of men from the seas. But the scheme failed as Dany showed no interest in his proposal.
___
On the other hand, the TER had Euron believing he was the Drowned God. And in order to be released from his human prison of flesh, he needed to capture priests from all over the world, to use as human sacrifices in a massive ritual. The lives of these men would have allowed Euron to cast one of the most powerful spells known to the Children: the wrath of the seas. 
___
Leaf &amp; co. had learnt through Bran's visit back in time that the Night King was destined to make it past the Wall, they knew the living would be defeated at Winterfell and would be at its weakest. Surely, some men would try to flee from the White Walkers by sea then. The Children could not let that happen.
___
Right at this moment, they would have had their faithful servant, *Euron Greyjoy, the ""first storm and the last""* sacrifice himself with his priests to cast the most powerful storm the world had ever seen: a blow so strong, than tsunamis, cyclones &amp; tidal waves alike would emerge from the depths of the seas, destroying every ship and drowning every man that would dare to venture over water. Except Euron had thought he'd be reborn into the Drawn God through this sacrifice, awakened alongside the Kraken. Little did he know.

___
___
But this was still not enough... For this plan to be unbreakable, Leaf &amp; co. had to make sure that young Bran would effectively complete his timeloop and would become the Night King. They could not let luck intervene with their plans. So to have Bran reach out to them and to guide him, they had recruited the Three Eyed Raven (a man that soon enough became more of a prisoner to the roots that had grown across his body than anything resembling free will). He then manipulated Jojen &amp; Meera Reed into thinking Bran would be the Savior. To help Bran safely travel North of the Wall, they recruited the dead being that had been fueled by hatred against Bran for 8,000 years: Coldhands (aka Night's King aka 13th Lord Commander aka Azor Ahai). PS. In the show, it's Benjen. We can assume it was not hard to manipulate him into thinking he was helping Bran by escorting him to the Three Eyed Raven and to the Children (the Starks have never been renowned for their intelligence: *""The Starks...Quick tempers, Slow minds.""* Peter Baelish, season 1, GoT.
___
The Children and the Three Eyed Raven knew the Night King would apply his mark on Bran and that they would die for it. But they were ready.
___
Their final unstoppable bomb against men had been planted. Nothing could now stop the wheel of fate... Or so they thought.

**A 10,000 year long journey, Bran the Undying**
-
As punishment for the sins he had committed by creating the Night King, Bran has to relieve all the events he had fought against through so many lives and so many timelines. But this time, from the other side, the side of the dead; While trapped in the uncontrollable body of his worst enemy, the Night King; And being the one inflicting death to the living he had so desperately tried to protect. 
___
And so the Greek tragedy ensues. Bran relives the War for the Dawn while knowing what destiny beholds and tragically witnessing how it could never be stopped.
___
After being defeated in the War for the Dawn and being sealed for 8,000 years, Bran had experienced 8,000 years of Hell on earth. Still, all this time, he had relentlessly been searching for an opportunity to redeem himself from his sins.

___
Bran knew he was trapped in an uncontrollable body that can either do one of two things: 1) kill  and 2) forever grow his army of killing machines (Wights) that will bring death, without limits. Bran had seen (during the eight thousand years he'd been stuck in the Night King) that he could not be stopped and could not be destroyed by anyone or anything in the realm of the living. What could he do then?
___
He'd have to try to stop himself himself by using the only 2 tools at his disposal: 1) killing and 2) growing his army. As soon as he was freed from the seal that had been holding him for 8,000 years, he started assembling  an army of Wights and White Walkers that he knew big enough to be unstoppable by Jon Snow and Co. Second, he  killed and acquired a dragon to get rid of the Wall that was blocking him. Third, he had to march south to destroy his self and the power that fueled his existence, the main Heart tree at the Isle of Faces. In the meantime, he had  drawn down his destination using dead bodies so people could eventually understand his intentions, and hopefully move away from his path so he would not have to kill them on autopilot. 
___
However, in one last attempt to prevent history from repeating itself, Bran in the Night King tries to warn young Bran about the seal hidden in the Crypts of Winterfell:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI&amp;t=1295s (21:35 - 22:20); 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI&amp;t=1652s (27:32 - 28:10); 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI&amp;t=2417s (40:17 - 42:26).
___
On 3 separate occasions, Bran/NK warged into a crow inside Bran's dreams (as well as into Rickon's dreams) to try to lead Bran to the seal that had long been buried under Winterfell, right under Ned's statue.
___
He also warged into Jojen Reed's dreams in the form of this Three Eyed Crow to try to let him know about the seal:*""A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them."", ACOK, Bran IV*

The Crow was telling him to dig under the crypt of Winterfell and retrieve this ancient Artefact.
___
Jojen ended up figuring out who that crow was: the ""Crow is you Bran"". Jojen was right, the crow was Bran indeed. Except 10,000 years older and trapped in the Night King's body. http://i.imgur.com/axIeR4I.jpg . Unfortunately, even Jojen could not put the pieces together and understand what the crow was trying to tell him.
___
On his end, Bran/NK had figured that if young Bran, Rickon or Jojen had managed to find out about the seal, when the time would come for Bran/NK to attack Winterfell in season 8, after Jon &amp; Co would have valiantly stabbed him with Valyrian steel, they would have a shot at stopping him for good by sealing his body. This way, Bran/NK would prevent Jon from dying by never having him go south to ask for Cersei's help. Thus preventing Dany from going berserk on King's Landing and dying. While also preventing young Bran from ever having to go back in time and risk turning into the Night King. It would break the timeloop and save many many lives.
___
Except it did not work as neither Bran, Rickon or Jojen could manage to understand that they were supposed to find something in these crypts, let alone learn about the seal's existence. So for the last time in his 10,000 year long journey, Bran/NK had witnessed how the past could never be rewritten.
___
And so he set himself towards his last mission: stopping himself himself. 

___
But how would Bran in the Night King stop himself since he can't attack or destroy his body directly? Well, he'd have to destroy both the living soul that is making him indestructible (by killing Bran's body in the present timeline) &amp; destroy the power that his fueling his existence (the main Heart tree at the Isle of Faces, connected to all weirwood trees in Westeros). By marking Bran, he'd be able to break any magical barrier protecting him and he'd know at every moment where to find him. That's why the dead will specifically attack Winterfell in s08e03 instead of marching south for the Isle, simply because Bran will be there. Once Bran's real body and the Heart tree are destroyed, the Night King and his army will also be destroyed, effectively saving the living from his threat.
___
(And that's why King's Landing will never be attacked by the army of the dead and people will never know how the threat disappeared, because the Isle of Faces is further North from King's Landing on the Westerosi map.)
___
Back in present day, the Night King and his army arrive in front of the soulless body of Bran. The Night King kills Drogon and Beric, destroys the source of power that has kept him bound to the White Walker curse and kills himself by killing Bran.
___
All White Walkers, Wights and the Night King die and fade to dust. The living have been saved by the dead.
___
So in the end, the Night King killed for no reason (because he could not control his body that acts on autopilot as a killing machine against any hostile living being) and he also killed for a reason (to stop himself from keeping on killing and destroying the living for eternity).
___
Like Martin said it would happen: ""Sauron (= the Night King) is defeated and the ring (= Heart tree at the Isle of Faces = power that fuels the dead) destroyed in the end""; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaFViB8mZ9I&amp;t=135s (2:15 - 2:30). But would you say the Night King was an evil person, like Sauron was in the LOTR?
___
That's where Martin's genius for creating morally complex and grey characters hits you: Bran/ the Night King was the most evil character ever created, acting for Good, with the most evil tools and methods imaginable, in order to save the living, from an evil he himself created, himself! He is the savior that redeems himself from the evil he created, himself. See how deep it is?
___
What at first glance looked like an obvious fight between Good vs Evil becomes in the end, a deep internal conflit between young Bran (=Bran in the present, immature &amp; quick to jump to conclusions) and wise Bran (= Bran as the Night King, more than 10,000 years old). As Martin always said: ""the only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself"".
___
So in the end, all of the countless lives destroyed across 10,000 years were the consequence of one thing: Bran's and the living's lack of knowledge regarding the White Walkers.
___
Knowledge is Power. *And so we come full circle.*

**A Martinesque Ending**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=923s (15:23  16:09) Baelish: *One of two things will happen, either the dead will defeat the living in which case all our troubles come to an end or life will win out! And what then?""*
___

Back in King's Landing, people have learned that the army of the dead has vanished. No one knows how or why (since every witness at the Isle of Faces has died) but everyone knows Littlefinger is the hero that saved Westeros from the mad Targaryen invader. 
___
King's Landing has no more potential ruler left. Every Targaryen and Stark got themselves killed (aside from Sansa). Every Baratheon has long been dead (aside from Gendry the bastard) and every Lannister that is not a dwarf supporting a mad Targaryen is dead. The Tyrells are dead. The Greyjoys are dead. And the Dornish have never been an option and are dead anyways. Which credible character is left to rule?
___
The only man with experience that is regarded as a hero by the people of King's Landing. The man that saved the Lady of Winterfell from the Boltons. The man that is beloved by the current ruler of the Vale. The man that would sit on the Iron Throne to rule even the ashes. The man that was reborn to rid King's Landing of the dragon queen: Peter *Littlefinger* Baelish.
___
And who writes history in the end? The winners. 
___
If the GoT community was able to convincingly fit Ser Pounce into the prince that was promised/Azor Ahai prophecy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_277828913&amp;feature=iv&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLn6yDpEottdhisSEKJE3Sv5fpYQuej0Ju&amp;src_vid=Ge6VduBUJFo&amp;v=M7sh3rG96Ew), how hard do you think it will be for Baelish and the noble scientists at the citadel, or the faithful priests from the Lord of Light or the Seven to explain the end of the White Walkers and the rise of their new King in history books? Even if in truth, they have no clue what happened:
___
*Our noble King, Paeter Belish, First of his name, King of the Andals, the Chosen One, Azor Ahai, etc., was reborn amid smoke and salt* (a burning King's Landing capital is the perfect place to find both of those) *to slay the mad Dragon girl with his ancient flaming sword, Lightbringer* (whether or not his dagger was in flames that time does not really matter as the fanatics in Westeros will make up a convincing explanation: her body was in flames or something). 

*And when all hope was lost, Azor Ahai saved us all from the long night and the army of the dead by single handedly defeating the Night King. But at great cost. The Hero had to sacrifice his one true love, Lady Lysa Arryn, who bravely gave her life, for the sacred Valyrian dagger to be reforged into the divine flaming sword, Lightbringer. And all darkness faded, the Sun appeared and smiled upon his face as all were saved through the heroism of the Chosen One. Long live Azor Ahai. Long live our King Peter Baelish. May he reign forever.*
___
This, is the new lie that will unite the realm. A divine story that will bring peace to the 7 Kingdoms, under the reign of their heroic savior, Azor Ahai/King Littlefinger.

*""Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's ennemies. A story we agree to tell each other, over and over, until we forget that it's a lie.""* Baelish https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4&amp;t=112s (1:52 - 2:08)
___
Tyrion gets Casterly Rock. Littlefinger marries Sansa and unites the North and the South. Tyrion gives Bronn his two castles, the Twins. Gendry either goes back to rowing or gets Storm's End. 10 years later, we see a physically fit and agile young boy from a poor background struggling in the streets of Essos, a boy who has had to fight to make his way in the world. This boy is the true heir to the Iron Throne, a little orphan who may become the Stallion Who Mounts the World. This boy had been saved and smuggled to Essos by Missandei after the death of both of his parents, Jon Snow &amp; Daenerys Targaryen. 
___
Sam sits down and starts writing the song of Ice &amp; Fire for history to remember. By the time he has become an old man, Sam is still writing the books with Gilly by his side as he now looks like the spitting image of George R R Martin (cue cameo with GRRM &amp; his wife Paris Mc Bride *[who actually has red hair like Gilly]*: http://www.zimbio.com/photos/George+R.R.+Martin/Paris+McBride).

I think HBO made GRRM sign a contract stipulating that he would not sell ASOIAF books while GoT is on television. They probably don't want a competing product on the marketplace because it would hurt BLU-RAY/DVD sales.  In economic terms, ASOIAF books are a [substitute good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good) for the GoT DVD box set and it would likely make consumers desire the box set less if both of these products existed in the marketplace simultaneously.

Signing this contract was probably required in order for HBO to produce the show. Think about it: Why would HBO invest 100s of millions of dollars into a show and lose sales to a competing product?

It's good business for both HBO and GRRM: HBO gets to monopolize GoT for 8 years, GRRM gets free advertising and a wider commercial audience for his next book and they both make a ton of money. Everybody gets what they want without stepping on each other's toes.

It would explain why Winds of Winter is taking so long and why we hear practically nothing about it. He likely signed a non-disclosure agreement regarding information on his next book. HBO wants to funnel all the attention towards Game of Thrones right now. GRRM is under contractual obligation to be quiet about ASOIAF until GoT has run its course.

It would explain why GRRM has been publishing so many spin off and prequel series; he's not allowed to publish ASOIAF right now.

Many fans have noted that GoT feels rushed compared to the book series. It seems like they're just trying to finish instead of taking their time and telling the story properly, which doesn't make sense because HBO would have renewed GoT for as many seasons as D&amp;D wanted. It's the most popular television show of all time and there's plenty of source material. There's no need to rush telling this story unless it was  agreed upon in the contract that they would finish the show in a given time frame so GRRM could sell his books again.

It was agreed upon from the beginning that GoT would have 8 seasons, that's why they're rushing things and that's why they're making so many spinoff series. Otherwise they would be milking the show for as long as possible, but they can't do that so they are trying to capture some of that trajectory in these spinoff shows.

A Dance with Dragons came out on July 12, 2011, two months after the premiere of Game of Thrones on April 17th. It's possible that A Dance with Dragons was already slated for release before GRRM signed the contract or maybe they allowed him to release this one because he already had it done. Aside from that book which came out very early in season 1, we haven't seen a new ASOIAF book in the entire show's run. I don't think it's coincidental.

My theory is that Winds of Winter is already finished, and A Dream of Spring is at least halfway finished. Winds of Winter will be coming out holiday season 2020. That way Game of Thrones can finish by 2019 and sell ""complete package"" DVD boxes for holiday season 2019 without competing for Winds of Winter book sales.

A Dream of Spring will probably come out the following holiday season, 2021, one full year after Winds of Winter.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

307,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-4-6,2018,4,6,3,8a2exv,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] I have a question about Cersei,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8a2exv/spoilers_i_have_a_question_about_cersei/,jamiminin,1522954347,"G.R.R. Martin promised a bittersweet ending. I thought about Cersei - she is hated in this moment and seems to become the ""mad Queen"". But she seemed ""evil"" just from the beginning of the show / of the books. So becoming the ""mad Queen"" wouldnt be a big changing in her character. The fight between house Stark and House Lannister did beginn because Littlefinger killed Jon Arryn. Sure - Jaime threw Bran out of the window - that is not very nice - but Cersei and Jaime did that to protect their secret: the life of their children. Cersei was forced by her father to marry Robert Barratheon and Robert treated her not very well trough the years. Sometimes (while reading the books) I had the feeling, that Robert hates Cersei just because she is alive (and Lyanna not). Cersei was a good mother and everything she did was for her children. I think Bran can not hate her or Jaime - and that he understand. And I think, that the Starks will see Cersei in a different way, because they know now, that Littlefinger turned them against each other. Perhaps they will explain that to Cersei. In the beginning I thought that Cersei or the Lannisters did kill Jon Arryn, but they didnt - and Tyrion didnt try to kill Bran with that noble knife. This attack were made by Joffrey - a cruel blind child, who tried to please his father, who said that it would be mercy if Bran dies. G.R.R: Martin confirmed that it was Joffrey. So Jaime and Cersei didnt heire a person to kill Bran (and they dont know that Joffrey did it). At the beginning Cersei seemed to be evil and I thought she wanna destroy the Starks without any reason. But in her point of view the Starks threatend her without any reason. For her the start of that fight isnt understandable because she dont know about Littlefingers ladder of chaos. She got that prophecy that all of her children will die - and they did. All of them. That is so sad, because she wanted to protect her children with most of her actings. The death of her daughter was so sad, because Mercilla was a good person. And I felt kind of happy for Cersei, that she could revenge her daughter. Although the sandsnakes were fighting for Daenerys. Cersei got her revenge: she killed the sandsnakes and she killed Olenna (and soon she will find out through Jamie, that it was Olenna who killed Joffrey - not Tyrion or Sansa).

Dont get me wrong - I am pretty sure, that history will repeat - and that Jaime will be the ""Queenslayer"" - the younger brother with his fingers around her neck - the neck of the ""mad Queen"". Sure she will have a miscarriage and get mad because of it. But I think, that this is a little bit sad. In the beginning I thought, that Cersei is evil - then I found out, that she was less evil than I thought and that she didnt start that fight and that she just tried to protect her children - and then she will be the ""evil mad Queen"". I dont like that evolving of her character. I would like to see, that she will do something heroic to rescue somebody. That she turns the golden company against Euron after her miscarriage. That the lost of this unborn child will change her mind in a different way: ""Why fighting for the iron throne? With no children left?"". That she will help the Starks against the White Walkers (that she follows Jaime). That she will choose Jaime (love) - to love Jamie and to choose her lover on her own and to be free without being commanded by a man were a big wishes of her. I hope that would become true for her. The only wish, that in that case wouldnt come true would be a child of her own. But wouldnt it be a bittersweet ending, if Jon Snow dies while fighting the White Walkers and if Daenerys would die while giving birth? And wouldnt it be bittersweet, if Cersei would live and protect the child of them - so that she can be a kind of mother again - the mother of a child, that is not doomed to death? If that baby of Jon and Daenerys would be a girl - the prophecy ""a younger beautyful Queen will come"" would become true too. But it wont be a threat to Cersei anymore. I really dont think that this will happen.

But I would like to know, if somebody has similar feelings about Cersei? ""The villain is the hero of the other side"". Is there anybody who would like to see Cersei evolving in a different direction than the ""mad Queen""? Who wishes, that Cersei will do something heroic? And that at least a few of her dreams come true?

Also, we've seen in the show how there's a non-verbal and almost telepathic bond between her and Drogon. Not only they seem to sense each other's presence, every time she experiences some form of emotional distress or her life is in danger, Drogon comes to her.

318,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-4-6,2018,4,6,8,8a4p68,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] What will Gendry's big role be?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8a4p68/spoilers_what_will_gendrys_big_role_be/,darrylthedudeWayne,1522971238,"So Joe Dempsie (the actor who plays Gendry) has recently stated that Gendry has a big role to play next season, What is that role...Besides forging Dragonglass weapons anyways. I say besides that because we know he will and I feel the important role has to be something more then just forging Dragonglass Weapons and possibly Valryian Steel mainly because I feel the way it's worded makes me feel like it is something besides that. Don't get me wrong I think he will Forge Dragonglass and possibly more Valryian Weapons and we may see him reforge his Hammer, but I think his important role will not be just that.

So here are some ideas for what it could be:

1. He dies- Okay No, No, No just because they say he has an important role DOES NOT MEAN IMMEDIATE DEATH. Okay yes maybe his important role could lead to a death maybe he has to sacrifice himself to save Arya or (In a Ironic and Poetic fashion) Jon, but I don't think Gendry will die they would not reintroduce him just to kill himself, and before you start Rickon and Osha are different due to them being Shaggydog stories.

2. He Kills Mel or something related to Mel- Okay so another thing that maybe this big role could involve Mel in someway, maybe he is the one who kills Mel or Mel will try to use him for a blood sacrifice again but this time burn him or take more amounts of blood, I hope not for that but maybe.

3. He is Azor Ahai/The Prince That Was Promised- Okay before everyone gets on my case about this, no I don't think it is likely at all but I wanted to mention it anyways. So another way of looking at it is that Gendry may end up being Azor Ahai, Being Reborn admits salt and smoke from...Um....Forging steel, and born under the bleeding star via the Red Comet, has the blood of the Dragon since his great grandmother was a Targaryen, Lightbringer may just be a Metaphor for Valryian Steel (with Nissa Nissa being misinterpreted), and he will awaken the dragon out of stone by....Okay yeah the theory of Gendry being Azor Ahai has some holes in it which is why I don't think it will be the Important role Gendry has in store but it still worth mentioning.

4. a Romance with Arya- Now his important role could actually just being a romance with Arya, Now for some reason people think it will be Sansa (which makes no sense by the way) but the more likely one is Arya, as they have forshadowed in more and it would be a better match then Sansa.

5. Mission to KL- I had a theory/Prediction awhile ago that Jon and Dany would decide Cersei and Euron need to be taken care of if they are to rebuild the world after this war, so they send Jaime, Gendry, Arya, The Hound, Brienne, and possibly Pod to go and deal with Cersei while Jon and Dany deal with the WW's. Gendry having an important role could support my theory as that would be very important task.",60,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

The unofficial Lannister house motto, A Lannister always pays his debts, could be directly referring to Jaimes debt to Rhaegar. 

As we know, Jaime has always felt the sting of regret for letting Rhaegars children be murdered. With Jon being Rhaegars last remaining child, perhaps Jaime will pay his debt by protecting him. That is, Jaime may ultimately lose his life in order to protect Jon, allowing him and Dany to rule the seven kingdoms after our story ends.

Full Disclosure: this fits with my [theory ](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6dx676/spoilers_main_ive_been_working_on_a_theory_about/) here. So I may be a little biased.

We are given a chance to see how much The Hound has changed over the period of time from Arya leaving him for dead to him venturing north in Season 7. In season 7 we see Sandor bury a family that he had left for dead (essentially) back in season 4. 

Back in Book 3, a Storm of Swords (pg. 887), however The Hound had a passage in Arya's chapter replying to Arya who has suggested they bury a dead soldier. ""Why? He don't care, and we've got no spade. Leave him for the wolves and wild dogs. Your brothers and mine. First we rob him though.""

Though I had realized how drastically Sandor had changed from when we first saw him till now, I had not realized that there was a scenario that repeated itself for exact comparison. His time with Ray seemed to have solidified some changes we saw him beginning to make while he was ransoming Arya. 

I love how often GoT has managed these scenes where you can see how much someone has grown and changed. It's a great throwback and every single one of these moments really make me smile.",3,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

She even takes off her glimmer at castle black, which I believe was her questioning what magic was actually keeping her young.. or if it was worth it.

The hound: my last example isnt as solid, seeing as he never really believed in any religion. And even mocked the gods on several occasions.

If you think about this you can kind of get some insight as too what GRRM was thinking of the story as a whole.


Now lets say Bran would've never caught Cersie and Jamie in the tower then everything would've gone on like normal and Danny would've eventually taken over the 7 kingdoms and everyone including the Starks would've bent the knee to her. 

If Bran is the NK and he died after falling from the tower then the feud between the Lanisters and Starks would've still went down and all of the events as a whole Ned, Rob, Caitlyn's death, Etc. Danny would've still took the seven kingdom's.

In every scenario Danny would've still more than likely taken the seven kingdoms. Now what was done differently to hault her from doing so and instead fighing the army of the dead? The answer is Bran. If he is the NK and the events between he and the tower never happened, there would be no NK and no reason for Jon to go after the Army of the dead because the WW wouldn't exist just whights. In Jon not going after them because they don't exist then Danny would've never went to fight them too because they are no threat. She has been showing signs that she has a bit of her father in her with some of her unjust ways of ruling foreshadowing that she may not have been a good ruler. If the three eyed raven was sitting, waiting, and pulling strings for years maybe he saw this and decided to help set the events in motion for Bran to be the NK in the most elaborate game of all, because he new what it meant in the end for the seven. 

So why is this important to the overall story and how is it relevant. Because if there was no NK then Jon would've probably never seen the Iron Throne. The whole point of the story is only to stall Danny from the throne so Jon can take his rightful place and it all started with Bran. In the end if you think about it its not about anything else except the game. It's like its all wrote and mean directly for Jon Snow. 

(Side Note:) I believe Jamie is the TPTWP because it all started with him trying to kill Bran, and it will end with him killing Bran/NK like he was suppose to do in the first place. The beginning is the ending.

My friends disagreed, saying the dothraki value power and out of respect and fear of course they would all bow to her. What do you guys think?",22,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm rewatching the series for the Xth time, and I noticed two things:

**1.** For as revered as it seems to be, the trial by combat in which we see Oberyn Martell fight The Mountain was kind of a poorly put together fight sequence. The story behind the fight is fantastic, and everything leading up to it, but with regards to the direction of the fight itself, it seemed sloppy. There were several cuts that took away from the action, most noticeably, Oberyn's showboating (which was awesome nonetheless, and very in line with his character). I just found it kinda peculiar that I'd remembered the fight with such awe, when in reality it was rather basic, in terms of filmmaking and direction.

**2.** The fight between Ned Stark, Howland Reed &amp; Co. and Arthur Dayne &amp; Co. at the Tower of Joy was just...breathtaking. It was, to me, exactly how a fight scene should be done. Specifically, after Dayne's companions are struck down, it's him with two swords against Ned, Howland, and the other two men they're with. The choreography of the fight was beautifully done, with The Sword Of The Morning donning two swords. The direction was absolutely fantastic; long shots caught all of the action without intrusive cuts that take away from what's actually happening.

Those just happen to be the two that come to mind for me at the moment, but I'm curious as to what everyone else's opinion on this is. What do you consider to be the best fight sequence of *Game Of Thrones*, with regards to filmmaking

**Edit**: Let's exclude the *Battle Of The Bastards*, which is obviously a fan favorite, and well deserved, to be sure. It was a masterclass in battle filmmaking. So, beyond the BotB, what do you consider the best?",59,28,False,spoiler,,,,,

Warning: this post contains some GRRM future book comments and clarifications that may apply to the show, and may spoil book readers looking to go forward completely blind. 


So it has largely been accepted that show Viserion is a wight, although what that means for a dragon still remains to be seen...beyond the increased speed and firepower, of course. 

We also have the possibility that Jon himself may be a wight, more specifically a fire wight, as strongly hinted at by GWWM through a comparison to Beric: 
""Poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time hes a little less Beric. His memories are fading, hes got all these scars, hes becoming more and more physically hideous because hes not a living human being anymore. His heart isnt beating, his blood isnt flowing in his veins, hes a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now were getting back to the whole fire and ice thing..."" 

Once again, there is a degree of ambiguity since 1) there is a chance some of that applies to Beric due to the fact that he underwent death and resurrection so many times compared to show Jon's once, 2) this may only apply to book Beric anyway, since Beric is less zombie like in the show than the books, and 3) exactly what transpires with Jon as a fire wight could naturally be different than Beric due to being of Targ descent (assuming the book doesn't diverge at the last moment) and therefore being inherently different...maybe even more if we assume Starks have their own kind of magic/otherwordliness as well, and 4) some of this could be reverseable, for Jon at least, through any number of events. 

Anyway, labels aside, at the very least show Jon experienced death and then resurrection, the latter thanks to the Lord of Light. We are led to believe that Viserion went through the same process, but through the Night King, and is ""powered"" by ice and winter. The Night King doesn't seem too worried about the husk of Viserion, as it is clearly damaged and decaying, while show Jon seems human. We also know he does experience blood flow due to any number of examples, from bleeding during battle to having an erection.

We have Jon, a Targaryen, turned possibly into a fire wight (and at the very least died and was brought back in some fashion), and Viserion, whose destiny has been tied to the Targs and other descendents from old Valyria, possibly turned into a wight powered through winter. Could they be foils to each other? Are they somehow destined to clash? To somehow rescue each other? Is it just more Ice and Fire imagery that GRRM and D&amp;D seem so fond of?

Am I overthinking this due to the extended break?

TL;DR: It seems possible Jon and Viserion are wights, with Jon being a fire wight and Viserion an ice wight, which may lead to some inevitable clash between the two or even a future affinity. Seems thematically appropriate, and demonstrative of the overall Ice and Fire symbolism. ",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Why does Bran, now dissociated from his human self, care about letting Jon know he's Rhaegar Targaryen's son?

I know Bran can't see into the future (at least not yet), so it can't be explained by something along the lines of ""event X in the future requires Jon knowing he's a Targaryen"". 

Why does Bran think there's this overwhelming need for Jon to know he is not a Stark and actually a Targaryen? I don't think it can be explained by Bran caring about the ""rightful heir"" ending up on the throne, since just about everything involving royal lineage is a not-entirely-rational human concern. The characters that cared about the ""rightful heir"" ending up on the Iron Throne were characters like Ned Stark, Stannis Baratheon, etc. Bran's entire character has revolved around the threat of the White Walkers. How will Jon knowing he's a Targaryen help with that threat?

What does Bran think Jon will gain from suddenly discovering that his entire identity is a lie?

I honestly can't offer plausible answers to these questions without resorting to something like ""Bran is God and knows the endgame and Jon being King is endgame"". But that hasn't quite been established.

I have had a theory of sorts developing for a while and although I have never threw too much weight behind it I thought I would give us a break from the cosplays and bar men that resemble Ser Davos (they have a beard) and try and put my thoughts into word and see how it is received. I am in no way hell bent on this but I will defend my theory where I can, but as I don't want confirmation bias to be an issue I welcome critics of the theory. How else would we be able to explore it. 

The religions of Planetos are always discussed but generally most put religion in this world in the same bracket as our own, more superstition that real powers at work. So first of all I will look at one religion that does seem to have real powers at work. 

* Old God's as the Northmen call it. Wargs, Weirwoods, voices in the air it all sounds mad but we know for a fact that the Weirwood trees are a real network in which the Greenseers can almost travel through time. This is the religion of the North but we know it is not so much a religion but the interpretation of magic by the Northerners, the Children of the Forest, the 3ER and now Bran are a testimony to this as we know that the weirwoods are sacred to the Children and to men and they are a way for Bran to enact his powers and help in his struggle to be ready for the Great war. That is clearly the purpose of Bran, to be ready for the Great War which is evident in the new season as he has lost his humanity and only focuses on his 'time travel' clearly this is Bran's main purpose it is him who is to stop the Night King. Other notable figures in this 'religion' are Brynden Rivers and Jojen Reed. Both of these characters had the sight and more importantly both were destined to meet Bran and both were essential in helping to prepare him for his mission, so much so that each of these men gave their life quite willingly as long as it ensured Bran progressed to the next step. So even though these men have the ability to see they clearly acknowledge that **Bran is the most powerful of them and his mission is essential to saving the world.**

* Staying North of the Wall, this is not so much a religion but a real power and as it follows on well from the Old God's I will mention them next, the White Walkers. In the book we hear of the Great Other, in the show we have the Night King, the embodiment of death and the leader of the White Walkers who obviously has powers as he has displayed them many times by now such as his QB throw with an ice spear, apparent Greensight and the great power of reanimation. This is the antagonist power of the show with the eternal link to ice, the weapon of the Children gone wrong. This is basically all I can say on the WW for now as we will need some answers in the new season or the winds of winter(LOL) to shed light on the true nature of ice creatures. 

* The Seven - these God's seem to me as the least powerful of any God on the show and are really just interpretation of real world feelings, they match up with a lot of other polytheist religions of the ancient world in the way they are representations of fertility, war, death and other common real world issues. They are like the Roman Gods who are praised in the same style as the Christian real world God. 

* In this series where there is ice there must surely be fire, so I will go next to the mysterious God who has never appeared, has no real world representation except his priests but has shown actual true powers to exist, R'hllor. What do we know about the Lord of Light or from here on in LOL, well we know that he has priests who are enacting his work some of whom are powerless but some who seem to posses real power. Looking at his two main priests firstly with Thoros of Myr, we know that Thoros brought Beric back from the dead and in the books Beric was able to pass this life on to Lady Stoneheart but let's deal with the show for now. Melisandre is our foremost character who is linked to the LOL, the Lord has brought her to Westeros to help make way for the Prince that Was Promised. We know that Mel works of visions and voices from her Lord that aren't always easy to follow e.g. the Stannis fuck up, however the important thing to note is that she knew to tell Stannis that his goal was not only the throne but to travel North and help fight the wildlings and then to take back Winterfell so that the North was united. The most notable moment of Mel's is without doubt bringing Jon back from the dead, we know that she has no real power but for whatever reason she was able to bring Jon back from the dead, but how? Why? How can these two powerless priests be so special. My answer to that links heavily with GRRM stating that Jon and Beric (therefore LSH also) are fire wights. Now this was very specific terminology, he makes it clear that they are wights just like the what the army of the Night King or Great Other is filled with but these ones are fire wights, the army of the living. This clearly identifies the LOL as the opposite to the NK, he has made moves to counter the White Walkers, who else does that? **Bran Stark**. 

Looking at some other characters who have had interactions with the Lord of Light or his priests/esses, The Hound seen the arrow head mountain which was pivotal in the story, he travelled there with the Brotherhood (Thoros &amp; Beric), these men wen to the arrow head mountian with Jon who was already in high regard with the LOL and Gendry who is another one of our characters to experience the LOL. Varys heard something in the fire that changed his life forever, we are not sure what it was that was said but we do know that he played a huge part in Dany being fully equipped to take over Westeros, however it is clear that her main purpose for now is to fight the White Walkers and without her the living would fail so it seems that Varys life goal has coincidentally put a huge army in the North in time for the NK invasion, I am not saying that was Varys true goal but the voice that spoke to him, possibly (I will leave out mention of Aegon for the most part, but again a representation of fire). Stannis saved Jon Snow's life and made sure the wall would be defended a while longer so even though he was not our saviour he played a huge role in helping Jon. We also know the Mad King heard voices who many speculate is Bran and they were tied to fire, ""burn them all"". Arya, Tyrion, Euron (in the books), Sam, Brienne and others also experience the Lord of Light in their own minor ways, all of which are in the right place at the right time for the Great War. One more point on this is that Jon, Arya, Brienne and Sam are all in the North with Valyrian Steel. Jon is obviously essential to the LOL whether he likes it or not, Jon is seemingly our hero and the one man actively trying to turn everyone's attention away from petty bullshit and towards the Night King, he brought Wildings South, encountered the Night King, Took Winterfell and United the North and added 3 dragons to his cause and the Dragon Queen. This level of dedication to the fight against the WW is unseen in any character and in any God, except Bran and the Old God's. 

For me this is too coincidental that two powerful entities are working together to get the living ready for the dead, my counter argument and point of my theory is that they are not different they are the exact same and they are both Bran Stark interpreted in different ways. I believe Bran spoke in the flames to Varys, showed the Hound the arrow mountain, whispered to the Mad King and somehow brought Jon and Beric back from the dead. 

So humour me for now and say I am right, that would mean through the old God's Bran has been able to travel through time and whisper to people and as we know he can change time in certain ways. I theorise that Bran knows this and he knows how things must be for the living to win. He needed someone to help the dragon queen get to Westeros, he needed the Son of Rhaegar and Lyanna to be the PTWP and do all the things Jon did, he needed the 7 to go beyond the wall (for whatever reason I will let DnD answer that), he seemingly needs the VS weapons to be in the North and in the hands of certain characters. My thoughts are that Bran is the main power in this world, he as the most powerful Greenseer is the champion of the Living against the dead, his nemesis the Night King or as the books say the Great Other. Azor Ahai is the champion of the LOL to fight the Great Other, just as Jon is the champion of Bran to defeat the Night King. Bran I believe is one and the same with the Old Gods and R'hallor and that R'hallor is an interpretation of humans of the signs and voices which Bran (or maybe greenseers preparing the way for him) which has been thought of as the work of a God or in the Mad King's case thought of as just madness. 

I will explore one more religion before I go and it was a certain someone's (hehe) link to it which got the ball rolling about this theory. That someone is no one, Arya. Now this theory as I will call it for lack of a better term all started when Bran handed Catspaw to Arya, Bran made it quite clear he is not human anymore before this moment and this human touch of giving his sister a lovely present isn't really consistent. But he didn't give it to her as a present he gave it to her as he knows that at this point in time she needed to receive this dagger and as with everything else for Bran he knows it is essential in the Great War to come. That left me with a little feeling that it will be Arya who in the end will kill the NK, she already has a perfectly good and famous sword so why give her VS? She will kill at very very very least a White Walker but humour me again and agree with me it is the tool used to kill the Night King and win the war, it would make sense that Bran handed it to her but it would also salvage Arya's seeming wasted time in Essos. 

Arya needs to kill the Night King, so to get to the most well protected entity in the World she would need to be a master assas..... yeah you know where I am going with this. Bran I believe is a God in many cultures so you could say a many faced God. Jaqen H'gar mysteriously ended up close to Arya in captivity, he showed special interest in her, he gave her a coin, he trained her and he let her go but more importantly he let her go without any consequences which is strangely lenient. Many have complained about this plot hole and say that it makes Arya's story line seem wasted but if you take my word for it for arguments sake we know that Jaqen prays to the many faced God and that God talks back to him, these voices have demanded certain deaths that may be pivotal over the years but for once the many faced God could have told Jaqen to go to Westeros, train a girl, let her rediscover herself and then let her leave as a master assassin capable of killing the Night King and winning the war for the living. 

I know there are a lot of details to iron out, a lot of source work I can still work through and lot's more welcome criticsm before I can ever consider this a true theory. But I want to put this out there first and see how it is picked up by some of yourselves and I welcome you all to pick it apart and question it because that is the only way I will know myself if this holds any water. I will defend my theory where I can but am open minded to criticism and basically want to see if I am on to something or else just having major withdrawal. Thanks for reading. 

TL:DR - Bran Stark has been going through time to show signs, speak to people and move the chess pieces to ensure the living are ready to fight and beat the dead. These signs and voices etc. have been interpreted by humans as the works of God's, essentially making Bran the Old Gods and the New, the Lord of Light and the Many Faced God in his bid to defeat the Night King and ensure the survival of the living.

She looks in distress and clearly calls for help. Out of sudden she can hear Drogon's scream, and he comes and rescues her. What I find fascinating is how Drogon came into the play, a huge fire bursted into the air and he came out of nowhere, which makes me wanna ask, can dragons teleport from one place to another using fire ?

They are both two of the biggests characters in their universe and one of them had their face burnt and it is a defining part of their character.

You can also stretch out this dumb theory a little more with the idea that Sandor might be a grave digger and of course so is the Undertaker.

Thing is The Game of Thrones came out a year before Kane became a character in the WWF. But A Clash of Kings came out after. It has been a long time since I read the books so I don't recall which book Sandor's backstory was filled out.

544,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-4-10,2018,4,10,4,8b14ay,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] - The Faceless Man's religion and philosophy appears to be lies. Otherwise the plot makes no sense. Here is my take on how and why.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8b14ay/spoilers_the_faceless_mans_religion_and/,bitchspaghetti,1523301364,"**The Faceless Men are trained to relinquish their former identities and become ""no one"", which allows them to become entirely different people, all in service to the Many-Faced God. They also believe that, as servants of death, they must serve above all else and that they must deliver upon certain people the ""gift"" of death.**

This philosophy in my view is deceptive at best and is tied into the ""Game of Faces."" 
You cannot willingly become an empty husk. You have to always have one identity at any time. Sort of a root identity. However you must learn to be an empty vessel when needed to carry many faces, along with many identities successfully and lie about it well. Observe how the Waif and Jaque hold on to such jarring individualistic personalities and emotions even though they are both no one. You have to discover this on your own through the Game of Faces.
Remember that there are two skills needed to be successful in the Game of Faces and to become a Faceless Man. 

a)	You must learn through observing clues if someone is speaking the truth or a lie.

b)	You must also be able to successfully lie without revealing any clues that will uncover your deception.

Throughout the entire plot Arya was hit by the Waif whenever she said, ""A girl is no one."" When questioned about her identity. This is a lie all the way as you cannot be completely no one.  But the objective is to belief in yourself that you are a no one in order to take upon a new identity. When you change back you will always retain some sort of root identity and generally your original self. If you can fool a well-trained servant of God (a master of deception) that you are a no one, then you are ready to become no one. But your identity does not completely disappear.
___________
**""Death holds no sweetness in this house. We are not warriors, nor soldiers, nor swaggering bravos puffed up with pride. We do not kill to serve some lord, to fatten our purses, to stroke our vanity. We never give the gift to please ourselves. Nor do we choose the ones we kill. We are but servants of the God of Many Faces.""**

This also completely contradicts what is actually observed and is a lie to be discovered. It is clearly shown that the Waif had a personal resentment towards Arya. The Waif has repeatedly shown wanting to harm and kill Arya. At the end, she was permitted by Jaqen H Ghar himself to carry her task of killing off Arya as a personal desire. Jaqens only request was to make it painless. Arya discovers this after killing the Waif.

I believe that when you are a trainee, you kill as you are ordered to. You do not change course and get distracted or have your emotions get in the way of a mission at hand. You do not steal a mask to run your personal errand. This is where Arya failed once again. However I believe that once you have become no one, you are also given the freedom to choose your victim as long as it is under the blessings of The God of Many Faces and does not get in the way of your service to the God of Many Faces.

At the end Arya understands that she has her root identity and personal choices. She came out victorious killing the Waif, a well-trained assassin. And she picked up on the contradiction thus now a master in the Game of Faces and emerges as a no one.

At the final goodbye in Braavos, Arya holds The Needle to Jaques throat and said,

Arya: You told her to kill me.

Jaque: Yes, but there she is, and there you are. Finally, a girl is no one.

Arya: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and I'm going home.

Jaque nods in approval. Arya marches out to kill all the Freys and continues her mission that is her list.

It may be early, as I've just finished the finale of season 7, but dare I say this is new favorite show of all time.

So many incredible moments! From the Red Wedding (which totally caught me off guard), Joffery's bitchass dying, Ramsay's bitch ass dying.

The season 6 finale when the Sept blew up. Fuck there's so much epic stuff.

I see now why my friends were dying waiting for season 8... I really need to put more people I know irl on this so I can talk about it more!

In the books, during his meeting with Stannis, Renly laughs and jokes about Stannis' letter claiming that. He calls it a clever move and jokes about the Lannister retaliation of claiming that Stannis sent his fool to service his wife. The way he talks about it, it seems like he sees it as a political ploy to legitimize Stannis' own claim. Which would indicate he didn't know about it and that he finds it hard to believe. 

On the other hand, its not in his political interest to acknowledge Stannis' legitimacy during this parley. By hinting that Stannis is as full of crap as him, he is kind of putting them on the same level and trying to make it about who has a bigger army instead of who has the better claim. 

*So while his statements hint that he didn't know, they don't prove it.* 


Take the other side now - a year ago, Renly was trying to get Margaery in Robert's bed. He showed Ned a picture of Marg and asked if she looked like Lyanna - clearly hoping that the resemblance would re-ignite Robert's passion for lost love. But resemblance to Lyanna would clearly not be enough. Robert wasn't going to simply discard Cersei - not when it'd such a great insult to House Lannister - and I doubt Mace would've settled for Margaery being Robert's mistress. Not to mention, even if Robert sets Cersei aside, Joffrey and Tommen would still in in line for throne ahead of any sons by Marg. Given that, the Tyrell hold on the throne won't be secure and once again, I doubt the Tyrells would've settled for that. 

IF Renly knew, then this plan would make sense. Once he has made sure that Robert is interested in Margaery, he can reveal Cersei's infidelity, get her, Jaime and the kids all killed, make sure Tywin can't do anything about it and then conveniently marry Robert to Marg. And ofcourse, Marg would raise her kids to love their ""Uncle Renly"" who, in due time, would be named regent or Hand and rule in all but name. 

But ofcourse, this isn't the only possible plan. Renly might've planned on Cersei being poisoned or the children having convenient accidents. Or he simply might not have thought that far ahead. Maybe his goal was just to get Robert to fall for Margaery and figure out the rest later. 


*Once again, this part hints that Renly knew, but it doesn't prove it.*


So what do you think? Did Renly know or not? And why do you think that?",18,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

No, not Joffrey. No, not Cerci. The character I hate the most in Game of Thrones is Khaleesi and self declared Queen of the Seven Realms, Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. Entitled, sadistic, and generally despicable are some of the words I would use to describe her, and it baffles me as to why some people would think that she is a morally good character (all of this is coming from a guy whose favorite characters include Tywin Lannister, Petyr Baelish, and Cerci) 
Id like to start a list of her many terrible actions.   I wish I was more familiar with the books, though sadly my knowledge is mostly limited to the show. Feel free to add to this list in the comments.

Season 1: shes relatively harmless in season one, though I think the seeds of her true nature are planted here. For one, she falls in love with Khal Drogo, a bloodthirsty killer and rapist who has been the direct cause of thousands of deaths. Her ability to overlook this little personality fault is a good sign that she is open to the prospect as well. 

Season 2: After dragging a few loyal followers to near death in the red wastes, Daenerys marches up to the 13 of Quarth and demands that they let her into their city. For the rest of the season, she continues to demand that the 13 pay for her fleet and refuses to sacrifice anything in return. By the end of the season, she has burned a man alive with a smile on her face and let another man and a woman she had known since episode 1 die in agony trapped in a safe. And all of this was in the name of her precious little children that she deserves to have so much. 

Just stared season 3 so Ill have more later, but here are some random things I remember

Basically embodying the worst aspects of imperialism and totalitarianism (all this coming from a person who doesnt hate either institution when used properly) 

Generally assuming that everything is hers by right, despite how little shes proven to deserve it by virtue.

Being a terrible Queen of Mareen.

Burning hundreds of Lannister Soldiers alive in the Field of Fire 2.0.

Burning the Tarleys alive for not swearing fealty to her. 

Dragging hundreds of slave soldiers across the world because they had nothing else to live for when she offered them their freedom.

Friend-Zoning a man who deserves much better than her

Banging several men who deserve better than her

Banging her nephew who deserves better than her

And more as I keep watching

Most people think its Jon's Sword Longclaw but im convinced 100% that it's Widowswail and Oathkeeper together and here's why. 

- GRRM got the idea of the whole story from the idea of a little boy seeing a beheading and finding direwolves. I'm not GRRM but how can you come up with this whole elaborate story just by this thought. Well I think Neds sword gave him the idea. Ned's sword was called ""ICE"" The title is ""A Song Of Fire and ICE"". So that means that sword is the most important piece of the plot. Stay with me on this.

- Now They made ice being melted down an opening scene for season 4 so its a huge deal. It made what we know as ""Oathkeeper and Widowswail"". Jamie has one and brieanne had the other. 

- I think to make LightBringer you have to forge them back together again to remake ""ICE"". 

- It's either going to be Jon or Jamie that will kill the NK in my opinion, but which one is the better candidate and which one works best for the story. Well they both do. 

- If Jon takes ""ICE"" and stabs it into Danny which is ""FIRE"" then it creates ""LightBringer"" which will be the way to kill the NK and end the long night. Breaking down the name of the new sword you could say It will ""BRING"" ""LIGHT"" to end the long night since we know most of the battle scenes are going to be dark. You could also say it could ""BRING"" the Lord of ""LIGHT"" when forged and he will save humanity.

- Now this works for Jamie too if he uses Widowswail combined with oaktheeper to kill Cersie. The key is in the wording ""WIDOW"" which is what Cersie is, and ""WAIL"" which is what she will do when the sword is plunged into her and ""OATHKEEPER"" because the oath to protect the stark girls is fully accomplished when Cersie is killed and Jamies story will go into full on redemption for himself. This will create ""LIGHTBRINGER"" because it was forged into the heart of someone he loved for the ultimate sacrifice. He will then be the one to kill the NK. 





It could be either one of them but im convinced you have to forge these two swords back together to make Lightbringer.

However, I think Bran's already made a decision - he's going to keep this information to himself so long as Jaime helps their cause. The issue will probably come up, but in the context of Jaime apologizing to Bran without prompting or Bran confronting Jaime privately.

Given that Bran's 3ER knowledge appears to encompass every event in history (at least on the show, if not in the books), it's safe to assume he knows who shoved him and why. It's also safe to assume that his injuries have come up in conversation with his sisters, since the Starks appeared to have planned for Bran's testimony about the assassin and the dagger during Littlefinger's trial.

They charged Littlefinger with, among other things, instigating the conflict between the Starks and Lannisters by having Lysa falsely accuse the Lannisters of poisoning Jon Arryn and falsely claiming the dagger that Catelyn brought to King's Landing belonged to Tyrion. The Stark-Lannister conflict escalated to open hostility and violence as a result of Catelyn taking Tyrion prisoner. 

Bran left out a big part of that story. Catelyn was easily convinced that Tyrion hired someone to kill her son because she was *already* convinced that the Lannisters had tried and failed to kill Bran by throwing him off of the tower. And that, of course, was Jaime's fault. This wasn't solely the result of the letter about Jon Arryn - Catelyn grew suspicious after finding a long blonde hair inside the tower.  Catelyn knew better than take a Lannister prisoner based solely on Littlefinger's word. Littlefinger identifying the knife as Tyrion's only served to confirm her existing belief that the Lannisters tried to murder Bran.

If Jaime hadn't shoved Bran (an act which was clearly unplanned and not connected to Littlefinger's scheming), Littlefinger wouldn't have had the opportunity to orchestrate Bran's attempted murder and frame the Lannisters. Had this not happened, there would only have been the letter to generate conflict. Catelyn gave some credence to Lysa's claims, but she definitely wasn't inclined to throw caution to the wind and take someone prisoner based only on that message. Ned was also clearly not inclined to confront the Lannisters without additional evidence. Lysa didn't have the best reputation in terms of sanity or stability, so anything she wrote had to be taken with a grain of salt.

Jaime shoving Bran also helped Ned connect the dots about Cersei and Jaime's affair and the illegitimacy of Cersei's children, since the most logical explanation was that Bran witnessed something he shouldn't have when he climbed the tower. And of course, learning the truth about Robert's so-called heirs was what motivated Ned to conspire against Cersei and Joffrey when Robert died.

Everything Bran said about Littlefinger was correct, but it was only half of the truth. Sansa, Arya, and the rest of the North don't seem to know that, which means one of the following happened:

* **Bran denied having any memory of his fall from the tower.** I think Sansa or Arya would be skeptical of this, given that he can see every other thing that ever happened. Arya might suspect he was hiding something in order to prevent her from seeking revenge.


* **Bran told them Jaime did it but somehow persuaded Sansa and Arya not to react to this information.** Weeks after Bran arrived at Winterfell, Sansa encouraged Brienne to go to King's Landing by assuring her that Jaime, who treated her honorably before, would be present. Maybe she'd have strategically withheld this information from Brienne so Brienne wouldn't derail the truce by confronting Jaime, but I don't think Sansa would have gone out of her way to compliment him if she knew. I *really* doubt anyone could convince Arya to ignore what Jaime did for the sake of diplomacy. She'd have been furious that she had an opportunity to kill him while he was at the Twins but didn't take it. Arya would have tried to get word to Jon before the armistice negotiations or told Brienne before she left for KL or raged at Sansa for not immediately putting a bounty on Jaime's head or done *something* to express her anger.


* **Bran's fall never came up, so he never had reason to mention it.** Also seems unlikely, since they appear to have discussed the origins of the Stark-Lannister conflict with Bran before Littlefinger's trial.


* **Bran claimed his fall was accidental.** This would weaken any claim Bran made later about Jaime shoving him and call into question any future claims Bran makes based on his visions. If he's portraying the fall as an accident now, he'll continue doing so. Right now, everyone seems inclined to trust Bran's visions. If he intends to convince people that R + L = J, he needs to maintain his credibility. The book Sam found only accounted for Lyanna's marriage, not her pregnancy or the identity of her child.


Deciding whether or not to disclose Jaime's actions wasn't critical to convicting Littlefinger, but there's been no indication whatsoever that Bran has shared this information outside the trial either. 

It wouldn't have tipped off Littlefinger to reveal this information while they conspired against him, either. If anything, it might have helped the Starks. The belief that Bran was injured by a Lannister is the entire reason Littlefinger was able to frame Tyrion for the attempted murder. Confirming Jaime's involvement could have reassured Littlefinger that the Starks still trusted his version of events - that Tyrion hired an assassin to finish the job for his siblings.

Bran must also know that Jaime is en route to Winterfell as of the season finale. If his intention to punish Jaime, he's not going to wait until Jaime is at their gate to share this information with Sansa. He'd warn her, so she can prepare for his arrival. Jaime is still a deadly fighter, and it makes no sense to charge him with attempted murder without a plan in place to contain him. Bran may be able to see Jaime's intentions now, but he can't predict with certainty how Jaime will react when cornered.

We won't know for sure until next season, but I think Bran's already made up his mind. He hasn't necessarily forgiven Jaime (maybe he's keeping the secret so he can threaten to tell the entire North who crippled him if Jaime betrays them for Cersei), but he's not going to drop the bomb immediately, either.

EDIT: It's also interesting that, during the trial, the Starks explicitly attributed the entire Stark-Lannister conflict to Littlefinger's scheming, with all the Northern lords as witnesses to this claim. It's possible that Bran deliberately pushed a narrative favorable to the Lannisters when sharing his visions, laying the groundwork for cooperation with both Tyrion (who abandoned House Lannister and would be slightly more palatable to the North as a result) *and* Jaime (who never cast aside his association with the Lannister family - only with Cersei). Rather than ""the Lannisters are the enemy and Tyrion is the exception,"" the attitude of House Stark is shifting toward ""the Lannisters are our allies and Cersei is the exception.""",33,44,False,spoiler,,,,,

Even if theres other candidates, for the sake of the argument Im going to assume that its going to be Jon.

The way you forge the sword is by first quenching it in water, then the heart of a lion, then the heart of your loved one.

Jon already quenches the sword in water when he went north of the wall and fell in that lake. He is still missing a lion and his loved one.

The lion will be Tyrion. Remember the ominous tones of the ending of this season. Were not sure why Tyrion what Tyrion spoke about with Cersei, but it prompted him to look at Jon and Dannys sexy time with a sort of dread. I believe this will eventually cause Jon to kill Tyrion due to Tyrion betraying Danny. 

It sounds far fetched, but lets see the other options, Jaime and Cersei. Cersei does by Jaimes hand, obviously. I dont see why Jon would possibly kill Jaime after that. Nor do i see Jon killing Cersei. 

Lastly, Jon kills Danny when shes killed and turned into a white.

I figure it took some awfully strong blood magic to make the night King. It would take some awfully strong blood magic to kill him. And I'm thinking that probably more than anything else he wants to be free from that half death that the children of the forest stuck him with.  

Maybe he was not defeated that last long night.  Maybe he learned that it would take a kings blood to break the magic, and not any King, but one born of fire and ice.  So maybe he retreated on the promise that when a suitable king was born he would be freed. 

And the North should have remembered this promise, but they forgot.  Maybe Bran built the wall and Winterfell knowing they would never sacrifice a king.   Still, have to keep a Stark in Winterfell, just in case, cuz the promised prince must share the Night Kings Stark blood.  

So for 8000 years he sleeps, maybe waking up occasionally when you thinks it perhaps a suitable King has arrived only to retreat again when he realizes that King will not do, bringing with him relatively short Winters.  

  And now that a perfect a king is alive and the north has forgotten their promise, he is a little annoyed and intends to take down the North, and maybe the rest of the world, before taking his promised king, and ultimately his own life.  

Not to say Jon has to be sacrificed , battle blood may be enough.  Dany or boat baby may suffice.  Night King may just bare his chest to Jon or Jamie, Nissa Nissa style.    Hard to guess, but I think that this ""Prince that was promised"" line has been thrown around too much let it simply be the stereotypical hero-king with a magical sword.  ",11,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Do you think they might've preserved his bones for future purpose? 


I think it might be a common practice among the Westerosi nobility to preserve the bones of even their enemies just in case they needed to use them in future dealings. Ned died a traitor's death, but even so, the Lannisters preserved his bones which Tyrion later offered to Catelyn as a good will gesture. Joffrey wanted to command Walder Frey to send him Robb's head - which atleast implies that Frey keeping it preserved would've been a reasonable expectation. Supposedly being a cautious man, Walder Frey might've decided to store Robb's body somewhere after his sons had had their fun just in case he has to deal with any Stark loyalists in the future. But ofcourse, he didn't bother to do the same thing with Catelyn - so who knows?


I'm not sure why it bothers me so much, but I feel like the bones being brought to the final resting place and put to peace is an important rite of mourning. It kind of gives a sense of closure - as if despite how horribly a character may have died, he is finally at peace. That Robb would be denied even that while characters like Joffrey and Tywin get state funerals seems really unsettling. The books make a big deal about this stuff too - its not just Ned, first Lady's bones are sent back to Winterfell and then so are the bones of Jory and others that Jaime's men killed in King's Landing. In fact, in his peace terms, Robb makes a point of not only asking for Ned's remains but those of his household who died as well - and he asks for them before asking for Ice. That Robb's character would be denied the catharsis of this simple courtesy seems really unsatisfying as a narrative. 


In the books, I'm hoping for a scene where after House Frey falls (and fall it must), whoever took it down finds Robb's remains and sends them North under escort. And later, another scene after Winterfell is retaken where a statue of Robb is being built for the crypts. I was expecting something similar from the show, but the show only seems to remember Robb when its time to point out how dumb he was for being betrayed and losing the war. And for the past couple of seasons, Catelyn's existence seems to have been reduced to ""mother to the Stark children"" and ""Littlefinger's character motivation"". So I don't think I can expect anything from the show.


But what about the books? You think there is hope there?",22,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

BLACKWATER

Sansa: But we have guards to defend us?

Cersei: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, theyll be the first ones out of the doors.

In S7, Cersei mentions hiring the Golden Company to 'retrieve some things that belong to her'.

THE SPOILS OF WAR

Sansa: You shouldnt have run from the guards.

Arya: I didnt run. You need better guards.

BEYOND THE WALL

Sansa: I will not set foot in Kings Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen. If they want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me.

Brienne: Its not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.

Sansa: I have many guards who would happily imprison him or behead him, whether or not youre here.

Brienne: And you trust their loyalty? You trust he hasnt been speaking to them all behind your back?

""BEYOND THE WALL""

Daenerys: ""So if all goes well I will finally get to meet your sister"", ""from everything you told me about her, she would rather murder me than speak with me"",

Im not sure how this will play out in the finale, but its something I could see happening as Cersei is power hungry and will always want to be on the winning side. I think her child being sacrificed would really amplify that need. Cerseis only redeeming quality is her love for her children; I think her sacrificing her last child for power would be a huge downward spiral for the arch of Cersei Lannister. I think this will cause Jamie to kill Cersei for sacrificing his son; becoming the Queenslayer in the process.

Ned talks with Bran after the beheading and during his archery, Ned talks to Jon when they both leave Winterfell, Ned talks to both Sansa and Arya but do we ever actually see Ned talk with Robb?  I went looking through the first few episodes again and they never seem to have direct words with each other.  

Did I miss a small convo or did the father and his first born son never actually exchange words in this story?  Given what Robb does as a result of what happens to Ned I thought there would be at least 1 scene where they talk to each other but I can't find one.

Do they ever talk to each other directly in the books?  Is this just an oddity or could it possibly have deeper meaning?",22,56,False,spoiler,,,,,

There are many ideas. I thought I put my own. 

The idea: the NK wants to fight Lord of the light (LL).

1.  Fire and ice are enemies to eachother. Fire is symbolised in LL and ice is symbolised in NK. (Why we haven't seen LL? I don't know. But could be that Lord of the light is not an accurate translation and ""lord"" has no gender in its original language? If yes, could it be Melisandre? Her father? Or he is just a deity. If yes, NK's god or deity must also be there. I guess ""death"" is god of NK and his army. Death is also arya's god.)

2. Two swords are going to be in the last scene: the ice and the lightbringer.  This is interesting and confusing: ice is the sword of house stark and (almost surely) NK is related to house stark. But lightbringer is about Azor Ahai who ""comes back"".  People say: Azor Ahai will be Jon Snow. Maybe or maybe not. 

3. The GoT must end and its LL and NK must ""put aside [their] enmity"". I guess a resolution (a ""song"" a peace agreement) can be like this:  the ice will be reforged and becomes the lightbringer: Azor Ahai (jon snow?) puts the ice into heart of Nissa Nissa (danny? someone from south? Arya stark? ). Nissa Nissa dies. Lightbringer is born. This sword must ""bring light"". Bran role is unclear here. 

Crazy things can happen: 

either something like light appears and finishes off NK.

Or: NK wants the ice (his old sword maybe?). He gets it and take Bran stark to kings landing and kill cersei. Bran dies and NK goes back to where he came from. Or something like that. 

Or: Bran is actually LL (unlikely) and he will be going into ghost and fights Nk.",38,28,False,spoiler,,,,,

They all laugh, because the Aegon they know of lived and died, with no such events transpiring. We now know that Jon's real name is Aegon Targaryen. Perhaps he is the Aegon this seer was referring to? Or maybe he is just a madman after all. It stuck with me as a detail that was sort of highlighted in the scene, which D&amp;D often do to subtly foreshadow events to come. Perhaps this could foreshadow the impending consequences of the betrayal by the Cersei/Euron alliance. Maybe not. Thoughts?

A good show should have some mystery or unpredictable changes to me. 

GOT is predictable in the sense that someone is going to get their head chopped and on to the next one and i dont care who it is. So maybe i missing to point and someone can point to the interesting part here. The story seems like the most plain and typical  ""soup opera"" you could find .. just polished with more gore and violence. Its like the writers just took 2-3 family drama and just twisted and turned it with ""throne"" to make it more ""interesting"". The story is slow af way to much useless chit-chat, i mean i am in the second season aqd  Daenerys still hasnt arrived but is starving in desert, and Khal Drogo fell ill and died from what was originally a self inflicted wound while acting bad ass, thats just ridiculously stupid where i have to laugh.  Most of the characters lack facial expression and just come across dumb. And the acting lets just say non of the cast is impressive, except maybe some of the Lannisters at times. There is really no good game changing cliffhangers making you want to turn on the next eposide. I do respect that everyone has a taste but hope some can tell me if i can except some changes giving my view so far. I really do hope so cause its just beautiful to watch GOT.

Is the only excitement about GOT who is next to get their head chopped off ? What about if i dont care about non of the characters ?

Sorry but Tyrion is a handsome little shit in the show and his scar is cool. In the book he's a monster and the scar makes him look mpre hideous because he loses his nose. Same with Brienne. She's *realllllllly* ugly in the books but I think Brienne in the show  (minus her haircut) is very pretty and has a great butt. In the books she's hideous....

I think their ugliness is important. Handsome faces are easily trusted because of their attraction. Peter Dinklage has a handsome face, but Tyrion has a disgusting face and people don't trust him because he's so ugly and monstrous. I hate that this translation was lost in the books

Also the actual throne itself in the books is 1000000x more badass than the one in the show (Google it). I understand the cost and storage of a throne like that in the books is impossible, but I suppose that is the beauty of books. Limitless imagination can be put into effect with no budget in a book, where in a show it would cost tons",49,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

I like to think that, the peace treaty was

1. Between the Night king (NK) and the Lord of the light (LL).

2. And it partioned the world into North (for NK) and South (for LL). 

3. As gestures: NK gave his heart to LL and LL gave his sword (the ICE). 

4. Targaryen were protecting LL interest. And Starks were protecting NK interest. Starks men must not march south (else they die) and Targaryans must not march north (else they die). And I think it was LL who violated the treaty: he marched north with his army led by his followers. And NK decided to march south. 

 A marriage between a stark and a targaryan was a solution or a problem? 

**A** if solution: the son of that marriage is the next NK. Current NK need a replacement, who better than Jon? So NK wants to crown Jon and that's all.

Or is it as usual: a targaryan sitting on the throne (Jon) and a stark as warden of the north (bran? Bran could be next blood raven too).

For future NK, a targaryan man and a woman are needed, so danny and jon did secure survical of Targaryans. Bran role is unclear.

**B** if prolem: I see no problem.

I wonder,why is that? Because If one is constantly called dwarf,eunuch or bastard and despised,it is more understandable that they becomes twisted or bad person.If I were them,I probably wouldn't care about the realm or don't save people.

It's because in out times it is politically and socially not accepted to depict the once-descriminated as bad ? Or,it's because the author just don't like traditional point of view? Or,it's beceuse they are just good intrinsicly(I think this is poor reasoning)? Or,it's because they have good friends/family? Or,it's just plot twist? Or,am I missing something?

but however instead I decided to instead make a post on who I think is going to die since not enough people posted on the other post and to be honest it take me to long to tally all the results. So here we go:

- All of Dany's Dragons (Drogon is killed by Viserion, Undead Viserion falls once the NK falls, Rhaegal is consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- All the Greyjoys (Yara is mercy killed by Theon, Damphair is executed by Euron, Theon dies killing Euron)

- Tormund, Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce and most of the Northern Lords (die in the first battle against the WW's)

- Beric (gives Gendry the kiss of life)

- Mel (killed by the NK)

- Qyburn (consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- The Mountain (Cleganebowl)

- The Hound (Bloodlose after Cleganebowl)

- Bronn (killed by the Mountain)

- Varys (consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- Harry Strickland (consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- Cersei (killed by Jaime)

- Jaime (sacrifices himself saving KL by setting of the wildfire and killing the Wights entering the city, basically consumed by wildfire)

- Brienne (consumed by wildfire)

- NK (killed by Jon in 1v1)

- Dany (survives childbirth but dies in battle with the NK)

- Edd and the Night's watch (the rest of the wall falls on them)

- Howland Reed (killed by the NK)

One character I am not sure on:

- Sansa Stark (I want her to live but I just keep thinking she will die next season)

The characters I think will live (or atleast sure will live):

Jon Snow, Bran Stark, Arya Stark, Nymeria and the Wolfpack, Davos, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, Edmure, Roslin, Edmure's child, Meera Reed, Lyanna Mormont, Missendei, Tyrion, Robin, Pod, Gendry, Jon &amp; Dany's twin children, Timett, Jaqen, Daario, the Archmaesters, the Tarly woman, Jorah, and Hot Pie.",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Remember that horrible plot in s07e06: ""Beyond the Wall""?

My theory involves a twist that would make you think again about that plot, and about the genuinity of Tyrion's intelligence!

Tyrion's plan all along, was, after believing Jon Snow, to give him a chance to bring a sample from behind the wall. His goal was not to convince Cersei, but rather to convince ""Daenerys"". Because if the dead are real, then Daenerys should send her armies north, because they are a very serious threat that must be stopped for the survival of entire Westeros.

With that being typed, Tyrion is not a fool. He **did not** actually bet on succeeding at arranging a meeting with Cersei. That was a side-goal to hit two birds with one stone, because if Cersei agrees to meet them and accept a truce, her betrayal would be very predictable and used to Daenery's advantage to overtake King's Landing smoothly without blooshed.

(Possibly hiding a portion of the armies somewhere to march in King's Landing after Cersei marches out to finish what's left of the White Walker's Battle). ",61,330,False,spoiler,,,,,

In other circumstances, we have actually seen what was going on, in addition to being told: for instance, Tyrion telling Daenerys &amp; Co about the siege of Casterly Rock (S7E3). I think it's quite weird that the existence of such an important move relies only on Cersei's words. Could we really be so sure that Euron is actually going to Essos to hire the Golden Company?

Can you guys guess the titles of next seasons episodes? And if you want to go further, also post an outline prediction for each episode.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8cfkzg/spoilers_found_something_like_this_on_rasoiaf_and/,bleu5,1523803797,"1)  The Drowned God: Aside from getting a glimpse into Cersei, Jaime heading North, and Jon and Danys arrival at Winterfell, I think this episode will primarily focus on Theon, Yara(who I believe has had her tongue cut off,) and especially Euron. I refuse to believe the show would do that much disservice to not only such a vital character in the long scheme, but also easily the most evil and twisted character in the main story. Unleashing a Kraken? That would definitely make up for the corny pirate character from last season

2) The Prince That Was Promised: I think Dany is TPTWP, but thats not why I think this will be the name of the episode. My guess is Jons true parentage is revealed in this episode and hes falsely labeled as the TPTWP. More on that later. Dany also finds out shes pregnant(I could also see this happening late in episode 1.) After the revelation of her pregnancy, Tyrion tells her theres a small issue. He promised that Cerseis baby would be Danys heir since she was believed to be barren. Shes not happy about that all. AT ALL. Thankfully, Jaime shows up at Winterfell around this time and informs them of Cerseis true plans. Now Dany is definitely pissed. Jon reminds her of the task at hand and is able to convince her to worry about the danger coming from North soon. And as it turns out, that danger is approaching rapidly.

3) The Long Night: I think this will be the WW attack/seige/destruction/or whatever at Winterfell. Sadly, I think many will die. Even a major character. After rereading the series and picking up on what I to believe important foreshadowing, I firmly believe Arya is going to have to mercy kill Sansa (same way Lady died: sacrificed by a family member.) How exactly? Good question. If the WWs are there maybe she gets bitten by a wight and Arya ends it before too late? Hope not, that would be heartbreaking. Well probably see some more of Theon and Euron too. I believe Theon kills Euron but Yara dies as well. Theon becomes lord of the Iron Islands. Orrrrr Euron tries to seduce Dany and she sees right through him and sets Drogons flames upon him(I think this is how hell die in the books)

4) Azor Ahai: this I believe to be Jon. While many signs may point to Dany, shes The Prince(ss) That Was Promised. In season 7, Melisandre told Dany that she and Jon had roles to play in the war to come. Danys role isnt AA. Thats Jon. Hes the one who has to make the sacrifice to end the Long Night. Speaking of Melisandre, our favorite red priestess makes a return with some important news. Idk how the show will decide to go with this but either: A) Varys is a secret Targ himself (I think its pretty much confirmed he is a bastard Targ) and secretly plotting on Dany to take the throne for himself or B) Melisandre informs Dany that it was him who caused the downfall of her family by driving her father to extreme paranoia. Either way they decide to go, Dany burns Varys.

5) A Song of Ice and Fire: Climax of the Great War. Jon sacrifices Dany() but not before she gives birth (dont know when this happens. Either this episode or one of the two before.) Jon then kills NK and wights all just drop. Now all left to deal with Cersei. Im almost certain Jaime completes the valonqar prophecy but not without losing his own life ass well. Kings Landing is definitely getting completely destroyed by a dragon. In the books I think itll be Dany the one to do it but since shell probably be dead by this point in the show, maybe Bran wargs into a dragon? I dont see why hed have those intentions but hey, you never know.


6) A Dream of Spring: Reconstruction after the Great War, Starts are striving (I think all survive besides Sansa,) and a Targaryen restoration who is also half Wolf (child of Dany and Jon.) Jon refuses the throne (just as his great great grandfather Aemon did as well.) No clue what he decides to do with his life though. Tyrion as regent until the latest baby Targ comes of age.

For me these are enough to say they have a god and a religion. I think

1. Their god is ""death/hate"". Interesting that Arya said ""death"" is her god. And Hound said ""hate"" is keeping him.

2. Their god ordered them to fight another god called the lord of light (LL) who offers ""life/love"". 

3. There is another god called ""many faced god"". Is he the same as NK's god? If yes, things could be interesting: NK moves to their temple in braavos and take all the faces collected and put them on faces of his soldiers? And crown a new NK?

Do you think, NK and his army have a god? Is the great war a religious war between LL and that god? Who is serving who? Were First men serving LL and Andals serving death/hate/many faced god?

In this theory: house stark is serving death/hate and hound too,. And Cersei is serving LL (her obsession with love and life is amazing)... I want Cersei to be NK's wife to reach a lasting peace between life and death.

Are the current population aware who tgey are serving (without knowing)?",14,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now before you exit off thinking I am crazy here me out, as I make my points for why I believe this.

Okay so you are the Seven, The Seven are the Father, The Mother, The Warrior, the Smith, the Maiden, The Crone, and the Stranger. they are worshipped by the Faith of the Seven. So which of the Seven do R'hollor, Many faced, Drowned, Storm, and Great Other represent:

- The Father=R'hollor (because R'hollor is worshipped as a leader and the Lord of Light, and the Seven apparently represents light)

- The Mother=???

- The Warrior=Drowned God (Ironborn are warriors so that's why I see the Drowned God being the warrior)

- The Maiden=???

- The Stranger=The Many Faced God (do I even need to say why)

- The Smith=The Storm God

- The Crone=The Great Other

Now the only ones I could not find a fit for was the Mother and The Maiden which is why I only had question marks where they are. Now I do believe this theory and I think it be cool if each of the Seven were these gods I paired them with, now idk if I am the first to come up with this theory so if I am not, let me know.",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

There has been plenty of conversation about Jon, Dany, and crew inadvertently enabling the NK's bid to cross the Wall en masse and to obtain a dragon. While there are still plenty of questions about how much of a role the Wall had in keeping the Others out, and if the NK expected or foresaw any of the events that transpired, it seems fairly clear that the Night King and his army are far more of a greater threat now. While we don't quite have enough information to say definitively yet, it may be possible that the Northern threat may have remained largely a distant menace stuck behind a magical Wall, until Jon and allies ventured North and summoned Dany and her dragons. I mean, they obviously didn't know, they are mostly in a state of ignorance about the NK and the wights. 

They could have tried to work together to shore up Dany's win of Westeros, combining her conquering instincts with Jon's natural charisma with the common folk. Of course, it is doubtful the vast majority of the North would have joined in on this excursion, but they could have remained behind to prepare for the long Winter, and training for some inevitable conflict with the Others. Struck before Cersei solidified her partnership with the Iron Bank and contacted the Golden Company, and left her with little resources at the beginning of Winter. 

They could have continued mining and crafting dragon glass, training every man, woman, and child to fight, and storing resources for Winter, but just let the Wall keep out the worst of the Others and get Westeros mostly sorted first. 

Of course, hindsight is 20/20, they lacked quite a bit of knowledge that we in the audience know, etc. etc., but I just wanted to take the opportunity to say...Sansa was right. ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When we read the books we can see Margaery as a potencial option. Shes beautiful and inteligent. And she was somehow responsible of Joffreys death, and the distance between Cersei from power and control, including her childreen, with the help of her family, the Tyrells.

However, theres a woman, thats called the most beautiful woman in the entire world of ASOIAF. Daenerys has a large army and three dragons by her side. She is absolutely a threat for Cersey, once she can stole her crown and power. Its the more logical option, no doubt.

Some people believe that Sansa could be the YMBQ. Her beauty is mencioned more than one time and, in TWOW, shes called as the most beautiful maid in the Seven Kingdoms. Shes too a part of the events that lead to the death of Joffrey. She also has a connection with Jaime, who said in AFFC that Sansa Stark is my last chance of honour, referring to his promisse made to Catelyn Stark, after denied the request for help sent by Cersei.

When the prophecy was made, Marry said that this woman would take from Cersei all that she holds dear. And what does it mean?

Was she talking about this just as a metaphor for the power and crown that she would lose? Or when she talks about it she literally said that she would lose what she holds dear because of this person? I mean, her family/childreen, Jaimes devotion and affection and also her power?

Thats my doubt. Cause, if this was about power, its quite possible that the YMBQ is Daenerys Targaryen. But if this is a literal message this would fit for other characters, once Dany has nothing personal with Cersei.

I dont think that this would be Margaery, cause shes dead in the series and I believe that this will happen in the books too.

The other option is Sansa, who is envolved indirectly in the death of Joffrey (the others two we dont know how will be desenvolved in the next books) and has some kind of connection with Jaime.

What do you think? Was it literal, or was it about the power itself? Who do you think is this woman?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It is my belief that George R.R. Martin was heavily inspired by Creon when writing Stannis and his arc. Originally I wasn't going to write a post about this as I'm not the first person to notice these parallels, but the only other post about this I could find was written four years ago before the death of Stannis, and since that post was written several more details have appeared in the series that make the parallels between the two men even stronger.

Credit goes to u/BenMargarine for being the first to notice these parallels, even before they were as obvious as they are now:
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ma95k/show_spoilers_had_anybody_else_drawn_parallels/

Instead of repeating what u/BenMargarine has already said, I will instead discuss the parallels that can be drawn from Stannis's actions in Season 5, namely the ones that lead up to his death. u/BenMargarine kindly provided a synopsis of *Antigone* in his post, but I will try to explain the story of Creon as well as I can in my points of comparison.

- **Creon has his niece sentenced to death, so does Stannis to his daughter.** The central conflict of *Antigone* entails Creon's act of sentencing his niece Antigone to die for burying her brother despite it being forbidden by law. A debate that takes place over the course of the novel is if Creon did the right thing in sentencing Antigone, and a similar conflict can be seen in Stannis and the characters around him when he sentences his daughter Shireen to be burnt at the stake. Both men have to face the decision to execute their family members in order to uphold another value, and both men decide to do so.

- **Sentencing their family member results in the suicide of others close to them.** By sentencing Antigone to die, Creon causes his son Haemon, who loved Antigone, to kill himself. This crushes Creon. Additionally, and more importantly, Creon's wife Eurydice then kills herself after hearing of the loss of her son, cursing Creon as she does so. After Shireen has been killed, Stannis's wife Selyse also kills herself the very next day, distraught by the loss of her daughter.

- **Both men sacrifice their family members in order to uphold values they believe to be true.** Creon sentences Antigone to die because he believes, as the new king of Thebes, he must uphold the law of man no matter who may be guilty. Stannis sentences Shireen to die because he believes that doing so will result in him successfully gaining the Iron Throne, and to do so must uphold the wishes of the gods. Interestingly, Creon and Stannis's values appear to be the opposite: Creon strongly believes that the laws of man means more than the laws of the gods, while Stannis does terrible things in order to honour the supposed wishes of the gods, rather than sticking to his own beliefs that human sacrifice is wrong.

- **Both eventually turn out to be wrong, and realise too late.** Creon eventually realises his mistake and sets out to bury Antigone's brother Polynices himself and then prevent Antigone from dying, but does so too late. By the time he arrives to save Antigone, she has already hung herself instead of starving to death, which subsequently causes his son and wife to kill themselves as well. Stannis realises he is wrong the morning following the death of Shireen, and again realises after the act has already been completed. Stannis realises he is wrong when, despite Melisandre's promises, half his men desert his army and his wife kills herself, but by that point it is already too late to undo his own actions.

- **They both ignore those who argued against them.** Creon ignores every person who tries to convince him to change his mind, from his son Haemon to the prophet Tiresias, even if he once trusted them. Stannis does the same, almost killing Davos Seaworth whom he once named his Hand and sending him away when it came time to kill his daughter.

Personally, I love the two characters and their tragic outcomes. Stannis Baratheon is my favourite character in the series. There are interesting differences between the two men, such as Stannis being murdered while Creon is left alive, but I am very sure that George R.R. Martin took heavily from the arc of Creon in order to write the downfall of Stannis. What do you guys think?",3,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

A Song of Ice and Fire is fundamentally a story about the cycle of life and death. There are many theories that touch on this or go into detail extreme detail about it. Basically, it is pretty clear that life and death are the two opposing mythical forces that underpin the central underlying conflict of the story. The various religions and mythologies of the story represent different interpretations of either a 'god' of life, a 'god' of death, or both.

The Many Faced God is the god of death, representing sacrifice, tribute, payment, and loss. Other interpretations of this include the main religion in Westeros, the faith of the Seven, and the religion of the Iron Islands, the worship of the Drowned God. The Ironborn even say they 'do not sow', indicating they do not spread life. The White Walkers are agents of the god of death.

The Red God is a god of life. The red god represents warmth, resurrection, rebirth. I believe that the religion of the North, the 'Old Gods', is actually also an interpretation of the Red God, rather than an interpretation of the god of death. The Old Gods are associated with wierwood trees and the children of the forrest. Trees and plantlife almost always represent life in mythology. The Old Gods manifest in ways that seem to act in opposition to the White Walkers. Also, both the Old Gods and the Red God facilitate visions, the old gods through Greensight, and the Red God through fire magic. It is possible that the 'fire magic' is a meaningless ritual that followers of the Red God have come to associate with Greensight.

A snag in this theory is the fact that the children of the forrest created the White Walkers. Surely, the white walkers and the children are from the same magical family, then right? I believe that there are three possible explanations for this:

1. The White Walkers were corrupted by death. In this explanation, the children created the White Walkers as agents of life (to defend Westeros from the death and destruction of Men), only to have that plan backfire and for the white walkers to become corrupted by the god of death to become his agents. This is the most obvious, but least compelling of the three explanations IMO.

2. The God of Life asked the God of Death to destroy men. The children of the forrest (as agents of Life) created the Walkers through a pact with the God of Death. Life created Death to destroy Men. In this scenario, Men represent Life that brings death. Men are the ultimate corruption of the magic of the god of life.

3. Death didn't exist at all until the God of life needed it. The god of life didnt make a pact with death, the God of life CREATED death to destroy the First Men. Before Men, the children of the forrest lived in a sort of undying 'garden of eden'. Life created death to remove the corruption of Men from this perfect world. Death, of course, could not be controlled. Men are the balance between life and death, and the Children of the Forrest turned to Men to undo their mistake in creating life. The end result was that Men found balance between Life and Death.

I believe the third theory is the most compelling. It paints a picture of a world corrupted, but in balance. It reveals an ending that is not perfect. We all but know that this story will end in balance. But if balance is the natural way of things, then the restoration of balance almost seems too perfect an ending for GRRM. Instead, we are presented with a sort of 'paradise lost' scenario. The world was perfect before life created death, but is has been corrupted and can never go back. Instead, we find bittersweet balance.",10,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Does anyone think GRRM is waiting for the tv series to end before releasing anymore books? There could be a few reasons this is the case

1. He wants the book series and tv series to end in the same way for consistency. Of course he knows the ending as I'm sure he is a large part of the planning of the TV series, but maybe he wants to see how the end plays out or something like that

2. He may not want to spoil anything for anybody, including show watchers and book readers. Releasing the books early before the show ends would spoil it for many people watching the show 

3. HBO may have something in his contract preventing him from releasing any spoilers about the show. Releasing the books before the end of the show may violate this somehow, even though everything is his creation.

There are some surprising ones, but *a good portion of these* I have good reasons to suspect they are true.  Now, two of these are actual leaks but I won't say which ones they are. Note: some of these aren't expected to be in the order presented.

 - NK sacks Winterfell.

 - Melisandre uses magic to fight back the NK for the time being.

 - Jaime dies, after fighting, in the arms of Brienne.

 - Cersei miscarries.

 - Sam discovers the secret to Valyrian Steel.

 - Either something happens to Longclaw or Jon gives J-Bear longclaw because he needs his Valyrian Steel sword (signifying forgiveness on what J-Bear has done, much like what Jon did to theon).

 - Sansa is kidnapped by Cersei during some conflict between the two sides so Cersei has leverage on Jon.

 - Tyrion plans Cersei's assassination with Arya using Jaime's face.

 - Arya takes out Cersei.

 - The Hound crosses paths with Gregor. Cleganebowl happens. The Hound obviously wins.

 - Boatsexbaby (?)

 - Daenerys dies fighting the Others and becomes a Wight/Other. Very possibly another dragon gets taken down and becomes turned as well. (Cersei's conversation with Jaime before he left seems to suggests the latter part is true).

 - With the abundance of Valyrian Steel, and Jon without a weapon, Gendry reforges Ice from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail to remake the Stark ancestral sword. Jon will use this to fight the Others.

 - Jon kills Wight/Other Daenerys in some battle.

 - The AOTD will be lured into King's Landing.

 - Someone blows a horn to signal to light the fuse.

 - The Hound will light the wildfire cache under King's Landing, blowing up a significant amount of the AotD.

 - Battle for the Dawn between what's left of the AotD and the living.

 - Jon slays NK.

 - Jon, who has been given his spots as LC of NW and KotN through the means of the choice of the people and has inherited the throne through birthright and not by the people's choice, and Tyrion, who holds onto Daenerys' vision of breaking the wheel that crushes the people below them, will put into place a crowned republic/elected crown with checks and balances and several other important changes to end the Game of Thrones.

 - Tyrion will be elected as King and Sansa will sit by his side as Queen to rebuild Westeros after the Long Night. Whether or not they have a strictly political marriage or if they actually do have a consummated marriage in the end is beyond me.

 - Jon will return to the North with boatsexbaby to raise him/her as Ned raised him.

A Song of Ice and Fire  Series One: A Game of Thrones  
===================================

Prologue  
---------

*...and fifteen peaceful years have passed*  
*since rebels' war was won,*  
*since death of mad Targaryen king,*  
*since King Baratheon.*  

Meanwhile, in the Seven Kingdoms...  
-----------------------------------------

In Westeros he ruled (he thought),  
King Robert did, well fed.  
But uncocksure, he sought the help  
of Eddard Stark; called Ned.  

King Robert's Hand had died of late.   
Lord Jon Arryn in pain  
passed on. By whom we cannot say  
he was so cruelly slain.  

A man named Will, deserted from  
the Rangers, said he'd seen  
the walking dead beyond the Wall,  
but who knew where he'd been.  

Lord Eddard Stark considered that  
and said, It's just a myth.  
The Walkers went extinct long since,  
and lopped Will's head forthwith.  

The Stark kids found a Direwolf bitch  
dead cold beneath a log.  
They took its pups, adopted them,  
as Ned said, Be more dog.  

Then Rob the King rode far oop north.  
With Winterfell in sight,  
he paused with punctuating fart  
and said, Let's all get tight.  

Rob's erstwhile comrade Ned gave in  
when Rob said, Be my Hand.  
The King rejoiced to think that with  
Ned's help he'd tame the land.  

All unbeknownst to none but knew,  
the twins up in the tower,  
were bonking in the way of dogs,  
and at it for an hour.  

We'd call it incest, what they'd done,  
but they pled sibling love,  
and caught by Bran in flagrante,  
dispatched him with a shove.  

Poor Bran was broke and comatose.  
The Starks were all distressed.  
Yet Ned and girls still rode off south,  
with Bran prescribed bed-rest.  

Prince Joffrey was a teenage brat  
betrothed to Sansa Stark,  
whose sister caused a wee affray  
that ended Direwolf's bark.  

When Arya sparred with butcher's boy,  
the bully drew his sword.  
Her Direwolf bared its teeth on wrist  
and bit the little coward.  

That Cersei's wrath was seen to show,  
was telling, while the son,  
although the firstborn bound to rule,  
was cruel; ask anyone.  

Nymeria fled the scene, which meant  
that Lady faced instead  
a proxy death; a sacrifice,  
administered by Ned.  

Bran hadn't fallen to his death,  
but for his Direwolf's teeth,  
he would've been disposed of by  
a dagger's lifeblood thief.  

Assassin lost his throat to wolf  
as Catelyn faced him game.  
A long, blonde hair from in the tower  
suggested who to blame.  

Awake, but with no memory,  
Bran, left to lie in bed,  
saw Catelyn (Mum) rush off darn sarf  
to tell the tale to Ned.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but that seems to be the general consensus of what her character is going to do, however George likes to set things up as an obvious storyline and then surprise readers in various ways and that's what I want to discuss, how might George surprise us with this character?

Stoneheart seems to be sort of an exception to the rule that all characters are morally gray, has she purposely been set up as a character that is black and white, motivated only by revenge and malice so that it can be revealed that there is far more to her than that? Or has she been set up as Cat, character motivated by all the normal things, love, ambition, hate, etc so that we can see her become a monster later? Maybe this change is so we can see a similar redemption arc to that of Jaime and Theon. After all, the audience is meant to be conflicted about a character who is killing characters that are largely uninvolved with Rob and Cat's death and horrified by her when she attempts to kill Brienne and Podrick. It's difficult to say whether Stoneheart even fully knows what she's doing given her rather zombified like state, will she get any chapters as Stoneheart? Perhaps she will regain some consciousness and memories enough to warrant chapters and change the direction of this character?

Especially since we are on the verge of so many of them in Winterfell and eventually King's Landing.

Which ones do you believe the writers will want to show and/or feel obligated to present to the audience?

Will show:
Arya and Jon, I just can't imagine that being skipped.

Bran and Jon, for the same reasons as above, with the addition of Bran needing to pass along some critical information.

Sam and Jon, and I think this will happen at the same time as his reunion with Bran.

Sansa and Jon. She will be there with the other Starks for one big Stark reunion. The writers will likely start the Sansa and Dany fighting for Jon's personal identity struggles very early on.

Hound and Sansa. I think Brienne not even mentioning Sansa to the Hound in S7 (at least onscreen) was to set up for an awkward yet poignant reunion situation in the show.

Jaime and Tyrion. Sure they reunited recently, but this will be a coming together reunion...assuming Jaime survives the initial encounter with all people in the North. He likely will.

Offscreen:
Sansa and Tyrion. Unfortunately,  I don't think we will see much of this reunion interaction.

The Hound and Arya. We will see them interact for sure, but that initial reunion will be skipped. I think the Hound and Brienne talk about Arya in S7 was it.

Theon and most everyone, with the possible exception of Sansa or Jon. His potential return to Winterfell (if he does, that is) will focus on confronting his demons and his inner Reek.

Jorah and House Mormont. I think it possible Jorah dies early on to protect Dany or Jon for Dany, and I don't know if the writers will have time to do that reunion first. 

Plenty more I am not thinking about right now, but will add to comments as more come to mind.

I have no foreknowledge of the season, but am basing these predictions on what I would do if I were in the writer's room for season 8, trying to create the most satisfying endgame possible for every major character that still feels fully on-brand for what people have come to expect from Game of Thrones. This means that there have to be some shocking deaths and an ending that is probably less bleak than GRRM intended.
  
Predictions (in roughly chronological order):  
- Cersei's threat is seemingly neutralized early in the season due to our heroes finding out about her plan and the threat of the white walkers increasing significantly.  
- Euron kills Yara, Theon kills Euron, and then Theon hopefully dies because come on put him out of his misery already.  
- Jon dies killing the Night King, and does so with at least a couple episodes remaining in the season.  
- After Jon dies, Daenerys dies shockingly in a scene where her death is not at all expected (with at least a couple episodes also remaining).  
- With the threat of the white walkers neutralized and Jon and Daenarys dead, it seems that the darkest possible timeline has won, with Cersei re-emerging to tighten her grip on the kingdom and killing several major-ish characters over a couple episodes (Gendry comes to mind).  
- Melisandre and Varys die during a failed scheme to undermine Cersei.  
- The Mountain kills the Hound in Cleganebowl, and Arya avenges him by killing the Mountain.  
- Jamie kills Cersei and is forgiven by Bran, almost completely redeeming his character (and maybe ending up with Briene, or more likely dying beside Cersei in a kind of Romeo and Juliet situation).  
- Sansa becomes Queen (or some more democratic version of that) of the seven kingdoms with Arya and Sam Tarly by her side.  
- Tyrion is either killed by Cersei or lives to be an advisor to Sansa.

1. Does this mean that Jon is technically the heir, or is Daenerys since she's older?

2. Doesn't this make him Daenerys' nephew? I mean I know incest is a running theme in the show but I'm just trying to get the lineage straight.

It's devolved into a traditional fantasy**  What made GoT so great from seasons 1-4 was how it was so grounded in reality. You won the game of thrones through deception, cunning, and political maneuvering. Baelish, Tywin, Olenna etc. were all experts at playing the game. Now you win the game win the game with dragons (Daenerys and the Night King) and have to fight ice zombies. So run of the mill.  **2.) Actions Don't Have Consequences Anymore**  In early seasons, every miscalculation had consequences. Eddard showing his hand to Cersei in season 1 got him killed. Robb refusing to marry a Frey got his wife, his direwolf, his mother, and himself killed. Now, Jon can fall into a frozen lake surrounded by the army of the dead and survive. Jaime can charge straight at a fully-grown dragon and survive. Jon can be about to lose the Battle of the Bastards and have Nights of the Vale show up right on time. Again, it's become a traditional fantasy in that the main heroes escape death far too often.  **3.) There are no more grey characters**  With the exception of Eddard and Joffrey, no character in the early seasons was wholly good or wholly evil. Baelish, Varys, Jaime, Stannis, the Hound etc. Now the characters are black and white. The good Targaryens, good Lannisters, and good Starks fighting the evil ice zombies, with the evil Lannisters plotting against them.  Just my thoughts, let me know what you think

It would be epic if Cersie tried to make her write a note to the North just like in Season 1 and Sansa refused to cooperate this time to really bring her character arc full circle. Cersie desides to put her to death just like ned only this time right before she is beheaded Arya takes off her face of the executioner, and Danny shows up with her Dragons and most of the north is there to take kings landing. Arya can then behead Cersie just like her father was. (Arya to Sansa in S7: You passed the sentence, I was just the executioner.) Turns out it was all a set up by Sansa in the first place. It's a nice redemption for Ned's execution and a perfect was to introduce a surprise attack for us as an audience. I know it probably wont happen but it would be an epic thing to watch.

Longclaw: Jon Snow's Mormont family blade, which gen has killed several White Walkers with.
Petyr Baelish's dagger: held by Arya Stark. I would be surprised if she directly fights a Walker though.
Widow's Wail: Joffrey's sword, held by Jaime lannister. Since they went out of their way to remind viewers Jaime now has this blade, I suspect that is a Chekhov's Sword and he will be using it soon.
Oathkeeper: Widow's Wail's sister sword, held by Brienne of Tarth. 
Heartsbane: the Tarly family sword, stolen by Sam Tarly. Again, like Jaime's sword, I can't imagine they would have included that whole plot line in season six if there was no intent for Sam to ever use the sword.

There is something interesting I only recently made a connection to.

In this first clip Cersei tells Margaery about the history of House Reyne and ""The Rains of Castamere"":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDl-H8wNJ18. 

Cersei says ""And now the rains weep o'er his halls, and not a soul to hear"" is a reference to the Reynes bodies being hung high at Casterly Rock (""now the Reynes weep o'er his halls"").

The Second clip Bronn sings the Rains of Castamere with the Lannister men:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDl-H8wNJ18

GRRM directed this episode so foreshadowing is to be expected.

Bronn's singing starts at the end of Cersei's scene where Cersei is the focus of the shot.  The scene cuts to a hallway as the men continue singing, and as soon as they get to ""but now the rains weep o'er his halls"" it focuses in on a hanged man.

So the valonqar's hands choking the life from her might be a noose.",11,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

If the travel time is slow there could be some great options.

1. The Gold.  Yes, the gold from high garden was given to the Iron Bank but most banks like to get gold in their vaults before making a new loan.  A small number of ships sailing the gold to the IB could be intercepted by Theon or taken by Salladhor Saan.  I can't imagine that a pirate wouldn't be interested in getting that gold.  If the gold doesn't make it to the IB, they could cancel the loan to hirer the Golden Company.

2. Sea Battle.  Davos gets Salladhor Saan to fight against the Iron fleet backed by dragons.  The battle could happen before or after the GC is picked up.  If the GC is on the ships they could turn against the Iron Born once they see the dragons and give the Iron Fleet to Danny.

If time is running quickly I think there are two interesting options.

3. Danny visits IB.  The IB doesn't want to back a looser, so if Danny rides a dragon to the IB it would be a very impressive way to start a discussion that would end the IB support of Cersei.  Also, the history of Bravos should make it easier for them to support ""The Breaker of Chains.""

4. Jorah to the rescue.  Jorah sails or flies to meet with the GC to convince them to support Danny because she is going to win and she is a Targ.  The S7 Histories and Lore confirmed that Jorah fought for the GC and it's Targ founding so it should be hard for the GC to fight against Danny.

These ideas depend on either the GC either not having officially signed on to fight for Cersei, or the GC is fighting for who pays them i.e. the IB.

Apart from the jousting contest or melee in the first series, there hasn't been any sporting event portrayed. It's as if in the medieval-like period of Martin's history, people don't play sports. That's unlikely to have been the case in 'reality' and the omission is surely just because there's no plot line to support a sport being played.

However, if there was a medieval version of something like American Football (maybe the Hawick Ba' Game on a grand scale, played with the severed heads of slain enemies instead of a leather ball), can you imagine Beyonce singing The Rains of Castamere in the interval?

1219,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-4-20,2018,4,20,7,8ding0,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] How an Icelandic Saga might predict Game of Thrones,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ding0/spoilers_how_an_icelandic_saga_might_predict_game/,FiveMinFreedom,1524176056,"First up, [here's](http://sagadb.org/hrafnkels_saga_freysgoda.en) the Saga. It's an interesting read, though difficult to get into if you're unfamiliar with sagas. Nevertheless, I recommend giving it a read.    

So here's a quick, quick summary of the story (apologies if some names are different; I read it in another language):   
&gt; A man named Hallfrer (who traveled to the foreign country, Iceland) has a dream which causes him to relocate his family - his wife and son named Hrafnkell. Following the death of his father, Hrafnkell establishes rule over the region. Hrafnkell's family is very religious and a symbol of their religion is the horse Freymane. When a shepherd disobeys Hrafnkell and rides Freymane, Hrafnkell kills him. This causes the man's family, especially a man named Saam, to revenge his death and drives Hrafnkell off the land, Saam then rules the region. For many years Saam rules until suddenly Hrafnkell murders his uncle and wins back the ""throne"".

I'm sure a lot of you have already picked up on some similarities, but I'm going to give a rundown of my personal findings.  

* *The family of Hrafnkell moved due to a prophetic dream, which resulted in the family prospering.*   
This mirrors the story of House Targaryen, whose ancestor moved to Dragonstone following the dream of a daughter, saving them from the Doom of Valyria   
* *The family is very religious, reflected in the horse.*    
This is also similar to House Targaryen which has a history of obsession with prophecy relating to fire. A reflection of their religion is their dragons, much like the horse, Freymane, is a reflection of Hrafnkell's. (Freymane literally means Freya, a Nordic goddess, horse)    
*  *Hrafnkell kills a shepherd which leads to the shepherd's family to take up revenge.*    
This is similar to the Mad King killing Brandon Stark, which basically results in House Stark starting the rebellion. (To be real with you, I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate to say, but it's definitely an important moment which leads to the same thing in both stories)   
* *The shepherd's family goes around pleading their case to other families in hopes of them joining them. He enlists the help of a friend or family member (honestly, I got lost there. Sagas have complicated character backgrounds, but it doesn't really matter), Saam, who ends up leading the ""fight"" and takes the ""throne""*   
This is like the Stark family rallying the houses of Westeros alongside house Baratheon, with Robert Baratheon taking the Iron Throne at the end of it all.   
* *Saam lets Hrafnkell live and allows him to live in exile, this leads to Hrafnkell eventually overthrowing Saam.*   
While Robert Baratheon definitely doesn't let the Mad King or Prince Rhaegar live, he does eventually (on his deathbed) allow Daenerys to live. This is where we get into predictions based on the story. According to this parallel, Daenerys (or House Targaryen, maybe Young Griff) will win back the Iron Throne.    
I would also like to add the fact that Saam systematically burned down Hrafnkell's churches, which is very similar to what the First Men did to the Weirwood trees of the Children of the Forrest - though this doesn't tie into the rest of the theory, it could have served as one source of inspiration for George R. R. Martin, if he read this saga.   

This leads me to my final point which is that George R. R. Martin is a history nerd, capital N. It is well known that a lot of elements from Game of Thrones were inspired by historical events. It's not far-fetched to assume that he knows about Icelandic sagas and might have read this one.   
I don't believe everything from this story is going to be mirrored in Game of Thrones, but I couldn't help but notice the similarities. Personally, I think George might have been inspired by this riches to rags to riches story as well as the religious imagery, although that is more a historical fact than it is specific to this story.   
I can't wait to hear someone call me an idiot because everyone knows George based House Targaryen on Hrafnkell's family, and to be fair, I didn't google this before writing this, so I might just have wasted a lot of time with this, but I just found it very interesting.   

I would love to hear if anyone else finds any similarities between the stories.",4,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

There's also the alternative theory that Bran is the Lord of Light, which I'll link [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4itr7s/everything_bran_is_the_lord_of_light/)

As you can see there is definitely some overlap in both theories, suggesting that Bran is influencing past events that are highly relevant to the plot, etc. Is is possible that both are true? Could Bran be both the Night King and the Lord of Light, battling himself for thousands of years in some weird, complicated time-traveling plot? Is Bran the song of ice and fire?

""I've always agreed with William Faulknerhe said that the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about. I've always taken that as my guiding principle, and the rest is just set dressing."" - George RR Martin.

If Bran was both the Night King and the Lord of Light, it would certainly embody the concept of the human heart in *literal* conflict with itself.

Jojen said that Bran was the only thing that mattered. And the rest... is just set dressing.

1. One NK's man was taken by humans to the south of wall.
2. In return NK wants one human (alive to turn) to be taken from westeros to the north.

It is a fair exchange and Bran and NK staged everything. At one moment Bran had a vision and went from winterfell to NK camp. He used ravens for that.

If you remember, NK camp was exactly where later Jon and friends go and get rescued by Danny.

What if: the idea to go there was bran idea to help NK to get south of wall and make the final exchange possible?

The final exchange is the princess: NK wants a princess who was promised to him by LL long time ago. Who better than Melisandre? Or Arya Stark? So the prince/princess that was promised was about an item of peace treaty between LL and god of NK: when the time comes and NK needs a replacement, LL gives him a princess to turn and she will bear NK a son.

If Arya is the princess, Starks will always rule the north (the real north). Targaryans will rule the south. As we know the two houses had that agreement for a long time. Danny has read about that and she got her facts right.

**The Third Twist**
-

Trough part 1 to 3 of this series outlining the final season of Game of Thrones, we've covered as many theories and as many twists as one would care to count.
___
And at the end of it all, we've been left with the wildly unpopular Littlefinger ruling from the Iron Throne. 
___
But why would that be? Is it because the writer of this article is a huge Baelish fan, and for some reason, secretly roots for the little evil to win it all? Or is there something more to it?
___
___
At its core, Game of Thrones is about *""the human heart in conflict with itself""*. There are dragons, magic, zombies, and whatnot in this story. But these are just surroundings. The main questions and doubts the characters experience remain similar to ours, not matter the world or the timeline they've been put into. What really matters is why they do what they do. What is it in their head that makes them think this is what they should do?
___
In these final chapters, we'll reflect on this very thing: *""the human heart in conflict with itself""*. But instead of the heart of the characters, we'll focus on our hearts. What is it that makes us hate Littlefinger? And how did he get to the top?
___
___
Through season 1 to 3, D&amp;D have turned most people from Jaime haters, wanting to shut their TV whenever they see him on screen; to Jaime supporters, openly rooting for the Lannister by the end of season 3. But up until the end of season 7, Jaime is still the same incestuous/cousin murderer we've been introduced to. Struggling with the conflicting vows he has sworn to uphold, trying to preserve what is left of his honor. The character himself has not changed that much. But our perception of him and our understanding of his actions have. On the other hand, by the end of season 7, Dan &amp; David have managed to create an oddity: having people think an incestuous relationship between Jon &amp; Daenerys is OK.
___
So our thoughts and beliefs can be wrong more often than we'd like to admit. And it's mostly because of these two things: forming an opinion without enough knowledge; and allowing strong feelings to blur our judgement.
___
___
If this show was about sitting Dany, Jon, Tyrion or any other fan favorite on the Iron Throne, we would enjoy the ride and we would be pleased with the fantastic battle scenes and CGI. Things would have gone the way we'd expect. And at the end of the day, there wouldn't be much to learn from this outcome. With time, we'd forget about it all.
___
But this is not another regular show. The ending Martin and D&amp;D have worked towards, for the better part of their lives, is revolting, thought-provoking, and above all, the outcome we needed to help us grow:
___

- *""It won't go the way some people want,""* Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran) hinted, http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/game-of-thrones/feature/a854007/game-of-thrones-season-8-spoilers-episode-6/;

- *""[...] You know with something this big like Game of Thrones, you cannot please everyone.""* - Iain Glen (Ser Jorah Mormont);

- When asked about the ending back in 2011's comic con, George said: *""I hope some people like it.""* 

___
___
In this final series of thoughts, we'll explore: the third and biggest twist of the entire *A Song of Ice And Fire* series; exactly how wrong we might have been in judging D&amp;D's work; and why ***It would be a Sin to Kill a Mockingbird*** *.*

___
**The Lion Cub's Golden Chain**
-

At the start of Game of Thrones, in his quest for Chaos, Baelish needed to create friction and ignite suspicion between two of the strongest houses of the 7 Kingdoms: Starks &amp; Lannisters.
___
And in s07e07, Bran tells us that Littlefinger had indeed sent the Catspaw assassin to Winterfell to take the young Lord's life.
___
Had it not been for this attempted murder and Littlefinger's lie about the identity of the owner of the Valyrian Dagger (which Baelish had really lost to Robert and not Tyrion), the conflict between Starks &amp; Lannisters might have been harder to spark.
___
In the books, Jaime says it was Joffrey that gave the order, ""to impress Robert"". And GRRM confirmed that Joffrey had hired the assassin to kill Bran: *""After overhearing Robert's claim that men could end the suffering of a horse with a broken leg or a dog that [had] gone blind, but that they [were] too weak to end the suffering of a crippled child, Joffrey [stole] a Valyrian dagger from his father and [hired] a servant to kill Bran.""*
___
So on one hand, we have D&amp;D telling us it was Littlefinger that sent the Catspaw. On the other hand, George claiming it was Joffrey that had hired the servant *(i.e. the assassin)* and stolen Littlefinger's dagger from Robert. Which one is lying?
___
The answer is: nobody. Both statements are true.

___
Joffrey did do these things, but he could not have accomplished this on his own. Simply because he had left Winterfell two weeks prior to the attempt. And you cannot trust a servant you have randomly hired to stay behind and manage to assassinate one of the most powerful young Lords in the North.
___
Plus, how exactly had Joffrey found a servant that had agreed to murder his own lord in exchange for gold? Did he or his men (e.g. The Hound, The Mountain) wonder around Winterfell, asking servants, who would be willing to kill Bran for them? 

___
No. There must have been someone else helping him. Someone that was still in Winterfell when the event took place. 

___
___
On the other hand, if the real intention was to get rid of Bran, why hire a middle-aged servant that even struggled against an unarmed Catelyn? A man that looked more like a random farmer wanting to make an extra buck than anything resembling a skilled assassin, fit to kill a Lord.
___
In addition, when the Catspaw entered Bran's chambers and ran into Catelyn, he said: *""You weren't supposed to be here. No one was supposed to be here""*. 

But everybody in Winterfell knew Catelyn had not left Bran's side in weeks. Even the assassin had to have known that. Especially since he was supposed to have been a servant. So this means he had been fed some fresh information by an insider. An insider that had ensured him he would not find anybody by Bran's side. A source reliable enough for the Catspaw to have been surprised when the intelligence proved wrong and he actually saw Catelyn in that room.
___
The assassin had been deceived. And it looks like the person Joffrey had trusted with overseeing the operation never intended on killing Bran, but had planned on framing the Lannisters for attempted murder instead.
___
___
Which raises the following questions: Who is this other person that wanted to turn the Wolves vs the Lions? And who would a middle-aged assassin/servant trust to know when Bran would be alone and vulnerable? Who could have discretely started a fire in Winterfell, while assuring the Catspaw he wouldn't meet anyone by Bran's side?
___
Once you take away the Starks from that scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFLo7gef6Gs, there is only one candidate left, *Maester Luwin*. 
___
He was one of the few persons an outsider would believe to hold accurate information regarding Bran's status. He was the man that ensured Joffrey killing Bran was an act of mercy. And he would have known exactly which ""servant"" to suggest for the job. 
___
Maester Luwin was the only person in Winterfell that would have been able to send information to King's Landing and one of the few men smart enough to help Littlefinger frame the Lannisters (Master of Ravens is a key position for a traitorous spy). 
___
And if you pay close attention to this series of events: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFLo7gef6Gs&amp;t=65s (1:05 - 1:50), you'll understand exactly what happened:

- Luwin went into Bran's chambers to talk to Catelyn;
- Right after he left, he told the Cat's paw: *""The way is clear. No one is by Bran's side""*;
- Shortly after leaving Robb and Cat, he started a fire; 
- At which point Robb ran out of the room and the assassin went in, as he had been advised;
- But to make sure the man would not kill Bran, Luwin immediately sent Summer after him.  

___
Maester Luwin could not afford to sacrifice the young lord for this scheme. With this failed attempt, the deed had been done: Starks would never again trust Lannisters.
___
___
On the other hand, just like D&amp;D stated in season 7, Littlefinger did send the Catspaw to Winterfell. But not to try to kill Bran. Baelish was no fool, he would never have trusted some random sell sword to plot the execution of Ned's son, let alone to do it in the middle of Winterfell. This ""assassin"" he had sent was simply a servant working for Lysa Arryn, charged only with delivering a beautifully crafted carved wooden box to Maester Luwin. 
___
The box contained an encrypted letter designed to be read by Catelyn Tully: ""Lysa wrote Jon Arryn has been murdered by the Lannisters"", did she tell Ned. Thus, planting the seed of doubt into his head.
___
But in that box was another item: a fine lens from Myr, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgaNXPOD9wY&amp;t=600s (10:00). Littlefinger had attached the lens so Luwin could decipher another message far more important: *""The Lannisters are coming to Winterfell. Find a way to turn the Wolves against the Lions.""*.

___
And so Maester Luwin set himself into motion. When Jaime pushed Bran out of the window and Robert boasted drunk about how killing a cripple was mercy, Luwin saw the opportunity. He reached out to the naive Prince and started lecturing Joffrey on how sad and miserable the life of his beloved little lord, Bran Stark, was doomed to be. A life of crawling, one where he would never be able to ride or lead an army to battle. This was no fate for a Lord of Winterfell.
___
Recalling Robert words, Joffrey asked: *""What if someone was brave enough to end his suffering?""*. To which Luwin replied: *""It would take a very noble and courageous man to save our little Lord from his destiny of misery""*. Joffrey took the bait in full and boasted: *""I will do it.""* 
___
Luwin had won. From this point on, he advised Joffrey into stealing Littlefinger's Valrian steel dagger from Robert, so it would serve as weapon and as payment. Then, Luwin knew just the right servant to suggest for the job: the Catspaw sent to Winterfell by Littlefinger. An expendable man that no one would recognize in the castle. After Joffrey left the North, the young cub knew he could count on Maester Luwin to see the operation through.
___
On his end, Joffrey was hoping that once Robert had learned about Bran's death, he would rejoice:*""Whoever did this is a hero! A man far braver and more merciful than the lot of you cowards.""*. To which Joffrey would have replied:*""I did it Father. It was me!""* 

Keep in mind poor Joffrey was mentally disabled. One cannot expect the brain of a child born of incest to be complete. And if this wasn't enough, even his parents were the product of incest (Tywin had married his cousin Joanna)...
___
___
Like Martin had hinted when asked if Littlefinger had influenced Joffrey to try and kill Bran: *""Littlefinger did have a certain hidden influence over Joff...but he was not at Winterfell. And that needs to be remembered.""*  - GRRM

Maester Luwin was Littlefinger's ace at Winterfell, his secret influence over Joffrey and the Golden Chain that would lure the Lion into a pitfall.

___
___
___
**A Candle of Corruption**
-

Now why would Maester Luwin betray the Starks? He had been serving them for decades and they had always been good and just to him. Catelyn even trusted him with delivering all 5 of her children into the world.
___
The truth is Luwin's betrayal had nothing to do with the Starks, the Lannisters or the Tullys. His motives were not personal nor political, but deeply spiritual. Maester Luwin had been one of the corrupted Maesters from the beginning, working hand to hand with Littlefinger &amp; the Faceless Men to turn Starks vs. Lannisters and plunge the 7 Kingdoms into Chaos.
___
___
In part 3 of this series, chapters *Valar Morghulis* &amp; *Justice for the Children (https://redd.it/89pzdp),* we've presented how hard the Children have worked for the past 500 years, to create the best conditions for the return of the Night King. In doing so, the Children had two goals: 1) getting rid of the dragons &amp; 2) keeping the realms of men as divided and weak as possible.
___
To achieve this monumental task, the Children counted on one of their strongest weapons, the worshipers of the Many Faced God of Death: the Faceless Men. This league of skilled assassins had proven extremely effective, and beyond all, most faithful to their cause. 
___
After a direct call from the God of Death (which is really just a Children passing for the voice of the Many Faced God), the assassins were put into motion and sent to Westeros: *Valar Dohaeris. All Men Must Serve.*
___
Unfortunately, these men had no idea that the God they were serving was the Children of the Forest. All they could understand was that there was one true God in this world, the God of Death. And to reward them for their faith, he had made his will known to their ears. It was now up to the Faceless Men to be his vessel and execute the divine commands.
___
___
In their quest to turn Westeros upside down, the Faceless Man had come to realize the importance of Oldtown centuries ago, particularly the importance of its Order of Maesters, trained inside of the Citadel. 
___
Maesters serve many functions: lore-masters and advisers to noble families, responsible for promoting literature culture, and providers of writing services. Almost every castle and noble family, no matter how small, had a maester on hand to teach the lord's children, give him counsel, and attend to medical and educational needs. On top of this, the lords of the Seven Kingdoms were also reliant on Maester's ability to send long distance communiques using trained messenger ravens, which they were responsible for.
___
So Maesters are essentially the eyes, the ears, and the brains of the castle. Find a way to infiltrate the Citadel and corrupt the Order and you will have a firm grip on the fate of Westeros.
___

But the Maesters are not a religious order and are well-known for their disdaining belief in magic. Entirely separate from the religious clergy, Maesters are expected to eschew their familial background and political allegiances. They drop their family name when they join the order and are assigned to serve at castles and holdfasts throughout the Seven Kingdoms. While bound by their vows to serve whoever holds the castle in which they reside, regardless of changes in lordship.
___
On paper, corrupting this Order sounds nearly impossible.
___
In other words, nothing that would deter the Faceless Men. At its core, the Citadel is a gathering of erudite men, dedicating their lives to science. But nowadays, most of its adherents are poor peasants, bastards and other men whose families have disowned them. Mentally fragile folks and other people that have nowhere to go. 
___
The Citadel is similar to the House of Black &amp; White in that regard. Its first Faceless Men were originally broken slaves from Valyria that willingly turned themselves into servants in the hope of finding a higher purpose to their existence (i.e. serving the God of Death). And in Oldtown, there are many broken men/disciples looking to become Maesters. Surely, there would be a way for the assassins to convert some of these people to their cause. 
___
To this end, the Faceless Men carefully observed the Maesters. It turned out at the end of their training, each Maester had to go through a specific experience that would cement his belief in magic not being part of this World:
___
*The night before an acolyte attempting to join the Order of Maesters says his vows, he must spend an all-night vigil attempting to light a glass candle. Secretly, this is actually impossible, and the point of the exercise is to impress upon the new initiate that even with all of their knowledge, some things are impossible - and to stress that magic doesn't exist. Even acolytes who are not studying the ""higher mysteries"" - magic - must undergo this ritual. - http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Glass_candle*
___
So during this night, a Faceless Man would appear from the shadows and reveal to the young acolyte the magic of the Faces. After witnessing the irrefutable, the acolyte was in shock. All the knowledge he had acquired was not enough to rationally explain this series of events. Then, the Faceless Man would continue by explaining to the Maesters they had been right in being skeptical about religion. Because all the many faces and the different gods around the world were in fact one and only God, the God of Death. He was the one sharing his magic with them. He was the one whose voice could be heard. And he was the only one men must serve.
___
Not every Maester would be swayed. But by targeting the distressed (which is at least, 50% of the disciples), before long, the Faceless Men had acquired an army of very educated and influential allies spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms: the Knights of the Mind.  
___
___
___


**The Weirwood Tree**
-

50 years from our present, the Children of the Forests had released the Night King. He was now in need of time to grow an army and create enough White Walkers. Meanwhile, the Children couldn't allow the realms of men to prosper in peace, while the dead were not at full power. They yearned for war and chaos in the 7 Kingdoms, so: 

- Men would not pay attention to the White Walker threat growing in the North; 
- Men would keep on killing each other; negating any chance they might have had at defeating the White Walkers.

___
But it was out of question for the remaining Children to act in person. In their stead, they entrusted the perilous quest to the Faceless Men &amp; the corrupted Maesters. 

After decades of plotting, these faithful servants had heavily influenced the start of Robert's Rebellion, a war that would plunge the 7 Kingdoms into Chaos. 20 years later, the Faceless Men &amp; the Maesters were once again plotting another all out war, the War of the 5 Kings.
___
And in this venture, they had found a great deal of help from a cunning and most ambitious young Lord, Littlefinger. 

___
___
So in the end, Maester Luwin had successfully orchestrated the Catspaw operation to frame the Lannisters, and particularly Tyrion. Not for any personal or political reasons, but because of his unwavering faith in the God of Death. Serving his divine will and achieving his mission was the only thing that truly mattered for Luwin. 
___
However, sacrificing Bran for this plot was never in the cards. The Children needed Bran alive more than anything! Their whole plan relied on Bran completing his timeloop and becoming the unstoppable Night King. This is why Luwin made sure to send the frailest middle aged servant he could possibly find for the job. Luwin was certain this Catspaw would never manage to stab Bran. The assassin had been struggling against an unarmed Catelyn, let alone him having any chance at killing Summer, the direwolf. 

___
Finally, when Maester Luwin was fatally injured by Theon's men, at the court of Winterfell, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5eyJin4R18&amp;t=383s (6:23 - 6:30); 

The last thing he did was put his body near the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kF7MaPli8Y (1:23 - 2:05). 

So in his last moments, old Maester Luwin gathered all of his remaining strength to drag his dying body all the way from the court of Winterfell to the front of a Weirwood tree. Despite Maesters being an entirely separate Order from the religious clergy, the last thing Luwin did was related to religion. 
___
This action was clearly important to Luwin. The reason behind this behavior was to let the Many Faced God know one of his faithfuls had died (through the Weirwood Net). All so the God of Death could replace Luwin with another of his servants and preserve his firm grip on Winterfell. Just like he had once done with Maester Luwin, after his predecessor, Maester Walys, had left the North.
___
___
In this regard, Lady Dustin was one of the wisest people: *""If I were queen, the first thing I would do would be to kill all those grey rats. They scurry everywhere, living on the leavings of the lords, chittering to one another, whispering in the ears of their masters... Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And* ***before too long, the ruler has become the ruled***,*""* had she said.
___
Lady Dustin was right to resent Maester Walys, whom she claimed came to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard Starks ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey, and arrange the Tully marriage. 
___
And if Walys and Luwin were part of the corrupted Maesters, rest assured they were not the only Maesters involved in this grand conspiracy.
___

**The Shadow of the Mockingbird**
-

Back in King's Landing, Littlefinger would have benefited from chaos arising from a conflict between Starks &amp; Lannisters. And it's understandable that framing Tyrion was a good attempt at getting rid of his brains and annoying intellect.
___
But while Baelish would have welcomed war between the Five Kings, there is a pattern to his actions, *""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects"" - Petyr.*: 

- When he planned the assassination of Joffrey, it was at Lady Olenna's command &amp; following the will of the Martells;
- When he had Jon Arryn poisoned, it was at the request of Lysa Arryn (to prevent Jon from sending her son away). 

Petyr always makes sure to have someone greater than him backing him up and initiating the action. The bigger the scheme, the stronger and the more influential the ally.
___
But plotting a war between 5 out of the 7 Kingdoms is something else entirely. Which ally could Littlefinger possibly have found that would be powerful enough to want to put these pieces into motion?
___
The answer is: the Faceless Men. And by extension, the corrupted Maesters. All under the hidden influence of the Children of the Forest.
___
The league of assassins had been put into motion a long time ago. And slowly but surely, the Faceless Men had infiltrated King's Landing and started moving their pieces without being noticed. 
___
But despite all of their talents and their magic, there was one man that had taken notice of their presence. A cunning Westerosi that had been going out of his way to understand everything going on in King's Landing: the young Master of Coin. It did not take long for Littlefinger to notice the odd fish and introduce himself to these new players. 
___
Seeing how ambitious and avid for chaos Baelish seemed to be, the Faceless Men recognized the master of coin might prove a good ally to their cause. On his end, Petyr had found the perfect partner in crime: No One. A most discrete and powerful friend that was willing to give his life to create the ladder he had needed, chaos. 
___
Now confident that a party with much stronger motive than his would fall under blame should anything go wrong, Baelish seemingly started devoting his talents to their cause. Step by step and day after day, the Master of Coin put the Crown under a tremendous amount of debt, without ever being suspected. 
___
In the meantime, the Faceless Men had worked relentlessly to spark resentment and conflict amongst the great houses of Westeros. But here again, Littlefinger's help proved most valuable. His ideas and methods on how to turn powerful men against each other were proving far more effective. Before long, the Faceless Men had found themselves whispering the words of Littlefinger to the ears of Joffrey and other Lords.
___
Finally, when the Crown was millions and millions in debt, it was time to move. Jon Arryn had been poisoned and the King was visiting Winterfell to recrute his old friend, Ned Stark. On his end, Maester Luwin had succeeded in framing the Lannisters for attempted murder on Bran. And Ned had come to King's Landing to serve as Hand of the King.
___
Littlefinger had slowly led Ned into discovering the truth about Cersei's bastard children. Now, the Northerner was about to reveal the mascarade to the King as soon as he'd be back from hunting. No doubt Robert would have been furious and would have banished the Lannisters from court. Thus destroying the Crown's relation with Tywin Lannister. But however dramatic as this may sound, it would not have been of much consequence to the realm, as 6 out of the 7 Kingdoms were still as united as ever. The Faceless Men could not let that happen. 
___
Enters Jaqen H'Ghar. Without hesitation, Jaqen killed one of Robert's servants in the hunting party and stole his face. Under this disguise, he discreetly poured drugs into Robert's wine. And when his cup-bearer, Lancel Lannister inevitably served him more wine, the deed had been done. Robert started feeling dizzier than usual. It was the perfect moment for the Faceless Man to carry out his plan. Using his warging abilities, which all faceless men possess to some extent (in order to use the Faces), Jaqen H'Ghar had a boar charge towards a completely drunken and aging Robert. Resulting in his death and Ned Stark's imprisonment.


___
But this was not enough. For Chaos to erupt, Ned Stark's head had to fall. And with the help of Littlefinger whispering the right words to his ears, the Faceless Men convinced Joffrey to behead the Stark traitor.
___
Eddard Stark died and Jaqen H'Ghar had served the Many Faced God well. Given Jaqen's discretion and unparalleled set of skills, he could have easily gone out of King's Landing after Robert's murder. However, people would have found this suspicious. How come one of Robert's servants, that happened to be in his hunting party, had died or disappeared right after the King's death? It would have threatened everything the Faceless Man had worked for, in making the event look like an accident or a plot from the Lannisters.
___
But Jaqen was no fool. H'Ghar had killed an unnamed servant that had no family or ties to the city. And Littlefinger had carefully selected this man to join Robert's hunting escapade for this specific reason. First, Jaqen killed the servant, then stole his face and hid the body. Then he joined Robert's hunting party. Under this disguise, he poured the drug, sent the boar charging towards Robert, and returned to King's Landing with the rest of the group. In order to not raise any suspicion, *No One* kept on playing the role of the servant for another couple of days/weeks. 
___
After enough time had passed, to escape from King's Landing, Jaqen (now using his regular Face, the one we see in the show) had the body of the servant dragged into some corner of the city. Then, he pretended to have been the one mutilating the man. Littlefinger had a White Cloak arrest H'Ghar for murder. During his expeditious trial, Jaqen pleaded for mercy, and was allowed to join the Wall. On the other hand, no one had noticed or even cared that some unnamed servant of Robert's had gone missing from the court. These things happened too often to be worth noting. 
___
Little Finger had saved Jaqen and stolen a life from the God of Death. Therefore, a debt of life was owed. To repay Littlefinger for his help, the Faceless Man gave him an iron coin and left right after Ned's execution. 

*(This is the iron coin Baelish gives back to the Faceless Woman in s07e05, for her to die in his place)*  
___
No wonder Jaqen had found himself traveling with Arya. It was the safest way out of King's Landing, for anybody trying to flee from the beheading.

**Grand Maester Pycelle, the Healthiest 80 Year Old in Westeros** 
-

Now, a most intriguing man in King's Landing is Maester Pycelle, who, despite being in his eighties, is in an incredible shape, strong enough to even fake having trouble walking. 
___
Grand Maester Pycelle has been in service for forty years, beginning his tenure in the closing months of King Aegon V Targaryen's reign and maintaining the post for the entirety of the reigns of King Jaehaerys II, King Aerys II, King Robert, King Joffrey and even King Tommen Baratheon. That is a suspiciously long amount of time to have managed to stay in position while still holding his head.
___
Isn't it odd that Grand Maester is so healthy after all these years, despite not displaying any outstanding skill in medicine? Isn't it odd that he can be found in the company of prostitutes more often than Tyrion? Isn't it odd that he was the only man advising Aerys II to open the gates of King's Landing to Tywin Lannister? Allowing him to sack the city while everyone (Jaime, Varys, etc.) had been advising against it. Is it a coincidence that he never speaks to, or against Littlefinger, despite having sat on the small council for so long? And despite having no trouble criticizing Varys or Tyrion? Is it a coincidence that he seems to have absolutely no motive and seems perfectly contempt with his position?
___
*""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects."", Petyr Baelish.*
___
We know Littlefinger was plotting to start a conflict between Starks &amp; Lannisters, two of the strongest houses in the 7 Kingdoms. And we know it was at the initiative of the Faceless Men. We also know Littlefinger had a secret influence over Joffrey through the help of a third party. And that this someone else convinced Joffrey to behead Ned Stark rather than to show mercy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXSExXCnmNA&amp;t=997s).
___
What we haven't figured out is which person or lord the Faceless Man was impersonating to this end? Was there anyone Joffrey would even listen to?
___
The list of people that had the opportunity to speak to the young King was actually rather small. Neither Varys nor Cersei would have furthered Littlefinger's schemes. Joffrey did not care about his King's guard either. And it could not have been Littlefinger himself as he would never risk putting his name in the spotlight. All the blame would fall on him should anything go wrong. So who is left?
___
The answer was right under our noses all this time. There was only one man close enough to Joffrey's ears, that he would sometimes listen to: *Grand Maester Pycelle, ""Treason. Is. Treason.""*

___
The most influential Faceless Man in position was no one else than Pycelle himself. It was the perfect disguise for the servant of the Many Faced God. An old man, that would easily be impersonated by several generations of Faceless Men. Decade after decade, Maester Pycelle, with seemingly no motive, would always be standing at the right place at the right time. Always hearing about every single matter of value, and occasionally having a say on it.
___
Grand Maester Pycelle was the perfect cover for the Faceless Men and the perfect ally for Littlefinger. 

A 40 year long multi generational deception. Such was Grand Maester Pycelle's disguise. The real Pycelle however had been a corrupted Maester that had died in his fifties, like most men did during these times. At which point a Faceless Man had to pick up his face and persona, to further his mission: bringing Chaos to the 7 Kingdoms. This is why Pycelle looked 50 years old, despite being 85.
___
___
Pycelle once had a long white beard which he had been growing for decades and that he was very proud of. But when Tyrion had him arrested and had the beard shaved off, only wispy strands grew back. 

Now how odd is that? Have you ever heard of any man, young or old, with a fully grown beard in perfect shape, that would not grow back after being shaved only once?
___
One can imagine growing back a beard is no miracle, but growing hair back from the scalped face of a dead man? That is something else entirely (hence the wispy strands). Luckily for the Faceless Man wearing the mask of Pycelle, no one in the audience managed to pick it up, let alone in King's Landing.

___
In this deleted scene from season 4, Grand Maester explains his true motive to Tywin: *""So many flowers my Lord, each wanting to grow the tallest, bloom the brightest... And one by one, sooner or later, they all get plucked. I don't want to be the tallest, or the brightest. I only want to remain in the garden. Until my time comes to return to the dirt.""*, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMXJlUIQP94&amp;t=97s 
___
This was actually the truth from the Faceless Man playing Grand Maester Pycelle. His goal really is to stay in that garden. Except he did not follow up on what he intended to do with his long term position: working his hardest to see every tall and bright flower being plucked from the garden, until nothing but dirt remains.
___
It is also said that Pycelle was a colleague and supporter of Tywin Lannister since his tenure as Hand of the King. When Tywin marched to King's Landing following the Battle of the Trident, it was Pycelle who advised Aerys II to open the city gates, hoping that Tywin would seize the throne for himself. And like the Maester had said: ""I have served the interests of house Lannister unfailingly."", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMXJlUIQP94&amp;t=135s
___
To which Tywin replies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMXJlUIQP94&amp;t=130s (2:10 - 2:31), ""What have I done to earn this touching loyalty?"" Pycelle then retorks: ""You have build the strongest house"".
___
But Tywin was right. Why would someone that claims, his only goal is to ""remain in the garden until his time comes"" take risks and further the unpopular opinion?
___
Why would Pycelle advise Aerys II into opening the gates to Tywin when the popular opinion would have been not to? Why did he hope Tywin would seize the throne after Aerys's death, when it was clearly not the wisest choice for house Lannister or for the realm? 
___
The answer is because Pycelle had been furthering another agenda. Not one about peace, not one about the Lannisters, not one about the sustain of his confortable little life either, but one about Chaos. The Starks did not trust the Lannisters since Jaime had slayed his King. Let alone supporting them as ruler of the 7 Kingdoms. The Dornish had hated the Lannisters ever since Tywin had Elia and her children brutally murdered. Supporting Tywin was never the safest bet for Pycelle, it was the best move to ensure peace would not take hold in the 7 Kingdoms. 
___ 

And this is why D&amp;D gave us this brilliant scene in season 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT9HrLHruRU&amp;t=1130s (18:50 - 18:59) *""I told No One that I was offering [Myrcella] to the Dornish""* - had said Tyrion to Pycelle.

Tyrion had told no one indeed. Since No One is Grand Maester Pycelle, a most dedicated Faceless Man.

___
___
But even so, in his 40 years of tenure as Grand Maester, at some point, someone should have spotted Pycelle talking to one or two suspicious men. He could not have exclusively communicated through raven messaging all this time. And since he was Littlefinger's ally, someone had to have seen them exchanging at one point. Not too mention that if you take into account how powerful Varys's web of little birds is, Pycelle's conspiracy running unnoticed for four decades seems virtually impossible. 
___
So how did he do it? To understand that, we need to look at what Pycelle devots most of his time to: getting young ladies &amp; prostitutes into his chambers.
___
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT9HrLHruRU&amp;t=1320s (22:00 - 24:07) Pycelle talking to Ros after an intercourse;

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT9HrLHruRU&amp;t=1201s (20:01 - 20:08): Pycelle in the company of another prostitue when Tyrion arrests him and cuts his beard;

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT9HrLHruRU&amp;t=2176s (36:16 - 36:23) Pycelle talking to yet another young lady he is trying to lure into his chambers.

___
Grand Maester Pycelle, at +80 years old, seems to be spending more time with whores than Tyrion in his heydays. But given these are medieval times, what's the likelihood of this man not having died from a heart attack (or worse) at his age? Pretty slim, to say the least.
___
The Faceless Man Pycelle spent most of his time with prostitutes, not because he cared about the ladies. But because whores are one of the few people that can easily come and go, in and out of King's Landing.
___
And guess who happens to own the most notorious brothel in town? *Yours truly, Littlefinger.*
___
Baelish's brothels were the key passing point for any pleasure lady that would want to get in or out of King's Landing. Therefore, Pycelle never had to say a word to Littlefinger. All he had to do was pass his message along to a Faceless Woman disguised as a prostitute, that would then relay the information to Baelish.
___
On the other hand, Petyr's acquisition of the brothel was a key investment. It allowed him to be aware of most of the Faceless Men's movements in King's Landing.

___
Even when Pycelle's time had come, the Faceless Man playing the Maester stayed, and died, in character. Thus avoiding to raise any suspicion. Grand Maester Pycelle had proven a good servant to the Many Faced God. In his 40 years of tenure, the 7 Kingdoms had known 2 all out wars and rebellions and as many Kings as you can count.

___
All this time, only Petyr was aware of Pycelle's traitorous act. Unfortunately, he had chosen to side with the Faceless Men in their quest for Chaos.

-

Now, we've come to realize just how deep Littlefinger's deception was. Through the corrupted Maesters, he spread songs of chaos across the Kingdoms. And with the Faceless Men by his side, there was no place in Westeros his shadow would not reach. 
___
Thanks to the corrupted Maester Walys, Baelish even had a good understanding of Young Griff's destiny (the son of Rhaegar &amp; Lyanna, rightful heir to the Iron Throne). But what about Daenerys? Did Littlefinger allow the Mother of Dragons to run wild for years without caring?
___
Never. Knowledge is Power. And having an eye over the only owner of dragons in all of Essos and Westeros combined was paramount. For this job, Baelish counted on one disgraced bear, Jorah Mormont. 
___
___
Ser Jorah Mormont, former Lord of Bear Island, was once happily married with Lady Lynesse Hightower, of the very powerful House Hightower of Oldtown. Lynesse was used to the riches and luxury of the second-largest city in Westeros and came to find Bear Island primitive and crude. Jorah's attempts at pleasing his wife quickly led him to spend all of his money. Not long after, he had disgraced his name by arresting poachers and selling them to slavers. All in the hope of generating some wealth for the woman he loved. 
___
But slavery is illegal in Westeros. And before Eddard Stark had arrested the both of them, Jorah and Lynesse fled across the Narrow Sea to the Free City of Lys. Jorah attempted to make a living as a sellsword there. But he was unable to provide an acceptable income for Lynesse. As a result, she left him and moved into the manse of Tregar Ormollen, a Lysene merchant prince. Tregar threatened to enslave Jorah if he did not give up Lynesse. So the northman had no choice but to abandon his wife. Then, he left Lys for Volantis. There, he spent the better part of the year working as a sellsword and owning nothing but his sword.
___
After enough time had passed, Jorah realized there was nothing he would be able to do on his own: *""No one can survive in this world without help.""* Jorah to Daenerys.
___
He still loved his wife with all his heart. But he believed she deserved to be treated as a princess. To this end, he needed two things: obtain a royal pardon, be allowed in Westeros; &amp; amass a small fortune to claim back Lynesse and provide for her. 
___
Luckily for Jorah, a merchant-prince from Pentos, Illyrio Mopatis, was looking for a Westerosi knight to watch over Daenerys Targaryen. And in exchange for a little bit of spying on the side, Illyrio's good friend, Varys, was offering a royal pardon from King Robert.
___
Jorah could not refuse. His loyalty to his wife was everything to him.

- Viserys Targaryen: *""Does loyalty mean nothing to you?""*
- Jorah Mormont: *""It means everything to me.""*
- Viserys Targaryen: *""And yet here you stand.""*
- Jorah Mormont: *""And yet here I stand.""*

___
Even with all that, Mormont was not any closer to buying Lynesse back from the merchant prince of Lys. He needed gold, and a lot of it.
___
Guess who happens to be an extra wealthy Master of Coin in the 7 Kingdoms, whilst also being deeply connected to the corrupted Maesters of Oldtown (where Lynesse is from)? *Yours truly, Littlefinger.*
___
With the help of the corrupted Maesters &amp; the Faceless Men, reaching out to Mormont was not a problem for Baelish. And what were a few bags of gold, for the man that had put the Iron Throne into an astonishing debt of 6 million Gold Dragons? Compared to having a bird singing to the ears of Daenerys? On top of the money, Baelish was also offering a position of esteemed merchant, back in Westeros. All in exchange for information on Daenerys whereabouts and plans, just like Jorah was already doing for Varys anyways. 
___
But there was another odd condition attached to Littlefinger's proposal: he wanted Jorah to protect Dany, with his life if need be, and help her march back on Westeros.
___
Jorah did not understand why, but he was in no position to refuse the deal that could set him for life: *""The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They dont care what game the high lords play.""*  had said Jorah to Daenerys. He prayed for a bit of gold &amp; a bit of health these days.
___
The reason behind Littlefinger's unexpected gesture of altruism, was not because he cared about Dany, of course. But because her invading the 7 Kingdoms with dragons would be the best opportunity there is to create chaos, his favorite ladder.
___
On the other hand, the Children of the Forest, therefore the God of Death, therefore the Faceless Men &amp; the corrupted Maesters, were aligned with Bealish's ambitions. They also needed Dany alive and well to raise her dragons. And in time, she'd bring these dragons to Westeros and deliver them right to the Night King, North of the Wall *(see part 3, chapter ""A Shadow amidst Earth and Fire"", https://redd.it/89pzdp)*.
___
But Jorah couldn't possibly know or understand all that. So he agreed to become a triple agent: spying on Daenerys for both Varys &amp; Littefinger, while still protecting her. All for the love he bore his wife, Lynesse Hightower.
___
___
*""Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.""* had said Jorah to Viserys &amp; Daenerys during their first meeting.

Have no fear Jorah. You were serving Petyr Baelish all along. 

___

**An Unavoidable Outcome**
-

In the end, Ramsey foreshadowed it best: *""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4_Fefew78
___
Without any of the big players even noticing, at the end of the show, Littlefinger had become the most influential man in Westeros. Now supported by:

- The entire organisation of the Faceless Men; 

- The corrupted Order of the Maesters; 

- The Warden of the East and Lord Paramount of the Vale, Lord Robin Arryn; 

- The Martells, therefore Dorne, whom he had helped a great deal in plotting the downfall of the Lannisters: *credit to the Order of the Green Hand for this theory and for this series of videos*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-cRmQe_QHI&amp;t=2s . In this venture, Lady Tyene Sand, Oberyn's 4th daughter, acting under the disguise of Shae the prostitute, proved most reliable for Littlefinger (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoKSxuDJYk0&amp;t=762s). She was the perfect spy to extort information from Tyrion's bedroom. 

- Most of the little nobles &amp; other merchants of King's Landing were also supporting Littlefinger. As he had paid them generously during his tenure as Master of Coin, with the gold stolen from the Crown of course;

- Finally, the population of King's Landing was behind him: for killing the foreign invader, Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of the Mad King, and for saving them from a horde of barbaric Dothraki pillaging and raping their city to the ground.

___
In the end, his crowning was inevitable: Evil had won. The most active agent of Chaos, Littlefinger, had been rewarded with the Iron Throne. But do you really think Westeros would be enough for King Littlefinger? What was to stop him from avenging his Westerosi ""brothers"" and invading Essos in retaliation for the Dothraki decimating their lands?
___
Absolutely nothing. Littlefinger now had the support of all of the 7 Kingdoms (except maybe the Ironborn); he had access to the strongest network of spies, the Faceless Men; and he could freely consult with the Corrupted Maesters in strategic matters (as his desire for chaos aligned well with the will of their God of Death).
___
___
___

**The Despicable is Rewarded**
-

The White Walkers have been defeated and a lesser evil has triumphed over the 7 Kingdoms: Littlefinger. 
From part 1 to 3 of this series (https://redd.it/89plsa), we've managed to raise Baelish from the dead up to the Iron Throne. And this is where the show leaves us.
___
But what was the point? What was the message behind Littlefinger winning it all? Why not Jon? Why not Dany? Why not Tyrion or anyone else for that matter?
___
A great thing about Game of Thrones is how unpredictable and full of surprises it has been. This is a testament to George's writing ethics and overall genius. But in ASOIAF, every unexpected death was carefully orchestrated to fit a structure. Each served a purpose towards a grander meaning. 
___
And given what we know about Martin, the overall message behind *""who ended up on the Iron Throne""* had to be something deeper than a simple plot twist for the thrill of the unknown.
___
___
So let's think back, what happened to our favorite characters in GoT? Well, they all died. First, it was Ned Stark. Then it was Robb Stark. Then Oberyn. Then, Jon Snow... Though they did revive Jon, once.
___
But why did everyone lose their head while the creepy Littlefinger outlives them all? Is it so we never feel safe? Or is there something else to it?
___
GRRM started writing A Song Of Ice And Fire in response to Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", which magnified the fight between good vs evil. George has said that *""in real life, because you are good, you do not get everything you want.""* And when asked *""if [...] Jon [was] the hero of this story, [he answered] that he is not*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNPCGcfcBbA&amp;t=396s   
___
George has been trying to tell us that there are two mistakes that will end up costing our lives in GoT: 

- **Lack of Knowledge**: Forming an opinion without sufficient information is asking for trouble; and acting under its influence is gambling with your life;  

- &amp; **Strong Feelings**: Strong convictions act as as a veil that will blur your judgement: deep love, pride, honor, fanaticism, or any other form of radical thoughts are not good things for your reason.

___
And when you take time to reflect on what happened to each character, you'll realize everything can be connected to these two ideas:

- Jamie tried to kill Bran out of love and passion for Cersei.

- Lyanna created a political disaster by falling in love with Rhaegar.
 
- Ned got his head chopped off by following his unwavering faith in the law: *""Stannis is the rightful heir and must be crowned King"". Which is ironic since Ned himself had soiled his honor by re-marring with Catelyn Tully and had deprived his heir, Jon Snow (born of Ned's first marriage with Ashara) from his rightful claim to Winterfell, just so he could win the war against Aerys II.*

- Stannis got himself killed for blindly obeying the law and pursuing the Iron Throne. Not because he wanted it. But because it ""was his by right"".

- The most obvious example of all, Robb Stark, brought the Red Wedding to himself and indirectly killed his men and his family by desperately falling in love with Talisa. The destiny of all Northern people and the outcome of the war against Joffrey rested heavily on his alliance with the Freys but he did not have the strength to simply marry the Frey girl for political reasons and keep Talisa on the side as his true love. All because he was utterly blinded by honor and love.

- Lord Tywin Lannister got himself killed out of pride (rejecting Tyrion and sentencing him to death, just because he was ashamed of a dwarf carrying the Lannister banners).

- Prince Oberyn Martell, got his face brutally crushed in a fight he had won, blinded by the need for justice and revenge against the people that had murdered his beloved sister, Elia.

- Dany died because her passions get the best of her when she is upset (seeking imminent revenge for Jon's death).

- Arya has been consumed by hatred for too many years to survive.

- And Jon Snow's lack of knowledge is his doom: *""You know nothing, Jon Snow""*, had foreshadowed Ygritte. He is everything that is good in humanity and in this world. But the poor Stark does not use his brain much. And even his many angels could never build enough plot armor to keep him alive: Arthur Dayne (Mance Rayder), his King's Guard companions (Qhorin Halfhand &amp; Tormund Giantsbane), Jeor Mormont, Bran as the Lord of Light &amp; even Bran as the Night King. 

- Finally, Bran's lack of knowledge is the reason all this mess started in the first place. Had he realized only him being turned into a White Walker could have created the Night King, none of this would have happened and Bran would still be alive by the end of this tale. Though you have to remember he was still a kid when the TER reached out to him.

___
So it seems everybody dies in this story... 
___
Even Littlefinger almost got killed out of love for Catelyn: by putting himself a fight where he had absolutely no business being (dual vs. Brandon Stark when he was 15). Catelyn had no interest in him but he could not do the rational thing and move on due to his obsessive love for her.

However, because Catelyn was the only woman Littlefinger had ever loved and because she rejected him to follow her duty, his judgement was never again blurred by the veil that is strong love. Ironically, this is the key event that allowed Petyr to survive for so long. From this moment on, he stopped using his heart as much in his decisions and turned into one of the most realistic and calculating people in Westeros. Thus the mantra: *""Knowledge is Power""*. 
___
Baelish is one of the few that never did a step forward without the right information or under the influence of strong feelings. This is why he remains standing in the end, to keep on furthering his own agenda: which is really keeping his head on his shoulders while everyone else's is falling.
___
The selfish, despicable, manipulative and ambitious, with a heart colder than a White Walker's, has been rewarded with the Iron Throne in the end. 
___
___
By having Littlefinger sit on the Irone Throne, George is telling us what the winning formula is in life: *Don't act before you have all the information &amp; Do not let strong convictions/feelings blur your judgement and blind you from the truth.*

Because if all of us do, who knows who might end up ruling in the end?
___
___
This is what GRRM has been doing with prophecies as well. Making some prophecies be true to bait us into thinking Azor Ahai is the key to everything. Only to have it never be real in the end. 

All of this has been put together to help us experience how, if we are not careful, we too, can jump into the wrong conclusions. Just like Melisandre and the followers of the Lord of Light did and have been blamed for. Are we fanatics for believing in the Savior then?

___
___
___
**""Everything""**
-

But there is one more layer to this story. 
___
___
In season 4, when Sansa asked Littlefinger what he wanted, he replied: *""Everything""*, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhI0KqNNTw&amp;t=134s (2:14 - 2:30). And in ASOIAF, we never get a Point of View chapter from Baelish's perspective, so no one knows what he thinks.
___
But what could Baelish possibly have meant by that? 
___
As the seasons progress, we learn from Littlefinger that his goal is to sit on the Iron Throne, with Sansa by his side: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WgsCx7TwM&amp;t=57s (00:57 - 1:37). That's not such a big reveal, isn't it? Varys had figured ages ago Littlefinger wanted to sit on the Iron Throne. And his obsession for Catelyn was well known. So it would not be a big surprise for any of the players to learn that Baelish was creeping at Sansa's doorstep. Oberyn knew, Cersei knew, Tywin knew, Olenna knew, even Renly knew about his ambitious nature. And all assumed Littlefinger was not a threat as he was too little a player to have any impact anytime soon.
___
But in season 4, Baelish explains to Sansa how a wise schemer acts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhI0KqNNTw&amp;t=97s (1:37 - 1:50) ***""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.""***
___
Sansa was still a teenager so it's understandable she would not have figured out Baelish wanted the Iron Throne. But what about the other players? Everybody that was anybody in King's Landing knew who Littlefinger was and what is ambitions were: gain as much power as possible, even rule the 7 Kingdoms if it's in the cards.
___
If that was the case, then Baelish had been nothing short of a fool. Lucky enough to have ended up on the Iron Throne but a fool nonetheless. As he would have failed to follow his own advice from the very beginning. 
___
But what were the odds of someone being this lucky, this long? Pretty narrow, isn't it. 
___
What if there was something else? What if Littlefinger was not a fool but the one fooling us all along? What if his ambitious and scheming persona was actually a cover? What if his ""foes"" where not the Starks or the Lannisters? What would ""everything"" mean then?
___
___
___
**A Nest of Spies**
-

In *""A Candle of Corruption""*, *""The Shadow of the Mickingbird""* &amp; *""Grand Maester Pycelle, the Healthiest 80 Year Old in Westeros""*, we've presented King's Landing as being riddled with Faceless Men. While Oldtown and the Citadel have been infiltrated by the league of assassins for centuries: Faceless Men have been recruiting Maesters into their ranks ever since. 
___
What better place than the Citadel could *No One* hope for to find new allies? Most of its adherents are poor peasants, bastards and other men whose families have disowned them. It is the perfect Order to find a never-ending pool of potential recruits. 
___
In the meantime, we've stated that the God of Death has charged the Faceless Men and the corrupted Maesters to break the peace of the 7 Kingdoms and plunge the realm into Chaos. This is the mission both Maesters and Faceless Men have dedicated their lives to, for entire generations.
___
In *""Valar Morghulis""* (https://redd.it/89pzdp), we've introduced the God of Death/Many Faced God the Faceless Men serve, as being the Children of the Forests in disguise. But neither the Faceless Men nor the corrupted Maesters know this. They all serve his divine command without question (Valar Dohaeris). And given that the Children had planned on releasing the Night King on mankind, they needed to keep Westeros as divided as possible (hence The Dance of the Dragons, Robert's Rebellion, the War of the 5 Kings). Therefore, most of the chaotic events happening in the past 500 years can be connected to the Children's effective and credulous servants, the Faceless Men and the corrupted Maesters. Successfully orchestrating the fall of dynasties from the shadows (with some help from the Children, from time to time).
___
And that folks, is the state of King's Landing in which Petyr Baeslish sets foot in, when he is appointed Master of Coin by Jon Arryn.
___
On one hand, you have Varys relentlessly plotting for the return of the Blackfyres, with his net of little birds. On the other hand, you have Pycelle, the Faceless Man, scheming to bring Chaos to the realm with a network of spies far superior and more powerful than Varys's: skilled assassins and maesters that had been serving the God of Death for centuries.
___
Lastly, you have the side of the ignorants. A King (Robert Baratheon) so drunk he would not remember what you had talked about the day before. Other Lords so infatuated with their titles and ambitions that they were too oblivious to acknowledge the threat of the White Walkers. Even when Ser Alliser Thorne brought the hand of a wight in front of their eyes. 
___
Now if you think you would get laughed at for talking about White Walkers, try being Baelish telling these noble Lords their court was filled with third party assassins, that had been spying and influencing their fates for generations. Magical men that could take anyone's appearance without you ever noticing, even after said Faceless Man had been killed. You would be ridiculed upon and put out of a job in moments, that is, if you were lucky enough to still hold your head after any of the Faceless Men had learned about it.
___
So what could a wise and knowledgeable Maester of Coin like Petyr do then? What could one man with no physical training, no lands, no gold and no power do against legions of dedicated and coordinated fanatics? 
___
The answer is: Nothing. 
___
___
___
**The Mask of Petyr**
-

He couldn't possibly. The only way he could have done anything about this conspiracy is if he were more powerful than both the current King and the organization of the Faceless Men &amp; the Citadel combined. Now, that is aiming high.
___
And if you can't beat them, join them.
___
First, Baelish had to make sure he would not to stand out. To this end, he put on the persona that would be least suspicious in court: *Littlefinger*. What's more common in King's Landing than the unscrupulous/ambitious rat that would do anything for titles and gold? Absolutely nothing, as this is literally 90% of the people at court. 
___
Under this facade, Petyr could start moving around. He quickly saw through Maester Pycelle's performance and offered him his help in creating chaos in the 7 Kingdoms. After explaining to the Faceless Man he had been looking for opportunities to climb the ladder. Petyr had found himself a most powerful ally. One that was dedicated to creating the business opportunity Baelish had needed, Chaos.  
___
On the other hand, this young and ambitious Master of Coin might have proven a useful ally for Grand Maester Pycelle. Therefore, he entrusted Petyr with discretely putting the Crown into debt. A task in which he brilliantly succeeded. 
___
Step by step and year after year, Petyr was proving a very valuable ally for the Faceless Men. And after 17 years, his talents at manipulating Lords had helped the God of Death's cause a great deal in turning Starks vs Lannisters &amp; Baratheons. To the point where the Faceless Men and Pycelle were now relying on his plans and on his schemes most of the time, and were whispering his words that would always prove effective.
___
In the meantime, on rare occasions, Petyr would have is ambitious facade, Littlefinger, reveal his ""true"" motive:
___
First to Varys: *""Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.""*, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4&amp;t=128s (2:08 - 2:23) ;
___
Then to the mighty Tywin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9jac7Qg9w4&amp;t=170s (2:50 - 3:06) *""It is my belief that a moment of chaos offers opportunities lost soon after.""* 

To which the cunning Lannister replied: *""You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?""*
___
Tywin was absolutely right. There is nothing unique nor brilliant about proudly spouting about ""Chaos being a ladder"". And if this was his real motivation, he had done a poor job at hiding his intentions, hadn't he?
___
Both Varys &amp; Tywin knew the truth about his motive since he had been telling them, in these moments of *""confidence""*. As a result, Petyr would have failed to follow his own advice: *""Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."" - Baelish*
___
But what if this wasn't Petyr's true motivation? 
___
To whom does Littlefinger speak to when he talks about Chaos? To other major players. He doesn't talk about this with Sansa. He only repeats it to the people he needs to confuse. 
___
And what better way not to raise suspicions than to have everyone believing your true nature and your true motive are as common as it could possibly get: ""I am just another ambitious and unscrupulous man, among hundred others at court"", albeit slightly more cunning than the average.
___
With this perfect facade, Petyr had every single person in the 7 Kingdoms and in the audience confused to their core. No one would even dare suspect he had other intentions without calling themselves crazy.
___
And like Petyr said: *""What we don't know is usually what gets us killed,""* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JofBlnXsACg&amp;t=158s (2:38 - 2:45). Not knowing Baelish might get his ennemies killed. Except his foes were not the Starks nor the Lannisters.

___
___
___
**A 25 Year Long Deception, Littlefinger**
-

Instead of getting silently murdered by a Faceless Man for being on their way or replaced from his position for spouting ridiculous accusations against eminent figures such as Pycelle (a servant of the God of Death that had worked for 40 years to destroy the realm), Petyr had chosen to greatly contribute to their cause. Thus starting the War of the Five Kings. 
___
But it was not for nothing. For 17 years, Petyr did put the Crown in debt like the Faceless Men had wanted. Except all the gold he had borrowed, he put in his pockets. And from his pockets, he transferred the money to skilled and trustworthy individuals that he appointed into as many positions as possible in King's Landing. Most of these men were neither lords, nor nobles, so nobody paid much attention to them.
___
On the other hand, he had gained access to the strongest network of spies in all of Essos and Westeros combined, the Faceless Men. And by the time the War of the Five Kings had started, he had them whispering his words as if they were his servants. All to help him reach his next milestone, the Iron Throne. 
___
But behind the disguise of the ambitious little Lord, Petyr had learned a great deal about the ways of the Faceless Men and about the corrupted Maesters. Slowly but surely, he had mapped out who they were, where they were being recruited from, and to which end.
___
*""Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."" - Baelish*
___
The facade Littlefinger, the ambitious little Lord that strives under Chaos, was paying dividends for Petyr. By the time the war of the 5 Kings was over, he had found himself entitled Lord of Harrenhal, betrothed to Lysa Arryn, wealthier than the Lannisters, and supported by the strongest network of spies the world had ever known. And in exchange for his fantastic services, he was even gifted an Iron Coin by the Faceless Men.
___
Now, Littlefinger and the Faceless Men had moved on to their next scheme in their quest for Chaos: turning the North against the Lannisters.
___
The rest is history. In season 7, Baelish gives the iron coin to the Faceless Woman that dies in his place and heads back to King's Landing where all the people he had appointed in various positions would support him. Not to mention the Faceless Men and the corrupted Maesters.
___
In season 8, the army of the dead is defeated after a miraculous move from Bran/Night King that saves Mankind. And Petyr Baelish is crowned King for saving King's Landing from the foreign invader, Daenerys Targaryen.
___
___
At this point, the Children of Westeros had almost gone extinct after having sacrificed the last of their own in order to release the Night King. But the God of Death was not done whispering to his faithful servants: *Valar Morghulis, All men must be killed.* 
___
There are other species of Children of the Forests throughout the world (e.g. the moon singers). Rest assured that men annihilating their Westerosi brothers was horrific news for their kind. They needed to do everything in their power to fight Man.
___
To that end, their new pones had already been put in place. First, the moon singers' greenseers had been forwarding visions to Lord Robin Arryn since he was a child (hence the seizures Robin has when sitting on his weirwood throne). Just like the Three Eyed Raven once did with Jojen Reed, frying a small part of his brain in order to transfer visions into his non greenseer body. The goal was to turn Robin into the next Euron.
___
Secondly, they had an ace on the Iron Throne, an ally that had been most loyal to the God of Death for decades, Littlefinger. And now that he was King, he would be the perfect piece to create more Chaos. Not only within the 7 Kingdoms, but also on a grander scale, in Essos and beyond.
___
___
___
**The Hero That Fought Darkness**
-


After being named King, Petyr knew their would be no escaping the worshipers of the God of Death. Either follow the corrupted Maesters' orders and bring more death to mankind. Or refuse and be disposed of by the Faceless Men.
___
But the Mastermind had found himself in the perfect position to unravel his grand plan: a 25 year long deception.
___
After peace had settled in Westeros and the Kingdoms had recovered, King Baelish prepared his troops for a much bigger war, the invasion of Essos (just like the Children had hoped). However, while pretending to gather his Knights for war, Petyr actually armed and supported a most secretive organization: *The ancient Order of the Green Hand*. A league of trustworthy knights (such as Arthur Dayne/ Mance Ryder) that had been secretly fighting the Children of the Forest for thousands of years. 
___
Without ever blowing his cover, Petyr's vast knowledge about the Faceless Men organization: their tunnels, ways, lairs, associates and disguises; allowed the Order of the Green Hand to rid Westeros from its corrupted Maesters and from the Faceless Men in disguise. With the support of King Petyr and the key information he had provided, the Order was able to operate as discretely as the Faceless Men would have. But this time, discretion was against them. 
___
After 25 years, Petyr had finally found himself in a position where he could help the realm save itself from the shadow of the Many Faced God of Death, from its corrupted Maesters and from the Faceless Men. 

___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhI0KqNNTw&amp;t=97s (1:37 - 1:50) *""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.""*
___
So in the end, the greatest deception Petyr ever pulled was convincing Men, Children and Faceless Men alike that he was just another unscrupulous man, with only motive: ambition. Under this disguise, he could do more for Westeros than any other hero would have ever done. 
___
Just like Baelish had foreshadowed: *""The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.""*, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JofBlnXsACg (3:28 - 3:32). This time, he was the little hero. The Little Finger.

___
Ironically, like the legend stated, Azor Ahai was the hero chosen to defeat the darkness of the Great Other. Though Petyr had not been chosen by R'hllor or any other god, but out of necessity by a bunch of lying politicians. And instead of killing himself in the fight against the White Walkers, the darkness he defeated was the shadow of the Faceless Men &amp; of the corrupted Maesters, cast upon Westeros for centuries by the Great Other (the God of Death/ the Children of the Forest). After all, Petyr really was *""Azor Ahai, the hero that defeated darkness.""* 

But History would remember the lie of his vanquishing the Night King instead. While the truth would be forgotten to allow Petyr to protect the realm from its shadows.
___
___
*""There is no justice in this world, unless we make it.""* - Petyr Baelish to Sansa Stark
___
While this quote looked like it referred to Man, the true meaning behind these words had always been: *""There is no justice in this world, unless [you and I, as King &amp; Queen], make it.""*
___
In Harper Lee's 1960 classic entitled *To Kill a Mockingbird,* it is a sin to kill these birds. Because Mockingbirds are not harmful.
___
The Mockingbird symbolizes Innocence; in addition to Goodness and Beauty. 
___
** ***Mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy*** *. They dont eat up peoples gardens, dont nest in corncribs,* ***they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us*** *.* - http://facingtoday.facinghistory.org/what-does-it-mean-to-kill-a-mockingbird
___
If you take time to look back at everything Petyr has ever done, with all of this knowledge and after putting aside any strong feeling you might harbor, you will realize everything he has ever done, was nothing but to protect Westeros and mankind (big picture wise). And he succeed in it.


___
___
The End.

*In other parts of the world, the Children of the Forests had not been found yet. Nor were they defeated. And as long as they would breath, there would be hope for the Children to punish Man for his sins.* *Valar Morghulis.*

My logic is twisted up a bit and I need some help -

After Robert dies, Ned quickly tells Varys to nix the hit on Dany. Varys tells him that it's too late. 

... But of course, we know Varys is a Targ loyalist. Cut to Jorah finding out he's been granted a pardon, which tips him off that he's not needed, and Dany is probably about to be killed. He of course stops the merchant from selling the poison wine and, hooray.

My question - what was Varys' contingency plan if Jorah didn't have this change of heart? Did he possibly just set up a botched hit from the beginning and say, never poison the wine to begin with? Or was he just all-in on Viserys at that point, and didn't care if Dany died? For such a cunning dude, I'm having a hard time figuring out how he played both sides (told the Council he would have her assassinated, but not actually do it). Did he just suspect Jorah would have a change of heart? I was always under the impression that took everyone by surprise, even Jorah himself.

Varys has been a significant character throughout the seasons, there is definitely something up with his plot, possibly a big twist, scenes like [this one](https://youtu.be/cudxwhDO0gQ?t=1m44s) make me believe that his goals are far deeper than we think.

Conclusion: There is definitely a twist about Varys

However, the twist can't be about the genuinety of his love to the people, that would be a horrible plot since his loyalty to the realm and to the people are somehow confirmed to be legitimate.

That leaves no options left but to predict that the twist will be about the 'means' to his goals. Connecting that conclusion with his plan in early season to bring a Targaryan to Westeros, to take over a peaceful King's Landing back then. That leaves me to think that Varys is a believer in chaos solving problems.

So 

My Theory is the following:

Varys had a hand in all of those recent wars and important deaths. His well planned strategy was to eliminate all those with a claim to the Throne; all the Baratheons, the Lannisters, the Targaryans, and possibly all other great houses as well. His ultimate goal is to break the wheel, to finally end monarchies in Westeros once and for all.

Assuming that Daenerys will be the winner of the Game, sitting on the Iron Throne. I expect that Varys will walk straight to her and stab her, he will be the one finishing the last surviving heir, before proceeding to poison her last dragon(s) and kill her baby as well. 

Something like this: ""Sorry my queen, I had to do what I had to do for the good of the people. I have no doubt that you were the better ruler out there, that you would be kind and just, that your rule would bring peaceful days to this land. But what about your child? and the child after him? And the stronger conquerors that may rise against them? It's time for this stupid Game to end."" 

Basically Varys starts a new free age in Westeros where people elect their rulers.

It is also where so many seeds were planted, noticed only in hindsight. 

Particularly, the conversation between Tyrion and Jon which foreshadows the theory that Tyrion, too, is part Targaryen. Without narration, the show misses the last sentences (Chapter 5, Book 1) that close out the interaction: 

""Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs."" And with that he (Tyrion Lannister) turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood as tall as a king.

But that's not Cersei. At this point she's a mix of power, desperation, madness, revenge and I think Light of the seven song shows it perfectly. 

It starts off quite tender and sad and beautiful with some haunting harmonies in there. I think that's the core of Cercei, or at least of young Cersei. She has experienced a lot of sad things that have left her damaged. She lost her mother when she was young, her father became distant, as a kid she was prophecised to have terrible events in her future, which made her paranoid for life, her Sansa-like dreams got shattered when her king husband turned out to be an abusive drunk, she couldn't really be with the man she loved, or at least loved in her own way. Her theme might be quiet, even tender in the beginning, but it's always somewhat tense, the phrases seem to hang in the air, never really finishing, some notes sound off, weird. Cercei is never at peace, she's always paranoid, unhappy, maybe longing for something. Then we hear the boys' choir singing the especially haunting melodies, which I think references her kids, especially the boys. She loved her kids, but she lost them to the game and her own broken nature. Then quiet mixes with a fast restless version of her theme and the Game of Thrones theme. She's empty yet she keeps playing, fighting. Organ joins in (as the largest, loudest instrument there is I'd say it symbolizes power), the song becomes louder and louder, until the Game of Thrones theme dominates, because that's the only thing left for Cercei, that's the only thing that truly matters now. And she's winning.

I think this song really captures the tragic side of Cersei, the constant restlessness, paranoia and even trauma and abuse that turned her gentler self into the cold, sadistic, power hungry person we know.

I don't think she's known happiness since early childhood (except maybe when her kids were born), that's probably what she's longing for and she thinks power will give her that, especially since she never really had a say in the bad things that happened to her when she was younger. She probably felt powerless against her mother's death, her domineering father, her abusive husband, her love for her brother and the overall limitations she had simply for being a woman in that world (e.g. after Jaime became kingsguard Tyrion would be the legal heir of Casterly Rock). So power became her ultimate goal in hopes of finding happiness and fulfillment with it. Which is ironic considering that she lost everyone she loved while going after that power.",5,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Who promised what to whom and for which purpose?**

The usual idea that a prince is going to fight the Night king (NK) and bring back normal things is in my opinion too simple and shit. I think:

1. **Who**: it was the lord of light (LL).
2. **Whom**: it was LL's opponent. It was NK's god.
3. **What**: it was a replacement of NK or something that can bear NK a son. I think NK and his WW can not reproduce by themselves if they are given wives. 
4. **Which**: it was an item in the peace treaty between LL and NK's god. 

If true, there is one simple end: a son from a specific family line or name has to be delivered to NK. A child of Jon and Danny looks to be a perfect match. Or gilly's son or (unlikely) Cersei's son?

Child of Jon and Danny is a good match because

1. That child is from fire, from a targaryan woman.
2. That child is also a stark. Grandson of lyanna stark. And NK seems to be a stark or related to them.
3. This is what a song of fire and ice looks like.

This idea kills much of the story: the roles of Bran and Melisandre become unimportant. Bran can be saved: he was/is instrumental in bringing humans and NK to negotiation table and he is like the bloodraven (a judge to make sure the peace treaty is not violated). Melisandre is a mystery.",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. First In my opinion and according to Country I live in India we almost have most such houses. Let me tell how it fits.

Lannisters- Professional way of doing things which are found in western part of my country (Gujarat). Play games with words. Also some qualities of Tyrells are found in these people. Also they are foodie. They say they pay there debts but never. It's other way round. They put in debts on to others as well as their enemies

Starks- These are rich farmers in North part of my country. Yes they are slow minds with High tempers. Also include Boltons, Karstarks type of people etc. 

Martells- Again in West part(Rajasthan) Exotic lifestyle. 

Baratheons- This are found in western part below(Maharashtra). They have their unique way. They speak out loud. Also relate some way to Punjab

Targaryens - Not found. 

These is not complete

We'd call it incest, what they'd done,  
but they pled sibling love,  
and caught by Bran in flagrante,  
dispatched him with a shove.  


Poor Bran was broke and comatose.  
The Starks were all distressed.  
Yet Ned and girls still rode off south,  
with Bran prescribed bed-rest.  


Prince Joffrey was a teenage brat  
betrothed to Sansa Stark,  
whose sister caused a wee affray  
that ended Direwolf's bark.  


When Arya sparred with butcher's boy,  
the bully drew his sword.  
Her Direwolf bared its teeth on wrist  
and bit the little coward.  


That Cersei's wrath was seen to show,  
was telling, while the son,  
although the firstborn bound to rule,  
was cruel; ask anyone.  


Nymeria fled the scene, which meant  
that Lady faced instead  
a proxy death; a sacrifice,  
administered by Ned.  


Bran hadn't fallen to his death,  
but for his Direwolf's teeth,  
he would've been disposed of by  
a dagger's lifeblood thief.  


Assassin lost his throat to wolf  
as Catelyn faced him game.  
A long, blonde hair from in the tower  
suggested who to blame.  


Awake, but with no memory,  
Bran, left to lie in bed,  
saw Catelyn (Mum) rush off darn sarf  
to tell the tale to Ned.  


She met her childhood friend, Baelish,  
who fingered for the deed  
the impish dwarf of Lannister,  
the uncorrupted seed.  


And on the way back home t'North,  
she met by chance the Gnome,  
in Crossroads Inn (a posh Motel),  
and seized him on her own.  


She brought him to her sister's place  
through Mountains of the Moon,  
to Eyrie, that's the Vale stronghold,  
from ancient mountain hewn.  


The widow, Lysa, suckled still   
an eight-year-old boy heir.  
No children were abused to put  
this programme on the air.  


The Imp was left exposed to fear  
in sky-cell's open air.  
The sloping floor was just too much;  
that wasn't really fair.  


A trial by combat then ensued.  
Sure, Tyrion knew the score.  
Ser Vardis lost to champion, Bronn,  
who hoofed him out Moon Door.  


When honest Ned refused diktat  
to kill an unborn child,  
it pissed off Rob Baratheon;  
his anger wasn't mild.   


Ned resigned and changed his mind  
when Robert told him, Woah,  
you'll be the Regent for a while,  
while I go hunting boar.  


When Ned set out to trace a crime,  
encouraged by the guy  
with fingers in so many pies,  
he failed to ask him, Why?  


Ned found out things that Jon Arryn  
had found out once before,  
like where the king's own bastards lived,  
conceived of various whores.  


When Jaime and the Kingsguard's men  
demanded, Free the Imp,  
poor Ned was hurt beneath his horse  
resulting in a limp.  


But undeterred, Ned carried on,  
and found out more bad things,  
like Joffrey and his siblings were  
the offspring of the twins.

(exception to Bravos of course). Amidst all this chaos and war in Westeros and every character playing some part in it I often spare a thought for Daario Naharis and imagine what him and his second sons are up to, just chilling in Meereen making sure no one starts an uprising I'd guess. This, however, begs the question, will we see him and Essos again? If I remember rightly the army of the Dead do not venture outside of Westeros for obvious reasons (although the Night King could fly over? But that's another conversation) and so it's probably safe to assume he's safe from 'winter', also it's unlikely the writers would create a subplot of a rebellion in one of Essos' cities because who wants to see that? We have the living v the dead to get on with. If they do feature at all I believe they will be called over as reinforcements to help in the war, but then that begs the question, who will watch over Dany's territory in their absence?

EDIT: Just read an interesting idea that maybe the Narrow Sea could completely freeze over, and 'Winter' could cross over? They'd have the resources of dead Westerosi's at their disposal and I also learnt that cities far east in Essos (Yi-Ti I believe it's called) also have stories of ""the Long Night"" so maybe they're preparing for their own battle on the other side of the planet? So interesting to consider all the possibilities, they could even make a complete spin off of the distant cities battles with Winter and how they coped with it.",14,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

- NK &amp; Jon 1v1

- Jon confronting Arya over her behavior towards Sansa last season and the bag of faces, weather they retcon her behavior by having Arya explain she was testing sansa or have her try to justify her behavior in some other way that makes her look more like...well...how people reacted to her behavior towards Sansa last season

- Jaime killing Cersei

- Time Jump

- Battle at the Trident flashback

- Bronn and Pod spraying

Shortly before Bran wakes from his coma, after he fell from the tower, Sansas Direwolf Lady was sentenced to execution. As we know from later seasons, Bran is a Warg (someone who can shift into animals and control them), and I believe that because of this power he is awoken literally by the death of Lady. 
Bran has a strong connection to the animals, and the death of a animal as important as a Direwolf may have influenced his awakening - directly after Lady dies, Bran wakes up and sits up in bed. 

I think that this is just a little bit of foreshadowing for his powers later on in the seasons and maybe shows his first instance of this ability. ",12,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

Bronn wants to switch sides and wanted Podrick to pass a secret message to Tyrion and Dany. There are several reasons I feel Bronn would switch sides

Tyrion and Bronn are friends. I feel Bronn would rather work for his friend than the Lannister's. 

Bronn is a betting man and will choose whatever side is likely to win. Bronn was there when Dany's army attacked Lannister troops. He knows the Scorpion failed to take down the dragon. If he switches sides and Dany wins, which is likely he knows Tyrion will pay him well. ",16,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

Robert Baratheon: There was that one...oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca, with the great big tits you could bury your face in?
Ned Stark: Bessie. She was one of yours.
Robert Baratheon: Bessie!' Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits! Yours was, uh...Aleena? No, you told me once. Uh...Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
Ned Stark: Wylla.
Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Ned Stark: Nor will I.
Robert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear, if I weren't your king, you'd have hit me already.

I have been rewatching Season one and following Ned's reactions to things that touch on his own actions that, unknowingly to those involved, can be considered treason. Such as hiding and raising the Targ heir as his own bastard child. Ned emotionally reacting to Robert declaring his desire to kill all the Targaryens, Robert going on about his beloved Lyanna, etc.

Now that Jon has been outed to the audience as not just a Targ, but their legal heir, small pieces of dialogue hold so much more meaning. Robert once knew what this woman who ""made [Ned] forget his honor"" looked like, as it was Ned's sister and his own fiance. Although, by his own confession, he no longer remembers what she looked like. 

And Ned's words, ""Nor will I."" He never will because it could very possibly end in death for Jon, and reveal Ned's own treasonous actions. This scene is even more poignant as it was followed by Robert attempting to console Ned, unknowingly, for treasonous actions against himself. ",7,33,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Could he have wrote it or not? What do you think? Please comment, even if you dislike. I am interested in any kind of opinion.**

""No one walks away from you, sister. That's what you told me. You put your Mountain Clegane between you and my freedom, beloved twin. Sister, you blew up the sept of Baelor in order to save yourself, not Tommen, and you sacrificed him! I've wondered since, what it is that drives you.

Fear, it is? Never!

Love it is? No.

Hatred and anger? Actually, I wouldn't say so.

It is your instinct. The same instinct that made Margery, the little Queen, suspicious, like you can see on the tapes. Watch yourself \(S6E10\) and look at her in the replay and see how she can smell and taste and feel the evil things that are about to come for her. And they came for her and her weak little Lauris, thanks to you, sister. And for a lot of scumbag of the city..

Sister, you must admit finally that winter came for us, too. I don't think you can fight the Starks and the Targaryen bitch on your own. When I rode north, snow fell on the capital and, I am quite sure, this night will be dark and full of terrors... and errors, on our enemies' side.

Cersei, you are always proudly telling me that you learnt from father, sitting there in your golden cloaks, my fair lady.

I leave you now to your Golden Company and to your vicious husband from the Iron Islands. When he beats your pride out of you, think of me please and know this: I do not care. At all. Think of what Viserys told Daenerys in Season One one hand to her cheek full of brotherly love in his eyes.. I tell you: Euron and the Whole Golden Company could have you, as long as I get what I finally deserve, as Kingslayer. The throne where the king sat whom I slaught. It is obvious, isn't it?

I am riding north now thinking about the fights and the whores and the Night King and I am thrilled to fight the most monstrous beasts while you betray the cause of those alive.

Forget about all I wrote before, it was nonsense and full of YOUR poisonous mind, not mine: I hate you, sister. But still, I love you. And I hope that, at the end of the Great War, we will both be alive and well and standing on the same side. I do not want to be your enemy.

# Dear Cersei,

# 

we've known each other for quite a while now and I feel like we are quite close. Even though I am so far north now.

Your mind, your thoughts, what makes you happy and what makes you angry... it's like all of that is an open book to me now.

I am your little dove, remember? 

When you asked me about my bleeding in the first time sitting there next to my mother, Katelyn Stark. Do you still remember the tone of your own voice? No? I do. 

Do you still know how embaressed she was by your words and the way she looked at me in worry? You knew it and you loved every second of it. 

I can still recall the glancing in your eyes. The way you smirked at my family when we stood there in a row, when you let my father kiss your hand.

The only one who withstood you was King Robert, the one who never fathered your bastard born of incest, King Joffrey, my beloved king. 

Robert is dead now, because you killed him. My father and mother are dead now, because your family killed them.

I almost died and went through hell, at first in Kingslanding and then back home at Winterfell where your vicious servant Ramsay tortured me. Both of them are dead, I am afraid to remind you. I  even saw Ramsay been eaten up by his own dogs. Not a nice thing to look at.

Revered Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, not long ago I told a man you know all to well: I am a slow learner, but I learn.

This one can't put his fingers into any of my business anymore. We made sure of it. We, that is me and MY family, the Stark Family from Winterfell.

Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe. Leave four of them alive and you will soon be dead, unless you are on our side.

Sleep well, Lionqueen. I already sent for my faceless men to come and kill you.

Your little dove who is a white raven now

Sansa

The Night King was actually Brandon (the Builder) Stark. As commander of the Night's Watch, he built the Wall to protect the civilized kingdoms of Westeros against the Land of Always Winter. And, being a Stark, he had greensight of course (just like the Night King in the show).

He was believed to be the prophesied Azor Ahai in the time of the war between the First Men and the Andals, and this greatly affected his ego. So he drove his sword into his wife Neesa Neesa's chest to turn it into the Lightbringer and fulfill his prophecy, but nothing happened. He immediately regretted what he did and went south to the Isle of Faces to ask the Children of the Forest for help in resurrecting his dead wife, whose body he left partially buried in the forest just beyond the Wall.

Upon reaching the Isle of Faces, the COF believed he was just another one of the no-good First Men who wanted to bring war and domination to their homeland. They drove an obsidian dagger through his heart to make him into a White Walker, hoping he would create an army with his wife that would eliminate the First Men and the Andals alike and restore peace and serenity to their land.

Now as the Night King, Bran the Builder knew he would be deemed an abomination by civilization, so he could not return to Winterfell alone - his brother, the king, would not recognize him and would have him killed on the spot.

The Night King made it past the Wall and checked his wife's burial spot, but her partial grave had been disturbed and her body gone.

He began a slow trek north, becoming accustomed to the Land of Always Winter and also to his new White Walker body. Eventually, he came across a beautiful woman in the forest who looked just like him, and he discovered it was actually his wife.

They knew that Westerosi kingdoms would not allow them past the Wall, for they would fear that they were some type of monsters. But their goal was to get back to the Isle of Faces and force the COF to turn them back into humans. Together, they abducted wildling babies and wildling adults alike and turned them into White Walkers. They built this army in case they were met with resistance on their way to the Isle of Faces.

Then began the Long Night - the Night King, Night Queen and White Walker army marched south to the Wall and pushed into Westeros. There was a massive war between Northerners and White Walkers, and it resulted in the Night Queen (Neesa Neesa) being captured. She was brought to the deepest crypts of Winterfell that - ironically - the Night King himself had built (apparently there are crypts under Winterfell that are off-limits... the Starks probably don't even know why anymore, since it's been so long since they were last opened). The White Walker army was too small and had taken too many casualties, so they had to fall back to the Land of Always Winter.

Fast-forward to the present, and the Night King has amassed a much bigger army. When he connected with Bran (Three-Eyed Raven), he realized that he was a Stark, which angered him greatly. He also knows that Jon Snow is a Stark, and that is why he has a rivalry with him in the show. The Night King holds a grudge against the Stark house because to this day, they hold his wife captive in their crypts.

SO, the Night King is marching on civilized Westeros to obtain his wife from Winterfell and march his army south to the Isle of Faces to be turned human again. After centuries (or millenia?) of exile and longing for his wife to be at his side again, he no longer sees casualties as being 'bad' per se. He rather sees everybody as a potential White Walker convert to add to his army. And it's not because he wants dominance - instead, he has become obsessed with amassing as many soldiers as possible so he can rescue his wife and make it to the Isle of Faces and be turned human again.

The Night Queen is trapped under Winterfell and no one except the Night King knows it, so that's why he's headed there. And then they'll be on their way to the Isle of Faces to turn human again. So it's one big misunderstanding that Jon, Dany and all of Westeros think that the White Walkers just want to take over the continent.

Perhaps the White Walker/undead army, including the Night King and Queen, will even help Jon and Dany overthrow Cersei at King's Landing once they have been turned - providing them with a lot of extra help.

In many ways it's reaching but who knows.         

Most of this is supported with info from the show, but we do know that DD are following George's vision to a certain degree, so I think it's fair that I use some of the Text as evidence.         

I wonder if Melissandre is going to grow Jaime's hand back. It sounds stupid but if she can bring and entire person back to life why not. There are several things hinting at this.             

1. Jaime and Bronn training he says ""if I had my right Hand"" Bronn replies ""Plan on growing it back?""             

2. In Storm of Swords after the bath conversation Qyburn tells the guards to bring potions for the pain. Jaime says ""Bring me the potion that gorws new hands,"". There are a ton of references to ""growing it back"" which could just be his wishfull thinking and me reading too much into it, but this is GRRM.               

3. Arthur Dayne was Jaime's roll model. In the show he is shown using 2 swords to great effect, the text he only uses one but it does mention he is ambidextrous. Jaime has become decent with his left, if he were to get his right back chances are he could mimic Dayne's technique.           

4. Qyburn's obsession with the Wight's hand. This could just be Qyburn showing his fascination, but we know Qyburn is Jaime's Designated caretaker, we know he like to try unethical experiments, we know he brought the mountain back to life, and here he is intrigued by a severed but still functional hand. If not Mellisandre could Qyburn have been wondering ""that idea I had to grow Jaime's limb back might be possible.""           

4. The Knightkingslayer theory (jaime will kill the NK) and the Azor Ahai theory are both popular right now. This would require Jaime to be much better than he is with his left. Especially in the books where he is almost useless with it.                        

5. Beric has had damn near everything restored by the ""lord of light"". If Azor Ahai is really condoned by the lord of light, It's not a stretch to think he would restore Jaime's Hand.",29,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

But alas...

What if the Night king is a warg, just like Bran. 

It is clear that there are alot more wights than white walkers... And what if there is a reason. 

The night king only makes a white walker if the person was also a warg. And then in turn they warg into the wights.

Essentially the nihht king is controlling the whole army through several white walkers.

This theory could then play in to how the show will end.

Little dove,

I am happy for you that you made it to your old home safely.

I always cared for you like a mother, you know that. Much better than the Tully bitch who bred you into this world like the scared little beast that she was. Nothing a Lion thinks about twice before he devours it.

They told me the Frey rats cut her worthless throat and sent our regards faithfully. Cheers, Walder.

All thanks be to the Old and the New Gods, someone took care of this rat and his breed afterwards, too. Cheers.

I would love to meet that one personally and thank him for his duty. The world is a better place without all these little shits.

You are right, Sansa. You learnt it all from me, while your bitch of a mother is... what? Dead? Oh, yes, I think that's the correct word we use to describe useless human beings.

Your mother taught you nothing in life and she is now not more dead than she was before.

I am your mother and I have always been your mother, since the day we met. Accept my mercy. The Mother bestowed it on me. And I always loved you. Like Marcella. And they took her away from me. Like you.

Sansa, my sweet little dove. There is not one day I spend without thinking about having you back with me. I would keep you in a very safe place forever where no one would ever hurt you again.

I would find you friends that are stronger than Sir Gregor, who would kill every single one who would try to come and get at you.

Come back, my sweet girl, come back into your mother's womb.

You are mine.

Cersei

The perspective of Sam, nearly dead and wanting to die, dragging himself through the snow and remembering the events that brought home to this point, was completely engrossing. I was seriously impressed by the technique of illustrating the attack through multiple written (but mostly unsent) letters. It built up tension in the reader, we didn't know what was going to happen next and could feel Sam's fear.

This could be the succession system in Westeros, with the Small Council and Lords of the Seven Kingdoms casting votes.

Speculation: Dany will end up as Queen, naming Jon (Aegon) her successor. She also commands the Dothraki and Unsullied to follow Jon as their chief commander of armies. When she dies, Jon is elected King by her Council. Jon also inherits Rhaegal. (Drogon and undead Viserion fight each other to death)

He names Tyrion his hand, Sansa Lady of Winterfell and Warden of the North, and Brienne as Commander of the Kingsguard. Varys would stay on the Small Council. 

Think about how this fits. Tyrion is one of the most intelligent minds in Westeros, fit to be the Hand to Dany. Sansa is the oldest remaining Stark, and already has the role of Lady of Winterfell. Brienne has always wanted to protect a worthy and rightful King/Lord/Lady. (Renly, Catelyn, Sansa) ",36,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

After watching the last episode I can safely say that this my favorite show. Everything from the music to the characters (and oh my are there a lot of them). I have never seen a show with so many twists and turns, I was constantly on edge and always kept hitting the next episode button. Its been a day since I finished and its all I can think about.

Martin,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8f65x2/no_spoilers_an_analysis_of_the_spiritual_state/,Sumpp,1524776707,"He was the lonely kid, who has felt missing out on something for his entire life. He missed out on being the popular kid with a lot of friends, the kid who was liked by many and who received a lot of attention and acceptance, shortly put the kid that was loved.

But when you become rich and famous, you become the popular kid. Suddenly you are on the top of the world. Everyone knows you and some even worship you. Your life gets super intense and now you have so much money and connections that everything is possible. You dare to dream again. You feel young again. You are tasting the golden youth that was lost. And it is intoxicating. When you feel young, death becomes something irrelevant and distant to you.

Martin is in denial of his mortality. The real reason he has started working on multiple side projects instead of finishing A Song of Ice and Fire is to keep himself distracted from the inevitability of his death, the fact that he is an old man and might not finish his great work. In other words, he is pretending to himself that he has all the time in the world. He will have time to finish all those book series so there is no rush. When the entire world is waiting for you to do something, by procrastinating you are bargaining with death. He is saying to God \(or destiny, or the world or whatever is the equivalent in his subconscious belief system\): You dont dare to kill me yet, everyone wants me to live a little bit longer, the best is yet to come.

He might say; Oops, I accidentally wrote so much extra material that we have to split this extra book into two parts and even think that himself but that would be part of his subconscious plan to keep him further distracted and more incomplete. By procrastinating the final book of the main series, the great completion that he subconsciously knows would fulfil his ultimate purpose, he is prolonging his own life so he can build an empire before death dares to kill him. By starting multiple side projects he is deceiving himself with promises based on a lie I will not die. Valar morghulis.

Martin sold his soul to fame and fortune, which is probably what most of us would have done in his place. He chose money and the fantasy of immortality over purpose and being the good guy. Fans who say: George doesnt owe us anything, he can do whatever he wants, we have no right to complain are in denial of their self\-worth, because they are worshiping him as their idol \(which is exactly what Georges ego, being very powerful at this point, wants.\) Celebrities and great artists often suffer from a more powerful ego than an average person, and building an empire and denying death is what an ego wants. The extra books will also sell better now when the show is still running and globally a hot topic. The main books will sell anyway years after.

An artist who is not on an ego trip doesnt feel like being above his/her fans and acknowledges the suffering he/she puts his/her fans through by promising them something sweet at the beginning and making them wait for more. Think about it: if you were writing a series of books for someone you cared about, for their enjoyment \(and for your own enjoyment through their enjoyment\) and they loved your books and craved for more, would you hurry up writing more? Please note that by hurrying up I dont necessarily mean sacrificing quality, only sacrificing fantasies of perfection \(which is way more than your reader would ever require from you to be fulfilled\). By hurrying up I dont mean writing as fast as possible, but taking the craving of your reader into consideration. By hurrying up you are thinking this is good enough for my readers enjoyment, not this is perfect for me. Many great artists started as good guys who got enjoyment from the enjoyment of others, but as they got some fame and fortune, their ego transformed the good guy to the great artist who desires perfection to lift his/her self\-image.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm halfway through book 4 and one of the big disparities I have noticed (among several) is the Kingslayer's fighting skill. The show mentions that he was really good before the maiming, but they don't really emphasize it that much.           

I've been surprised reading ASOIAF that he's among the best in the entire world at the time. People compare other fighters to him and even his name makes people shake in their boots. The battle's and tournaments his won are constantly menionted and he is praised even by people who despise his guts (Ned, Barristan, Robbert, Victarion). Fans of the show only (my former self included) have the Idea that Syrio, Oberyn, Jon, Ned, and Drogo are the best and that Jaime isn't that high up. That's understandable given the show doesn't emphasize his skill much but going by the Novel he's league's beyond those mentioned.  The uncontested best melee fighter in the known world, with Barristan and the clegane's being the only close contenders.             

I personally prefer it this way, it gives his character more of a reason to be the ass that he is, and makes his hand loss that much more impactful. Season 7 Euron did call him ""the best in the world"" but that's the first time he has even been mentioned in that light. Have the show creators or actors mentioned anything about why this change was made? Was it due to a lack of screen time or did they intend to change his character? Did they want him to be more sympathetic or more defined by his sister fucking than his skill? ",25,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

While I really respect that, because it shows that the showrunners actually care about the source material, I really wish that HBO would have had a little more care. Now obviously, I'm not part of HBO and have no idea what happened leading up to that. But I decided to take a look at IMDB, and this is what they had at that point:

- DB Weiss - 

 * Absolutely nothing. He had no directing credit, no writing credit, and the only producing credit that he had was for five episodes of a TV show called The Specials.

- David Benioff:

 * Writing credits:
   * Troy

   * Stay
 
   * The Kite Runner

   * X-Men Origins: Wolverine (yep, for reals)

   * Brothers

Benioff at least has a little credit to his name. While he did write X-Men Origins, he did also write the screenplay for Troy (which wasn't awful from a writing standpoint), as well as 25th hour, The Kite Runner, and Brothers. I haven't seen any of those, but they all seem to have at least above average reviews. But you take a look at that and just have to wonder ""why"". 

I'm sure that everyone involved had no idea that Game of Thrones would explode into the juggernaut that it is today, but they had to believe that it would at least be somewhat successful. And if that's the case, why would they hand the entire thing over to one guy with no experience at all, and another with only three or four movies? 

I'd like to believe that they had some sort of proof of writing talent. In all fairness, 25th hour is apparently based off of a book of the same name that Benioff himself actually wrote. And they've proven that they're not completely incompetent writers in terms of the show, because they wrote the ""Robert and Cersei baby conversation"" scene, as well as the ""Chaos is a ladder"" scene. Both of which did not take place in the books, so D&amp;D wrote those from scratch. But it makes so much more sense now why a lot of their ""original"" dialogue from S5 onward is so terrible. 

I know that this post is a little disjointed, I'm just kind of brain dumping here. D&amp;D aren't all bad, they did some amazing adaption work from the books. But at the same time, it just makes you sit and wonder how two dudes were given this entire thing in their laps when they barely had any experience between the two of them.",9,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Who do you believe is the identity of the Night King? Personally I believe he is one of three people:

- Proto-Stark: as in he is some sort of descendent of House Stark.

- Proto-Stargaryen/the first child of ice and fire: so this is a theory I have and that is the Night King is the first child of ice and fire long before Jon and that a Targ came to westeros before Aegon and made love with a Decendent of House Stark, it would explain how the Night King is able to control the ice dragon this season.

- The Night's King of legend/13th Lord Commander: this theory is alittle crazy but this is sort of a counter theory I have to my Proto-Stargaryen theory, basically the person in the cave drawings and in the flashback from S6 is NOT the Night King we see in the show, the person from the cave drawings and whom we saw get turned was Bael the Bard and the Night King we see is his son and also the Night's King of legend/the 13th Lord commander with the legends about him being build on lies.

For the last 47 years peace has been apparent throughout the continent, ever since the peace treaty was signed by the would be king, Robb Stark King in the North and the Southern King, King Tommen Baratheon. Robb would take the young Baratheon girl Mrycella to be his bride, Tommen would take the Northern princess Sansa in exchange for peace between the two kingdoms. House Lannister was defeated with exception to Tyrion Lannister who was allowed to keep his life as also part of the peace treaty. The grandchildren of these noble kings and lords now live in fear of the would be conquerer Rhaego II Targaryen.

I think the ""love, true love"" is what makes the story of AA/NN  works (not just a hero and his wife). If so it is Jorah who has a true love for Daenerys. Jon and Danny relationship is not deep enough. 

What if Jorah has to create lightbringer? Literally, jorah is the one who ""came back' (not from death). 3 times.",2,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also, Arya was very injured, even after Lady Crane tried to heal her. When she fell in the stairs, she started to bleed again and struggled to walk. But after bringing the Waif's face back, she continued to walk normally with her badasstitude.

WHAT IF the Waif killed Arya in the cave and took her face. She knew everything about her by playing the game of faces. She knew her list. Jaqen told her ""you are finally no one."" And by saying ""a girl is Arya Stark, and I'm going home"" she could just play her.

I don't know how many times i watched the first appearance of Lyanna Mormont in the Show. I was always wondering why Lyanna called Davos ""Ser"" in this Scene. Bear Island is in the very North of Westeros. On the contrary Ser is title which is given to Knights who believe in the faith of the seven which is only common in the south. Davos travelled with Sansa and Jon who both shouldn't have any southern friends.

It just doesn't makes sense Lyanna assuming of Davos to be from the south. If she said it of courtesy ""Lord"" would have fit more in this Scene than ""Ser"" because nothern men believe more likely in the old gods. She couldn't have know that Davos is from the South.",24,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Mine comes from the books. Speton Meribald gives an extremly powerful speech of how a soldier breaks in war, and in reality, he's actually talking about how he broke in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. After that speech, the reader starts to sympathize, albeit a little, for the men in the war who've turned rampant.

In the show for me it's Tyrion's speech in his trial. Dinklage dominates that scene so well.

I find this so interesting. GRRM did such a wonderful job creating this character because it seems
he simply wrote this character so that everyone could hate him. 

Theon Greyjoy.. a person who did not  belong to any family. His father never fought for him after he was captured .. and just wrote him off. His family
couldn't care less.. so sad.  The Starks.. always reminded him he didn't belong. That he was a prisoner, in fact everyone reminded him of that. Like it was his choice. So sad.
And unfortunately, the one time he had a chance to regain his family back, he made the wrong choice. Peer pressure at its finest. So sad. What a horrible situation to be in.
Then to be taken prisoner and tortured with no pity from anyone. I mean his sister did try, but he had already given up hope. A poor unfortunate soul.
Seems like life is teaching him that he is meant for nothing but to be of service to others.
Yes Theon isn't the best person in the world because life handed him a cruel hand. 

So I guess that is where I am confused. How is it easy to hate someone like this after seeing life through his eyes?  Does anyone pity Theon?
I find myself wanting to give him pity because it seems no one has pity for him. Perhaps this is what GRRM intended to do when creating this character. Idk. Its just fantastic how he did it.

(Also, if you do hate him, thats understandable and GRRM did a great job creating a character that served this purpose.)

 Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen. She fits the role somewhat and that's the only reason her terrible acting skills aren't fully showcased (like in everything else she's done). But she's still pretty dull and monotone.


 Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon. He isn't a bad actor, but I just couldn't buy him as the once mighty and handsome warrior and conqueror who got lazy and obese over the years. The guy looks like he was born fat. Plus, the performance was too sitcom-ish. No wonder he became a meme. A MEEEME, NED!


 Whatever her name was as Shae. God, listening her talk was painful. I actually wonder if that running joke about how she got cast is true.
