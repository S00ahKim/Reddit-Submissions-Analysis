During the scene where they stumble upon the stag and dire wolf that killed one another, it's clear that it's a big foreshadow for what is to come later on with the downfall of house Stark and Baratheon. But now, with the knowledge of who the three-eyed raven is and what he can do, wouldn't it be obvious that he controlled the two animals and set them there to be discovered? Both as a warning and as a gift to the Starks who were greatly aided by their wolves? I'm sure GRRM could have just written in as symbolism, but it could easily be that. Idk, thoughts?

GoT is the masterpiece it is because it teats the audience like mature adults and doesn't appeal to traditional black and white story telling,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5wwid5/everything_just_finished_watching_the_full_series/,CheloniaMydas,1488381790,"The show does a phenomenal job at crafting a wonderful story and it does it whilst at all times treating the audience like mature adults. It didn't shy away from sex, gratuitous violence and harsh language. Where in other shows/movies an over use of these things can come across as cheap or cheesy here it did not because it had a very strong well written story running through the core and holding it all together with context and well written characters. 

Characters that die at a moments notice. Nearly every time a key character dies I was caught off guard. So many years of watching TV have made me accustomed to seeing the main characters survive to fight another day and left knowing the ""good guy"" always wins had left me naively unexpectant. GoT completely it seems forgot this pillar of traditional TV stories and decides that churning through cast members is the way to go. **The Red Wedding** being but one example and I am sure I'm not the only one to be left completely speechless by the end.

Never before has a series played with my emotions so much. Characters I started disliking I grew to love and characters I initially liked I grew to dislike. This is the key to good believable characters, they show progression and an ability to sway your emotions towards them. To often characters are statically the ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" but here that notion is not always an apt description. 

Jamie Lannister being a shinning example of someone who motives and story ranges on both ends of that spectrum. Tyrion a character I found I cared little for initially by the end of season 6 is my favorite character. My favorite scene of the whole series so far might just be the scene towards the end of S6E10 when Tyrion is made Hand of the Queen. The emotion in that scene where he is finally recognized and gets deserved recognition for his contributions that he has yearned all his life for had me with a lump in my throat. It was  title given to him not because of his name or because his family felt obligated to give him a token position but because he deserved it.

This is why the series is so damn amazing, looking back on season 1 and now looking at the end of season 6 seeing the full journey some of these characters have made is an incredible testament to character development. Development that has been nurtured for 6 seasons, stories that at first appeared separate individual chapters that are now becoming intertwined into one final plot piece

A boy is pleased but mournful of the wait for season 7",53,371,False,self,,,,,

They may have talked a good talk, but as of the end of Season 6, they make the Starks look like strategic prodigies.  At the very least - they seemed to not understand the one simple fundamental concept that Cersei knew right from the beginning of Season 1 - When you play the game of Thrones, you win or you die - there is NO middle ground.  


One failed marriage-alliance after another; Margaery just could not seem to keep a solid marriage in tact for very long. And if Olenna hadn't poisoned Joffrey, they would likely have at least been able to keep the Tyrell family lineage alive.


Olenna got completely owned by Tywin when her plans were snuffed out with one simple threat of naming Loras - the only heir to Highgarden, to the Kingsguard.


Loras got owned when Cersei decides to use him as bait to eventually get Margaery locked up.


Margaery got owned when Cersei predicted she would lie to protect her brother. She also pissed Cersei off in numerous occasions by calling her ""Sister"" or ""Mother"" in a teasing manner, which certainly didn't endear her to Cersei.  Plus all that subtle compliance with the High Sparrow and pretending to be newly devout in order to team up to take on the Lannisters just seemed like terrible planning on Margery's part.


Olenna got owned again when she tried to threaten Cersei into releasing Loras by cutting off the grain and gold (which it appears she NEVER did throughout Season 5 and Season 6 despite both Loras and Margery being locked up for months), and Cersei flat-out no-sold her threat with a simple ""House Lannister has no rivals"", and a threat of her own - ""do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?"". Obviously she's cut them off now since Cersei murdered her entire family, but during the time Margaery and Loras were alive and locked up, it didn't seem like Olenna actually did anything to back up her smack talk.


And all of them got owned in the end when Cersei decided she's had enough of being pushed into a corner, and decided to wipe the board clean.


So which misstep was House Tyrell's BIGGEST? What would you say was the main thing that caused their huge downfall?",35,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I think a clear problem that I hope is show in the next season is the problems that go along with having such a large force. Most folk have from other threads talked about the supplying problem but i wish to address a problem that i feel is being overlooked. 

Her army is made up of many different people,religions and cultures which will lead to many problems due to infighting and different agendas. She has ironborn who worship the drowned god and have a culture based on raiding and naval actions. They dislike authority figures who have not earned the right to lead them and likely get into fights with anyone who is not them giving orders.

Next you have the Dothraki who are normal a nomadic people who worship the great stallion and like the Ironborn have a culture of raiding and raping along with tradition of cavalry fighting. Again like the Ironborn they follow leaders who have earned the right either by being the best fighter or the person who killed there last warlord. They are very undisciplined with a tendency to in fighting.  

Next you have the Unsullied who worship no gods and are simple elite Infantry made up of slave soldiers. Highly trained and will follow orders to the letter and die on command. They will not give daenerys any problems but there are a limit amount of them and no one to replace them if they die.

Next you have the armys of Dorne and the Reach who respectfully follow the seven or Mother Rhoyne as there religions. Both are cultures based on feudal system with the Reach based on farming and Dorne based on trading and fruit. Both have professional army's with ranking structures and discipline and have worked togather in past wars.


So its a big army with many races,religion and cultures. The unsullied,Reach, and Dorne will likely not be a problem as they are trained soldiers with organization. But a problem they may have is they have there own leaders who want revenge at any cost and may get testy with Daenerys if she appears slow or weak in the case of Dorne and the Reach. The Unsullied will do as there told and be loyal to Dany but she has a a unknow amount of them left after her conquests in slavers bay and she has no one to replace them if they die. They will likely be used as a last resort and as her Body Guard unit. 

Her biggest problems will be with the IronBorn and the Dothraki. Both are know for there indiscipline and betraying if the odds are not in there favor. They are fierce warriors no doubt but they have limited skilled. The Ironborn are only know to be good with naval Actions and the Dothraki for there Calvary. They likely will be picking fights with each other and them self's and will be insubordinate if anyone but there own gives them orders. Plus dany has to win the small folk which is not going to happen if they are raiding and raping They greyjoys have given there word that Ironborn will not do that but I doubt they will be able to control all there men meanwhile we dont even know if the Dothraki have given the same promise.

They best thing she can do is keep the Ironborn in the water with independent command to blockade ports and help with the conquest of kings landing and for the Dothraki to be used as cannon fodder at every opportunity. Storming a breach in a Castle send the Dothraki in on foot to clear the way. Got a battle against a heavy infantry army send the Dothraki  against them. Final battle against the white walkers send the Dothraki in. My point being thin there numbers out my reasoning for this is they are a wild nomadic warrior culture who will only cause problems in the long run for dany. Can you imagine what the Dothraki  will do after the war do you think they will abandon there raiding and raping to pick up farming or trading or religion unlikely. No the best thing to do is thin there numbers out to the point were they will not be a threat to peace and wil bred with other people and lose there culture in few generations or get every last one of them killed in battle which to all Dothraki is a honor.

So what do you guys think do you think everything will work out prefectly for daenerys or will there be problems ?  P.s sorry if my grammar and spelling is off english is not my first language.",31,10,False,self,,,,,

We see Robert as King and Protector of the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Baratheon of House Baratheon dragging the Hound and the seven King's Guards around. Otherwise, besides the City Watch, the only armed people we see are Lannister Soldiers. The same shows up in Robert's ""progress"" (trip) to Winterfell. Now is this supposed be one way we see how Robert is too drunk and to sunken in debauchery to recognize his situation, where most of the people with swords around him are pledged to House Lannister?

In a real feudal society, Robert as King has his own household and retainers. They would come from two sources, the Crown Lands, whose knights, bannermen and men-at-arms hold their lands from his hands as King and the Storm Lands, where the lesser Houses, knights, bannermen and men-at-arms hold their lands from him as Lord of his House. At the minimum, in exchange for these lands, the holders owed 30 days a year of guard service at one of the King's or Lord's castles, forts and fortresses and in attendance on him. Certainly the Red Keep is not the only strategic point to garrison considering both Storm's End and Dragonstone, but Robert as liege lord would have had a significant force in his own right in and around King's Landing. At a minimum, this would have been 500 heavy armored cavalry (knights/bannermen), 1,000 medium armored cavalry (squires/mounted men-at-arms), 500 light cavalry (wealthy commoners/poor nobles), 500 heavy infantry (dismounted men-at-arms), 1,000 medium armored infantry (wealthy commoners/poor nobles) and around 6,000 light infantry, spearmen and bowmen (crossbows or longbows, poor free commoners). The heavy cavalry would perform mounted and dismounted guard duty in the perimeter just outside the King's Guard and the Hound. Some of course would guard the children and the wife, who might be allowed a small guard of Lannister troops. 

No real King would allow a subordinate Lord to build a standing army within his kingdom, such as those the wealthy Houses of Lannister and Tyrell have evidently created. No levies, no retainers of any level of wealth would show such uniformity of clothing, armor and arms. These must be Soldiers on full time duty for pay. Not mercenaries, as note how disparate the arms, armor and clothing of the Second Sons looks. And it would seem that there are thousands on the payroll for both Houses. Is this another sign that Robert is a weak King sunken in debauchery and needing to be replaced?

Finally, how could any King or man of any intelligence have not questioned, even in his own mind, the paternity of his children. Robert had a multitude of bastards (all of which he knew about but did not acknowledge) that looked like him, even when their mothers were as blond and blue eyed as Cersei. Was he so sunken in debauchery that he didn't notice or was it that he was sunken in debauchery BECAUSE he knew his heirs were not his?",18,0,False,self,,,,,

At the same time, I've watched movies without reading the books first, loved them, then had the book fans tell me the movies are awful. So I'm wondering what someone who only watches the show thinks of these moments for a different perspective. Do you like the scenes? Is there anything you'd change about them? If so, what?
I don't think these will be in chronological order:

1. Arya/Waif chase scene
2. Arya's Faceless Men training overall 
3. Dany being rescued by Drogon in the fighting pits
4. Jaime and Tyrion parting ways
5. The Sand Snakes killing the royal family in Dorne
6. The kingsmoot on the Iron Islands
7. Bran meeting the 3 eyed crow
8. Dany in the House of the Undying
9. The Umbers siding with the Boltons for the Battle of the Bastards
10. The way Greywind and Summer died pitifully 
11. Jon beheading Janos Slynt
12. Barristan's death where he and Grey Worm fought weakly
13. Little Finger killing Lysa Arryn
14. Loras and Renly's scenes together
Adding because I forgot:
15. Dany burning the khals

I'd also love to hear opinions of characters who were characterized differently in the books. Do you like them? What do you consider their defining traits?:
1. The Mountain
2. Euron Greyjoy
3. Tyrion
4. Jaime
5. Ellaria Sand
6. Doran Martell
7. The Blackfish
8. Mance
9. Jorah
10. Daario
11. LORAS (can't begin to express my rage)
12. Renly
13. ""Yara"" Greyjoy
14. All the Sand Snakes
15. Brienne
16. Cersei
17. And of course, Jon Snow

Whew, you really realize how many characters are in the books when you list 17 with major book-show changes and it's a tiny percentage of them. ",42,8,False,self,,,,,

Firstly, when Daenerys goes into the House of the Undying and has visions of a destroyed Red Keep. It looks like snow covers the ground, but this could well be ash from her dragons and the destroyed keep could be the aftermath of a battle for King's Landing, possibly.

Next, related to the first point, Tyrion says something which I believe to be quite significant to Cersei when she captures Ros believing her to be a whore that Tyrion has become especially friendly with. Well, he says ""your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" Now, Cersei is on the throne with all her children dead. Surely she can't be happy about this, but all she really cares about is power at this point. This quotation could be foreshadowing the eventual fate of King's Landing following the arrival of Dany and her dragons...

Lastly, of course, there's the prophecy made by Maggy where she says ""Queen you shall be until there comes another, younger, and more beautiful."" Now this passage could well mean Daenerys, pointing to an almost-certain take-over of King's Landing by the Mother of Dragons given that all her other prophecies have come true in Cersei's case (except the valonqar one which was omitted in the show).

What do you guys think? I think that these scenes are pretty evident fore-shadowing of Daenerys's take over in Westeros which, of course, most people think is going to happen anyway :)",42,39,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon is trying to call Ghost back to them but he just kinda goes off to explore. Qhorin is kinda telling Jon thats its pointless for Jon to try to tame a wild animal




.

&gt;""There goes your pet"" -Qhorin

&gt;""He's not a pet"" -Jon

&gt;""You're right he's not. You can't tame a wild thing, you can trust a wild thing""

&gt;""Ghost is different""

&gt;""So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. **And you'll never know them**""




.


I wonder if this is foreshadowing for Jons wolf dreams that are in the book. God the show is incredible in its own right but theres just things i wish they included that made the books so great.

to be noted, Qhorin then switches the subject to the Wildlings way of life, to which Jon refers to Quorin talking about how you can't know wild things, and then Qhorin replies to Jon, ""I said you can't""

Thats obviously referring to the mission he gives Jon later to become one a wildling and infiltrate their ranks etc.

everything spoiler tag cause i give away that Jons warging abilities are never referenced to date in the show.

This is at least the second time through cycle of time.  The three eyed raven tells Bran, you must become me, because the three eyed raven is Bran from last time through the cycle of time.

  In the previous iteration of the cycle of time, before the events the events we see in Game of Thrones happened, the White Walkers made it all of the way down to Kings landing.  Humanity triumphs over the White Walkers in the battle.  Humanity has won but they did not know to burn all of the bodies.  The dead rise and humanity is all but lost.  

  I the nick of time, Bran goes back in time to attempt to rectify this error.  He goes to good king Aerys II Targaryen, to warn the king that he needs to burn them all.  We have seen this other places in the show.  When Bran goes back in time to warn Hodor to hold the door.  Unfortunately this does not go as planned and the good king goes mad, like Hodor did.

  Bran was the one who broke King Aerys Targaryens mind, making him go from a good king to a mad king.  Many people spoke of how Aerys had been a good king, until he went mad.  There were many accounts of, after the king went mad, he just kept repeating, Burn them all.  He, like Hodor just kept repeating the instructions that had been put into his mind by Bran.  

  The first time through the timeline, all of the great families of Game of Thrones were united under King Aerys.  All of the events and drama we see in the show, was caused by the change Bran made to King Aerys Targaryens mind.  It causes the king to burn the elder Stark, setting off Roberts Rebellion.

The one that really did my mom in was in S1E7 with Ros and the other prostitute having oral sex and then simulating male/female sex while Baelish is talking to them. That scene was several minutes long and made my whole family uncomfortable ... the sex scenes before those weren't as long and were either important to the story (e.g., S1E1) or just a few seconds long.

My mom is really into the story and I'm actually surprised how much she has guessed correctly. I would really like her to continue it so she can see how much she got right. She agreed, but only if we fast forward those scenes.

I honestly can't remember scenes as graphic/long as that one to be honest. It's been so long and I'm being reminded how much sex there is after introducing the show to my rents and it's a tad awkward lol.

Question the first.  The black clothing and deserters.  Couldn't a deserter of the watch just claim to be a normal person who happens to be wearing black if they are caught?  Like how would anyone know they were watch members and not just a sell sword or something?  When someone runs away from the watch do ravens get sent to the northern houses telling them and giving a description so they can be on the lookout?  

Second question.  Is there only 1 Lord Commander of all the nights watch or does each castle have their own Lord Commander?  When the election happened there were people from the two other NW castles who put up candidates so it would seem like there is 1 Lord Commander of all the NW but then like does each other watch castle have like a Second in Commander who runs that castle but still answers to the Lord Commander at Castle Black?

Questions three.  Is Castle Black like the ""headquarters"" castle of all the NW or is it just the easiest one to get to because it is closest to the kings road?   It seemed like people who were stewards when Jon first took his vows were sent to the other two castles and Janos Slynt was sent to eastwatch when he was sent to join the watch but then had to go to Castle Black.  So assuming there is 1 LC of the entire watch then does like every new recruit get sent to Castle Black for training and then some get sent back to the shadow tower or eastwatch?",12,7,False,self,,,,,

From Dorne, we get decent summer wine and poison (though, given the amount of sand in Dorne, I'm sure glass is a huge industry).

When one turns a spyglass towards Braavos, however, one can see cultural and financial assets that affect Westeros in major ways:

* The Iron Bank of Braavos

* The House of Black and White

* ~~hatred of slavery~~ (might've softballed that one in, sorry)

* Water Dance sword fighting, I guess

I believe this comes not only from being one the biggest Free Cities of Essos, but from the fact that Braavos was never a part of the [Valyrian Freehold](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_Freehold), and never suffered from the Doom of Valyria (unless you count the Sealord of Braavos sending hundred warships to help Lys).

'I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell,' she says.

This comes, of course, shortly after Melisandre abandons Stannis to his inevitable doom, the desertion of half of what remains of his army convincing her that he is not destined to oust the Boltons from Winterfell and fulfill the Azor Ahai prophecy after all.

Shortly before she parts ways with Stannis, Melisandre reassures him of her confidence that he will prevail, having apparently witnessed 'Bolton banners burning' while looking into the flames. 

The most obvious explanation here is that Melisandre simply jumped to conclusions when she had that vision. Just because the Boltons were destined to lose Winterfell doesn't necessarily mean that Stannis would be the one to defeat them. Melisandre had been championing Stannis as Azor Ahai for years by that point, so her 'wishful thinking' here, while tragically foolish, was understandable.

Though she remained convinced that Stannis was to play the role of Azor Ahai up until she learned of the mass desertions from his army, Melisandre took great interest in Jon Snow from the moment they first crossed paths, though what role(s) she imagined him playing in the prophecy at that point is unclear.

Both Stannis and Melisandre attempt to persuade Jon to leave the Night's Watch and join their campaign. Stannis's reasoning is pretty clear--he recognizes the political value of having a *de facto* Stark beside him as he attempts to convince various Northern houses to unite behind him against the Boltons.

Melisandre, on the other hand, is considerably less interested in Westerosi politics than is Stannis, rendering her interest in Jon more difficult to make sense of. Clearly, she saw him as an important figure going forward, all the while remaining (stubbornly?) convinced that Stannis would play the single most important role.

The main thing I wonder is, *'When did Melisandre first have this vision of Jon fighting at Winterfell?'* If she experienced this while Stannis was still alive--which seems more likely than not--shouldn't Jon's decision to remain in the Night's Watch and leave for Hardhome at the same time Stannis was leaving for Winterfell have raised a 'red flag' for her? Wouldn't she, knowing that Jon would not be traveling with them yet, suggest to Stannis that a key piece of her vision wasn't falling neatly into place, and question the timing of his march south? 

Perhaps ironically, it was Davos, not Melisandre, who suggested to Stannis that they should delay their march until Jon returned from Hardhome, albeit for the more 'worldly' concern of potentially adding more troops to their army once the Wildlings from Hardhome made it south of the Wall.

Because let's just think for a second last season that Red Priest said to Varys he heard a name in the flames. What if that Flame is Jon's real name Jahearys, or Areys, or Aegon, or Aemon, or Rhaegar the II or whatever you want to pick. Maybe Varys after he became master of whisperers (because i am aware he did hear that name in the flames before he whined to KL in case anyone was wondering) he decides to do research into this name he heard. He does not find anything but when he is a Tourney of Harrenhal he sends some of his little birds to spy on Rhaegar to make sure Rhaegar is doing his job and finding the knight of the laughing tree.

When they report back he finds out that they last saw Rhaegar found out the knight was Lyanna. Soon after awhile and hearing Rhaegar ""Kidnapped"" (notice how i use bunny ears when i say Kidnapped) Lyanna he then connected the dots and found out Lyanna willingly ran away with Rhaegar. He also later connected the dots and found out that and child was born in the tower of joy and that it was the child of Rhaegar and Lyanna and that the child was under the alias of Ned's bastard.....Jon Snow.

However Varys could not risk Robert finding out if he were to try and get the child to the free cities so he allowed Ned to take him in as his bastard and he wrote a Letter to Jon claiming he is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna but never gave to him and kept the letter to give to Jon as a Plan B just in case Dany failed or died he would bring Jon to be the new king. Either that or so he can make Dany look like the invading conqueror and Jon would come in as the shining hero and save KL from Dany (though i find the latter more likely).

So next Season when Jon goes to Dragonstone perhaps Varys will meet with Jon and reveal to him his true Parentage.

It is also fair to consider i considered maybe Varys had plans to also marry Jon to one of the stark sisters. But i decided not to because i did not want to get stormed with people saying that is gross (AryaxJon is gross though)  ",15,4,False,self,,,,,

Podrick claims to have tied them up securely. Brienne insists that if this were the case, they wouldn't have vanished. Podrick then proposes that it could have been thieves. The only thing wrong with this is that if it were thieves then would they not have killed Pod and Brienne in their sleep to be safe? Ever since the Hound jacked that pigs feet guy's cart before the Red Wedding, we've learnt that he is willing to steal from people if he needs to, yet Arya is willing to keep him from killing the victim. Coincidentally, these two parties were in close proximity at this time.

So I was basically wondering if it was the Hound and Arya who took the horses, or if we even find out what happened. Was it already established at a later or earlier point in the series that I just forgot about? What do you guys think?

A lot of people think she's going to shitstomp Cersei. Is she though? Let's take a look: 

We have Euron with the Iron Islands on his side. Now here's the thing about Euron: not only does he probably have some tricks up his sleeve that will totally counter-shitstomp Dany, but he also has a huge leg up on her. How? Well, Euron has a navy - Dany has a fleet. That's the biggest difference between the two. 

The Reach is probably in a state of civil war - remember, only Olenna and by extension whoever is heir of House Tyrell suspect what really happened in King's Landing. None of the other houses in the Reach have cause to rebel against their home country. 

Cersei definitely has the strength of the Westerlands on her side. The Stormlands are uncertain, but I believe that Cersei may have Qyburn track down Gendry, legitimize him as a Baratheon and get the Stormlands on her side. The Eyrie is unprotected, although the army of the Vale's majority is still here. Perhaps she will send Bronn to take it. 

That leaves the Riverlands, who were just freed of Frey control and likely have no desire whatsoever to participate in any conflict. 

So in the end, Dany has her three dragons, a fleet with no real force behind it, Unsullied, Dothraki, Dorne, and let's be kind and say half the Reach. We've yet to see how effective Dothraki would be against a trained, ready force of armored men, and the dragons are just too OP not to be nerfed by Euron Shenanigans. ",128,34,False,self,,,,,

As we saw in season 6, Bran Stark went back in time. Ned Stark even heard him during the Tower of Joy scene. After all that the Lannister's did to the Stark family, Bran Stark decided to go back in time and convince the Mad King to not lose the throne and destroy the city just to stop the Lannister conquest. This is why the Mad King went mad. He started hearing things. He started hearing things like ""Burn them all"", which was really the voice of Bran. Now, if you started hearing voices, you would be pretty freaked out, too. This made the Mad King lose all sanity that he had. Without Bran Stark, Jamie would have never killed the Mad King, the throne would be at in the hands of the Targaryens. Daenerys would have never married Khal Drogo. Ned Stark would not be killed because Joffrey would have never been in power. If it wasn't for Bran, it would never have been this way. This may seem a bit crazy. Thoughts?",22,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Namely, Arya's notion of it being possible for Thoros to resurrect her father is swiftly dismissed, understandably so as Ned has been dead for at least a year at that point and his remains, by then substantially decomposed, are nowhere near where they are, but for the sake of argument, let's imagine Thoros had somehow been present immediately after Ned was beheaded, and was not interrupted by anyone else there; would it indeed be possible for the Lord of Light to bring back a man without a head through his prayer? Consider the fact that Beric had suffered significant dismemberment, and these massive injuries mostly healed upon his resurrection(s), so it raises the question on what the precise limits to that are.

Likewise, given Thoros' insistence that his ability to resurrect Beric (let alone six-plus times) is dependent on the Lord of Light willing it, how rare do you think it is for someone to be held as eligible for resurrection and/or its activation, especially multiple times? Consider the seemingly less-than-super-special circumstances under which it is allowed for Beric and Thoros (since the former is not a very major character and doesn't seem poised for any sort of crucial destiny, especially since we know his role from the books is over, and the latter is hardly the most devout of priests).

This being a series so infamous for permanently killing off major characters, it just seems very weird that a relatively minor character, and him alone, has been resurrected repeatedly, but without it being clarified what makes him so uniquely eligible for this and why others aren't (such as by having others try and fail to replicate the method that brings him back). GRRM has said he meant Beric's character to represent a sort of deconstruction of stories (mainly long-running comics franchises) where characters are constantly resurrected in perfect shape, since he sustains lasting disfigurement and memory loss, and I can respect that intention, but it, again, still raises major lore questions for the otherwise-realistic-with-death setting as a whole.",7,13,False,self,,,,,

Looking back, it was probably one of the first times we see Jon realize that enemies (of sorts) can become friends. Before meeting him, Jon ""knew"" that Lannisters were all bad people. Couldn't be trusted and were generally unpleasant. Yet by episode 3 we see Jon's opinion entirely change. He's actually sad to see him go. It's nice to notice that even early on they hinted at the overall character of Jon. Not always the smartest but always willing to make friends. Of course we also see it with Grenn and Pyp. 

But I'm curious to see a reunion between the two. Do you think they'll have an interesting conversation in season 7?

No, I'll happily pin that on rushed writing.
What I mean is the entirety of the Faceless Men plot. She's supposed to be No One, and thinks that's what her goal is...but ends up realizing that she can't be No One, that she's Arya Stark.
Sexy Jesus puts her through some training. Harsh training, but he's obviously the god's drill sergeant so it's clear he's not being malicious. Then, when she meets that other Faceless Gal, she's taking a sick pleasure in kicking Arya to the ground for several episodes. Why was she allowed to be Someone, in a sense? ""No One"" wouldn't harbor such hate and take delight in beating up a fellow Faceless, would they? I'd expect indifference, not this homicidal high school bully type of behavior.

Then, Faceless Gal stabs Arya as an old lady. Arya heals up. Faceless Gal shows up, murders her caretaker, then goes on a weird Terminator style rampage through the city, knocking over people, jumping ledges, spilling cabbages...basically, a LOT of collateral damage JUST to get to Arya. Faceless Men are known for taking the face of another to make them the best type of assassin. I figure that even if Faceless Gal was Arya's test, there'd be no reason for her to go on a GTA slaughtering spree just to get to her. They're supposed to remain at least a BIT more subtle than that, I assume. Why the chase? She could've pretended to be anyone and eventually managed to murder Arya if she wanted to. Not all of this plot was just bad writing - there had to have been a reason for a master assassin to go chasing someone through the city and killing anyone who tried to protect her.

At the end of it all, Sexy Jesus gives Arya a ""you did good kid"" sort of nod after her speech and lets her go.

So....who, or what, was Faceless Gal?",27,42,False,self,,,,,

Will edit out any mistakes or changes i see fit.

Anyway my theory goes that a Targaryen invasion brought together the Seven Kingdoms and now a Targaryen invasion will destroy the Seven Kingdoms and revert it back too before Aegon's conquest. As most know before the Seven Kingdoms, Westeros was seperated into 7 independant realms. When Aegon took Westeros he made each realm kneel and swear fealty to him which allowed him to create the Seven Kingdoms and rule it from Kings Landing.

As the story has grown the Kingdom has been strained, with the North hating the South etc. I think when Dany lands in Westeros she will battle with the south and destruction will lay waste to Kings Landing and all of its surrounding towns. This would coincide with the visions Dany had in the house of undying where she walks through a destroyed throne room.

Dany will defeat the south but at a huge cost, losing most of her army and possibly a dragon. She will then demand that all parts of westeros swear fealty to her like they did to her ancestors 100's of years ago. Most of Westeros will oblige except the North as they have their own king now. 

Dany outraged at this marches north with the rest of her army to take it by force. This will then happen alongside the invasion of the white walkers from the wall. Dany will meet Jon and they will agree that the north will bend the knee once the white walkers are defeated. (The earlier refusal was to make Dany march north so that Jon and the north know they have more fire power to fight against the undead army) 

I think Dany will die and so will her dragons. Most characters will die but not Jon. He will be given the kingdom by right of birth (the realm will find out somehow) but he will refuse it. Instead he will have the iron throne demolished and return Westeros back into its original land. 7 independent realms, all with their own king etc. A peace treaty will be signed so no more wars are fought, completing the cycle that was started 100's of years ago. 

A powerful man made the seven kingdoms, and a powerful man was the one to destroy it.

Let me know what you think, this probably has been spoke about before. Maybe not in the entirety but certain points have definitely been spoken about. Thought about this for a couple of days now and with George R R Martin saying the ending would be ""bitter sweet"" anything could happen.   ",35,19,False,self,,,,,

Instead Mance condemns his own people to death north of the Wall. 

Why?

Some have theorised that Bran crossing the Wall would lead to its magic being rendered useless. I disagree. The mark is a one-time thing because if it were permanent, the Night King could have gotten hold of any person, given them the mark and let them free near The Wall. The Night King grabbing hold of Bran rendered the protections in the cave useless because Bran was in the cave at that point of time, connected to the tree. 3ER felt it because he was also connected to the weirwood tree. Also, the magic in The Wall would be many times stronger than the magic in the cave, just from a logical standpoint.
I think the magic in the wall works like the magic in the cave. If wights try to cross it, they get destroyed. But if a wight is carried by a person/horse/etc, the wight can still come alive. This is why the wight could attack Beor Mormont south of the wall. The wight has to not use magic at the place where the spells are in work.
The White Walkers cannot cross because they are magical beings. Some of them have been alive for at least hundreds of years.

2) How did Bran get visions of the Night King transforming Crastor's son into a White Walker? There must be no weirwood trees in the stronghold of the Walkers, right?

3) Why is the Night King called by that name? Is it related to the naming of the Nights' Watch?",4,5,False,self,,,,,

The others may have been converted from humans by the first Walker (Night King) the same way he turned Crastor's son.

1) Why is dragonglass fatal to Walkers? Does it undo the magic that was done to make them? Or is it only because it is a special kind of magical substance? What are the chances dragonglass is also fatal to the Night King, from whom this magic originates?

2) I think Valyrian Steel needs dragon-fire to be made and hence is fatal to Walkers. Maybe this is why no Valyrian Steel has been made since the Doom. Also, the Iron Throne was made by melting down swords using dragon-fire. What significance could this have in the future?

The only honorable thing to do to repay her kindness was to marry her and not leave her with a bastard. 

Robb was raised by Ned to be an honest and honorable man. So in the spur of the moment he chose to not tarnish the livelihood of a young woman of a noble house versus making and old man who nobody liked happy. We all know how that turned out but Robb did what he thought best in the situation with the resources he had.

**What you might have missed**

At 2pm ET, GoT started livestreaming a block of ice. People were asked to comment ""fire"" [edit: and now, also dracarys] to launch flames at the ice, as it slowly melted. The release date appears to be inside of it.

We've had cameos from:

* Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran), talking about the scary Night's King
* Lena Headey (Cersei), talking about her love of fire
* Gwendoline Christie (Brienne), saying she can't comment on the possibility of a relationship with Tormund
* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime), saying that although he usually isn't a fan of burning them all, we'll want to see what's in the ice
* **Post-reveal, Liam Cunningham (Davos) assures us that it will be ""worth the wait""**

My theory is about Sam being Azor Ahai and not Jon. I do not know if it will be well accepted, but some people who have spoken about the theory have found it very convincing    Sam is the most underrated man in the game of thrones world, but the king of the north's best friend can not be a fat man any . Clause of the 3 requirements of the prophecy for Azor Ahai?  Maybe the Azor has not even come up is yet to come Since the fourth book I have this theory and the sixth season was crucial for this Some writers always maintains this pattern of the strong becoming weak and the weak strong, in the mainly Do Martin stories, If you like the theory share to gain popularity on Reddit and more people read. Please help me spread it around.


 1- It will arise from salt and smoke 


2- When the red star rips the skies


 3-And he will make a great sacrifice


 Sam is in the citadel where smoke comes out of a tower all the time and in the middle of the sea surrounded by salt , The red star (the comet) is crossing the heavens but has not yet ""ripped"" the heavens. And it may fall soon bringing great changes and perhaps the return of magic; He has his nissa nissa, something that can be considered the only true love of the series. She always encourages Sam to become a man and she would perhaps sacrifice herself for him and that would be a great and true sacrifice with enough love to bring the Luminant back to the world.


 As we can see the hawk ahai knew how to bathe weapons in magic. This is something only the greatest blacksmiths or magicians can do in any medieval fantasy world. That is, the hawk would have to know to enchant weapons with magic and knows who always dreamed to be a magician? The Sam


 The motto of his family is ""first in battle"" and is one of the families of the best westeros warriors. They have the sword ""venom of the heart"" which is their ancestral two-handed sword. Venom (something mortal) of the heart (love), maybe it is the luminifera itself erased and we do not know.


 And the prophecy says that it will arise when darkness takes the world. Well ... That has not happened yet. And he fought and got lost all will perish. Sam, you're not a good warrior and need help. Maybe that's the real purpose of Jon and Daenarys. Join the 3 dragon heads and support the Azhai Ahai in their battle against each other and the king of the night


  Sam was also the first to kill a white wanderer, and had it not been for his knowledge acquired in the books the patrol of the night would never know that obsidian (dragon glass) and Valian steel defeat the vagrants. And Jon would probably already be dead. And please ... Review the episodes where Sam has direct contact with the vagrants. Did you notice a pattern? Did you notice that none of them are interested in attacking Sam? Why do the vagrants ignore him? Has lump in this angu.


 Now going to another point.     Jon Snow and Melissandre
 She was sent north by the red god to find the promised prince. She made a mistake and thought it was Stanis, but it was not .. Maybe it was a plan of the red god to clear the way for Jon.    After this she went to the walls and found Jon Snow. She thought he was Azor Ahai. In fact, that's what most people think. Kk. A great warrior conquering the north .. But after events it was banished from the North, so it must be going south or beyond the wall, we do not know yet where the red god will guide it.    But here comes a coincidence. When Melissandre went to the ramparts Sam was leaving, to the south, so she was still in the north because with Jon being the king of the North the battle against the vagrants will be easier. So if she happens to be going south now, maybe she'll meet Sam or maybe Daenarys, I do not rule out the possibility of her being Azor Ahai too, but the theory is focused on Sam, so let's talk about him. Right?


 Sam has always wanted to show his value and has shown an incredible evolution from the start as an intellectual and as a warrior. He taught Jon how to beat the vagrants and was also the first to kill one. Now he is in the citadel where all the knowledge of the world exists and Sam can perhaps learn magic or create Valian steel, in fact he is one of the only ones who has the patience to read several books and likes this


 Martin is a big fan of Lord of the Rings of Tolkien, where the weakest creature was the savior of the world and all fought at his side. Frodo's best friend, maybe the real hero in the story was called Sam .. Yeah .. SAM. Well .. would be a good reference. Maybe Sam plays the role of Frodo in game of thrones next to the three dragon heads.
Not to mention that I think Martin sees himself in Sam. A fat underdog nerd. And now have use as a kind of alter ego
It would be really astonishing, both for readers and viewers, and for the characters themselves in the story if Sam really is the Azor Ahai. Well .. If this theory is correct the Internet collapses kkk It would be an incredible business to shut up his father's mouth like he said ""I am the azor ahai, I am angry now that I want to see huehue""
ty, but something almost no one suspects. Even though he does not know it will have a huge role in history. And if it's a hero, whatever.

So last time we saw Jorah he was sent on a quest to find the cure for his greyscale. So, naturally that would lead him to the ruins of valyria, there he would find like maybe a old book or pages of text, pretty much he finds something. Now, I was curious so I searched up the closet westorosi port from old valryia and found out that it's the port in old Town. Which is where the citadel is. So, my theory is... Jorah goes to the citadel looking for a translation for the book or pages he found, keep in mind the greyscale is spreading. He gets turned down by mostly everyone there for being diseased, except by one maester in training, samwell. Samwell successfully translates the readings and finds out that they're actually instructions on how to make valyirian steel, then he brings it back to Jon , finds out that Dany and Jon are on the same team now (it's going to happen I just know it), and they have dragons which is the key too making valyirian steel. So, they make enough to arm their army and that's pretty much how they're going to even the playing field against the white Walker army. And that's my albeit, not based on much, theory on how Jon gets his hands on more valyirian steel. 

TLDR. Jorah finds shit, the finds sam and now they have more valyirian steel.

TV and book comparison",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5yj0au/everything_so_what_now_tv_and_book_comparison/,LetThereBeSmock,1489106751,"So, I literally just finished reading Dance with Dragons, a bit heart broken with Kevan, happy for Dany, and very excited to see WoW and hopefully DoS. Honestly, I wish I had read the books first. I often speak with my favorite teacher about the show and where I am in the books, and he has broughten up the point of where the books are, and where the TV show is, and how will the books be continued.

What do you guys think will happen? Obviously, it's way too late for some things to be brought in, like Victarion (awesome badass by the way), and Aegon and Jon Connington. But I was glad to see that the show took elements from the books, where Jorah got the greyscale instead.

Do you guys think any major characters will be seen in the future? Any that definitely won't? Any you wanted to see? I personally wanted to see Strong Belwas, since he seems like an awesome and hilarious guy, and would've much preferred that Barristan came in that way. Also, the Hound! I saw this on the Asoiaf wikia, but I had predicted it earlier, that the Hound washed up on the isle of the Blessed or wherever, where Brienne, Pod, and Crabb man were, and he had had the hood over his face I believe, in disguise as he dug graves, which is slightly reflected in the show as well, him being with Brother Ray and working in the sept.

I'm curious for what happens the main characters, specifically Jon, Tyrion, Dany, Bran, and Arya. Jon of course was still stabbed, but in front of the crowd, with Wun Wun freaking out. Of course, he's going to come back some way or another, and it'd only make sense for Melisandre to do it. Tyrion of course had just signed with the Second Sons, as had Jorah, as had Penny. Dany had just been come upon by the other Khalasar, but with Drogon right next to her. Simply, there's so much things that are different. I believe someone compiled a list of where everyone was, and if someone could link it, that'd be sweet! 

It'll be weird seeing GRRM simply writing down what happened, though knowing him, he'll do it justice, then completely splitting off for some things, since that's inevitable. Just some of my thoughts here, I'm glad to have finally finished the books, now I'm with all you others waiting for Winds of Winter. Thanks!",8,2,False,self,,,,,

But with her current engagement with Yara &amp; Theon, allowing them to rule the Iron Islands independently for helping her take Westeros, Tyrion mentioned that everyone is gonna want a piece of that pie.

We already see that near the end with Varys making some sort of ""Fire &amp; Blood"" agreements for the help of the Martells &amp; Tyrells. Who are all probably just in it to say ""eff you"" to Cersei and don't really plan on relinquishing any power to Dany's claim. Not after seeing the Iron Islands agreement.

It's heavily implied Dany &amp; Jon Snow will meet and probably end up working together to take on the White Walkers. Will she also concede the North to Jon out of military convenience and cooperation?

How many territories and lands will she allow to just rule themselves just so she can sit on the Iron Throne?

She's already been tested enough with impatience regarding the constant effort to keep the Bay of Dragon's behaving and not rebelling back to Slavery because her Dragon's aren't there 24/7.

How much more can she be pushed? Before she just up and says ""Eff it. I have Dragons. I have Unsullied. I have Dothraki. Every last one of you are gonna die until you fall in line.

When he falls into a deep sleep, the cold dark winter comes. The creatures and white walkers of his dreams are a nightmare to the people who live in this world. His dreams may be his memories and experiences that cause fantastical happenings in the lands of Westeros and beyond. And he may not be a white walker, but their blue eyes have always made me wonder.

You guys seem to favor Jaime as her heir, but he is a sworn Kingsguard, a Kingslayer, and probably will became a Queenslayer too. Can he reclaim the throne for himself? Don't think so.
The obvious answer is ""Who cares Dany will conquer Kings Landing anyway"", but:

1 That whole thing with her vision in the House of the Undying approaching but not actually touching the Iron Throne;
2 That whole thing with her vision in the House of the Undying going beyond the wall and finding her Drogo and her son; hinting at death beyond the Wall.

Now even if she is Queen of Westeros and dies in combat......... She has no next of kin, Jon is still a bastard, and Tyrion is her Hand.

Very large shadow indeed.

my question is about melisandre in book 5. when john snow learns that the lord of bones is mance she stresses that the bone armor is important in up holding the illusion because bones and certain keep sakes ""remember."" She says, the strongest glamors are built of such things. A dead mans boots, a hank of hair, a bag of finger bones."" Does that imply that since davos lost his finger bag she came by it and is using it to transform someone into him? Idk I was trying to figure out the significance It seems to big a coincidence that in his last chapter davos stress how he lost his luck when he lost his finger bones when he goes to grab for them after lord manderly asks him to look for rickon. While they don't say where rickon went when he left bran, davos seemed shit scared were Wex's dagger landed. And said something about it being a place where people break their fast amongst the flesh of the living Maybe she saw davos die and needs someone of his resemblance later on if he dies during his mission? thought? please i didn't catch this dialogue until i reread the chapter.

The pyre and stake are clearly visible in the background, and Melisandre's ominous 'It will all be over soon, Princess' line is included. It cuts away just as Shireen begins to realize what is about to happen to her.

What I wonder is, *'should they have ended the scene here in the original episode as well?'* Leaving Shireen's tragic fate quite obvious without *technically* confirming it at that point.

The opening scene of the following episode would only seem to support the audience's worst fears. Shireen is absent; Selyse commits suicide; half of Stannis's forces desert him; and Stannis gives Melisandre the cold shoulder when she tries to embrace him. Later on, Davos questions Melisandre about Shireen's fate when she arrives at Castle Black, but her response is only a grim silence.

Had they gone this route, Shireen's fate wouldn't have been officially confirmed until the S6 finale, when Davos presents Melisandre with damning evidence--the fire-damaged stag toy he made for her--and corners her into admitting what happened. A revelation that shakes both Davos and Jon.

In a way, I can't help but think that going this route would have been more fitting with the way they staged Stannis's death, which was done with somewhat atypical restraint. Personally, I always thought it more likely that the scene was meant to be shown directly through Stannis's POV, so the last thing he sees is Brienne's sword *about to* slice into him. Still, until S6 rolled around, and Roose Bolton alluded to having seen Stannis's dead body, I couldn't *completely* rule out the possibility that Brienne, for one reason or another, had a last-minute change of heart and chose not to kill him right then and there.

It might have added a sort of dreaded mystery to S6 as a whole. For instance, when Brienne confronts Davos and Melisandre at Castle Black, she informs them of Stannis's crushing defeat and boasts at having personally executed him, but makes no reference whatsoever to Shireen. At the time of that scene, Davos was grilling Melisandre for answers on what happened to Shireen more than anything else.",20,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

As we know Rhaegar was already married before he ran off with Lyanna and speculation is mounting that he married her making Jon his legitimate son. I believe that he married Lyanna which why there is so much focus on Jon being the prince that was promised. If Jon was just Rhaegar's bastard why would Game of Thrones focus so much on his birth? 

 What is interesting is that during the point Rhaegar is killed and the sack of Kings Landing his Kingsguard is at the Tower of Joy guarding Lyanna and Jon. Why is the Kingsguard there and not protecting either Rhaegar or Rhaegar's heir at the time, Aegon, his firstborn son? Ser Arthur Dayne reveals that Rhaegar wanted him there, but why? Is it because Rhaegar's heir is in that Tower? What about Aegon? Aegon would have been Rhaegar's heir so why wasn't Ser Arthur protecting him? 

This is what I think has happened. I think that Rhaegar annulled his first marriage to Elia Martell in order to marry Lyanna Stark. If he went to a Maester he could have done both at the same time. An annulment of a marriage is basically treating the marriage as if it had never existed. In history, annulling a marriage would also render the children of that marriage as illegitimate. A lot of GOT is based on history, so if Rhaegar annulled his first marriage then, in accordance with history, this move would have effectively made his first two children bastards. If that's the case then it would explain why the Kingsguard were protecting Lyanna and Jon because by annulling his marriage to Elia Martell he would have made his children by her illegitimate making Jon his heir and that is why the Kingsguard were there protecting Jon and Lyanna, and not Elia Martell and her children.

Let's talk about succession, which happens to be very complicated, especially after all legitimate heirs are dead. Once this happens, one of two people can take the Lordship, the former Lords wife, or any bastards of the house. We see this in a political issue cut from the show - the extinction of House Hornwood. The candidates for the title of Lord/Lady of Hornwood are Lawrence Snow, Lord Hornwood's bastard, the Lords of Tallhart, Karstark, and Flint, who married into the house recently, and Donella Hornwood, Lord Hornwood's Wife. Ultimately, the issue is solved when Ramsay Snow marries Lady Hornwood and claims the title for himself. Another Example is Lady Dustin, who 
despite only marrying into the house.

Now, royal succession is different than Noble succession, but we can use this as a basis for the situation as to who gets the Iron Throne.

House Baratheon is extinct. We don't know if there are any minor cousins laying around, but they are certainly further away from the main branch, if they do exist, than the Tallhart's were to the Hornwood's (Lord Tallhart married Lord Hornwood's sister). No acknowledged Baratheon Bastards are alive (Gendry was probably confirmed as a royal bastard when the Lannister's went after him, but people think he was killed). The wife to the last two kings is dead. So there's only one person left in the line of succession - wife to King Robert, Cersei Lannister.

I feel that he's trying to tell his audience: ""this is our history and this is what will come?""

So, what will come?
If we go back in our history, we'll see how the world is fucked up by religious wars! and lately by economic wars.
But, after WW2. Some non-profit global organizations and humanitarian movements pop-up into existence. They eliminated all banners and raised the ONLY banner: ""serving human"".
Thanks to their efforts. The world is finally coming to peace and trying to focus on some global issues such as: global warming, sun blast waves, asteroid threats and AI dominance... etc.
 
Now, if we look to George R.R. Martin fantasy, we'll see how is ruined by wars and how people there are preparing even to greater wars! and they are ignoring the real threat of white walkers.

I feel the only part that can face the real threat is The brotherhood without banners and they may get strength and endorsement from all other parts in the very last episodes of the series. After they been ignored by the folks and narrative focus.

This is exactly what is happening in our world. After 10,000 years of human history with all its mess. The world is finally coming to peace thanks to humanitarian organizations and movements and in short time!

For me I'd say Jon Snow:

Jon has risen to power not by demanding it or invading people's territories. He has earned it through his own means and in his ability to get people to trust him and follow him. He seeks no glory or crown and is completely oblivious to his Royal heritage. He shys away from seeking power but when it's given to him he rises to the occasion. Over the series he has grown from a sulky teenager into a man, a leader and a King. People around him have chosen him as a leader because he's earned their admiration and respect and they look up to him. He is passionate, determined and cares about doing the right thing. 

He has his faults, he is not perfect. He is reckless, headstrong and he has a temper. He also has a tendency to follow his heart and not his head leading him to take huge risks to do what is right, putting the lives of himself and a lot of other people at risk. If he can rein this in he would make an even better leader.

Overall I think he'd make a great King because of his modesty, honour, bravery, sense of duty and he has a good heart. He has great love for his family and all he really cares about is doing what is right. I think his biggest glory is yet to come and that will be when he defeats the Night King. The one who shys away from power is usually the one who makes the better King and that is why I think Jon Snow should be King of Westeros.

#PERSONALITY

Rhaenys was the youngest child of the 3 Dragons that conquered Westeros and second daughter of Aerion Targaryen. 

Her personality was described as: *Playful, curious, IMPULSIVE, and given to flights of fancy.*

Rhaeyns loved to **Dance**. Aryas water dancing is like *ballet*. She is completely enthralled by this style of sword-fighting. Rhaeyns was a fan of **Poetry** and she also *supported many a singer, mummer, and puppeters.* Arya is literally working as a mummer, living and working among them, and she absolutely loves it. Arya remembers fondly learning the speeches in The Conquerors Two Wives (about Aegon &amp; his sister wives). As Mercy, she enjoyed working in the plays and memorized other actors lines for no reason other than her enjoyment. 

~*~

#MYTHICAL BEASTS

Out of the 3 Dragon conquerors, Rhaeyns was the most connected to her dragon.

&gt;Rhaenys and her golden-eyed Dragon called *Meraxes*: It was said that Rhaenys spent more time on dragonback than her brother and sister combined, for above all things she loved to fly.

Arya has the one of strongest connections to the Stark direwolves the golden-eyed Nymeria even though they are separated by a continent. Arya is a warg and a skin-changer. 


Arya not only has a connection with actual Dragons and calls them old friends, but she also wants to grow wings and fly. Arya says wants to see a dragon. GRRM uses dragon imagery in Aryas chapters. She dreams of seeing a Dragon while remembering Old Nans tales, which happen to be the truest foretelling of things to come. She lists 3 things she would want to see: The Titan of Braavos (check), a Kraken (they aren't real, but she saw something similar to a Kraken/see monster while crossing the Trident with the Hound) and a Dragon (yet to happen) 

*Also interesting: GRRM includes an image of Arya gazing at Blarion the Black Dread, which just so happens to be Aegon the Conquers dragon. The only other major characters that are alive in asoiaf that are also depicted in GRRMs book TWoI&amp;F were Jon &amp; Dany.

Image here: http://68.media.tumblr.com/477737e06fd3c80b58239265b660fc05/tumblr_ne64n60zdt1u2n5cyo1_1280.png

~*~

#WHAT IS WEST OF WESTEROS? 

So not only is Rhaeyns the most connected to her dragon and spends the most time on dragonback, she also said she wanted to fly on Meraxes and cross the Sunset sea and discover what is West of Westeros. We know D&amp;D interestingly added this desire with Arya in S6. 

So Rhaeyns is also an adventurer at heart, brave and independent.


#NOT TRADITIONAL WARRIORS

Arya (like her heroine Queen Nymeria) will never be a battlefield warrior like Visenya. Instead, Nymeria was a commander and a leader of her people. This is similar to Rhaenys, who was more a strategist than a combat warrior. 

Rhaeyns also has a vengeful side as we saw with her attack on Storms End:

&gt;Rhaenys wrought vengeance upon the attackers of Orys, robbed them of familiar territory to use in the future, and struck a healthy dose of fear into the stormlords, who warned King Argilac of the dragon and her rider.

When Rhaeyns tried to take Dorne, bravely going on her own the first time, shows how much trust Aegon put in her, and how powerful she was with Meraxes. Rhaenys was fearsome as she threatens Dorne with bloody retribution, Rhaenys replied, but we will come again, princess, and the next time we shall come with fire and blood.

Arya's sense of righteous vengeance is self-explanatory. ;)

#SPYING

Aryas talents in this area are well documented with her training in the HoBW. She also demonstrates early signs of being an excellent spy BEFORE arriving to Braavos: when she was a prisoner in Harrenhal reading Rooses letters or climbing a huge tree at the Gods Eye lake to scout miles ahead for help. Rhaenys also used this ability, Spying from dragonback, Rhaenys could report the movements of the Storm Kings host without Argilac himself having any way to counter her scouting (as he might have with traditional ground-based scouts).


#QUEENSHIP

Rhaenys focused on building allegiances and paid particular attention to the smallfolk (A common trait shared with Queen Alysanne Targaryen) and another strong link with the Stark child most linked with the smallfolk. Even before everything went to hell, a highborn Arya at Winterfell valued people for who they were - even if they were lower class and below her own highborn station. Arya was always curious and loved to listen to their stories and learn about their lives, and saw no class and just saw them as human beings. Arya has a natural charm, friendly and connects with people instantly:


&gt;Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father's table and listen to them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used to call her ""Arya Underfoot,"" because he said that was where she always was. 

 *

&gt;Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody.

Arya even risks her own life to save a 3 year old lowborn orphan girl from burning alive in the flames. Before this moment, she ran into this battle screaming, Winterfell! Winterfell! Winterfell! 

Aryas treatment and regard for Northmen are well pointed out in the books. She prays for their release while in the Godswood at Harrenhal. She calls them her pack. Her people.

&gt;After everything Arya went through in the Riverlands, being a prisoner at Harrenhal, with the Hound and the BwB and her training with the FM The Arya we knew in Winterfell is still under there, charming as ever and a magnet for the smallfolk:

Arya intervenes as Cat and saves Sam from those Braavosi thugs. 

&gt;Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, Brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. (Cat of the Canals, A Feast for Crows)
[Merrys] girls were nice as well; Blushing Bethany and the Sailors Wife, one-eyed Yna who could tell your fortune from a drop of blood, pretty little Lanna, even Assadora, the Ibbenese woman with the mustache. They might not be beautiful, but they were kind to her. - (Cat of the Canals, A Feast for Crows)


#CLOSEST RELATIONSHIP

Aegon loved Rhaeyns the most, their closeness being the reason he married her for **love**, despite already marrying having Visenya first. He openly makes his affection for Rhaeyns obvious. Aegon was more distant with Visenya and treated his marriage with her as one of **duty**.


Arya closest relationship in the books has always been with Jon. 

Boht Aegon &amp; Jon are faced receiving letter over their captive/sister whom they loved dearly. Both Aegon &amp; Jon choose their sister over duty. 

More detail:

Rhaeyns goes to Dorne to put down another rebellion when her dragon Meraxes is killed and Rhaeyns is never seen again. Her body is never returned to Kings Landing. There are many theories on how she died. 2 years pass, Dorne later send Rhaeyns dragons skull to her husband King Aegon as a cruel taunt. But Dorne also wanted peace and Aegon receives a letter and his reaction:

&gt; King Aegon was determined to refuse the offer (of peace with Dorne) until Princess Deria placed in his hands **a private letter from her father**, Prince Nymor. Aegon read it upon the Iron Throne, and men say that when he rose, **his hand was bleeding, so hard had he clenched it. He burned the letter** and departed immediately on Balerions back for Dragonstone. When he returned the next morning, it was done. **He had agreed to the peace and signed a treaty to that effect.** (Dorne: Dorne Against the Dragons, The World of Ice and Fire)

It is commonly believed that what was said in that the letter revealed Rhaeyns was currently captive and being tortured in the most horrible ways by the Ullers - a sadistic House avenging Rhaeyns last visit to Dorne where she burned the place up with her dragon!

Weakening his own position and risking rebellion among other powerful Houses. He never thought twice. He gave Dorne the peace they asked for.

*

Jon faces a similar dilemma in ADWD, when his most loved sister is held captive and married off to another sinister family - House Bolton (much like the Ullers in Dorne). Notice Jon's reaction once he received yet another Letter and learns the rescue of Arya had failed: 

&gt;Snow? said Tormund Giantsbane. You look like your fathers bloody head just rolled out o that paper. 

After reading the first letter, Jon looks physically sick after reading the first letter with Aryas marriage proposal. Jon wants to choke Ramsay to death with his own bare hands.

Eventually he makes a decision:

&gt;And where will you be, crow? Borroq thundered. Hiding here in Castle Black with your white dog?

&gt;No. I ride south. Then Jon read them the letter Ramsay Snow had written...

&gt;I have my swords, thought Jon Snow, and we are coming for you, Bastard. - (Jon, A Dance with Dragons)

Jon gathers his forces to march to Winterfell in Arya Starks name. I love the fact that House Flints are among the Northmen marching. Arya is named after Arya Flint, Neds grandmother. The Flints were former Kings of Winter and have the blood of the First Men. Aryas name literally means Noble or ""Nobility"". (side note: The Name ""Arwen"" also means ""noble maiden"")
Jon has broken his vows, too many for some brothers in black and they end up killing him for it.

Jon dies thinking about his lost sister. *""Stick em with the pointy end""*

Let me backtrack a little :)

It can clearly be seen that the Starks are connected to their Dire Wolves, but I think they serve an even deeper purpose than we realize. Whatever happens to the Stark's Dire Wolves will also happen to them. From the very beginning you can see this. When they first find the Dire Wolves the parent Dire Wolf had been killed by a stag (the symbol of House Baratheon) and Ned Stark was killed by Joffrey Baratheon. Arya's wolf ran off and was never seen again by anyone. Arya disappeared and nobody knew where she was (also there are rumors that Arya's wolf is coming back just like Arya). Rob's wolf was killed at the wedding with crossbows and so was Rob. Rickon's wolf was killed by men looking to join Ramsey and Ramsey killed Rockon. Bran's wolf was killed in the cave by the white walkers. This is the one issue with this theory. As you could make the argument that Bran also died in that cave, with ""Hold The Door"", and became the 3 Eyed Raven or that he will die at a later time. Obviously Jon and Ghost are a couple of badasses :)

This leaves us with Sansa Stark. Sansa's wolf was killed by Ned Stark because he had no choice and so Sansa will die by the hands of a Stark that has no choice but to kill her as well. That means there are two possible people that can kill her. Either Arya or Jon. I'm gonna say it will be Jon. That is because Little Finger is gonna be the final villain of the show and he will manipulate Sansa into helping him. As a result of her betrayal, Jon will have no choice but to kill Sansa.",47,80,False,self,,,,,

It's all very mystical and there seems to be heavy foreshadowing--- except, in hindsight, it's not really foreshadowing. There's a direwolf with stag antlers in it (the symbol of house Baratheon). I'm pretty sure Ned even thinks about how that's a bad sign since the Baratheons are coming. 
The Starks do ultimately get hurt pretty bad, so the dead wolf makes sense, but when are the Baratheons responsible for it? Robert makes a pretty big point of keeping Ned around even through his dissent, and puts a lot of trust in him. It's Joffery who kills Ned, then the Lannisters and Frey's that kill Robb and Catelyn. If anything, the Baratheons seem to like the Starks.
I know Joffery was thought to be a Baratheon, but in some heavenly symbol like that, wouldn't it know what Joffery really was. I guess a Lion being that far north wouldn't really make sense.
Is there some reason why the Stag kills the direwolf, or has that yet to be explained?",9,7,False,self,,,,,

The seventh season debuts on 16 July in the US on HBO and will consist of seven episodes. Weiss and Benioff said last year that they had planned to finish the series in just thirteen more episodes after the explosive finale to Season 6. HBO had refused to confirm that, hoping that the producers could be talked into making more episodes. Clearly that effort has failed.

The final two seasons have the same budget as the sixth ($100 million), bringing the per-episode budget of the series up to $14,280,000. In Season 8 this will increase to $16,660,000 per episode (a massive five times the budget of an episode of The Walking Dead, for comparison). Game of Thrones is, easily, the most expensive ongoing TV show in television history.

The eighth and final season of Game of Thrones will begin production towards the end of this year and will air in summer 2018. HBO are in early discussions with George R.R. Martin about making a possible spin-off series to replace it, but have not announced any firm plans. Such a series will not involve Benioff or Weiss, who have a movie development deal with Fox Studios.",128,351,False,self,,,,,

It does neither contain nor contradict most content-related fan theories.

I always liked the idea that everything we are told is just another perspective on the same matter. I will progressively explain what I mean with this, leading you to my theory with aspects that get increasingly deep. 

###Gods and Religion 
It's probable that all religions are equal. E. g. the seven Gods being facets of the one God. People do magic based on religion, people do magic without religion, no one is almighty, no one generally fails. It would be ridiculous if we were finally told *These people were right and these people were wrong*, both based on the past and the indication.

This is an example to show how it all focuses on perspectives. Thats why we dont face classic good vs. evil, but good&amp;evil vs. good&amp;evil. Every conflict and every character is ambivalent.

###Make me one with everything 
Arya and Melisandre shapeshift. Bran and Pyat Pree use transcendental mind. These are not only different things, they are opposites, and they add up to ultimate capability. If you can be everything, and know everything, what are your limits? What Im up to here is that although all of these are understood differently, they have the same origin. They are parts, perspectives of a higher idea. A spiritual belief of everything being one, being in harmony: viewing the world as an organism.

###A song of ice and fire 
So we have come down to the title. While its not just a beautiful metaphor for a conflict, it contains a whole heap of concepts. Ice and fire being opposites is obvious, and the metaphor is recurring. In the process of their conflict, they neutralize each other. Now the title also contains *song*, and thats important. A song is music, its beauty, and it tells a story. Good titles abstract the idea of a tale. A song ends.

At this point I want to predict that ultimately, the world we know collapses. Not being fuzzy. It dies, annihilating itself. At most leaving behind water and air, a corpse. Maybe rebirth, maybe not. Chaos. Aether. Nothing.
 
###Seasons 
Ice and fire can certainly be an analogy to winter and summer. Have you ever seen a symbolic interpretation of the circumstance that seasons duration is variable? I provide one. Summer is good times, winter is bad times.

Who experiences good and bad times? Living beings. Humans. Every good time we have is different, just like every bad time. They differ in kind, consequences, intensity, and duration. I say the seasons we are shown represent the world being moody, capricious.
***
###The theory of everything 
The whole song of ice and fire is illustrating the inside of a human. A human life, a human mind.

So I know that the series only has 13 episodes left. While this is sad, it's good it's getting a proper ending. The only concerns I have involve how the ending actually plays out. I don't think the series can end with Daenerys or Jon becoming Queen/King, because this is Game of Thrones after all and there really wouldn't be any closure. For example, Jon could become King but then get assassinated the very next day. The only way I can see the ending having closure is if the white walkers win. GRRM said the ending is going to be bittersweet, and I think this ending could work perfectly. It's happy because there aren't any more houses and the treachery of the world is completely eliminated, but it's sad because all of our favorite characters die.

We already know a lot about roberts rebellion, the dance of dragons, and aegons conquest from the books, so i don't think those would be necessary to base a whole new series on. I'd rather see what happened before all that, the parts that we don't know about.

I want to see what Asshai and Valyria looked like. Maybe a series about an explorer who goes out to see what lies beyond the mapped region of the world and on the way we get to see all these old civilizations that have so far only been talked about in stories, until we get to see the completely unexplored regions of this world.

It's starting to make me wonder when we'll see anyone else other than Dany ride the dragons. The Night King will reportedly capture Viserion and ride him but does this acknowledge the 3 heads of the dragon theory or has it gone off track?

The most obvious character who is likely to be able to ride one is Jon. Now they've pretty much revealed he's half Targaryen they have an opportunity to explore this side of this character and a meeting with Dany should start to show this side of him. It would be nice to see him develop a relationship with the dragons, similar to Dany's, throughout season 7 whilst he's on Dragonstone to the point where he can mount one of them by the end of the series. I'm really hoping the producers don't ignore this side of Jon.

Then there is the possibly that there maybe another but who else could possibly ride a dragon?

The producers just seem to be determined to round off series and I hope they don't miss out adding other dragonriders as I'd like to see someone else ride a dragon as well as Dany. ",14,6,False,self,,,,,

There will be only those, who managed to survive the white walkers invasion, and the herritage won't have any importance anymore. And those on the ground, who survived (so, Arya - who was a servant and a beggar, Tyrion, who was a slave and other children of great houses, who were in the ground) will be in charge of the new world, which will appear in place of Westeros.

I began with S1E1 last night and was wondering what others look for when watching this show a second (or third..) time.

The first thing that caught my eye was the fact that half the main cast from the opening credit is dead. Another was how young and innocent they make Daenerys look when meeting Khal Drogo. Seeing her physical change from back then to a Queen crossing the Narrow Sea is incredible. The stag killing the direwolf is something that was initially over my head, but now I see that kind of foreshadowing in many places.

Then he makes his escape from the castle with ... his girlfriend and her baby. On the back of a cart. Travelling on the road. To Oldtown, where his Father knows he is going.

Question: Why doesn't Randall or Dickon get up on a horse, ride south towards Oldtown and catch up to Sam and punch him in the face and take the sword back? Remember that Randall and Dickon, in the two times they are brought up in the show (S1 and S6) are both skilled riders and hunters. We don't know if they can read, but they can ride and hunt. They can certainly follow a family hitchhiking on the back of an apple cart on the way to a known destination. Medieval societies didn't have very many main roads, so there couldn't be more than 1 or 2 routes to Oldtown from the Tarly lands. And Randall has an entire army at his disposal if he's too busy to go himself. He has scouts and cavalry. He can spare 10 riders to travel every road to Oldtown and get that sword back.

This is the same Randall Tarly who in Season 1 threated to straight-up murder his own son Sam rather than allow him to inherit the sword. Kinslaying, a crime against the gods and men, meant less to Randal Tarly than allowing Sam to inherit the family lands and sword.

The Night King grabbed Bran in his vision which led to the White Walkers breaking the magic and killing everyone not named Meera or Bran. If Bran crosses the Wall with the mark left behind by the Night King, the Wall will lose its magic and White Walkers will be able to march south.

Here is what I think will happen.

The three-eyed-raven told Bran that he fucked up by letting the Night King touch him. If Bran knows that the mark on his right arm is the White Walkers' key into the south, he will do something about it. The simplest way to deal with it is to cut it off. 

But who else lost part of their right arm? Jaime, the man who pushed him off the tower. After cutting part of his right arm off and crossing the Wall, Bran somehow reunites with Jaime but I have no idea how this meeting will go. Maybe they do a left-handed handshake and banter about their one-armed lives. Jaime says, ""you only have one limb"" and Bran replies, ""but I can fly"".

Some thoughts . .,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5ze8z9/tvi_read_the_book_and_just_watched_season_1_for/,MR_Rictus,1489519111,"I read Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings a few years before season 1 aired. I never bothered to watch the show and had, up to this binge watch, only seen, cumulatively, maybe 5 minutes of the show. I dont expect there to be anything enlightening here, just thought some of the veterans would enjoy reading about someone who just watched season 1 for the first time. I remember less about Clash of Kings than Game of Thrones and since Ive only watched season 1 Im trying to keep it limited.

I appreciate any discussion or comments you have, but if you could no spoilers.

* Cersei and Jon Snow are about the only two characters that resemble how I pictured them in my mind. Varys is spot on too, but I imagined a higher pitched voice.

* Catelyn seems less sympathetic in the show than she did in the books. I don't know if that is how she's being portrayed, how I read the book, or if the tragedy around her isn't a surprise to me because I've read the book.

* Sansa I dislike more in the show than I did even in the book.  Don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family.

* I don't remember Theon Greyjoy in the book, but in the show I'm just waiting for him to turn on the Starks.

* The death of Robert Baratheon seemed anti-climactic. Maybe because I knew it was coming, maybe not.

* Aidan Gillen/Littlefinger seems like the poorest casting choice of the show to me. I don't dislike him. I just don't think he fits the part from what I remember of the book.

* I see why Peter Dinklange gets so much praise for his work in the show. He does have the most to work with as far as character though. However, I think his accent is the worst on the show. Tagging on to this Jerome Flynn/Bronn is doing a very good job as well.

* I still can't figure out who this story is supposed to be about. I remember thinking the book series was going to be about Snow and/or Daenerys as the central character(s). I got that feeling less and less as I read on.

* The way the show approaches the narrative works better for me in keeping the whole thing straight. The structure of the book, number of characters, different plots took a lot more effort.

* At least 95% of the names are pronounced differently than how they sounded in my head when reading the book.

* I dont remember there being any homosexual relationship for Renly in the book.

* I loathe the white walkers because I fear they will have greater importance as things progress. I find the drama of the seven kingdoms far more entertaining.

* I forgot about Jamie getting captured so that was a surprising twist for me.

* It bothers me the way different characters pronounce Arya. Some Aya. Some Arya.

* The whole Hands Tournament seemed like a bigger deal in the book.

* The wall is taller than I imagined.

* I pictured Viserys and Daenerys to be younger when reading the book.

When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""

Now then this can be interpenetrated in a few ways but does it mean Drogo will return. Let's go through each way i think it is interpenetrated:

A. She is pregnant with Daario's child and when the Seas go dry (Euron attacks) And Mountain blows in the wind like leaves (????) When your womb quickens again (Daario's child) and you bear a living child then he will return (her true love) and not before and either Drogo returns or it is not so straight forward and her true love returns. Not drogo but Jorah Mormont

B. She will die baring a child (the child goes with her as well) and she will return to her love Drogo in the after life

C. Now this could be a situation where what was said was misinterpreted and that it is not when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east but when the son sets in the east and rises in the west. When Jon was stabbed he set in the east and when he was brought back he rose in the west. Meaning that Jon may get Daenerys pregnant and Drogo will either return through the child or Drogo will somehow magically return some how.

I hope A is true to be honest.  ",9,0,False,self,,,,,

The Sigil teaser had elements of both the War of the Five Kings events as well as the White Walkers at the end. In past seasons, it has been very doable to separate the White Walker and Jon Snow storyline with the other major storylines. However, I can't see that with the White Walker invasion imminent. Whatever is left of the crows, the North and the wildlings can in no way stop the White Walker attack on their own. The rest of Westeros (and Essos?) has to get involved or there is going to be a major one sided victory and frankly utter annihilation at the hands of the wight army. And even if you believe that those few groups can put up a fight against the Others, I would be very surprised if Jon Snow's story and Daenerys' story don't overlap. 

So that begs the question, will we get the Living vs. the White Walkers or the Daenerys vs Cersei war first? Will one be the focus of Season 7 and the other Season 8? Can there be two ongoing wars between both seasons? Can Bran or Sam discover a major weakness that will allow it to be an easier fight? Let me know what you guys think. ",7,6,False,self,,,,,

Now that R+L=J has been confirm, everyone is speculating as to how Jon will find out about his lineage and, more importantly, verify it so that he can stake his claim to the Iron Throne. This is based on the assumption that Rhaegar and Lyanna intend to keep his identity a secret until the end of time. However, while it makes total sense for Lyanna to want to hide the baby's identity from Robert, there is no reason to believe that Rhaegar would not want their son legitimized. After all, the baby has a rightful claim on the throne and these folks are obsessed with that thing. So I'm thinking that the pregnancy may have been documented specifically to ensure that Jon can inherit the throne, restoring the Targaryen dynasty. And perhaps said document has made it's way to the Citadel, where a certain someone has just arrived. This could be how Jon finds out, but more importantly, how his claim is validated. 

This only works if Lyanna and Rhaegar were married, but I believe Arthur Dane's presence indicates that it's not just Lyanna's life he's protecting, but rather the true born son of the heir to the Iron Throne.

I'm notoriously bad for not learning names in films and while I got the general gist of the plot a lot of the smaller details were lost on me.

But I went back and rewatched the whole show from episode 1 and its incredibly how much more enjoyable it is when you understand the intricacies of the relationships. It adds an additional layer of meaning to the show as a whole.

Stannis in particular feels far more fleshed out the second time through now I understand his role in the plot.

The only other thing I noticed is, the show got for me weaker as it went on. Especially season 5. The whole Arya plot line, the Danny plot with the local politics we really couldn't care at all about. That was definitely a low point of the show for me that introduced a lot of new characters outside the core of the plot. Hopefully Season 7 reverses this trend.",75,339,False,self,,,,,

Most of us know that when Samwell is digging latrines at the Fist of the First Men, when he finds the bag of obsidian wrapped in the black cloak,  we later learn the use and value of the obsidian. What he also found in that pile is a horn, it is casually mentioned. This cache that was found turned out to be very important, so I don't think that the casual mentioning of a horn being placed here is just benign.

 Does this horn come in use later? Is it the horn that the wildlings claim to exist that they looked for that can bring down the wall? Or is it the mythical horn that can control the dragons? Or maybe it was someone's favorite drinking horn.


Just for fun theorizing, if it can bring down the wall, what situation could arise that the MOTNW would need to bring down the wall? Maybe it was set there to bring peace if you are in the camp that the series will end in with a truce with the Ice Borg which caused the wall to be built to begin with.

In the show, it was revealed the the Children of the Forest (COTF) keep a lot of historical information that they only revealed a little bit of to Bran, and that there is a lot more to the story or the story was changed to keep information from Bran.


It if you want to delve into tin foil hat land, maybe there is something worse out there chasing the White Walkers, and they will need the wall to fall in order to pass. Or the horn is to stop the Walkers themselves or used to communicate with them. If there is a small theme running through the book and show, it is that no matter how bad something or someone is, there is always something or someone worse. Maybe the Ice Borg move south to take over because there is something worse behind them that they are running from.

Nothing is rarely mentioned in this series unless it has importance, so I find it hard to believe that the horn was mentioned to be with along a very important discovery of the dragonglass. We also don't know the fate of this horn, does Sam still have it? Was it left behind? Was it given to someone else who was also given dragonglass? Did someone else pick it up and it will come into play?

Or Does it come into play later in the series that I don't know about yet?

Thank you for any responses or discussion on this. Obviously as a GOT fan, I like a good mystery, but don't mind spoilers. Have a good day!

That being said, I'll give this a shot.

So, a lot of people view Rhaegar and Lyanna as being consensual (not kidnapped).  Therefore, leading these same people to believe that Rhaegar was a good man (as outlined by Ser Barristan) and not a kidnapper.  We learn that Lyanna, and I'm paraphrasing, is kind and gentle (but wild like Arya), so it's easy for people to agree that she was a good person as well.  With all that being said, I have to say...I disagree.

If Rhaegar was a ""good person"" he wouldn't have:  Been the reason Brandon Stark rode south just to get his sister back, been the reason Rickard Stark had to go pay for Brandon's decision with is life (Brandon with is as well), been the reason The Mad King called for Ned and Robert's heads leading to the raising of banners...and war.  He also had a wife, and cheating is still cheating.  Now, I know these aren't all completely his fault, and most of the blame for the war can be placed on the Mad King's shoulders.  However, at some point you have to realize that whatever his reasons for wanting Lyanna, whether they be love or lust (kidnapping), were getting a lot of people killed.  All this because he wanted one woman.  Before people say, ""Well all the Starks and their allies had to do was not start a war"", they are under the impression she's been kidnapped...so they have every right to think they were rescuing her.  I get it sucks not being able to have the woman you want, but I don't think war is the way to go about it.

If Lyanna was a ""good person"" she wouldn't have:  Run off with Rhaeger without telling anyone (sending a Raven to Ned or anyone really), she had to be smart enough to know her family would look into the matter.  I, also, think she would learn that her:  father and brother had died and that Ned was going into war because of her decision.  Now this is the point where some people might say, ""Maybe she didn't like her family or she was being forced into a marriage she didn't want"", and to this I say...is war where multiple people die the right answer?

Now, I understand my use of ""Good man/woman/person"" will be met with, there are not 100% good or bad people, but I use it more in the way that:  Ned was a good man, Jon is a good man, Davos is a good man--they have their flaws and have done their wrongs, but they are generally seen by the audience as good people.  

Which leads me to the point I'm trying to make (probably badly).  I don't like to think that our ""hero's"" (Jon) story began with his selfish parents making decisions that caused a war and killed a lot of people, nor do I like the idea that Rhaegar was this predator who kidnapped Lyanna and she is the ""damsel"" in distress.  However, Rhaegar did fight in the war, and I have to believe he thinks he is justified in the end.  What do you think?  Do you see Rhaegar in a negative or positive light?  Do you see Lyanna in a negative or positive light?  I see their decisions as selfish and think Rhaegar truly believed he was doing nothing wrong (seen more negatively), and that Lyanna realized what they caused when it was too late to reverse (seen more positively).  

Thanks, hope this wasn't too stupid!

Danaerys Targaryen:

She has likely around 6,000 Unsullied left. She bought the 8,000 but ended up taking all the ones who weren't fully trained so I imagine she had more. I'd imagine that 40,000 Dothraki is a solid guess. More came with her but they can't all be warriors. Feel free to disagree here. With Ellaria and Olenna with her I imagine she'll have 40,000 Tyrell loyalists and 45,000 Dornish troops. 

Total: ~130,000 Troops at the moment



Cersei Lannister: 

The mighty may have fallen, but they likely have solid military power between any control they have left from the Westerlands to the Crownlands. From the West they probably get 40,000 Troops. Hurting a bit from the wars but still likely doing well since they were on the winning side. I also imagine she'll get help from any pretenders in the Reach and we were just introduced to one possible one. Throw in 20,000 troops possibly. The Crownlands can likely give an additional 10,000-15,000. 

Total: ~75,000 Troops with some luck



Jon Snow: 

The weakest of the 3 major groups but unlikely to have too much conflict in the south. The Knights of the Vale were caught up in cheering for the King in the North, but Petyr still seems to own them. However, 45,000 men including knights are theoretically with him. The North has maybe 16,000 fighting men left after the civil war. Then possible Tully loyalists could add a few thousand. Since he'll be fighting the white walkers we can add the few hundred remaining nights watch if we wish to them. 

Total: ~65,000 Troops with a lot of luck



The Stormlands were devastated by the loss at the Battle of Winterfell but I wouldn't mind seeing more of them on any of the remaining sides. My bet is they would join Dany.
The Brothers without Banners would also be a solid group to add to most likely Jon's group.


These numbers could be off but I was bored at work so I put something together. ",45,23,False,self,,,,,

- First Jorah was Reborn admits salt and smoke when he saw Dany awake from the Funeral Pyre the smoke from the pyre and the salt from the Dothraki sea as seas have salt.

- Jorah was under the red comet when it was there

- Finally Jorah awoke dragons out of stone when his life changed yes he did not awake them but his life chamged in that moment meaning in some way he awoke dragons out of stone (or could be another big moment coming up later in the story that has not happened yet. Maybe related to Dragonstone or the dragon in the crypts)

North he went, carrying a Stark boy on his back.

he was always in it, up for the fight.

His whole life leading to this mission, to which he had been assigned.

Winter had come, and Summer had died.

Bran's made a situation, that I have to mend. 

Because true friendship means doing things for others, 

Meera my little sister, and Bran my little brother.

This is my moment, and now my Hold begins. 

Farewell my companions, for I am not hateful, 

You gave my life meaning, and for that I am grateful.

Anyways, the more I hear GRRM speak the more worried I get. Hear me out, he constantly talks about a ""bittersweet ending"" and his love for Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings series. We all obviously know the ending of Lord of the Rings. Which scares me a little bit.. do you think he'd make an ending as simple as no one being on the throne at the end? Not as in all the main characters die (some obviously will) but they all come to a consensus that having one true ruler hasn't really worked. If this was the case, I think they would decide to have some sort of 'governing' but not one person on the throne. 

As I go through the series again I'm intrigued when Dany gets a vision of herself in kings landing and the red keeps/throne room is completely burned to ashes.

Would a genius like GRRM actually do something this simplistic? I hope not..

The show runners could change the ending if that's the case?

Thanks for reading!",32,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

She literally has no personally attributable skill that can be considered admirable - she sucks at combat (don't remember ever seeing her even fighting) and is even worse at ruling cities (she literally destabilized every city she stepped into). And why the hell is she seeing every subject's grievances one-by-one? At least form some crude court system to help you take care of majority of those so she can focus on more important things that a multi-regional ruler would have. She even sucks at raising the one thing most unique to her: her dragons. She puts two of her dragons perpetually in a dark cave; seriously wtf! That's worse than the ""dragons are not slaves"" BS she burned the previous Unsullied owner with! If the dragons are getting out of hand, at least try training them; locking up in a dungeon only weakens them and makes them distrust her more. And to top it off, she has such an immature understanding of justice - *some* slavers put *some* slave children on crosses, so execute *all* slavers and put them on crosses. Anyone with some common sense would at least consider giving the slavers a choice. And her whole thing about abolishing slavery *at once* makes little sense as well; the cities at Slaver's Bay are built by centuries of a slave system. Breaking such a system overnight and with nothing appropriate to replace it is obviously never going to end well. She's easily one of the dumbest of the rulers in GoT. The only interesting thing about her is her ability to resist fire.

And the only reason she has so much power is due to the things *given* to her somehow: the dragons, the Unsullied, and for advisors probably some of the best people in all of GoT world (formerly Jorah, Barristan, Grey Worm, and Daario). Apart from the fire resistance, she has no personal quality deserving of her power or of the awesome things above.",46,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

The etymology of the name Nymeria is of interest. I think the name means 'name and place'. Arya has been without a name and a place since Nymeria left her.

I will explain. 'nym' is an affix meaning 'name'. The word 'synonym' means 'same name'. Syn is for same, and the nym is for name. 'eria' is an affix for 'place'. The word 'cafeteria' means 'coffee place'. Cafe is coffee, eria is a place.

After finishing the game and finding the North Grove, I was wondering whether all that happened (or any of it for that matter) is canon with the TV show. I only say the TV show and not the books, because AFAIK it's based entirely off the show. 

I think the North Grove lore given and the fact there is a power there that helps fight against the forces of evil north of the Wall is very interesting, and I'm curious to see whether that could tie into the role Bran plays somehow. One of the leaders at the North Grove also happens to be a Warg.

The storyline following the Forrester's I found quite interesting and I enjoyed looking at evens in the world from their standpoint during the events that were already taking place, such as the Red Wedding. I highly doubt we will see any Forrester's in the TV show, but I'm still curious as to whether the events followed are canon.

The prophecy:

&gt; There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.

I have long stated that I believed Sam to become Azor Ahai by killing Gilly with the sword Heartsbane. It fits with name of the sword and the general concept of the unlikely hero. But the opposite could also be true: have Gilly kill Sam, and then she becomes Azor Ahai. It would serve as a twist on at least fronts: killing a beloved character in a dramatic fashion, and following the theme of female prowess when everyone expects Azor Ahai to be a man. 

The how and when is completely up in the air, but it would have to be death-by-necessity, as neither Sam nor Gilly would willing kill each other.

It has STELLAR direction, AMAZING music, EPIC action and is incredibly fun and entertaining to watch. It's on a different level of cinematic quality than anything we see today: BUT; the writing was honestly pretty mediocre now that you look at it without rose colored glasses, let's take a look:

- PLOT ARMOUR: none of our main characters die, nor even get hurt for that matter in the battle. Jon was literally invincible, with arrows landing conveniently around him and not on him, which is something of Loony Tunes standards. The battle portrayed very realistic violence and death, but just not for Davos, Jon or Tormund, this series always showed the danger of war and battles, so why is this an exception? We've seen Jon get hurt before, so there should be no excuse, they don't all have to die; but at least damage them up a bit i.e lose a finger, break a bone or two, lose an eye etc...

- LITTLEFINGER: Him coming in at the last second with the Knights of the Vale: how predictable was that? VERY. It was such a cliche and common trope, known as an ex machina; where our heroes are looking to be defeated until something comes out of nowhere just at the right time to save them. It was just way too easy, and too convenient. 

- WUN-WUN: They Nerfed Wun-Wun! Why Again? He only killed about 2 soldiers in whole battle for some reason...and not to mention that they didn't give him any weapon, which would have made the battle a whole lot easier if they did. We've seen Wun-Wun use a log before at Hardhome, so why not here? You think that they would think of that. While yes, it would be overpowered: he would have still died anyway due to how big of a target he was, but just dying with more kills obviously.

- LOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES: How didn't Ramsay know about the Knights of the Vale army? No scouts reported them coming beforehand? A ride from Moat Cailin to Winterfell with an army takes a while, other towns and houses would see them, the message would get to Ramsay way before they showed up. ALSO, Sansa somehow knows Ramsay hasn't fed his dogs in seven days, despite LEAVING before he said it at the parley earlier. And of course, Rickon not zig-zagging.

I'm not trying to hate on the battle, or the show: I still love it greatly. I just think that there was some really sloppy writing in what is regarded as the ""BEST"" episode in the series, and it winning an emmy for writing doesn't add up either. This is just a broader look, and a more critical thinking to something so amazing as BastardBowl.",32,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Rhaegar's love for Lyanna lead to the death of his duty as Prince of Dragonstone and his decision to elope with Lyanna lead to an all out rebellion and the death of most of his family. Now only Dany and Jon survive that dynasty.

Is Jon about to make the same mistake and how will that cost him?

The impression I get from the descriptions is that Jon is very much like Rhaegar in ways of personality. Both are portrayed as handsome, nobel, good men who people follow because they believe in them and love them. However both have one Achilles heel: love. Both are driven by their hearts more than their heads and this is was Rhaegar's mistake, and will it be Jon's too?

Jon will meet Danerys this season and it's very likely he will fall in love with her. What are the consequences of this? At the end of the season Jon reportedly yields to Danerys. Why does he do this? Why give up something that was so graciously given to him by the Northern lords? For duty or for love? 

Is this where Jon abandons his duty? His growing love for Danerys and his desperation to defeat the Night King will leave the lines blurred and I believe this will fuel his decision to yield. Cementing his relationship with Dany at the end of the season following his yield is setting him up for some potentially serious consequences when he gets back to the North. 

Remember Jon's words to Stannis 'Northerners are a bit like the Free Folk. Loyal to their own'.
Lady Mormont repeatly makes it clear that she only reckonizes the King in the North who's name is Stark. Jon is arguably not a Stark, he's bastard. For Lady Mormont and the rest of the Northern Houses to make him King is a rare exception. So for him to then yield to Danerys could be seen as a breach of trust. What will be worse is when he is revealed to be a Targaryen himself and he has just given the North away to another Targaryen. Will the North accept Jon's decision? I very much doubt it.

Will this result in the Northern Houses rebelling against him? Is Jon setting himself up for a fall? 

At the most critical point in the story where Jon needs the most support is he about to make a critical mistake which will cause the North to rebel against him? 

Is he about to lose everything he has worked so hard to build because he will make the costly mistake of falling in love? I only hope the rest of House Stark will come to the rescue and make Jon see the error of his ways and turn it around before the North turns on him. He can't afford for them to do that.

Like father like son. Will Jon's future turn out the same way as his father's or will he see the consequences of his actions before it's too late?

How will game of thrones end? (TV SERIES). In my personal opinion, I think in Cersei and Jamie will die Jaime will kill Cersei and kings landing will be destroyed and so will the iron throne making the 7 kingdoms separate once more. I feel as the sand snakes and their mother will be killed in the war for the iron throne between Cersei and Dany or they will die in the white walker war. There will be a new person ruling dorne. In high garden a new family will rule and Olenna will be killed in the kings landing war. In the storm lands I feel as there will come a new family. In the vale I feel the same. In the riverlands I feel as if Edmure will rule. In the north I think Arya will leave to travel the world, Sansa and Jon will marry and rule the north, and bran will be in a tree in the gardens of winterfell for a long time. I feel Daenerys and Tyrion will die and the dragons as well in the white walker battle. I feel all the northern characters will live and stay with Jon and Sansa. I also think the red woman will die and all magic will leave the realm. What do you guys thinking of this ending?",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Okay i am going to get this out of the way Arya is still alive. She was stabbed get over it besides they have a reason and that was to show Arya can be hurt it was a reminder for her she is still vulnerable she is NOT Wolverine or anything like that she is a person and needs to remember that.
But this theory is not that. This Theory is on how Arya could be queen of the seven kingdoms by the end of the story. Yes i think it is possible after Azor Ahai (Jon, Dany, Jorah, or whoever) saves the world or makes a peace with the white walkers or becoming there night king/queen or something like that Arya may be queen by the end of the story. So what evidence do i have to back myself up and not looking like an idiot OR someone off his meds.

Evidence:

- Firstly some will say ""But Darryl Arya has not background in politics or leading a group"" Well actually not true she was most likely taught some stuff on this back in WF at a young child. Sansa was taught the same so she would too (just not listening to the being a lady part because well she was not that at all). Also when she was in the company of Tywin she most likely overheard things and also may have learned some things from over hearing Tywin.

- Arya has indeed learned that there are Evil men and women out there and as a leader she would be able to know who those people are and strike before they can go red wedding on her.

- Speaking of which Arya as leader can get stuff done she is basically one of those people that has no time for negotiation when there is an enemy she would strike nothing more nothing less.

- it would parallel history as she would be similar to the dorne princess Nymeria.

- It would kindof fit the story. Because out of everyone we think will be king and or queen like Jon or Dany or Tyrion or Sansa or Littlefinger or anybody who has more of a chance. A Little Girl, a Second Daughter, with no claim becomes queen of the new generation in the seven kingdoms.

- Finally In the trailer for the new season we see the sigils of the houses fighting each other and turn into ash. Now you think this may more prefer to littlefinger or the true war coming. First yes and second that does not mean that littlefinger would die before getting his goals perhaps as most of Westeros is in ash from the war (but would still be saved by Azor Ahai of course or by someone else if Azor Ahai is the true bad) Littlefinger would finally have the throne in his grasp only for Arya to slit his throat for betraying his father and Arya would sit on the throne (not to claim just to sit on it to kindof you know take a breather) and then the remaining citizens of KL kneel before her as the new generation to rebuild Westeros will need a ruler and she....Becomes that ruler.

- And yes she is alittle violent but her hand can be someone of a moral compass to help her lead (like Davos or Bran or Tyrion)",6,2,False,self,,,,,

Or Azor Ahai is the true breathe of darkness falling heavy on the world and is the true antagonist of the series. Wall the Prince that Was Promised i think is the Protagonist and hero of the story and the one who will unite men and white walkers against the cold breathe of darkness falling heavy on the world Azor Ahai and his or her dragons. 

Now who do i think Azor Ahai is i think he is either Euron or Daenerys. If you read my thread on why i think Euron is Azor Ahai (two part thread by the way) then you know why i think this. But for Daenerys i think it is possible she could go mad and want to destroy the white walkers not just because obvious reasons but maybe because one of them killed her dragon Drogon (which i may add is the one she has a close relation with) and she wants vengeance but Jon will want to make peace. 

Anyways yes Jon Snow is the Prince that Was Promised and like i said i think both have to have the same requirements so let's began. Jon Snow is the son of ice and fire and has the blood, He was also born under a bleeding star when he was born near the blood covered sword Dawn, Jon was also reborn Admits Smoke and Salt when he was resurrected The salt from the water Mel used to wash his hair and the smoke from the fire that was near him when he resurrected.

Now for the Nissa Nissa there is only one person i can think of that is Jon's Nissa Nissa. Sansa Stark so to recap Jon Snow is the Prince that Was Promised and will sacrifice Sansa to forge his lightbringer (an ice sword) and unite men and white walkers against the true threat Azor Ahai (either Euron or Dany) and his or her dragons.  

EDIT: Also it is possible the salt could be misinterpreted for snow ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

1. we know he's good in a fight
2. he speaks with a northern sounding accent. i know theres a big schism about accents in GOT but he sounds like SmallJon Umber
3. he has a clear disdain for pompousity and anything unnecessary, for example when he was the commander of the city watch
4. he knows how to climb, ie when he was traveling with tyrion and catlyn to the erie tyrion boasts of its impregnability, while responds by saying give me ten men and some climbing spikes
5. he has admitted to having been north of the wall for ""work"". he couldve been lying, or perhaps he couldve been working on a merchant ship NOTW, but i feel like his general demeanor is that of a northerner

so basically, i figure he's either a wildling who got tired of the cold and being shit on by the nights watch, climbed the wall, traveled the world, learned how things really work, and decided to live his life to benefit himself.

So I'm going to throw some major tin foil at you guys and I'm ready for anything and everything to support or deny... Littlefinger is a Faceless Man, or he's working for them.


I may have very well pulled this theory out of my ass, but when I started hunting down my own evidence, as well as evidence across Reddit - I realized that I'm not the only one who thinks this might be true.


Here, I've compiled all of my (very broken) ideas and theories and ""evidence"", directly from my sketchbook. It is disjointed. I have the ideas but I can't piece them together - am I loony, or is something starring us all in the face?? Check it:


** Littlefinger is a Faceless Man (maybe the God of Death himself? - extreme) and the Faceless Men have some greater purpose in relation to the full story (are they siding with the Walkers? Is there a connection here?) 

** Walkers = God of Death??

** Valar Dohaeris = All men must serve. - Wights are servants of the Walkers - dealing out death

** Valar Morghulis - All men must die. - the goal though? - REVENGE for the 1st MEN

** Maybe LF is a servant of the FM - preparing the Realm for death (too much? - evil for evil sake can't be the end game)

** LF has friends and little birds everywhere

** Fast travel - are there multiple LF's? Is he NO ONE? - if No One[s] are using LF's face... when did the real LF die?

** He's been called a ""peddler of flesh"" - if he is a FM, does he use the whore's faces if they die?

** ARYA tells the Hound that she knows a man who could kill him with his little finger. We know that she is talking about Jaquen - will hindsight tell us otherwise?? Play on ""little finger""

- I don't buy LF's story behind his name (S1E? - I was a very small boy from an island called The Fingers... so you see? - said to Ros and foreign whore when they ask about the name)

- Ros later tells someone that he hates being called Littlefinger - why would he hate that name if his story were true about the nickname?

** Is LF then Jaquen? Syrio? All 3? Could they be servants of LFs?

** Will Arya run into him later? Game of Faces training &gt; call him out on a lie &gt; figure it all out? &gt; kill him?

** Joff's death - despite the fact that Olenna helped - poison(the Strangler) - relation to the ""death water"" in the pool at the House of B&amp;W?

** LF could easily be considered the 'first dominoe' in the events we've seen take place in the show - if you go further back it could be argued that the events involving Rhaegar started everything

** Did he do it to distract the Realm from the Great War? (What would be his other purpose?) - his story about him and Sansa on the throne etc could just be another lie/manipulation

** He seems like he knows who Jon really is - and about Rhaegar/Lyanna (based on the look he gives Sansa in the crypts in the scene where she tells him Rhaegar ""abducted and raped her"") - does he intend to undo Jon? Help him? - is his assignment from the FM to assassinate Jon? Has that been his long slow end game instead? - is there even a connection here?

** His ""gifts"" almost always mean death for SOMEONE -he gifted Ros to Joff because he didn't need her, -Olyvar to Cersei to imprision the Tyrells, ultimately leading to the explosion at the Sept, -He gives Lancel to Olenna to imprison Cersei, who died though?, as a result ... Also, Joff's murder was a gift to Olenna to get in good with the Tyrells

** He comes from Braavos - where the FM also hail from

** Mockingbird pin has a sharp edge ... for use with poison?

** Is loving Cat/Sansa just part of the story he's been telling his whole life?

** Greatest player of the Game of Faces? 


That's all I've got ... as you can see, I can't fill all of the holes and my thought process here is very fragmented. Just wanted to get some discussion going. Have at it! :D

It also seems somewhat out of character for him to throw his relations with the Starks, via Sansa, out the window like that. And it's obvious from the way he ended the Battle of the Bastards that he didn't intend her as a bargaining chip to the Boltons.

Did he think Roose, but not Ramsey, could hold the North and would cooperate? Did he think this was the only way to get Jon to attack? Or was this his clever way to sneak an unwitting spy into Winterfell? Whatever the case, it just seems careless of him to use such an important person like that.

Did they fight White Walkers and The Great Other? Or other creatures? Who helped create the five forts? Was it TCoTf?

Did this take place the same time as our long night? Before? After? What do you think?

In theory, for a comparison. Think mirrored story.

Yi Ti = Westeros

Five Forts = The Wall

Lion Of Night = The Great Other or The Night's King

The father is still up to debate, but chances are it's Rhaegar. So what happened there exactly?

If we take Rhaegar as Jon's father, we have 2 options :

1. Lyanna was raped by Rhaegar

Rhaegar was obsessed with the profecy, so it's not unbelievable that he went crazy (like many Targaryens) and just took Lyanna and raped her. Not very romantic, but it saves Lyannas honor.

2. Lyanna did it willingly with Rhaegar

This is the widely accepted theory and also the worse of the two. It puts both characters in a bad light. If this theory turns out to be true then Lyanna is just a bitch. I mean, she wouldn't give it up to Robert before they were married, but she fucks a dude whom she barely knows without blinking an eye? Rhaegar would be no better. He was a married man and slept with an engaged woman, which in turn started a war where so many people died. No honor there on both sides. He surely deserved Robert's hammer. Poor Jon stays a bastard and on top of that a bastard who is also a son of a bitch (and a bitch father).

[*original post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/60kst2/no_spoilers_march_madness_game_of_thrones_style/)

I assumed it's a 1v1 battle like in The Mountain vs The Viper, and every character is at its peak.

Do you agre with my picks? i will defend them!


**First round (difficult picks):**

* **Syrio** vs Bronn: Syrio will beat the Bronn because he's the first sword of Braavos, a city known for great its warriors.

* Rob vs **Tanner**: Rob is a great commander, but his fighting skills a bit worse then Jon's, and Jon lost to Tannar in a dual.
* **Robbert** vs Ygritte: Robbert was a great warrior in his prime, much better then Ygritte.
* **Blackfish** vs Grey Worm: Brandon Tully in his prime is comparable to Jaime, while grey worm isn't even close.
* Stannis vs **Loras**: Stannis is a great commander, not warrior, Loras on the other hand won almost Every tournament until the one with the mountain.
* Thormand vs **Hotah**: Probably the closest dual in this round, but Hotah is the best fighter in Dorn (excluding the Viper), he is comparable to Jamie, and Thormand is just a very good wildling warrior.

**Second round (difficult picks):**

* Jon vs. **Syrio**: Jon is a good leader and a warrior, but Syrio is one of the best swordsman in Westeros, defiting several Kingsguards with a wooden sword.

* **The Hound** vs Daario: The sheer power of The Hound will beat Daario.
* **Selmy** vs Robert: Selmy is probably the best warrior in the seven kingdoms, still being one of the best long after hos prime. Robert was a great warriors but not even close to Selmy.
*  **Jaime** vs Blackfish: Even Jamie feared a dual with Blckfish a long time after his prime, but in the end Jaime is one of the best warriors, while Blackfish isn't (warrior, not commander).
* Loras vs **Ned**: Loras did won a lot of tournament but he never realy thought in a proper war, Ned is one of the best Warrior Robert's rebellion and was able to kill a kingsguard of Reaghar (in TOJ).
* **Drogo** vs Hotah (best dual of the round): The reason that Drogo was the leader of the bigger Khalasar is that he is the best Dosthraki warrior, a force to be reckon with.
* Breinne vs **The Viper**: while Breinne is good, comparable to the mountian, The viper is legendary and could wipe her out like he won vs The Mountain (but wouldn't lose because of other motives).

**Quarterfinals:**

* **Syrio** vs The Hound: We all love The Hound but he isn't even comparable to Syrio. Syrio beat kingsgurnds with a wooden sword and is the first sword of Braavos, The Hound fights with peasants. 

* The Mountain vs **Selmy**: Even the The mountain is an ablsoulot beast he isn't even close to Salmy in his prime, the best kingsgaurd ever (Probably).
* Ned vs **Jaime**: Ned is one of the best warrior of his genertions and could (in S1) keep up with Jaimie but in a daul. But jaime is a Legendery swordsman, obviesly taking the edge (Ned lost his biggest feat of killing ser Arthur Dane in TOJ).
* Drogo vs **The Viper**: Best battle of this round, both the viper and Drogo are ledgens, I would bet the viper but it is very close, and we saw that Dothrakis have difficulty against modern fighting style. (and both of them will win the semis).

**Semifinals:**
duo to the placement we will not have the greatest four in it because Jaime is in instead of Jaime. 

* Syrrio vs **Selmy**: both are legends but still Selmy has the edge as the fighter.

* Jaimie vs **The Viper**: TOTAL ANNIHILATION, The Viper fought in the fighting pits and is a master of dueling while Jaimie's reputation is also based on the faced that he is a Lannister.

**FINALS**: 

* **Selmy** vs The Viper: Selmy is the best knight of the seven kingdoms while the viper is truly a master of fighting, he didn't devote his all life to it.

1594,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-3-21,2017,3,21,23,60nrot,self.gameofthrones,[MAIN SPOILERS] All current alliances known,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/60nrot/main_spoilers_all_current_alliances_known/,derek1st,1490105219,"So as a show only viewer (reading the first book now though), it becomes confusing who all has sided with who. In the books, you easily remember character names etc, but in a show, I often forget who's loyal to who etc. Especially with the weekly release schedule. So as a means of collecting my own thoughts, I'm trying to piece together who all is allied to who at the moment. If you guys could tell me if I have it right or, if not, what I got wrong, that'd be great. 

""Northern Alliance"". At the moment, we have The north. We know that several major houses are allied with the Jon Snow, king of the north. I couldn't tell you which really, its quite obvious in the books I know, but the show goes into far less detail. I know that the karstarks clearly sided with ramsy, and the mormonts with the starks. We also know of a few other houses, but I'll leave it to you to go into it. (what i DON'T know, is after the fall of ramsy, did the remaining houses join the king in the north? or no?) I know there's supposed to be theories that the northern houses that joined ramsy might not have actually been loyal to him, but since thats not in the show, I won't go into it. We also have the Vale, which is notable for a coupel reasons. 1) they have the freshest army in the seven kingdoms at the moment. Almost everyone's armies are dwindling because of the war of 5 kings (stannis lost his army, the lannister army had battled rob, the freys have been tied up against the blackfish, dorns numbers dwindled etc etc) but the vale is a major house, that isn't split or anything, and has stayed out of the fight so far. Thats probably the northern alliances greatest asset, however, they're under the unreliable little finger. While we can speculate that either he will betray the north, or sansa will betray him and reveal that he killed lysa, but for now we'll include them in the starks northern alliance. The nights watch isn't allied with any house and only focuses on fighting the others (white walkers), however, jon is one of the few people who are actually concerned with fighting the undead army, so at least in THAT scope they're united. Not necessarily in the bid for the iron throne, but in other respects there's, well, not an ""alliance"" but an ""understanding"". 

Ok next there's the people loyal to the crown. The lannisters still have their ""army"" of paid soldiers, however I can't speak to their strength at the moment. We know at the very least they have 8000 men when they came up to the twins to help walder frey. We know that the freys now hold the riverlands. Edmure is still under the lannisters thumb. Now, in light of walder frey's murder, its unknown if edmure will try to rise up as the new lord of the riverlands again and fight back agaisnt the lannisters or if he'll roll over. Tentatively, i'll put the riverlands in the lannisters camp. Is storms end still a thing? or did they all die with either remly or stannis. I don't know if they back anyone, but i doubt its the crown. I think thats all at the moment, just the riverlands and westerlands. Correct me if i'm missing anyone. 

Dorn hates the lannisters, however their forces never seemed too great. Maybe the show just undersells them, but i've never seen anything resembling an army. But the tyrells are now united with dorn for danny. The tyrells to my knowledge still have condisderable money and manpower. Danny also has the unsullied army and the second sons. I don't know what their current numbers are though, how many did she lose in murreen. Also did she pick up any other fighters? Did any of the locals join her? We know she also has 2 of the greyjoys, but i don't know what all that ammounts to. did they bring any men? surely they had to bring some, they can't drive a ship by themselves i don't think. She also has the dothraki. not a single kalisar, but from what i can tell, ALL of them. Which is huge. 

Then theres the rest of the greyjoys. They dont' seem too powerful, except they can make ships better than anyone. So it remains to be seen how they move. 

Then of course there's the undead army. 

i think those are all the major factions currently. Who's the most powerful? My money's obviously on danny, but with the addition of the vale, the northern alliance seems powerful assuming they don't get backstabbed by little finger. 

That reminds me, why didn't the vale help the starks against he lannisters? did lysa refuse them? I can't remember.

(If not Dragonstone, then Dorne.) Early on the main conflict will be an impending naval battle between the fleets of Dany vs Euron Greyjoy. Euron and Cersei will have an alliance. Before they battle, Jorah Mormont will return amongst them. 

Also, In the North, Paeter Baelish will be a main plot mover and get a lot of spotlight and have a lot of conflict along with Sansa and Jon. Bran will get a lot more screen time and we might even get to see Rhaeger or more of Arys II in flashbacks and definitely more of the Night King. Before his main battle, Euron will test his strength, likely against the North where Davos Seaworth will play a major role in saving them. Arya will run into Melissandre and the Hound early on and possibly even Barrick Dondarian or even Gendry. And Nymeria. There will also be conflict with Cersei and Jaime. 

I imagine screen time to be about evenly divided by 3 main plots (Jon/Dany/Cersei) with Kings Landing especially getting a lot of exciting drama early on. I expect the main subplots to be Arya hearing about Azor Ahai, Bran attempting to tell Jon about his lineage, and Sam finding out some way to aid in the Great War. Possibly how to craft Valyrian steel. Also Theon will have some redemption arc probably during the naval battle and a chance of dying. The Dothraki horde will be taken out sometime before she reaches Westeros but after they are given one useful thing to do. 

The big battle at the end of season is the sack of kings landing part 2 involving lots of Dragon bad-assery, Cersei doing something completely mad, Tyrion using some inside knowledge to save the day from some trap (with a Davos parallel), and likely a Grey Worm or someone similar (Jorah?) fights The Mountain. And in the end Jaime will kill Cersei. Wildfire will likely be involved. And Dany at some point has a huge moral decision, and I think shell unexpectedly make the good choice. Either late in the season (but probably early in the last season) Tyrion will be the link that creates the Dany Jon alliance. 

A lot of loose ends and plot threads will get tied up in the last 2 episodes, little finger will make some grand play or a big steps towards his final play, and then in the finale the wall comes crashing down (most likely due to Bran) with Jon still not knowing his parentage. There'll be a Littlefinger/Varys parallel too and we'll likely find out (more) about the sorcerer. And maybe MAYBE they will finally unleash the hidden plot lines of the Iron Bank and/or the Faceless Men and what exactly their deal is. The roles of the Queen of Thrones and the Ellya Martel will be minimal. A dragon will die. Wouldn't it be crazy if Jorah and Lynna run into each other (dont think thats going to happen). Same with Clegannebowl. Jaime will be the emotional centerfold of the season. By the end of the season Kings Landing is completely destroyed and the last shot we get relates to the Night King. Hopefully his castle. And hopefully we don't lose any Starks this season. 

That was really long but does that not all make a lot of sense?",15,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Would this somehow benefit Littlefinger? Jon has his own adviser in Davos and with everything that happened with Sansa, I believe Sansa's words from ""Winds of Winter"" --- ""Only a fool would trust Littlefinger."" I believe he wouldn't benefit from it, so wouldn't it make more sense for him to try and put it to a stop? Dany has the backing of the Martell's (Sand Snakes), Tyrell's (Poor Olenna), young Greyjoy's, Tyrion, Varys, Dothraki, and those she left in Essos. Jon has the North and possibly Riverrun with the help of Sansa. The joining of their houses would get in the way of his ultimate goal. He would benefit from outing them, if that would keep them from marrying. I don't think Dany and Jon would hold the same beliefs as previous Targaryen's. Just a thought.

For instance, despite the fact that his death came about as the result of a conspiracy between multiple parties, Robb Stark's 'killer' would be Roose Bolton, as it was he who dealt the fatal blow.

Some cases, admittedly, are a bit trickier, because there are cases where one character *caused* a killing by less direct means. But as for a more complicated example, let's consider Melisandre to be Shireen Baratheon's killer, as it was she who lit the pyre on which she was sacrificed. Trickier still might be the case of Ramsay Bolton; while it's clear that Sansa *orchestrated* the hounds that killed him to be released into the area where he was confined at that moment, it's not clear that she directly triggered said release. (Unlike when Ramsay used a similar tactic to lead Walda Frey-Bolton and her newborn baby into the kennels, trapped them inside, then whistled to command the hounds to attack them).

I feel pretty confident now about how season 7 is going to start:

GoT is all about alliances and political maneuvering, that's been the backbone of the story for 6 seasons, which is then filled in with the blood, sex, and scheming we seem to like so much.  So what are the natural political responses to the sudden shifts at the end of season 7?  We have Cersei in Kings Landing, Euron leading the Iron Born, Tyrells/Dorne joining together and joining with Dany's alliance, Littlefinger doing his thing and we have Jon Snow's North. Seems natural that the Tyrell/Dorne/Dany/Jon alliance will occur when Dany lands, especially given what we know of Jon's heritage now.

So that leaves Cersei and Euron, who likely has heard or will hear of Dany's alliance with Yara/Theon.  So how does Euron respond?  By trying to ally with Cersei of course, and since they're both unmarried, it seems like a marriage alliance is the simplest response.  They're both ruthless, political, and dumb enough to think they each need what the other has.  

This brings into the picture the two biggest question marks of all.  What does Jamie do with this new maneuver and how does Littlefinger try to gain from the duality that is being created in Westeros?  That'll be the story of season 7 in my mind.  Does Jamie fight Euron, does he kill Cersei when she accepts Euron, does he join Dany when he finds out Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen?  And what does Littlefinger do with the Vale, considering they raised their swords for Jon too?   This is your story of Season 7.  The Night King will be the background noise that leads into Season 8 and the final showdown of living and the dead. But before that, two sides will go to war in Westeros and knowing GRRM, seems just as likely that one side wins as the other.",32,16,False,self,,,,,

As everyone who has caught up with the series knows, Hodor meets his end at the end at the end of this episode, however, his body isn't burned. With seasons 7 and 8 on the way, and knowing how our GoT creators love to wreak havoc on our emotions, I realized that Hodor is probably going to return as a giant, powerful wight. So, my question to you guys is, how exactly do you think this will play out? Personally, I believe that Hodor, as an undead warrior, will at least reencounter Bran, but he might also run into Sansa and Jon as well, which will most likely not go down well for anyone. I especially like to imagine that somehow either the Mountain will travel up north or Hodor will make it down south and the two will have some sort of undead monster battle.

Jon Snow will decide enough is enough and will go to make peace with the white walker with Bran coming with him.

But i am here to remove the confusion on that of course Jon's story last season was about his death not of himself but of his spirit after he was brought back he did change. He lost hope, That will to fight, the feeling that all will be good (which is of course something all the fanboys did not see because apparently we all look at the wrong stuff). But in the moment as the bodies were on him in the Battle of the Bastards he decided to get his way out of that pile of bodies and live on.
Kit Harington said himself ""When the crush starts happening he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks 'I could just stay here and let it all end.' ""And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again""
So what exactly drove Jon to get up to grasp breath to keep fighting. Vengeance on Ramsay, Getting his home back, Love for his family. Most likely all three but i think there is a fourth reason....what if it was his love for Sansa that drove him to be reborn again now is it family love....Yeah probably but sense we all love to theorize and also i am starting to follow JONSA it may be alittle more then that so let's get started. Also we will look at how she will be Jon's Nissa Nissa or Night queen if peace is made with the others.

- First up when Jon gets the Pink Letter...Get it. That Rickon is in Ramsay's he at first does not want to go because he is not convinced but is convinced by Sansa. Jon did not for just love of his family but he saw something in Sansa. Something he never saw before.

- If you think about it the only reason Jon is going to war with Ramsay is for Sansa. Yes i think it did start as family love but i think it has grown into a forbidden love and that what made him choose to fight Ramsay and save Rickon.

- Finally When he is driving himself to get a breath in that giant ball (i can't think of a better term) of bodies he is not only fighting for his home but also his love. Sansa Stark and is why when he was beating Ramsay he stopped because it was Sansa's fight.

- Okay so let's get to Azor Ahai. I think it is safe to say if Jon loves Sansa more then just family she will be his Nissa Nissa and Jon will have to sacrifice her to forge lightbringer.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

While watching s2 ep8 when tywin is talking to his army leaders he mentions both his enemies, first is stannis then he says something along the lines of the wolf and jerks his head in arya's direction while she had her back to him. 

It's and extremely quick head motion that you may not notice. I don't know of the writers or director wanted him to do it or Charles Dance did it subconsciously and they went with it. But i just can't see D&amp;D letting that in of it wasn't intentional.

SAM: Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run. 

OLLY: You believe that? 

SAM: With all my heart. 

It seems that Olly was battling internally about whether to betray Jon. Sam's quote, defending Jon, actually solidified Olly's decision to conspire with Thorne.

1901,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-3-26,2017,3,26,3,61gz1m,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] Jaime Locke scene analysis.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/61gz1m/everything_jaime_locke_scene_analysis/,HEV_tux,1490465988,"I wanted to talk about the scene at the bear pit. Most people find this scene noteworthy because it is a big part of Jaimes transformation and it develops his relationship with Brienne. This is all well and good, but I think it causes many to overlook another very interesting aspect of the scene that highlights this storys masterful use of symbolism and subtlety.      

Before taking Jaimes hand, Locke gives him a speech about how his fathers name isnt going to save him the way it does in the rest of the world. At the bear pit, Jaime literally says his fathers name, and implies the influence he has over Lockes own lord (Roose), and refers to Locke as a pet rat causing Lockes own countrymen to essentially side with Jaime. The scene almost entirely contradicts Lockes speech from before. (note that just as locke yields, the bear lets out a frustrated growl in the background).     

Additionally, lets take a look at Bolton culture. We know from Ramsay and the others that torture and psychological domination are a huge part of what Boltons do. They like to control people through fear. Locke took Jaimes hand because he knew it gave him his legendary status. Locke wanted Jaime to fear him at the existential level, he drills this point home with continuous insults for the rest of their time together. Jaime never really shows the kind of fear Locke wants out of him (as we saw from being a prisoner of Robb Jaime is a hard minded SOB), and the scene at the bear pit drives this home. 
Given Jaimes importance, to Rooses new political relationship, he could have even gone as far as to order Lockes own men to kill him, but instead he casually says: well, we will be on our way and pulls the smartass line sorry about the sapphires. He is also looking down at Locke the entire time, while during the maim scene, Jaime is either limping beneath him of kneeling over the table while Locke towers above him. What would have really sealed this scene is if Jaime tapped Locke on the cheek with his remaining hand.       


The entire interaction basically communicates to Locke You may be able to use a hatchet, but you are still completely insignificant to me and not worth my time, not even worth revenge. From a Boltons perspective that is a huge kick in the balls in front of his own men.     

Anyway all thoughts and observations are appreciated, I might make a video on this if people like it enough.

I moved back in Feb and did not have internet for about 2 weeks so I bought Season 1 on blu ray and got started... and could not stop... I watched seasons 1-6 continuously so I have no particular nostalgia for the early seasons. So here is my ranking. I might watch the entire series again before season 7 (I ended up buying all of them on PSN).

1. Season 4 - So much happened in this season, a lot moving pieces and drastic changes. Loved every second of it. Oh ya, and the battle at the wall, so epic... 
2. Season 2 - This is the season that really got me hooked. Rob was a badass, Tyrean was a badass, Danny was starting to come into her own, battle of blackwater.... 
3. Season 6 - Just finished it 30 min ago. Wow. On second play through might move up higher. The finale was by far the best in the series.
4. Season 3 - Red wedding, Knights of the Watch finally doing something, great season, just not as good as the ones above
5. Season 1 - 1st half was kinda slow, maybe has the best acting in the series, you can tell budget was a tad lower 1st season before HBO knew what a hit they had on their hands
6. Season 5 - Season 5 is last because it just feels to drag a lot, their are high points (like the White walker army fighting the wildlings) but I really did not like Aria's storyline in this season, it is finally paying off late in season 6, but it was definitely the low point in the series for me (the entire time she was ""training"" for the faceless god stuff).

Gods purposes were usually mysterious, but this scourge had been too terrible to be accepted without questioning. If a disaster of such magnitude, the most lethal ever known, was a mere wanton act of God or perhaps not Gods work at all, then the absolutes of a fixed order were loosed from their moorings. Minds that opened to admit these questions could never again be shut.

The details of which include:

&gt;**A grey girl on a dying horse, travelling in haste, along the western shore of a gigantic lake. In a surrounding area of Hills, Trees, Streams, Fields, and Stones. The girl is avoiding villages that are also in the area.**

A girl does arrive at the Wall and it is believed that Mels vision was wrong. Alys Karstark  is the grey girl travelling along the western shore of Long Lake heading to the Wall for Jons protection from her unwanted marriage.

Alys is a red herring though.



#IS THE GIRL EVEN HEADING NORTH?

Mel admits only to herself that she has no clue when this moment happens or where this girl really is. **So how can she know the girl is heading North?** Mance only suggests Long Lake because Mel tells him the girl is coming to the Wall. There is nothing in the vision to suggest that's her goal. Mel has no idea where this girl actually is. 

*Mance thinks the girl is clever for avoiding the dangerous King's Road.

Early on Arya learns this lesson from Yoren:

&gt;""We're not far from Gods Eye,"" the black brother said one morning. **""The kingsroad won't be safe till we're across the Trident.** So we'll come up around the lake along the western shore, they're not like to look for us there.""  - Arya, ACoK

Arya ends up doing just that as she leads Gendry and Hotpie. She then travels with the The Hound and has this same lesson drilled into her later on. The two eventually cross the Trident together. 

*Mel says the girl is avoiding villages.

&gt;So she stayed with the Hound.

&gt;They rode every day, never sleeping twice in the same place, avoiding towns and villages and castles as best they could.  Arya, ASoS



#THE GODS EYE LAKE

Situated near Harrenhal, I propose this is the Lake Mel saw in her vision:

&gt;Every day they marched, and every night she said her names, until finally the **trees** thinned and gave way to a patchwork landscape of rolling **hills**, meandering streams, and sunlit **fields**, where the husks of burnt **holdfasts (villages)** thrust up black as rotten teeth. It was another long day's march before they glimpsed the towers of Harrenhal in the distance, **hard beside the blue waters of the lake.**  Arya, ACoK

~*~

&gt;The setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of beaten copper. **It was the biggest lake she had ever seen, with no hint of a far shore.**  ARYA IV, A CLASH OF KINGS

~*~

&gt;**To the east, Gods Eye was a sheet of sun-hammered blue that filled half the world.** Some days, as they made their slow way up the muddy shore (Gendry wanted no part of any roads, and even Hot Pie and Lommy saw the sense in that), **Arya felt as though the lake were calling her.** She wanted to leap into those placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun.  ARYA V, ACoK

&gt;And what else do you know?"" It is snowing in the riverlands, in Westeros, she almost said. But he would have asked her how she knew that, and she did not think that he would like her answer. - The Blind Girl, ADwD


Mel describes the surroundings of this grey girl and they fit the area around the God's Eye lake.

Recall Mel's description:

&gt; **Hills. Fields. Trees. A deer, once. Stones. She is staying well away from villages. When she can she rides along the bed of little streams, to throw hunters off her trail.** - Mel

Remember Arya's chase on horseback and the terrain George describes after she becomes a captive and tries to escape:

&gt;""Why do I have to see Lord Beric?"" she asked quietly.

&gt;""We bring him all our highborn captives,"" said Anguy.

&gt;Captive. Arya took a breath to still her soul. Calm as still water. She glanced at the outlaws on their horses, and turned her horse's head. Now, quick as a snake, she thought, as she slammed her heels into the courser's flank. Right between Greenbeard and Jack-Be-Lucky she flew, and caught one glimpse of Gendry's startled face as his mare moved out of her way. And then she was in the open field, and running.

&gt;North or south, east or west, that made no matter now.

Made no matter indeed! The passage is quite long but Arya races over Hills, trees, fields, and stones in the area near Gods Eye.

If the Lake in the vision is the Gods Eye, then that really narrows things down: Jeyne wouldn't be riding alone anywhere that South. Alys is the obvious red herring.

Why is the Gods Eye lake important? The sacred order of the Green Men and the CoTF most holy place is the **Isle of Faces** which is located at the center of the God's Eye lake.

&gt;In the south, the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. - Catalyn, AGoT

&gt;""Finally, the wise of both races prevailed, and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called Gods Eye. - Bran, AGoT

Then there is this:

&gt;""**No one** visits the Isle of Faces. objected Bran. That's where the green men live."" - Bran, ASoS

...

&gt;**Arya felt as though the (Gods Eye) lake were calling her.** She wanted to leap into those placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun. But she dare not take off her clothes where the others could see...

&gt;From up here, **she could see a small wooded island off to the northeast. (The Isle of Faces)** Thirty yards from shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so serene . . . no one had told them that war had come, and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men. She stared at them with yearning. Part of her wanted to be a swan the other part wanted to eat one. - (Arya, A Clash of Kings)


What are the chances that the grey girl in Mel's vision is Arya, at a future point returned to Westeros, travelling south along the western shore of the Gods Eye lake possibly heading somewhere important like the Isle of Faces?

George was asked about the Green Men:

&gt;**GRRM: The green men and the Isle of Faces will come to the fore in later books. (Boy, it's tough to sneak anything by you guys.)**

While travelling with the Hound near the Trident, **Arya marks 4 trees with her name and prays for a Red priest to find her in their flames.** Mel desperately was trying. Perhaps she has succeeded, *(but got the place and time completely wrong?** She often misinterprets things. 
The grey girl (Stark) travelling on a dying horse (signifying a long journey or a quick escape leading to a wounded horse) heading South along the Gods Eye, not Long Lake in the North as Mel wanted to believe was true so she can win Jons trust.

We've seen the Lord of Light answer the prayers of Melisandre and Thoros of Myr, establishing credence to the teachings of the Red Faith.  Alternatively, we've also seen the power of the weirwood  trees and the Three-Eyed Raven,  equally demonstrating the (potential) existence of the old God's. 

Additionally, with the clear evidence of the mystical powers wielded by the Faceless Men, perhaps J.H. is actually the Many Faced God. Besides the Waif, we've not seen any other Faceless Men. Is it a cadre of followers? A legion? An Army? There's no clear evidence either way, as of yet. 

Note: Obviously, I'm referring to the show alone, since J. H. was not a party to Arya's official training in Braavos. ",212,1231,False,spoiler,,,,,

They retain the social positions, birth orders and so on of the character, but they simply act in the way another character would act.  
For simplicity sake, lets refer to a character by the personality not the position.  
For example: Let shuffle Arya, Sansa and Daenerys's personalities.  
Now Daenerys is eldest daughter of the Starks, Sansa is the younger, Arya is a Targaryen and in exile across the narrow sea.  
What happens?  

In this example: Arya was always tomboyish, so I think she would take to learning archery first from the Dothraki, this might earn Drogo's favor in a different way then Daenerys's seeing her as a warrior and instructing her in he way of the arakhs, for her first kill she face stabs Vaserys, she rides the Dothraki sea as a warrior queen until Drogo dies... possibly in roughly the same manner as he did in the prime reality, but more interestingly, in a duel with Arya over a perceived slight to his authority. A pyre later and she's got dragons, some walking later and she learns the way of the westerosi knight from Selmy, a demonstration of the use of air power later, she's learning the fighting style of the Unsullied and so on. So in this reality Arya is more of the  face bash type of ultimate warrior, rather than the sneaky stabby kind of ultimate warrior.  
  
Daenerys is betrothed to Jeoffrey. She is rapidly disabused of any notion of Jeoffrey being noble, but does something about it. It's a tug of war between Her and Cersei for Jeoff, but the Queen has entrenched position and more starting political capital, Robert dies, Ned is killed in a target strike from the Queen. Dany is still building favor with the Jeoff, Cersei enters into a tacit alliance with Margaery. It still isn't enough, Dany has been building favor with both the King and has been starting with the other lords. Robb is dead, it's against Jeoff's will but Maragery is now to be Queen. Tyrion is forced to marry her. Tyrion sees potential and his own declining position in the family, they forge a platonic alliance. With the two of them doing a good cop/bad cop on Jeoff he is almost completely turned. Cersei is beginning to see the Jeoff is now completely lost. She poisons him and pins the blame on Tyrion and Danerys. Jamie and Little Finger spring the two of them, they escape north to rally the Stark armies.  
So in this reality, Daenrys is fighting against specific opponents using manipulations rather than fighting against socio/economic forces. It's arguable which one is harder, on the one hand she has people specifically targeting her and actively countering her moves, on the case she is attempting to undo civilization underpinnings in a system too big to care about her.

Starks do know as well. Maester aemon is also aware that the upcoming winter will last longer.

According to recorded historical evidences. The long night occurred roughly around 6-8000 yrs ago.

No information or evidence suggests if a long night occured before its first recorded occurence.
Assuming that this upcoming/just started unnatural winter is its 2nd occurence and there is a 6-8k cycle

The 1st Long winter is affiliated with Unknown beings called Others and according to Bran Stark's vision, he saw that this beings are created by The Children of the forest as a detterent against the First men, but their creation defied subjugation and gone rogue, and eventually become an all life extinction level threat. This threat not just happened exclusively in westeros but in essos as well(historical evidence states that the rhoyne river froze and the same beings is spotted in Yi Ti up to further east) which suggest that this two continents are connected somehow or this beings, made their own ice bridge.

With this limited evidences I concluded with several hypothesis.

1. If Long Night is a natural cycle of season, and if this season is a recipe to create the Others.

This explains why some people know  when will the long winter may occur.

2. If creating the Others cause the Long night.

This doesn't explain why some people know when will the event may occur.

Maybe by gut feel or instinct but highly unlikely.
Maybe by premonition, vision, or the escalation of magic

Another theory of mine is that The Children did not cast a spell to submerge or flood the arm of dorne and other lands across the world.

All of the Ice made by the Others melted after their defeat causing increase in water level sinking the arm of dorne and other lands across the world like the swamps and marshes in the neck, the thousand island in essos, bassilisk isles and many more.

This explains why the children just dont use a flood spell to eliminate the First men in the first place.

If this theory is correct, then the chronological order of events is something like this.

1. Migration of the First men
2. The war of the First men and the Children
3. The long night
4. Arrival of the Hero
5. The Pact of the Isle of the Faces
6. Battle for the Dawn
7. (Hammer of the waters) but just the melting of the Ice instead.

In the show, we already saw Cersei ignite the Wildfire beneath Baelors Sept. We also saw a burned throne room w/ snow falling during Dany's House of the Undying Vison (show).

Is it possible that the White Walkers and the Wights overpower the North, thus driving everyone South? If this is the case, what better trap than to have all the WW's and Wights together in Kings Landing and to ignite all the Wildfire caches w/ Dragon fire? This would most likely destroy ALL Wights and most/all WW's in one gigantic explosion. This would fulfill Dany's vision of a burned throne room with snow falling, b/c technically Winter would have come.

I've also seen posts about 3ER being the driving force behind King Aerys' madness by whispering to him. Maybe the ""Burn them all"" outbursts is actually for the White Walkers/Wights amidst his madness.

I feel as though this hatred (despite some touching moments between the two when Jon was young) caused some problems in Jon, including him not really feeling like a family member to the Starks, and feeling like an outsider. I think this quote from the first book summarizes this well: ""Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father's sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn Stark had seen to that.""

So, how do you think Jon and Catelyn's relationship would differ if Ned told her the truth (that Jon was Lyanna and Rhaegar's son) when he brought him to Winterfell? I think this would have been a better idea, rather than claiming Jon as his own.

Also, would this have led to Jon not joining the Night's Watch, due to being more loved and accepted by his family?",9,5,False,self,,,,,

Now let's start with the most obvious fact Daario has Brown hair in the show yes he dyed his hair in the books but we can assume it is the same as it is in the show. starks are known for having brown hair and Ashara had black hair and if i use the calculator for finding out hair color we calculate the grandfather with brown hair and father with brown. Now for this i'll assume Ashara's grandmother is black hair and she has black hair and the results are a 50/50 chance of the child having brown or black hair so we can assume it could go either way in this case brown hair. also Daario has a very mysterious past like in the show it is said he is the son of a prostitute though this was said for Gendry in the show and he may be the true son of Robert and Cersei atleast in the show. So maybe they could've made up Daario's backstory telling him as a young boy that his mother was a prostitute when in reality he is Ashara Dayne's son. Finally it is said one of the stark brothers slept with Ashara at the tourney there is no way a child could not have been consevied if this is true   ,4,0,False,self,,,,,

Why?  I think that the only reason we didn't hear something is because they want us to assume Jon is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar without saying it.  It is possible that Lyanna told Ned ""He's Robert's son.""  Jon has the black hair of a Baratheon, and if he is Robert's son, then Jon is the rightful ruler to the Seven Kingdoms because he is not a bastard (Robert was betrothed to Lyanna). 

I could see Game of Thrones surprising us all and having this be true, and then having Cersei's forces kill Dany, because no one sees that coming.  Trust me, I DO NOT WANT DANY TO DIE, but this is a possibility.  Then, Bran could tell Jon he has a claim to the throne and he would fight to be King because he needs all Seven Kingdoms unified against the White Walkers.

But then again, this story line could be to much like The War of Five Kings, which we don't have time for because of the war with the dead.  I hope Dany doesn't die, and this is just a thought.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm still reading the books so that might change my mind. First I will say Jon Snow learns his true lineage and gets with the mother of dragons. All is conquered including the white walkers and it's a fairytale ending to a song of ice and fire. Or (I like this one better) Jon and many others help defeat the army of the undead and the white walkers, but the last white walker turns Jon Snow and he then goes to sleep for 1,000 years north of the wall to return once the men of westeros forget.
I know the children of the forest made them originaly and the walkers only raise the dead, not make more walkers, but it would be really cool if the king of the white walkers could sacrifice himself to turn the person he's fighting into a white walker.

A lot of names have been thrown around but in my opinion, Lyanna either says ""Aegon"" or (POSSIBLY) she says ""Azor Ahai"". From watching this scene numerous times I think she says something extremely similar to either of these two names. 

If it transpires that Jon's true name is Aegon Targaryen (assuming Rhaegar and Lyanna married), I have a question about this. I know the story of Rhaegar being married to Elia Martell, and having two children who were murdered by he mountain ; Rhaenys and Aegon. Alot of people have an issue with Jon being called Aegon as it just wouldn't make sense as Rhaegar already had a son with Elia with the same name. However , (as someone who hasn't read the books) I cannot seem to recall hearing the story of Rhaegar and Elia having children. Does anyone have any evidence of this? I'm not saying that it was't discussed in the show, I'm just struggling to find evidence. If it hasn't been mentioned in the show (which tends to deviate from the book plot), then are we to assume it didn't happen?   Could it be possible the show has completely done away with this story and thus Rhaegar named his son Aegon (Jon). And if this is all mentioned in the show, first of all SOZ and second of all is there any way that Jon being named Aegon COULD work even if Rhaegar had named another child the same?

Thanks. ",31,3,False,self,,,,,

So.. Two counter acting in nature magic induced blood and in high purity runs through Jon Snow and somehow the first time this mixture happened.

Now i would like to see Aegon's conquest the most out of the three but there is another spin-off i would also like to see them do and that is the future as in after the main series. Now you will probably dislike this thinking i am crazy but hear me out. 

I think it would be interesting to see what happens after the main series and i know how they could do it perhaps in one of three ways.

1. The first is a Arya Stark sequel spin-off if she lives past season 7. Now this would be interesting to do because her future was forshadowed alittle one of the possibilities is her going across to lands more west maybe it can be like that and be alittle like Logan in the sense it's tone is like a western or something i think it would be interesting. Only if she lives past S7 and i do not think she will so let's look at the other two possibilities.

2. One set 100 years or atleast a few years after the main series. We can keep medieval this way and on top of that we can focus on the children or great grandchildren of the character we know and love like maybe we meet the child of Arya and Gendry if that happens (or great grandchild) or maybe Jon and Sansa's kids or great grand kids. Only problem is that it seems like the actors and actresses from the main series may move on to other bigger things so maybe the great grand children will do but wait till you hear my third and most fav idea.

3. one set further into the future and i mean Modern Day like there modern day with guns, Modern Day politics, Democracy, The original KL in ruins or as a Parliament of sorts. I think this would be the most interesting one to do as we can see how much this world has changed is it like ours? do white walkers and dragons still exist? Is house Stark and Jon Snow considered a myth? so many possibilities. ",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been debating for some time now whether or not I should tell her about R+L=J (after we watch the episode where Jon is resurrected of course). I know she doesn't know about the theory yet and I definitely don't want to spoil the show for her, but I was reading a post the other day and people said that a lot of people who watched S06E10 didn't understand that R+L=J was confirmed at the end (tbh, I didn't understand it until my friend told me about the confirmed theory afterward, so the reveal didn't really have an impact on me).

I just want my girlfriend to have the best experience watching GoT and I want her to experience the shock value minus the confusion. I don't think she will completely understand the R+L=J scene in S06E10 because it was pretty ambiguous if you don't know about the theory. When Petyr was talking to Sansa about how Rhaegar was in love with Lyanna in an earlier season, I kind of re-explained to my girlfriend that that's what sort of sparked Robert's Rebellion, but I think she's forgotten about that by now. Should I show her Alt Shift X's video on R+L=J?

Throughout all of the ASOIAF books so far, the only recurring POV character who has truly died is Ned Stark. Taking into account Catelyn's transformation into Lady Stoneheart, every other POV character has survived all five books, although characters around them who were never given the POV treatment have died frequently. This list includes Bran, Catelyn, Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Tyrion, Sansa, Davos, Theon, Jaime, Samwell, Cersei, Brienne and Melisandre.

I feel like George R.R. Martin did this to emphasize the importance of Ned Stark's death. His death set off a wild chain of events that has shaped the story throughout ASOIAF, and therefore he is the only POV character whose death is as important as the lives and activities of all of the other POV characters.

My question for you guys: Do you think that this trend will continue until the epic finale of the series? It seems fitting to have Ned continue to be the sole POV death until the books are coming to a close (and after that, anything could happen). I can't see any of the characters in that list being killed off before the end of the series because their stories all seem to be building toward something greater. I think it's more likely that they will all survive until the very end, at which point all of their stories will intertwine in the payoff readers have been waiting years for. So, what do you guys think?",26,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

I don't have a ton of hard evidence, but let me list my reasons as to why I believe this..

The prophecy states that the hero will be ""Born again amidst salt and smoke"", and many signs also point to Dragonstone, from what I've read from other theories.
I belive Davos' near-death experience at the Battle of the Blackwater, going into the sea amidst the wildfire, would be his rebirth of sorts..he almost dies then and there, loses 4 of his 5 sons, and his pouch with his finger bones (which I believe could be more significant than it seems), and ends up shipwrecked, almost loses his mind, and wishing for death to come. To me, it's less in your face than say, Dany's emergence from the ashes with dragons, or Jon Snow being brought back from the dead, but it seems more likely to me for this reason..GRRM isn't an ""In your face"" kind of guy, for the most part..

Davos is simply one of the most righteous and honorable characters in the show. He is a good-hearted man, and more pure than most in the world..a simple detail, but important, if you ask me..

Being based in Dragonstone from the start of the books, I believe this may be an important detail, if Dragonstone is indeed an important part in the prophecy...(sorry for my somewhat limited knowledge with previous theories and such)

In the books, Davos is the one who hears the story of Azor Ahai told in detail, which I believe could be a sign...although I know I may be reaching, I think all of these details combined could add up

Davos is the last one to leave the room before Jon Snow rises from the dead..he is also the one who asks Melissandre to try to bring him back. During her attempts, there is no result, and it takes a while for him to finally come back as we all know. This could mean nothing and just be for dramatic effect, but I believe it could be significant that Davos was the one to ask for it to happen, and is also the last to leave the room prior to Jon's return.

Lastly, I think Davos' pure distrust and waryness toward the Lord of Light would just make him an even more poetic choice
, the reluctant, doubtful savior..it seems like a great twist to me.

I know these all seem like small details or like I may be reaching, but I think they do add up to make a pretty solid theory..what do you guys think!? feel free to add to the theory with any evidence of your own, or reasons as to why this could be totally wrong! I just like talking about theories and such, and this is the first one I've sort of developed on my own.

Anyone who has something to add please let me know, thanks!

Back in ancient Westeros it was just magic stuff like children of the forest and animals basically. No one knows where the First Men came from other than that they came through an old land bridge on Dorne and went all the way north. Once they started taking stuff over and building everywhere the children of the forest created the white walkers to fight them off. Later on the Andals came to Westeros from a region in Esso called Andalos (near what is now Pentos). They brought chivalry and basically feudalism to Westeros. The Andal kings ran the South and the First Men in the North until Aegon Targaryen decided he wanted to take his House from Valyria (the ancient city where Jorah got greyscale) and go conquer Westeros with his dragons. Now the Targaryens were probably the weakest of dragon riding houses in Valyria which was the most advanced city in the history of this whole world. Some time after Aegon left to conquer Westeros some cataclysmic event competely destroyed the city killing everyone and leaving the ruined city of Valyria that you've seen. Now the Targs are the only Dragon family. Aegon easily conquers all of Westeros wiping out most of the Andals with his dragons. The Targaryens now rule Westeros completely and it stays like that until Robert Baratheon, Ned Stark, and Tywin Lannister over throw the Mad King and Jamie Lannister kills him. And now here we are.

For me:     

Best:     
----Jaime vs Ned: While I don't like the fact that it implies Ned could somehow hold a candle to Jaime in a one  on one fight, scene is just too good. It's a shame Nickolaj (Jaime's actor) got so few scenes with a sword because he handles a sword better than anyone in the show other than maybe syrio. I really get the sense watching this that Jaime is fast, battle hardened tactical master with a sword, Sean Bean is good as well, it never gets old.    

----Jaime vs Brienne    
Again seeing Jaime fight is great, and while some people dislike it for not explicitl stating that Jaime only lost because of his condition, it is implied very well through the scene. Jaime talks about being exhausted to distract her and get her sword. She is visibly worried and plays defensive at first, he has the upper hand on her and he tries to shoulder bash her which backfires as she has armor, then she hits him with her armor. With each engagement he becomes visibly more exhausted and she realizes she can wait while he tires out.     
    
----The hound vs ""the chickens""      
In addition to having a great leadup scene, this fight illustrates better than any other fight the hounds capabilities. Relentlessly brutal, massive in size, physically strong even when drunk and hungry, and top notch with a sword. He also takes a lot of hard hits and still wins, demonstrating his tankiness.     

----The viper vs The Mountain
I thought Oberyn's actor in the show was handled a bit cheesily (where is the hair?) but the fight scene was fantastic. A fast agile staff wielder vs a massive sword wielder, and it was hard to tell who was going to win. The mountain gets a few solid hits in, the viper gets a few, and eventually you think the little guy has one until, well....     
    
Jorah vs the Qotho
""no further horselord"" is a badass quote to begin with. The resulting battle is fascinating because it reflects the explanation Jorah gave earlier that season about the advantage of armor, and it also demonstrates the difference between flashy fighting and effective fighting. You think Qotho is winning easily because he gets a cut on Jorah's cheek and then knocks him down. He is jumping all over while Jorah is blocking and standing his ground, seeming to Imply that Qotho is controlling the fight, but really Jorah is just waiting for him to fuck up. Which he does.    
     
---Stannis raids the Wildlings    
Demonstrates the domination organized cavalry armies held against barbaric tribes of untrained cannibals.     

----The Worst----      
----The Sand Snakes vs Bronn and Jaime     
This is self apparent. No tension, obnoxious actresses, boring plot, and a lame ending. I understand this scene was filmed at a popular public spot and they had little time to rehears or shoot, but it doesn't change the fact that the scene is ass. Feels more like batman fight than GOT.        
      
----Sons of the Harpy ambush Grey worm and baristan     
Baristtan gets one fight scene in the entire show and dies in it. At the hands of knife wielding commoners? Sure he slaughters quite a few of them but the fact that he dies while grey worm lives is flat out insulting.     

----Ramsay and his men vs the Greyjoy infiltrators      
He has no shirt, he has just come from a masochistic fuck session, and he kills the best of the ironborn? Give me a break. Not to mention the whole scene makes sense, he lets the dogs out and it's supposed to be some HUGE game changer? Like what are the dogs going to do that your armored men couldn't?      
      
----Arthur Dayne vs Ned and company

Where do you think House Arryn will stand in the wars to come? Littlefinger said to Sansa in S06E10 that he had declared for Stark for all to see, but she rightly pointed out that Littlefinger always plays for Littlefinger so his declaration really doesn't mean much.

Arryn could hold the balance of power where every other house is making moves to stand with either Lannister or Targaryen (or is basically defunct - rip Baratheon). That sounds like a position Littlefinger would want to take advantage of. Varys also stands with Daenerys, so Littlefinger would likely be positioned opposite him.

Do you think Littlefinger will swing the Vale's forces for Cersei? Would Sweetrobin hold any sway?

All of Robert's illegitimate children like Gendry have black hair, and from the histories of the families Ned found so does every Baratheon ever.

But EVERY Lannister has gold hair. Joffrey's gold hair is zero proof of illigitimacy. So let's look beyond that into Joffrey's other characteristics.

Explosive, easily woken temper. No Lannister has this. They get angry. Cersei even makes poorly thought out decisions, (e.g. arming the sparrows) but she goes away and thinks about them first. No Lannister has a temper like this. It's Joffrey and Robert's defining characteristic.

Selfishness: Robert drove the kingdom to financial ruin with his partying. Direct quote about Robert ""The king does whatever he wants"". Direct quote from Joffrey ""A king can do whatever he likes."". The Lannister's are pretty damn selfish as well, but they're rarely this short sighted about it.

Ask yourself, of Cersei, Jamie, and Robert, who is Joffrey most like? Robert. Hands down. 

Is it plausible? In S1E5 Cersei says she had feelings for Robert for ""quite some time"" after they lost their first boy, and they were married. It's entirely possible she had another child of his.

Joffrey Baratheon is the rightful ruler of Westeros. Long may the maggots feast on his flesh.

Since that was all there was at the time I bought up all the books and burned through those and loved them. I then watched the show religiously all the way through the first half of season four.

I eventually went back and finished that season and about three episodes of season five. For whatever reason I then kind of just stopped watching. There was no real reason I just sort of did. 

Now, I've been itching to get back into it, but I'm a little hesitant. It's been long enough now that I have bits and pieces of major spoilers but not enough that id say it's not worth seeing for that reason alone. 

What worries me is that I can tell people aren't as into it, and I've heard people voice some reservations about where the show has gone and how it is handling some characters since it's broken off from the books. Are these concerns founded? Is the general consensus that the show is slipping? I just don't have as much time to watch shows anymore so I don't want to get into it again just to be disappointed...

While I wouldn't object to seeing the match on screen, I can think of several problems that would not make their union feasible:

1. Daenerys will not be happy in letting The North remain independent, and Jon would not betray his lords by bending the knee right after being declared king. This means such a match could only happen with the prospect of Jon and Dany's future child inheriting both kingdoms.
2. If they are to produce an heir, one of the monarchs would have to move to the others' seat of power. Neither the northern nor southern lords would be happy with their monarch essentially being a political hostage in another kingdom.
3. If they are to live under the same castle, it would make it impossible for one of them to administer their kingdom from so far away. Jon could set up Sansa as his proxy in the North, but then that could just lead to more turmoil among his subjects.
4. If it turns out Dany is indeed barren, then all of this would be for naught. Another succession crisis would plague Westeros once one or both of the monarchs dies.
5. If Jon and Dany are able to produce a child, I rather think the northern lords would find it hard to accept being subjects of the Iron Throne once again even if their next ruler would have northern blood.

As you can see, my primary concern with a marriage between Jon and Daenerys is how their subjects would react to such a union. Ultimately they would have to accept because their King's/Queen's word is final, but in my opinion it would not do well to breed resentment amongst your subjects like that. 

In the short term their alliance would certainly be most beneficial, uniting their armies against Cersei and the White Walkers to bring peace to the realm once again. I just don't see how their union lends itself for the stability of the realm in the long term. Anyways, I'm curious what other fans of the show and books think about this. Is it a bad idea, a good one, or an ugly one?

tl;dr: While a marriage alliance between Jon and Dany would help them in the short term to defeat their enemies and bring forth peace, theyre just setting themselves up for another succession crisis in the future. 

EDIT 1: I understand that Dany's marriage prospects are pretty much limited to Jon only, but the fact that this is her best option shows how dire the state of things are. In a world with dragons and walking corpses, I agree that things have to change dramatically in order for the realm to carry on. 

EDIT 2: All my points are assuming their marriage actually happens. Im not considering other things that might happen. Personally I believe that Jon will marry some northern lord's daughter, speacially after some of the season 7 leaks that have been going around.",45,31,False,self,,,,,

But this is a much more detailed version of that theory and is more related to the show then the books.
Okay first let's get into some actual evidence besides the forshadowing though yeah the forshadowing will come first:

- Cersei in the trailer atleast at the end is the only one the breathes cold breath. Why did it not show Jon or Dany do this? I think this shows not only does winter come up to KL but also foreshadows Cersei may be an ally of the night king and may even become a night queen.

- Also when The when we fade out to The Night king's eye it is after we see the last shot of Cersei.

- Now for this to work we will have to assume that Jaime and Cersei are the mad King's bastards (with either Tyrion along with them or a big twist Tyrion is the actual true son of Tywin and Joanna) this is important because the Night king will want her for her Dragons/Queen's blood (i also think that the Night King will grow to actually love her...If he is into Psycho queens who burn people alive with wildfire) Perhaps that is the key to making peace with the others but Cersei beats Jon and Dany to the punch and marries the night king first.

- Lena Headey (the actress who plays Cersei) along with the actors who play Jon, Jaime, and Tyrion have had there pay raised. I sadly can not remember by who much but it would be enough for her (including the other three i mention) to want to stay on for another season (that and i think she likes doing the show anyway).

- If we thing about it story wise it would kindof make sense. Think about it she has come this far and she will not be willing to give up the throne so she makes a deal with the devil by allying with the night king and becoming his night queen and also maybe it is what Maggie the frog really meant when she said she would marry the king she was not talking about Robert but the night king (i know they left that out but i still feel it implies in my opinion)

- Finally similar to a JONSA marriage (yes i said JONSA don't judge me) Cersei and the night king would be a union of Ice and Fire (If Cersei is a secret targ)

Now i still feel that Jaime is the Valonqar (outside of Arya) so if this theory is true it is possible Jaime may be Azor Ahai (or atleast one of the three heads) so what is the evidence for him being Azor Ahai. Well let's look into that now shall we.

- He would have dragons blood as he would be the mad king's bastard

- He was Reborn admits Salt and Smoke when the chopped his hand off. Smoke from the fire across from him and the salt from salty sweat or salty tears or maybe from the sept when it was burning (which is smoke) and the salt from the Bay near the city. Or some other big moment waiting to happen next season and later in the books (Maybe he will die and be reborn unburnt in a funeral pyre with Salty tears from Tyrion and he will come back to live in that moment unburnt and with targaryen Violet eyes)

- Lightbringer would be either oathkeeper or Widows Wail or maybe Dawn if he gets his hands on it somehow.

- Awakening dragons from stone i think will be awakening the dragon within him when he finds out the truth.

- Now the Sacrifice. When Azor Ahai tempered the blade he tried three times. Water, Lion, and finally the Nissa Nissa. The Water was when Jaime took Riverrun from the Tully's, The Lion is him letting his Lannister side go and becoming full targaryen, and the Nissa Nissa i think will be Cersei.

So to Recap i think it is possible that Cersei will become the night queen and if Jaime is Azor Ahai he will kill the woman he once loved. Cersei and defeat the white walkers as Azor Ahai.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

This will also lead up to Arya being reunited with her sister

-Jon will send Littlefinger with the knights of the vale down to the Riverlands to take Riverrun. Sansa will join him to recruit more men and use the Stark to gain more support.

-Arya will start heading north now that she is done in the Riverlands. Instead of making it to Winterfell, she will intersect with the knights of the vale and join the followers camp with a new face. She will act as a servant of sorts to stay near Sansa and Littlefinger to examine the situation. 

-The knights of the vale will intersect with the brotherhood without banners. Clegane will recognize Sansa and swear his sword to the Starks. At the same time, the brotherhood will do the same. 

-At that point, Clegane will look for an opportunity to tell Sansa the truth about what happened in the throne room and why her father was sent to the black cells. Arya will be close by when the Hound describes the event. When he reveals Littlefinger held a knife to the throat of Ned Stark, Arya will go straight to Littlefingers tent

-She will be in position to kill him, knife on his throat. The Hound and Sansa will walk in. Arya will take off the face, reveal to all who she is, and cut his throat. 

Potential issues related: Littlefinger is needed to the loyalty of the Vale. I don't believe this to be the case since Yohn Royce seems eager to be rid of Littlefinger as soon as the opportunity presents itself.

Why does he want Robb dead? Robb never wanted the throne and had no interest, and nedd always knew who should be on the throne and has continously said ""Stannis is the rightful king, by right.""

Was it because he felt Robb was siding with Renly Baratheon? Is that why he wanted him dead?

I was just rewatching this one part from Stannis and I just couldn't quite figure out why he hated the lad, like I said, Robb didn't care about the throne and he was even going up against Joffrey, and Stannis was doing the same.

I was rewatching season 2 and I found it odd that the Halfhand asked Ygritte if she knew him, and what the freefolk would do if they captured him. He then touched her face almost tenderly, or as if he was examining her like a doctor would or something.

It was like he was seeing if she would work out as far his plan to join Mance. When she replied that they'd cut his head off, he acted as if he expected the answer but was hoping for something else. 

Almost as if he wanted to go over WITH Jon (or instead of him). 

This assumes that he was ordered to get 'someone' inside of Mance's camp. 

Why do you think the Halfhand was like this? Checking over Ygritte like a horse, asking what would happen if he was captured? Was this the plan all along? Get Jon Snow to Mance? ",3,6,False,self,,,,,
