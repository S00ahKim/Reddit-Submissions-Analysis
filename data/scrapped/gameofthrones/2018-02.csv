The novels are called a Song of Ice and Fire for a reason, Ice and Fire will destroy Westeros and the new King will have to rebuild what was left from the destruction and carnage. This idea that Jon Snow is Ice and Daenerys is fire and together they will destroy the Night King, get married and restore House Targaryen doesnt make any sense.   

Here is a very important interview with George RRM about the books and the themes discussed in the books. 

&gt;For people who are not familiar with your work, the series takes place in an imaginary world. There is a struggle for control of the kingdom. This dynastic war is essentially one of three main plot lines. There are the other plot lines involving these sort of superhuman characters, and then theres the exiled Targaryen daughter who seeks the return of her ancient throne. Why those three main plot lines?  


&gt;**George RRM - Well, of course, the two outlying ones  the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons  are of course the ice and fire of the title, A Song of Ice and Fire.** The central stuff  the stuff thats happening in the middle, in Kings Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms  is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. Its loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. **You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within Kings Landing that theyre blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.**

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=340&amp;v=GaPZGDlm2F4)

He says that the threats that are happening away from Westeros are wayy more dangerous, yet the High Lords are just too much preocupied by the politics of Kings Landing and their silly Game of Thrones. The Dragons are a big threat and will cause the destruction of Westeros; Kings Landing will be burned down and turned into dirty; Daenerys will be The Queen of Ashes. It was foreshadowed in season 7 when she threatened over and over to fly her Dragons into Kings Landing.

As soon as she arrived in Westeros she mentioned that if Viserys had 3 dragons and an army on his back he would invaded Kings Landing already. Later Varys mentions that on that night she was born, a terrible storm  devasted the Kingdom and every single dog in Kings Landing howled through the night, this is not a good sign. This was a warning already, Daenerys dragons will burn down the country and turn cities into ashes. 

&gt;The Boltons are defeated, The was is over, winter has come. we should ride home and wait for the **coming storm.**

&gt;The war is not over, and I promise you friend, the true enemy wont wait out the storm, **he brings the storm.**

Her name is Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen. Dany AND The Night King will destroy Westeros and King Aegon Targaryen will be the one left to rebuild the Kingdom after Daenerys and the army of the dead left all in ashes and ruins, this is going to be Jon Snow song, **a Song of Ice and Fire.**

If Bloodraven was actually a sorcerer, he could have manipulated Bran's experience at the Tower of Joy.  And since there were no Weirwoods at the Tower of Joy, how could Bloodraven truly know.  The information recorded by the Weirwoods might only be Ned's storytelling to his children.

Why am I wary of Bloodraven?  The man never stopped serving the Targaryen dynasty, even in exile, and now he wants a Targaryen back on the throne.  Bloodraven is still playing the game of thrones.  Since Bran is the only one likely to replace him, Bloodraven must convince Bran that the Targaryen's are more noble than the those who worship the old gods.  To do this, Bloodraven artificially depicted Howland Reed stabbing Ser Arthur Dayne in the back, which in turn, turned his father's words into lies.

I suspect the events happened very differently at the Tower of Joy.  Just maybe, when Ned learned the truth of Lyanna, he stood down; however, the other northern men remained determined to wipe out the Targaryens.  Perhaps Ned, Reed, Dayne (and his two fellow Kings Guards) defended Lyanna and her baby from the vengeful northern men in a dramatic 5 on 5 battle.  Ser Arthur Dayne might have even lived but needed to fake his death to continue his duty of protecting the last Targaryen.  Ned's return of the Sword of Dawn may be part of this cover up.

The biggest wrinkle in this theory comes from when Ned paused on the steps upon hearing Bran's voice.  This could be a sorcerer trick as well, or more likely, more terrible writing by D&amp;D after having surpassed the books.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tyrion chooses his family over Daenerys and saves his brother (like a reverse of Jaime saving him in Season 4).

Long time Game of Thrones fan and mostly lurker on this sub here. I have been watching a lot of videos on YouTube about theories, Season 8 production news, and other things lately to get me through this Long Night until 2019. Having seen a ton of clips used in these videos from the History and Lore videos that come with the physical copies on each season, I decided to watch them all first hand, starting from season 1 onward. The second clip I watched is talking about the children of the forest, the pact between the children and the first men, the Andal invasion, etc. when [this image](https://imgur.com/ol0TP0N) of Bran the Builder came up. I know a lot of people don't think the theory of Bran the Builder actually being the Bran Stark we know is true, but the image really stuck out to me because it looks like he's in a chair similar to the one that Bran got in season 7 once he returned to Winterfell, except it is being covered up by his massive cloak. It's either that or at least something like it because he is being carried in the image I linked above. I just wanted to point it out, as I haven't seen anyone discuss this before. Sorry if it has been discussed before, I just wanted to know what you guys think and maybe spark some more discussion on the topic. Let me know what you think and I wish you good fortune in the wars (of waiting) to come!

I'll do my list based off your cliche fantasy classes. 
Protagonist character: Ser Arthur Dayne
Warrior: Barristan the Bold
Tank: Robert Baratheon
Healer: Thoros of Myr
Scout/ rogue: Brynden Rivers/ Blood Raven (need at least one Valyrian steel sword in case you run into a white walker)

""...In my eyes, this puts Eddard Stark in better context.  In the end, he lost the game of thrones and ended up with his head on a spike.  But hes hardly the only one, and many great lords who were far better politicians and courtiers than he was ended up dead. 

Which I think is something that people fail to comprehend about George R.R. Martins work  hes not an advocate of Machiavellian statecraft.  Ned Stark does the honorable thing and loses, but master schemers like Tywin or Tyrion wind up betrayed and either murdered or attempted-murdered and exiled, and Cerseis more second-string efforts result in the realm being misgoverned by loyal incompetents and herself arrested for adultery, treason, and conspiracy. 

If anything, what George R.R. Martin is saying is that there are no winners in the game of thrones.  The good die unluckily, the bad die deservedly, and honest efforts and clever schemes all end in disarray."" -Race for the Iron Throne: Political and Historical Analysis of A Game of Thrones, by Steven Attewell.",10,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here's what I mean: [https://imgur.com/a/gkg6N](https://imgur.com/a/gkg6N). It's not a big deal and maybe this is just to fit in with HBOGo's dark theme, but you can definitely notice in the darker scenes when the actual content is darker than the surrounding bars.

Anyway, I wanted to share my fix: 

1. [Ctrl] + [Shift] + i (open the element inspector)
2. [Ctrl] + f : search for ""rgb(15, 15, 15)""
3. Replace the second occurrence with ""rgb(0, 0, 0)""
4. All done!

Has this been bothering anyone else? If so, did the above fix work?",10,6,False,self,,,,,

I, like some of you, have seen a [number of fake Game of Thrones fighting game screenshots](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;biw=1229&amp;bih=587&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=ZF12Ws7PBNCL5wKEmYeADQ&amp;q=game+of+thrones+fighting+game&amp;oq=game+of+thrones+fighting+game&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0.0.10402.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.H2odeCePfQg) (not really fake, but just art). So I just wanted to come up with a roster of absolutely necessary characters, slightly less necessary, and not necessary but cool characters. Wanted to see what other people think would be  cool in such a game just because...I dunno I wish there was one.

Absolutely necessary characters:

- Jon Snow

- Jaime Lannister

- Arya Stark

- Robb Stark

- The Mountain

- The Hound

- Ramsay Bolton

- Khal Drogo

- Brienne of Tarth

- Bronn

Less necessary, but would still be cool:

- Eddard Stark

- Grey Worm

- Loras Tyrell

- Joffrey Baratheon

- Robert Baratheon

- Stannis Baratheon

- Theon Greyjoy

- Jorah Mormont

- Gendry

- Oberyn Martell

- Tormund

- Beric

- Thoros

- Ygritte

- Syrio Forel

- Generic Kingsguard

- Yara Greyjoy

- Euron Greyjoy 

- Rhaegar

Not necessary but would like to see: 

Davos, Sam, Tywin, Tyrion, Greatjon Umber, Daenerys (I guess with baby dragons just flying around burning shit?), Roose, Sand Snakes (someone somewhere likes them), Jaqen H'Gar, Balon Greyjoy, maybe Viserys, the bearded dude who was on Ramsay's side in the Battle of the Bastards.

Love that quote. It always intrigued me about the mind of the white walkers. So much can be discussed about them. When they rearrange the dismembered limbs of their dead, are they performing a ritual or do they just have a sadistic sense of humor? Is it a taunt, warning, or some form of pass time? Why cut up people and animals when they could have added more numbers to their army?

From the opening scene of the show, we see these things toss the decapitated head of one of the rangers to the other still alive, then let him live and flee south. They want the living to know they're back and we get a snapshot of their confidence here.

Now since the beginning of the show, the WWs have been in quite a few scenes, and aside from the Night King, I really don't see anything resembling intelligence or personality from them. Though cool (heh) and confident during encounters (see Sam and Jon's scenes with them), they aren't as dark and interesting as I had seen them be in that very first opening scene.

Do you think the WWs have changed through D&amp;D's writing of them since the beginning of the series?

*Just a reminder this is a discussion on the WW, not their Wight minions.*

But there's more to the scene. Theon's plot is a story of survival, fortitude and identity. He was violently mutilated, tortured for years and completely dehumanised as Reek, all as a result of his internal conflict with his identity as a Greyjoy raised by Starks. He suffered a lot but more importantly, he survived it all. He built up the courage to escape even though it seemed like he never would. Just like the fight scene, he was beaten to ground over and over but he came back up. I want to believe that being kicked in the groin was a reminder to himself that he has overcome MUCH worse. His identity crisis ended with Jon Snow forgiving him and telling him that he is both a Greyjoy *and* a Stark which gave him the strength he needed to try and save Yara.

The final few seconds of the scene of him washing his face in the sea seemed important for him in a few different ways. It symbolised him affirming his Ironborn culture, the death of cowardly Reek and the rebirth of Theon Greyjoy (what is dead may never die). I think the scene is really important for him because after all the horror he experienced, he learned from it, he learned that he's actually a very resilient person.

Having said all that, the Ironborn changing sides so easily just doesn't make sense to me. So, they follow Yara who has agreed to stop pillaging and raping, she gets captured, they decide to go East instead to ... pillage and rape, their leader gets punched so they agree to save her.

Season 7 felt slightly fast paced and unusual, but it sets things up nicely. I had a few general questions regarding the show, and would appreciate some answers.

1) What is the Night King's purpose? Is he gathering armies and dragons to march to King's Landing and sit on the Iron Throne? Does he want to rule Westeros or just wants to kill people?

2) The dragons are really cool and make for some epic scenes in the later scenes, but I dont understand why they are so liked. They come across as terrifying ""beasts"" and another reason is because they seem to be too powerful and anyone who has them becomes the strongest force. In a way I was happy to see the Night King get one dragon to balance things out.

3) This might be a controversial statement, but I was disappointed by the reveal that R + L = J. This is because it leads to Jon Snow being a Targaryean and not a Stark by blood. It also means that Jon Snow is the rightful heir to the throne and hence is a 'royal'. I liked Jon Snow as a bastard brought up by Ned Stark. This is because the best person on the show was just an ordinary guy who goes against great odds to prove himself as a great leader and someone we could root for. Knowing he is actually royalty affects that feeling to an extent. So my question is that what does making Jon the son of R and L accomplish for Jon and the overall plot?

4) Was the whole Essos storyline for Dany just to develop her and allow her to get an army? I understand this necessity, but was I the only one who found that plot the least entertaining?

Would really appreciate some answers.",22,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally I imagine him as an old man, with a face physically much like [Thedeon possessed by Saruman](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SFogXTIv3MY/maxresdefault.jpg) (something savage), but still with the body of a warrior, and every time I think about him I can't just help myself but seeing him shouting ""BURN THEM ALL"" while spitting around while shouting orders.",12,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

The scene that made me the most happy would probably have to be when arya reunited with Sansa, either that or when Joffrey or Ramsay died.

Saddest moment was when rickon died, I saw it coming but it was still sad.

Most shocking moment was the red wedding. I had a feeling something was going to happen but didn't know exactly what. 

Most angry moment was when stannis agreed to burn shireen alive, like wtf you moron! Wake tf up!

Most confused scene is when petyr baelish gave Sansa to the bolton's

Most disappointed when theon betrayed the Starks.

And note that I have absolutely ZERO evidence of this. It's just an idea and I wondered what people thought. Okay so this whole prophecy of TPTWP and AA being Jon is probably legit. Even if it's not lets just say it is for this idea to work. 

Do you think it's possible that Jon is named this so called hero but in fact it was actually someone else who was the hero but Jon gets all the praise for it. Yes he fits the prophesy but what if the prophesy was confused with someone close to Jon? If you get what mean... 

Like think of it this way. Example. Back in season 7 when Jon and crew went beyond the wall what if somehow the Hound or Jorah managed to slay the nightking and ended the White walkers? But died in the process along with everyone else except Jon. 
 Then Jon makes it back to the wall as the sole survivor and is remembered as the one who ended the night. Or in the case Azor Ahai. 

I guess the point is, the prophecy could still hold meaning but I wouldn't be surprised if some twist like that happened and it was someone completely different, but still within reason like The Hound, Jorah, Jamie, Brienne etc... 
It's something GRRM would probably do and I can imagine Jon hating the praise that he gets when he knows it's undeserved as he is a humble type man. 

I just feel like there prophecy will just be extremely foggy by the end of it and perhaps circle the truth rather then just point right at it like Jon. ",16,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I feel like its a pretty strong theory that Tyrion is a Targaryen but how do you think he got into lots Tywins hands?  Do you think when the mountain was supposedly killing the Targaryen children like all the stories say than Tywin actually saved the boy and that was Tyrion?  It would make sense with all the incest of Targaryens of why Tyrion is described as so grotesque in the books. I just dont know why Tywin would want to keep him safe? Maybe he has a soft spot for kids? But then also how did his wife actually die?  We only ever hear from Cersei that it was from childbirth and she wouldnt have actually been there to know so Tywin could have just been saying that. Or she actually could have died during childbirth and the baby also died and thats why Tywin had a soft spot for babies and saved Tyrion.

Do the children of the forest believe in the old gods or do they not believe in that?

My request is please someone who knows how to do this. Please make a Thomas the tank engine intro done game of thrones style with the theme song. 

Include locations of sodor, misty island and anything a Thomas buff would know of. 

Been watching Thomas with my toddler a lot and rewatching game of thrones with the wife, so I thought this would be a funny lil idea to try. 

I've looked online and can't find one like this and I am not saavy in the world of animation. The closest thing I've found is just someone using the Thomas song infront of the game of thrones intro.... that's the opposite of what I'm looking for hahaha.

If you can do this I would be so happy! And if you know anyone capable please pass this along. I don't have anything to offer with the new year being slow at work per usual but I will definitely smile and laugh and cheer and show it to all my friends and family that enjoy both.

Science part of reddit correct me if I am wrong. But since Jaime and Cersei are siblings, couldn't they have a 50% chance of producing a child that shares the exact same chromosomes as either of them.

Jaime has his fathers Y Chromosome

Cersei has her fathers X Chromosome, we will call this X^T
 
Both have 1 of their mothers X chromosomes, we will call these X^1 and X^2

Assuming that Jaime and Cersei both go the same X Chromosome from their mother (this completely falls apart if they didn't), making them:

X^1 + Y = Jaime

X^1 + X^T = Cersei

 then the 4 potential combinations they could produce would be:

X^1   +    Y = Almost genetically identical to Jaime.

X^2   +    Y = 1 Joanna Chromosome, 1 Tywin Chromosome.

X^1   +    X^T = Almost genetically identical to Cersei.

X^1   +    X^2 = Almost genetically identical to Joanna Lannister *their mother*. (wrap your head around that weirdness)

In any case *every* child that Cersei and Jaime has would by genetic standards be their siblings (as they would contain only genetic material passed down from Tywin and Joanna). Meaning if Cersei is really pregnant, and with a boy. Then if she were to die in childbirth, the prophecy could be considered complete, as her male children are genetically her little brothers.

After re-reading the first book, I got to thinking about a weird connection.  On many occasions, it talks about Jon flexing his hand to help it heal from the burns.  In many of the Catlyn chapters it talks about her doing that as well, as she heals from the dagger wounds.  It comes up a lot, in both POVs.  I feel like it has to mean some kind of connection or foreshadowing or whatever.  It just struck me as weird how often and how similarly it comes up, especially for two characters that don't seem to have much of a connection. ",3,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is not me calling her ""The Mad Queen"", this is just me acknowledging that the show has in fact at times brought it up with her character, even having other characters mention it to her. It was in Season 7 that we really got to see her thirst for conquest, her quick temper, and that she was willing to burn men without considering other options. 

It almost feels like in any other story, she would be getting set up as a villain. But instead we have a situation where the show will have her at times do cruel things, and have parallels between her and her father's behavior, and yet will still paint her as a hero and savior. Almost as if DnD want to show her as morally grey and a hypocrite, but don't want to fully go through with it, maybe due to the character's popularity. But in any other story, I swear it would be obvious to any viewer or reader that this character is going down a dark path at this point. But there's 6 episodes left, which seem like they'll be dedicated to the White Walker event, so I'm having my doubts. I'm not saying I want her to be a villain, but I don't want this series to end without all those moments of her doing cruel things having some kind of a point to it all.",8,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

I mean its pretty common for people to have their fathers hair color, myself included. And seeing how Robert was all for killing Dany when she was a young girl there was no way he could have seen silver-haired Jon without going ballistic. 


What would Ned have done? Seems pretty unlikely that Ned would still raise him as his own, to me it feels like he would have hidden him from everyone or sent him far away because there is no way he could have lived with the rest of the Starks. 


Do you think Jon would ended up having a similar story to Dany? Sent as far away as possible from Bobby B?

I ask because I think of it in two different ways.

Sansa story has been about politics the way Jons has been about leadership and war, and Aryas has been about being a assassin. Sansa has learned from a lot of people about how to be a good leader. From Ned she got her honor but has adapted it to fit in a place like kings landing. Little Finger she learned how to think like her enemies and play the game. Even from Cersei and Ramsay she learned important lessons. If she is the queen then who is the king? In the first episode Robert tells Ned they should join their houses and I think it would be fitting and surprising to see that happen. Gendry is a underdog but he is also the last of the Baratheons and has a claim through Robert. You may ask what about Jon and Dany. I think at least Dany will die and I can make a whole post about that. What do you think can you see this happening or is there something to disprove it?",37,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

People always call him the bitch king that was easily manipulated without acknowledging that as the whole point of his character. Much like the whole point of Jeoffrey was to be a cunt, the point of Tommen is that he's a child. He tries to mend the crown's relationship with the small folk through the Faith, and he succeeds. Even if doing so alienates Cersei, there's no way Tommen knew just how evil she really was. Also, being manipulated by Maergery. Any of you single men out there, lie to me and tell me why you wouldn't let Natalie Dormer do anything she fucking wants with you...

Obviously I love the Game of Thrones universe, so having an extension of that with more information, more backstory, more characters introduced, more of the lore brought to light, and just *more* in general seems fantastic.. However, at the same time I really am concerned.

I can't personally think of a spin off series I have legitimately enjoyed, or one that has even come close to being as good as the original series it was based off. I am doubly worried with that because of how high GoT set the bar in the first place, that I would be surprised if it could live up to that. I also feel like a lot of spin off or prequel series come off as quick cash grabs by being associated with the successful original series, and the potential of 'tainting' the series or running it into the ground over time is also a point of concern for me. I guess it also raises the question: Is it even necessary? Should we just let this wonderful series go out on (hopefully) a high note? Obviously it's hard to have a complete opinion at this point in time, but i'm already feeling conflicted.

Granted, it would be the Iron Bank who payed for the Golden Company since *all* of the Highgarden's gold went to to them to pay off the debts of the throne, but doesn't something seem a little.. weird about that?

You have Cersei(known for being less than intelligent) entrusting Euron Greyjoy(who is true to the Greyjoy infamy) with a deal set up by the Iron Bank(who are known to support multiple claims to the throne simultaneously) to bring the Golden Company(who fights for *whoever* pays) to Westeros. This is honestly, in my opinion at least, a recipe for a detrimental betrayal to the ""Queen of the ~~7~~ 3 Kingdoms.""

It would play into what we've seen all along with the show with each faction involved. A Greyjoy attempting to steal the Kingdom from Cersei, the Iron Bank not caring who is involved so long as they reap the benefits, the Golden Company supporting the person that made the deal in person, and Cersei once again failing to think about the critical errors in her plans. All she's done for the Golden Company was have Qyburn write a letter to make the deal.. which doesn't have as much merit to Euron himself *getting* them. Now she may have had a huge benefit to her in Season 7, but that was far less to do her own strategies as it were Euron's, Jaime's, and Qyburn's. Jaime's gone, Euron's not above being a traitor(esp. for ***the 7 Kingdoms***), and Qyburn's all she has left besides The Mountain.. who can't stop *every* member of the Golden Company.

What do you guys think about this? And if this might not happen, what is your take on how his scenario will play out in the series?",12,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Would it have been better for the unity of the seven kingdoms if Joffrey lived?

During a rewatch of season three (specifically, episode 4 ""And Now His Watch Is Ended), Margery is obviously adored by the people of King's Landing. At the same time, she seems to have a significant effect in softening Joffrey, and making him a better king.

While this does not have such an immediate impact (he still is kind of a dick for the rest of the season) could Margery's impact on him have had a better long-term effect than what happened? Joffrey seems at least somewhat tired of being told what to do by Cersei, and she exerts her influence through force. Margery, on the other hand, influences slowly and through encouragement. While both manipulative, Joffrey seems to take to Margery better because she strokes his ego.

It's understandable that Olenna and Baelish (along with Margery) think that they can influence Tommen better, and maybe they're right. However, the outcomes of Joffrey's death might be worse than leaving him alive:

Tyrion is blamed for the killing. This led to both the deaths of Tywin Lannister (unless you believe the theory that Oberyn had already poisoned him) and Oberyn Martell. Say what you want about Tywin, but he was pragmatic and intelligent. Cersei makes obvious blunders (do you really think Tywin would have allowed the Faith Militant to rise?) that result in the fracturing of the realm.

Tywin is the real loss, at least as far as realm unity goes. However, Oberyn's death leads to the murder of Doran Martell after he refuses to retaliate, eventually pushing Dorne away from the Lannisters. The rise of the Faith Militant, something that again would not have happened under Tywin, leads to the death of just about all of House Tyrell. This makes Olenna hate the Lannisters and the crown, pushing them away too.

In the North, there are two paths: either Tywin supports the Boltons and Baelish refuses to attack because he's an opportunist. Otherwise, Tywin refuses to support the Boltons, let's Baelish take the North, and forges an alliance with Tywin, because again, he's an opportunist. Either way: Tywin likely keeps alliances with the Riverlands, the Reach, Dorne, the Iron Islands, and at least maintains peace with the Vale and North. With him dead as a result of Joffrey's murder, the Westerlands and Crown are fighting the North, Dorne, the Reach, the Vale, and the Riverlands, even before Dany's arrival.

Sure, Cersei makes some solid maneuvers to defeat Dorne, Yara and Theon, the Reach, and have Dany and her side believing they're suing for peace while bringing in the Golden Company. However, for a Crown still in considerable debt to the Iron Bank, this would have significant long-term effects even if they do win. This would not have even been necessary had Tywin stayed alive.

Under Tywin's guidance and Margery's influence, Joffrey temper and rash decisions would have been curtailed. Cersei's bad choices diminished, and the realm unified. I'm unsure what he would have done about Dany's arrival, but he still at least would have been in a better position to deal with her arrival. The Lannisters bent the knee to a Targaryen and three dragons before, I have no doubt they'd be willing to do it again under Tywin.

Daenerys shows up on Westeros. She has three dragons, Dorne, Highgarden and the Dothrakis. And half the forces of the Iron Islands, with the Iron Fleet itself, which is around ten thousand.

-Dorne can round up to fifty thousand men.

-Highgarden, one hundred thousand. And dont start with this oh but theyre not good fighters because they are. They won the war against Stannis on behalf of the Lannisters for fucks sake.

-The Dothrakis, well...I dont really know ? If Drogo had fourty thousand with him, one can assume that a good hundred thousand is following her.

Thats around two hundred and sixty thousand. With three dragons. And the best fleet possible.

On the other side...you have Cersei. The Lannisters are on their own. The Riverlands are in ruins and House Frey is gone. The Eyrie are allied to the North, which is itself in open rebellion; theres probably a good hundred thousand troops there. The Lannisters (lead by fucking Tywin himself) were already struggling againt the Young Wolf and his twenty thousand men, and now, they suddenly crush everyone in one fell swoop ? Dorne, Highgarden, poof ?

After years of war, of poverty, of ruined countryside and famine, they still find a way to kick Danys ass with...how many fucking armies do they even have ? And Eurons fleet ? Dont make me laugh. What the fuck kind of fleet is immune to dragon fire ? What kind of fleet can take on the Iron Fleet ?

I understand that they coulnt just end Cerseis arc like that, thats its for the show, but...realistically, shed have lost in two, three weeks.

EDIT : I forgot about the Unsullied. Which makes the whole situation even worse.

She's not afraid of being bullied by Tywin and knows how to press his buttons, but she also knows where to draw the line and secede.

Out of wall the visions she has there I have to say the scene where she sees Drogo in the tent beyond the wall is so beautifully done and one of my favorite scenes in the show. I love the writing as well... lines like ""until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until rivers run dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves then you shall return to me my sun and stars"" and when Drogo tells her he told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself until she joined him. Is anyone else obsessed with this scene? 

I know Drogo gets a lot of hate because of the beginning of their story and rape aspect but I feel like this dislike is unjustified. Despite the fact Drogo bought Daeny no one can deny the fact that they're deeply in love with each other by his death. And despite the culture he comes from it can be argued that he and Daeny have more of an equal relationship than almost any other royal couple in the show. He listens to and respects what she says, and enforces her decisions to the rest of the tribe. Even in Westeros this is more power than most Kings/lords give their queen/lady except for the matriarchal families like the Tyrells and Martells. I truly wish we could've seen Drogo sail across the narrow sea and give Daeny her iron throne... But I guess we see by this scene he's still waiting for her on the other side.

I also am interested in the possible symbolism/foreshadowing in this particular vision. For starters, Daney is in the Red Keep, about to touch the Iron Throne when she hears the horse (or is it the Dragons?) and turns around, leaving the Iron Throne to go find the tent. Could this be foreshadowing that Daeny will one day sacrifice her claim to the throne for love? Also why is the tent beyond the wall? Is it simply representative of the magic that lies there? Or is there a chance Drogo is shown there because she's going to meet her own death past the wall? I almost wonder if this vision wasn't supposed to be a trap similiar to the Lotus Hotel in the Percy Jackson series (a hotel designed to keep the heroes happy and make them lose track of time so they forget about their quest) by making Daney want to stay in that vision. I find it interesting that she only seems to snap out of it by hearing the squeal of the horse/dragon (really can't tell which one), and that as she does snap back you see Drogo's face freeze back into the blank, empty stare he had when the witch brought him back. Almost like the vision was only as real as she believed it to be. It also might reveal her true priorities- she leaves the throne for Drogo, then Drogo for the dragons. You see this same reveal of priorities in the S7 finale. Against advisement she's willing to risk herself as a queen to save Jon and the others beyond the wall, but ultimately leaves Jon to save her dragon. 

What did everyone else think about this scene, the possible symbolism/foreshadowing and Daney/Drogo's tragic love story in general? I also have a clarification question about witch who did the blood magic... I know the witch ""knew the price"" but did their unborn child die as a direct result of the blood magic or was it going to die anyways? (meaning the scene in the vision was showing what they actually would've had if not for the witch) And did the witch make Drogo worse intentionally or was she actually trying to cure him?

Please only read if you are up to date to the end of season 7. Potential spoilers.

I dont know if this has been mentioned before but when re-watching the series earlier this week I noticed the window behind the Iron Throne changes throughout the series. When Robert is King the window is ornate stained glass. When Joffery and Tommen are King the window has a seven pointed star hanging in front of it. When Cersei is Queen the window has a Lannister Lion hanging in front of it. In Daenerys vision the destroyed great hall has the seven pointed star behind the Iron Throne. Cersei is currently Queen with the Lion displayed behind the Iron Throne. So does this implies that before the destruction of the Great Hall in Daenerys vision someone else will sit on the Iron Throne? It seems too obvious a change to be a continuation error. What are your thoughts on this, is there any meaning to the window being a different design in the vision?",19,4,False,self,,,,,

The way I think about it, it is the best solution to a lot of questions. To be clear I mean did Littlefinger hire Jaqen to kill Ned and his kids? Not Catelyn. Also I tried looking this up on reddit and could not find a post about it so i might just be crazy here. 

Well first did Littlefinger have the means to do hire him, and did he know about the faceless men? 

Yes to both. in the first book and season 1 he talks about sending one after Danny and how expensive they are. It is said that the faceless men cost a lot, but as ""Master of Coin"" he would have the ability to acquire to lots of money, also it is clearly stated that even during peace time the crown has massive debt, despite having more incomes. Their is some evidence that he was embezzling it, and he differently could have if he wanted to.

If he had the means to what about moral qualms? 

Littlefinger betrays Ned and starts the war of the 5 kings killing thousands, clearly he is amoral. 

Did he have a motive to kill the Starks?

Yes, he was crazy in love with Catelyn Tully, in fact he already tried to kill Ned's big bro for her. 

What would if all this is true what would Littlefingers plan?

Step 1. kill Jon Arryn, Send a letter to get the Starks getting them all to come south. 
Step 2. Hire Jaqen to kill all the starks 
Step 3. Console Catelyn, getting her back.
Step 4. Use Stark deaths to start the war.
Step 5. Chaos is a ladder use war to climb ladder with Catelyn.


How would this fit into the story? 

The plan clearly fell apart though, exactly when Littlefinger met Catelyn's daughter Sansa Stark at that tournament. It was some clearly some weird pedo version of love at first site, and he Little Finger was visibly shaken. BECAUSE HE JUST HIRED A NO ONE TO KILL HER, I think it was kind of an oh shit moment for him. So he tries his best to call it off keeping a close eye on the Starks to make sure they don't get 'Lannistered'. Moving forwards Ned get put in the black cells, where Jaqen finally arrives to make his move. Little finger knew he was coming and had keen enough eyes to look for glamors, (kind of assuming that's how he changes his face) Little Finger confronts Jaqen. They talk but it becomes apparent that Jaqen isn't an assassin hes a lunatic cultist who kills for some weird god. A price was paid and cant be unpaid or something like that. Little Finger was doing this all on his turf where he controlled the jail and the guards; in I think it was Storm of Swords, I can't say when but Tyrion Looked over the Little Finger's books and found that a lot of the guards did not exist. So he had Jaqen arrested, but killing a Faceless man seemed like a bad idea. So he was locked away. Little Finger did not plan on him having the escape of the Night's Watch, at least not so soon. 

So why did Jaqen not at least kill Arya stark?

When Arya is on a ship to Braavos. It is hinted very strongly that Faceless men cant kill people they know. Jaqen spent weeks in a box next to Arya, plenty of time to get to know her. Also she saved his life, and only life pays for death(still not exactly sure what that means but it seems like it works). One step further and all the other Starks are reported as dead. Jaqen next clearly infiltrates High Tower, to much stuff to it might be, but one thing that exists at the tower is a glass candle so he could find any living Starks. That might just be about hatching a dragons egg. 

A few last things.  This answers a lot of questions very well. The biggest issue I have had with Jaqen is nobody in Kings Landing who is important to our story is dead from him.  I cant think of any other way Jaqen could have been captured. Also i suspect Biter and Rorge wore with Jaqen and who ever they wore sent to help him. Meaning Jaqen was their for a very high value target. But they wore all out 'littlefingered' now who could out 'littlefinger' 3 faceless men? ",35,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

We have  also seen some return in various ways (Jon, Sandor, Benjen). Who do you think is most likely to return, if any of them, in the final season. Here are some of the contenders IMO.

Stannis- Usually on Got, or any series, you should expect a return of a character if you didn't see the death on screen. For a long time I was expecting his return, but now find it unlikely. I can't imagine Brienne being merciful, and I can't see how he would come into the plot now.

Syrio- See above. There's the theory that he and Jaqen were the same person. Maybe a reunion with Arya when she is in dire straits?

Catelyn- dipping into the books here as we all know she returned as Lady Stomeheart. It seems as if we are too far gone.for this to be implemented into the show now. 

Waif- I think it's unlikely, but the theory of her being Arya will hang around for.some time. Especially after Arya mirrored her movements when sparring with Brienne.

Ned- It would be a major surprise, and would take some explaining. A lot of people seem to be clinging on to hope though.

Oberyn- Definite no, but we can dream!

Personally, I think they are all unlikely. If I was to guess at any though it would be Ned. Purely because his return would fit into plot development, and I wouldn't bet against a major WTF moment at the end

Any other thoughts?",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Before someone posts: ""She sacrifices them to the Lord of Light and he has this huge hard-on for flames'n'fire.""

I hear that. (Although wouldn't you want to sacrifice something more precious than a traitor?  Where those virgins and calves at?)

But I'm rewatching ""The Wars to Come"" (S05E01), where she's about to light up Mance Rayder, and it occurs to me that dying by fire (according to Melisandre) is the ""purest death."" She uses this line specifically to console an avid Lord of Light fan before his death by (wild)fire, presumably as a means of *reassuring* him in his final moments.

It seems like historically, traitors have been given decidedly *dishonorable* deaths as a means of indicating how unpardonable their crime is (e.g. Romans and crucifixion). Although I suppose you might argue she wants the fire to ""burn away the traitors' darkness"", why does she give those who betray her king this opportunity for redemption? Is there an element of altruism in her executions? 

Why does Melisandre allow traitors to die in what she seems to consider the most rewarding way possible, rather than giving them the *worst* death possible?",30,28,False,spoiler,,,,,

To me, that didn't make her a badass / gangsta / real G. She was going to die, and thanks to Jamie, she was going to die a painless death. She said that phrase **after** she drank her poison - literally anyone, a coward, a thief, a loser, etc., in that moment would have said the same thing.

So i was thinking about the religions in GoT and what they could be inspired from, and rather then a 1 on 1 comparison I found myself thinking they could actually represent one of the aspects present in any religion



* Faith of the Seven - Political Power

When I think of the seven what comes to mind first is the image of big majestic churches in KL, fat corrupted priests dressed in full regalia whos priority is to obtain power and wealth for themselves and their religion. The culture of the faith of the seven is so rooted in the society of Westeros that they represent a political powerhouse, mirroring the the feudal system and nobility


* The Old Gods - Spirituality

Good old Ned went to clean is sword in episode one in the Godswood, possibly questioning if it was right to chop the guy's head off. All we know about this religion is that people do their praying in private, Sansa does it often in KL. There is no preaching, no intermediary priest, no detailed definition of God, just a simple and direct connection between oneself and the vague figure of ""the Gods""


* The Lord of Light - Righteousness / Zealotry

We experience it basically through Melisandre. Whatever she does is justified cos its in God's name, so sacrificing people or even burning children is no big deal. Also her God is the one true God, without a doubt, even if there is millions of people worshipping different ones, there is no way that any of them could possibly be right, she is always 110% confident whenever acting in God's name. The name of the god itself screams righteousness.

Now Tyrion is actually in a position to hire a faceless man (Arya) to kill Cersei and considering that's a big name on her list she'd never say no. Could still fulfill the valonqar prophecy as Tyrion would be the one 'hiring' Arya to actually do the deed.

One thing that's always been at the back of my mind is; why did they bring back Gendry?

Gendry was in Season 2 to 3 for 2 main reasons, to service Arya's Riverlands subplot, and to serve as a scapegoat for Stannis Baratheon.

As Stannis is gone (along with all of House Baratheon), his bloodline 'probably' isn't exactly relevant anymore, as I don't see anyone of power legalizing him as 'Lord Gendry Baratheon' just because they can. So I believe the sole reason Gendry was brought back was to develop (or finalize) Arya's arc. Now, Arya seemed pretty indifferent when she came across Hot Pie at the Inn at the Crossroads, but at the same time she was pretty indifferent when she left him there during Season 3. However, she seemed to be really upset when Gendry told her that he would stay with the BwB, and she got even more torn up when the BwB sold him off to Stannis, to the point where she abandons them.

Realistically, the only (re)connection I can see Arya and Gendry making that can't be serviced by Jon, Sansa or Bran is that of a romantic one, and no, I don't religiously ship them, I just honestly can't think of any other reason for them to bring him back out of the blue if it weren't to develop Arya's character in a way the other main character's couldn't.

All that leads me to think that her arc in Season 8 will be one of humanization. She shows the beginnings of it in Season 7 when she chooses to return to Winterfell to reunite with her family, rather than continue to King's Landing to continue her revenge. I think Jon and Sansa will continue to push the whole 'lone wolf dies, but the pack survives' message, and as both of them have learned to forgive (Jon worked with the wildlings, and forgave the Night's Watch mutineers who didn't actually kill him, and Sansa valued her friends in KL, even if they fall under an umbrella of something she should despise e.g. Tyrion), and for reasons mentioned above, I think the only reason that Gendry is back is to allow Arya to connect with someone on a level that she can't really do with Sansa or Jon.

Do I think she should die? Well as we all know Arya has a suit of plot armor that would give Han Solo a run for his money, so if she dies in the heat of a duel or battle, then my palm would most likely be embedded in my face before the mandatory sad music kicks in. If she does die, then her death should mirror her own character. Arya's all ways been about sneaking around, backstabbing (or throat slitting) instead facing her enemies head on with nothing to hide like Jon or Robb, and generally using 'dirty tactics', and her death should probably be something along those lines. Although I'm pretty indifferent as to whether she dies or not as long as her arc is brought to a satisfying close.",56,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

This theory is based off a video I just watched on YouTube with few views yet I found it pretty convincing so let's start. Over the course of the series, the two greatest players of the ""great game"" have been Varys and Littlefinger. Both characters have helped set in motion the series of events that we watch unfold every Sunday night when the show is in season and they both have ulterior motives that even we do not know. Since season seven ended I was, in all honesty, disappointed that Littlefinger was killed off. Don't get me wrong, I personally didn't like him--he was a conniving flatterer who, as Varys tells Lady Olenna, would ""see [Westeros] burn if it meant he could be king of the ashes""--but for the series to build up his storyline with a mysterious endgame only to have him killed for something he should've been killed for long ago just doesn't add up.

Much like the video, I'll start off with the scene that made Littlefinger realize he was in danger. In episode 4 of season 7, Littlefinger discusses the attempted assassination on Bran before he became the Three-Eyed Raven. When being asked about his view on the continued chaos in the world, Bran tells Littlefinger, ""chaos is a ladder"", an iconic quote Littlefinger once told Varys when the two verbally sparred in the throne room of the Red Keep back in season three. This obviously surprised and even frightened Littlefinger because it was at this moment that he had to realize that Bran does in-fact have powers to see anywhere into the past, present, and perhaps the future. If Littlefinger realized this, and I'm sure he did, why would he allow himself to stay at Winterfell? It would only be a matter of time until Bran tells the Northern Lords that Littlefinger betrayed Ned or that he killed Lysa Aryn. At this moment Littlefinger realized that he was vulnerable but he couldn't just order Ser Royce to pack up the entire army of the Vale and march home so he did something else...

In season 4 we learn that Littlefinger's great-grandfather was from Braavos and in season 7 he reveals to Sansa that he knows about the Faceless Men and what they do. The episode after Bran talks to Littlefinger (season 7, episode 5), Arya (who is now back home) distrusts Littlefinger and begins spying on him. One of the first scenes shown of her spying on him is when he is listening to a young maiden whispering in his ear. This girl isn't just a normal spy for Littlefinger, in fact, if you listen closely you can make out what she says and she tells him that his ""time is up"". Immediately after that Littlefinger looks at her before giving her a silver-looking round object--a coin. Now, this isn't just any type of coin; this is a Braavosi coin, the same kind Jaqen gave to Arya. This ""maiden"" is a faceless man who has been living in Winterfell and has now taken payment to take the face of Littlefinger and take his place in death because ""only death can pay for life"". Littlefinger, thanks to his Braavosi background, knew how to cheat death and was able to escape.

Sometime after this scene took place, the real Littlefinger fled Winterfell and allowed this faceless man/woman to take his place and die. The question now is, where did he go? 

What do you all think?

I now believe there's more proof to back up my claims. Producers talk in the S7 commentary about Cersei and the map painted on the floor of the courtyard in King's Landing. One of them says: ""Dan and David asked us to make it an **exterior location** in an upcoming episode, but I can't tell you why, but that will pay off too"". And then another line in the commentary: ""... Hence the sunlight. It used to be at least a story taller, but there was **a need to see the sky** in this coverage. **Forthcoming coverage**"". I think what we'll see is Cersei in the courtyard, planning her victory against Jon&amp;Dany, and a dragon's shadow will cover the map and shee'll look up, only to see them flying over King's Landing, just like in Bran's vision.",19,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

But how come Jon &amp; Co. *can* take a wight south of the wall, before the wall falls?

It's clear from the Dragon Pit scene that the captured wight is really not suffering any sort of magical ""disease"" from being south of the wall - he is just as ""fit"" and ""active"" as he was north of the wall.

So, is this some kind of descrepency/plot hole? How do we reconcile these things?

Tyrion- Smartest of the Lannisters, constantly outwitted by Jaime and Cersei after landing in Westeros. Suggesting stupid idea of capturing a white walker when he should have known Cersei wont change her mind anyway (even there she pretended to and he fell for it)

Varys- He is totally useless now. Suddenly all his informers are gone, he has no knowledge about anything, he is just there for the sake of it in the show now

Littlefinger- Outwitted by Sansa Stark and getting killed.

* The combined armies go north and fight the army of the dead, defeating it but at great cost.  However, the Night King and his dragon are not there.  Why?
* They flew south and destroy King's Landing, trading his army of 100,000 for the 1,000,000 in King's Landing including Cersei.  They foreshadowed it too much in the last episode.
* Euron and the Golden Company arrive at King's Landing to a trap, where they are also killed and join the Night's King army.
* Dany finds out she's pregnant
* Bran and Sam keep Jon's parentage a secret after Dany and Jon declare they are getting married, or they at least tell Jon who doesn't have a chance to tell Dany before the end.
* Jamie ends up at the end killing Cersei to fulfill the prophecy in the last battle.  He survives to become the 1000th Lord Commander and restore the wall and honor to the Night's Watch
* Bronn survives and gets The Twins when it's all over, as Tyrion is good to his word to double what he is being paid (1 castle)
* The Hound survives and stays with Tyrion, who retires as Hand of the Queen and goes back to Casterly Rock as it's Lord.  He changes the Lannister's wealth from gold to wine, as he opens his vinyard there and becomes rich by supplying the 7 Kingdoms.  Remember there's always a Clegane to help a Lannister, so The Hound goes with him.
* Cleganbowl never happens because they hate us
* Gendry survives and is legitamized by Jon/Dany 
* Bittersweat ending is that Dany gives birth to a child, maybe even twins, but dies in childbirth or shortly after.  Jon becomes King of the 7 kingdoms, but loses another love of his life and raises his children/child
* In the battles, all the dragons die.  However, in some last scene it's discovered that they laid eggs before the last battle.

I really just wanted them all in writing so if I'm right I can gloat at some point.  What do you think of what I think will happen, and do you have any to add and why?

He says multiple times that this is all that matters, and it seems that because of the circumstances of Tyrion's birth, in while he killed Tywin's wife (and cousin) and the nature of Tyrion's perceived monstrosity, that Tywin hates Tyrion and wants him dead.

However, is this really true?

Throughout the first few seasons, Tywin seems to flip flop between accepting and rejecting Tyrion. He never flat out says he loves him or is proud or anything, but at certain points he acknowledges Tyrion's talents and understands that Tyrion is actually a more polished mind than either of his other two children -- therefore able to contribute to the Lannister name. He allows him to be acting Hand of the King while he is away, and does acknowledge that Tyrion helped save the city. Without his defensive strategy, even the arrival of the combined Lannister-Tyrell forces may not have been enough. Tywin knows that, and rewards him by naming him Master of Coin.

Tyrion protests that he knows nothing of saving money, but Tywin seems to brush that aside. He mentions in other conversations with Cersei that the kingdom is in incredible debt to the Iron Bank, and yet he puts Tyrion in charge of the kingdom's finances? That is an unspoken but serious respect of Tyrion's brain.

Yes, he refuses to allow Tyrion to become Lord of Casterly Rock, and that is a sign of his inherent distaste for his son. However, he never really wants Tyrion dead. During the trial, he allows Cersei to manipulate everything to convict Tyrion. He does want Tyrion to be guilty, but not dead.

He's a strategic thinker, and understands that Joffrey died not because of a hatred for Lannisters, but because Joffrey was a monster. While Joffrey is literally lying dead, still warm, in the Sept of Baelor, Tywin is beginning to groom the more easily manipulated Tommen. He knows Joffrey would have brought shame to the Lannisters, and while he had no hand in his death (although I maintain that if he knew about the plot, he would have let it happen), he isn't upset that Joffrey is dead. He decides not to pursue the real perpetrators because the death, overall, was good for the Kingdom and for the Lannister family.

Instead, he uses it to his advantage. He leverages Tyrion's impending doom to force Jaime to resign from the Kingsguard and retake his position as the heir to Casterly Rock. He intends to send Tyrion to the Wall -- where he can hypothetically earn honor for the Lannisters in a small way. Tyrion would undoubtably done well there, and record books would show that wherever a Lannister went, they succeeded.

Joffrey's death and Tyrion conviction would rid him of the son he hates, give back the son he wants, allow him to gain greater control on the crown, and maintain his alliance with the Tyrells.",20,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Arya was pretty exciting in the beginning when she was learning with Syrio Forel, and when she was with the recruits, but towards the end she is just a fkn murderous psychopath. Literally had a screw loose.  I just cant stand her personality.  

Jon is honorable to the point of being a whiny bitch.

The story of how valyrian people rose to an continental empire is very interesting. 

The valyrians were said to be simple sheep herders in ancient times. They somehow found dragons and managed to tame them. They pretty much conquered everything in essos after that. 

There are many wars involved in the story like the war with Old Ghis and the great war with Rhoynish people. It involves legendary figures like Garin the great and Queen Nymeria. 

We'll get to see Valyria in in it's peak. They had thousands of dragons, which is what most people like to see. 

The series could end with Targaryen family leaving Valyria and finally the Doom. 

I think this would be great foundation for a series on Aegon's conquest.

The most prominent relationship between a man and his aunt in the western canon comes to us from Wagner. In his epic 4 opera *Der Ring Des Nibelungen* cycle, one of the central relationships is between Siegfried, the grandson of Wotan king of the gods (coincidentally, Siegfried is born of the incestous relationship of his parents) and Brunnhilde, valkyrie and daughter of Wotan. And it is this aunt-nephew love which ultimately leads to the consumption of both the world and the gods by fire, and the ultimate rebirth of the world afterwards. 

Whether this has any connection to our Aunt-Nephew relationship, I'm not sure; but since Martin is explicitly engaged in an artistic dialogue with the tradition, its certainly something to keep in mind.",8,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

Most of these are a stretch but if they happen I need to take credit. 


John doesn't want to be a king so he makes Tormund the King of the North (who better to rule the north than a warrior from north of the wall?)

Cersie isn't going to let her army travel north to fight the walkers so Jamie kills her (fulfilling the prophecy) as he thinks she is the next ""mad king"" (and now he's also the 'queenslayer')

One of the dragons is going to be killed before the fight with the white walkers (probably not drogon because he deserves a dope battle with the dead dragon). Cersie will order it to be killed despite Jamie trying to convince her it's not the smart thing to do

Cersie's baby will be turned into a white walker. This is unlikely because a lot of people think she's lying about being pregnant but it'd be a great twist as nothing else has come of the scene where Craster's baby is turned. 

Arya's gonna be losing a fight in a forest and Nymeria will save her (clich but cool)

Greyscale will have some link to the white walkers. Here's some stuff I wrote a while ago about that:
&gt; The people who get too infected with grey scale are sent to live in the ruins of Valeria where valerian steel was created. They mention that dragon glass is a cure to grey scale. The night king needs babies to make white walkers and he does this by touching their face. Grey scale is transferred through touch and no one knows where it originated. The first stone man was created when the night king tried to turn a living man into a walker. 

So maybe Jorah will be immune to the white walkers' ice weapons? Something along those lines...

The Mountain won't die from obviously fatal wounds because ""what's dead may never die"". This is another stretch but imagine seeing the mountain with huge gashes and hole in him mowing though a bunch of wights. That or The Hound will win Clegane Bowl but The Mountain won't die when he should. 

Sansa will marry Tyrion and the hound will chill with them (if he's alive)



Deaths: 
Cersie
Rhaegal
Drogon 
John or Daenerys (not both)
The Mountain (eventually)
Arya (hopefully not)
Brienne or Tormund (not both)
Jorah (if the whole greyscale thing is wrong)
Red woman
Euron
Reek (hopefully)",5,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

1039,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-2-14,2018,2,14,23,7xi7y9,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] How I think it all ends.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7xi7y9/everything_how_i_think_it_all_ends/,TaraTinker19,1518617273,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible as my mind will probably change as it always does, and since there are many clues coming out. I'm making this theory based on clues from the ""leaked scripts"", set photos, etcetera. Also some clues I've picked up on upon my re-watch. I could include everything I believe will happen, but I wont to make this as short as I can. I don't necessarily want these thing to come true but there is a good possibility for some of them if not all.
  

So here it is. People say there is no time for certain things to happen but there is plenty of time. for the great war to start right away leaves no time for anything else accept hours of aftermath. So the last season will take place over the course of 9 months in my opinion. Jon and Danny return and everyone reunites. Bran knows Danny is pregnant, and chooses to keep his parentage a secret for now along with Sam. Jamie shows up around the same time and tells them Cersie has betrayed them. Also the Northern Lords choose not to bend the knee for Danny, and they need them. Jon leaves and goes to kings landing to talk with Cersie one last time, and she arrests him. Word gets back to Danny who has discovered she's pregnant and she chooses to stay at Winterfell with Tyrion, Bran, Sansa, and the others. Jamie, Brianne, the Hound, Gendry, Arya, and Pod, travel to kinds landing to try and negotiate with Cersie one last time and free Jon.


 Sansa knows they need to north on their side to help win the war so she takes it upon herself to travel to the Veil to negotiate with the lords. She marries Robyn in order to forge a lasting alliance, but its not all bad for Sansa because he is handsome and a good warrior in recent years. It will show a good bit of traveling from Jamie's crew, which I think Brianne will continue to keep her affection for Jamie a secret but it will eat at her the whole time. I also think, this is when Arya and Gendry's romantic relationship will start to form, and I think she will train him a little along the way. first seeing Jon, and then being reunited with everyone she cares about, makes for a happier Arya. They need to fill some time in the show with some comic relief, love, and dialog, so I believe this is how it will be done. They will be attacked by a bunch of Whights, they fight them off but Pod dies. All of the traveling everyone has to do, will give the show enough time for Danny to carry for 9 months, and that I believe will be the length of the whole season as I mentioned.


 They finally arrive at kings landing, I'm not sure if Europe and the Gold company has already arrived or not. Just to be short, Jamie will kill Cersie like the prophecy, then the mountain will kill Jamie with brianne holding him as he's dying, they both will confess their love, and then he will die ""in the arms of the woman he loves"" like he said he wanted to in season 5. We think its Cersie but its really Brianne, (plot twist) meanwhile the hound and Arya will fight the mountain. The Mountain will injure the hound and Brianne will come in and kill him, defending the hound and avenging Jamie. The hound will beg Arya to kill him again to put him out of Misery and she will. But he will die with more honor and peace then he ever did. They free Jon, and Brianne, Arya, and Gendry head back to Winterfell with him. 

Soon after they leave The Gold Company and Euron show up if they aren't already there like I mentioned. The Night king also shows up with his Army they will burn and kill everyone in kings landing, the lanister army, Euron and the Gold Company, and destroy all of the structures. Winter has come and with it brings snow fall. The Night King will fly over the map room and see Cersie, and bring her back as the Night Queen. He has his army, plus her and her new army of the dead. They head to winterfell where everything will go down. Like I said to make a long story short, and obviously there is going to be so many plots to go on in the midst of all of this, but this I think it's the general idea based on what I've watched and spoilers i've pieced together.


By the time they get back to kings landing the battle will start immediately, no time for chatting, Winterfell will be the place the final battle of the series will take place. everyone is fighting. And cerise brings along wildfire along with the Night kings dragon fire. Winterfell is on fire at this point. I think Gendry will die in battle. While all of this is happening Danny is in the tower giving birth Paralleling the tower of joy. The tower bran climbed in season 1 and was in much of his dreams, and the tallest tower sansa put a candle in to be rescued. Ghost and Nymeria show up at the battle at some point. Arya will kill whight Cersie with the catspaw dagger completing her list once and for all, and John comes face to face with the Knight king. Jon is struggling with him, but right before the Night king kills Jon Brand shoots a dragon glass arrow into the the night Kings heart killing him, and every other wight in Winterfell. Possibly Arya tries to shoot him and missed this time only for Bran to finally hit the target. It could go either way really. The clues of this are layed out in the first time we see bran in season 1. He's trying to hit the target and cant, and he has a vision in season 3 ep 2 of Jon and Rob in the woods tellin him to relax his bow arm and he misses again. Arya is last seen in season 3 ep 6 practicing shooting it what looks like the same woods as brans dream. She hits the target everything but is shown another way to shoot that contradicks how she was always told. She never gets a chance to shoot that last arrow. I think the point to that scene is she will most likely try to shoot the new way and fail leaving room for Bran to finally Hit his target.  Arya and Bran shooting arrows is not done much throughout the series but that bit in the beginning was enough to give us this surprise at the end. This could also be why the dragon glass is perfect size to be made into an arrow. It would be nice to rewatch the series when its all done and see that opening scene like, wow this is how it all ends and they've shown us right here all along. I've not really seen the shooting of the arrow theory so I'll take full credit for this one.


 Jon goes up to the tower to find danny dying, and she gives a baby girl to Jon and makes him promise to take care of her. She dies, and Winterfell burns down. In the after math, everything is beginning to be rebuilt. Bron gets his castle. Tyrion will retire as lord of casterly rock. Sansa will rebuild winterfell just like she was doing in the snow at the veil, and she will rule it with brianne as her guard, along with her husband ruling the Veil if he doesn't die in battle. She got what she wanted in life but is more humbled because of everything she went through. Arya has finished her list and got her family back but after all shes seen, and the fact Gendry is dead there is nothing left for her to do so she will sail off to see whats west of westeros but somehow she is content enough to be happy traveling. Everyone will possibly see her off at sea. Bran will go to the tree and live out his years as the Three eyed Raven. Jon will rule the 7 kingdoms and live out his days making everything better. Davos will be his hand. There will be no more wall or no more Nights watch. No more dragons, no more wights, just a normal world. I think bravos will forgive all debt of the throne not sure why maybe because of Arya, and I think Jaquen controls all of Bravos and is the Many faced God/Syrio. Don't have an end game for the red witch, Jorah, Varys and Theon to comment on. They will probably all die, with Jorah dying for Danny in some way. Theon possibly dying after killing Euron. Or living out his days at the Iron Islands. The last shot we will see is Sam reading the story to little same like old nan read to Bran, and when we closes the book the series will end. 

It's just what I think as of now. My mind could change a lot and has changed a lot, but with recent spoilers, and foreshadowing, this is what I got so far. This is not how I want it to end at all. (I want Arya to be queen of the Seven kingdoms with Gendry by her side because he will be revealed to be the secret son of Cersie and Robert.) but I'm to tired at this point to go into what I want to happed for everyone. So that's all I will say. Hope it all made sense, I typed fast and didn't go back and fix my grammar",36,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

On killing the Night King, Jaime has Widow's Wail to kill him. I found it odd that the show did not make it a point to show that he had it. The show DID make it a point to show that Arya has the Catspaw dagger, Brienne has Oathkeeper, Sam has Heartsbane, and Jon has Longclaw. People have to look closely at him during season 7 to see Widow's Wail, otherwise, it could still be believed that it was buried with Joffrey. If there is an emphasis on Valyrian steel objects because they can kill White Walkers, then why no emphasis on Widow's Wail? Now I don't know if he would kill him in one on one combat, or if he would see an opportunity and take it like he did when he tried to kill Daenerys. But if he killed the Night King he would be able to restore his honor after killing the Mad King. People might still call him ""King Slayer"" but maybe this time they would mean it as the killing the Night King and not the Mad King. But if Jaime killed Cersei, he would not restore his honor. People hated the Mad King and what he did as ruler. Jaime killing him should have been seen as a good thing but it wasn't, and he became known as Kingslayer. If he killed Cersei he would be known as a King AND Queen Slayer. The negative opinion of him would continue, and potentially be even worse because he would be killing a ruler again and this time it would be his own sister. If he does not kill her then I do not know who will, nor will I speculate who will; that is not the purpose of this post. Now I know the Valonqar, and maybe even the Azor Ahai, theory could be used as a basis for believing Jaime will kill Cersei, and it would make more sense if the Night King is killed by Jon. But I think if Jaime killed the Night King it would make for a better overall story. Also, I personally believe Jaime is the best developed character of the series. I strongly disliked him in the first few seasons. But after confessing to Brienne, finding a peaceful solution at Riverrun, and leaving Cersei to go North and fight my opinion of him has done a complete 180. From being hated by viewers and characters in the show, to being the one who saves Westeros from its greatest danger, Jaime will be redeemed and his honor will be restored. 

TLDR: It would make more sense for Jaime to kill the Night King than Cersei. Killing Cersei would only continue his King, and now Queen, Slayer moniker, but killing the Night King would restore his honor. ",31,71,False,spoiler,,,,,

The final battle will take place in Winterfell. 

John comes face to face with the Knight king. Jon is struggling with him, but right before the Night king kills Jon Brand shoots a dragon glass arrow into the the night Kings heart killing him, which will then kill every other wight in Winterfell. Arya possibly tries to shoot him and missed this time only for Bran to finally hit the target. It could go either way really. The clues of this are layed out in the first time we see bran in season 1. He's trying to hit the target and cant, and he has a vision in season 3 ep 2 of Jon and Rob in the woods tellin him to relax his bow arm and he misses again. Arya is last seen in season 3 ep 6 practicing shooting in what looks like the same woods as brans dream, its certainly color graded the same. She hits the target everytime but is shown another way to shoot that contradicts how she was always told. She argues about it. She never gets a chance to shoot that last arrow to see if it worked. I think the point to that scene is she will most likely try to shoot the new way and fail leaving room for Bran to finally Hit his target. At the beginning Ned was standing on the loft looking down with Caitlyn at Bran, Then Bran is in the same spot looking down with the Three eyed Raven, then we see Sansa and Little finger looking down on Arya and Brieanne, then we see Sansa and Arya looking down talking about how Ned used to watch her shoot arrows. I believe one of them could possibly be standing there when it happens. The courtyard of Winterfell is the first thing we saw, and it will be where it all ends. Arya and Bran shooting arrows is not done much throughout the series but that bit in the beginning was enough to give us this surprise at the end. This could also be why the dragon glass is perfect size to be made into an arrow. There are probably so many other hints towards this theory if you guys want to look further into it. I just had time to show a few clues but its enough to be legit in my opinion. 

It would be nice to rewatch the series when its all done and see that opening scene like, wow this is how it all ends and they've shown us right here all along. I've not really seen the shooting of the arrow theory so I'll take full credit for this one.",13,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Maybe he'll use obsidian AND valyrian steel to pierce his heart (in contrast to only obsidian used to create the first WW/NK in Bran's flashback)? Then, dead-John will raise an undead army of his own (using casualties from a climactic battle that he will lose as Alive King in the North), an ice dragon of his own (perhaps dead-Rheagal), and possibly even dead-Ghost to fight the evil NK/undead army. Additionally, I also think John might raise the dead kings of winter laying in rest in the crypts of Winterfell who may serve as skinny, skeletal generals in his new dead-army (complete with ancient Stark swords, armor and maybe crowns from their crypts.) Of course, he and his army will win and John will kill the NK. Perhaps, then Daenaerys will mercifully and climactically kill John with Longclaw or dragon's breath so John doesn't have to spend eternity being half un-dead and Dany will win the game of thrones!

So I think Euron next season after he brings the Golden Company to Cersei at some point will betray Cersei (Weather he kills her himself on there wedding night or Jaime or Arya do it for him) and then after he betrays her will take the throne and declare himself King of the Seven Kingdoms (with Qyburn, The Mountain, and the Iron Bank changing sides immediately afterwards (changing sides to Euron if your wondering)).

I think this will happen because it is obvious Euron has a bigger plan especially with his fascination for Dragons and the fact he wants the throne. So I think he will like I said betray Cersei, Take the throne, then afterwards focus his attention on Dany and her dragons, Maybe he will even be the final conflict of the series.

This does not bode well for the young woman as the POV characters of GRRMs prologues dont generally outlive the chapter. However, just because GRRM has said that Jeyne Westerling will appear in the prologue does not mean she is the POV character. But where was Jeyne last? As readers we arent entirely sure and from the sample chapters of the Winds of Winter already released we can see POV characters opening in places we didnt explain them, e.g. Theon in Stannis camp, Aeron as Eurons prisoner.

I believe the prologue will follow the Blackfish and the pregnant Jeyne as they journey towards the Eyrie. At first it will seem that Jeyne is carrying Robbs child and they fled Riverrun to protect the potential heir to the North. The POV character will reflect on how they hoped to remain at Riverrun so Jeyne could give birth and reappear into the Game of Thrones holding the heir of Robb Stark in her arms which would, in theory, rally the lords of the North and the Riverlands. However, due to the Siege of Riverrun the plan had to be altered and the Blackfish decides that the Eyrie is the safest place for them to go as it is one of the places in Westeros out of the Lannisters reach. However, all is not as it seems.

The last time we meet Jeyne (Jaime VII - A Feast for Crows) we actually meet a doppelganger or stand-in for Jeyne. Jeyne has escaped with the Blackfish, and her mother, Sybell Spicer plays along with the ruse to protect herself and her family. That is the surprise relocation of Jeyne's character like Aeron and Theon.  

We discover through the course of the chapter that Jeyne is not carrying the child of Robb Stark. Jeyne was either not pregnant at the time of his death or the child was forcibly aborted by Jeynes mother. But how could this be? Simple, the father of Jeynes unborn child is not Robb, but is the Blackfish himself. And this would not be out of character with GRRMs writing style as he portrays a character in a certain way and over time we discover the opposite to be true, for example: Jaime or the Hound as villains in the early stages of the story and altering into fame favourites; Jon as a sullen boy to a strong, empathetic leader; or Arya as a cute tomboy to assassin. However, here we are seeing a devout bachelor on the verge of becoming a father. But why? Out of love for Jeyne? Probably not  but out of duty and loyalty. I believe the Blackfish is a sensible man and he recognises that the Northern cause needs a new king and with none at hand he decides to make his own. Then when the child is born lie about his/her age and say its Robbs. 

However, this plot will only last until the end of the chapter with the death of Jeyne Westerling and her unborn child, and the Blackfish if he is the POV character, perhaps at the hands of the Lannisters or Freys. However, if the Blackfish survives the chapter this will lead to a crossroads in his character with one potential road continuing onto the Eyrie to enter the Sansa/ Littlefinger plot and another road calling him back to the Riverlands and perhaps the Brotherhood Without Banners.

I suppose there is some evidence to this being possible from the show, after all, GRRM decision to kill Talisa in the show seems to show that her character is not a character he intends to include in the end game and therefore he will kill her off in the first chapter of the next book.

And after the Red Wedding, the Blackfishs plot leads to the Siege of Riverrun but without Jeyne/Talisa the Blackfish has nothing to escape Riverrun for in terms of the plot. Whereas, His character is not at a potential crossroads, he is at a dead-end and in the world of Game of Thrones and a Song of Ice and Fire that is when you end up dead.

Really, there seems to be so much going on that needs some sort of resolution I fear that season 8 may feel and rushed. I imagine they will need setups and death scenes for nearly all the main characters. We need closure on, well who have we got.. Jon, Arya, Nymeria, Sansa, Bran, Sam, the Hound, the Mountain, Cersie, Jamie, Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys,  Brienne, Podrick, Jorah, Theon, Yara, Melisandre, Bronn, Missandei, Greyworm, Gendry, Tormund, Gilly, Davos, Meera, Beric, 3 dragons, several white walkers and the Night King. That is at least 5 main character's dispositions per episode. That is a character dropping every 10 minutes (20 mins if they actually do run with 2 hr episodes)
Is there even going to be time for a story between deaths? They are going to have to spend some quality time with with Bran the 3 eyed raven too.

Season 5 Episode 10, Jon dies. 100%, stone-cold dead, his watch ends, etc. Therefore, when he's revived in Season 6, he *technically* is not longer part of the Night's Watch. This is well-established when he says he's no longer bound by his vow because he already gave his life for the Watch.

So then...when he died, if he isn't part of the Watch anymore, he's technically not Lord Commander anymore. Yet he immediately executes all the people that killed him as if he's still in power, then he just walks out. Then, all of a sudden, Dolorous Edd becomes Lord Commander when there's no election or anything.

This may just be a case of ""de jure"" versus ""de facto"" -- the idea that Jon just took advantage of being in power, backed by the Wildlings, to get revenge on his killers, and that Edd became Lord Commander because the Watch is so destitute and formalities are ignored, but for some reason this bothered me. Jon really had no right to execute those men as if he was Lord Commander, then walk directly out of Castle Black as if he's released from his vows. It's one or the other.",56,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

Look, it makes sense, I get it, but gosh thats just such lazy writing. Im not going to let that ruin the show for me but its so stupid and such a lazy way to beat the white walkers. Thats something directly out of so many blockbuster films like The Avengers, and its okay there because thats a fun popcorn romp, so is GOT but I just expected more...creativity, rather than the good ol trope of destroy one source and the whole army dies. Its just a very easy solution. 

Does anyone else dislike this as much as me? Its just that through the whole show I think we were all wondering how will they beat the WW? That massive army of the dead is coming and everyone they kill becomes new recruits, how can they hope to stop that? Its something that made them scary, so when they said kill the Night King and they all die it just became oh so thats how theyll beat them, got it. haha. ",53,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if Dany succeeds, she takes the Iron Throne, but is dissatisfied with it and forges her own bigger Throne? It would be a cool nod to the bigger books version and a nice callback to Aegon, the last Targaryen to successfully conquer the seven kingdoms.

I noticed something interesting while rewatching season one...",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7xyro0/main_spoilers_in_regards_to_characters/,PoderickPayne,1518788354,"Episode 1x08.  We see Catelyn Stark arguing with her sister in the Eyrie.  Later that same episode we next see Catelyn arriving at Robb's war camp in the Riverlands.  Meanwhile we first see Tyrion and Bronn taken captive by the Hill Tribes, in the Vale.  Later that same episode we next see them all arriving at Tywin's camp that had to be even further away than Robb's

Did anyone make a giant stink about ""how did they get there that fast???!!!"" back then, or did we just assume the correct passage of time had gone by?

I'm sure there are other examples of this sort of thing in the first few seasons.  I wasn't looking for it, until I just happened to notice it in episode 8.  And I think it exemplifies an unfair impulse some people have to crap on Beniof and Wiesse whenever they can for anything they do that's beyond the books.  Even if it means treating things like the show cutting out travel scenes to move the story along, as if it's something they haven't been doing all along

Heck now that I think of it, wasn't the very first time we saw Jaime in Cersei in Kings Landing, at Jon Aryn's funeral?  Then later that same episode, the next time we see them is Winterfell?  I mean that was episode 1x01 for crying out loud.  It's not teleporting, it's moving things along, IMO.  I mean I guess they could throw in text on the screen, or a narrator saying things like ""3 weeks later...."" but does anyone really want that?  Plus it could never work when you have so many different storylines happening at different paces

1) Saved by Tyrion against nights watch bullies, who were pissed he humiliated them with his arms skills

2) Tricked by Ygritte and captured by Wildlings

3) Breaks oath against being with women by sleeping with Ygritte 

4) Bested by Karl in crasters keep, saved by one of crasters wives 

5) Possibly saved by Olly when Ygritte might have killed him

6) Saved by Stannis when trying to assassinate Mance Rayder

7) Killed by the nights watch and resurrected by melisandra 

8) Decides to attack Winterfell while outnumbered, saved by Littlefinger

9) Goes on suicide mission to capture a white walker, becomes surrounded. Saved by Dany and her dragons

10) Doesn't hop on dragon, gets left behind and is about to get killed by white walkers when Uncle Benjen randomly saves him

11) Ruins possible treaty talks with Cersei by saying he serves Dany. Peace talks saved by Tyrion. 

I think you all get the picture. He makes tons of bad decision and is bailed out by other characters. And this is the rightful heir to the throne?",44,50,False,spoiler,,,,,

My theory (what I think would be fun and fulfilling) is that Dany, Jon and crew are fighting the army of the dead and are about to lose and all of a sudden Euron and the Golden Company (and potentially Second Sons to see some Dario) show up and turn the tide of battle.  The living win and when questioned about it, Euron says it has something to do with a deal Tyrion made with Cersei.  We can see scheming and everyone upset with Tyrion or whatever you want here.

While they are having a feast and celebrating the victory, Euron and the Golden Company plan on having a Red Wedding type event to eliminate all of Cersei's enemies.  However, (choose one or all) never trust sell swords to keep a secret, Jamie and Tyrion knew what Tywin did, or Sansa and Arya know what happened to their family; Dany, Jon, and Crew are suspicious and when this is about to play out they take the Golden Company prisoner (or kill them) during the feast.  Part one of Cersei not being as smart as she thinks she is.

When she hears that her plan was foiled and her army taken prisoner/ defeated she goes to the Iron Bank for a loan to get even more mercenaries.  However, she is told that she has already paid off her debt in full (with the gold from Highgarden) and that they have no reason to back the losing side.  Part two of Cersei not being as smart as she thinks she is.

With her back against the wall, Cersei goes crazy and plans to blow up King's Landing and Jaimie sneaks in (with Bronn's help), confronts her, and she admits it and he kills her to prevent the destruction of King's Landing..... Again

The Stark children obviously have many connections and similarities to their direwolves. I believe here GRRM is foreshadowing Brans future as the Three-eyed Raven with the line with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see

While that description fits simply, the description of Shaggydog really caught my eye. His fur had darkened until he was black, and his eyes were green fire. Assuming GRRM was using these descriptions to foreshadow the future of the Stark boys, this sounds ominous. The first thing that came to mind was an image of Rickon burnt black with wildfire (the only green fire I know). Could Rickon meet a crispy end in Wildfire? Lemme know what you guys think

How should these be divided amongst the six episodes? 

My gut reaction is 2-2-2. I could see E1 either starting or ending with the dead sacking a village north of Winterfell. But I don't know if two episodes allows enough build before major battles. At the same time I don't know that I'd *want* more than two episodes of Northern lords hemming and hawing over who is the rightful heir or Tormund making faces at Brienne while she makes faces at Jamie or a montage of dragon class mining or Sansa doing whatever it is exactly that she'll be doing.

Vary's gives one of the best insights into his character when he approaches him. Tryion defends himself saying he can't control Dany's mind and its not his fault.

Vary's shows a part of himself rarely seen only shown when he apologises to Ned in the dungeons. He says that what the Mad King did haunts him, and no matter how many times he tries to desperately convince himself it wasn't his fault he can't. He went through this ideology under the 'Mad King' that he was just 'following orders' and its pretty clear its messed him up. 

Vary's tells Tryion that as 'Hand' of a King or a Queen its HIS job to make the ruler rule properly.  Not like he (Varys) did which was blindly following orders or how Ned did which was basically being buddies with Robert. Even  can be seen as lambasting Tyrion's previous role as Hand which was basically Tyrion getting his own back on people.

As a Hand you have to be the person who tells the King or Queen ""FUCK NO! THIS IS WHAT YOU DO!"" or ""FUCK NO! THIS IS WRONG!"", A good Hand can be the friend of the monarch but they also MUST be someone who can call them out and make them change.

Vary's is right when he says Dany can be a great ruler and he is also right when  he says Tyrion needs to show her the way and stop drinking and pretending he can do nothing.

- NK circle back around to destroy the rest of the wall (or some WW's still behind destroy it similar to how NK broke the force field around 3 Eyed Raven's cave/tree), With Beric and Tormund escaping while Edd and the Night's Watch stay and have the wall fall on them.

- Gendry had left prior to the Eastwatch destruction and reunites with Arya and we get a bounding scene between the two.

- Jon and Dany arrive and we get reunions between Jon and Sam, Ghost, Gendry, and The Stark children. As well as a Hound/Sansa reunion, Tyrion/Sansa reunion, Arya/The Hound reunion, and a Jorah/Lyanna reunion.

- Beric and Tormund arrive. Jaime, Bronn, and Edmure arrive with an Army made up of Edmure's forces and 300 or so Sellswords from the Westerlands after they helped Edmure (who had escape from the Twins) take back Riverrun, and Jaime has a reunion with Brienne while Bronn has his reunion with Pod.

- Jon starts preparations for the battle against the dead, Though the Northerners (with the exception of Bran and Howland Reed (oh he shows up by the way)) are not happy with Jon bending the knee including Sansa and even in a twist Arya whom still respects Dany and still loves Jon but does not support Jon bending the knee. Anyways they do prep well but not enough to make a solid plan by the time the WW's get near.

- Cersei has a miscarriage and goes more mad, Euron arrives with the GC and sends him with the GC to sack it for it's food supplies and sends Daario and the Second Sons (who is revealed to have betrayed Dany) to take Dragonstone, Euron gives Damphair and Yara the Forsaken treatment.

- Jon is informed that Karhold, Last Hearth, Hold of House Glover, and Bear Island are destroyed making Lyanna and Jorah the last of there kind and houses Glover, Karstark, and Umber extinct.

- Howland arrives to help Sam and Bran confirm Jon's parentage, Once Jon learns the truth he has so many mixed emotions on it, Jon tells Dany and they get into a conflict especially when it is revealed Dany's pregnant, However before it can be settled the battle begins, Bran and Howland leave to the God's eye shortly before the battle.

- The battle is brutal as it results in the deaths of Tormund, Bronn, Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce, and most of the Dothraki, Unsullied, and Northern Soldiers and Lords. Wagons containing citizens leave to Eyrie or Riverrun, Euron along with Harry Strickland and the GC surprise attack WF killing the soldiers left there to help the citizens leave and destroying any wagons that did not leave in time before they arrived and killing the people in them (including poor sweet little Robin), Dany arrives with Drogon and burns some of the GC and gets anyone still stuck in WF out of there.

- Harry Strickland notices the NK on his Ice Dragon right behind Dany and has his men fallback to Euron's dismay after they sack WF and burn it too the ground, Harry also gives Euron smack for killing the unarmed citizens, Arya saves Gendry from two WW's only for them including Beric and Jorah to be captured by the Golden Company, Varys is also captured as well.

- After Jon, Dany, and co. make it back to Riverrun they send Jaime, Brienne, Pod, and the Hound to KL to deal with Cersei and get Arya, Gendry, Jorah, and Beric back, With Jaime going to get some Clansmen from the Vale Tyrion knew.

- Meanwhile Gendry dies in his cell but Beric in secret gives him the kiss of life (harry and some GC are the first to return by the way), Arya uses his faceless men skills and she along with Gendry escape promising to Jorah and Varys they will come back for them, Arya and Gendry go into hiding in KL (they have admitted there feelings for each other at this point and have hooked up).

- Jon and Dany leave before the GC attack Riverrun in a nick of time with almost no one getting killed, Dany gives birth to twins at the Eyrie and Jon and Dany rekindle there love. 

- Arya and Gendry sneak out of the city and meet up with Jaime and co. once they arrive, Arya using her FM skills again open the front gates allowing Timett and his Clansmen to make a distraction while Jaime and the others sneak in through the sewers. Arya gets Jorah out of the black cells as promised (Varys was executed in front of the Citizens along with Damphair), Cleganebowl happens with the Hound winning but dying afterwards due to blood lose, Cersei drops the bombshell of Gendry being her true son, Arya almost kills her but at the last minute chooses Justice over Vengeance and let's Jaime take the kill.

- Harry Strickland changes sides after hearing that Gendry is the true Heir of House Baratheon, Jaime afterwards has Harry and Timett send some GC and Clansmen to help evacuate along with Arya, Gendry, Jorah, and Pod while Brienne chooses to stay with Jaime to find the wildfire. Dany rides on Drogon to KL after hearing that the NK is near.

- Dany and Drogon are killed by the NK and his Ice Dragon in the skies above KL, Jon rides to the God's eye and learns his father Rhaegar is AA/TPTWP with Jon being Lightbringer. Also the NK has return due to Jon's birth and also to end the curse the children put on them. Jon fights the NK one on one and defeats him as all the Wights collapse and the WW's are about to break apart Jon puts Dragonglass into his heart and becoming the new NK, He touches one of the Weirwoods and with help from Bran ends the curse and the WW's along with Jon turn human again.

- The wildfire goes off and Jaime, Brienne, Harry, Qyburn, the Little Birds, The Wights, Sept Unella, Rhaegal, and any citizen that did not make it out in time are consumed by it (but this happens prior to the NK's death). In the aftermath Jon with Bran leaves to live the rest of there days with the now turned human WW's, Sansa is made Queen of the North and marries Pod with Pod taking the Stark name, Timett is made Lord of the Vale, Edmure is made Lord of the Riverlands, Tyrion Lord of the Westerlands, Another Sand Snake Lady of Dorne, New houses Lords of Pyke and Stormlands, Sam and Gilly Lord and Lady of the Reach and raising Jon and Dany's twins, And Arya and Gendry are made King and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms (with Davos as hand and Jorah as Lord Commander of the City Watch) but different kings and queens as the Throne is melted down (by the wildfire) and a Proto-Democratic Government is established (or atleast hints of it).

Now for some quick notes I want to give.

- Illyn Payne along with the Brave Companions are with the GC when the attack Riverrun only to find it empty and are killed by the NK when he arrives there with his army.

- Daario on his way with the Second Sons to take Dragonstone Theon after coming back from Pyke learning of Euron's lie attacks Daario's fleet and he surrenders as the Second Sons are forced to change sides, Theon with his fleet made up of some Ironborn from the Finale, Ironborn from Pyke, and the Second Sons still waiting at Dorne attack Euron and his fleet made up of Pro-Euron Ironborn and the GC. Theon kills Euron by putting an arrow through his eye but Cersei has Balistae's laced with Wildfire fired at the ships killing most forces on both sides including Theon, Yara, and Daario (making House Greyjoy extinct).

- Mel returns to Volantis on to leave and question her deeds and believes as she is disgusted by the Red Priest and how they said that Shireen's burning was for the good when she knows it was wrong and that Stannis died anyway, She sports Rag like Ropes and Joins Bran in the God's Eye only for her along with Howland to be killed by the NK.

- Jon's twins are named Rhaegar the II and Arya the I Targaryen.

- I was going to have Sansa die but I felt that would make her arc pointless, and I was going to have Jon sit the throne but I feel he and Dany are too obvious.",25,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

:--|:--|:--|:--
4|Nov. 2013|April 2014|~3.5 months
5|Dec. 2014|April 2015|~3.5 months 
6|Dec. 2015|April 2016|~4 months
7|Feb. 2017|July 2016|~5 months

Season 5 came out approximately a year and a week after Season 4, and Season 6 came out approximately a year and a week. 

I discounted the production schedules of the earlier seasons because I thought it wouldn't be as pertinent, given how the scale of the show has grown exponentially since the end of season 3. Production for season 8 is slated to end in July, and HBO has confirmed that the series will be released in 2019. Given the pattern we have seen above, I predict that it will be released sometime in February 2019.

This timing, also, would probably fit with the themes of the show. We all know that G.R.R.M's second to last book in the series is called ""The Winds of Winter"" and the final book is called ""A Dream of Spring."" As of now, Spring 2019 officially begins around 3/20/2019. So, given that we have six episodes in season 9, tracking back from that date, I believe that the Season 8 Premiere will be either on 2/10/2019 or 2/17/2019, and will end either on 3/17/2019 or 3/24/2019.

This would allow the story told over the six episodes to transition from ""winter"" into ""spring"", the events in the story mirroring the weather transition for much of the world. (sorry, Australia)

Sam gets back to Winterfell. The White Walkers besiege Winterfell. Since the Starks in Winterfell don't know how to defeat the White Walkers, they get Bran to look back through time to the last time they were defeated. 

Bran looks back to the first battle of the Night's King, where winter fell. He sees his ancestors use the Horn of Winter as a weapon somehow. Bran describes the horn to Sam, who says ""funny you should mention that"", and pulls out the Horn of Winter from his rucksack, explaining that he found it with the dragon glass at the Fist of the First Men, but that it was broken. So Bran goes back through time again to see how it was broken. 

Bran sees Bran the Breaker go to destroy the Horn of Winter, and wargs into him to stop him, but fails to and the horn is still broken. While this is going on in the past, the Battle for Winterfell is going on in the present. The Night King in the present somehow severs Bran's link to the Weirwood tree, and Bran's consciousness is stuck back in Bran the Breaker's body permanently. In the past, Bran the Breaker then becomes Bran the Builder, founder of House Stark. 

Bran builds Winterfell, the Wall, and everything else knowing that they'll need them to defend against the White Walkers in thousands of years. He is the origin of the Stark words: Winter is Coming. He has kids, he goes around raising Castles and learning what he can from the Children of the Forest, as they are still alive back then. He buries the Horn of Winter and some dragon glass at the Fist of he First Men. 

Bran the Builder has a falling out with the Children of the Forest, goes to war with them, and they kidnap his eldest son and use him to create a weapon to use against him... the Night King!

Bran the Builder works out how to pass his consciousness on through memory in the Weirwood trees, teaches one of his sons or grandson's how to do it, and then eventually dies after spending years at the base of a Weirwood tree, letting it grow into him like the last Three-eyed Raven did. The tree grows over him and he becomes a face on the tree. His son or grandson or who he taught how to do it taps into the Weirwood, has access to his Bran's memories through the trees (among everything else), and becomes the first Three-eyed Raven.

He knows that, if everyone sees him fight, some will realize that there is no way he would have beaten Arthur Dayne. At this point Ned defeating Dayne is basically a legend, particularly in the North. Everyone knows what an incredible swordsman Dayne was. While Ned is good, he I nowhere near the same skill level of Arthur Dayne. Bran says this himself while watching the two fight... If Ned were to fight in a tournament it would get people questioning how he beat Arthur Dayne in the first place. This would get them thinking about the Tower of Joy, which is the last thing Ned wants to be on people's minds...

Why does Sansa assume she knows Arya? They literally haven't seen each other since Season 1. They've each had transformative experiences that have completely changed their character and outlook, and it seems pretty clearly evident in their other conversations. Unless Sansa was trying to throw Baelish for a loop, the Arya - Sansa relationship in Season 7 makes little sense.

1. Starting in no order Arya would still see (like the other Northerners) Dany as the Mad King's granddaughter I.E the man who killed her grandfather and Uncle.

2. Arya would also have a problem with Varys being there as she saw her in the tombs of KL and also if Jon and Bran forgive Jaime.

3. Jon may also try to make Arya stay in WF and not fight due to him maybe being alittle overprotective for obvious reasons.

4. Really think about it from Arya's POV (Ironically) if she found out Jon was king and to find out she gave it to a foreign woman she never even met and also is the granddaughter of a mad man she would be furious and could see her relationship with Jon as taking Jon away from the Wolfpack, Yes I think like Sansa she could grow to like Dany more but personally I think she will still have a problem with Jon bending the knee.

I felt this small moment had an emotional impact to it for a few reasons. First off, I can't remember one time in the show where someone was against the idea of Tyrion doing something dangerous that he could die. Nobody has been as overprotective of him as Dany has. Despite the mistakes he made in Season 7, she wasn't giving up on him and still needs him.

It was also her choice of words too that really stood out; ""I didn't come all this way, to have my Hand murdered."" She has lost loved ones she cared about on her journey to get back to Westeros, had just came back from losing her child beyond the Wall, and now she's possibly going to lose her close friend, someone she has formed a very special bond with. They had their troubles, but underneath all of that she still deeply loves and cares about him to the point where he is like family to her. 

Tyrion didn't want everything they went through to try and get help from Cersei for the Great War by showing proof that the WWs exist to be for nothing, so if he had to risk dying especially since this was his idea, then so be it. Because if he didn't at least try, then 'they're right back where they started.', it was so sweet that Dany didn't want that from him. But she understood, respected and appreciated that, so she reluctantly accepted he had to do this. The only good thing that really came out of it, was that at least with Tyrion getting Cersei to publicly promise to help, this won Jaime over to his side and now has valuable information on what Cersei is really planning.

This moment I also felt really mirrored the scene where Tyrion begged her not to go to Eastwatch, only this moment felt a little more powerful because at least we see that their feelings are mutual. They're both very protective of one another from being hurt, and can't stand the thought of one of them dying. I love how the show handled filming both scenes, where they kept the cameras focus on both Dany and Tyrion in the two separate scenes as they watch the other leave.",17,24,False,spoiler,,,,,

Characters suffered the consequences for their decisions and felt the weight of their choices. Storylines were developed and crafted very carefully with care and consistency. The world was brutal and unforgiving plus the nature of the political strife had a very real effect on the 7 kingdoms. 

Seasons 5-7 has become dumbed down. like there being absolutely zero political ramifications for Cersei killing the tyrells and the high sept plus tons of innocent people. Or the death of little finger being an absolute travesty in the way it was executed( he doesnt demand a trial by combat? He doesnt mention the lack of evidence in all of Sansas accusations? He doesnt hall ass once bran repeats the chaos is a ladder line back to him? He is a lord, does he not have the right to demand a proper trial? Just awful)  or Sansa keeping the army of the vale a secret from John Snow without any consequences for their relationship? Or Tyrion of all people suggesting that they should kidnap a wight in order to convince Cersei to help in the battle against the night king even though he knows how she deceitful she is and the only assurance they have is her word? Also characters like Tyrion,Varys and Petyr have all been incredibly dumbed down, its like the writers dont know what to do with them

I really hope they dont release season 8 until they have really through the storyline and make everything believable but I doubt thats gonna happen 

Im just a little disappointed that the prime of this show is over and now theyre very clearly just going through the motions in order to finish it off. Not how I imagined this show would end.",102,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Weve often discussed the and now his watch is ended and that Jons death and subsequent resurrection released him from his Nights Watch oath and sets him up to be king.

But what happens to the Nights Watch if the foes they were founded to combat are wiped out? And the wall that is their post is gone?

*IF* (and I realize its an if) the WW are all defeated and Jon remains alive, what is to stop him as king (or queens consort even) from having the brothers of the NW released from their oaths because their reason for being is now over?

Suddenly the roasting of the Tarlys is more than just an example of Danys ruthlessness. Sams position restored, he could re-take House Tarly.

Okay so why would Bronn be a Bolton didn't that house have a history of being violent and liking Torture, Well yes but I think with Bronn it could be a Ugly Duckling story as in he is not like the others. In this case Bronn may not have been as violent or extreme as his brother Roose or his Nephew Ramsey and we know he is not a Rapist and knows no means no (atleast I hope he does), Okay so now for actual evidence...Well I don't have a lot but I have some for one it explains why he is at the Wall in a sense, Him not revealing who he is could because to protect himself as there are some out there who my want to kill something with the last name Bolton, We don't know much about House Bolton, and Finally he does kindof look like a Northern.

This is a common phrase/saying repeated over and over throughout the GoT series to another individual that you know will be facing certain war(s) for his very survival in the near future. Mance Rayder said it to Stannis Baratheon at Castle Black before being sentenced to death. Ser Arthur Dayne said it to Edward Stark before their battle at the Tower of Joy. John Snow said it to Daenerys Targaryen before leaving on his expedition North beyond the Wall to capture a wight. Yet, if you notice Benjens last interaction with Bran Stark, Benjen begins saying I wish you good fortune... then stops in his tracks and never finishes the phrase/saying. Instead, Benjen just stares intensely at Bran for a few moments before quietly leaving. Its clear Benjen knows all of mankind (which presently includes his living nephew Bran) will soon be in a war for their very survival against the the Night King, the White Walkers,  and their army of undead... Yet Benjen doesnt wish his own nephew Bran good fortune in the wars to come? To me, its clear Benjen knows what Bran will become and that Brans future incarnation is that of the Night King. 

I may be over analyzing this... but I feel this is the clearest hint from the showrunners that Bran will become the Night King. I linked video of the scene below. Feel free to give me your thoughts on the scene.

I even had my own theory before he was revealed to be a creation of the children that the NK was Rhaegar Targaryen.

What if a few events that were kind of confusing to the story happened only for the purpose for the Stark children to not be able to have kids. Heirs are such an important topic in this show and who will rule who will rule what when its all over.


- Ive heard of Paraplegic's having children but its not that common. Bran falling from the tower and everything that happened to him could have still happened (being the three eyed raven etc.) if he had the use of his legs. I think it was done just so he couldn't produce an Heir but we don't know that at this time. I read somewhere were Ned even said he couldn't have them in the book. 


- We wondered why didn't Arya didn't die from her stab wounds, and it seemed to be just a pointless plot line since she came away from those injuries completely fine in like one episode. If you really pay attention to it though, she is stabbed multiple times in the gut so it seems to me, there is no way she will ever be able to have kids after that. I think it was done by the directors only for that reason and we will find out later. 


- The rape of Sansa, and ""he hurts me every night"" was done to show she cant potentially have kids if she was injured bad enough for how ever long she endured all of that. After everything she may not even wants kids anyway. 


Point is, the only Stark left that can have kids is Jon but he is a Targaryan. Could it be revealed that he is the only one that can further the stark line so he chooses to remain a stark instead of a Targaryan. Potentially keeping his parentage a secret because of this. So any child by him and Danny would be a stark. the last of the Starks. If not the Stark name will just die out. Maybe that's just part of how the end game goes, no more starks and maybe that's what the Night King wants really. Or like another theory I have everyone will die and the baby of Danny and Jon will be turned into a white walker and be the Next Night king. I don't know it's all just theory like everything else, but it is plausible and something to think about. ",24,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

The common greeting-response couplet from the continent of Essos is exactly the kind of unimportant small detail that authors only include to give glaring hints at the deeper thematic meaning of their story. The phrases translate to All men must die, and All men must serve. I chose this detail, but I could have easily taken the motto of the Drowned God What is dead may never die! or the tenets of the Many Faced Gods religion which demands his followers become no one, to introduce the idea: Game of Thrones is thematically centered around Existentialist philosophical questions. 
 
Existentialism argues that whatever forces the external world uses to pressure a person, there is still always room for choice on that persons part. No matter a persons role as an employee, they can choose to defy the orders of superiors and possibly be fired for example. I was just following orders, is the worst excuse one could give to an Existentialist. These ideas are applicable to rejecting social expectations based on categories like race, gender, and social class in order to choose ones own path. Even ones own past and prior actions should not be viewed as a restraint on present action. An implication of this fundamental idea is that your choices are ultimately totally your own responsibility and therefore are revealing of the truth of your essence, what you really are, arguably something that can be labeled as a spirit or soul; and in this way living life can be viewed as a process of self-discovery. It doesnt take much to see how these ideas about personal essence connect to political ideas of freedom of choice for individuals and abhorrence of slavery and stereotyping.  
 
And these are all themes we see at the forefront of Game of Thrones. The drama of the female characters struggles with their gender roles is thoroughly explored in several characters and plotlines, but also Samwells struggles with his fathers expectations of him and the few thousand eunuchs running around in the story explore masculine gender roles. Class roles are explored in characters like Jon Snow and Ser Davos, Knight of Onions, both of whom are in the running for Most Noble Characters in their respective Main and Supporting character weight classes, and both of whom at least technically were commoners early in life. There is bigotry against Wildlings on the part of the people of the Seven Kingdoms, and the cultural expectations of the Free People for the behavior of Southerners is similarly constrained. Jorah and Theon address issues of histrionics and self-perception from prior actions. There are too many examples to enumerate them all. Even so, issues of socially constructed identity are only one facet to this problem, and arguably a minor one. 

Existentialism goes much farther than the impositions of people on oneself and argues that any imposition from the external universe should be held separate from our responsibility for our choices. With respect to our opening couplet, All men must die, All men must serve. George RR Martin is pointing to the many occurrences in his world where characters are faced with choices of the form: Do this action or greatly imperil your life, Frequently in his world if you are acting in accordance with self-preservation you are likely not serving your own internal will and desires, but are likely bowing to the will of forces outside of oneself. Similarly, if one is truly imposing ones will on the external universe it is almost necessarily an act of sacrifice, most potently of ones own life. The use of the word must in the couplet is ironic because normally it signifies lack of choice, but by using it twice there is a suggestion that both are possible and that perhaps choosing among the options of service and death is also possible. Of course this choice is exactly the kind of choice Existentialist philosophers view as importantly revealing of The Self, despite the potential threat of death on one side of the choice. It seems much of Game of Thrones is about how choosing to greatly imperil or even outright end ones life may in fact be the superior option. 
 
Qhorin Half-Hand asking Jon Snow to kill him in front of the Wildlings in order to help Jon Snow is a case where a character was choosing to die. Now granted, Qhorin was probably only giving up some views of the scenery and an opportunity to be tortured to death by sacrificing himself in a mock fight with Jon, but even this can be viewed as a microcosm of the choices for self-sacrifice. Yes Qhorin was going to die much sooner than others faced with a choice of dishonorable action or temporary life extension, but if say Robb Stark just sat and did nothing at the death of his father one could argue that the remainder of his life would likely be as empty and meaningless as Qhorins march to inevitable painful death through the bleak northern wilderness (even if he retained power personally and fathered children, eventually his dishonoring of his familial obligations may set a precedent that results in the crumbling of the house and eradication of the Stark name). Tyrions choice to lead the defense of Kings Landing at the Battle of the Blackwater may have been a similar choice of likely immediate death versus a slightly postponed death, but this didnt stop Joeffry from being tempted to cower in hiding. Or if Jon Snow didnt take his last best shot to retake Winterfell despite the risks, if Hodor didnt sacrifice himself to hold the door, if Sam had allowed Gilly to be raped by the other Nights Watchmen, if Ser Davos didnt stand up on several occasions to dutifully offer a contradicting opinion to his Lord, their lives may have been meaningless marches to a slightly postponed death.  
 
But even more than simply being an occasionally correct and valid option, the metaphysics of Game of Thrones makes sacrifice into an inverse of service whereby sacrificing allows one to impose more of their own will on the world. This is clearly illustrated by the necessity of blood sacrifice to the workings of most types of magic (with the possible exceptions of warghing and greensight, but weirwood trees are strongly hinted to be at least partially dependent on human remains for nutrients), most dramatically perhaps with the birth of the dragons. Less directly, the willingness of Jon Snow to sacrifice himself for the Freefolk at Hardhome created a strong bond of loyalty with them; by pursuing the alliance with the Freefolk to the exclusion of other possibilities, notably the possibility of internal cohesion of the Nights Watch and his own continued mortal existence he concentrated enough willful energy to bring the alliance into existence. Ultimately I would predict the story will play out to show that the noble self-sacrifice of Ned Stark was much more effective at achieving his goals than other characters, possibly most importantly Cersei. Particularly, he will be shown to be more successful at the goals of the endurance of his family, the perpetuation of his cultural values and traditions, and being remembered favorably. 
 
And in doing so Martin is definitively breaking with a Nihilistic world view. This may be a surprising assertion considering the copious levels of mayhem, gore, and general chaos in the story coupled with the apparent complete silence of the various deities. A writer friend of mine told me he received a note from an executive instructing him to make a script more like Game of Thrones. When I asked him what that meant he said It basically meant to make all the characters be dicks to each other for no reason. But Martin gives his world a Justice mechanism which gives us insight into the reasoning of the deities of Game of Thrones, Martin chief amongst them. 
 
Rhllor and the Drowned God have an opposite approach to the existential questions of the show but share a lack of moral direction on the choices faced by their adherents. The Lord of Light encourages his followers to burn brightly, signifying the Existentialist view that some possibilities must be sacrificed or burned in order to enhance the potential for other possibilities, specifically the possibilities that are expressing the inner desires of the follower. The Red God would probably encourage courageous acts of self-sacrifice made for great causes. The Drowned God exhorts followers to let go of ambition, and goes in a more Buddhist direction calling for an end of internal desire and realization of the power loss-of-ego gives. He probably would frown on self-sacrifice for a cause, but he also would frown on over-attachment to life, as both things imply caring about something. (I think the Iron Islands is what happens when as a society people try to respond to every societal problem or issue with I dont give a shit, it is a land where possession is ten tenths of the law after all.) I dont think either of these deities or religious belief systems have any particular issue with someone pursuing an evil life either because they want to or because they dont care to be good. Just be passionate about being evil to appease the Red God or be completely apathetic towards good to appease the Drowned God.  
 
The faith of the Seven and the religion of the Old Gods in the North give more moral guidance. The Old Gods dont seem to have a religious text, but their religion largely consists of prohibitions against various dishonorable acts (and rituals associated with trees). The faith of the Seven basically outlines six general categories of valid pursuits and a seventh None of the above, category which essentially represents making an invalid choice. I have heard it argued that The Seven all represent Death, and that is in some sense true, but there is a Yin kind of dying and a Yang kind of dying; with Yang you are projecting your will into the world with Existential authenticity, with Yin you are not. 
 
The faith of the Seven is the most heavily developed in the show and it serves as a sort of categorization of Martins views on the primary motives of characters. Each of the six good or ""Yang"" deities represents some role or motive that many of the characters in the show are fulfilling or trying to fulfill and which is worth sacrificing time and physical safety to achieve. The Father represents maintenance of values and the social order. Ned Stark and Tywin Lannister would represent attempts to fulfill this role through most of their in show plotlines (attempts: Ned seems to be more successful). The Warrior represents change of values and social order and could be represented possibly by a young rebel Ned Stark, Arya or Brienne of Tarth. The Smith represents work and sometimes applied wisdom more generally. Tyrion, Samwell, and possibly occasionally Daenerys represent this role in their plotlines. I've heard it argued that The Smith and Work represent servitude but this is incorrect. Who was Gendry serving while he forged his own armor? The labor of Tyrion and Varys to hold the world together similarly represents authentic choices on their parts; they aren't being forced to be advisors to rulers and likely have the means to live leisurely quiet lives if they chose to. The Mother represents nurturing the young and leaving literal genetic descendants, and obvious instantiations of the role include Cat Stark and Cersei, but arguably Ned Stark fulfills this role as well in his plotlines. His hiring Aryas fencing instructor leaps to mind in particular. The Maiden represents beauty, being well liked and being good company. Sansa is the most constant portrayal of this role, but Tyrion actually of all characters has a very interesting relation to this existential goal that reveals insight in Martins view on sexuality. Tyrion is a character who for a very long time is frustrated by his inability to be liked or romantically loved. The Crone represents transmission of wisdom and is most clearly represented in Olenna Tyrells character, although Maester Aemon and the Three Eyed Crow are other good examples. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive. Clearly characters can flow from one role to another, and give commentary on a role which is secondary to a more primary role for the character. 
 
And then there is the None of the above, choice. The Stranger represents doing things which will ultimately endanger yourself and your family, bring harm to your society, weaken its institutions, and reduce its ability to self-maintain, and bring infamy on you and your name. He represents Yin. While these could theoretically be life goals and represent an Existentially valid choice if the choice is made authentically, this is not often the case (one could say it would be strange to desire these things). You would have to hate the world very much in a basically completely suicidal and possibly spiteful way. That said, Tommen is a good example of someone who really does make an active choice to end his life for basically that reason, feeling as though all his other volitional power had been taken from him. Enslaved people also may want to exercise this option authentically. But most of the time characters fulfilling the role of the Stranger are not doing it on purpose. Stannis was trying to play the Father, but did so ineptly and wound up being the Stranger. From a pure Existentialist view point you could argue his decisions were valid: the Existentialist would say He pursued his ambition to the end. He died knowing he did everything he could. Rllor would be proud. Six of the Seven at least would not be. 
 
The Good Six of the Seven represent life goals echoed in the Stark family motto Family, Duty, Honor. These are the life choices and goals which Martin wants to assign a positive value. Goals of preserving DNA are associated with Family and the Mother; transmitting culture and values to the future is associated with Duty and the Father, Smith, and Warrior; being well-liked and remembered as good is what is meant by Honor and is clearly associated with the Maiden. The Crone floats over the whole thing and is responsible for resolving disputes when, for example, being liked conflicts with disciplining your children. 
 
While straight up ineptitude exists (perhaps best embodied by the character Edmure Tully) and can land you in the role of the Stranger, this doesnt tell us much about Martins Justice engine. A more interesting question is why Cersei has been such a failure in her role as Mother when others like Cat Stark have been successful (or will presumably be shown to have been successful by the conclusion of the series)? Isnt Mother one of the good goals? 
 
Cersei is brutal. Martin points to this many ways, but simply put: The Mountain is her physical reflection, physically ugly where she is physically beautiful, physically powerful where she is physically weak, but spiritually they are similarly brutal. Brutality in this Existentialist language of choice and desire means to pursue your own authentic desires, as Existentialists would always encourage, but to do so without due attention and consideration to the desires of others and their ability to make choices that further their goals, disempowering others more than necessary. This pursuit of ones own goals without care for others is perhaps most forcefully represented in the act of rape, a motif that occurs frequently in the show. Cerseis reflection The Mountain is one of the more notable perpetrators of this crime. 
 
(Im only doing this in an aside because I want to keep talking about the mechanics of Martins Justice engine, but 
 
One Existentialist view is that our existence is something that actually is forced upon us by the universe or G-d or nature or whatever. Now at [nearly] any moment one could reject this thing being forced on us, but just the fact youd have to go through the trouble of committing suicide, for some Existentialists, makes existence tantamount to rape. But, even though you werent previously consulted about the universe you were being created into, you still can take control and live authentically. This character arc is basically how rape is used for Daenerys in season 1.) 
 
So what is so bad about frustrating the pursuits of others? The metaphysics of Martins Existentialist universe point to the idea that by pruning away some possibilities, other possibilities necessarily gain strength. When you prune away the potential to fulfill goals from others, they gain increased ability to fulfill other goals, specifically revenge on you for harming them. Olenna Tyrell illustrated this nicely in the last episode of season six. After the death of her entire family she was free to pursue revenge with complete abandon, even at the cost of her life or her houses power. If you dishonor a persons culture and traditions, destroy his ability to learn, kill his family, make him despised, and prevent him from transmitting his wisdom in his old age, then there is nothing (literally nothing, you took Father, Smith, Mother, Maiden, and Crone roles from him in Martins language, the Stranger literally represents nothingness and non-existence and he is all that remains besides the Warrior) between him and assuming the role of the Warrior to change you and your position of power. This means all the volitional energy that would have gone into all the other five existence-oriented goals goes instead into a revenge-focused Warrior. 
 
We see this perhaps best illustrated in Aryas plot line. If she were fettered by the continued existence of her parents she would likely be groomed for a diplomatic wedding and a life away from Needle. Now shes a cruise missile of revenge. She has none of the attachments to others in the Six of Seven, like Jon did to the Father when he was obeying the tradition of adherence to his oath to the Nights Watch, or Robb did to the Maiden when he married his true love, or Sansa does to the Maiden and femininity, or Cat Stark had to the Mother with her freeing of Jaime (it is hard to think of good examples for Crone and Smith, but Aemon Targaryan may be a case where they were chosen over the Warrior). But more potently, the origins of the Faceless Men were in slavery, and this lack of choice is what gave them mystical power to overcome their masters.  
 
So this is how GRRM argues against Nihilism in his work. This means that there is no possible evil prefix for the Mother or any other role. If you try to be evil while being the Mother you only end up generating an overwhelming self-defeating counterforce from the revenge you empower. You end up self-defeating, just a very specific kind of inept that will likely lead to fulfilling the Strangers role. GRRM seems to use some Taoist symbolism with Dragons representing forces of Yang and Tigers/Manticores representing the force of Yin (I have to credit The Order of the Green Hand youtube channel for pointing this out). This justice mechanism seems to suggest that Yang can be ""overshot"", leading back into Yin and implying that there is morality in his universe.",3,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

Suddenly, the walker screams in pain and falls apart into broken pieces, to his surprise Jamies opens his eyes and arya is standing over his head with a little smirk. The Hound, is crushing  every wight he sees and next to him is Berik with his flaming sword, as the battle gets thicker they stand back to back fighting douzens of wights.
Berik laughts and says: Looks like your stuck with a fire worshipper for the time being.
Hound replies: shut your facking mouth and fight before I...
Before he can finish the sentence a white walker throws a spear at berik and killls him. The Hound looks behind him and berik is dying, the wights moved back as the white walker approaches the two.
Sander says to Berik: why is it that everytime I start making friend something bad has to happen to them.
Berik: We are friends now (smile)
berik is now dead and the white walker is only a few feets away. Sander looks very angry and upset, he charges at the white walker with all his might swinging from all direction. The white walker looses one hand is the exchange, but he looks unfazed, the fighting continues and walker lost both his arms and is on his knees. The hand is standing over him sword in the air and says: got anything to says before your die.
The white walker screems in that screeching noise. The Hound: Your shit at dying your know, now shut your damn hole, strikes the walker.
Brienne is with Podrik as they are fighting white a larger amount of walkers and Bronn joins in after making sure Jamie is in a safe place. 
Bronn Says to pod: your magic cock isn't going to seduce this lot here, have you shown it to her yet (Brienne).
He replies: I am a warrior now, if your not careful enough I might ened up saving you. Brienne smiles
Bronn: will you look at that, Podrick fucking pain is going to save me huh, hahahhahaha watch carefully you might learn a thing or two from me and they continue to fight. Out of nowhere, the last white walket charges in with his horse towards Brienne, Pod and Bronn and all of them jump out of it way, Brienne and Bronn look at each other and then look towards the walker and they see Pod's at the end of the walker spear dead. Tears come out of Bronn eyesand he mumbles: the squire... Pod 
Brienne screem at the time: Noooooo
they charge toward the walker and cut his horses front legs similtaniously. the walker falls Bronn says to Brienne: i'll keep those fuckers away and you that monster for Pod, she noded.
brienne run  towards the walker and he swiftly moves away dodging every attack Brienne throws at him. After a few exchanges Brienne is tiered she swings at the walker but looses her grip of sword, now she is unarmed and the walkeris moving towards. Suddenly, he hears a voice of a man saying: Hey that's my women your about to kill, the walker turn around as he turned around brienne picks up the sword and pierces through his back. Tormund looks at brienne and smiles at her with desire burning in his eyes, she just rolls her eyes. and walks towards Pods dead corps.

I know there are many theories about the Night King and stuff, but...

Well, I was re-watching GoT and it just hit me, when Bran took over the 3ER's role in the story. I kept on thinking about that and the connection to the NK.

Could that be possible that the Night King is actually not a single person but rather a 'title'? I mean something similar to Bran/3ER type of incarnation or so. Then, it seems pretty understandable the Night King would also need some 'succesor', who must probably have some strong talents/powers, similar to Bran, perhaps even king's blood (which Starks have, as they were first Kings in the North) What if all the boy 'sacrifices' actually were meant to find 'the true succesor'? I doubt all the boys survived to become the WW's (perhaps?) and the Night King might still be 'searching'.

And one more thing. Could that be possible 3ER is also some kind of a 'weapon', created by the CotF?

What do you think? Is that even possible?",3,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

For example, Arya's is literally introduced as a warrior already, outshooting Bran with a bow, even as he is guided by his two older brothers. For me, this scene really took away a sense of transformation in the character of Arya. 

After all, if Arya was allowed to practice shooting a bow to the point of outshooting her brother, hasn't the identity of Arya already been established? Why would her Lord father/ the rest of society look so negatively on her attempts to break gender norms, when these norms have clearly already been broken? How can Lord Eddard rationalize prohibiting her from yielding a sword when surely he was already aware of her ability with a bow?

Has this scene struck anyone else as slightly odd? In addition, can anyone else think of other examples in which Arya's journey has been weirdly contradicted like this?",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is a lie. Jon knows it. Jorah knows it.

But in S07 again when he could lie ""just a bit"" to Cersei for much more important matter of dealing with NK and his army, he refuses to lie.

The difference is: the first time he lied because he thought (maybe) Jorah want to have his honor back (kind of) and the second time he didn't lie because of his own honor.

So: in GoT a character can lie if honor demands. The true meaning of ""honor"" seems complex in GoT. It is certainly a mix of selfishness, judgement of people (after you), involving promises or not, ...

Still: a lie is a lie.

What do you think about the meaning of ""honor"" in GoT?",20,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

While the books and the show is now on different paths I fully believe that the show will follow GRRM's ending, at least mostly.  With that in mind I think that the show will end with a few, perhaps 7, main characters leaving Westeros and finding new lands to try and settle.  Before you down-vote, hear me out.  

GRRM has repeatedly said that it will be a bittersweet ending, so we know it won't be fully ""the good guys win"" or ""the good guys lose"" it will subvert our expectations.  I also subscribe to the belief that the Night King and his army of wights is an allegory for global warming.  I don't think it would be nearly as powerful if they are simply defeated, no matter how heroic or how heavy the sacrifices are, as they haven't paid enough attention to them and that in my opinion would ruin the allegory and be too predictable.  I believe that instead of killing the Night King, Jon will broker a peace deal as he has already done with tremendous success with the wildlings.  While i'm not sure how this will happen specifically I believe the agreement will be that the survivors will leave Westeros, giving it to the Night King so they can fulfill what they were created for (protecting Westeros from the Andals).  If I had to guess perhaps he learns how to communicate via Sam + Brann.

I also believe that the group of people leading will be an oligarchy of seven.  Seven specifically to tie in with the religion, each of them fulfilling the roles of the seven.  If I had to guess I would say father (Jon), mother (Dany), maiden (Sansa), stranger (Arya), smith (Gendry), crone (Cersei, who will come around to protect her child), and warrior (Jaime).

While i'm positive many people will disagree with me I think this would be a really interesting and unexpected ending for the show, having 7 main characters live where you expect them all to die but they all lose their home and everything they've fought for would be very bittersweet.",11,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

She was in Belfast and apparently she is playing a character named Willa.  Who does everyone think this character will be?  Alice Nokes is between 19-20 years old so my thinking is that possibly she will be either the daughter or granddaughter of a northern lord.  Perhaps her father or grandfather will try and arrange her to be married to Jon since he is not married (yes he is with Danny now but the northern lords don't know that yet).  Maybe she will be a Manderly since Jon will be landing in White Harbor upon his return to the north.  What does everyone think though?

Before the army of the dead arrives at Winterfell, The Hound and Arya meet up again and head to King's Landing so Arya can cross the rest of the names off of her list. They eventually get there and The Hound and Arya confront Cersei and the Mountain, but right as they're about to fight the Night King swoops in on Viserion and starts destroying Kings Landing and killing thousands. He let his current army fight the people at Winterfell while he went for the 1 million or so people in Kings Landing to strengthen his army. It's possible Cersei dies here or isn't present and ends up escaping. Either way, she isn't really important in this part of the theory. 

So Viserion is breathing blue flames all around Kings Landing and the Mountain and Hound end up fighting anyway. The Hound tells Arya to leave and save herself so she can help the others. In the end, the Hound saves Arya and fights the Mountain while surrounded by the undead and blue flames. The Hound kills the Mountain but eventually dies from dragon fire. 

Let me know what you think of this theory. It fits in with how I see the rest of the show going. I really think that Kings Landing is going to get fucked by Viserion so the Night King can grow his army 10 times over.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was an inevitability - GRRM was the great storyteller, the showrunners were only ever tasked with adapting the story for the screen and writing around the most crucial parts. They don't have GRRM's creativity or ability, but I don't think anyone expected that they would end up having to continue the damn thing on their own. When a goldmine has run dry but the project isn't completed, you have to use the whatever nuggets of gold you have left wisely and make do with bog standard bronze for the rest of the task. So fair enough, the show is what it is, and had no choice but to become a creature of its own.


But *what the fuck* is season 7? I thought I'd check it out for a bit of light entertainment, but I haven't been able to suspend my disbelief once. So many, many things are so illogical and unbelievable. 


Why did Jamie run at the dragon? How did he survive a plunge into water with full armour - why was the battlefield completely clear by the time he came up for breath? What was the point in the Dornish lady takeover if they all just get killed before accomplishing anything? Whats the point in Gendry returning? Whats the point in Benjen returning? Why does Jon Snow, such a crucial political figure, make himself part of the expedition to the wilderness to capture a wight? Why did *he* have to be there and put himself in such suicidal danger when he had a perfectly capable team of expendable men to do the job for him? What kind of plan was 'capture a zombie and show it to Cersei' anyway? How did they not get overrun **in seconds** when they were surrounded at all sides - why did they use a bunch of camera shots for minutes upon minutes making it out like the horde was running at them one by one? Why did Jon not get on the dragon straight away instead of running out and fighting stragglers before falling into a hole?

The relationship between Jon Snow and Daenerys came out of absolutely nowhere. A couple of conversations about their duties and pasts, Tyrion saying ""he's in love with you"", Daenerys saying ""no he's not"" and while thinking ""ooh might he be?"" and then she saves his life and then they're together. It was sudden and forced and while it might make sense thematically (fire queen and ice king get together, song of ice and fire, yada yada) there was no convincing relationship development. Grey Worm and Missandei had more build up, screen time, chemistry and reason to be together - and that's saying something! It must have been done for fan-service, because people wanted Jon and Khaleesi to be together, or because the actors dated in real life, or just because some writer or show-runners thought it would be cool. Perhaps it happens in the books - but it would take a hell of a lot more than a few dry conversations, an explanation from Tyrion and then a deus-ex-machina wow-just-in-time! rescue scene to develop that relationship to a believable standard.

Emilia Clarke shows the same level of emotion when she arrives in Westeros, as when she rides her dragon, as when her dragon dies, as when she's burning someone alive, as when she meets Jorah, as when she says goodbye to Jorah, as when she does anything else. There is nothing in her delivery. It's constant stern-face stern-voice for everything, except for those times when she's calm and smiles a little. She over-pronounces every word and puts on a 'queenly' voice and that's the entirety of her line-delivery. She's a terrible actress. Scenes with her are unbearable. It's even more obvious when she's in a room with decent actors how incapable she is of giving a decent performance. Maybe it's the writing, or the scene direction - maybe the writing and scene direction is like it is to accommodate Clarke's lack of skill. Whatever's happening, it's awful. What should have been a momentous scene, her first arrival to Westeros, turned out to just be Clarke picking up some sand and looking a bit happy, walking a long distance to some epix music and then saying a cringe line. 

Who is this show's audience? It can't be the people who like the intricate story, because the story is no longer intricate - it's just a mishmash of average plot points, stupid plans, characters reuniting with underwhelming meetings, and fight scenes - bumbling on from one thing to the next. It can't be the people in it for the politics and intrigue - the conversations don't have good writing, there's no choice lines, the politics don't make sense, the narrative lacks complexity. It can't be the people who watch it for shock value - because nothing is particularly shocking. Oh, Jamie fell in a pond! Arya and Sansa fall out over a letter! Olenna finally confesses to poisoning Joffrey! (for the 5 or 6 people who still haven't realized that). Is it people who watch it for sex? No, there's no sex. So who is it? People who just want to see dragon CGI, zombies and Jon and Daenerys getting together?

The majority of the seasons, for all their flaws, remained entertaining. The book material was adapted well most of the time, and there were some really excellent newly created material. They handled some plots as well as they could, and did real justice to some scenes. They cut out some unnecessary fat that they couldn't really do much with (eg. Lady Stoneheart) and added in some material that was well written and fit the narrative. Many questionable scenes still managed to be exciting and interesting in their own way, while the really trash scenes were sporadic and glaringly obvious. There was a lot of guff and filler, but there was still a good amount of gold. In season 7, it's all shite.

I just had to get this off my chest, but please, if you're someone who still enjoys Game of Thrones, please explain why. Sell me on it. Does it have some merit that I've missed? Whats the deal?

Because the only reasons I can think of for someone still liking Game of Thrones are that they like it because they like dragons and zombie fights and they don't think about things making sense as long as Dany and Jon get together, and maybe they remember how good the show used to be but can't quite remember why so they just expect it's probably still good - because it's GAME OF THRONES, right!?! Winter is coming! Dracarys! Cunts!

I want to focus more on what everyone predicts will happen to the characters as to who lives and dies and how that occurs. I believe all the talk about the ""bittersweet"" ending is a clear warning we are gonna be pissed about at LEAST one main character's death so I wanted to get some opinions and share mine.

*Jon/Dany- I think one of these two is for sure gonna die. My money is on Jon because I feel like Dany has been established as the main ""leader"" and Jon has been brought back from the dead for what I believe to be a very important purpose. I see this as some sort of sacrifice where Jon is killed by the NK but in doing so saves Dany from imminent death and allows another character to kill NK and wrap up the war.

*Cersei- I know many people believe Jamie will kill Cersei (I too believed this for a while and kinda still hope it happens) but I'm putting my money on a tag team of sorts where Jamie distracts Cersei in some manner (Maybe she kills him) and while she is caught up with him Tyrion kills her. I like the idea of the Lannister boys being ""Kingslayer"" and the ""Queenslayer"". 

*Hound/Brienne- One of these two, if not both, are for sure dying in my mind and I hope for redemption's sake it's the Hound trying to protect Arya/Sansa. It would be bittersweet but gratifying to see this lovable asshole lay it all on the line in the end for his one true friend and companion(I realize he kinda already did when these two fought earlier but he didn't actually die).

These are the ones I feel most confident about but I would like to hear what others have to say on these takes as well as additional demises and causes you see coming in the final season!

So yeah last season he was pretty much wasted, After having such an awesome return in Ep 5 of last season only for one Ep later he just talks with some of the characters and then runs off to the wall to send a message....Oh yeah and loses his Hammer, Like seriously what the hell that's literally how you treat a character that has been gone for god knows how long.....Okay I shouldn't say that as Benjen was gone longer then Gendry but you get the point he was completed Wasted last season.

To the point where some people think he will just get killed off as he was just Pointless Fan Service, Well I don't think so they would not bring back a character as important as Gendry only to kill him off (Benjen was never really that important and Osha and Rickon I think were meant to be a Shaggydog story anyways) so I don't think he was just pointless Fan Service I think he was brought back for a reason. Now what is that reason well I think that reason is that he will Forge Dragonglass and possibly Valyrian steel to help in the battle against the WW's but also I believe he will reforge his Hammer. Some people also think he will have a Bromance with Jon and while I think we will get atleast one or two more scenes between Jon and Gendry I don't think that will be Gendry's main relationship for the entirety of the season, Besides leave the Bromance stuff for Jon and Sam.

If you really think about it the more likely Main relationship he is going to have for the season is with Arya Stark. I do think we will get a reunion between the two and we could see a continuation of there friendship and we could possibly see it go further into a Romance. Now yes Arya is now the romantic type but Arya may have changed since then as she said that as a child, and if not well it is possible something could happen this season that makes her move to this mind set, Also I think it makes sense as it has been forshadowed several times, They seem like a good match, and like Jon and Dany they are somewhat similar. Some say he should be with Sansa I don't think so to be honest though I wouldn't mind the idea of Gendry having Sansa AND Arya as his wives.

I also believe once this is he will be Legitimized and made Lord of Storm's end, Or maybe he will be revealed to be the true son of Robert and Cersei.",21,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Another was armored like the sun, Golden and beautiful.

1768,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-2-25,2018,2,25,7,80025z,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] Catspaw and the Dagger,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/80025z/everything_catspaw_and_the_dagger/,genkaus,1519511069,"During Baelish's trial, Arya says (paraphrasing) : ""You told our mother that this dagger belonged to Tyrion Lannister. That was another one of your lies. It was yours.""


Now, it seems that a lot of people take this statement to mean that Baelish never lost possession of that dagger (to Tyrion or Robert). And from that, they seem to conclude that he must have given that dagger to the catspaw, which would mean that he sent the assassin after Bran. To those who believe this, I'd like to ask how they address the following issues:


1. Why would Baelish arm the assassin with a unique dagger that belonged to him? Like Tyrion said - ""What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?"" - and he was right. This action would be too stupid for Cersei, let alone someone like Baelish. If the point was to frame the Lannisters, why not have a fancy dagger designed with a golden lion hilt? Or better yet, steal one of the Lannister daggers from the armory and give that to the catspaw. Or if owning a Lannister dagger maybe too obvious, how about one of Cersei's trinkets being found on the assassin as ""proof"" of the person who paid him? Or maybe, the bag of gold with the assassin happens to have a lion embossed on it? There are a thousand simpler ways to get the same result without Petyr ever having to lie to Catelyn - so why would he choose this risky and convoluted plan instead?


2. What was Petyr's plan for the catspaw? It was just sheer luck that summer happened to maul him to death during the assassination attempt. And that's not something Petyr could've expected to happen. A very real scenario would be that the assassin is caught before, during or after the attack and if he's caught, he'd be questioned. And he didn't seem like the type to hold out under torture. Even if he was told to blame the Lannisters, its not like he'd be killed as soon as he gives up a name. He'd be an important witness and they'd keep him alive and check and double-check every aspect of his story for inconsistencies - because blaming the Lannisters is going to be a big deal and you can be damn sure that the Starks would do their due diligence. So its really hard to see how that could've ended well for Petyr. 


3. If his plan was for the assassin to actually succeed and get away, what would the point of the dagger be then? If the assassin had killed Bran and gotten away, Cat would've never come to KL looking with the evidence and Petyr would've just given away his unique dagger to a random guy he'd never see again. 

4. The explanation of Petyr's plan is pretty convoluted. You expect us to believe that Petyr foresaw Catelyn finding the dagger, suspecting the Lannisters, traveling to KL in secret, meeting him in secret,  giving him the chance to lie about the dagger and then believing him. But there are a thousand different ways this could've gone in a different direction. Let's say Cat never gets out of her depression and stays by Bran's side. Let's say she sends Robb instead, who has no reason to trust Baelish. Let's say she makes it to the city but Varys doesn't find out about her and she ends up going to Ned first as planned. Let's say Varys does find out she is there, but informs Ned instead of Petyr. Let's say she refuses to go with Petyr's guards and insists on meeting her husband first. Let's say she does go to Petyr but keeps tight-lipped about the dagger despite Varys' prompting. Or let's say Varys happens to know who the dagger belongs to and tells Cat that he saw it in Baelish's possession a few days before the King left for Winterfell (after all, Baelish doesn't know what Varys does or doesn't know). If any of these things happen, Baelish has lost his chance to lie to Cat about the dagger and there is a huge risk that he'd be discovered as its real owner. So why do you expect Baelish never considered these possibilities? Or if he did, why did he dismiss them and take the risk anyway?


If Baelish had actually arranged for Bran's assassination attempt and planed on framing the Lannisters, this is how I'd expect him to do it - have one of his men dress up as a Lannister guard to hire the assassin. Make sure that the assassin sees the Lannister red and gold, is paid with a bag of gold with a lion embossed on it and is probably given a Lannister blade . This way, the assassin himself would believe that he was hired by the Lannisters and everything in his possession would confirm it. Then make sure to have another man in Winterfell who'd make sure that the first guy is caught before, after or during the attempt. And if necessary, make sure he dies soon after naming names. This way Baelish would've created the necessary rift between the Starks and Lannisters with minimal risk to himself and without ever having the need to lie to Catelyn. That is probably how Baelish would do it - but the way it was done seems a little too stupid to be him.

So misery and drama all around.

I was wondering whether this may hint at Dany's dragons causing major destruction and misery without Dany really intending to do so, but simply because it's in the nature of the dragons (and because Dany changed since she has three dangerous grown-up dragons).

The Nightking is a man who was turned into this cold and monstrous creature **against his will**, and he can create the White Walkers and the army of the dead to fight for him. But fight for what goal? What's the point of turning everyone into an undead? Does the Nightking have a choice?...

And Dany (consciously or not?) transforms into the ""mother of dragons"" when her dragons are born, and, as she says **""if they are monsters, so am I""**. But Dany never **meant** to become a monster. Yet she definitely changed since the dragons were able to be used as weapons. Dany's dragons help her win her fights, but when she comes to Westeros, what is she actually fighting for? She doesn't seem to think further than winning the throne. So what's the point of winning the throne, if she doesn't like ruling? Does Dany (characterwise) have a different choice than fighting for the throne?

So basically if this theory is right Theon saves Yara only for her to die then Theon kills Euron. Which after all is done he goes to help Jon and Dany and afterwards becomes king of the Iron Islands and maybe marries Sansa.

Now while I would personally not mind this but three problems keep me from seeing it as a legitimate prediction. 1. I don't think Theon and Sansa see each other that way 2. What would really be the point? Yeah Theon would have the North support but he does not need it if he goes to help Jon anyways nor can he even Produce children (though yes I know they can just adopted or maybe if Jon and Dany die he and Sansa raise there child or maybe Sansa promises Brienne she and Theon will raise her and Jaime's child or something like that) 3. Would it really make sense since there has bene now forshadowing for it (and if it does happen they will have to put more symbolism on it early on in S8, and also have Sansa mention Theon again).

So yeah it is a interesting idea and I am surprised a lot of people aren't mentioning it but, It just seems alittle unlikely. Not to mention I think Sansa will die next season so...Yeah.

Why doesn't it cross anyone's mind that Lyanna might have been pregnant? They all assumed she was raped but when Ned brings back Jon, not one person doubts his story? Lyanna is ""taken and raped"" and Ned comes back with a baby.

Cat was too emotional and not logical so she would never think that much to question Ned. But seriously this guy went to war, slept with another woman and obviously kept her around long enough to know she was pregnant and bring the baby back. How did no one notice this? He was at war so I am sure he did not just travel alone.

How did Ned bring Jon back without raising questions? Howland Reed is injured so we know he has to take him to get help. Did he leave Jon with the maiden in the tower until he returned alone? 

Did Ned ever mention how Lyanna died?

So, my question, is why didn't Stannis (who apparently had cliffs, boulders, and ledges of the stuff) not hire artisans, jewelers, and skilled craftsmen to work the obsidian into valued pieces of ceremonial or practical use (it IS stated to be sharper than steel) and sell them for a profit in Westeros, or even Essos.

why Im thinking about the afterlife, I think the old religion of faceless gods did believe there is one, because there were references about the afterlife and they were all around the Starks. 
in the book the Winterfell lords had their swords cross their lap to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts, so Ned was wondering if the other northern kings are ghosts roaming the castle, because their swords have vanished with time. 
And when King Robert was on his deathbed, Robert told Ned I will give Lyanna your love, Ned. 
Plus Ned wished the Gods would tell Robert the truth about Joffrey, so he wont think Ned betrayed him by disinheriting his sons.

I've been playing around with the idea that it's Stannis, because I thought of him when I heard this quote by Ned in the Season 6 Histories &amp; Lore voiceover:

&gt; One of their leaders, the Smiling Knight, was a madman. Cruelty and honor jumbled together. But he didn't know fear. 

I thought of Stannis for a few reasons. First, ""cruelty and honor jumbled together"" sounds like him, the guy who both knighted and chopped off the fingers of Davos for being both a hero and a smuggler during the rebellion. 

Second, Stannis either had no fear or persevered through it when shit got real. Starting as far back as the siege and continuing all the way to the battle for Winterfell when all the odds were against him, even accepting his execution with a brave face. 

Third, the running joke throughout the series is that Stannis never smiles; maybe the nickname is meant to be sarcastic, similar to ""Brienne the Beauty""? 

Last but not least, the Kingswood Brotherhood was considered by the smallfolk to be the only ones protecting their rights. Stannis isn't exactly an angel, but this quote from the books came to mind:

&gt; Few of the birds Maester Aemon had returned as of yet. One found Stannis, though. One found Dragonstone, and a king who still cared.

It's said that the Smiling Knight was killed by Arthur Dayne, but this whole part of the backstory is so vague (to me, at least) that I haven't completely discounted this possibility. I also very strongly believe that we don't yet know everything there is to know about the Mannis.

&gt; I'm not so easily killed, men have been trying for years.

What do you think? Did I miss something in the series (show or books) that makes this impossible?

The first three are so tightly written and focused, and Martin really started meandering in books 4 and 5, and due to that they feel very bloated. I feel that 5 is an improvement, but that's really not saying too much.

But I have been torn apart more than once for saying _anything_ negative about this universe, and ""how dare I insult the brilliance of GRRM"", etc etc. I'm not pretending that I could ever so what he's done, because I can't. But I don't think that anyone can honestly say that book 4 is an improvement on what's come before it. I still love this world, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have room to improve.

What are some criticisms that you've had of the show or books that people have blindly defended, simply because it's part of ASOIAF? And I'm not talking about opinions based things, but things that you feel are valid flaws with the franchise. ",60,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally, I always felt extremely bad for her. She seemed like a kind and genuine person to me, and she had such a horrible fate. Not to mention her husband openly humiliating her in favour of Lyanna Stark. (That being said, I know what happened to Lyanna was horrible as well.) I could relate to Oberyn wanting to get revenge for his sister. 

It feels like most people outside of Dorne have forgotten about Elia, or choose to ignore her. To some extent, I guess this extends to the fandom as well, but I'm not picky with that since each person is different.

I hope you like them enjoy:

- Jon and Dany arrive at WF and while Jon gets a warm welcome from the stark children the Northern lords are not please to meet him upon the news of him bending the knee, Sansa and Arya surprisingly are not too happy with him bending the knee and Arya even poisons Varys remembering him back in KL and suspecting he would betray J&amp;D.

- Jaime convinces atleast half of the Lannister army and Edmure and the Riverlands forces to join him and Bronn in the fight against the dead. They arrive and help Jon and Dany in the battle, But there combined forces are still no match and they fallback, The battle results in the deaths of Grey Worm, Jorah, Tormund, Ghost, Edmure, and most of the Northern Lords but Bran trapped at the Weirwood in WF has Dragonglass put into his chest being turned into a WW.

- Cersei has her miscarriage, Euron arrives with the GC but Euron attacks the city as Cersei, Qyburn, and the Mountain with some Lannister forces escape through the secret entrance and head to take Storm's end. Euron then takes the Iron throne and declares himself king of the Seven Kingdoms and sends Harry with the GC to deal with Jon's forces and bring Dany to him.

- Dany is revealed to be Pregnant, Bran and Sam prior to the first battle in WF decide to wait and tell him about his parentage later as he needs to focus on the battle, Afterwards Sam does tell Jon about his true Parentage.

- Sansa is killed sacrificing herself to allowing Arya escape from certain danger (this danger is either WW related or GC related) Making Arya the last Stark until Beric brings Sansa back with the last kiss, Mel arrives in old lady form suggesting they kill Dany to make the weapon Jon is disgusted by this and has Mel executed.

- Arya puts an end to Cersei only for her to be Resurrected by the NK, Jaime then kills the Undead Cersei and forges Lightbringer, It is revealed the NK is a Proto-Stark as Euron and Theon fight in KL, Theon kills Euron with help from Jaime but Theon dies in the process saving Yara. 

- the final battle takes place in the Trident paralleling Robert's Rebellion with Jon on Rhaegal and NK on Viserion. Dany was sent to Dragonstone where it would be safer but Dany survives childbirth and as Rhaegal dies and Jon falls with him (surviving the fall though), Dany on Drogon comes in on the last minute and kills the undead Viserion but Drogon is wounded in the process, NK survives and Jon sadly knows what he has to do he plunges Longclaw into her heart and forges Lightbringer as he fights the NK one on one he over powers him but Arya comes from behind and stabs the NK in the back allowing Jon to get the finishing blow.

- Jaime with Sam rides to the God's eye to find Bran as a WW, Meanwhile none of the Wights collapse and as Rhaegal raises from the dead and is about to burn Arya, Jon, and Drogon Jaime plunges Lightbringer into Bran's heart and undead Rhaegal and all the Wights collapse and the WW's break apart and Jaime sercomes to his wounds from Euron and Drogon also sercomes to his wounds and dies as well.

- Brienne dies during childbirth to Jaime's child, Kingdom wide rebuilding is held as the Kingdom is turned into a Proto-Democratic one with Bronn getting his castle in Highgarden and becoming Lord of the Reach, Yara getting the Iron Islands, New houses getting Stormlands, Riverlands, and the Vale (Robin died in a ""Accident"" Involving the moondoor), Tyrion gets Casterly Rock, and Jon becomes King of the Seven Kingdoms NOT because he wants to but because it is his duty.

- He also Marries Sansa NOT because he wants to or because he loves Sansa that way but so that he can have the North truly in his support and also his child with Dany can have somewhat of a Mother with Sansa willingly agreeing to marry him so his child with Dany can have a Mother, Arya becomes Queen in the North/Lady of Winterfell NOT because she wants it but because there must always be a Stark in WF. Gendry also chooses to be with Arya and marries her taking the Stark name with the two raising Jaime and Brienne's child.

- Sandor survives Cleganebowl and decides to become Sansa Royal protector, Davos is made hand, Sam is made Jon's Maester, and the Bittersweet ending is that Jon defeated the WW's but lost another love, Married a woman he doesn't even love in that way, and raises his child without the true born Mother. Also Magic Disappears and yes after Euron is defeated Harry changes sides.

- Qyburn is never heard from again, He is Presumed dead.",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

1911,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-2-27,2018,2,27,13,80jp8e,self.gameofthrones,"[EVERYTHING] Extreme weather, CotF, White-walkers and nature magic theory (mix of books and show info)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/80jp8e/everything_extreme_weather_cotf_whitewalkers_and/,thegingerperil,1519706655,"S6E05 via Bran/3ER weirwood vision, we see the CotF appear to create an Other/WW, by thrusting dragonglass into the heart of a First Man tied to a Weirwood Tree, surrounded by megaliths in some freaky ritual. 

In the vision, the area is NOT in winter. It's green and lush. We also see the same Weirwood tree in the present day but this time, in winter. And know that the location of this tree is beyond the wall, in the Land of Always Winter. 

So this scene tells us that the Land of Always Winter was not always winter (contrary to its name).

I would guess that the ritual we witness via Bran is occurring over 10,000 years ago, during the time that the CotF and First Men were still at a war. Leaf says that they created the Others/WW to defend the CotF against men. However, the very name ""Land of Always Winter"" suggests that the First Men have no memory of the area (now beyond The Wall), ever being in anything but deep winter. 

So I postulate that; 

*During the war between CotF and the First Men far North Westeros was NOT cold or in winter, possibly there was not even such a thing as winter at all

*Sometime shortly after the CotF created the 1st Other... that area descended into winter and remained in winter from then on (or at least throughout the word of mouth history of Westeros and as recorded in place name). This could have happened fairly quickly, or taken 100's of years. Timescales are unreliable in GRRM world so I wouldn't want to state anything definitive. It's entirely possible that the First Men didn't reach the far north of Westeros for a long time after their migrations began.

So the theory i'd like to explore is; 

Was the ritual that created the white walkers some kind of nature_magic_abomination that caused some seriously f*cked up issues with nature and weather? Did the creation of the Whitewalkers ultimately create the messed up climate change issues and occasional extreme winters like the Long Night? 

Maybe the CotF broke some pact with the Old Gods? Or maybe there are inherent laws within the balance of the world that were violated by the CotF? 

I'm a book fan, but watch the show even more avidly now that is has surpassed the book timeline. Obviously there are aspects of the show that have been changed and don't represent GRRM's story, however, I doubt the show would change such a major plot point as the creation of the WW/Others, and go to the trouble of showing the scene in summer and winter very explicitly unless it was relevant overall. 

For book fans; 

In terms of book cannon, the only mention of the cause for the Long Night mentioned is kinslaying....the Bloodstone Emperor murders his sister to steel the throne of the Empire of the Dawn in the far east of Essos, this affronts two Gods who unleash their wrath in the form of the Long Night. 

As far as we know, the Long Night is experienced across Westeros and Essos at the same time and it's a global phenomenon. However, the winter stuff seems to be more specific to Westeros. 

In the books Melisandre describes The Wall as one of the ""hinges of the world"" referring to places of significance magically. She also thinks about how her magic is stronger at the Wall than even at Asshai. A lot of other people believe that The Shadow and Asshai are important magical geographic location and likely date to the Empire of the Dawn.

Was it two nature_magic_abomination acts near two opposite ""hinges of the world"", power spots that triggered the Long Night and subsequent equal/opposite reaction of messed up weather patterns across the globe? Was the Bloodstone Emporer act a fire abomination and the CotF/Other act an Ice abomination? Certainly we are told that rivers have dried up across Essos and the climate issues there seem to be fire/heat related (volcanoes, droughts etc). ",7,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

Stark - The brave arrogant jocks who care about doing the right thing and fighting evil.

Bolton - The house that everyone despises and thinks are evil. Bolton students are generally nasty and sadistic and are arch rivals to the Starks.

Targaryen - The laid back and exotic kids who don't care about issues and just want to be left alone in peace, they are generally amazing at Quidditch. Most of them are kind and passionate and dislike being controlled.

Tyrell - The kids who are quiet and intelligent, they enjoy reading or playing music. Tyrell students love learning and are serious when it comes to academics.",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

And one for Sansa https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7r3o4p/everything_theoriespredictions_on_sansa_stark/

It only makes sense I do one for the third surviving Stark child Bran Stark. Now a lot of people don't like Bran or his story, But (and this will be a shock) I actually like Bran as a character and I like his story, I thought I was interesting seeing him grow and seeing him go on this Journey to find this Three Eyed Raven (Or Three Eyed Crow or BloodRaven or whatever he calls himself) to walk again only to find out he will never walk again he will fly. But there is more to that as Bran's Journey is actually very important, Because if he is important as Jojen and 3ER say he is then that means his endgame and fate are very important.

Like Sansa and Unlike Arya, Bran's arc is really easier to pinpoint as well but let's look at the options:

1. He dies- Okay so a lot of people think he will be the Stark that dies, But to be honest I don't think he will because for one what would be the point of having him go on his Journey and secondly it would not fit with my theory of Bastards, Cripples, and Broken Things ruling the Seven Kingdoms. So I think Bran will live but if he does die it will be at the hands of NK most likely at WF.

2. He connects himself to a Weirwood tree just as the 3ER did- Okay so another way his endgame could take him is history repeating itself, and Bran hooks himself up to a Weirwood growing old just as the Three Eyed Raven did long ago, Now idk if this will happen exactly like this but it would be really cool if history repeated itself.

3. He becomes a Villain- Now one theory I heard is that 3ER is actually evil, and that he is using Bran and turning Bran into a dark person. The theory also goes further to say he is helping the WW's but for the show atleast that is not true but this could have some weight to it and it relates to the theory that GOT takes some inspiration from Ragnarok and maybe the Bittersweet ending, Though I don't think it'll happen atleast for the show this may be a book only thing (though I heard somewhere for the show he could be simply turned into a WW).

4. He Wargs into a Raven- Now one thing that could happen is Bran dies but Wargs into a Crow or Raven and lives the rest of the days in the birds body. Now if this happens it would be fantastic for one it fits with what he has become, It fits with the words of 3ER ""You will never walk again. You will fly"" and also imagine Bran living the rest of his days as a Crow seeing the world's beauty from a Birds eye view, That would be beautiful. Only problem is that it means he has to die

5. King in the North- Bran becomes King in the North, Need I say more.

6. Sigh.....He becomes the Night King- Now this is my least Favorite outcome and that is Bran becomes the NK, The theory goes is that at some point Bran is going to decide he needs to go back in time and try to stop the WW's and change the Present for the Better. He first starts by going back to the times of the Mad King and whispers into his heart Build the Wall or something only for it not to translate and the Mad King starts screaming ""Burn them All"", Then goes back and tries to Warg Bran the Builder only to build the wall (which apparently is considered a failure), then finally he goes further back and Wargs into one of the First men and tries to tell the Children of the Forest about the future, They don't believe him of course and they gag him and strapped him to a tree putting a Dragonglass Dagger into his chest, Bran tries to get out but he was in there for too long and he gets stuck in the man's body as he is turned into the first WW aka the NK. Okay so this theory is really just stupid and I hope it does not come true, I don't even think I have to say why it's dumb.

EDIT: oh gosh I forgot to add a other idea.

7. Bran is the one who saves everyone- now bran has been told allot that he is important or he will save everyone. What if he is the true hero and what if he is even possibly Azor Ahai. I think this is very possible and I would absolutely love it if this was the case.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
