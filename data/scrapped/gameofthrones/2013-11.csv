7,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2013-11-1,2013,11,1,10,1pnro3,self.gameofthrones,[ASoS/Season 3 Spoilers] So I'm yet another person who's just finished reading ASoS... thoughts...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1pnro3/asosseason_3_spoilers_so_im_yet_another_person/,clearlygonemad,1383269600,"So there are so many posts like this, which almost made me not want to write something. But I was so emotionally impacted by this book... I just need to put something down, and share with fellow fans, as well as discuss different elements of the book and people's thoughts. I haven't started AFfC yet, so please no spoilers beyond ASoS!

Wow. I really think this might be my favorite book of all time. But I haven't finished the series yet ;). So much happened! And I've watched all 3 seasons of the show, so I was ready for The Red Wedding. But I had no idea just how much I had in store.
I don't have any structure to my thoughts, so I'll just write them as I go.

I am extremely biased from having watched the show, but it felt like The Red Wedding was foreshadowed so much in the book. It sucked that I knew it was coming, but it was pretty clear that there was going to be no forgiveness from Walder Frey. I dreaded reading leading up to the wedding. The inter-weaving of the lyrics from ""The Rains of Castamere"" was excellent. It made me even more miserable, and implanted a very uncomfortable association with the song.

Tyrion! Oh man... I knew I liked him. But when Shae testified at the trial, I was so heartbroken. I loved Shae (at least in the show). I wanted to believe her when she said that they forced her to say those things. But Tyrion was right: calling him the ""giant of Lannister"" after mocking that element reminded him of how unnecessarily she went into details, all out of a sort of hatred. When Jaime told him about Tysha... I was riding on a subway, and I seriously just started tearing up. I already felt so terrible for Tyrion and hateful towards Jaime because of the original Tysha story, but that was too much. I'm glad he was the one to kill Tywin. That was so wonderful.

And Jaime! When I saw that we were going to get his perspective, I was a little thrown off. But man, what a great way to see how complex of a character he is. It was so easy to paint him as the chiseled pretty boy sonuvabitch who threw Bran out the window and didn't give a shit about anyone or anything except for Cersei. And then we have to find out about his inner monologue, his conflicted feelings, and the fact that he really has honor. I couldn't help but love him at the end of the book... all until he told Tyrion the truth about Tysha. It meant a lot that he told Tyrion the truth, but his past continues to haunt him. Being rejected by everyone that he cared about in the end (Cersei, as much as I hate her, was the hardest to deal with, knowing how much he just wants to be with her).

Fuck Joffrey. I wasn't expecting him to go so soon after the Red Wedding, but I was so happy the moment he started coughing.

I can now understand why Arya is so many people's favorite character. I always enjoyed her, but by the end of the book I was convinced that I will someday name my daughter Arya (not in a relationship or anywhere close to parenthood... but she's awesome!). She's grown so much and feels so much older than she is. It doesn't even seem wrong when she kills people anymore. When they ran into the Tickler, I was happy she was going to get to cut down her list. But man, she really went for it! I have a lot of hopes for her in Braavos.

The Craster scene! Oh man... I was really caught off by that. It was utter chaos, and I felt like Sam reading it; I just wanted to run and hide. It was one of my favorite scenes.
So fucking happy for Jon Snow. I mean... sorry about Ygritte (actually really liked her, despite the fact that she must have psychologically damaged Jon with her constant reinforcement of her belief that he knows nothing). But outside of losing her and all of his family, as far as he knew... he's risen up. And I really want to see what he does as Lord Commander.

I was so surprised by Littlefinger... so many times. When Sansa went to him... that he was behind Joffrey's death... when Lysa said that he told her to poison Jon Arryn... when he kills Lysa. I really am in hate with him. I'm glad that he saved Sansa, because she was pretty much fucked (all but literally) and miserably married. But outside of that, he's just a slimy bastard who cares about no one but himself. I mean, sure I knew that already, but not to that degree!

Varys! What the hell is he up to? I sort of believe him when he says that he serves the realm, because there's almost no rhyme or reason to his shifts in loyalty (if you can even call it that). I can't tell if I want him to die or set things straight... meaning that I'm in the same boat as everyone else.

Danaerys. I'm glad that we get to read a lot of the internal struggle she has. Her conflict with having feelings towards different men, as well as really questioning how to make decisions, makes her a much more likeable character and less of an angelic princess (which she's more like in the show, although I still really liked her character from the show). I was sad to see Jonah go even though he betrayed her, because I truly believe that he's changed his ways. But she made the right choice.

I can see why people like Stannis. I really hated him for so long. But he did a great deed by sending men to the Wall, and he is a wise king in his dealings with Davos, at least. I think that Maester Aemon's questions about his sword show that his being the prophet is probably not the case (which I've always suspected, if for no reason than that I hate Melisandre).

Bran's skinshifting gives me hope for the future of House Stark. I don't know how much time will lapse in the course of the series, but I hope to see Bran ruling Winterfell as Ned did, with Jon as Lord Commander, Arya as head of the Kingsguard(?), and Sansa properly married to someone she actually wants to fucking be married to! But of course, that's assuming that Martin has mercy on the Starks moving forward. I want to believe!
But I guess there was a bit of mercy... Catelyn coming back at the end. Oh man... that was too exciting! I can't believe I don't have the next book in front of me right now! That needs to change.

How much of Season 4 do you think will be the second half of this book? There's so much to cover, and all of the cliffhangers are so good, I think it's good enough to fill the entire season. I don't know.

All in all... such a wonderful book. I teared up more in reading this than any book I've read, mostly because of how much I have invested in these characters. God, I love this series. On to the next!

It doesn't matter what ""side"" you believe in.  The comments are repeatedly generating needless drama fights and creating a geek-fan vs. casual-fan rift.  

**This is an *inclusive* subreddit.**  It's perfectly fine for a fan to call her Daenerys, Khaleesi, Dany, Mother of Dragons, or anything else that at least communicates clearly enough to add to the discussion. It's not fine for people to attack first-time posters over pedantic details that have no bearing on the content being posted.  [It's not fine to attack anyone in the subreddit for any reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy)  

So this is the last post about Daenerys vs. Khaleesi names.  It has been added to the [What Not To Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post) list.  Posting about it, causing drama, and attacking other Redditors will get you banned, so don't do it here.  If you see anyone posting like that, please report their comments.

Admittedly I wasn't paying 100% attention during the entire thing (I was cooking myself some dinner and watching it on my laptop) but I can't find much reference to Tyrion's battle. There is this big lead up of the 20,000 Stark men and the Lannisters are basically thinking they are screwed. Then we find there's only 2,000 which are crushed easily but from Rob's perspective we learn that he has won the battle of the Whispering Wood and captured Jamie but at the cost of 2,000 men (the same number lost against Tyrion).
Now according to the wiki's Whispering wood is a complete Stark victory and is a result of Jamie getting careless and falling into a trap. But there is little mention of any battle before that, the wiki mentions a battle of Golden Tooth but there is no mention to it being a trap as Robb hinted. So what was the deal with the battle Tyrion takes part in? Was it Golden Tooth where Edmure is given a beating (a battle where no casualty figure appears to be given) or is it something else entirely?",6,9,False,self,,,,,

Please look away if you haven't completed the books up to A Storm of Swords.

I'm sorry in advance for bad formatting and spoilers.  I generally try to avoid this subreddit because I haven't read past book three and so much has been spoiled for me I can't risk more!  So I dunno if I should mark the spoilers further down, but I'm going to anyway.  

Hardly anyone gets the death they deserve in this series.  But MAN! [Spoiler](#b ""Tyrion got the kill he deserved!  Tywin was finally getting what he had fought for so long!  Then all of his children start acting like children.  I really really really liked Tywin, but I should've know that even a man like him couldn't actually shit gold."") 

Littlefinger.  I guess I should have expected this.  While Varys is like ""I do what I do for the kingdom, gotta serve the realm,"" Littlefinger is all about himself.  I wonder when he found the time to scheme [Yet another](#b ""with Olenna to get rid of Joffrey.  Good fuggin plan, too, might I add."")

The whole using Dontos to get to Sansa - best parts of Sansa's chapters. [And some more](#b ""Promising to take her home, implying that home is Winterfell.  I was 100% he was gonna marry her.  Boy was my mind shattered when he was like ""lol, I'm gonna marry Lysa. Crazy, right?"" The whole rebuilding Winterfell with Sansa made me really really happy and I thought nothing could go wrong. Ooops.  That entire little battle Sansa and Lysa did had me on the edge of my seat as I read in Spanish class.  Poor poor Marillion!  But since Sansa saw all of it unfold, I wonder what she'll do in the future?"")

[MAJOR](#b ""And CATELYN COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD.  ALL HAIL THE RED PRIEST FOR THE IRON THRONE.  MAYBE EVEN BERRIC BECAUSE DAMN. DID NOT SEE THAT COMING, SORRY FOR ALL CAPS I'LL STOP YELLING NOW"")

Please don't tell me anything about the next books, I would like to hear your what it was like for you reading these last few chapters for the first time.

The news of Ned's execution quickly spreads to all corners of the Seven Kingdoms, triggering seismic events for each member of the Stark family. The North secedes from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaims Robb as their King. With Jaime captured by the Starks and Robert's brothers challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne, Lord Tywin Lannister assigns his son Tyrion as King's Hand to keep Joffrey and Cersei in check. Jon plans to desert his post at the Wall to avenge his father; his friends convince him to stay, and he joins the Night's Watch in an expedition to confront the foes massing beyond the Wall. Daenerys learns to her sorrow that her unborn son is dead and her Drogo has been left in a vegetative state due to the witch's treacherous magic. Unable to bear her husband's ruin, Daenerys ends his life and lights a funeral pyre. She burns the witch alive alongside Drogo's body and her three dragon's eggs, and walks into the flames herself as the fire reaches its peak. When the embers die the following morning, Daenerys rises, unharmed, flanked by three newborn dragons.|

Personally I would like Arya to take the throne as she's one of my favourite characters at the moment and I can tell in the future she will get even better, I'd also like to see it go full circle with the Starks ending up back near the top again. However, I think Daenerys will likely take it if she can get a bigger army and control of them pesky dragons!

So, what do you guys think?

Here it goes: So I haven't played the official GOT game yet, but I've heard mixed reviews. I've played a bunch of mods set in the ASOIAF world, however, and was wondering what everyone thinks the next GOT game should look like.

**TL;DR: What would you like to see from the next GOT video game?**


Mine would be something like this:


**Basic Concept**:

Open world fantasy action/RPG (a la Skyrim) with improved combat physics since no magic (think Assassins Creed swordplay, perhaps add mounted combat) with a compelling storyline with 3 main playable characters (a la GTA V). I loved the switching between characters in GTA, and I think it would make so much sense in an ASOIAF game seeing as that is kind of how the books are written. 

**Map:**

In an ideal world, I'd make all of Westeros (and Essos?) the map, but realistically I could see the map being the Crownlands/Kings Landing with most of the Riverlands and maybe some of the Vale. Much of the action would take place in and around King's Landing, but you would be able to travel to all areas outside on foot or on horseback (I like the Red Dead Redemption horse/travel mechanics). Obviously there would be many small towns, castles, camps etc. that could be explored.

**Setting:**

I'd probably place it around the time of Robert's Rebellion. Perhaps starting around the ""kidnapping"" of Lyanna and culminating with the big battle/Sack of KL.

**Characters:**

*Sworn Sword*: House Stark or Baratheon household guard member or something like that. Maybe fights on behalf of the Starks (Brandon at first, then Ned after Brandon is killed). Believes in honor/chivalry. Fights in heavy armor. Missions take place primarily on the field of battle in the Riverlands fighting for Bobby B.

*Sellsword*: Bastard born in the Riverlands perhaps? Think Bronn but even more cocky/crazy/charismatic. Deadpool-esque. Fights for whoever pays. Medium armor? Missions take place in both KL and the outside world, fighting for both sides whenever it serves him.

*Assassin*: Works directly for Varys as one of his ""little birds"". Takes on missions technically on behalf of the Targs, but Varys' motives become muddled in later game. Light armor. Missions take place mostly in KL (especially the Red Keep and its passageways).

As for how the story line would progress: all three characters are actively mixed up in the ""game"", starting as pawns and later as players. Like in GTA V, every so often the characters would be forced to work together or pitted against one another. What do you all think?

My question is concerning Dany's decision to exile Jorah. 

To me, the show hasn't been quite as overt as the book with Jorah's feelings for Dany, going all the way back to ACOK when Jorah kissed her. While it was difficult and I hated it, to me it seemed like she made a good decision to exile him. His feelings began to cloud his judgement, imploring Dany to trust no other man but himself, and even became arrogant toward the end, boasting that the sacking of Meereen was due to him and his party alone. 

I'm curious if Jorah's  impulsiveness will begin to show itself this upcoming season. I can maybe see them kiss in the season preview during a quick shot to build anticipation. I was just curious to hear your thoughts and if you disagreed.",29,15,False,self,,,,,

I'm in the midst of re-watching all of S01. I'm picking up the finer points of the plot line, character motivations, lies vs. truth and noticing which actions have had huge repercussions in later episodes and seasons.

The things that stand out for me are: Arya should have killed Joffrey while sparing with the butcher boy by the river. However, how was she to know what a little prick he turns out to be, so I forgive her. Lady Stark kidnapping Tryion is excusable. She believed he tried to kill her son. OK, fine I get it. But if she didn't do that then The King Slayer doesn't attack Ned and we avoid a big mess later.

What I cannot get past are the actions of Ned Stark in S01E07. Both Renly and Little Finder suggest ways to gain power and protect the Stark family after Robert's death. He chooses ""honor"" and ""tradition"" over logic and cedes power to his enemies. Unforgivable!

My first time through S01 I thought Ned was the honorable protagonist of the story. Now I see him as an untrustworthy, idealistic douche.

I'm not familiar with this subreddit, so I'm not going to go on about how his decision affected things that happen in later episodes. I will say this however. Fuck Ned Stark. Does anyone see things this way?

Wouldn't most people who knew the bastards not even know that they *were* Robert's bastards? 

Edit: Followup question: What was the reasoning in ordering the Kingsguard to kill the bastards in the first place? I've read that it was purely to eliminate the ability for people to compare the hair colors of all of Robert's sons with those of Cersei's children. Which of course might lead one to be suspicious as to why she birthed children with Robert that had blonde hair while every other woman he slept with gave him children of black hair. This could be used to show that Joffrey may not be the rightful heir after all (although to me it would seem very far from ""proof"", especially since there was also no proof that the bastards were actually robert's bastards).

Does this book live up to its predecessors? Or will I have to grit my teeth and just read through it so I can get to book 5?

My complaint is only for the people who listen to the audio books by Roy dotrice. I love his voice acting for the first three books, he is amazing! But His voice for Arya has completely changed in this book, totally new accent, it really breaks the immersion for me because I've known her voice to be very different for the past few months.

I think these will be the most remarable scenes in Season 4 I can remeber. But I cant think of much stuff happening before EP 4... could you guys fill this up? I Think most stuff here will be really likely to take place in the specific episode...

EP1: Jaime Lord Commander / Jaime &amp; Cersei / Brienne &amp; Loras  / ?

EP2: Arya and the Hound kill people  / ?

EP3: Arya escapes the Hound / ?

EP4: Purple Wedding / Joffrey's Death / Sansa escapes (Considering the fact that this stuff already appeared on a shooting shedule for Episode 4) 

EP5: Tyrion is being arrested / Arya sails to Braavoes / ?

EP6: Tyrion's Trials with Mace, Oberyn and Tywin questioning Shae / ?

EP7: Viper vs. The Mountain Fight / ?

EP8: Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin and Shae / Arya arrives in Braavos / ?

EP9: Wildings attack the Wall / Stannis comes to ""rescue"" the wall  (Considering Neil Marshall will direct this Episode and he already directed the giant Blackwater-Battle. Most likely he will also direct THIS giant battle then...) / Cersei assigns Qyburn as the new Maester  /?

EP10: Daenerys enters Mereen / Jon becomes the new Commander / Littlefinger &amp; Lysa / Tyrion arrives across the Narrow Sea / ?

I know i forgot loads of stuff probably but you can help me to fill / and remeber all the stuff I forgot if you like. What do you guys think?

[ASOS] (#b ""In the show, they only focus on Davos and The Red Lady during Stannis story lines, where as in the book there are a lot of minor characters mentioned, for example Godry Farring ""Giantslayer"".I was thinking that in the show, they should have Stannis slay a giant during the Battle Beneath the Wall to redeem his character. In the novel, I don't recall Stannis ever fighting during the Battle of Blackwater in ACOK, but the show-runners had his character as the first to storm the beaches which made him such a bad ass"")]

Anyway, I know that my opinions are not the universal opinions of all ASOIAF fans, and Im perfectly okay with that, but I want to break down why I cant stand Jorah Mormont and hear why some of you love him. So heres my analysis of Jorah the Andal. I hope this leads to some intelligent debate.

           
Jorahs history is pretty treacherous to begin with. He fell into financial despair trying to make his uppity wife Lynesse happy so he decided to sell poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. Eddard Stark went to Bear Island to put Ice through his neck and Jorah fled. He could have taken the black or demanded a trial by combat but he ran away with his tail between his legs.   


Now the exiled knight is desperate to get his lordship, castle, and honor back. So what does he do? He sells out Daenerys to Varys and Bobby B. He is a snitch. That is unforgivable in my book. Yes, I know that Varys ends up (maybe) being a secret Targaryen supporter but Jorah didnt know that. He sold her out. There was an assassination attempt on her life because he wanted his lordship back. Yes, I know that he was there to stop the attempt but that doesnt clear his name. Once a snitch, always a snitch, those are the rules.  

 
Jorah then falls in love with Dany and becomes a jealous control freak, trying to keep other men away from her, constantly reminding her that he is the only one she can trust. When he admits his treachery to her, she sends him packing. He becomes a broken man, a shell of his former self, and while fucking silver-haired prostitutes in a brothel, schemes of ways to win back her favor.  Near the end of ADWD, he attempts to get the Second Sons to go back over to Danys side.  


So, hes a slaver and a snitch and his one redeeming quality is that he would now do anything (even die) for the queen he once wronged. How could she ever trust him again? That assassination attempt was on him. Snitches get stitches. That is all.  


Okay, so what do you folks think? Why do you like Jorah Mormont? Have you forgiven him?

They say that Lysa Arryn lived in King's Landing with Jon Arryn while Jon Arryn was the hand, and I assume their son was there as well.  Catelyn is upset that Robert asked Ned to be the hand because Ned would have to leave Winterfell and they would be apart.  My question is, why doesn't Catelyn take the younger children (or all of them, doesn't really matter) and go to King's Landing with Ned, like Lysa and Jon Arryn did?  

I thought it might have been because Bran gets injured and Catelyn wants to wait for him to wake up, but that's not right because she was upset about Ned leaving before that happened.  The only reason I can come up with is that Lysa had Brynden Tully to look after the Vale (I think he was there anyway?) and Robb isn't old enough to look after Winterfell.  This isn't a solid enough reason for me though as I'm sure someone could have done it.",23,8,False,self,,,,,

The prophecy involving Cersei being killed by her Valonqar, which translates to younger brother. Of course most people assume this Tyrion, since he and Cersei already have a very strained realtionship and because Tyrion killed Tywin already. We know this can't happen though since Tyrion is in Essos, and now with the Second Sons in Mereen. But GRRM has foreshadowed that Jaime is the more likely candidate. GRRM has stated before that Cersei came out before Jaime did, which makes him younger than Cersei; thus being her little brother in a sense. Though Jaime is off in the riverlands, we know that when he receives Cersei's plea for help, he disregards it entirely. That right there could make him the cause of Cersei's death, though indirectly and not in the sense that most people would expect. The sudden appearance of ""Robert Strong"" does make us wonder if she really will die though. We know how competent Gregor is in combat, so it's likely that the reincarnated him can defeat whoever the opposition is. That kind of brings us back to the drawing board, since we know Jaime's sword training isn't going well at all and wouldn't be able to defeat Gregor on a good day. Thoughts?

TL;DR Who do you guys think will be the Valonqar, why, and how do you think it'll play out?",29,18,False,self,,,,,

Haven't watched Season 3 yet. Haven't read books 4 or 5 yet.

I definitely misspell a lot of character's names. I'm too mad to look it up! 

Okay, I'l start with Tyrion and George Martin. To Mr. Martin I say, No! No! Nu-uh. I don't buy it. When you find out your one and only true love in this world ACTUALLY loved you back the whole time, you don't get mad at the messenger, you thank him. First he saves your life then he tells you your true love loves you back. That is so wrong. I didn't like that, but I guess then he wouldn't have been motivated to kill Shae and Tywin. 

Second, I was told no more deaths after Joeffrey! But everybody more dies! Holy crap! Shae, Tywin, Lysa! The only one that felt good to me was Lysa. That was satisfying. That was totally unexpected and felt good 'cause she was too pyscho for this world. Which brings me to Petyr... but that has to wait.

Third, freaking SHAE! You know why I don't like this? Because she is SO devoted to Tyrion in the TV Show. And he didn't give her a chance. He didn't let her speak. And it's not HER fault she values her own life! He hired her! How is that Shae's fault?! Ugh. That was unjust. And Tyrion had always been just, up til that moment. And then he kills his father. Not Cersei, the one who's been trying to kill him, but Tywin. Also seems wrong. Really wrong. I didn't like it. I dunno. I feel bad about the whole thing. I guess that's what 30+ years (how old is tyrion?) of torment and mockery will do to you. On the other hand, Tyrion is spoiled. He's the most powerful dwarf the world has probably ever seen (i'm guessing). He was hand of the kind. He has so much handed to him because he's a lannister and gets away with so much for the same reason. He got petulant. 

Okay, Jamie. I like Jaime! He saves Brienne. He saves Tyrion. He's ruthless and heartless and in some ways psychotic, but... but... I like him! He's blunt. He doesn't pretend to not be a bastard. He's the only one who's that way. I've always liked him. 

Ugh, so much. Okay, who else? Arya! Why did you leave the Hound? Why? Hound! Why are you so ungrateful and macho?! Get over yourself. They should've stuck together. I'm sad about that. [warning scope](#g ""Also, I'm not convinced The Hound is dead. Mr Martin likes to be obvious when he closes the book on a character. Like with Brenn (is that his name? tyrion's sellsword first guard) when he visited Tyrion in the tower before the trial, they talked and Brehn(?) Brahn(?) rejects Tyrion's offer, Martin wrote something like ""And he walked out of the cell, and out of his life."" Subtle like a sledgehammer. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Hound pop up again in the next book or maybe the one after."")

Okay, Littlefinger. Petyr, Petyr, Petyr. So evil. Truly. He's the most evil character in this whole series, I think. Joeffrey was cruel and dumb, Jamie is cold and selfish, Dany's late brother was a brat, Janos Slynt and Ser Allison have no power and thus are insignificant, The Mountain is evil but also powerless and [warning scope](#g""dead"") dying... Petyr Littlefinger. No one else is so awful as him. All due to love scorned. And a power thirst. What he does is beyond sense or forgiveness. Oh, sure, I'm happy he killed Lady Lysa, but that doesn't make him less evil. It wasn't enough to kill her, he had to tell her he's always preferred Cat over her. He lies and lies and lies and lies. Everything he says is a lie. I can't stand a liar the way Littlefinger is a liar. They're the worst kind of scum in this world. The worst. 

Thank all the gods, the old and the new for Jon Snow! Jon Snow, the new lord commander of the Wall... [warning scope](#g ""how long is that gonna last, I wonder?"") So, since I started GoT with the TV show [no spoilers], not the books, I always disliked Jon Snow. The actor who plays him is whiney and pouty. Totally unlikeable. But in the book! I am loving Jon Snow.[warning scope](#g ""Please don't kill him, Martin. Please. I mean, I know you're going to 'cause you killed Eddard, then Robb, now it's Jon on top, so it's his turn to die."") But... come on. Don't be that predictable. Please?

I have nothing to say about the epilogue. That's a lie. I have too much to say. As unsatisfying as Joeffrey's death (because we didn't get to watch him die by the sword of Robb or Arya Stark shouting FOR WINTERFELL), so is Catlyn's return. She seems a ghoul. It's wrong. I don't like it. It means that now (almost) anyone who dies can come back to life. And that will ruin all the suspense of this whole series. If people can come back from the dead, people who were clearly, very, very dead. Like bloated in a river for a day, dead. Then... what's the point? Why do I have to worry about anything ever again? The lightning lord will just bring them back to life. No. I don't like it. 

So, now I'm feeling pretty good about the whole run of the series though. Arya is free and (I'm assuming) [warning scope](#g ""going to learn the way of the shape shifters. Probably she'll run into Tyrion or something. Oh no, wait, she wanted to be sent to the wall? Shoot, then, I dunno. She'll never make it though, that'd be too easy."") Bran is studying to become a great and all-powerful wargy-wizard. And Jon Snow is commander of the Wall. So basically, [warning scope] (#g ""Jon Snow is clearly destined to die a ruthless and unexpected death. Dany Targarean is gonna swoop along with her super dragons and rule everybody until Arya and Bran will come riding in with their warg-powers and Nimonarnoir's (what's her wolf's name again?) fat pack and Bran's (probably) collected army of mammoths and giants and superpowers-- who pass through the wall by permission of Samwell Tarly of the future-- and save everyone and rule everything. forever. The End!"")

[warning scope](#g ""HEAR THAT MARTIN?! ARYA AND BRAN WIN! ESPECIALLY ARYA! Bran can die. A noble sacrifice. Whatever. BUT DON'T FUCK WITH ARYA, MAN! I WILL WARG YOUR ASS!"")",13,0,False,self,,,,,

To Cersei's dismay, Tyrion takes up his post as acting Hand at King's Landing. At Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon proclaims allegiance to Melisandre's new god and lays public claim to the Iron Throne, revealing Joffrey's bastardry. As this news reaches the capital, the Gold Cloaks slaughter Robert's bastards. Having won three victories, Robb Stark offers the Lannisters peace in exchange for the North's independence, sending Theon to gain Balon Greyjoy's support and Catelyn to seek Renly Baratheon's. Beyond the Wall, the Night's Watch find shelter with the Wildling Craster and his daughter-wives. In Essos, as her people slowly die in the Red Waste, Daenerys sends out riders to look for help.|

* **This is a TV Spoiler-friendly zone:** This is a rewatch series, so if you are here then it is assumed that you have already seen the entire series at least once.  Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including 3.10 is ok without spoiler tags.
* **Book spoilers still need tags:** If it's not in the show, [tag it](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).
* **Please read the [spoiler policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

As he showed during his time at Harrenhall, he is a master assassin. He is incredibly observant and seemingly cannot be snuck up on. He is able to kill anyone he wants without ever being detected. On top of this, he has access to some pretty neat magic powers, such as being able to change his face at will (and likely other stuff we don't know about yet). 

So I've wondered for a while now, *how on earth did he get captured in the first place??*

When we first saw Jacquen in the cage, we didn't know anything about him, but looking back, I am very confused why he was there. All of the men in Harrenhall couldn't catch him while he was killing people at will for Arya, so how did he get arrested before? On top of that, he would have died in the fire, still stuck in the cage, if Arya hadn't thrown them an axe. I find it very hard to believe that he would have been unable to get out of there by himself. It just doesn't make sense to me that a Faceless Man would either get captured or be unable to free himself, given what else we've seen of him, and furthermore, it seems unlikely to me that he was carrying out some secret plan, because he would have died had Arya not saved him.

I don't know about you all but I'm really excited for this and have been wanting to get more detail on this Civil War for a while.  Hopefully it wil provide as much insight into the ""Dance of the Dragons"" as Dunk and Egg have given us into the ""Blackfyre Rebellion"".

Now I obviously know Dany is going to have some problems with him and I have no doubts she will also die and Aegon will end the books by sitting on the throne while everyone is dead and the author basically wasted writing 4 books about irrelevant characters. I mean doesnt this bother anyone else? If Dany sits on the throne then itll make more sense because we saw her progress and what she did to reclaim the throne.

Once Stannis had Storms End he would have a foothold in Westeros and he could be a dual threat from the sea and from land. I know Renley held Storms end until his death but what is happening in Storms End now? Is it empty? Does it support the King or Stannis since they are both supposedly Baratheon? 

Really we don't know what happened to Renley's forces, the Tyrells joined the King. But is Renley's men just held up in Storms End refusing to follow the King's rule or join Stannis? 

Also, why doesn't the King just lay siege to Dragonstone? They could starve out Stannis and finish him off, surely they have enough ships between the Tyrells, the Lannisters, and the royal fleet.

We know that Jaime Lannister slayed the Mad King while a member of his King's Guard. This led to the ouster of the Targaryen's and Robert Baratheon seized the throne. But that raises a couple of questions.

1) What drove Jaime to kill the King, and why was he not executed?


2) If it was a Lannister power move to seize the throne from the family Targaryen, why did Robert become King, and not Jaime or Tywin?

John Snow would have a white direwolf on Gray, a Frey bastard would have gray towers on blue, so on and so forth.  House Blackfyre is a legitimate house, being the result of Dameon Blackfyre's legitimization by his father.

Since house Blackfyre was founded by a legitimized bastard, they use as their sigil a reversed Targaeryen sigil, a black dragon on red.

But, even though we don't know of a case where this happened, what sigil would a bastard from house Blackfyre bear?

It stands to logic that they would inverse their colors, but in their period of history that would mean that they, as a bastard of a cadet house, would bear the same sigil as the king and the royal family, which seems unlikely.

For those of you unfamiliar with Madden, you can basically create your own players and team. We plan on making our own team, complete with characters from the books and show.

Our question is, where do most characters fit? We generally go by size and personality. Not sure what to do at quarterback or where to put Jorah Mormont.

Here's what we have so far:

**Head Coach**

Tywin Lannister

**Hand of the Coach**

Jon Arryn

**Quarterback**

Rhaegar Targaryen / Ned Stark --this one is a big question mark

**Running Back**

Tyrion Lannister (small and elusive)

**Wide Receiver**

Jaime Lannister [Season 3](#s ""at least before he got his hand chopped off"")

Oberyn Martell

Barristan Selmy

**Tight End**

Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully

**Fullback**

Davos Seaworth

**Tackles**

Gregor Clegane

Hodor

**Guards**

Sandor Clegane

Jeor Mormont

**Center**

Samwell Tarly

**Defensive End**

Robert Baratheon

Khal Drogo

**Defensive Tackle**

Strong Belwas

Illyrio Mopatis (book version)

**Outside Linebackers**

Renly Baratheon

Loras Tyrell

**Middle Linebacker**

Stannis Baratheon

**Cornerback**

Jon Snow

Joffrey Baratheon

**Safety**

Beric Dondarrion

Theon Greyjoy

**Punter**

Viserys Targaryen

**Kicker**

Lancel Lannister

I know her favorite characters are Daenerys (she only knows her as Khaleesi) and Robb Stark.

Feel free to link up pictures of previous home-made gifts if you think they might be appropriate for a 50-year-old somewhat-conservative mother (I am capable/crafty, but I am on a budget).

That being said there is always usually precedence and ultimately justification for a character being killed, even it's just wrong place at the wrong time, mouthing off etc. I don't picture George looking at a character and simply saying well I think i'll kill them, rather in terms of the larger picture and relativity to the story the deaths are always a realistic outcome. That being said, as a reader investing all this time in these characters, whose death would frustrate you the most/ leave you upset for a lack of pay-off etc.

I think Daenerys would be a top vote. Tyrion as well. Either one of these two going within the next two books would be a major disappointment for fans, depending of course on the circumstance and such. I think though i'm more intrigued by where Bran's story is going, and he's had the most curiosity and building in my mind as to how his role will pan out. Killing him (which would be hard to justify anyway) would probably be a series breaker for me. I think we can say Danerys and the Starks are safe at least through the next book, but with so much character building this series has yet to truly reach it's climax, who do you think won't make it through the end of the series and whose death would bother you/frustrate you the most?",146,36,False,self,,,,,

Returning to his home of Pyke after nine years as the Starks' ward, Theon Greyjoy is reunited with his sister, Yara, and his father, Balon, who despises Theon for his Northern ways and intends to win back his crown by force. Cersei rejects Robb Stark's terms and Tyrion exiles Janos Slynt, head of the Gold Cloaks, to the Wall, promoting Bronn to commander of the watch. On the road to the Wall, Arya reveals her true identity to Gendry. North of the Wall, Samwell Tarly is approached by one of Craster's daughters, Gilly, who is pregnant and fears for her unborn child; Jon is reluctant to help her despite Sam's pleas. In the Red Waste one of the horses returns to Daenerys with the decapitated head of its rider in a pouch, a message from one of her enemies. On Dragonstone, Davos Seaworth recruits the pirate Salladhor Saan to Stannis's side, and Stannis has sex with Melisandre to obtain the son his wife could not give him. Jon discovers that Craster sacrifices his sons to the White Walkers.|

That means AFFC &amp; ADWD will be one- 1.5 seasons. The more I think about it, the more this makes sense. I would much rather have the final two seasons just focus on the final two books and clearly establish the climax &amp; ending.
AFFC &amp; ADWD-

   Cersei's paranoia, sparring with Margaery and capture by the religious order, a single season.

   Jon's dealings as lord commander, advising Stannis and betrayal by his brothers, single season.

  Brianne's ""adventures in walking in circles"", wait, if this is season 5 what the hell is she gonna do all season 4? ( I think her Feast storyline might be moved to next season, or they invent something for her to do.)

   Jaime's breakup with Cersei, dealings with Riverrun ...this can all fit in a single season.

   Dany, do we even wanna go there? She does NOTHING in Mereen till she takes a ride on Drogon.....one season, easy.

   The Greyjoys are gonna get reworked big, some say they might move Vic story over to Asha/Yara ( a shame since I am a big Vic fan ) Euron can visit the drowned god permanently IMHO.

   The Martells, oh boy. The Red Viper is a must, but Doran, Arianne and the Sand snakes? I have a bad feeling about them making it. And forget about Quentin, his story was kinda neat and self contained but not needed.

  The funny things is GRRM said that he thinks AFFC &amp; ADWD need two seasons each because ""so much happens in them"". lmao",2,0,False,default,,,,,

I haven't got to reading all of the books yet, but I am really enjoying the show, fan arts, interviews with the actors etc, etc...
The story is very well thought out and portrayed into the tv series (mind the few changes here and there), yet there is one very important thing that's bothering me, and it is on my mind constantly since watching the episode of ""The Red Wedding"".
Now please don't take to heart what i'm going to write next, I know it's way to early to say anything because season 4 hasn't even come out yet, I'm just expressing my own thoughts and opinions, I hope not to offend anyone (I'm going to try to make this as short as possible). So we have Ned Stark who believes in honor and what's right, and sticks to the Kings word (mind the idea of assassinating Daeneyrs) till almost the very end, until his own life is about to be taken away from him. I think we can all agree that the Stark's in general are the characters who try to follow what's morally right. I think I can also say that the Lannister's are the house that's doing the exact opposite, or in other words they are corrupted and almost entirely evil, except for a few characters that entirely change their personalities eventually due to drastic events, or so I've seen so far. Ned Stark eventually looses his war against Cersei, on who has the right to sit on the iron throne.This leads with Ned paying with his own life for ""treason"" (which it wasn't because Joffrey was an incest child born between Jamie and Cersei, obviously not the rightful heir to become king). Hearing news of his father being put in the dungeons King's Landing, Rob Stark takes an army with him to go and try to save him and his sisters, this eventually leads with him dying as well because of a stab in the back by Walder Frey. So to sum it all up Ned Stark dies in vane for what's right. Rob stark, Lady Cat died in vane for what's right, Bran looses his legs to the Lannisters.  now even horrendous rumors of Jon Snow's death have come to me lol....  All I'm trying to figure out here is what message is the author trying to send out... Let's put aside the saying (if you play the game of thrones you either win or you die). all I can interpret here is that believing and fighting for what's right leads you to dying a horrible death, so everyone should be afraid of doing that and never attempt it. Bad people 1 - good people 0. I know it's way to early to come to conclusions, but so far that's what I see :-( 
Hope to see some feedback :-)",21,0,False,self,,,,,

But in the books, she still lives on. Reading the last chapter in AFOC atm, and she is talking with Jaimie and all. And her mother says that ""she made sure that the baby was gone."" Was Jeyne stabbed in the stomach but survived?

In the book, when they leave to plead with lord Greyjoy she also stays back at Riverrun.

So who was at the Twins, did the TV show do something wrong or was the person in the TV Show someone else? The Red Wedding chapter did not say anything about being stabbed in the stomach too as far as I remember.

So, like many of you, I heard that the show creators don't want to do flashbacks. There are ideas, however, that Bran's weirwood visions don't count as flashbacks, and hopefully we will still get to see some early moments of certain characters and their lives.

Do you guys (and gals) think they will include Ned praying for Jon and Robb to grow ""as brothers"" with love? If they do, will it be with a young actor or Sean Bean with make-up and coloring? Which would you prefer?

&gt; **Cordel literature** are popular and inexpensively printed booklets or pamphlets containing folk novels, poems and songs, which are produced and sold in fairs and by sidestreet vendors in the Northeast of Brazil. They are so named because they are hung from strings in order to display them to potential clients. They form one of the least altered continuations of the Western traditions of popular literature, such as chapbooks, and popular prints. This genre of literature was also found in Spain during the 18th and 19th centuries, and offered readers a wide array of topics, from basic instruction to political tracts.""

I want to start reading the series again but I don't really have much time to devote to reading so I'd rather start with new content. From what I understand, Season 3 was approximately the first half of the third book. Does anybody have suggestions on where I should start reading in order to not get lost by the differences but also start of with mostly new content? Has anybody tried anything similar to this - does it even work to pick up the book halfway in?

The first two books/seasons followed fairly well, with a tiny bit of interspersing.

  However, I noticed that a few things in the beginning of the season weren't in the book, so I decided to read AFFC. (And even then, they took stuff from ADWD and put it in Season 3), A grueling 3 weeks later, I finished it. So then I finished watching season 3 last night.

I'm specifically discussing the Red Wedding, but this topic is open to all book/TV show differences discussion. I'm not sure how I felt about one major change in the TV show from the book, and that's Jeyne Westerling being present at the wedding.

In the book, it was bad enough. I stopped reading for three days after that chapter. However, the presence of Jeyne at the wedding in the TV show was heart wrenching. I don't have any fellow readers to discuss this with IRL, so I turn to reddit. What did you guys think about adding her to the wedding in the TV show? Was the extra drama necessary? 

When it first showed her at the Twins, I was apprehensive about her being there, but curious to see how it turned out. When the Red Wedding was initiated though, I immediately felt sick to my stomach before Robb or Catelyn we're even killed. It was, by far, one of the hardest scenes to watch in TV history.

Catelyn Stark arrives at King Renly's camp to negotiate an alliance, and the woman warrior Brienne of Tarth wins the right to join Renly's guard. Tyrion crafts a plan to find who is in Cersei's confidence by proposing three different marriages to the members of the Small Council. At Winterfell, Bran Stark needs help to decipher his dreams. On the road to the wall, the band of Night's Watch recruits are attacked by Lannister soldiers.|

I would love to hear your guys opinions on the division of land, shipping routes, colours, etc...

My plan is to create castles for some of the major cities. These castles will be garrison-able so you can loose the territory but not the city. 

I have made this in layers in photoshop so the majority of it can be changed without much effort.

So I've been watching other movies with the ""medieval/fantasy, knights, lord &amp; lady"" theme. This morning I happened to catch Sean Connery &amp; Richard Gere in ""First Knight"" from 1995 (yes, horribly cheesy but still good IMO). Anyhow, I saw a couple of familiar faces:

A young Ralph Ineson, who plays Dagmer Cleftjaw (Theon Greyjoy's first mate who ""eggs him on"" to take Winterfell, behead Ser Rodrick, and a number of other things); plays the part of Ralf, a bad guy in First Knight.

A VERY young looking Liam Cunningham, who plays Ser Davos, the Onion Knight in GOT, plays the part of Agravaine, one of the knights of the round table.

Has anyone else noticed any other GOT actors playing in this type movie? To see them in another medieval/fantasy genre movie is like spotting an old friend across the room at a cool club. Awesome!

Some of you may have seen the very talented Adam Fisher's detailed [3D bust of Tywin Lannister](http://th05.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/241/0/c/tywin_lannister_by_adam_fisher-d6k5m1j.jpg). Adam is working with me to create a 1/6th scale action figure of Tywin Lannister. I have agreed to complete a Tywin costume to go along with Adam's head sculpt. I'm having a good friend, who is a talented seamstress, create the costume. I will then send photos to all of the interested parties and we can go from there.

Unfortunately, Tywin's costume cannot include a set of his armor. It is simply too pricy to be sculpted and produced. Instead, the costume will be Tywin in one of his more regal outfits.

The figure will include an unpainted Tywin Lannister head sculpt, and a full Tywin Lannister costume including his pin, belt, sash, and boots. The unpainted head will allow you to seek out the artist of which you prefer, as some artists are more affordable than others. I have many 1/6th scale artist contacts I can share, or you can find your own. A 1/6th scale body can be included, though I have not determined which body will be the most accurate while remaining affordable. I will have this sorted before completing the figure. Or, you can purchase your own body, if you wish. If you choose to do so, the price for what I'm offering will be less for you.

Speaking of price, I would very much like to keep the price below $200, but it may go above that slightly. So, without a definite price, who is interested in purchasing a Tywin Lannister figure?

For those of you who are interested, please respond to this thread or send me a PM. Just know by adding your name to this list, you are not bound by any means to purchase one. No money will be collected until the costume has been completed, at which point I may collect a small deposit to confirm the number that need to be made. I think I am going to limit the number of pieces to 25, but should interest exceed 25, there will be a wait list for inevitable drop outs. Or perhaps we will raise the production number!

[Here](http://youtu.be/nUe2IHN_isU) is a video of Adam's work on Tywin, for those interested.

Anyway, thanks, everyone! Please post any questions and I will be glad to answer them.

I think there is something they haven't really explained in the series that is possibly explained in the books.

People call Jaime Lannister the ""King Slayer"" in an attempt to ridicule or demoralize him. But in the show it seems widely understood the king he killed needed killing. They only speak of how crazy he was and even call him the ""Mad King"".

My guess is that not everyone in the Seven Kingdoms is aware of the Mad King's actions, so they simply see Jaime as a traitor to the throne. So the nickname ""King Slayer"" just kind of caught on. But to the best of my knowledge, this is never touched on.

Somebody help me understand! Thanks!
