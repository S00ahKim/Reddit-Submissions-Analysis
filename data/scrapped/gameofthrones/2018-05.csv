the progression of the vision is as follows: 
1. Masters handling Wildfire
2. Aerys on the throne saying ""burn them all""
3. the scene of Wildfire traveling under kings landing towards the sept when Cersei blows it up (foreshadowing) 
4. Jamie walking towards the throne to kill the mad king
5. Ned saying ""Where's my sister"" (words more important than it being Ned) 
6. Lyanna's dead body (importance is her being the sister) and her blood on Ned's hand (sister's blood on the brother's hand)
7. Jamie stabbing the mad king in the back
So here is my point. If you replace the mad king with the mad queen (as it is clear Cersei is going mad), you can reimagine the ""Kingslayer"" scene it being Cersei. Then, if you listen to Ned's words ""where is my sister""  as if it was Jamie asking when he comes to kill her (or asking philosophically because she is essentially a changed person that he doesn't recognize.) since then it shows the brother with his sister's blood on his hands (""he will wrap his hands around your neck""), that means Cersei's blood will be on Jamie's hand(s). Not to mention it is  Jamie stabbing the person on the iron throne in the back... all of this together could confirm that Jamie will kill Cersei... and I'm just going to leave it there.

When the NK origin and motivations are revealed it will be built on stories that were already told. The reveal of the NK will inform events we have already seen/read rather than add an entirely new mythos to GoT. This is a carefully crafted story based on incredibly detailed source material from GrrM. D&amp;B would have known the NK origin from the start as GrrM did and would have woven it into the story since he is such a primary threat. Knowing this and having faith in all of them I think they have.

* Disclaimer:

D&amp;B used the source material so some answers might be in the books, some on the screen. I think D&amp;B might have streamlined the concept of the NK and combined/modified legends \(Last Hero and Azor Ahai\) or characters \(Lady Stoneheart and Coldhands\) etc but we will end up in roughly the same ending and motivations as GrrM books. So I think we can take from the books to a degree to unravel the mystery of the show. But I think things like Coldhands \(GrrM insisted it isn't Jon's uncle in the books and I don't think it is\), 13th lord commander/Night's King, Lady Stoneheart along with the Last Hero were omitted/modified to make the story simpler for TV where books can be far more intricate. 

This quote from GrrM most influences my analysis of the NK even in GoT more than anything else:

**""Its not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, theyre really ugly. These are some of the things that Tolkien did; he made them work fabulously, but in the hands of his imitators, they become total clichs. I mean the orc\-like creatures who always do dress in black and... theyre really ugly and theyve got facial deformities or something. You can tell that if somebodys ugly, he must be evil.""**

To me this is the single most important statement about the story as a whole and the NK. If this does not speak to the NK, I don't know what does. He is literally saying that the ""demonic beast of pure evil"" is not what he wants to do. 

* So I think the final big shock will be the Night King isn't truly evil, just someone who was twisted and is opposed to Westeros but with very good cause. Taking the above quote into account I can't see how the NK can just be a Sauron type, not with all the three dimensional evil villains in Westeros GrrM created.

This idea came to me while looking over many other theories and it ties several of them together. I won't go into all the evidence of each theory since that would take a lot of time and most of you have already watched or read the same theories videos and posts and this will be long enough. I'll just be relating how I think they may interact in relation to my theory. I was looking for something that tied all of the below together.

This theory occurred to me while rewatching episode one. 

Opening Episode \- The NK started his move south which resulted in Ned beheading a deserter in the beginning of GoT. This tells us two things, the dead are coming after thousands of years and Starks believe in **Oath's to a fault.** Since what Ned was being told was true and important but Ned \(the moral center of the story in most people's opinion\) cut his head off anyway. 

My theory speaks to this one scene, in the first episode the seeds of the destruction of the Starks are sewn when the Lannisters arrive and the NK had begun his march after thousands of years of relative inaction just prior. Something from the story we are watching is driving him because otherwise he would be truly unconnected from the narrative and I don't think that is the case. 

The one thing that seems to differentiate this moment in time from all others in Westeros history is the Starks have been moved from Winterfell, they had an unbroken line for as long as their history seems to exist but now that a Stark is no longer in Winterfell does the Night King move and winter comes. The fact the show is based around the destruction of the Starks can't be a coincidence with the NK just choosing now to arrive.  

*  I think the constant betrayal and mistreatment of the Starks resulting in them losing Winterfell and the NK deciding to finally attack are connected.  

D&amp;B either made an error or knew what they were doing when the dragon was pulled from ice with chains. I think they knew what they were doing. I think the NK can see the future to a degree and he knew the Stark's would fall when Jon Arryn died, the inciting incident of the story. So why would he care about Jon/Dany or the Starks? 

A few theories would tie this together:

*  The Last Hero is the Night King \- The Last Hero isn't really a thing in the show like the 13th lord commander but I think the basic concept of a man fighting the undead \(Azor Ahai possibly in the show to ""streamline"" it\) will end up in one form or another merged together in a flashback.

 ***So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient*** [***magics***](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Magic) ***could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white*** [***spiders***](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ice_spider) ***big as hounds.***

I think something like this will happen in flashback similar to Jon's trek to fight the NK \(minus the spiders for budget\) but it will end with the man we saw getting dragonglass shoved in his chest and then resurrecting his dozen companions. 

The COTF were losing and in desperation used a scorched earth weapon, the Wights that would kill all the men \(possibly COTF also, as a doomsday weapon\) but leave their trees intact \(which I think they value more than their own lives\). 

I think the Wights needed to be controlled or might have been controlled already by an evil man \(the bearded leader of the Wights we saw in the cave painting, I doubt our NK shaved\) and they needed a replacement Night King to stop them. 

The Last Hero \(probably AA in the show\) underwent the process \(like Coldhands in the show, who was streamlined into Jon's uncle to make the NK origin simpler, since I think he is tied to it\) and became the NK. 

* The Last Hero had to battle and defeat the prior NK for control of his armies. Once he had control and was the NK he could order them north and ""save mankind."" 

So Beric was wrong when he told Jon they only needed to kill the NK, beating the NK might stop the Wights he made himself but I don't think it stops the other White Walkers. I think GrrM and D&amp;B are messing with the fans to make them think there is a death star style simple solution. 

Maybe the Last Hero was the very first NK in the books and there is a long line of them like in Westeros history but in the show they are making only one or two \(following the original bearded leader?\) of them to simplify it. That is why there is Nights King and Night King confusion with GrrM and the 13th lord commander etc, even saying the original NK is like a myth and won't even appear in the books. Its probably too much to get into.

**""As for the Night's King \(the form I prefer\), in the books he is a legendary figure, akin to Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder, and no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have.""** 

I think the main thrust will be, the NK moniker is a curse and you need to defeat him to take control of his army and stop them from wiping out Westeros.

Now what would the Last Hero/Night King want if he was to do something so horrible to himself in return from Westeros? 

* Last Hero/NK is a Stark/Targ bastard child and also ""Lightbringer""
* Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa were Stark and Targ descendants \- 

There are videos out there and posts that suppose NK was a Stark bastard  \(Jon Snow is an evil name north of the wall\). Again we have the issue of show vs book and the fact that the lore has many holes in it on purpose. Without going into other posts \(and people can read or watch the youtube videos to see if they agree\). At that time Starks and Targs might not have existed but they do mention dragonsteel so it is possible their descendants and blood did.  

**A Feast for Crows \- At** [**Castle Black**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Castle_Black) [**Samwell Tarly**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Samwell_Tarly) **tells** [**Jon Snow**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow) **that he found one account of the** [**Long Night**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Long_Night) **that spoke of the last hero slaying** [**Others**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others) **with a blade of** [**dragonsteel**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonsteel)**. Supposedly they could not stand against it. Jon wonders if dragonsteel refers to** [**Valyrian steel**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_steel)**.**

Might not be Targ's but Targ descendants could have been present at that time and the Last Hero/AA had a sword derived from their magic so he might have their blood. So suppose this person was a descendent of the Stark and Targs and also a bastard like Jon which would be the cyclical history of Westeros. 

* They had a union of Ice and Fire to create Lightbringer \(not a forge but a childbirth, there are videos that talk about how the sword is used often by GrrM as a euphemism for male anatomy and sex\). Azor Ahai would be the father of the Last Hero/Lightbringer in the books possibly but the show might just eliminate all this and make Azor Ahai the Last Hero and Lightbringer in a flashback essentially the same legend and merge all the lore for simplicity. 

The joke on the show being the Melissandre is seeing ""Snow"" as AA but it's not Jon Snow, it's actually the NK's original name. He was Azor Ahai \(book version Last Hero\), not Dany or Jon. But Jon can take his place...because he has the right mix of blood.  

* Only a child of Ice and Fire can control the army of the dead. The ""song"" of ice and fire controls the dead.  

The NK could have been looking for a replacement and that is why he keeps converting Crasters babies, he was hoping one would be able to take his place but it never worked. But I think only a child of ice and fire can lead the army of the dead and maybe he finally figured that out when he saw Jon at Hardhome. He could be fixated on Jon as his replacement, that might have been the cause of the stare\-down. 

So in addition to removing the curse what would the NK want and why move south now? If it was just Jon he would have attacked right after Lyanna gave birth or at any point since then. If you were ok being an evil dark ice lord to save westeros what changed your mind? What is a motivation that could make him different than a Sauron?

* Westeros is full of Oathbreakers:

Like Jon, the Last Hero/AA wanted to save his family. So this Stark bastard could have said something like this to the other leaders of Westeros knowing how they murder and cheat each other out of land before setting out to find the COTF and save Westeros from the White Walkers:

* I'll go but a **Stark must always be in Winterfell.** All the great houses \(or their descendants\) owe me big time. This was the oath that would be broken when Jon Arryn was killed and started the whole game of thrones that led to the fall of House Stark.

This would make the NK sympathetic to Jon. He was betrayed akin to how Jon was by the Nights Watch and also has suffered greatly for doing the right thing. Also, Westeros is full of oathbreakers even if they don't remember the oath, a Stark must always be in Winterfell...should have kept that one. Jon keeps his word **to a fault**...so if Westeros broke it and the NK is in the right...how would Jon react? 

*  **Winter is coming** \- the threat if anyone ever moves the Starks out \(which they did and so the NK moved south and winter came with him\)
*  **The North Remembers** \( pre\-dates the red wedding\) A warning, remember the pact. 

The problem is they did forget the pact and they ended up pushing the Starks from Winterfell and unleashing the NK wrath against the Oathbreakers, the people of Westeros. So the NK is very much like Ned, someone who made the ultimate sacrifice for Westeros but was betrayed. Now he is back from the dead \(and myth\) for revenge. I think is may also be why they removed Lady Stoneheart, it is redundant in a TV show while it is good foreshadowing in a book.

Does this mean he is coming to ""help"" the Starks? No, not at all. I think he lost his humanity and as evidenced with his run ins with Jon he doesn't have any love for the Starks, the oath was simply broken and winter is coming. If they get in his way I think he'd kill them all too. In addition to revenge on the people of Westeros and the COTF.

I think this also explains why he hated the COTF and the Three Eyed Raven \(he looked pissed when he found them in the cave\) because they suckered him in the deal and didn't really tell him they made the White Walkers in the first place. 

So now you go to help, make a deal with them, become cursed forever to stop this evil force only to find out it was **the ones who cursed you who made the threat to begin with.** That would motivate me to hate the COTF. Now I think he wants...

* Freedom \- He needs a suitable replacement, a child of ice and fire to take his place and lead the army of the north. It could be Jon. My bet is that he wants Dany's child. There are times he could have killed both of them but let them live. If he can see the future he would know he has several options now if they have a child together. 
* Revenge on Westeros for breaking their oath and removing the Starks and the COTF/Three Eyed Raven for their deception.

* The Song of Ice and Fire is the child of Jon and Dany that after all these years will produce an heir the NK can bestow his powers on. I think he wants their baby to take his place but it may be Jon that takes the burden in the end. I think this is the song though, the merging of both bloodlines that can take the NK curse and lead the army of the dead away. 

I think Jon will come to learn the NK isn't the mindless evil he thought he was, was once a man like Jon who tried to save everyone around him and was betrayed in the process just as he was and left for dead...as is common in GoT. Will it end with Jon relieving the NK of his watch or the NK taking their child \(obviously over their dead bodies\) I don't know. I don't expect a fun sword fight ending with Jon Snow beheading the NK and destroying the army of the dead. I think the price to defeat them will be great and the secrets of the past will reveal Westeros to be at fault for causing all of this. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
45,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-5-2,2018,5,2,2,8ga8fn,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS]A very long Night King origin theory...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ga8fn/spoilersa_very_long_night_king_origin_theory/,fearsundown,1525195765,"Sorry for the length, it is comprised of an amalgam of a lot of theories...if you are bored...proceed...

When the NK origin and motivations are revealed it will be built on stories that were already told. The reveal of the NK will inform events we have already seen/read rather than add an entirely new mythos to GoT. This is a carefully crafted story based on incredibly detailed source material from GrrM. D&amp;B would have known the NK origin from the start as GrrM did and would have woven it into the story since he is such a primary threat. Knowing this and having faith in all of them I think they have.

* Disclaimer:

D&amp;B used the source material so some answers might be in the books, some on the screen. I think D&amp;B might have streamlined the concept of the NK and combined/modified legends \(Last Hero and Azor Ahai\) or characters \(Lady Stoneheart and Coldhands\) etc but we will end up in roughly the same ending and motivations as GrrM books. So I think we can take from the books to a degree to unravel the mystery of the show. But I think things like Coldhands \(GrrM insisted it isn't Jon's uncle in the books and I don't think it is\), 13th lord commander/Night's King, Lady Stoneheart along with the Last Hero were omitted/modified to make the story simpler for TV where books can be far more intricate.

This quote from GrrM most influences my analysis of the NK even in GoT more than anything else:

**""Its not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, theyre really ugly. These are some of the things that Tolkien did; he made them work fabulously, but in the hands of his imitators, they become total clichs. I mean the orc\-like creatures who always do dress in black and... theyre really ugly and theyve got facial deformities or something. You can tell that if somebodys ugly, he must be evil.""**

More specifically, the long-reaching repercussions of said actions. Like how Arya would've never gone to Braavos without Ned dying, or like how Ned was executed purely because news of Jaime being taken captive got to KL too late (which would've made him too valuable as a hostage for KJ Illyn Payne to spill Ice on his neck). Small details that add up to an unforseen whole. There was accountability, grit, and real danger. The man we all thought was going to fix the damage King Bobby did to the realm suddenly (and very ironically, I'll add) got his head put on a spike.
It was a fantasy series that had more in common with the War of the Roses than it did with LotR. Even when the dragons were born, they always seemed to have natural limitations that rendered them more a liability than an asset - while they were children, and (weirdly) adolescents, at least. 
Then the books stopped. Towards the end of Season 5 and right at the beginning of Season 6, Dan and David began to take a more, shall we say... creative approach to the source material. Story arcs that went nowhere, characters acting... well, out of character, and those all-important consequences faded to nothing as plot armour took their place. 
Game of Thrones, or the novels at least, has always been based on characters and so I'll be breaking this essay down similarly. It's poetic, like. 

##Jon

There's really not that much I can say here, besides his ridiculous plot armour (it's at that level now where he doesn't even need to wear plate or a helmet into battle with **archers**). There's no sense of danger because it's apparent that Dan and David are saving him for a plot significant death. I mean, this is a clever idea, under normal storytelling constraints. The story can't go on forever and they need someone to end it, right? Wrong. The problem with this is that Jon has been set up as the Chosen One - and he's even getting a Magical Sword (Lightbringer) and he's the Rightful Heir and he's gonna Ride a Dragon. Could you have any more fantasy tropes? Seriously. Let me know. 
When this series has been set out to subvert *hundreds* of fantasy tropes, it becomes deeply disappointing to see that they had simply been put off until the end. How long did Jon spend in that frozen lake?

##Tyrion

Tywin Lannister writ small. Tyrion's chief asset, he makes clear to us in Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things, is his wit. Sharper than Jaime's sword and more compelling than Cersei's tits, as he would have it. We see him using it to get himself and, on one occasion, the entire population of KL out of deep, deep trouble. When he escaped the Eyrie by having Bronn take Ser Vardis; when he burned Stannis' fleet on the Blackwater; when he demanded a trial by combat for Joffrey's murder. You get the picture yet? Tyrion is **smart**. The smartest person in the series by far, and this single fact is drummed in all the further by *Daario Naharis* - yea, remember him?  - and even by Tywin himself. The whole reason Tyrion goes to KL is because Tywin wants him to fix **Cersei's** mistakes. Because Cersei is a *bad ruler*. All these things that took **years** to develop in the series are completely smashed in Season 7. Because, wait for it, Cersei outwitted Tyrion. *Cersei Lannister*. It's one thing tui say she was smarter than that oaf Robert and his stooge Ned Stark, but this is **Tyrion**.
His plan to ferry the Dornish army, thwarted by Cersei. His plan to usurp Cersei's power by holding all the Westerosi gold, thwarted by Cersei and the fact that, big surprise you fool Tywin **told** us that the Rock's mines went dry years ago. His plan for a truce? Completely and utterly pointless. In around episode 4, it's established that Dany is pretty much the most formidable force in Westeros. She has two armies, three dragons, and plot armour thicker than oatmeal. She completely **obliterated** Jaime's forces at the Blackwater. So what does Cersei stand to gain from this truce? She has no forces to add to theirs, well, save Crow's Eye's Iron Fleet. And that's a stretch considering Ironborn can't fight for shit on land. His plan to get a wight. Ahhahahahahahha. **His plan to capture a wight and show it to Cersei in the hopes that she'll join their efforts in the North**.
At that point, the disbelief went higher and further than Gendry's supersonic raven.

##Daenerys

Okay so people have mentioned this before. Dany is possibly one of the best examples of character development in the whole series, and we *see* this happen in real time. She goes from being pathetic, powerless, and so unbelievably boring to being a naked-as-often-as-clothed-and-doesn't-give-a-damn dragon queen with **two** armies. And then all of her agency is demolished when she falls for Jon faster than Viserion fell into that lake. Immediately after telling Tyrion how 'little' Jon is, she rushes off to save him **from a threat she didn't even fully believe was real** and literally **gave** NK the means of getting across the Wall. Not to mention that her dragons flew from *Dragonstone* (I repeat, *Dragonstone*) to the Lands of Always Winter in like a day at most. 
But, however contrived, this scene gave us the one thing we'd been hoping for for **hours**. Some accountability!
Viserion dies. However, immediately after this, all the suspense they've built is thrown to caution when we see a motherfucking zombie dragon being dragged from that same lake Jon was presumably swimming around in with some oddly industrious-looking zombies with *giant chains*. 

I could go on and on, but I'll wager you most likely already know this, and feel the same. I will go on watching, as most of you will, out of a misguided sense of obligation. The most fervent hope that a once-great series will be revived.

Now I know a lot of people assume (rightly so) that he will die protecting Daenerys. Mainly because that's what we expect from someone who keeps telling her they would die for her. But I think it's come to the point it would almost be disappointing if he did. Like think about it, he goes all this way on a massive journey with her just to die protecting her at the very end? If so he might as well have died where Ser Barristan died in the show. I think because he's survived so much including greyscale he will not die protecting Daenerys. I don't see that being his sole purpose to have come so far. Anyone can die protecting her now and if it was going to be Jorah then why not do it earlier? Why drag him along this far into the story? 

WELL I recently rewatched seasons 6 and 7 and there are two distinct things that stuck out to me. The first is when Dany tells Jorah to go find a cure and then return to her. And this is the quote that got me.... ""When I take the seven kingdoms, I need you by my side."" 

Fast forward to season 7 and where exactly did she need him? Before he came back to her she was fine with the people she had. THEN when he DID come back to her she barely changed.. In fact they barely spoke to each other and she ignored him almost completely. At first I thought it was just another season 7 inconsistency (probably is) but then later in episode 5 Tyrion says the same thing! 

He passes him the slavers coin and says ""bring it back.... Our queen needs you."" 
I'm left wondering how? Why? Because literally she doesn't even look at Jorah once until briefly in the season final after that. 
So my theory is Jorah's purpose actually isn't tied with Daenerys at all. In the books his father tells Sam to make Jorah join the Nights Watch if he ever sees him. And honestly I think that he will. I think Jorah next season will somehow get pulled into a situation with Beric, Tormund, Ed and the rest Nights Watch at Castle Black. He may not officially take the vow but i do see him perhaps taking some leadership over them. I think Jorah's larger purpose is redeeming himself to the North after he states he  broke his fathers heart and may follow in his footsteps a bit. 

There was leaked behind the scenes of three people riding horses with flaming swords toward the army of the dead. My bet it is the Nights Watch and probably Beric and perhaps Jorah too. 

It would also parallel the song in the books; ""When the Night Watch rode forth to meet the Others in the battle for the Dawn...."" - The Night that Ended. 

Considering Jorah said to Sam he owes him his life and Daenerys too AND he needs to redeem his family legacy, I believe Jorah will make an ultimate sacrifice. He will not save Daenerys but he will save probably a multitude. My prediction he sacrifices himself so Jon can get a final blow on the Night King or Jorah will outright kill the Night King but dying too. 

Basically I'm 100% certain he'll die but I'm pretty confident he'll do more than just ""save"" Daenerys... AGAIN. 

Thoughts? Don't need to agree with my prediction but I would like to hear other people's predictions and thoughts!

While the Hound and Baric are talking, Baric mentions they met at a tourney but before he said which one, the Hound cuts him off. Im assuming this is the Tourney at Harrenhal, where the big scene with Raegar and Lyanna and the blue rose happened. 


It got me wondering, how many characters are still alive at this point that witnessed this scene unfold? That led me to another thought - how will Dany, whos spent this entire series aiming to become basically the next Aegon the Conqueror, react when she finds out that Jon Starkgaryen is the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne? 


My personal theory is that she wont accept it, having spent all this time becoming a leader, then a Queen, then a Conqueror, only to have it taken away by some words written in a book about Raegars alleged annulment.  


But if you have a ton of the main characters, from all over Westeros, all around her that tell her its easily believable because they were all witnesses to what happened at Harrenhal and that it makes sense, I think thats going to be the biggest point in her character arc.  Will she secede to Jon being the rightful ruler? Or will she go full Mad King, like her father, and turn on them because she truly believes it is her right to rule Westeros?",10,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

As you may already know, at the San Diego Comic-Con, some of the main actors and actresses meet on the panel and hold an autograph session. That's why my plans are to travel in 2019 to San Diego. But I have doubts about this. Not knowing the exact launch date of season 8, I do not know if the panel will be held in 2019. Given that the date of the Comic-Con is in July, and assuming that season 8 is released before July, for example in April, will the panel be held in 2019? Or is it necessary that it be after July of the same year? And, in the event that it opens before July 2019, will it have the Comic-Con GoT panel in 2018? If the premiere is after the Comic-Con 2019, will there be a panel in the Comic-Con 2018? Those are the questions and I would be very grateful if someone solves my doubts.

Jaime is widely regarded as having no honor because of the Kingslaying incident (to the public even though we know the truth) but when he is fighting Ned in the streets of KL, he refuses to kill Ned after one of the Lannister soldiers wounds Ned from behind telling Tywin ""it wouldn't have been clean"". Later in s6 we find out that the only reason Ned, a man widely regarded as honorable, beat Ser Arthur Dayne (one of, if not the best fighter in history) only after he was wounded from behind first, and he without hesitation finished him off. Just crazy to think about how these two are perceived by the public but behind the scenes it's a bit of a role reversal in this scenario. ",35,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think she might be the princess that was promised OR her child is. (he/she)

What if the war is won by Cersei handing over her newborn child to the Night king? The ultimate sacrifice by her / the ultimate redemption.
A bargain struck with the transfer of her child. - That would be pretty bitter sweet.

John and Danny are also involved in this baby fiasco somehow. But one thing is for certain in my mind, the next child that pops out is extremely important.

It could also happen in reverse: John and Danny have a child and a bargain is struck with it.

But either way, I'm certain Cersei is the hero. (I know there was a leak about a certain scene) but my speculation is assuming that is false, or even deliberately placed to mislead.",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ned read the book of family trees  
and cried out, What the 'eck!  
Wee Joffrey's not bold Robert's son;  
his hair is blonde, not black.  
  
The mystery of Jon Arryn's death  
had now become quite clear.  
They'd killed to stop the shit hit fan,  
or so it would appear.  
  
Jon died from toxic poison, see  
he drank the Tears of Lys.  
Topped off for asking far too much.  
Knowledge shared by Varys.  
  
Ned's threat to tell King Rob the news  
put Cersei in a flap,  
but undeterred, she hatched a plot  
to cause a wee mishap.   
  
King Robert died while hunting boars.  
A case of pure bad luck?  
No way bad fortune was it that  
the queen's assassin struck.  
  
Now made Lord-Regent, Ned desired  
to have Rob's will read out.  
But Cersei would have none of that  
and mocked, We're reading nowt.  
  
A comic scene transpired right then  
with both sides set for strife.  
Seize him! Seize them! The cries went up,  
while Baelish brandished knife.  
  
Ned's men got slaughtered there and then,  
and he was fingered, thrust  
in jail, to hear a little voice,  
I'm one you cannot trust.  
  
Instead of Stannis on the throne,  
the whelp was crowned as king.  
'twas Joffrey's turn to rule the roost,  
but under mother's wing.  
  
Poor Ned was tricked to 'fessing up  
to save his daughters' skin.  
Instead of heading to the Wall,  
Ned's bonce dropped in the bin.  
  
Ned lost his head and Sansa Stark  
was captive of the king,  
but Arya fled with Forel's help.  
That fencer's sword could sing.  
  
In caravan bound for the Wall,  
king's bastard showed her how,  
disguised, she'd be all right a while,  
cried, God, she's 'Arry now!  
  
Robb Stark, the heir, marched south and reached  
the Twins and had to queue.  
The cranky pappy, Walder Frey,  
refused to let 'em through.  
  
That was until a bargain struck,  
for marriage and for aid,  
meant, rashly, Robb had pledged his troth   
to comely, virgin maid.  
  
In Riverrun, with battle won,  
and Jaime caught and bowled,  
retreat became the only choice  
for Tywin and his horde.  
  
The captured Jamie challenged Robb,  
but Stark declined to try.  
He then confessed to pushing Bran,  
but failed to tell Cate why.  
  
The Tullys and the Starks were cheered  
by son's prowess at war,  
while Robb, proclaimed King in the North,  
knew what he'd just fought for.   
  
The Imp was sent to Joffrey's court,  
to reign in his excess.  
The old king's siblings both staked claims  
and vied for some success.
  
Young Robb elected not to side  
with either man for king.  
Instead, he waited for to see  
what series two might bring.

In 306 AC, the War of the Five Kings had been raging for eight years by that point. Stannis Baratheon and his forces were in the North, having collected the remnants of Robb Starks shattered Northern Army after the Red Wedding. In the South, loyalist forces, a combination of the Lannister and Tyrell armies, along with naval forces under Euron Greyjoy, were attempting to stamp out any remaining pockets of resistance, while gearing up for an invasion of the North. However, to the surprise of both sides, the Night King and his White Walkers launched an invasion of Westeros. Setting aside their differences and power struggles momentarily to defend against the true threat, a massive force of soldiers from every corner of Westeros poured to the North to push back the Army of the Dead.

However, Cersei Lannister, ever the opportunist, believed this was her chance to end the war quickly and easily. Thousands of Lannister and Tyrell troops, secretly held back from the fight against the White Walkers, captured Storms End. Cersei believed the war was over. Stannis capital was hers, and the united army could do nothing to stop her after having their numbers decimated during the War of Dawn. This was the point the tide of the war changed. Though, not in the favor of House Lannister. Sensing the time for action was now, Doran Martell and Harrold Hardyng, now of House Arryn, joined the war on the side of Stannis Baratheon and the North, now under the leadership of Jon Snow, legitimized as a Stark. Cerseis allies abandoned her, unwilling to oppose such an overwhelming force. Kings Landing and Casterly Rock were captured, the Lion defeated, and King Stannis sat upon the Iron Throne.

My two favorites are the Stark theme and Jon/Dany theme. The former (e.g. [Goodbye Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYIQDpwEt-k) from the S1 soundtrack) I think amazingly captures the heartbreak of just about everything that happens to the Stark family. It's got that really dry, airy cello sound that IMO lends itself really well to fantasy settings. 

The theme for Jon and Daenerys (e.g. [Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Psg5mV4c) from the S7 soundtrack) on the other hand gives me this sense of wonder and excitement that I think perfectly represents the dynamic between the two. Also god damn that melody just hits me in the feels every single time. Truth is probably my favorite song from any season soundtrack.

What is the worst you think she can do? I personally dont want her on the Iron Throne, but how bad do you think it would actually be?

Do you think Cersei will fill a Mad Queen prophecy? What do you think shell do with all of this power?

Cersei is smart. I dont think she would be as vicious and cruel as the Mad King, unless you are truly one of her enemies. Which, as of now, she seems to have defeated almost all of them with the exception of Sansa Stark and Daenerys Targaryen. 

Side note: Maybe Cersei no longer wants Sansa dead, knowing Sansa is innocent of Jofferys murder?

If the North bent the knee to Cersei, do you think she would let them live in peace? 

So, in short, do you think its possible for peace under Cersei Lannister, or will the realm bleed? ",34,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

First outline season 8, episode 6

HBO LEAK

NOTE: FOR THOSE WHO WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED WITH DAVOS SEAWORTH IN EP.5

- He doesnt have a big role in this episode. He does appear and fight alongside Jon, Jaime, Gendry and co. He doesnt have lines in this episode but you see him fighting in this episode.

FINAL EPISODE: NOTE THAT MANY THINGS CAN STILL CHANGE AND THIS OUTLINE IS PRELIMINARY.

DURATION: +/- 110 minutes

 The first scene takes place in Dragonstone. Jaime, Bronn, Gendry, Tyrion and ser Davos arrive back in Dragonstone. Edmure supposedly has gone back to Riverrun. Jon receives them and informs them about Daeneryss death. Tyrion is very saddened when he hears that Daenerys has died and has a chat with Jon Snow on the cliffs of Dragonstone. He tells Jon that he believed in Daenerys. He believed that she could make a better place out of this shit world and that he could better give up on that dream. Further, Tyrion asks what killed Daenerys. Jon mentions that she died in childbirth and the Golden Company took her body to hand it over to Cersei Lannister. He asks what happened with the baby, on which Jon replies that their baby girl is alive and well. Tyrion smiles and then notices a single Greyjoy ship landing in Dragonstone. Jon and Tyrion walk toward the ship. Its no one but Yara Greyjoy who has arrived in Dragonstone. She informs them that she escaped Euron but lost almost all of her army. Jon asks her about Theons whereabouts and she tells him he probably didnt make it out alive when the dead arrived.

 Next shot is Daeneryss body hanging from the walls in Kings Landing. The people of Kings Landing are throwing shit at her body and make fun of her corpse. Nearby is an alehouse where Arya and the Hound currently are. They hear that Euron is king now and that Kings Landing will probably face another attack by Eurons enemies.

Arya wants to help Jon, fight with him, but the Hound thinks hes done with that shit for now. Arya says she doesnt care what the Hound does, but shell stay to fight alongside her brother. The Hound eventually agree to stay with her and help Jon and co.

 We then see Euron Greyjoy speaking with the Commanders of the Golden Company in the Throne Room. He thanks them for bringing the body of the Dragon Queen to him and thinks its a shame that they didnt bring her alive. He admits that he would have fucked her if they brought her alive. Euron Greyjoy expects that a reckoning is coming from the King in the North and that they should strike first. Euron commands the new Maester to send a raven to every kingdom and write that all of the Great Lords should swear fealty to him otherwise he shall attack them with his army of sellswords from Kings Landing.

 Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah, Sansa, Gendry, Davos, Missandei, Samwell and Yara are present at the War Council discussing the message of Euron Greyjoy. Euron Greyjoy has declared himself King of the Seven Kingdoms after Queen Cerseis tragic death. Jaime is convinced that Euron is behind the murder of Queen Cersei and is furious. Yara agrees with Jaime. Davos states his opinion that this madman shouldnt be ruling the Seven Kingdoms and they should fight back with everything they got. Gendry expresses his hatred toward Euron as he has taken the Baratheon seat away from his deceased family. Tyrion and Jaime want to use the Lannister army to fight Euron. Tyrion also think they should convince Daeneryss remaning loyal men to keep fighting for Jon and for Danys offspring. So we have the North, the Lannister army and the remaining Dothraki, Unsullied and Drogon fighting for them.

Its Samwell who later addresses Jons parentage again, but Jon doesnt want Samwell to tell the rest about this. Jon clearly states that he never wants to become a king. Its Davos who vouches for him. He tells the others that Jon is their last chance to save the people of Westeros from Euron Greyjoy dirty hands and he believes that Jon would make a good king. Hes their only hope. The others agree with Davos and Jon accepts his newly acquired position eventually.

 After the War Council, Jon talks with his sister, Sansa. Sansa is confused with Jons parentage and finds it difficult to believe that father always lied to his family, to Catelyn, to Jon. Jon agrees with Sansa and asks her to take care of the North and of Winterfell, as shes the heir of Winterfell. She agrees and tells Jon she was planning to leave Dragonstone anyway. The two share a hug before parting ways. Missandei informs Jon that the the old woman came to visit him in Dragonstone again. Old Melisandre comes to tell Jon shes ready to pay for her sins and reveals her identity. She tells a shocked audience that shes done her part and that the prophecy has come true. Davos vouches to have the witch killed at last. Gendry agrees with Davos. Missandei also points out that she tried to convince Daenerys to have her baby sacrificed to the Lord of Light. Jon proposes to hang Old Melisandre but Melisandre asks Jon to have her killed by fire, because thats the purest form of death. Shes executed outside of Dragonstone, killed by Drogons fire.

 Ships are starting to leave Dragonstone to sail for Blackwater Bay. Tyrion, Missandei, Davos, Samwell and baby Lyanna stay in Dragonstone for the time being. Jorah, Gendry, Jaime and Bronn are seen boarding on the ships. Jon asks Tyrion and Missandei to take care for Lyanna if he doesnt return alive. Jon also says goodbye to Samwell and thanks him for always being loyal to him.

 Euron is seen on the walls of Kings Landing and sees how Targaryen ships are approaching. Daeneryss rotting body can be seen as well. We notice Jon Snow, wearing Targaryen/Stark armour and mounting Drogon above the ships. Euron brings forward the scorpions that were redesigned on his orders. Lannister men first land ashore and start to invade. We see men of the Golden Company guarding the city walls. Two Commanders of the GC are riding elephants. The elephants tread on several Lannister men. We can see the Northern army joining the Lannisters and the Dothraki coming from the sides. Jon and Drogon join the fight and Drogon sets one of the commanders together with the elephant on fire. The poor animal stresses out and kills quite some men unknowingly when it dies. We see Yara giving the best of herself with her axe and Gendry smashing a mans skull with his hammer. Euron commands his men to take down Drogon with the scorpions. He has three of them. First they seem to fail to do so but then Drogon got hit two times in his right wing, prompting him to land. The Lannister army, Stark army and Dothraki fight ferociously and manage to break through the city gates. Jon tries to flee with Drogon to the Dragonpit, because he sees that Drogon is hurting and cant fly properly anymore. Arya notices that Drogons flying toward the Dragonpit. Meanwhile, The Hound has joined Jaime, Bronn and Jorah. Gendry and Yara decide to fight their way to the Red Keep where they think Euron is hiding himself right now. Euron actually commands his men to go to the Dragonpit to destroy the beast together with Jon Snow. Bronn and Jaime see Euron together with the Golden Company moving to the Dragonpit and go with them. Jaime starts to realize that Jon is in danger. Hes the only one besides Tyrion who knows that theres wildfire left beneath the Dragonpit.

If Drogon start to breathe fire right there, the wildfire could destroy the whole Dragonpit and taking everyone and everything with it.

 Arya and Nymeria now enter the Dragonpit to see Jon caring for Drogons injuries. Jon tries to remove the spears out of Drogons wings. Jon is very surprised to see Arya there and wants her to leave Kings Landing immediately. Arya doesnt want to leave Jon at first, indicating that she wants to fight with them. Arya strokes Drogon, commenting that she always dreamed of riding a dragon when she was younger, looking up to the tales of the Targaryen warriors. Jon smiles but strongly implores Arya to leave the Dragonpit now, because theyre in grave danger. They both share a hug before Arya decides to listen to Jon and leave. Shes clearly upset to leave Jon.

 Yara and Gendry are inside the Red Keep but come to the conclusion that Euron has escaped to the Dragonpit, much to Yaras annoyment because she wanted to finish her uncle.

 Euron and the GC invade the Dragonpit. Euron start to battle Jon Snow. Jaime hastens to the Dragonpit, together with the Hound and Jorah and some Lannister men to get Jon out of there. Bronn doesnt want to risk his life and stays where he is. Euron almost manages to kill of Jon Snow, but its Jaime who suddenly stabs him from behind, mortally wounding him. Jaime tries to get Jon out of the Dragonpit while Jorah and The Hound fight the remaining sellswords to make sure Jon gets out of the Dragonpit. Men of the Golden Company keep throwing spears at Drogon and its obvious that hes dying. At one point, Drogon unknowingly unleashes his fire, causing the Dragonpit to tremble. Jaime realizes that Drogon has caused the wildfire to ignite beneath the Dragonpit and commands Jon to run for his life. A gravely injured Euron laughs before hes dying, telling them that they are all fucked.

Before Jon, The Hound, Jaime and Jorah can escape it is too late and the wildfire consumes the whole Dragonpit. Nobody makes it out alive. Yara and Gendry witness the wildfire explosion from a distance and watch with much horror. People are seen fleeing Kings Landing before any more wildfire can ignite.

 The next scene takes place in Dragonstone. Tyrion sees a few Targaryen ships returning to Dragonstone. Yara and Theon inform Tyrion, Davos Samwell and Missandei about the wildfire explosion and that Jon, his brother and Jorah probably didnt make it out alive. Tyrion is broken when he hears the news and so are Samwell and Davos when they hear about Jons death. Samwell and Davos have some small talk and Samwell asks Davos what he will do now. Davos tells Sam hell probably returns to his wife since he has left her alone for far too long. Samwell smiles and tells Davos hes planning to do the same thing.

 We then see Arya and Nymeria ready to board on a ship, Arya tells the captain that shes done with Westeros. The captain asks what a small girl and a wolf are going to do in Essos now that theres peace in Westeros. Arya responds with Valar Morghulis. We see Aryas ship heading east, right before theres a time jump of 3 years.

 The next shot is Sam teaching Little Sam how to read. Lady Gilly Tarly, how shes named now, is Lady of the Reach. Sams mother, Talla and Gilly look to Samwell and Little Sam and both share they love for these two. Sam comes in between and ask where theyre talking about, but Sams mother jokes that it was only women talk. Sam and Gilly share a last scene together. Gilly has good news for Sam. Shes pregnant with his child. Sams clearly on cloud nine when he finds out that hes having his own child with Gilly. He also makes Gilly sure that hell always regard Little Sam as his own Sam and hell inherit the Reach one day.

 The next scene takes us to Winterfell, where we can see Lady Sansa and Lord Gendry now being together. Sansa watches with Gendry, Edmure and Roslin how Edmures sons are sparring with each other. Edmure still holds the title of Lord of Riverrun. Sansa notices that one of Edmures sons carries Aryas sword, Needle and asks how he retrieved it. Edmure answers that his son, Willem, has found the sword in the woods when they were hunting. He asks whether her sister is still alive, at which Sansa responds that she probably would be. Arya always has found a way to survive somehow. Sansa and Gendry visit the crypts of Winterfell. Jons statue stands in the crypts as well. Gendry asks Sansa if the truly belongs down there. Sansa says that it is the only place where Jon truly belonged, next to his real father Ned and with his brothers. Gendry jokes that he wasnt named Jon actually. Sansa says that he will always remain Jon Snow to her. Sansa mentions that she has a lot of work still to do, as shes Lady of Winterfell and Lady of the Vale by now. She asks what Gendry will do with Storms End, now that its left unoccupied. Gendry says hes planning to do soon after that hes been ackowledged as a true Baratheon by the King Regent.

 And then we get to see the King Regent and Hand of Queen Lyanna Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion is watching how Missandei is reading a book for Lyanna about the tales of Rhaenys and Visenya Targaryen, before she goes to sleep. Lyanna asks if her mother also rode a dragon and Missandei answers that she was quite a warrior. The next scene, Tyrion and Missandei are seen in bed with each other and talk about Lyanna, that shes not the most easy-going child. Tyrion mentions that shes quite good at brooding as well.

Missandei laughs and tells Tyrion that he shouldnt have expected otherwise with Jon and Daenerys as parents. Tyrion tells Missandei that shes doing an excellent job in educating Lyanna and the two start to have sex with each other. The last scene with Tyrion is one with Lyanna on the giant map of Westeros. Tyrion tells Lyanna she will rule the Seven Kingdoms one day. He explains that the North and the Vale are currently ruled by Lady Sansa Stark, the only remaining Stark child and that shes married to Lord Gendry Baratheon, Lord of the Stormlands. The Riverlands are ruled by Edmure Tully. Tyrion himself is in charge of Casterly Rock at the moment, but the castle is left unoccupied still. The Reach is ruled by Lord Samwell Tarly, son of Randyll Tarly. The Iron Islands on the other hands are currently ruled by Yara Greyjoy. Lyanna asks about Dorne, on which Tyrion answers that Dorne is now ruled by one of Oberyns daughters. She has been married to a man who has always dreamt of owning a castle and having a fine young lady. Now he has both of them. Now Tyrion and Lyanna walk toward the Iron Throne. Tyrion warns Lyanna that the Game of Thrones isnt a childs play and its one that comes at a price. Of course, Tyrion assures her that shell never have to deal with the Game of Thrones alone and hell always be there for her. Last shot is Lyanna and Tyrion staring at the Iron Throne.

 We end with a scene in the far far North, in the Lands of Always Winter. A single White Walker rides to and brings the body of Bran Stark to an altar. Remember that the Night King stabbed Bran in episode 2. He was stabbed in the heart with Dragonglass. He performs a certain ritual and Bran opens his eyes. Theyre bright blue. The White Walker puts a crown on Brans head and the altar slowly changes into one of ice. Winter is coming

First outline season 8, episode 2

HBO LEAK

 The episode will have a duration of almost 2 hours.

 The first scene will take place in the Great Hall of Winterfell. Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Davos and Sansa are present here. Gendry and Tormund tell the rest that the Wall has fallen and the Night Watch destroyed. Tormund also mentions that the Night King rides an undead dragon and that they are severely fucked. Bran Stark confirms Gendry and Tormunds story and tells that the Night King is on his way to Winterfell. Jon Snow tells the rest that they have no time to lose and asks Maester Wolkan to inform all of their banners, everyone in the North, to prepare themselves for a war against the Army of the Dead. They need to prepare for an attack at the battlefield of Winterfell.

 After having to process a lot of new information and struggling with his identity, Jon Snow goes to the crypts to visit his mother, Lyanna and his uncle, Ned Stark. Daenerys notices that theres something wrong with Jon and finds him in the crypts. She asks Jon whats wrong with him. Jon tells her that he even isnt called Jon Snow. He calls Jon Snow a lie people have made him believe all of life. Daenerys is confused and asks Jon for clarification but Jon walks away from her. Daenerys notices that Jon behaves aloof toward her.

 Daenerys walks out of the crypts, which Jorah Mormont notices. He asks her what happened down them in the crypts but Daenerys answers that she doesnt know whats up with Jon. She tells Jorah that Jon is hiding something from her. Jorah also tells Daenerys that it striked him that Daenerys has been so absent for days. She answers that shes not feeling very well lately. Jorah proposes to have her examined by Maester Wolkan.

 Qyburn enters Cerseis chambers. He mentions that she hasnt spoken about her miscarriage anymore and that she needs to take enough time to rest. Cersei answers that theres no time for that and doesnt want to say more about the miscarriage. Qyburn leaves her chambers, Cersei watches from her window, witnessing how the snow falls in Kings Landing. The next shot is Jaime, riding his horse in snowy conditions. He and Bronn arrive in Riverrun, both discover that the Tullys are once again laying siege to Riverrun. Jaime enters the stage and meets up with Edmure. Edmure tells Jaime he should have him in chains, but Jaime responds that he doesnt come to argue about the damned castle. He proposes Edmure to help his niece and nephew in the Great War against the Night King. He also promises to give Edmure Riverrun back to the Tullys, since it doesnt matter any longer whos holding the castle at this point. Edmure tends to agree, not for Jaime but for his family.

 Most of House Starks bannermen and Daeneryss army have now arrived in Winterfell. Among them is Howland Reed. He arrived with his army and Meera Reed by his side. Arya receives a visitor in Winterfell. He seems to be an ordinary bannerman from House Cerwyn, but he quickly removes his face. It seems to be Jaqen Hghar. Arya is surprised to have Jaqen visiting her. Jaqen tells Arya the Many-Faced God requires another death, a name to be crossed off her list. He reveals it to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister. A price was paid. What better servant of the Many-Faced God than Arya Stark can kill Cersei Lannister. He gives a vial of poison to Arya and leaves her.

 Jon Snow seizes the moment to talk with Howland Reed alone. He asks Howland to confirm Brans story, but Howland doesnt acknowledge this at all. Jon Snow pleads him to tell the truth since Robert Baratheon isnt alive any longer, theres no point in lying anymore. Howland ultimately confirms that Ned was carrying Lyannas child when he came out of the Tower of Joy. He always promised him to keep this a secret. Jon thanks him for telling the truth anyway.

 Knowing that the Army of the Undead will be upon them very soon, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Podrick, Davos, Tormund, Gendry, Varys, Jorah, Theon, The Hound, Grey Worm and Sam discuss together with the Stark bannermen and Daeneryss army how they will defend the North. Allegedly the Last Hearth has already been attacked by the White Walkers and their castle destroyed. Ned Umber didnt make it out alive. Tyrion speaks for Daenerys, whos absent due to illness. He comes forward with a plan to defend the North. Tormund, the remaining Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied will attack with dragonglass from the Dreadfort since thats where they are heading to first. On their way to Winterfell, the dragons will set the army of the Dead afire and House Starks bannermen and the Knights of the Vale will fight weakened forces at the battlefield of Winterfell and hopefully destroy the Night King as well. Jon wants Brienne and Podrick to take Sansa and Arya and Bran with them and to leave with Robin Arryn to the Eyrie.

Arya doesnt want to and claims that shes stronger than most men. They need her in the war to come. Jon insists that he doesnt want that. Jorah also wants to fight alongside House Mormont but Lyanna reminds him that he has betrayed his own House. Varys mentions that he has also received word from Kings Landing. Supposedly, Queen Cersei has bought a great army of sellswords and Euron Greyjoy has taken Storms End to install the army there. Theon pleads to have Storms End attacked and Gendry agrees since its the seat of his fathers house. Jon promises Theon that he will help to destroy Euron and save his sister after they have dealt with the Night King and his army. Theres no time for that now since all of their lives are in danger and they have no choice than to face the Night King and his army. He needs his help and that of the Iron Islanders as well during the battle at Winterfell. A disappointed Theon accepts his proposal.

 Missandei visits Daenerys in her chambers. Daenerys tells Missandei that Maester Wolkan examined her and that he confirmed that shes pregnant. Missandei asks why she isnt happy then. Daenerys feels that Jon has changed towards her and doesnt understand why.

 The Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied prepare to leave Winterfell. Jon asks Daenerys why she didnt attend this important gathering, but Daenerys doesnt reply to that as well. Meera goes to say goodbye to Bran in the Godswood in Winterfell when Bran starts to behave very strangely. He pleads Meera to warn them since the Night Kings army is here. Jon is going to say goodbye to Sansa when Meera runs to warn the others. A huge winter storm starts to come closer to Winterfell. Chaos erupts. The North and Daeneryss army gather outside to face the Night Kings army. Jon orders Sansa, Arya and Daenerys to stay inside Winterfell.

They are too valuable to lose and promises them that Winterfell will not fall. Varys, Tyrion, Robin, Samwell, Gilly, Lyanna and Missandei also remain inside Winterfell. Arya first doesnt want to but obeys Jons wish. Sansa asks Meera to get Bran inside asap. A huge flock of wights invade the battlefield of Winterfell. Dothraki face the Army of the Dead first and many of them are taken out quite easily. Lots of wights keep coming. Ghost fights with Jon and saves him at one point from a wight trying to kill him. Ghost is killed off trying to save Jon. Inside Winterfell, Daenerys is frustrated that shes not able to help and that she should fly Drogon to destroy the undead. Missandei answers that its not wise to join the fight while shes pregnant. Sam tries to console Gilly and Little Sam. The news surprises Sansa, Tyrion and Varys. Drogon comes in between and takes out a big chunk of the Night Kings army but also kills some of the Northern bannermen in the process. The White Walkers also enters the stage with the Night King flying Undead Viserion above them. Viserion starts to destroy the Northerns army as well. Lord Glover and Howland Reed die are killed by dragonfire. Tormund leads the Free Folk and fights but is killed by Drogons fire. Drogon also manages to kill an undead giant. Meera wants Bran to leave the Godswood but he tells her he has help and Jon and co. Bran is trying to control Rhaegal with his mind. Meera warns Bran that is too dangerous and that he should stay inside. Jon and Daeneryss army is diminishing greatly since many wights keep coming. White Walkers try to invade Winterfell. Grey Worm faces two White Walkers and is able to take out one of them with his spear from Dragonglass. The other WW kills him. The White Walkers supposedly try to invade Winterfell to take down Bran.

Brienne guards the castle together with Podrick, Jorah and Gendry. Wights and White Walkers and Wights start to invade there as well. Podrick is killed off by a group of Wights, which makes Brienne go psycho and takes out one of the White Walkers as well with Oathkeeper. Meera is urging Bran to give up and get inside but Bran doesnt want to. He wants Meera to leave instead and get safe inside the castle. Meera answers that she will stay together with him until the end. Jaime Lannister and the Tully forces come to the Norths aid right in time. Bran is managing to warg inside Rhaegal and the dragon starts to fight undead Viserion, trying to bite him right in the neck but gets gravely injured during the fight as well. Rhaegal starts to breathe fire on Viserion, which seems to make the Night King start leaving the battlefield on injured Viserions back.

 Meera realizes that this is the end for them. White Walkers are coming for Bran and she gets killed off by the White Walkers while defending Brans body. Viserion and Rhaegal keep fighting each other and both start to be seriously injured. It seems like dragonfire can harm the Night King. The White Walkers stab Bran to death, which makes Rhaegal fall to the ground and to be stabbed to death by Wights. The Night Kings army of Undead is starting to diminish. We see Jaime commanding his men and fighting the remaining Undead alongside Bronn. Jon fights alongside the Hound and Davos. The Hound is fighting like a boss right here. When Jon starts to notice that the Night Kings army is retreating as well he commands everybody to leave the battlefield asap and goes with Davos and the Hound to get everyone safely outside now. The Knights of the Vale, Sansa, Brienne and Robin leave together to the Eyrie. Arya, The Hound, Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Tully and Lannister forces retreat to Riverrun. Jon, Davos, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Samwell, Gilly, Little Sam, Theon, the remaining Unsullied and Dothraki forces travel south. Lyanna Mormont and her men retreat to Bear Island.

 The last shot we see is Jon and Daenerys on Drogons back setting all the dead afire including dead Rhaegal. Both sides suffered great losses in this fight.

First outline season 8, episode 3

HBO LEAK

 Note that this episode is a bit shorter than the others and has a duration of +/- 60 minutes.

 Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, Robin, Lord Royce, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Varys, Brienne, Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, Davos, Missandei, Little Sam and Theon all arrive in Greywater Watch. Not all of these characters appear on screen though. They make a stop to rest there and to discuss their strategy to defeat the Night King for good.

 Inside Greywater Watch, Daenerys, Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Davos, Robin and Lord Royce discuss how they will organize themselves before splitting up. Jon proposes to await the Night Kings attack from the Eyrie since the fortress is very difficult to impregnate. Tyrion jokes that the Night King only needs 10 good men to impregnate the bitch, but only Bronn catches the joke. The remaining Lannister and Tully army defend Riverrun together with Edmure, Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn. When the Eyrie gets attacked first, the Night Kings army has to get lured into the Bloody Gate and thats when the Lannister and Tully forces need to join the attack as well. Theon has to take back Pyke and defend it together with the remaining army of the North and the Ironborn. Jon remarks that Arya and The Hound have not been seen arriving in Greywater Watch. Edmures assures that Arya hasnt died but simply disappeared when they were retreating from Winterfell. Sansa remarks that shed be safe with the Hound. She always manages to survive somehow. Jon also wants Sansa and Brienne to join Robin and Gendry to the Eyrie where theyd probably be safer than now. Jon stays with Davos, Jaime, Jorah, Bronn, Tyrion and Edmure in Riverrun. Jon wants Daenerys, to travel to Dragonstone together with Varys and Missandei. Sam and Gilly should travel with her.

Maester Wolkan received bad news, though. Lyanna Mormont didnt make it to Bear Island and died.

 Next shot is Arya and the Hound travelling on the Kingsroad. The Hound complains to Arya that she should have followed her brother and sister and that shes a stupid girl to travel alone in the North now that the army of undead fuckers are around. Arya answers the Hound that he shouldnt have sticked with her if hes scared. The Hound deduces that Arya is traveling to Kings Landing, but he doesnt understand why. Arya says that she has to cross one last name off her list. The Hound laughs and tells Arya why shes still holding that fucking list since everyone will die soon anyway. Arya responds that she needs to kill Cersei herself. The Hound agrees and tells that he has some unfinished business with his brother as well. The two encounter by an old woman, whos asking after the King in The North. The Hound says that an old woman shouldnt be alone in the woods with the army of the Night King approaching. The old woman says she doesnt fear the dead. Arya tells the woman she thinks Jon Snow has traveled south, probably to Dragonstone. The old woman takes a look at Arya and tells her that they have met before. Arya is puzzled about this, the Old Woman leaves.

 During the night, the characters at Greywater Watch sleep in huts. Jon chats a last time with Howland Reed, asking if he joins them to the South since the White Walkers would probably hit Greywater Watch soon. Howland Reed tells that hes ready to die. He doesnt care of his life anymore, now with his children being passed away. He tells Jon Snow the Walkers can have him. He tells Jon he also needs to pay for his sins, for killing Arthur Dayne behind his back. He tells Jon the story of how he saw Ned Stark with baby Jon in his arms.

His uncle always wanted to keep him safe, even willing to sacrifice his life for Jon. Howland tells Jon he recognizes a lot of traits of Ned in Jon Snow and says that he would make a good ruler on the Iron Throne. Jon insists that he isnt interested in that and leaves Howland Reed.

 Then, we see Cersei in Kings Landing. Qyburn visits the chamber of the Hand and informs Cersei that Winterfell has been attacked and that Daenerys and Jon have lost a great deal of their army. Cersei smiles. Qyburn also tells that the Lannister army has joined the Battle at Winterfell apperently. Cersei asks if Jaime has survived, but Qyburn tells he doesnt know. Cersei answers that he shouldnt have. After that, Euron arrives back in Kings Landing. He comes to tell Cersei that the Golden Company succefully took Storms End and that the army is gathered right there. He tells Cersei he finally wants to receive his reward and they shouldnt wait to marry and be husband and wife tonight. Cersei reluctantly agrees.

 Its still night in Greywater Watch and the characters stay there until morning. Jon and Daenerys sleep together in a hut. Daenerys finally tells Jon that shes pregnant with his child. Jon is surprised and expresses his happiness toward Daenerys. He jokes that this is the only good thing that happened to them at the moment. He also wonders about their childs health since theyre family. Daenerys comforts Jon the Targaryens have been inbreeding for years and shes perfectly healthy. Daenerys thinks shes having a son again, and asks Jon what he would name their son. Jon thinks he should be named after the greatest person he knew in his life, the one that saved his life, his uncle Ned. He wants his son to be named Eddard Targaryen. Daenerys repeats the name and smiles.

She says she likes it very much. The two start to kiss in their hut. Jaime visits Briennes hut as well. Brienne grieves over Podricks death, telling him that Podrick was the least person to deserves to die like that. Jaime agrees telling Brienne that he was a good lad and he was lucky to have been around Brienne all that time.

 The Hound and Arya make a fire during the night. The Hound asks how she managed to cross off almost every name of her list, but before Arya can respond she tells the Hound to shut up. She hears some strange noises. Not much later, a group of wights attack Arya and the Hound. The two begin to fight the wights but more wights come since theyre attracted to the noise. Its then when Nymeria and a much larger pack of wolves come in between and kill off a big bunch of Wights. A lot of wolves die too. When most of the Wights are killed off, The Hound thinks they should flee as soon as they can before another group of Wights comes to kill them off. Arya discovers that she has lost Needle during the fight, but the Hound insists that theres no time left to search for the damned sword and that they should leave immediately. This time Arya manages to have Nymeria follow her and the Hound.

 The wedding between Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy takes place in the Throne Room. Euron looks very delighted, Cersei not so. Its Qyburn who has them married. Cersei wears a tight, long black dress. She looks quite sad during the wedding. The wedding scene itself doesnt take long and the scene switches to their wedding bed. This scene is an intercut between Cersei and Euron having sex and Jaime and Brienne also having sex in their hut. The two still think of each other.

 Next morning, the group departs from Greywater Watch and Jon and Sansa say goodbye to each other for the time being. Jon asks Gendry to keep his sister safe. Daenerys and Jon also say goodbye and leave each other. Daenerys tells Jon that Drogon should stay with him. Theyll need him to fight the Night King. The two kiss before leaving each other. Jorah is still having difficulties with that. We see all of the character go different ways and thats how the episode ends.

 Died: a lot of Wights and wolves, Lyanna Mormont (off-screen)

End Episode 3

First outline season 8, episode 4

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS MIGHT ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

EDIT: ORIGINALLY, HOWLAND DIED DURING EP.2 BUT THE WRITERS CHOSE TO INCLUDE GREYWATER WATCH LATER ON.

 The first scene will take place in Kings Landing. Cersei speaks with Qyburn, Euron and the three Commanders of the Golden Company. Qyburn informs them that Daenerys and Jon have been splitting up their army and that Jaime is currently with Jon and Edmure in Riverrun, probably awaiting an attack from the Night King. Pyke has been taken again by Theon Greyjoy and Jons army, which visibly angers Euron. Daenerys traveled back to Dragonstone. Cersei laughs and tells the rest she hopes the Night King devours their army soon enough. They shouldnt wait too long and have the Golden Company attack Dragonstone since Daeneryss army is reduced remarkably. Euron Greyjoy is watching the Iron Throne when Cersei joins him in the Throne Room. She asks Euron why he doesnt attack Pyke, since his nephew has taken it from him. Euron initially thinks its a stupid idea to go North now, but Cersei convinces him to learn them another lesson. Euron decides to take his fleet and travels to Pyke.

 Cersei and Qyburn are watching from above how Euron leaves. Qyburn asks Cersei if it is smart to have their most important ally travel so far North at the moment. Cersei tells Qyburn she hopes her enemies deal with Euron Greyjoy and that he never returns to Kings Landing.

 Daenerys, Sam, Gilly, Varys and Missandei have returned to Dragonstone. Varys reports to Daenerys that Cersei has hired the Golden Company and that Eurons ships has been seen leaving Kings Landing. They could attack her any moment, now that her forces are weakened. Daenerys agrees and hopes that Jon and co. finishes the Night Kings army as soon as possible. When Daenerys takes a bath, Missandei remarks that shes visibly pregnant right by now. Daenerys asks Missandei how she deals with Grey Worms death, at which Missandei responds that shes missing him every day. Missandei asks Daenerys whether she misses Jon. Daenerys says she does. Next scene is Samwell with Gilly and Little Sam. Samwell wants Gilly to travel to Horn Hill with Little Sam. They arent safe in Dragonstone with enemies from all sides. Gilly reminds Sam that he promised her not to leave them, but Sam insists that they must. Theyll be safe with his mother and sister. He promises that hell fight for them.

 Jaime, Jon, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah and Edmure are already in Riverrun. Jon mentions that the Army of the Dead has been seen reaching the Twins. They will be upon them soon and tells them they should take their armies to the Eyrie immediately. Tyrion takes the time to ask Jaime about Cersei and why he chosen to leave her. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei will never find peace after the deaths of their children and chose to betray everybody during the Dragonpit by hiring the Golden Company. Their relationship fully consumed him. Tyrion reminds the rest that Daenerys isnt safe in Dragonstone, now that Cersei has an army of thousands of sellswords behind her back. She could attack Dragonstone any moment from now. Jorah think his place should be with his queen now as he promised to protect her at any cost. Jon seems to agree and lets him go.

Jon sends word to his sister, Sansa, to inform her that the Army of the Dead will reach the Vale soon and that their army is marching to the Vale now.

 Cersei stands with the commanders of the Golden Company on the giant map of Westeros. She instructs the commanders to take their men to Dragonstone with Eurons remaining ships and to capture Daenerys Targaryen. She cant wait to kill the foreign whore herself. The commanders leave and obey her orders.

 Sansa receives word from Jon Snow and orders the Lords of the Vale that they should prepare now. She convinces Robin Arryn to have Lord Royce lead the Knights of the Vale. Robin tells Sansa he intends to fight with them. Sansa answers Robin that its not a good idea and that he should be kept safe. Robin laughs and tells Sansa that hes not a girl, unlike Sansa. Gendry and Sansa have a conversation as well. Sansa asks how Gendry came to meet Arya, but he tells Sansa that the story is too long to tell. The two seem to get well along and Sansa thanks him for fighting with them.

 Missandei receives a visitor in Dragonstone. She first asks after Jon Snow, but is happy to meet Daenerys as well. It seems to be old Melisandre who comes to bring them important news. Old Melisandre tells them that a great last sacrifice should be made if they want to win the war and that it requires true kings blood. Old Melisandre points at Daeneryss baby. Daenerys is furious at the old lady and sends her away immediately. Before Old Melisandre leaves, Varys talks with her outside. Melisandre makes her identity known, which has Varys shocked. She tells Varys that he should remember what the voice said in the flames. He should be the one to save the common people from the doom. She asks Varys to fulfill the prophecy and save Westeros. Varys cant utter a word. Melisandre leaves Dragonstone and the series.

 The next shot takes place in Pyke. Theon Greyjoy is sitting on his fathers chair when his men come to tell him that Euron Greyjoy has arrived in Pyke as well. Euron speaks with Theon outside. He has Yara with him and tells Theon that he should give up Pyke already or hell slit his sisters throat in front of him. Theon is starting to notice that its getting a lot colder and he can see his breath. He tells Euron that they are coming for them, but Euron doesnt understand at first. Men start to scream and Wights start invading Pyke. Yara takes adventage of the moment and kicks Euron. Theon implores Yara to escape to Dragonstone. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he wont fail her another time. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he wont fail her another time. She escapes on a small ship with a few loyal men. Theon fights Euron himself. Ironborn and Northmen fight the wights, while Euron battles Theon. Euron gets the upper-hand and swings his axe Theon right in Theons body. Theon dies immediately, Euron laughs. Euron implores his men to leave Pyke with the boats. A lot of his men have died, but Euron manages to escape.

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

NOTE: DURATION TIME (=/- 100 min.)

 First scene will only include the soundtrack of R. Djawadi, theres no dialogue in the first five minutes. We first see the Knights of the Vale preparing themselves for an attack. We get a shot of the Lannister, Tully and Stark army marching to the Vale. Jaime, Tyrion, Edmure and Bronn are seen leading their men. Then we see the Golden Company getting on board of Euron Greyjoys ships. The Knights of the Vale see a huge storm approaching slowly, Yohn Royce is commanding the Army of the Vale to keep their spears of dragonglass ready. Robin Arryn fights alongside Yohn Royce. Lord Royce isnt too pleased to have Robin Arryn commanding their men. You can literally read that from his face.

 First line comes from Yohn Royce who commands his men to keep ready. Wights start to invade the Bloody Gate. Robin Arryn is commanding the archers, but fails miserably. Inside the Eyrie, we see Lady Sansa together with Gendry and Brienne of Tarth. Gendry says goodbye to Sansa and joins the fight. Sansa tells Gendry she hopes hell come back. Gendry expresses his doubt. Brienne of Tarth also wants to join the fight, but Sansa isnt too fond of that idea. She wants Brienne to stay with her, but Brienne says she cant save Sansa if the Wights invade inside the Eyrie as well. She swore to protect Sansa and the best way to do that is to keep the entry of the Vale safe from the Night Kings army. Sansa hugs Brienne and thanks her for everything she has done to protect her family. Brienne leaves to join the fight.

 Next scene takes place in Dragonstone. News reaches Dragonstone that the Golden Company is on their way to attack Queen Daenerys. Daenerys commands her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki to protect Dragonstone from invading there. Varys advises her to leave Dragonstone immediately, but Daenerys doesnt listen to his counsel. She realizes that her water has broken and shes ready to labor. Missandei and Samwell help Daenerys and make her rest right away. Samwell is worried because Daeneryss baby is coming way to soon.

 Then we see three White Walkers from a distance watching how the Wights win from the Knights of the Vale. The Night King is flying on Viserion above the White Walkers, watching the spectacle as well. Viserion apparently has lost one of his eyes and his right wing got gravely injured. Brienne is fighting for her life. Robin Arryn is almost attacked by several Wights and runs away to hide inside of the Eyrie. Sansa confronts him that he promised to fight with his men, but Robin expresses his lack of interest in the survival of his men.

Brienne, Lord Royce and Gendry continue to fight but it looks like a losing side until now. The White Walkers now start to invade the Eyrie as well. A roaring Undead Dragon can be heard. A one blue-eyed Undead Viserion flies above Lord Royce and his men and sets them afire. Then we hear the roaring of another dragon. The Night King looks behind and sees Jon Snow on Drogon helping the Lord of Vale out. Beneath Jon Snow, we see the Tully, Lannister and Northern forces joining the fray. Lots of Wights are set afire by Drogon while the Westerosi armies slaughter them. It looks like the Dragonfire doesnt affect the White Walkers, though. Bronn manages to kill of a White Walker with two spears of Dragonglass. Jaime sees that Brienne is getting in trouble with another White Walker. She gets stabbed right in the guts and thats when Jaime goes mad and stabs the WW from behind. Brienne is dying and Jaime holds her in her arms. She asks Jaime to keep Sansa and Arya safe, as she promised that to Lady Catelyn. Jaime says he will do that for her. Brienne last words are that Jaime is a honorable man. She dies in his arms.

 Arya, the Hound and Nymeria are entering a snowy Kings Landing. The Hound remarks that he hasnt missed the stinking city at all and Arya agrees. Arya notices that the city has changed a lot since she has left and walks past a destroyed Sept of Baelor. To be in the same place again reminds her of Ned Stark. She tells the Hound its time to pay the Lannisters their debts.

 Daenerys is starting to labor. Its Samwell and Missandei who help her with it. Varys witnesses how a smaller part of the Golden Company is invading the shores of Dragonstone. The Unsullied try to stop them from entering the stairs to the castle. The Dothraki fight them on shore. Jorah and a small part of the Northern army join the fight as well. Jorah tries to get inside the castle to protect Daenerys.

 In the Eyrie, the army of the Undead is diminishing by the second. Edmure is leading his men very well; Tyrion does too. The Night King is no longer mounting Viserion and tries to get inside the Eyrie with another White Walker. Viserion tries to attack Gendry and opens his mouth to spit fire on him. Gendry mounts a spear of Dragonglass in the mouth of the dragon. Undead Viserion falls from the rocks of the bloody gate and it is Drogon who finishes the job and sets Viserion on fire.

 Jorah has made it into Dragonstone and finds Daenerys laboring. Things dont look too bright for her. A sad Samwell concludes that both mother and child could never survive together and he only can save one of them. Jorah wants Daenerys to survive but Daenerys doesnt want to give up on her baby. Samwell sets through and Daenerys manages to deliver her baby. Samwell tells Daenerys that she has delivered a girl and asks for her name. A very weakened Daenerys wants to name her baby Lyanna, as Jon would have liked that. Daenerys is dying and Missandei, Varys and Jorah realize that. The Golden Company is getting the upper-hand and start to invade the stairs to Dragonstone as well. Daenerys says goodbye to Jorah and thanks him for always being there for her. Jorah expresses his love for her and Daenerys asks Jorah to continue his oath and to keep her daughter safe for her together with Missandei. She asks Jorah to release her from her suffering and to kill her. Jorah says he never could and its Varys who puts Samwells sword, Heartsbane, through Daeneryss chest.

 Cersei Lannister and the Mountain receive Qyburn in the Throne Room. He comes to tell her that Daenerys has been defeated. Cersei laughes and both drink to celebrate their victory. Cersei begins to feel dizzy and the audience realizes that its Arya with Qyburns face. She has poisoned Cersei with Jaqens vial. Qyburn starts to confront her and Cersei realizes that something is not right here. Thats when Arya makes her identity known. She tells Cersei that a lion should never have fought with a pack of wolves. Cersei begs The Mountain to kill off Arya but Arya tells her that wont help. She brings in Nymeria and the Hound to finish the job. Nymeria gravely injures Cersei and the Hound combats with the Mountain. Its Arya who finishes Cersei and slits her throat. Nymeria and the Hound destroys the Mountain but he doesnt seem to die. The Mountain loses his helmet at some point and thats when the Hound manages to burn his face with fire. The Mountain is left to die and The Hound, Arya and Nymeria leave The Red Keep.

 The Commanders of the Golden Company have entered the castle and order Varys to hand over Daenerys to them. Varys tell them that Daenerys has died and the Commanders clear Varys out of their way and stab him. They indeed find Daeneryss body and take her body with them to bring it to Queen Cersei. Samwell is able to hide himself together with Missandei and Danys baby. The Golden Company retreat back to Kings Landing.

 Euron Greyjoy arrives back in Kings Landing to find out that Queen Cersei has been slaughtered. He pretends to be saddened by her death.

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark arrive back in Dragonstone to find out that everyone has been slaughtered. Samwell meets him on the stairs with Jons child in his arms. Jon starts to weep. He asks if Daenerys has made it, but Samwell is sad to tell him she has not. He tells him she named their daughter Lyanna Targaryen.

 The last scene of the episode is the coronation of King Euron I Greyjoy. He is made King of the Seven Kingdoms.

Deaths: Lord Royce, Brienne of Tarth, Robin Arryn, Undead Viserion, Queen Daenerys Targaryen, Night King, Qyburn (off-screen), Queen Cersei Lannister, The Mountain and Varys

But the whole thing was ruined for me by the scene where Meryn is revealed to be a pedophile. I feel like it insults the audience's intelligence. We know Trant is a bad guy and, more importantly, that Arya hates him. He killed Syrio, he's slapped Sansa around, he serves the Lannisters. But they had to pull some random, and to be honest disproportionately ""bad guy"" stuff out of nowhere to remind us how bad he is. He may as well have walked onto the screen, recited some pages out of Main Kampf, cackled ""HAHAHA I HATE THE JEWS"", and then walked off. It was transparently, and clumsily, a set up for him to be killed by Arya the next episode.

Even if they wanted him to be a pedophile, they could have presented it in a much more graceful manner. Script rewrite. Arya scouts Meryn's daily trips to a bar. Arya follows Meryn to bar. Drunk Meryn catcalls the 14 year old Arya, who he does not recognize (there you go, pedo). Arya picks up on it, shows some shoulder or something and walks into alleyway. Excited Meryn follows and gets stabbed repeatedly in the eyeball. That would have been fine, everyone in character, and it would have been better for Arya's character development because then she wouldn't be killing someone who was painted so comically evil, she would be killing someone who was just normal human evil, which to me is so much more satisfying. 

Does this make sense?",22,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Anyways now that Is out of the way let's begin:

- NK attacks and destroys castle black killing Edd and the NW

- Arya kills Varys via poisoning him (remember season 1 when Arya spotted him talking to Illyrio)

- Theon arrives to help everyone in the great war after saving his sister

- Jon rides Rhaegal

- NK sack WF, Sansa sacrifices herself saving Arya and Bran is turned into a WW

- almost everyone evacuates to the Eyrie, Euron returns with the Golden Company but Cersei gets betrayed and she with the Mountain escape to Storm's end. Euron kills Illyn Payne and Qyburn pretends to change sides as Euron declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms.

- Rhaegal and Ghost are killed, Jon on Drogon and NK on Viserion fight in the skies above the Trident, Both fall to the ground with there dragons dead. Jon is about to lose but Jaime comes in and stabs NK in the back and Jon is able to kill the NK.

- Arya is forced to kill Undead Bran with catspaw, Jon is TPTWP, Arya is the Last Hero Reborn, and Jaime is AAR.

- Dany dies in childbirth but Beric brings her back via the kiss of life, The final conflict is in the form of Cersei and Euron as NK and Undead Bran are defeated in Episode 4 or 5.

- Jaime is killed trying to kill Cersei by either Cersei poisoning him or the Mountain splitting him in half. Arya kills Cersei and we get Cleganebowl with the Hound winning.

- Euron and Jon and Theon fight in the Red Keep but the wildfire goes off resulting in the deaths of Jon, Theon, Euron, Damphair, Jorah, Pod, Sept Unella, and Davos.

- Dany melts down the throne and declares the new king will be elected as she no longer wants to rule, but in irony Dany will be elected Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Yara will be queen of Pyke, Robin still rules the Vale, A New house rules Riverlands as Edmure died in the Great war, Arya rules the North taking Gendry as her husband (with Gendry accepting the Stark name), Bronn will rule The Reach getting his castle in the form of Highgarden, New house ruling Stormlands, and Tyrion rules the Westerlands opening a Vineyard with the Hound.

- Brienne gives birth to Jaime's child and raises it in the North as she is Arya's bodyguard, and Dany cares for her child on her own.

- Qyburn has escaped to Essos and is never heard from again, he is presumed dead.",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

First outline season 8, episode 2

HBO LEAK

 The episode will have a duration of almost 2 hours.

 The first scene will take place in the Great Hall of Winterfell. Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Davos and Sansa are present here. Gendry and Tormund tell the rest that the Wall has fallen and the Night Watch destroyed. Tormund also mentions that the Night King rides an undead dragon and that they are severely fucked. Bran Stark confirms Gendry and Tormunds story and tells that the Night King is on his way to Winterfell. Jon Snow tells the rest that they have no time to lose and asks Maester Wolkan to inform all of their banners, everyone in the North, to prepare themselves for a war against the Army of the Dead. They need to prepare for an attack at the battlefield of Winterfell.

 After having to process a lot of new information and struggling with his identity, Jon Snow goes to the crypts to visit his mother, Lyanna and his uncle, Ned Stark. Daenerys notices that theres something wrong with Jon and finds him in the crypts. She asks Jon whats wrong with him. Jon tells her that he even isnt called Jon Snow. He calls Jon Snow a lie people have made him believe all of life. Daenerys is confused and asks Jon for clarification but Jon walks away from her. Daenerys notices that Jon behaves aloof toward her.

 Daenerys walks out of the crypts, which Jorah Mormont notices. He asks her what happened down them in the crypts but Daenerys answers that she doesnt know whats up with Jon. She tells Jorah that Jon is hiding something from her. Jorah also tells Daenerys that it striked him that Daenerys has been so absent for days. She answers that shes not feeling very well lately. Jorah proposes to have her examined by Maester Wolkan.

 Qyburn enters Cerseis chambers. He mentions that she hasnt spoken about her miscarriage anymore and that she needs to take enough time to rest. Cersei answers that theres no time for that and doesnt want to say more about the miscarriage. Qyburn leaves her chambers, Cersei watches from her window, witnessing how the snow falls in Kings Landing. The next shot is Jaime, riding his horse in snowy conditions. He and Bronn arrive in Riverrun, both discover that the Tullys are once again laying siege to Riverrun. Jaime enters the stage and meets up with Edmure. Edmure tells Jaime he should have him in chains, but Jaime responds that he doesnt come to argue about the damned castle. He proposes Edmure to help his niece and nephew in the Great War against the Night King. He also promises to give Edmure Riverrun back to the Tullys, since it doesnt matter any longer whos holding the castle at this point. Edmure tends to agree, not for Jaime but for his family.

 Most of House Starks bannermen and Daeneryss army have now arrived in Winterfell. Among them is Howland Reed. He arrived with his army and Meera Reed by his side. Arya receives a visitor in Winterfell. He seems to be an ordinary bannerman from House Cerwyn, but he quickly removes his face. It seems to be Jaqen Hghar. Arya is surprised to have Jaqen visiting her. Jaqen tells Arya the Many-Faced God requires another death, a name to be crossed off her list. He reveals it to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister. A price was paid. What better servant of the Many-Faced God than Arya Stark can kill Cersei Lannister. He gives a vial of poison to Arya and leaves her.

 Jon Snow seizes the moment to talk with Howland Reed alone. He asks Howland to confirm Brans story, but Howland doesnt acknowledge this at all. Jon Snow pleads him to tell the truth since Robert Baratheon isnt alive any longer, theres no point in lying anymore. Howland ultimately confirms that Ned was carrying Lyannas child when he came out of the Tower of Joy. He always promised him to keep this a secret. Jon thanks him for telling the truth anyway.

 Knowing that the Army of the Undead will be upon them very soon, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Podrick, Davos, Tormund, Gendry, Varys, Jorah, Theon, The Hound, Grey Worm and Sam discuss together with the Stark bannermen and Daeneryss army how they will defend the North. Allegedly the Last Hearth has already been attacked by the White Walkers and their castle destroyed. Ned Umber didnt make it out alive. Tyrion speaks for Daenerys, whos absent due to illness. He comes forward with a plan to defend the North. Tormund, the remaining Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied will attack with dragonglass from the Dreadfort since thats where they are heading to first. On their way to Winterfell, the dragons will set the army of the Dead afire and House Starks bannermen and the Knights of the Vale will fight weakened forces at the battlefield of Winterfell and hopefully destroy the Night King as well. Jon wants Brienne and Podrick to take Sansa and Arya and Bran with them and to leave with Robin Arryn to the Eyrie.

Arya doesnt want to and claims that shes stronger than most men. They need her in the war to come. Jon insists that he doesnt want that. Jorah also wants to fight alongside House Mormont but Lyanna reminds him that he has betrayed his own House. Varys mentions that he has also received word from Kings Landing. Supposedly, Queen Cersei has bought a great army of sellswords and Euron Greyjoy has taken Storms End to install the army there. Theon pleads to have Storms End attacked and Gendry agrees since its the seat of his fathers house. Jon promises Theon that he will help to destroy Euron and save his sister after they have dealt with the Night King and his army. Theres no time for that now since all of their lives are in danger and they have no choice than to face the Night King and his army. He needs his help and that of the Iron Islanders as well during the battle at Winterfell. A disappointed Theon accepts his proposal.

 Missandei visits Daenerys in her chambers. Daenerys tells Missandei that Maester Wolkan examined her and that he confirmed that shes pregnant. Missandei asks why she isnt happy then. Daenerys feels that Jon has changed towards her and doesnt understand why.

 The Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied prepare to leave Winterfell. Jon asks Daenerys why she didnt attend this important gathering, but Daenerys doesnt reply to that as well. Meera goes to say goodbye to Bran in the Godswood in Winterfell when Bran starts to behave very strangely. He pleads Meera to warn them since the Night Kings army is here. Jon is going to say goodbye to Sansa when Meera runs to warn the others. A huge winter storm starts to come closer to Winterfell. Chaos erupts. The North and Daeneryss army gather outside to face the Night Kings army. Jon orders Sansa, Arya and Daenerys to stay inside Winterfell.

They are too valuable to lose and promises them that Winterfell will not fall. Varys, Tyrion, Robin, Samwell, Gilly, Lyanna and Missandei also remain inside Winterfell. Arya first doesnt want to but obeys Jons wish. Sansa asks Meera to get Bran inside asap. A huge flock of wights invade the battlefield of Winterfell. Dothraki face the Army of the Dead first and many of them are taken out quite easily. Lots of wights keep coming. Ghost fights with Jon and saves him at one point from a wight trying to kill him. Ghost is killed off trying to save Jon. Inside Winterfell, Daenerys is frustrated that shes not able to help and that she should fly Drogon to destroy the undead. Missandei answers that its not wise to join the fight while shes pregnant. Sam tries to console Gilly and Little Sam. The news surprises Sansa, Tyrion and Varys. Drogon comes in between and takes out a big chunk of the Night Kings army but also kills some of the Northern bannermen in the process. The White Walkers also enters the stage with the Night King flying Undead Viserion above them. Viserion starts to destroy the Northerns army as well. Lord Glover and Howland Reed die are killed by dragonfire. Tormund leads the Free Folk and fights but is killed by Drogons fire. Drogon also manages to kill an undead giant. Meera wants Bran to leave the Godswood but he tells her he has help and Jon and co. Bran is trying to control Rhaegal with his mind. Meera warns Bran that is too dangerous and that he should stay inside. Jon and Daeneryss army is diminishing greatly since many wights keep coming. White Walkers try to invade Winterfell. Grey Worm faces two White Walkers and is able to take out one of them with his spear from Dragonglass. The other WW kills him. The White Walkers supposedly try to invade Winterfell to take down Bran.

Brienne guards the castle together with Podrick, Jorah and Gendry. Wights and White Walkers and Wights start to invade there as well. Podrick is killed off by a group of Wights, which makes Brienne go psycho and takes out one of the White Walkers as well with Oathkeeper. Meera is urging Bran to give up and get inside but Bran doesnt want to. He wants Meera to leave instead and get safe inside the castle. Meera answers that she will stay together with him until the end. Jaime Lannister and the Tully forces come to the Norths aid right in time. Bran is managing to warg inside Rhaegal and the dragon starts to fight undead Viserion, trying to bite him right in the neck but gets gravely injured during the fight as well. Rhaegal starts to breathe fire on Viserion, which seems to make the Night King start leaving the battlefield on injured Viserions back.

 Meera realizes that this is the end for them. White Walkers are coming for Bran and she gets killed off by the White Walkers while defending Brans body. Viserion and Rhaegal keep fighting each other and both start to be seriously injured. It seems like dragonfire can harm the Night King. The White Walkers stab Bran to death, which makes Rhaegal fall to the ground and to be stabbed to death by Wights. The Night Kings army of Undead is starting to diminish. We see Jaime commanding his men and fighting the remaining Undead alongside Bronn. Jon fights alongside the Hound and Davos. The Hound is fighting like a boss right here. When Jon starts to notice that the Night Kings army is retreating as well he commands everybody to leave the battlefield asap and goes with Davos and the Hound to get everyone safely outside now. The Knights of the Vale, Sansa, Brienne and Robin leave together to the Eyrie. Arya, The Hound, Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Tully and Lannister forces retreat to Riverrun. Jon, Davos, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Samwell, Gilly, Little Sam, Theon, the remaining Unsullied and Dothraki forces travel south. Lyanna Mormont and her men retreat to Bear Island.

 The last shot we see is Jon and Daenerys on Drogons back setting all the dead afire including dead Rhaegal. Both sides suffered great losses in this fight.

 Deaths: Grey Worm, Tormund, Podrick, Meera, Bran, Rhaegal, Robett Glover, Howland Reed

End episode 2

First outline season 8, episode 3

HBO LEAK

 Note that this episode is a bit shorter than the others and has a duration of +/- 60 minutes.

 Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, Robin, Lord Royce, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Varys, Brienne, Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, Davos, Missandei, Little Sam and Theon all arrive in Greywater Watch. Not all of these characters appear on screen though. They make a stop to rest there and to discuss their strategy to defeat the Night King for good.

 Inside Greywater Watch, Daenerys, Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Davos, Robin and Lord Royce discuss how they will organize themselves before splitting up. Jon proposes to await the Night Kings attack from the Eyrie since the fortress is very difficult to impregnate. Tyrion jokes that the Night King only needs 10 good men to impregnate the bitch, but only Bronn catches the joke. The remaining Lannister and Tully army defend Riverrun together with Edmure, Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn. When the Eyrie gets attacked first, the Night Kings army has to get lured into the Bloody Gate and thats when the Lannister and Tully forces need to join the attack as well. Theon has to take back Pyke and defend it together with the remaining army of the North and the Ironborn. Jon remarks that Arya and The Hound have not been seen arriving in Greywater Watch. Edmures assures that Arya hasnt died but simply disappeared when they were retreating from Winterfell. Sansa remarks that shed be safe with the Hound. She always manages to survive somehow. Jon also wants Sansa and Brienne to join Robin and Gendry to the Eyrie where theyd probably be safer than now. Jon stays with Davos, Jaime, Jorah, Bronn, Tyrion and Edmure in Riverrun. Jon wants Daenerys, to travel to Dragonstone together with Varys and Missandei. Sam and Gilly should travel with her.

Maester Wolkan received bad news, though. Lyanna Mormont didnt make it to Bear Island and died.

 Next shot is Arya and the Hound travelling on the Kingsroad. The Hound complains to Arya that she should have followed her brother and sister and that shes a stupid girl to travel alone in the North now that the army of undead fuckers are around. Arya answers the Hound that he shouldnt have sticked with her if hes scared. The Hound deduces that Arya is traveling to Kings Landing, but he doesnt understand why. Arya says that she has to cross one last name off her list. The Hound laughs and tells Arya why shes still holding that fucking list since everyone will die soon anyway. Arya responds that she needs to kill Cersei herself. The Hound agrees and tells that he has some unfinished business with his brother as well. The two encounter by an old woman, whos asking after the King in The North. The Hound says that an old woman shouldnt be alone in the woods with the army of the Night King approaching. The old woman says she doesnt fear the dead. Arya tells the woman she thinks Jon Snow has traveled south, probably to Dragonstone. The old woman takes a look at Arya and tells her that they have met before. Arya is puzzled about this, the Old Woman leaves.

 During the night, the characters at Greywater Watch sleep in huts. Jon chats a last time with Howland Reed, asking if he joins them to the South since the White Walkers would probably hit Greywater Watch soon. Howland Reed tells that hes ready to die. He doesnt care of his life anymore, now with his children being passed away. He tells Jon Snow the Walkers can have him. He tells Jon he also needs to pay for his sins, for killing Arthur Dayne behind his back. He tells Jon the story of how he saw Ned Stark with baby Jon in his arms.

His uncle always wanted to keep him safe, even willing to sacrifice his life for Jon. Howland tells Jon he recognizes a lot of traits of Ned in Jon Snow and says that he would make a good ruler on the Iron Throne. Jon insists that he isnt interested in that and leaves Howland Reed.

 Then, we see Cersei in Kings Landing. Qyburn visits the chamber of the Hand and informs Cersei that Winterfell has been attacked and that Daenerys and Jon have lost a great deal of their army. Cersei smiles. Qyburn also tells that the Lannister army has joined the Battle at Winterfell apperently. Cersei asks if Jaime has survived, but Qyburn tells he doesnt know. Cersei answers that he shouldnt have. After that, Euron arrives back in Kings Landing. He comes to tell Cersei that the Golden Company succefully took Storms End and that the army is gathered right there. He tells Cersei he finally wants to receive his reward and they shouldnt wait to marry and be husband and wife tonight. Cersei reluctantly agrees.

 Its still night in Greywater Watch and the characters stay there until morning. Jon and Daenerys sleep together in a hut. Daenerys finally tells Jon that shes pregnant with his child. Jon is surprised and expresses his happiness toward Daenerys. He jokes that this is the only good thing that happened to them at the moment. He also wonders about their childs health since theyre family. Daenerys comforts Jon the Targaryens have been inbreeding for years and shes perfectly healthy. Daenerys thinks shes having a son again, and asks Jon what he would name their son. Jon thinks he should be named after the greatest person he knew in his life, the one that saved his life, his uncle Ned. He wants his son to be named Eddard Targaryen. Daenerys repeats the name and smiles.

She says she likes it very much. The two start to kiss in their hut. Jaime visits Briennes hut as well. Brienne grieves over Podricks death, telling him that Podrick was the least person to deserves to die like that. Jaime agrees telling Brienne that he was a good lad and he was lucky to have been around Brienne all that time.

 The Hound and Arya make a fire during the night. The Hound asks how she managed to cross off almost every name of her list, but before Arya can respond she tells the Hound to shut up. She hears some strange noises. Not much later, a group of wights attack Arya and the Hound. The two begin to fight the wights but more wights come since theyre attracted to the noise. Its then when Nymeria and a much larger pack of wolves come in between and kill off a big bunch of Wights. A lot of wolves die too. When most of the Wights are killed off, The Hound thinks they should flee as soon as they can before another group of Wights comes to kill them off. Arya discovers that she has lost Needle during the fight, but the Hound insists that theres no time left to search for the damned sword and that they should leave immediately. This time Arya manages to have Nymeria follow her and the Hound.

 The wedding between Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy takes place in the Throne Room. Euron looks very delighted, Cersei not so. Its Qyburn who has them married. Cersei wears a tight, long black dress. She looks quite sad during the wedding. The wedding scene itself doesnt take long and the scene switches to their wedding bed. This scene is an intercut between Cersei and Euron having sex and Jaime and Brienne also having sex in their hut. The two still think of each other.

 Next morning, the group departs from Greywater Watch and Jon and Sansa say goodbye to each other for the time being. Jon asks Gendry to keep his sister safe. Daenerys and Jon also say goodbye and leave each other. Daenerys tells Jon that Drogon should stay with him. Theyll need him to fight the Night King. The two kiss before leaving each other. Jorah is still having difficulties with that. We see all of the character go different ways and thats how the episode ends.

 Died: a lot of Wights and wolves, Lyanna Mormont (off-screen)

End Episode 3

First outline season 8, episode 4

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS MIGHT ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

EDIT: ORIGINALLY, HOWLAND DIED DURING EP.2 BUT THE WRITERS CHOSE TO INCLUDE GREYWATER WATCH LATER ON.

 The first scene will take place in Kings Landing. Cersei speaks with Qyburn, Euron and the three Commanders of the Golden Company. Qyburn informs them that Daenerys and Jon have been splitting up their army and that Jaime is currently with Jon and Edmure in Riverrun, probably awaiting an attack from the Night King. Pyke has been taken again by Theon Greyjoy and Jons army, which visibly angers Euron. Daenerys traveled back to Dragonstone. Cersei laughs and tells the rest she hopes the Night King devours their army soon enough. They shouldnt wait too long and have the Golden Company attack Dragonstone since Daeneryss army is reduced remarkably. Euron Greyjoy is watching the Iron Throne when Cersei joins him in the Throne Room. She asks Euron why he doesnt attack Pyke, since his nephew has taken it from him. Euron initially thinks its a stupid idea to go North now, but Cersei convinces him to learn them another lesson. Euron decides to take his fleet and travels to Pyke.

 Cersei and Qyburn are watching from above how Euron leaves. Qyburn asks Cersei if it is smart to have their most important ally travel so far North at the moment. Cersei tells Qyburn she hopes her enemies deal with Euron Greyjoy and that he never returns to Kings Landing.

 Daenerys, Sam, Gilly, Varys and Missandei have returned to Dragonstone. Varys reports to Daenerys that Cersei has hired the Golden Company and that Eurons ships has been seen leaving Kings Landing. They could attack her any moment, now that her forces are weakened. Daenerys agrees and hopes that Jon and co. finishes the Night Kings army as soon as possible. When Daenerys takes a bath, Missandei remarks that shes visibly pregnant right by now. Daenerys asks Missandei how she deals with Grey Worms death, at which Missandei responds that shes missing him every day. Missandei asks Daenerys whether she misses Jon. Daenerys says she does. Next scene is Samwell with Gilly and Little Sam. Samwell wants Gilly to travel to Horn Hill with Little Sam. They arent safe in Dragonstone with enemies from all sides. Gilly reminds Sam that he promised her not to leave them, but Sam insists that they must. Theyll be safe with his mother and sister. He promises that hell fight for them.

 Jaime, Jon, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah and Edmure are already in Riverrun. Jon mentions that the Army of the Dead has been seen reaching the Twins. They will be upon them soon and tells them they should take their armies to the Eyrie immediately. Tyrion takes the time to ask Jaime about Cersei and why he chosen to leave her. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei will never find peace after the deaths of their children and chose to betray everybody during the Dragonpit by hiring the Golden Company. Their relationship fully consumed him. Tyrion reminds the rest that Daenerys isnt safe in Dragonstone, now that Cersei has an army of thousands of sellswords behind her back. She could attack Dragonstone any moment from now. Jorah think his place should be with his queen now as he promised to protect her at any cost. Jon seems to agree and lets him go.

Jon sends word to his sister, Sansa, to inform her that the Army of the Dead will reach the Vale soon and that their army is marching to the Vale now.

 Cersei stands with the commanders of the Golden Company on the giant map of Westeros. She instructs the commanders to take their men to Dragonstone with Eurons remaining ships and to capture Daenerys Targaryen. She cant wait to kill the foreign whore herself. The commanders leave and obey her orders.

 Sansa receives word from Jon Snow and orders the Lords of the Vale that they should prepare now. She convinces Robin Arryn to have Lord Royce lead the Knights of the Vale. Robin tells Sansa he intends to fight with them. Sansa answers Robin that its not a good idea and that he should be kept safe. Robin laughs and tells Sansa that hes not a girl, unlike Sansa. Gendry and Sansa have a conversation as well. Sansa asks how Gendry came to meet Arya, but he tells Sansa that the story is too long to tell. The two seem to get well along and Sansa thanks him for fighting with them.

 Missandei receives a visitor in Dragonstone. She first asks after Jon Snow, but is happy to meet Daenerys as well. It seems to be old Melisandre who comes to bring them important news. Old Melisandre tells them that a great last sacrifice should be made if they want to win the war and that it requires true kings blood. Old Melisandre points at Daeneryss baby. Daenerys is furious at the old lady and sends her away immediately. Before Old Melisandre leaves, Varys talks with her outside. Melisandre makes her identity known, which has Varys shocked. She tells Varys that he should remember what the voice said in the flames. He should be the one to save the common people from the doom. She asks Varys to fulfill the prophecy and save Westeros. Varys cant utter a word. Melisandre leaves Dragonstone and the series.

 The next shot takes place in Pyke. Theon Greyjoy is sitting on his fathers chair when his men come to tell him that Euron Greyjoy has arrived in Pyke as well. Euron speaks with Theon outside. He has Yara with him and tells Theon that he should give up Pyke already or hell slit his sisters throat in front of him. Theon is starting to notice that its getting a lot colder and he can see his breath. He tells Euron that they are coming for them, but Euron doesnt understand at first. Men start to scream and Wights start invading Pyke. Yara takes adventage of the moment and kicks Euron. Theon implores Yara to escape to Dragonstone. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he wont fail her another time. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he wont fail her another time. She escapes on a small ship with a few loyal men. Theon fights Euron himself. Ironborn and Northmen fight the wights, while Euron battles Theon. Euron gets the upper-hand and swings his axe Theon right in Theons body. Theon dies immediately, Euron laughs. Euron implores his men to leave Pyke with the boats. A lot of his men have died, but Euron manages to escape.

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

NOTE: DURATION TIME (=/- 100 min.)

 First scene will only include the soundtrack of R. Djawadi, theres no dialogue in the first five minutes. We first see the Knights of the Vale preparing themselves for an attack. We get a shot of the Lannister, Tully and Stark army marching to the Vale. Jaime, Tyrion, Edmure and Bronn are seen leading their men. Then we see the Golden Company getting on board of Euron Greyjoys ships. The Knights of the Vale see a huge storm approaching slowly, Yohn Royce is commanding the Army of the Vale to keep their spears of dragonglass ready. Robin Arryn fights alongside Yohn Royce. Lord Royce isnt too pleased to have Robin Arryn commanding their men. You can literally read that from his face.

 First line comes from Yohn Royce who commands his men to keep ready. Wights start to invade the Bloody Gate. Robin Arryn is commanding the archers, but fails miserably. Inside the Eyrie, we see Lady Sansa together with Gendry and Brienne of Tarth. Gendry says goodbye to Sansa and joins the fight. Sansa tells Gendry she hopes hell come back. Gendry expresses his doubt. Brienne of Tarth also wants to join the fight, but Sansa isnt too fond of that idea. She wants Brienne to stay with her, but Brienne says she cant save Sansa if the Wights invade inside the Eyrie as well. She swore to protect Sansa and the best way to do that is to keep the entry of the Vale safe from the Night Kings army. Sansa hugs Brienne and thanks her for everything she has done to protect her family. Brienne leaves to join the fight.

 Next scene takes place in Dragonstone. News reaches Dragonstone that the Golden Company is on their way to attack Queen Daenerys. Daenerys commands her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki to protect Dragonstone from invading there. Varys advises her to leave Dragonstone immediately, but Daenerys doesnt listen to his counsel. She realizes that her water has broken and shes ready to labor. Missandei and Samwell help Daenerys and make her rest right away. Samwell is worried because Daeneryss baby is coming way to soon.

 Then we see three White Walkers from a distance watching how the Wights win from the Knights of the Vale. The Night King is flying on Viserion above the White Walkers, watching the spectacle as well. Viserion apparently has lost one of his eyes and his right wing got gravely injured. Brienne is fighting for her life. Robin Arryn is almost attacked by several Wights and runs away to hide inside of the Eyrie. Sansa confronts him that he promised to fight with his men, but Robin expresses his lack of interest in the survival of his men.

Brienne, Lord Royce and Gendry continue to fight but it looks like a losing side until now. The White Walkers now start to invade the Eyrie as well. A roaring Undead Dragon can be heard. A one blue-eyed Undead Viserion flies above Lord Royce and his men and sets them afire. Then we hear the roaring of another dragon. The Night King looks behind and sees Jon Snow on Drogon helping the Lord of Vale out. Beneath Jon Snow, we see the Tully, Lannister and Northern forces joining the fray. Lots of Wights are set afire by Drogon while the Westerosi armies slaughter them. It looks like the Dragonfire doesnt affect the White Walkers, though. Bronn manages to kill of a White Walker with two spears of Dragonglass. Jaime sees that Brienne is getting in trouble with another White Walker. She gets stabbed right in the guts and thats when Jaime goes mad and stabs the WW from behind. Brienne is dying and Jaime holds her in her arms. She asks Jaime to keep Sansa and Arya safe, as she promised that to Lady Catelyn. Jaime says he will do that for her. Brienne last words are that Jaime is a honorable man. She dies in his arms.

 Arya, the Hound and Nymeria are entering a snowy Kings Landing. The Hound remarks that he hasnt missed the stinking city at all and Arya agrees. Arya notices that the city has changed a lot since she has left and walks past a destroyed Sept of Baelor. To be in the same place again reminds her of Ned Stark. She tells the Hound its time to pay the Lannisters their debts.

 Daenerys is starting to labor. Its Samwell and Missandei who help her with it. Varys witnesses how a smaller part of the Golden Company is invading the shores of Dragonstone. The Unsullied try to stop them from entering the stairs to the castle. The Dothraki fight them on shore. Jorah and a small part of the Northern army join the fight as well. Jorah tries to get inside the castle to protect Daenerys.

 In the Eyrie, the army of the Undead is diminishing by the second. Edmure is leading his men very well; Tyrion does too. The Night King is no longer mounting Viserion and tries to get inside the Eyrie with another White Walker. Viserion tries to attack Gendry and opens his mouth to spit fire on him. Gendry mounts a spear of Dragonglass in the mouth of the dragon. Undead Viserion falls from the rocks of the bloody gate and it is Drogon who finishes the job and sets Viserion on fire.

 Jorah has made it into Dragonstone and finds Daenerys laboring. Things dont look too bright for her. A sad Samwell concludes that both mother and child could never survive together and he only can save one of them. Jorah wants Daenerys to survive but Daenerys doesnt want to give up on her baby. Samwell sets through and Daenerys manages to deliver her baby. Samwell tells Daenerys that she has delivered a girl and asks for her name. A very weakened Daenerys wants to name her baby Lyanna, as Jon would have liked that. Daenerys is dying and Missandei, Varys and Jorah realize that. The Golden Company is getting the upper-hand and start to invade the stairs to Dragonstone as well. Daenerys says goodbye to Jorah and thanks him for always being there for her. Jorah expresses his love for her and Daenerys asks Jorah to continue his oath and to keep her daughter safe for her together with Missandei. She asks Jorah to release her from her suffering and to kill her. Jorah says he never could and its Varys who puts Samwells sword, Heartsbane, through Daeneryss chest.

 Cersei Lannister and the Mountain receive Qyburn in the Throne Room. He comes to tell her that Daenerys has been defeated. Cersei laughes and both drink to celebrate their victory. Cersei begins to feel dizzy and the audience realizes that its Arya with Qyburns face. She has poisoned Cersei with Jaqens vial. Qyburn starts to confront her and Cersei realizes that something is not right here. Thats when Arya makes her identity known. She tells Cersei that a lion should never have fought with a pack of wolves. Cersei begs The Mountain to kill off Arya but Arya tells her that wont help. She brings in Nymeria and the Hound to finish the job. Nymeria gravely injures Cersei and the Hound combats with the Mountain. Its Arya who finishes Cersei and slits her throat. Nymeria and the Hound destroys the Mountain but he doesnt seem to die. The Mountain loses his helmet at some point and thats when the Hound manages to burn his face with fire. The Mountain is left to die and The Hound, Arya and Nymeria leave The Red Keep.

 The Commanders of the Golden Company have entered the castle and order Varys to hand over Daenerys to them. Varys tell them that Daenerys has died and the Commanders clear Varys out of their way and stab him. They indeed find Daeneryss body and take her body with them to bring it to Queen Cersei. Samwell is able to hide himself together with Missandei and Danys baby. The Golden Company retreat back to Kings Landing.

 Euron Greyjoy arrives back in Kings Landing to find out that Queen Cersei has been slaughtered. He pretends to be saddened by her death.

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark arrive back in Dragonstone to find out that everyone has been slaughtered. Samwell meets him on the stairs with Jons child in his arms. Jon starts to weep. He asks if Daenerys has made it, but Samwell is sad to tell him she has not. He tells him she named their daughter Lyanna Targaryen.

 The last scene of the episode is the coronation of King Euron I Greyjoy. He is made King of the Seven Kingdoms.

First outline season 8, episode 2

HBO LEAK

 The episode will have a duration of almost 2 hours.

 The first scene will take place in the Great Hall of Winterfell. Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Davos and Sansa are present here. Gendry and Tormund tell the rest that the Wall has fallen and the Night Watch destroyed. Tormund also mentions that the Night King rides an undead dragon and that they are severely fucked. Bran Stark confirms Gendry and Tormunds story and tells that the Night King is on his way to Winterfell. Jon Snow tells the rest that they have no time to lose and asks Maester Wolkan to inform all of their banners, everyone in the North, to prepare themselves for a war against the Army of the Dead. They need to prepare for an attack at the battlefield of Winterfell.

 After having to process a lot of new information and struggling with his identity, Jon Snow goes to the crypts to visit his mother, Lyanna and his uncle, Ned Stark. Daenerys notices that theres something wrong with Jon and finds him in the crypts. She asks Jon whats wrong with him. Jon tells her that he even isnt called Jon Snow. He calls Jon Snow a lie people have made him believe all of life. Daenerys is confused and asks Jon for clarification but Jon walks away from her. Daenerys notices that Jon behaves aloof toward her.

 Daenerys walks out of the crypts, which Jorah Mormont notices. He asks her what happened down them in the crypts but Daenerys answers that she doesnt know whats up with Jon. She tells Jorah that Jon is hiding something from her. Jorah also tells Daenerys that it striked him that Daenerys has been so absent for days. She answers that shes not feeling very well lately. Jorah proposes to have her examined by Maester Wolkan.

 Qyburn enters Cerseis chambers. He mentions that she hasnt spoken about her miscarriage anymore and that she needs to take enough time to rest. Cersei answers that theres no time for that and doesnt want to say more about the miscarriage. Qyburn leaves her chambers, Cersei watches from her window, witnessing how the snow falls in Kings Landing. The next shot is Jaime, riding his horse in snowy conditions. He and Bronn arrive in Riverrun, both discover that the Tullys are once again laying siege to Riverrun. Jaime enters the stage and meets up with Edmure. Edmure tells Jaime he should have him in chains, but Jaime responds that he doesnt come to argue about the damned castle. He proposes Edmure to help his niece and nephew in the Great War against the Night King. He also promises to give Edmure Riverrun back to the Tullys, since it doesnt matter any longer whos holding the castle at this point. Edmure tends to agree, not for Jaime but for his family.

 Most of House Starks bannermen and Daeneryss army have now arrived in Winterfell. Among them is Howland Reed. He arrived with his army and Meera Reed by his side. Arya receives a visitor in Winterfell. He seems to be an ordinary bannerman from House Cerwyn, but he quickly removes his face. It seems to be Jaqen Hghar. Arya is surprised to have Jaqen visiting her. Jaqen tells Arya the Many-Faced God requires another death, a name to be crossed off her list. He reveals it to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister. A price was paid. What better servant of the Many-Faced God than Arya Stark can kill Cersei Lannister. He gives a vial of poison to Arya and leaves her.

 Jon Snow seizes the moment to talk with Howland Reed alone. He asks Howland to confirm Brans story, but Howland doesnt acknowledge this at all. Jon Snow pleads him to tell the truth since Robert Baratheon isnt alive any longer, theres no point in lying anymore. Howland ultimately confirms that Ned was carrying Lyannas child when he came out of the Tower of Joy. He always promised him to keep this a secret. Jon thanks him for telling the truth anyway.

 Knowing that the Army of the Undead will be upon them very soon, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Podrick, Davos, Tormund, Gendry, Varys, Jorah, Theon, The Hound, Grey Worm and Sam discuss together with the Stark bannermen and Daeneryss army how they will defend the North. Allegedly the Last Hearth has already been attacked by the White Walkers and their castle destroyed. Ned Umber didnt make it out alive. Tyrion speaks for Daenerys, whos absent due to illness. He comes forward with a plan to defend the North. Tormund, the remaining Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied will attack with dragonglass from the Dreadfort since thats where they are heading to first. On their way to Winterfell, the dragons will set the army of the Dead afire and House Starks bannermen and the Knights of the Vale will fight weakened forces at the battlefield of Winterfell and hopefully destroy the Night King as well. Jon wants Brienne and Podrick to take Sansa and Arya and Bran with them and to leave with Robin Arryn to the Eyrie.

Arya doesnt want to and claims that shes stronger than most men. They need her in the war to come. Jon insists that he doesnt want that. Jorah also wants to fight alongside House Mormont but Lyanna reminds him that he has betrayed his own House. Varys mentions that he has also received word from Kings Landing. Supposedly, Queen Cersei has bought a great army of sellswords and Euron Greyjoy has taken Storms End to install the army there. Theon pleads to have Storms End attacked and Gendry agrees since its the seat of his fathers house. Jon promises Theon that he will help to destroy Euron and save his sister after they have dealt with the Night King and his army. Theres no time for that now since all of their lives are in danger and they have no choice than to face the Night King and his army. He needs his help and that of the Iron Islanders as well during the battle at Winterfell. A disappointed Theon accepts his proposal.

 Missandei visits Daenerys in her chambers. Daenerys tells Missandei that Maester Wolkan examined her and that he confirmed that shes pregnant. Missandei asks why she isnt happy then. Daenerys feels that Jon has changed towards her and doesnt understand why.

 The Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied prepare to leave Winterfell. Jon asks Daenerys why she didnt attend this important gathering, but Daenerys doesnt reply to that as well. Meera goes to say goodbye to Bran in the Godswood in Winterfell when Bran starts to behave very strangely. He pleads Meera to warn them since the Night Kings army is here. Jon is going to say goodbye to Sansa when Meera runs to warn the others. A huge winter storm starts to come closer to Winterfell. Chaos erupts. The North and Daeneryss army gather outside to face the Night Kings army. Jon orders Sansa, Arya and Daenerys to stay inside Winterfell.

They are too valuable to lose and promises them that Winterfell will not fall. Varys, Tyrion, Robin, Samwell, Gilly, Lyanna and Missandei also remain inside Winterfell. Arya first doesnt want to but obeys Jons wish. Sansa asks Meera to get Bran inside asap. A huge flock of wights invade the battlefield of Winterfell. Dothraki face the Army of the Dead first and many of them are taken out quite easily. Lots of wights keep coming. Ghost fights with Jon and saves him at one point from a wight trying to kill him. Ghost is killed off trying to save Jon. Inside Winterfell, Daenerys is frustrated that shes not able to help and that she should fly Drogon to destroy the undead. Missandei answers that its not wise to join the fight while shes pregnant. Sam tries to console Gilly and Little Sam. The news surprises Sansa, Tyrion and Varys. Drogon comes in between and takes out a big chunk of the Night Kings army but also kills some of the Northern bannermen in the process. The White Walkers also enters the stage with the Night King flying Undead Viserion above them. Viserion starts to destroy the Northerns army as well. Lord Glover and Howland Reed die are killed by dragonfire. Tormund leads the Free Folk and fights but is killed by Drogons fire. Drogon also manages to kill an undead giant. Meera wants Bran to leave the Godswood but he tells her he has help and Jon and co. Bran is trying to control Rhaegal with his mind. Meera warns Bran that is too dangerous and that he should stay inside. Jon and Daeneryss army is diminishing greatly since many wights keep coming. White Walkers try to invade Winterfell. Grey Worm faces two White Walkers and is able to take out one of them with his spear from Dragonglass. The other WW kills him. The White Walkers supposedly try to invade Winterfell to take down Bran.

Brienne guards the castle together with Podrick, Jorah and Gendry. Wights and White Walkers and Wights start to invade there as well. Podrick is killed off by a group of Wights, which makes Brienne go psycho and takes out one of the White Walkers as well with Oathkeeper. Meera is urging Bran to give up and get inside but Bran doesnt want to. He wants Meera to leave instead and get safe inside the castle. Meera answers that she will stay together with him until the end. Jaime Lannister and the Tully forces come to the Norths aid right in time. Bran is managing to warg inside Rhaegal and the dragon starts to fight undead Viserion, trying to bite him right in the neck but gets gravely injured during the fight as well. Rhaegal starts to breathe fire on Viserion, which seems to make the Night King start leaving the battlefield on injured Viserions back.

 Meera realizes that this is the end for them. White Walkers are coming for Bran and she gets killed off by the White Walkers while defending Brans body. Viserion and Rhaegal keep fighting each other and both start to be seriously injured. It seems like dragonfire can harm the Night King. The White Walkers stab Bran to death, which makes Rhaegal fall to the ground and to be stabbed to death by Wights. The Night Kings army of Undead is starting to diminish. We see Jaime commanding his men and fighting the remaining Undead alongside Bronn. Jon fights alongside the Hound and Davos. The Hound is fighting like a boss right here. When Jon starts to notice that the Night Kings army is retreating as well he commands everybody to leave the battlefield asap and goes with Davos and the Hound to get everyone safely outside now. The Knights of the Vale, Sansa, Brienne and Robin leave together to the Eyrie. Arya, The Hound, Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Tully and Lannister forces retreat to Riverrun. Jon, Davos, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Samwell, Gilly, Little Sam, Theon, the remaining Unsullied and Dothraki forces travel south. Lyanna Mormont and her men retreat to Bear Island.

 The last shot we see is Jon and Daenerys on Drogons back setting all the dead afire including dead Rhaegal. Both sides suffered great losses in this fight.

End episode 2

First outline season 8, episode 3

HBO LEAK

 Note that this episode is a bit shorter than the others and has a duration of +/- 60 minutes.

 Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, Robin, Lord Royce, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Varys, Brienne, Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, Davos, Missandei, Little Sam and Theon all arrive in Greywater Watch. Not all of these characters appear on screen though. They make a stop to rest there and to discuss their strategy to defeat the Night King for good.

 Inside Greywater Watch, Daenerys, Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Davos, Robin and Lord Royce discuss how they will organize themselves before splitting up. Jon proposes to await the Night Kings attack from the Eyrie since the fortress is very difficult to impregnate. Tyrion jokes that the Night King only needs 10 good men to impregnate the bitch, but only Bronn catches the joke. The remaining Lannister and Tully army defend Riverrun together with Edmure, Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn. When the Eyrie gets attacked first, the Night Kings army has to get lured into the Bloody Gate and thats when the Lannister and Tully forces need to join the attack as well. Theon has to take back Pyke and defend it together with the remaining army of the North and the Ironborn. Jon remarks that Arya and The Hound have not been seen arriving in Greywater Watch. Edmures assures that Arya hasnt died but simply disappeared when they were retreating from Winterfell. Sansa remarks that shed be safe with the Hound. She always manages to survive somehow. Jon also wants Sansa and Brienne to join Robin and Gendry to the Eyrie where theyd probably be safer than now. Jon stays with Davos, Jaime, Jorah, Bronn, Tyrion and Edmure in Riverrun. Jon wants Daenerys, to travel to Dragonstone together with Varys and Missandei. Sam and Gilly should travel with her.

Maester Wolkan received bad news, though. Lyanna Mormont didnt make it to Bear Island and died.

 Next shot is Arya and the Hound travelling on the Kingsroad. The Hound complains to Arya that she should have followed her brother and sister and that shes a stupid girl to travel alone in the North now that the army of undead fuckers are around. Arya answers the Hound that he shouldnt have sticked with her if hes scared. The Hound deduces that Arya is traveling to Kings Landing, but he doesnt understand why. Arya says that she has to cross one last name off her list. The Hound laughs and tells Arya why shes still holding that fucking list since everyone will die soon anyway. Arya responds that she needs to kill Cersei herself. The Hound agrees and tells that he has some unfinished business with his brother as well. The two encounter by an old woman, whos asking after the King in The North. The Hound says that an old woman shouldnt be alone in the woods with the army of the Night King approaching. The old woman says she doesnt fear the dead. Arya tells the woman she thinks Jon Snow has traveled south, probably to Dragonstone. The old woman takes a look at Arya and tells her that they have met before. Arya is puzzled about this, the Old Woman leaves.

 During the night, the characters at Greywater Watch sleep in huts. Jon chats a last time with Howland Reed, asking if he joins them to the South since the White Walkers would probably hit Greywater Watch soon. Howland Reed tells that hes ready to die. He doesnt care of his life anymore, now with his children being passed away. He tells Jon Snow the Walkers can have him. He tells Jon he also needs to pay for his sins, for killing Arthur Dayne behind his back. He tells Jon the story of how he saw Ned Stark with baby Jon in his arms.

His uncle always wanted to keep him safe, even willing to sacrifice his life for Jon. Howland tells Jon he recognizes a lot of traits of Ned in Jon Snow and says that he would make a good ruler on the Iron Throne. Jon insists that he isnt interested in that and leaves Howland Reed.

 Then, we see Cersei in Kings Landing. Qyburn visits the chamber of the Hand and informs Cersei that Winterfell has been attacked and that Daenerys and Jon have lost a great deal of their army. Cersei smiles. Qyburn also tells that the Lannister army has joined the Battle at Winterfell apperently. Cersei asks if Jaime has survived, but Qyburn tells he doesnt know. Cersei answers that he shouldnt have. After that, Euron arrives back in Kings Landing. He comes to tell Cersei that the Golden Company succefully took Storms End and that the army is gathered right there. He tells Cersei he finally wants to receive his reward and they shouldnt wait to marry and be husband and wife tonight. Cersei reluctantly agrees.

 Its still night in Greywater Watch and the characters stay there until morning. Jon and Daenerys sleep together in a hut. Daenerys finally tells Jon that shes pregnant with his child. Jon is surprised and expresses his happiness toward Daenerys. He jokes that this is the only good thing that happened to them at the moment. He also wonders about their childs health since theyre family. Daenerys comforts Jon the Targaryens have been inbreeding for years and shes perfectly healthy. Daenerys thinks shes having a son again, and asks Jon what he would name their son. Jon thinks he should be named after the greatest person he knew in his life, the one that saved his life, his uncle Ned. He wants his son to be named Eddard Targaryen. Daenerys repeats the name and smiles.

She says she likes it very much. The two start to kiss in their hut. Jaime visits Briennes hut as well. Brienne grieves over Podricks death, telling him that Podrick was the least person to deserves to die like that. Jaime agrees telling Brienne that he was a good lad and he was lucky to have been around Brienne all that time.

 The Hound and Arya make a fire during the night. The Hound asks how she managed to cross off almost every name of her list, but before Arya can respond she tells the Hound to shut up. She hears some strange noises. Not much later, a group of wights attack Arya and the Hound. The two begin to fight the wights but more wights come since theyre attracted to the noise. Its then when Nymeria and a much larger pack of wolves come in between and kill off a big bunch of Wights. A lot of wolves die too. When most of the Wights are killed off, The Hound thinks they should flee as soon as they can before another group of Wights comes to kill them off. Arya discovers that she has lost Needle during the fight, but the Hound insists that theres no time left to search for the damned sword and that they should leave immediately. This time Arya manages to have Nymeria follow her and the Hound.

 The wedding between Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy takes place in the Throne Room. Euron looks very delighted, Cersei not so. Its Qyburn who has them married. Cersei wears a tight, long black dress. She looks quite sad during the wedding. The wedding scene itself doesnt take long and the scene switches to their wedding bed. This scene is an intercut between Cersei and Euron having sex and Jaime and Brienne also having sex in their hut. The two still think of each other.

 Next morning, the group departs from Greywater Watch and Jon and Sansa say goodbye to each other for the time being. Jon asks Gendry to keep his sister safe. Daenerys and Jon also say goodbye and leave each other. Daenerys tells Jon that Drogon should stay with him. Theyll need him to fight the Night King. The two kiss before leaving each other. Jorah is still having difficulties with that. We see all of the character go different ways and thats how the episode ends.

 Died: a lot of Wights and wolves, Lyanna Mormont (off-screen)

End Episode 3

First outline season 8, episode 4

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS MIGHT ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

EDIT: ORIGINALLY, HOWLAND DIED DURING EP.2 BUT THE WRITERS CHOSE TO INCLUDE GREYWATER WATCH LATER ON.

 The first scene will take place in Kings Landing. Cersei speaks with Qyburn, Euron and the three Commanders of the Golden Company. Qyburn informs them that Daenerys and Jon have been splitting up their army and that Jaime is currently with Jon and Edmure in Riverrun, probably awaiting an attack from the Night King. Pyke has been taken again by Theon Greyjoy and Jons army, which visibly angers Euron. Daenerys traveled back to Dragonstone. Cersei laughs and tells the rest she hopes the Night King devours their army soon enough. They shouldnt wait too long and have the Golden Company attack Dragonstone since Daeneryss army is reduced remarkably. Euron Greyjoy is watching the Iron Throne when Cersei joins him in the Throne Room. She asks Euron why he doesnt attack Pyke, since his nephew has taken it from him. Euron initially thinks its a stupid idea to go North now, but Cersei convinces him to learn them another lesson. Euron decides to take his fleet and travels to Pyke.

 Cersei and Qyburn are watching from above how Euron leaves. Qyburn asks Cersei if it is smart to have their most important ally travel so far North at the moment. Cersei tells Qyburn she hopes her enemies deal with Euron Greyjoy and that he never returns to Kings Landing.

 Daenerys, Sam, Gilly, Varys and Missandei have returned to Dragonstone. Varys reports to Daenerys that Cersei has hired the Golden Company and that Eurons ships has been seen leaving Kings Landing. They could attack her any moment, now that her forces are weakened. Daenerys agrees and hopes that Jon and co. finishes the Night Kings army as soon as possible. When Daenerys takes a bath, Missandei remarks that shes visibly pregnant right by now. Daenerys asks Missandei how she deals with Grey Worms death, at which Missandei responds that shes missing him every day. Missandei asks Daenerys whether she misses Jon. Daenerys says she does. Next scene is Samwell with Gilly and Little Sam. Samwell wants Gilly to travel to Horn Hill with Little Sam. They arent safe in Dragonstone with enemies from all sides. Gilly reminds Sam that he promised her not to leave them, but Sam insists that they must. Theyll be safe with his mother and sister. He promises that hell fight for them.

 Jaime, Jon, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah and Edmure are already in Riverrun. Jon mentions that the Army of the Dead has been seen reaching the Twins. They will be upon them soon and tells them they should take their armies to the Eyrie immediately. Tyrion takes the time to ask Jaime about Cersei and why he chosen to leave her. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei will never find peace after the deaths of their children and chose to betray everybody during the Dragonpit by hiring the Golden Company. Their relationship fully consumed him. Tyrion reminds the rest that Daenerys isnt safe in Dragonstone, now that Cersei has an army of thousands of sellswords behind her back. She could attack Dragonstone any moment from now. Jorah think his place should be with his queen now as he promised to protect her at any cost. Jon seems to agree and lets him go.

Jon sends word to his sister, Sansa, to inform her that the Army of the Dead will reach the Vale soon and that their army is marching to the Vale now.

 Cersei stands with the commanders of the Golden Company on the giant map of Westeros. She instructs the commanders to take their men to Dragonstone with Eurons remaining ships and to capture Daenerys Targaryen. She cant wait to kill the foreign whore herself. The commanders leave and obey her orders.

 Sansa receives word from Jon Snow and orders the Lords of the Vale that they should prepare now. She convinces Robin Arryn to have Lord Royce lead the Knights of the Vale. Robin tells Sansa he intends to fight with them. Sansa answers Robin that its not a good idea and that he should be kept safe. Robin laughs and tells Sansa that hes not a girl, unlike Sansa. Gendry and Sansa have a conversation as well. Sansa asks how Gendry came to meet Arya, but he tells Sansa that the story is too long to tell. The two seem to get well along and Sansa thanks him for fighting with them.

 Missandei receives a visitor in Dragonstone. She first asks after Jon Snow, but is happy to meet Daenerys as well. It seems to be old Melisandre who comes to bring them important news. Old Melisandre tells them that a great last sacrifice should be made if they want to win the war and that it requires true kings blood. Old Melisandre points at Daeneryss baby. Daenerys is furious at the old lady and sends her away immediately. Before Old Melisandre leaves, Varys talks with her outside. Melisandre makes her identity known, which has Varys shocked. She tells Varys that he should remember what the voice said in the flames. He should be the one to save the common people from the doom. She asks Varys to fulfill the prophecy and save Westeros. Varys cant utter a word. Melisandre leaves Dragonstone and the series.

 The next shot takes place in Pyke. Theon Greyjoy is sitting on his fathers chair when his men come to tell him that Euron Greyjoy has arrived in Pyke as well. Euron speaks with Theon outside. He has Yara with him and tells Theon that he should give up Pyke already or hell slit his sisters throat in front of him. Theon is starting to notice that its getting a lot colder and he can see his breath. He tells Euron that they are coming for them, but Euron doesnt understand at first. Men start to scream and Wights start invading Pyke. Yara takes adventage of the moment and kicks Euron. Theon implores Yara to escape to Dragonstone. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he wont fail her another time. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he wont fail her another time. She escapes on a small ship with a few loyal men. Theon fights Euron himself. Ironborn and Northmen fight the wights, while Euron battles Theon. Euron gets the upper-hand and swings his axe Theon right in Theons body. Theon dies immediately, Euron laughs. Euron implores his men to leave Pyke with the boats. A lot of his men have died, but Euron manages to escape.

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

NOTE: DURATION TIME (=/- 100 min.)

 First scene will only include the soundtrack of R. Djawadi, theres no dialogue in the first five minutes. We first see the Knights of the Vale preparing themselves for an attack. We get a shot of the Lannister, Tully and Stark army marching to the Vale. Jaime, Tyrion, Edmure and Bronn are seen leading their men. Then we see the Golden Company getting on board of Euron Greyjoys ships. The Knights of the Vale see a huge storm approaching slowly, Yohn Royce is commanding the Army of the Vale to keep their spears of dragonglass ready. Robin Arryn fights alongside Yohn Royce. Lord Royce isnt too pleased to have Robin Arryn commanding their men. You can literally read that from his face.

 First line comes from Yohn Royce who commands his men to keep ready. Wights start to invade the Bloody Gate. Robin Arryn is commanding the archers, but fails miserably. Inside the Eyrie, we see Lady Sansa together with Gendry and Brienne of Tarth. Gendry says goodbye to Sansa and joins the fight. Sansa tells Gendry she hopes hell come back. Gendry expresses his doubt. Brienne of Tarth also wants to join the fight, but Sansa isnt too fond of that idea. She wants Brienne to stay with her, but Brienne says she cant save Sansa if the Wights invade inside the Eyrie as well. She swore to protect Sansa and the best way to do that is to keep the entry of the Vale safe from the Night Kings army. Sansa hugs Brienne and thanks her for everything she has done to protect her family. Brienne leaves to join the fight.

 Next scene takes place in Dragonstone. News reaches Dragonstone that the Golden Company is on their way to attack Queen Daenerys. Daenerys commands her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki to protect Dragonstone from invading there. Varys advises her to leave Dragonstone immediately, but Daenerys doesnt listen to his counsel. She realizes that her water has broken and shes ready to labor. Missandei and Samwell help Daenerys and make her rest right away. Samwell is worried because Daeneryss baby is coming way to soon.

 Then we see three White Walkers from a distance watching how the Wights win from the Knights of the Vale. The Night King is flying on Viserion above the White Walkers, watching the spectacle as well. Viserion apparently has lost one of his eyes and his right wing got gravely injured. Brienne is fighting for her life. Robin Arryn is almost attacked by several Wights and runs away to hide inside of the Eyrie. Sansa confronts him that he promised to fight with his men, but Robin expresses his lack of interest in the survival of his men.

Brienne, Lord Royce and Gendry continue to fight but it looks like a losing side until now. The White Walkers now start to invade the Eyrie as well. A roaring Undead Dragon can be heard. A one blue-eyed Undead Viserion flies above Lord Royce and his men and sets them afire. Then we hear the roaring of another dragon. The Night King looks behind and sees Jon Snow on Drogon helping the Lord of Vale out. Beneath Jon Snow, we see the Tully, Lannister and Northern forces joining the fray. Lots of Wights are set afire by Drogon while the Westerosi armies slaughter them. It looks like the Dragonfire doesnt affect the White Walkers, though. Bronn manages to kill of a White Walker with two spears of Dragonglass. Jaime sees that Brienne is getting in trouble with another White Walker. She gets stabbed right in the guts and thats when Jaime goes mad and stabs the WW from behind. Brienne is dying and Jaime holds her in her arms. She asks Jaime to keep Sansa and Arya safe, as she promised that to Lady Catelyn. Jaime says he will do that for her. Brienne last words are that Jaime is a honorable man. She dies in his arms.

 Arya, the Hound and Nymeria are entering a snowy Kings Landing. The Hound remarks that he hasnt missed the stinking city at all and Arya agrees. Arya notices that the city has changed a lot since she has left and walks past a destroyed Sept of Baelor. To be in the same place again reminds her of Ned Stark. She tells the Hound its time to pay the Lannisters their debts.

 Daenerys is starting to labor. Its Samwell and Missandei who help her with it. Varys witnesses how a smaller part of the Golden Company is invading the shores of Dragonstone. The Unsullied try to stop them from entering the stairs to the castle. The Dothraki fight them on shore. Jorah and a small part of the Northern army join the fight as well. Jorah tries to get inside the castle to protect Daenerys.

 In the Eyrie, the army of the Undead is diminishing by the second. Edmure is leading his men very well; Tyrion does too. The Night King is no longer mounting Viserion and tries to get inside the Eyrie with another White Walker. Viserion tries to attack Gendry and opens his mouth to spit fire on him. Gendry mounts a spear of Dragonglass in the mouth of the dragon. Undead Viserion falls from the rocks of the bloody gate and it is Drogon who finishes the job and sets Viserion on fire.

 Jorah has made it into Dragonstone and finds Daenerys laboring. Things dont look too bright for her. A sad Samwell concludes that both mother and child could never survive together and he only can save one of them. Jorah wants Daenerys to survive but Daenerys doesnt want to give up on her baby. Samwell sets through and Daenerys manages to deliver her baby. Samwell tells Daenerys that she has delivered a girl and asks for her name. A very weakened Daenerys wants to name her baby Lyanna, as Jon would have liked that. Daenerys is dying and Missandei, Varys and Jorah realize that. The Golden Company is getting the upper-hand and start to invade the stairs to Dragonstone as well. Daenerys says goodbye to Jorah and thanks him for always being there for her. Jorah expresses his love for her and Daenerys asks Jorah to continue his oath and to keep her daughter safe for her together with Missandei. She asks Jorah to release her from her suffering and to kill her. Jorah says he never could and its Varys who puts Samwells sword, Heartsbane, through Daeneryss chest.

 Cersei Lannister and the Mountain receive Qyburn in the Throne Room. He comes to tell her that Daenerys has been defeated. Cersei laughes and both drink to celebrate their victory. Cersei begins to feel dizzy and the audience realizes that its Arya with Qyburns face. She has poisoned Cersei with Jaqens vial. Qyburn starts to confront her and Cersei realizes that something is not right here. Thats when Arya makes her identity known. She tells Cersei that a lion should never have fought with a pack of wolves. Cersei begs The Mountain to kill off Arya but Arya tells her that wont help. She brings in Nymeria and the Hound to finish the job. Nymeria gravely injures Cersei and the Hound combats with the Mountain. Its Arya who finishes Cersei and slits her throat. Nymeria and the Hound destroys the Mountain but he doesnt seem to die. The Mountain loses his helmet at some point and thats when the Hound manages to burn his face with fire. The Mountain is left to die and The Hound, Arya and Nymeria leave The Red Keep.

 The Commanders of the Golden Company have entered the castle and order Varys to hand over Daenerys to them. Varys tell them that Daenerys has died and the Commanders clear Varys out of their way and stab him. They indeed find Daeneryss body and take her body with them to bring it to Queen Cersei. Samwell is able to hide himself together with Missandei and Danys baby. The Golden Company retreat back to Kings Landing.

 Euron Greyjoy arrives back in Kings Landing to find out that Queen Cersei has been slaughtered. He pretends to be saddened by her death.

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark arrive back in Dragonstone to find out that everyone has been slaughtered. Samwell meets him on the stairs with Jons child in his arms. Jon starts to weep.

Also stuff we know will happen such as Jon's reunions, Arya+Gendry Reunion, and Jon learning the truth will not be included. Now that I got that out of the way let's begin:

- NK destroys the rest of the Wall, with it falling on Edd and NW.

- Cersei has a miscarriage and sends Euron, Strickland, and the GC to sack WF for its food.

- Jaime and Bronn arrive in WF with a Army from the Riverlands, Theon also arrives (after his rescue mission backfires)

- Jon ends the relationship with Dany once he finds out the truth

- Howland and Mel in old lady form arrive at WF at some point

- In a twist Arya is actually not happy with Jon bending the knee at first

- The first battle is brutal resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce, Tormund, and most of the Northern Lords.

- Euron with Strickland and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame, Mel fights the NK via magic, she dies due to being weakened

- Euron+GC steal ships Theon and Dany left at White Harbor to sail back to KL, Theon uses the remaining ships to follow them.

- Gendry dies but is given the kiss of life by Beric, Arya heads to KL to deal with Cersei with Gendry going with her (they also admit there feelings for each other at some point sharing a kiss)

- Everyone (except for Arya, Gendry, and Theon) evacuate to Riverlands

- Jaime, Brienne, Bronn, and The Hound go on there own mission to deal with Cersei.

- Boatbaby twins, Dany and Drogon die fighting the NK and Viserion.

- CLEGANEBOWL, the Hound wins but dies not long after too bloodlose, Arya almost kills Cersei but chooses Justice over Vengeance and lets Jaime get the kill.

- Theon fails to save her sister but does sacrifice himself killing Euron to save Arya, Jaime and Brienne sets off the wildfire killing the Wights that have made it into KL. But also kills Bronn, Varys, Qyburn, Damphair, the Little Birds, Strickland, Rhaegal, and any citizens not lucky enough to escape.

- Jon 1v1 the NK in the Gods Eye not before NK kills Howland Reed, Jon is able to neutralize him and with help from Bran and Sam take the piece of Dragonglass in him out of him, killing the NK but making all the Wights (including Viserion) collapse and turning the WWs back to human.

- The throne is melted down and a Proto-Democratic Government is established with Jon elected the new King and raising his children on his own, Sam and Gilly are mad Lord and Lady of the Reach.

- Edmure is made Lord of the Riverlands, Robin remains Lord of the Vale, Sansa Queen in the North (taking Pod as her husband), New houses ruling Dorne, Storm Lands, and Pyke, and Tyrion rules the Westerlands.

- Arya and Gendry together sail to lands more west, Bran leaves beyond the Wall, And Sam writes a Song of Ice and Fire.

Alternate Ending:

- Arya and Gendry are elected the new rulers of Westeros and Jon leaves beyond the wall with Bran taking his children with him.

Okay now for some notes:

- If you are wondering I think we do get a show version of the Forsaken chapter and also the first scene where we meet Howland is in Wintertown

- I didnt include Tormund and Beric making it to WF or how Bronn and Jaime getting the Army because I feel the simplest answer is that Roslin gave them an army made up of Frey soldiers and Riverlands soldiers Loyal to Edmure and I think people are smart enough to know that Tormund and Beric would make it back to WF.

- How I would write Edmure and Meera out of the show is that Howland had her stay in the Neck and maybe she dies off screen from the WWs and also Edmure has also been hiding out in the Neck but he survives the WWs",16,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Many people think that show Stannis was a character assassination, so on this post i'm gonna focus on book Stannis, here we go...

A lot of people really seem to think of Stannis as the perfect candidate for king, while i'm....well... unimpressed

Most of his deffenders often say he is the fairest, most honourable and just man in Westeros, who never wanted power or to be King and sees it only as an obligation... well... i'm not buying that

Remember when he was about to kill an innocent boy to get this throne he doesn't even really want? that was fun

ok, besides, was he really going to be that great a king? aside from the willing\-to\-snuff\-an\-innocent\-life\-for\-what\-is\-right mentallity, what makes you think he would be a good king? he's a good general, sure, but from what i take of his personality, he doesn't seem to be very pragmatic, he seems to be likely to make the same mistakes that Ned has done with the always\-doing\-what\-is\-right way of life

Now i rest my case

I'm having a hard time coming up with an ending to GoT. The writers for the series are really on my ass and while I care more about the books I still need to help them complete the TV series. Because of this conundrum I come to you. I feel like Westworld provides the best possible ending to my TV show since the people of TV are way more demanding then the book people. Also, no one reads books anymore besides nerds and that isn't my target audience for the TV series. Second: I don't know how to end the book series, but at least with this I can end the TV series and satisfy the needy TV people and get them off my ass. Seriously, why do they care more about an ending instead of a GOOD ending? Anyway, I think GoT would be a great setting to be one of your ""parks"" that you own and so the story itself is just a narrative that was created to entertain people. Wouldn't it be something the Cersei Lannister was just a 'guest' and that is why all that shit happened? Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you collaborated or a crossover episode to tie these two stories together.

My Best,

I always think the real ending will add the least amount to the story and will be the most direct but should be surprising. 
_________________________________________________________________________
""Showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss tell EW those conversations included three holy sh moments in particular.""

The first: Stannis Barathon sacrificing his daughter Shireen  which was shown during the shows fifth season.

The second: Hodors mind-bending origin story, which was revealed in Sundays hour. Martin has known the true meaning behind Hodors name since introducing the character in the first novel of the saga, A Game of Thrones.

And the third shocking moment?

 is from the very end, Benioff teased.
__________________________________________________________________________

Other shocking things happened in these last seasons from Littlefingers demise to the Battle of the Bastards ending with Sansa feeding Ramsay to wolves to Oberyn getting his skull smashed or the Septons exploding. But these two were picked and both involve magic/LOL/Three Eyed Raven...so I wonder if the third twist will relate to the two they have chosen to call out:

Because of the required sacrifice to the LOL, Stannis burnt his own daughter. It didn't bring him victory but Mel requested it. The LOL seems to get a pass for wiping out Stannis army but he didn't conjure up anything for this kings blood, no magic demon arrived to kill Ramsay this time. He just left Stannis on his own to be wiped out.

Had Stannis won he would have been a strong friend to Jon, no? He seemed to like Jon very much and would have probably backed him in the war with the White Walkers...so why did the LOL hang him out to dry?

Hodor - this revealed Bran can not only see but can change the past. Not only him presumably but also the Three Eyed Raven, who was hanging out with what may have been the ""last??"" of the Children of the Forest. I found the scene sad but while Hodor was a huge fan favorite, the fact Bran could time travel and effect someone in the past was way more of a shock to me than Hodor dying which is common in GoT. 

I always felt the below facts were very strange:

* The COTF were at war with man and created White Walkers
* The COTF put dragonglass in a man at some point and did it again with Coldhands and allowed him to keep his mind somewhat
* The COTF saved mankind from the White Walkers by fighting with us against a different looking bearded NK and are benevolent to man and against the White Walkers they created

* MOST IMPORTANTLY - ONLY WE THE VIEWERS KNOW THEY MADE THE WHITE WALKERS, NO ONE KNOWS IN WESTEROS AND IT IS NOT PART OF THE LEGEND AND SO LIKELY NO ONE KNEW THEN AND THIS WAS HIDDEN FROM MANKIND...WHO WOULD LIKELY BLAME THE COTF IF THEY KNEW, NO?

* The COTF and man made a pact at some point to protect the trees
* The COTF were hunted to extinction by men
* The COTF are on the wrong side of the wall
* The Wildlings are on the wrong side of the wall with them but didn't seem to have any contact with them
* The COTF used Howland Reed to send Jojen who knew he'd die to get Bran and bring him to them
* The COTF saved Bran but not Jojen and blew him up with a grenade rather than let him turn into a White Walker
* The COTF cave is littered in skulls???

I think mankind was battling the COTF. This is a fact. The White Walkers were a doomsday device created by the COTF when other weapons didn't slow man's advance. I think the COTF never told man where they came from and invented the ""other"" to trick man into thinking there was a ""new threat"" then together with man they could ""unite"".

The concept that the WW are ""out of their control"" is something new, likely a new lie if you will to cover for an old lie that was revealed. Originally I think they used the WW successfully to bring man to the bargaining table, we only went to the COTF for help (see happy cave painting) because we didn't know they made the evil things! 

I see no evidence they ever failed to perform as the COTF intended and while the NK might hate the COTF it might be because he is just a pawn of theirs albeit one they can't completely control. 

I think one of two things happened: 

The Westerosi figured out they made the WW and punished them (and the heroes who fought with the COTF against the WW) by locking them outside the wall. 

OR 

in just true Westerosi fashion the men that left to fight the WW and the COTF were outfoxed and once they fulfilled their mission of pushing the Walkers back were left for dead north of the wall. 

The dark cave with skulls in the north seems like the green children of the forest had been corrupted and bitter after all these years and dealing with men (who GOT has shown to be awful). So my bet is that the COTF will surface once more and a big twist revolving around the NK will reveal him to be honorably revenge driven and the COTF/Three Eyed Raven the guilty party...which will be a real issue for Jon. The NK will want revenge on the COTF and Bran is their three eyed raven...

TLDR

Jon killing Bran out of duty to satisfy the NK (similar to the opening of the show when Bran and Jon watched the execution, see 1:18 on the below) could be a bittersweet ending.

Also I would like to clarify these are MY ideas okay there for not everything needs to be perfect:

- Something happens to Edd and the NW (now weather or not NK destroys the rest of the Wall or they are left alone I am not sure but either way something will happen)

- Cersei has a miscarriage and sends Euron, Strickland, and the GC to sack WF for its food.

- Theon arrives after Jaime and Bronn (after the rescue mission to save his sister backfires)

- Mel in old lady form arrive at WF at some point

- In a twist Arya is actually not happy with Jon bending the knee at first

- The first battle is brutal resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce, Tormund, Bronn, and most of the Northern Lords.

- Euron with Strickland and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame, Mel fights the NK via magic, she dies due to being weakened

- Euron+GC use ships Euron send there prior to sail back to KL, Theon follow them.

- Gendry dies but is given the kiss of life by Beric, Arya heads to KL to deal with Cersei with Gendry going with her (they also admit there feelings for each other at some point sharing a kiss)

- Everyone (except for Arya, Gendry, and Theon) evacuate to Riverlands

- Jaime, Brienne, and The Hound go on there own mission to deal with Cersei.

- BoatBaby twins

- Dany and Drogon die in battle against the NK and Viserion

- Arya is about to kill Cersei but chooses vengeance over Justice letting Jaime get the kill.

- CLEGANEBOWL, the Hound wins but dies not long after to bloodlose

- Jaime sets off the wildfire with Brienne destroying the Wights that have entered the city. But this also results in the deaths of Qyburn, Varys, Harry, Brienne, Rhaegal, and any citizen not lucky enough to escape.

- Varys and Tyrion where taken hostage but escaped thanks to Jaime

- Theon avenges his sister and saves Arya by sacrificing himself killing Euron

- Jon defeats the NK and with help from Bran and Sam removes the Dragonglass in his chest.

- The Wights collapse and WWs turn back to human with the curse lifted from them.

- The throne is melted down and a Proto-Democratic Government is established with election for the new king. Jon is elected the king of the Seven Kingdoms.

- Bran leaves with the now turned human WWs, Sansa is queen of the North, Arya and Gendry sail more west, and Sam lord of the Reach starts writing a song of ice and fire

ALTERNATE ENDING:
- Arya and Gendry are elected king and queen of the seven kingdoms and Jon goes beyond the wall with Bran to raise his twin children away from a life of ruling.

Oh and if your wondering Tyrion is lord of Westerlands, Edmure Lord of the Riverlands, Robin Lord of the Vale, and new houses ruling Stormlands, Pyke, and Maybe Dorne. Also I would write Meera and Edmure out by saying Edmure when to the Neck after escaping the Twins and Meera just stayed in the Neck. Also I did not include Howland Reed because idk if he will appear even know I think it would be cool if he did.",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Stannis, Selyse and Melisandre are having an awkward family dinner, with Selyse chatting about the starvation they had to endure during the siege of Storm's End and how Stannis made her soup from books. She also mentions this tidbit:  ""One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.""

Now, there is a somewhat well-known [anecdote](https://www.riddles.com/archives/2581) about the survivors of a shipwreck who are washed up on a deserted island alongside the dead bodies of all their friends. The only source of food for the survivors are the seagulls who sometimes land on the island, and who are really difficult to catch. One of the survivors is an able hunter though, providing food made from seagulls to the others, who all find it exceptionally tasty. Eventually, they are rescued. Years later, one of the survivors orders a plate of seagull in a restaurant, since it was the best thing he had ever tasted... only, the seagull served by the restaurant doesn't taste like anything what he had on the island, and he has to come to a terrible realization about what the food they ate during that time actually was. (The story is often posed as a riddle such as ""A man walks into a restaurant and orders a plate of seagull, takes 1 bit walks out of the restaurant and kills himself. Why?"")

Does anybody else think Selyse's rather unnecessary comment is meant to be an implication of something similar happening? The theme of cannibalism is not exactly unheard of in GoT and ASOIAF, and it also seems like something Stannis would be able to do out of necessity, but spare his wife from the details. We do know how they had to eat dogs and rats as a last resort before Davos' shipment, it doesn't seem far-fetched that they had to resort to an even more drastic solution, at least for Selyse, who was mentioned to be completely weakened by the end of the siege. I don't recall if there is anything similar in the books, but the episode was actually written by GRRM, and I can definitely imagine him being familiar with this horrific seagull riddle and injecting a reference to it.

What if the Night King is Bran Stark, just as other people theorised, and what if this will mean that in order to defeat the Night King, Bran Stark would have to die (or if the Night King dies, so does Bran). This could be the bitter-sweet ending that I believe would be the best option ( not exactly this scenario, but a bitter-sweet ending has to be the way to end, not a ''Happily ever after'' type of ending ), I also doubt that if this did happen, no one else from the main cast ( the ones that are considered good ; Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion, etc ) would all live as well, here is how I think it could turn out:
- Bran see's in one of his visions (already forgot what they're called, green sight I believe), that he is somehow connected or is fully the Night King.
- Jon fights the Night King, but something interrupts the fight mid-way/near the end, leading to an unfinished battle.
- Jon meets Bran (The directors could do a similar thing as they did with the Tower of Joy - Show half of the scene in one episode ( the fight between Ned and Dayne ) and revealing Jon's true identity in episodes later on) in this scene we could be introduced to a precursor of the Night King, then in the same episode that Jon meets up with Bran we could be shown the truth about Bran), Jon tells Bran that he didn't defeat the Night King, to which Bran responds something along the lines of - ""I know, because I'm here"".
- After all this happens / ends, the Night King is defeated with Bran dying (He either sacrificed himself or Jon fought the Night King again, also the Night King could be the one explaining to Jon that he is Bran during the fight and then Bran 'connects' with the Night King - This scene could happen if Jon and Bran did not meet)
- Later on, after other things/events occur, Daenerys is officially pregnant, time goes by quicker now and we end up with Jon's kid being born and Daenerys dying ( Just like the mother's of all three dragons; Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys did). 
Or alternatively Jon due to the Night King / Golden Company ( Which I believe Naario or whatever his name is, will join when he finds out that Daenerys is with Jon, as he had feelings for her and fight with Jon, killing him ), now we see a time skip when Jon's kid is born, Daenerys dies and Tyrion takes care of him, then another time skip occurs/during the same scene when Tyrion takes him after Daenerys' death and mentions something about his parents being great people and that he will grow up to be like them.
This would be a VERY bitter but somewhat sweet ending. 
More of my theory could be added after I come up with something either ridiculous or something that could make sense.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It seems likely, that the iron throne will be destroyed in the battles for it, maybe even all of Kings Landing. 
Just think about it:
Arya, Cersei, Jamie, Danaerys, Ellaria, Yara, Euron, Melisandre, Bronn, th Mountain and the Hound are ruled out for obvious reasons.
Sansa too, she is definitely out for blood now.
Jon would be way to obvious and clich.
I don't think Theon, Varys or sweet Robin have any real chance. 
That leaves Bran, but I think he will live and fall with the Night King; Brienne, but her story is too twisted with Jamies and I strongly feel like she will end up killing Cersei and become the ""Queen Slayer"" due to the prophecy of the younger and more beautiful queen in the books and Briennes ""nickname"", or having to kill Jamie and maybe commit suicide after that (?); Sam, but he seems more like the narrator of the story, writing how it came, that everything burnt down to ashes; Tyrion, who seems like the only ""real"" candidate left, but I kinda think, he will be way to pissed of of any kind of politics and power games after all this is over.

My question is about Lord Hoster Tully and Tansy.  While on his deathbed he constantly talks to Cat about Tansy, but from Cat's perspective you never know wtf happens with her.  With Lord Beric's outlaws you meet Tansy in one of the villages they go to, but I wasn't able to get any connection to Lord Hoster from what I read.  Did I miss something?  Or is the connection discovered later in the books?  My assumption is that with dead Cat now with Beric's outlaws that she will go to whatever village Tansy was in and learn the answer herself, but I can't help but feel I didn't catch the answer earlier in the 3rd book when we met Tansy.

So we hear Jaime and Cersei talk about the Targaryens marrying brother and sisters to keep bloodlines pure but the show neglects to address the Lannister's history of inbreeding creating the enigma that incest is ""impure"" and ""sinful"" and Jaime and Cersei will be cast into the seventh circle of hell for their relationship. Also let me clarify that I do not support incest - just pointing out Lannister history and faults in Tywin's character that the show skrt skrts around. 

When Cersei tells Tywin of her and Jaime's relationship he is taken aback, aghast, disgusted, his ""legacy is a lie,"" etc etc. BUT, his own children are literally the product of incest! Now, maybe cousin marrying was not seen as incest to these noble families but it definitely would have created some genetic irregularities that created the ""Mad Queen,"" which just isn't talked about enough. Give me a sec to explain. 

Brief History: Tytos Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, has son Tywin Lannister, future Lord of Casterly Rock. Tytos' younger brother, Ser Jason Lannister, has children Damon and Joanna Lannister. Soon after, Tywin Lannister marries Joanna Lannister and the two have three children: Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion. Now, let me check my eyes real quick, because that's cousin marrying at it's finest. So, this is what I cannot wrap my hear around. How can Tywin justify his hypocrisy or even have the authority to judge the nature of his children's relationship when he, himself, had to marry his own cousin. I understand it's because the children were supposed to be Robert's, the line of lineage, Jaime and Cersei weren't married, not the true heirs to the throne, etc, but Tywin's feigned disgust about his children's incestuous relationship really grinded my gears for some reason. 

OK, back to the original point of my post: THE MAD QUEEN. Is Cersei so notoriously insane, temperamental and murderous because of genetic irregularities caused by inbreeding? I did a bit of research on royal lineages and inbreeding throughout royal families in Europe and yup - inbreeding was the main cause of insanity among ancient European monarchs. The show, in my opinion, attributes her insanity to her just being a fiercely protective mother who will do anything to protect her family, but I think there's a lil more going on there. 

To round up, I just wanted to shed a bit of light on the fact that Jaime and Cersei are not nearly the first in their family to have incestuous relations and offspring; Tywin's hypocrisy in failing to acknowledge that his own marriage was incest; and the indisputable fact that Cersei is just like the Mad King because her brain has been warped by years of mixed family bloodlines. Please feel free to share any thoughts; agree, disagree, or both. ",16,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

So basically I think they are gonna use Qyburn's Scorpion. Don't really have much evidence. It seems like they hyped it up and the payoff kinda sucked. They specifically showed that it could hit the dragon, and all they would have to do is make a dragon glass tip, or attach a Valyrian steel weapon to the tip. If they hit him, it should kill him based on what we've seen on the show. It would be a cool way to bring down Viserion.

*""If he \[Tywin\] was so clever, why didn't he take High Garden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.""*

To my mind, this implies that she believes that there is some sort of afterlife in which she'll be meeting up with Tywin. Although I suppose this reference to an afterlife could be sarcastic.

Assuming however that she is talking about some sort of afterlife, somehow I can't imagine that she envisions Tywin going to heaven as she has a low opinion of him and the things he did in life. If anything I would imagine she might see Tywin going to Hell, if Westeros religions allow for anything of that nature.

For season 7 I bought a Now TV Entertainment Pass, which worked well and was cost effective. The only problem I had with it was that the audio was not good quality, and sometimes the video would unexpectedly cut out despite me having a good internet connection. Possibility of returning to this for season 8 if nothing comes of this post. It was also good that they allowed you to watch the show an hour after it aired. This worked well for me, as an episode would air in the US at 9pm \(2am for me \- I live in the UK\) and I would watch it the next day.

I've also bought all the seasons of the show on iTunes, as its nice to have a copy of them in HD permanently. From what I've heard, iTunes used to add episodes of the show almost as soon as they aired, allowing you to watch it in full HD. This doesn't seem to be the case any more. Any chance that they could restore this old policy for the final season?

For those in the US, you've got access to HBO Go and HBO Now. After doing some research, its possible to set up a HBO Now account from overseas through use of a VPN and buying the service using an US iTunes Voucher. Not really keen on doing this.

Any alternatives that anyone has come across?",2,1,False,self,,,,,

It could be possible that Rhaegar tried to talk down Robert and tell him that he loved Lyanna, or worse tell Robert that Lyanna held his child. We know Rhaegar injured Robert before Robert Robert unleashes hell and kills Rhaegar with a blow to the chest. I can see a flashback where Rhaegar injures Robert gaining the advantage and then telling him that Lyanna doesn't love Robert, that Rhaegar married Lyanna and she carries his child. Then Robert rushed with hate regains the advantage and kills Rhaegar.

This would mean that its possible if not likely that Robert knew Jon Snow was the son of Rhaegar/Lyanna when Eddard came back from the south. Then in S1 when Robert and Eddard are talking by Kingsroad, Robert is testing him by asking ""your bastard, what was his mothers name?"". But given Eddards loyalty and honor Robert knew he would never try to reclaim the throne for his dead sisters son.

So i have this theory about tyrion. No he is not a targaeryn for god sake. But according to my theory what if tyrion is the real centre of game of thrones, he is the real player of the game and will win. We all saw him surviving from s1, getting what he wants power, pride, love etc. we saw in the boat scene from s8 finale tyrion has this suspicious look on dany and jons make out. What if he had a pact with cersei to betray dany and jon in the great war. Atlast he is a lannister and his father taught him about the love for family only. So he will betray dany and do what will be best for his family. Its game of thrones and twists are its hobby. So according to this theory lannisters will win this war and tyrion will rule the 7 seven kingdoms

Looks like they either forebode the fates of their Stark masters or share their fates. Ned stark drove a knife into the heart of Sansas dire wolf Lady. Ever since then Sansas heart has been broken, by Joffrey, the Tyrells, Littlefinger and Ramsay. Jon Snow has arguably done the same by bending the knee to Danaerys and handing over allegiance of Winterfell, after Sansa won it from the Boltons. Nymeria was pushed away into exile, followed soon by Arya, and both returned as different people. Grey wind helped Robb win many battles and was killed with him at the red wedding. Shaggydog and Rikon faded out into irrelevance. Summer helped Bran explore his warging abilities and died in the cave defending him, Meera Reed thinks Bran Stark also died there when the three eyed raven emerged. Ghost brought the first evidence of the wights to the Nights Watch, as did Jon Snow to Danaerys and Cersei. Beyond that, what will be the fates of Ghost and Jon Snow?",31,27,False,spoiler,,,,,

&gt;Yes it was big. But not that big enough or impactful as meant by Mance(according to me... ignore me if I am wrong)

&gt;Clearly as the wall is 700 feet high..the fire was not visible to those attacking from south of the Wall. However warged help them to get Signal.
&gt;I thought Mance will fire The Wall or something similar which the watchers on the wall have to give tough fight.

&gt;So according to you all what more writers, GRRM or D&amp;D would have done which can spread the word of fire to all Westeros?

&gt;Also other question comes to my mind that Stannis attacked with his troops of4-5 thousands on Wildlings..but Wildlings army was around 100 thousand.

That would explain why Bloodraven brought him at this specific time and let him shout it and THEN bringing him back to the present. He could've easily prevented it.
The reason behind it would be that bloodraven would know that the best way for Jon snow to survive and then be near the wall was if Ned took him as his son.

I know it's a bit of stretch, but think about it under Ned perspective, you are rushing to see your sister and you hear ""father"" but you see no one and there is nobody in miles, you don't understand but you move on, and then, you discover your dying sister with a child, and you realise that this message (maybe coming from the gods ? he might wonder) was meant for him to be a Father to him.

**Rhaegal** - Team Snow/Daenerys had a great plan to destroy the WW, but Cersei ruined it by attacking Team Snow/Daenerys blindsided. Killed Rhaegal in the battle, but Cersei lost the battle.

**Cersei** - Cersei fucked it up the plan to save Westeros and lost the battle. Jaime is tired of the bitch and regrets being with her all those years. Murdered her by choking her.

**Ice Viserion** - The battle became pretty even between the good guys and the WW, all because of Cersei. Ice Viserion was slaughtering the no-name soldiers in the good side, but Drogon was able to kill off Viserion after a hard fought battle between the two.

**Drogon** - Drogon fought hard against Ice Viserion, injured and crashed to the ground. Night King finished it off by freezing it into ice and it shattered into pieces.

**Daenerys** - Jon Snow was fighting the Night King, and of course Night King was better. Night King was just about to kill off Jon Snow, but Daenerys sacrificed herself to save Jon Snow. She is with her dragons now.

**Night King** - Jon Snow went into mad-rage berserk mode after Daenerys died, it becomes a closer battle with the Night King. Jon Snow took a stab in the abdomen by the Night King, but at the same time, Jon was able to give a lethal strike at the Night King and defeated the Night King.

**Jon Snow** - The Night King is dead, Jon Snow bled out in the battlefield due to his wound.

Some supporting Characters can die here and there, like Brienne and Tormunds die together, The Hound (after defeating the Mountain), and Jorah dies by saving Daenerys.

Arya will live, but she rejoins the faceless men to serve the god of death. Bran went back far into the North, became a tree, he was the old 3-eyed raven all along. Sansa will be the Lady of Winterfell.

There is another event where characters behaved in a way that caused destruction to those they love and themselves I've been wondering if Bran might have been involved in. Rhaegar had a strong belief his son would be the prince that was promised and a strong belief in portents and visions. 

Could a vision have been planted by Bran? Could Bran have convinced him to have Jon, knowing Jon would be needed, and this was what caused him to forego his two prior children and also give Jon the name Aegon? This might also explain how Jon ended up with that name, if Rhaegar was given a prophecy or vision that convinced him the first Aegon was doomed but an Aegon was needed, he might seek out a way to make another. It would explain his and possibly Lyanna's willingness to cause this gigantic war to create a child, a child they were led to believe must be created at all costs...by Bran using the guise of prophecy.

**Now to the meat**

*[Here is a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8iq1a0/renewal_megathread_earthers_martians_belters_we/) when you already know about the series.*

The Expanse is a Science Fiction TV series that aired on Syfy until the 3rd season, which is currently still beeing aired. In most other countries it if found on Netflix. It is an excellent series, getting a [Rotten Tomato score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_expanse/) of 100% with the last season, 95% with the 2nd Season and 76% with the 1st Season, meaning it has really been improving.

The Expanse is based on a book series which [GRRM himself](https://grrm.livejournal.com/457140.html) has promoted.

Unfortunately due to the nature of the Expanse and Syfy apparently not beeing all that compatible with each other Syfy has canceled the show after this 3rd Season. Now us Fans are desperate to have some other company (currently Amazon seems the most likely) provide the support to keep this Series going.

So again, more information on this situation and how you can help can be found in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8iq1a0/renewal_megathread_earthers_martians_belters_we/) reddit post.

You're the new King/Queen of Westeros, now you have to set up your Small Council, who would you pick for each spot? (All picks have to be alive at the time of the series, no picking Aegon the Conqueror.)

Here's mine:

Hand of the King: Davos Seaworth - I know Tyrion will probably be the popular pick here, but I am picking Davos because he is the best diplomat in the series, and I need someone who can manage the... stronger personalities that I am going to put on my Small Council. And Davos' loyalty is almost beyond question. 

Master of Coin: Littlefinger would be the obvious pick here ability-wise, but since I don't want a civil war... Olenna Tyrell. She was the de facto head of the (actual) richest house in Westeros for decades, she can be trusted to keep the country's books balanced. Plus, she would liven up the meetings with her sassy humor.

Master of Whisperers: Varys, obviously. Admittedly, he might not be the most loyal fellow, but since I intend on being a good king, I think I should be relatively free from any plotting.

Master of Laws: Tyrion Lannister - He is fair-minded with an inbuilt sense of justice, but also an intense pragmatism that will make him great at the role. I need to put a Lannister on the Small Council to placate his father, and I will need him to help Olenna lighten the mood in light of my next two picks...

Master of Ships: Stannis Baratheon - Kind of a default pick here, as he smashed the Iron Fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion, and he has the distinct advantage of being the only accomplished naval commander in the country who is not a Greyjoy.

Lord Commander of the Kingsguard: Jon Snow - He's an experienced warrior who's personally killed something like 60 people onscreen in the show, he's no one's fool, and he takes his oaths seriously. I feel safer already.

Grand Maester: OK, so technically the Grand Maester isn't actually picked by the King, but as Bobby B said ""I'm the king, I can do what I want."" I'm going with Maester Aemon, since the only other Maesters we really get to know are Luwin and Pycelle. He's a good advisor and a needed calming factor in a room full of strong personalities.

Queen: Not actually a member of the Small Council, but an important political role nonetheless, I'm going with Margaery Tyrell. She is charming enough to make me seem likable, she has a good head for politics, and so long as I'm nice to her, her grandmother (probably) won't poison me.

I was thinking about Dany and Tyrion talking about succession after Dany if she wins. Dany is concerned since she believes she can't have kids, but Tyrion mentions that there are other ways to pick a successor, like in the Night's Watch.

That made me think about how Westeros could have an elective monarchy. I'm just spitballing, but one way it could work is if each Lord Paramount was given one vote. That's 7, so odd number. So probably no ties. But to try to balance power, I thought it would he interesting if the Lord Paramounts could vote, but not for one another. They have to pick a lesser lord as the subject of their votes. 

However, I was concerned that if a vassal of one the Paramounts were elected, there would be too much pressure on that family so that the Paramount of the land where that person was from would essentially rule. The solution  I thought of to this is that the 7 Lord Paramounts vote for one of the Houses from the Crownlands. That House then rules till the head of house dies, then the Lord Paramounts vote for a new king. This would stop some level of undue influence from the Lord Paramounts while also ensuring that the Lord Paramounts keep a majority of their influence. This is important so they will agree to go along with the plan.  

My plan is far from perfect, but I think it would at least be interesting. Thoughts?

This is a semi cross-post from a thread I also posted to [/r/asoiaf](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/8jip6m/spoilers_main_valyrian_steel_a_fresh_take_on_how/) It is not an exact x-post because for some reason it would not let me link it from that page. 

I reposted here to also get thoughts from others. Thanks!*


So I've been thinking about this for quite some time, and I realize that theorizing about Valyrian Steel is nothing new. However, after searching through both this sub and the ASoIAF wiki, I've found no theory connecting the **exact** same strands of tin-foil as my own; the closest I could find was a 3 year old post on this sub written by [/u/Scrotumbrella Here] (https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2et0j0/no_spoilers_a_metallurgic_look_at_valyrian_steel/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) . 

With that, I thought I might as well throw my helmet into the tourney grounds. 

To start, [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel): 

&gt;Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon and **other elements**

Pretty basic, but I still wanted to highlight and put emphasis on the end. It is an alloy of iron, and is not solely composed of it + carbon. Other minerals can be present and still count as steel. 

An alloy of steel which is already present in our world, is that of steel and silicon (the principle element of obsidian) named [Ferrosilicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrosilicon):

&gt;Ferrosilicon is an alloy of iron and silicon with an average silicon content between 15 and 90 weight percent. It contains a high proportion of iron silicides.

Continuing with that Wikipedia entry, Ferrosilicon seems to mostly be used to help deoxidize steel, not really useful for weapons, however the proof of concept is still there. 

Silicon is, of course, the main content in [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian) . A funny thing about [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) is that it is in the [same group of elements as carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group) ; a fascinating thing about the elements is that:

&gt;The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics 

Therefore, Silicon and Carbon behave relatively the same. 

Silicon + Iron + [coke (for carbon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)) = steel alloy.

To make steel, lets take a quick look at this video from the [Discovery Channel YouTube page](https://youtu.be/i6BIyQJZdTg?t=33s) :

&gt;called the blast furnace, because as the ore and coke flow downward, they are met by a **1600 degree blast of hot air moving at 110,000 cubic feet per minute**

Now, if only there were some way to recreate a blast furnace: oh wait, dragons! So I think that dragonfire was used to replicate the blast furnace needed to create steel. Not a giant stretch, again, but please keep bearing with me.

We know that steel was not new to the people of Essos after a certain point. The Andals are known to have invaded Westeros with steel weapons, and that was how they were able to drive the First Men back past the Neck and keep them in the North. Taken from [Wiki of Ice and Fire](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coming_of_the_Andals) :
 
&gt;They were tall and fair-haired warriors who carried steel weapons and the seven-pointed star of their gods painted on their bodies.

So since the people of Essos were familiar with steel, it should not be a stretch to believe that those people who had giant flame-breathing dragons could use their resources to burn more impurities out of their iron when mixing it with other minerals and materials.

But now we get to the really cool part. The *iron*.

I believe, that more than just the addition of [dragonglass](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass), it was the iron requirements that made Valyrian Steel both hard/impossible to forge, but also corresponded to its absurdly high price - even at the height of the Freehold.

Since the fall of Valyria, the only people known to be able to even work with Valyrian Steel are the people of the Free City of Qohor. Taken from the Wiki article on [Qohor](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qohor) : 
&gt;According to Maester Pol, blood sacrifices are used when the Qohorik rework Valyrian steel.

*Blood*. We know from Melisandre and others throughout the texts that blood is known for its magical properties. What I doubt the people of Planetos would know of is [Hemoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin) : 
&gt;Hemoglobin, abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the **iron-containing** oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates

So now we have a magical liquid, which also contains iron. Iron, of course, being the necessary prerequisite to forging steel. But blood (even gallons of it) wouldn't be enough iron to forge a spoon, let alone a sword. So we need another source of iron on top of this.

[Dragonbone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbone)
&gt;**Dragonbone is black due to its high iron content. It is as strong as other metals, such as steel, yet lighter and more flexible**

So now we have a high iron content material, as strong as forged steel, in quantities enough to be worked with. What would be hot enough to melt dragonbone? Dragonfire. Now with molten dragonbone as the source of material, sprinkle in some dragonglass (i.e. frozen fire) and add in some extra iron-containing and deus ex magica blood, and you have the necessary materials to forge a perfect metal. 

In this way you also have a ""renewable"" resource in dragonbone. Though, with the long lives of dragons, the bone was never in high-enough quantity to be able to make enough Valyrian Steel to equip an entire army, you could at least make enough weapons for the absolute elite. How other smaller houses in Westeros were able to amass the fortunes (or what have you) to trade for a Valyrian Steel weapon is still a mystery. 

However I think that this is how it all came to be.

**TL:DR Dragonbone + blood + dragonglass + regular steel knowledge + dragonfire = Valyrian Steel**",8,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

Every once in a while, I see a post about this scene being problematic because it depicts all these brown people holding up a single white person as if she were a higher being.  They argue (understandably) that it's making a very racist statement.

While the imagery here definitely has problematic racial overtones, I would argue that what lead up to this image was casting decisions that were probably made with the intent of placating the same groups who have complained about it.

In the books, it's made very clear that slavery on Planetos is unlike the Euro-American slave trade in that *any* wayward ship or unprotected waterside town can fall victim to slaver ships. Sure a good portion of the slaves are made up of people from central &amp; eastern Essos who fell victim to the Dothraki, but there would also be many unfortunate drifters, foreign criminals and LOTS of wildlings from hovels on the northeastern Westerosi shores (such as Hardhome) 

On GoT, it seems to me as if the show runners decided that viewers would be offended by, or otherwise, couldn't accept there being slaves of all different skin tones.  I would bet a million dollars that if they had cast the slaves differently, there would have been at least a few articles on sites like Salon.com and The Guardian complaining that the show was attempting to minimize the atrocity of the Euro-American slave trade &amp; it's racial connection by trying to ""de-racialize"" slavery on the show.  I can definitely see them attempting to avoid bad publicity.

Anyway, just looking for some feedback on these thoughts...",29,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

As we all know, the army of the dead has finally arrived, and it wouldn't be exagerated to say our heroes are outnumbered about 5 to 1 but does it really matter? For a difference in numbers to assure victory, the numbers would have to be really high or for both sides to have equal capabilities. Besides the numbers, the army of the dead have infinite stamina, some giants and a dragon, but the living have a big suplly of weapons that can kill umdead with ease, large balistas and two dragons, plus horses and the ability to form strategies. When you take it all into consideration, the undead army doesn't have that much going for it, especially so if we think back to Stanis's victory over the wildlings where he was similarily outnumbered.

BUT. I don't think we have the whole picture just yet. The Night King likely hasn't waited so long to pass the wall and not have a game plan, counting on sheer numbers instead. While a cold war would be favourable for him, I don't think that's what would actually happen in this seroes ending war. Now, think about this: All his enemies are gathered at wintherfell for the final battle, all besides Cersei who will most likely get the Golden Company and head somwhere far away to wait out the war. 

Taking all this into account, this would leave the highest concentration of human, King's landing completely defenseless. As such, I think the army of the dead will be led by a few white walkers while the Night King, Vyserion and the other white walkers would go around them using the storm as cover and bathe King's Landing in blue fire(which I highly doubt has the same propertoes as regular fire since an undead could breath it). Thus, the army in the north will defeat the 100 000 undead with high casualties while winther will rise in the south, The Night King claiming a new army of 1 000 000 soldiers.

I've watched shows like Breaking Bad, The Wire and The Sopranos and those are all good but this show is on another level. 

For example Hodor seemed like a mentally challenged character just there to get Bran from point A to B until you find out about what happened to him why he only says Hodor I was blown away that they had that set up in season 1 and planned that far ahead. 
Then there is the battle of the bastards not only is it the most visually stunning battle I've ever seen on TV but it's so satisfying to see the Boltons pay for their part in the red wedding. 
Next is Arya's development she went from a little girl to a badass that killed Frey and Littlefinger 
And my last point is at the battle between the Dothraki and Lannisters never before have I seen a tense moment where I didn't want either character to die but when Danerys was riding her dragon toward Bron on the Arrow launcher I was scared for both.

So here it goes:
It's theorized that in the books, as Robb and Jon died, they said their wolfs' names and thus warged into them. I've also heard there MAY be a dragon under Winterfell or something. 
In the show, Ned says something right before he dies, only we don't know what it is. What if he's saying the dragon's name, and thus wargs into the dragon? 
Bran later tells Jon of his parentage, and tells him of the dragon under Winterfell, and Jon's Targaryen blood awakens the dragon from some magic-coma. I'm not sure how they'd know the dragon was Ned (probably Bran'a vision or Jon's dragon-connection).
I'm also not sure of the significance of Ned being a dragon, maybe it's just something cool that could happen.

One group feels that the COTF are pretty much served their purpose and are done with the show. They were there for creating Bran/Three Eyed Raven and anything from this part of the story (Jojen, the creation of the NK, White Walkers, COTF) is more or less just going to revolve around Bran and his quest to stop the evil NK that is a mindless force of destruction. The COTF made Bran as a final amends for having made the WW and he will help the savior of mankind to defeat the evil Night King. Then the show will deal with Cersei and the ""game of thrones."" I feel like this group also discounts magic playing into the story too much and probably prefers the Machiavellian mischief. 

The second group I feel is looked on as more tin foily. They think the COTF are not on the side of man and there's more to what's going on with their motives with Bran. The Night King might have a deeper motive than what we assumed as well and the end of the show will deal with his motivation, the COTF history (possible more scenes with them) and resolve a lot of the more magical elements of the show such as Azor Ahai, the Lord of Light, Bran's ""time travel"" etc.

For me personally, I think the recent showing of the COTF in the cave paintings leads me to think they may still factor in, Hodor reveal and with Bran whispering and Ned turning leads me to believe Bran will do something in the past again, the Lord of Light and Stannis downfall and Melissande will also have some kind of reveal or resolution, Weirwood trees, Jojen and his quest to make Bran the Three Eyed Raven and tragic death, the shocking reveal that the COTF made the WW and no one has ever found out (Bran still hasn't mentioned it to anyone), these things all draw my interest and I hope there is connective tissue and some answers if not a neat bow. 

As much as the early part of the show was about Cersei, Littlefinger, Joffrey and political intrigue...post Bran's return I think that aspect has taken a strong hold and for me I hope for payoff from the magical side... 

Just curious which camp most fall into and what aspect of the show they prefer.

Its been a while but I remember watching his video over Cersei, and to be honest the more I learned about her...I kinda started to sympathize with her.

We see her now at the end of season 7, as a cold hearted evil manipulating monster, but throughout the story we see reasons that she turned out the way she did.

Being torn away from Jamie, being married off like just a piece of meat and not an actual human by Tywin, being abused by Robert. Being abused by the high sparrow, being haunted by the prophecy she was told as a child.

One scene that strikes the hardest with me is in season 1, when she is talking to Robert and she asks was there ever a time...that we could have possibly made things work?

It felt like to me that despite being married off to a brute Frat boy (Bobby B) Cersei still tried to make the best of the situation, and tried to fall in love with him, but his obsession with Lyanna made it impossible for her.

Or the scene in which she is talking to Tyrion about how Joffrey is out of control and she believes its karma for committing incest with Jaime. She seems so vulnerable and human in these scenes.

I love that, I love how the villain  gets the explanation for why they are the way they are. Nobody is born evil, its 90% product of their upbringing and Im glad they explain Cerseis well here ",20,46,False,spoiler,,,,,

Anyways, if you were to see the library through Sam's eyes and understand the significance of that place for whatever reason and asked to relay that into the future using a cave wall, I would imagine it would look very similar to what is depictied. The large ""armillary"" sphere would be projecting light... like a sun... the horizontal lines against the wall naturally built in or not... would depict the levels of the Library. I would also imagine that timing is everything in these circumstances and that they were designed to make sense when the time was right. There is also a man who appears to be sitting... maybe in a library? 

Also regarding the importance of the armillary sphere. We see lots of circles, some more complex than others, but we see about three different designs. By combining these circles into an armillary sphere... what would we have? 

The Citadel, from above and depicted in the series itself, is located on a small circular island, surrounded by another circular barrier of land. A circle within a circle... and a bridge of land connecting both land masses crossing between them. From above this could depict some signs we have seen. The importance of The Citadel maybe? And we would have seen it from episode one by the dead bodies formed into that shape. For whatever reason the WW understand the importance of that location. 

Just my thoughts. 

There was also another reddit user u/arg6531 who pointed out the similarity between one cave painting and Jamie Lannister. To me it has to be Jamie. Left handed holding a sword, while there was a clean cut line on his right arm depicting what Jamie is today. Can't be coincidence. The beings that carved and drew on that wall had to have seen into the future. Knowing that, I anticiapte that the main wall in the cave scenes was in fact a depiction of The Citadels library.

The Forgotten Kingdom
Whispered words on withered wings
carrying somber tones into the wind
for no one shall hear them sing
rather spread the barbed truth that stings

Dark wings, dark words
they fear, they sneer, they utter, they mutter
oncoming stares and glares
awaiting the unknown message
with scarce a stutter

Wicked words their way come
wars, wrath, rage, violence
their prayers for refuge and rescue
answered with naught but silence

For cavalier kings fighting for 
just cause
playing for wealth and lavishness
forgetting about their pawns

But when all the land is ravaged
by man and beast both savage
when the game of thrones is won
the number of those to rule shall be none

As they stand in the desecration
and chaos they have churned
and weep rueful tears into the kingdom of ashes
never acquiring what they always yearned

Some get constantly humiliated by their peers for no reason, then die. Some die in really gruesome ways. One guy was constantly humiliated, died in a really gruesome way, and also had his father crucified for good measure. This is that guy's story.
Anyone remember Hizdahr? Anyone at all?

Just as a quick note: this is about show-Hizdahr, and not book-Hizdahr, who may or may not be evil. Also, I don't hate Daenerys at all, so this isn't meant to be an attack on her, even though it does touch on how weak her writing was in Season 5. My only reason in making this is that, even amid all the characters who have died over the course of this show, Hizdahr weirdly stands out to me for the mix of how completely miserable and embarrassing his every scene was, and how totally unfortunate his inevitable end turned out to be. Just one of Season 5's many unmourned casualties, he remains unremembered even in the direst days of our hiatus fan-wanking. With this retrospective, I hope that at least one solitary person will reflect on this guy and his incredibly shitty life.

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT ONE: ""The Shits of the Father,"" in which your dad is horribly crucified**

You, unfortunately, are Hizdahr zo Loraq, a hip young slaver from Meereen, born and raised. The fighting pits were where you spent most of your days. Now, however, someone is besieging your city. Turns out it's that dragon queen everyone is excited about, and she is very unhappy. Probably about the whole slavery thing, which is admittedly a dick move. Well, she took the city alright, and now people are going to be crucified, because of those hundred-plus children who were crucified by the Great Masters earlier. Again, dick move, but your father was one of the few who spoke against it, so he's safe, right?

Nope.

Your father died a long, slow, painful death for a crime he didn't commit, and is now feeding the crows. Turns out that the dragon queen apparently did absolutely no work whatsoever in determining who actually supported the crucifixions, because asking around for five minutes probably would have cleared his name. Oops. You would really like to bury him, but the dragon queen won't let you. You need to go to her and literally beg on your knees to your father's killer if you want his corpse back, presumably so he can go to whatever foreign afterlife your vague, unspecified religion (something to do with Graces?) mandates. Your culture is never really expanded upon, but who cares? None of you are main characters, after all.

Shortly after, you're given the job of going to Yunkai and demanding their surrender to the aforementioned father-killer. Apparently she feels that crucifying someone's dad is the best first step of assuring loyalty. Thanks, I guess?

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT TWO: ""The Shittening,"" in which your loyal advice is rudely ignored**

For some unknown, never-explained motive, you actually are loyal to Daenerys ""Free that slave, put your dad in a grave"" Targaryen, and you do the job she gave you. For some reason. You get to happily strut into the Great Pyramid and tell her that peace with Yunkai is secure. Heck, the Wise Masters are willing to give power over to a council of freed slaves and former slavers who will defer all decisions to Daenerys. Plus, it was at virtually no cost whatsoever! As a testament to your savvy negotiating skills, literally the only thing the Yunkish want is for the fighting pits to reopen. The pits are a bit bloody, of course, but only willing volunteers will have to compete from now on, and the common people love it. So, you secure peace, raise money for the city, and work on that whole ""panem et circenses"" thing. Hooray! ""Can't wait for the gal who killed my father to hear!""

Turns out, she hates this deal. This is one of the worst trade deals, maybe ever. She hates it as hard as someone can hate a deal that is clearly in their favor and requires absolutely no sacrifices on her part. You even bring up that the pitfighters themselves really want to do it again, something that Daenerys' dickhead mercenary friend agrees with, and she still says no. She says that she is a queen, not a politician, and thus never ever needs to compromise ever. While that makes for a badass quote, you sort of assumed there was some overlap between the two. Oh well, guess your hard work was all for nothing.

Not long after, one of Daenerys' followers murders a prisoner, and she decides to execute him publicly. You point out that it would be better to do so without any crowds to see it, for fear of pissing off the freedmen. That dickhead mercenary guy responds by saying he wants you dead, and has been pushing Daenerys to kill you, so you shut up. Right after, Daenerys executes the former slave in front of a huge crowd. Unsurprisingly, everyone in the crowd is completely pissed off and start killing people left and right. Which was the exact thing she was trying to prevent. Oops again, I guess.

Next episode, you argue to her again that she should reopen the fighting pits to prevent war with Yunkai, placate the common people, and give the pit fighters a chance at glory. You also tell her that if she doesn't show that she respects her conquered people's traditions, tensions will flare and more people will die. She refuses, tensions flare up, and more people die not even a minute after.

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT THREE: ""Shit and Sensibility,"" in which you are violently forced into marriage*

Turns out that one of the people who gets killed is that awesome knight Ser Barristan, who died so that Grey Worm could be a boring character and dry hump women to his heart's content (by the way, thanks for that D &amp; D). The queen is pissed, so being the loyal servant you are, you go to give advice on what to about the Harpies. However, when you show up, she has you thrown into a cell with all the other former masters.

Apparently she hasn't gotten any better at the whole ""find out who is innocent or guilty before you execute them""-thing that you discussed with her earlier, because the queen shows up and starts feeding people to her dragons. She flat-out admits that she has no idea if the aforementioned dragon food had anything to do with Barristan dying, but oh well. Guess that whole speech earlier about justice for all was just talk. You try to be brave after watching someone eaten by giant lizards, but basically piss yourself and get left in the dark.

After a good while in captivity fearing for your life, the queen comes back and you beg her to not kill you. Now, though, it seems like she's totally changed her mind. She also tells you that she is marrying you. Apparently you don't get any say in this. So now you're being forced to marry the woman who brutally murdered your father, and whom you know for a fact is willing to have men burned alive and devoured for no reason. Yay? Of course, none of the obvious problems with any of this will ever be brought up, ever.

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT FOUR: ""A Storm of Shits,"" in which you are mocked and die unloved*

So, you're at the fighting pits with your forced-marriage bride. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious that everyone thinks that you're leading the Sons of the Harpy, and all of them hate you, even that drunken dwarf that showed up recently. The dickhead mercenary literally points a knife at your throat not a foot away from Daenerys ""Execute 'em some more, now get in my red door"" Targaryen, and she doesn't say a word about your life being threatened. Hell, she seems happy that he does it!

So she and the mercenary both insult you for saying that a larger, stronger fighter usually wins out over a smaller one, and she belittles you for never having killed someone yourself, despite the only person she ever killed that way being her vegetable ex-husband. Immediately after, the stronger fighter obviously wins, but no one acknowledges that you were right. After that, the dwarf also insults you, and Daenerys strongly implies that she's going to burn down the entire city and everyone living in it. She seems really fond of doing that.

Then, suddenly, disaster strikes. The Sons of the Harpy are attacking! Thinking quickly, you immediately rush to the queen's side and tell her to follow closely - you know a secret way out. Yes, that's right: you were actually loyal the entire time! All of your suggestions and recommendations were actually made completely and totally in good faith, and all of Daenerys and her friends' suspicions were utterly baseless. But now you can show 'em. Finally, at last, you can prove your worth and loyalty, and--

Nope. You're surrounded by four Harpies out of nowhere and stabbed to death. Daenerys and co. don't even bother to check your pulse before they bail, running out into the middle of the pit for some reason. They leave you behind, bleeding to death on the ground.

And so dies Hizdahr zo Loraq. Abandoned by your wife and all her friends, none of whom will ever even mention you again. Seriously, like not even once in the two seasons after. Literally every time you were on-screen you were belittled, insulted, threatened with death, or had someone close to you killed. Not one time did anyone ever acknowledge your point of view or thank you for your opinion, even though you tried your best and were consistently in the right every time, and when they adopted one of your plans three episodes later. You might have thought that you were meant to be the sympathetic voice of this otherwise alien culture, there to be a contrary voice in the next season and demonstrate the need to understand a conquered people in order to rule them. Turns out, it's just going to be 5 or 6 people from Westeros, Naath, or literally anywhere else making decisions on your people's behalf.

In the time since then, throughout each season of the show and the history that has been unfolded we have seen how the great houses made war, schemed and connived, crushed the ""smallfolk"" causing them miserable lives. There are some good rulers, Ned was fair but stern to those under him but from the Mad King to Robert to Tywin to Joffry to the Boltons to even Dorne and Highgarden and Lysa Arryn and her son, these lords and kings generally put their own interests and vendettas above all else and would go to war instantly for their own desires and not the needs of the people.

Now Dany is coming and wants to ""break"" the wheel and cares about those it grinds. Jon is a moral leader who is a somewhat reluctant leader who takes the throne seriously and Sansa seems to have grown into being competent and worries about things like food stocks for her people in the upcoming winter. Tyrion has always seemed to care about the people. Cersei still rules Kings Landing and with the war waging Westeros smallfolk are likely feeling it again as winter comes. 

The real villain/monster is not the Night King (or even the COTF if they do end up in league with him) but the Westerosi warriors that destroy everything in their way going back to the COTF times to the present? If he were coming and Jon/Dany/Tyrion had not emerged the NK would be battling people who were fairly evil...the savage murderers who have failed their people and committed horrific crimes on each other. 

Throughout each successive season we have seen the great houses taken down one by one, the villains were wiped out and it seems like leaders are being forged (by events or design?) who are more capable and empathetic to their people. Had the NK come sooner, he would've found many more enemies worthy of death....",9,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

Some of you may have had a read at my attempt to link Bran to the God's of Planetos, well basically what set me off on that was the way in which Bran gave Arya Catspaw, Bran has become inhuman and his actions now all seem to be solely focused on the Night King. So I assumed that him giving Arya Catspaw was necessary, so that means she must need to have Valyrian steel which signifies to me that she will have a big role to play in the end game or at least the Night King's endgame. So I think that Bran spoke to Jaqen posing as the Many Faced God, he told him to find Arya, get her to Essos, train her and then let her 'escape'. It would tie up the whole plot nicely in my opinion and destroy the gaping plot holes that are there. 

Then in a show/book that loves to foreshadow shit I realised the name of the dagger is CATSPAW or CAT'S PAW. For those of you who have read the books you will be familiar with Cat of the Canals, so Cat's Paw is like saying Arya's weapon in a way. ",8,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Interested to see people's opinions.              

For me:               \*\*Hated at first, grew to love:\*\*                   \*\*\-Jaime:\*\*                  No explanation needed. One of the best characters ever written especially after reading ASOIAF.                     \*\*\-Brienne:\*\*              A lot of people say Brienne made Jaime more likeable, and while that's true people often overlook the fact that they both had an effect on each other. Brienne is a bit of a self righteous, one dimensional, stuck up bitch in the first few seasons. She influenced Jaime by reminding him that even in a complex morally grey world you can still try to do the right thing, while he influenced her by showing her that grey is there to begin with.                    

\*\*\-Tywin:\*\*                    At first I thought ""okay this is the villain"", but by the end of season 1 i'm begging to see him on screen. Not purely good or evil, a chilling reminder that in a scarcity society brutal might be a synonym of wise.           \*\*\-Cersei:\*\*            Insufferable at first, but you see a bit of her perspective as the series progresses. Still an awful person but more of a tragic character than a villain.            

\*\*\-Euron:\*\*                 What little we saw of him in season 6 was attrocious. Every moment he was on screen in season 7 was great. Give us more.          

\*\*Liked at first, grew to hate\*\*             \*\*\-Daenerys:\*\*              Initially I felt bad for her, innocence and purity trapped in a brutal world. But over time I just can't stand her collossal arrogance, hypocrisy, stupidy, and the fact that every victory she wins is 100&amp;#37; due to her monsters, fire resistant powers, or the some guy who wants to sleep with her.                 

 \*\*\-Arya:\*\*                She's like the opposite of Jaime in that I can't believe a character I liked so much a first I despise now. Everything that happened since she set foot in Braavos has been poorly written. She was morally grey in that she's deffinetly been wronged, but she's sometimes hellbent on revenge and kills people who may or may not deserve it. Part of her character is that she has to accept that being small she won't be a great fighter, so she learns to win with stealth, subterfuge, and cloak and dagger. But no, ""let's give her badass ninja skills too, little girls who can kick ass? Audiences love that, ooh she's such a badass go Arya!"" I think i'm alone on this one but I can't wait to see her die.                 

\*\*\-Tyrion\*\*               Not sure what it is but seasons 5 and on his character seemed to change dramatically. He has become very one dimensional compared to the first 4 seasons. His scene with cersei at the end of S7 was the first time I felt like i was seeing the real Tyrion again.             

\*\*\-Ramsay\*\*                 Great at first but he overstayed his welcome, too many scenes were thrown in to force him to seem intimidating. Arrow precision at 500 yards? Check. Can read people from a mile away? Check. Can fight with no shirt and two axes? Check. Just pure cheese for 2 straight seasons, enough is enough.                                

\*\*\-Jorah\*\*           He worships Danny despite multiple signs that she's a worthless leader who's only motivation to rule is that her insane father did.              

\*\*\-Podrick\*\*          He was defined by his reservedness and almost unrealistic loyalty as a squire with some other notable roles to play in the story. He has been reduced to ""look at how much better in every regard a woman is than this incompotent man. He can't cook, he can't fight. Watch her roll her eyes as he fails to fasten her armor. Are you laughing yet?"" He may as well have died after season 4.                    ",35,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Anything you hope gets addressed in the end? 

What did Varys hear in the flames?

What is Varys true motivation?

Why did Jojen Reed take Bran to the/become Three Eyed Raven?

What became of Crasters converted babies?

We spent a lot of time on Theon...show me what you got Theon...not a question but I want to see why we spent so much time...

What is the Mountain now? 

What is going on with Cersei's body?

Why does R'hllor show Melisandre visions that she failed to interpret correctly, where do these visions come from? Stannis was a big waste of her time or it was purposeful...but what is the purpose of R'hllor.

How did the White Walkers turn on the COTF?

Why did Jaqen H'ghar take pity on Arya and why did keeping her name Arya Stark and not becoming ""no one"" satisfy him?

Why must ""all men die"" is it just a statement on the mortality of man or something more?

Why do the Starks warn ""winter is coming?""

Why must ""there always be a Stark in winterfell.""

Why did Rhaegar and Lyanna keep in hiding and let her family think she was taken? I want a little more on what was going on with them other than the wedding and she is bloody in a bed with a baby...

Why name Jon the same name as his dead son, (theories aside) I would like to see that...

Bran changed the past once, is something else changed we don't yet know about, what does Hodor foreshadow if anything?

1178,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-5-23,2018,5,23,6,8ldn5g,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] My predictions for Arya Stark,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/,darrylthedudeWayne,1527023363,"So today I wanted to start doing predictions for each of the characters arcs next season (or atleast what they will be up too), NOT all of them obviously but I will do the ones I am interested in doing, the first one will be about Arya Stark. Now before we get this out of the way I think in order for people to take Arya's character seriously again they need NEED to Retcon the Winterfell plotline into having it be that she was testing Sansa/pushing her to not trusting LF by pretending to act out at her like that (if this is the case though then good).

Now that I got that out of the way let's begin, I believe that Arya's arc next season will not only be about Humanizing and leaving her vengeful ways but also to learn to keep her control as she will have to get use to people coming to WF she may not like. Jaime for obvious reasons, Varys because she did hear her in the Red Keep conspiring with Illyrio, Beric also for obvious reasons, Theon for all the stuff he did to WF Pre-Reek, and Dany. Yes I think she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee, because yes while she loves Jon and will stick by her side she is going to have a problem with him not only giving up the North to someone she only knows as the Mad King's Daughter (I.E the man who killed her Uncle and Grandfather) but also that he is getting help from Cersei forces.

However I think the first person she will have a reunion with in WF is Gendry (whom I think will be the first to arrive into WF). I think they will have a heartwarming reunion which will lead to them Bonding in the crypts, Anyways when Jon arrives she will have a heartfelt reunion with him (maybe Jon will ask if she stick them with the Pointy end) however like I said when she sees Dany she I think she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee and especially to the Mad King' Daughter. Plus on top of that getting Cersei's help with her and Sansa stating Cersei can not be trusted, However she will later realize Jon and Dany are in love (weather it is thanks to Bran or not that is a different story), and also Bran shows Arya and Sansa some of the good things he did for the Slaves of Essos and will grow to like her.

Arya will also have her reunion with the Hound and have to deal with people she does not like (Jaime, Beric, Varys, Theon, and possibly Mel) being in WF. Also I think Jon will confront her about the Bag of faces and what happened between her and Sansa last season and she will explain what she really did and also what she whined through. Anyways when the battle comes up we will see Arya kill a WW and save Gendry from a WW and a Wight Snow Leopard. Gendry will die in her arms and they will admit there feelings for each other. Beric will push her aside and give Gendry the kiss of life bringing him back, and Arya and Gendry share a passionate kiss. 

The two will head to the Riverlands after the battle where Arya reveals she is going to go to KL to kill Cersei once and for all for what she did (if you don't know I think Euron and GC will surprise attack WF and kidnapped some people (Varys, Tyrion, and Sansa) which will drive Arya to do this) Gendry decides to tag along. They run into Jaime, The Hound, Pod, and Brienne who are on a mission themselves send by Jon to deal with Cersei. When they make it to KL they camp outside the city while Gendry and Arya sneak in via the sewers.

I think once there they'll attend Cersei and Euron's wedding to find out what they did to Sansa with Arya sporting a disguise similar to what Lyanna whore on her wedding day (but not to lady like though something that still fits with Arya's character as a warrior). They find out Sansa and Tyrion are still hostages and Varys has turned up missing. Anyways the next day they will go into the red Keep to deal with Cersei while NK battles Jon and Dany in the skies and Euron goes up against Theon &amp; Yara's fleet. Arya sneaks in through the front gates with her FM skills and Jaime, Brienne, Pod, The Hound, and Gendry sneak in through the sewers.

Arya gets the chance to kill Cersei but chooses family over vengeance going to free Sansa &amp; Tyrion and letting Jaime kill Cersei instead. In the end of it all Arya will finally be free of her Vengeful side and decides to either sail to lands more west with some refugees with Gendry by her side or she marries Gendry and becomes Lady of Stormlands.",28,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is an awesome keyboard and mouse combo! I've been using them for about a week now and I love the feel and the sound of the keyboard. The keys have a light but responsive touch to them, they are a bit noisy (if you were to use them in an office setting) but perfect for my home use and gaming.

From a gaming perspective, I generally play FPS or Simulators and so far its worked out great. No complaints from the gaming site.

If I had to give it one critique, it would be that my typos have increased as you barely have to push a key for it to enter it; however, this is more about me learning to type on a mech keyboard rather than dragging my fingers around on a traditional keyboard.

The keyboard and mouse came in a great box that protected them well. The cords on both are about 6ft in length and work perfect for me as I have the tower underneath my desk. If you have your tower away from your desk, you may need an extension for the USB cables.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

The players and I like the idea of the adventure party being hedge knights or knights in the service of some small lord or noble in Westeros. This would allow them to participate in tourneys, bandit hunting, small and large scale battles, diplomacy, exploration-  you name it! There's even the chance to travel to Essos, Sothoryos, and the lands to the far east. 



I'm thinking that the best timeline for this would be after Aegon's Conquest, as tourneys and knights were (in my opinion) at their peak popularity. Had we started in Essos, I would have liked to do it pre-Doom of Valyria, since magic and dragons were everywhere. As for the setting, I was thinking maybe somewhere in The Reach or The Stormlands, because of their proximity to Dorne, which is a favorite among our friends. They also have rich history, as most places do, and very cool climates and landscapes.


That being said, I was hoping you folks could help me out with some possible scenarios. Do you recommend a different region?  What are your favorite minor houses? Any rivalries to use? Any events that take place there, characters to run into, plot elements that could pop up.... that sort of thing. I've never ran a game of D&amp;D before so if you have any experience with that, I'd love some tips. Thanks for your help!",10,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Robb is young, pure and just, spares the innocent, and his bannerman follow him out of respect.                 
Tywin is old, brutal, and harsh, many of his bannerman follow him out of fear.                       
But what led Tywin to become this way? Why is Robb not this way. \[This\]\([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1uEdHna\-ys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1uEdHna-ys)\) scene I believe illustrates Robb's first steps to \*\*becoming Tywin\*\*. The karstarks killed children yes, but more importantly \*they disobeyed Robb's order\*. The one who begs for mercy? \*\*""Hang him last so he can watch"" Robb says.\*\* This is brutality that Tywin would nod and raise his cup to. Listen to the anger in Robb's voice and the rage in his eyes. Some of this is surely out of love for the dead, but this guy is angry at those who disobeyed him. How long until the stab him in his sleep?                 


Tywin is the way he is because in the harsh scarcity world of Ice and Fire, Brutal is often a synonym of Wise. Tywin has learned this through 35 years of ruling millions of men and women. Tywin has learned that brutality produces results, loyalty is good but when it doesn't work fear is all you have. Robb is only now starting to learn this, and he learned it too late.               
I feel this scene illustrates that the primary difference between Tywin and Robb is experience. To quote Tywin himself ""He is so young that he doesn't know enough to be afraid"". If Robb had another 20 years of commanding millions of men and trying to balance their disdain for each other, he would be remember this moment, be paranoid of it happening again. He would be harsh, and firm, threatening, and stop the karstarks before the idea entered their head by any means necissary. Just like Tywin.            ",14,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Prince That Was Promised...was promised to the Night. 

There isnt really a good reason mankind should win this war. Theyve talked about it the whole time about how futile it actually is. So...mankind doesnt win. Instead, the Night King, on the verge of annihilating the world of the living comes to the surviving heroes and demands his prize: The Prince That Was Promised, a child of royal bloodthe true heir to the throne, the prince born to Daenerys Targaryen and Jon to be the new Nights King with the passing of the last. 

Dany will have become pregnant in the new season, seemingly defeating the prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur.  But the witch will have been proven true in the end. As the Nights army surrounds the survivors, the Night King will point to Danys belly and Jon will (with tremendous gnashing of teeth and brooding), plunge his sword into his true love to pull out mankinds salvation the royal baby sacrifice that will Bring Light back to the world, just like when Azor Ahai killed Nissa Nissa to save the world before (and hence never bearing a living child).  Because who says ancient stories cannot be allegories? Do we really believe old Azor Ahai killed all the Nights Army with one awesome sword and saved mankind? Then...why is there still a Nights King? Because the army was never defeated by Azor Ahai, just turned back once they got what they came for. 

It would tie in a lot of the themes of the story Sacrifice and Duty for the greater good as a sign of true leadership, the power of royal blood, the bittersweetness of the whole world, the breaking of the wheel (no more heirs to the throne), mothers dying at childbirth, Night and Light, Death and Life being sides of the same coins, and of course, the importance of PROMISES. 

So, did I ruin the ending for you, or can you change my mind?

However that was not the case as the NK brought down the Wall via the Ice Dragon/Reanimated Viserion. However I was thinking what if that was not what they where forshadowing in that moment in S6?

Because they would not have the NK use the power on the force field around the 3ER tree if it wasn't going to be used again so maybe the NK is saving to use the power again for something more grand.

Before Robin has his tantrum and stomps the snow castle Sansa tells him that:

""My family doesn't live there anymore and SOMEONE BURNED IT DOWN.""

Robin then creepily looks down at it.

Winterfell certainly wasn't burned down, put to the torch sure but not burned down.

With Robin's favorite person... uncle... step-dad...dad(?) now dead is it a stretch to think that he'll have huge ****-fit over it?

We haven't seen Robin in the North but I'm willing to bet he is there camped out with his Knights of the Vale. We know Royce was no fan of LF but I'm willing to bet his sense of honor wouldn't stop him from carrying out his Lord's commands for vengeance by actually burning Winterfell down.

I dont think the Knights of the Vale, specifically Robin, are on the page with Jon and the North vs the Army of the Dead. In Robin's mind he just did the Starks a huge solid by helping them beat the Boltons and for them to kill Petyr will probably leave him with a huge sense of betrayal.

Sorry if my grammar is bad, I've got a bad case of TBI but I had to get this theory out of my head. I haven't seen this theory before after a few days of thinking it over.

During the part where Jon, Tormund, etc are surrounded North of the Wall, Gendry runs back to Eastwatch to send a Raven to Daenerys, there is seemingly not enough time for her to make it in time to save them. Upon rewatching the episode, it clearly shifts from day to night and back again 2 or maybe even 3 times. 

I could see this being enough time passing (with some slight suspension of belief still, Ill admit) for Dany to receive the Raven and fly north. 

The insane time lapse used by the writers to make everything seemed insane to me and to a lot of people I think but noticing this made me feel a little bit better about the execution of such an important part in the show. 

What do you guys think? Im probably not the first to point this out on here but it was pretty big in my opinion. ",32,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

I figured this was a blessing in disguise and that I would just end my show watching career with this, but lately I've been thinking about GoT again and just how fun it was to watch the show. It was the first show I ever really got hooked on like that that I felt was actually good on so many levels.

I'd like to watch the new season when it comes out but... will it be just like the last season? This new refound interest comes because I was really bored one day a few weeks ago and played Crusader Kings 2 because I'd downloaded it on a whim when it was free and never touched it. But after a day or two of playing I found out it had a GoT mod and played that it was really, really fun. 

Since then I've wanted to rewatch the series over and relive the show but then of course I began getting excited at the thought of Season 8, but I'd rather not if that excitement is only going to become disappointment. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Cerseis father was killed by Tyrion, hand to Queen Danaerys. King/warden Snows Stark family was killed by the Lannisters. His grandfather and uncle were killed by the mad king Aerys. The Hound and the Mountain are mortal enemies. Brienne s liege lord Renly was killed by machination of Stannis in which Seaworth played a part. Everyone else that she had sworn to serve (Catelyn, Sansa, Arya) had been harmed by Cersei. Cersei had attempted to kill Tyrion many times. Jon Snow and his sisters had destroyed Cerseis allies , the Boltons and the Freys. Mormonts life was forfeit as a slaver in the eyes of the North.

THE CROWN - House Targaryen (Jon or Daenerys)
THE NORTH - House Stark (Sansa if Jon takes the throne)
THE WESTERLANDS - House Lannister (Tyrion. I think Jaime and Cersei will both die)
THE REACH - Not sure at all, as we don't know if there are other Tyrells still alive. Maybe Sam, as he is a Tarly?
THE STORMLANDS - House Baratheon is extinct. Maybe Jon will legitimize Gendry, but other than that I'm not sure.
THE VALE - House Arryn, under the regency of House Royce
THE RIVERLANDS - House Tully. Edmure is still alive, and has a son with Roselyn. I think he'll be restored as ruler over the Riverlands because House Frey is mostly extinct.
DORNE - Again, not sure, as everybody who could rule it is either dead or imprisoned. Maybe a minor house will take power.
THE IRON ISLANDS - I'd say Yara will be rescued by Theon, Euron will be killed and she will be named Queen.

Targaryens are like the reverse Baratheron. The Baratheon black hair genes are dominant consistently, which led the events in AGOT to happen.

There are significant proof in the World of Ice and Fire also. Every time a targ marry a non-targ, they're children hair favors the non-targ.

I have done one for Arya already and i'll link it if you want to go check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

2. I know some people were not huge fans of the Arya predictions and NO my predictions for Arya is to not try and redeem her because she is my Fav character. I do think she will go to some dark places next season but I don't think it will go too far. Plus there MY predictions not everything needs to be perfect. I only say because I do not plan on changing my predictions anytime soon.

Now let's begin, I'll start with Sansa since my predictions for her are pretty straight forward. With the Death of LF Sansa has finally FINALLY come into her own and is no longer a pawn in someone else's game, I also think this is a chance for the Showrunners to make up for last season by seeing the Stark sisters bound alittle more maybe Sansa even apologizes to Arya for being a pain to her in childhood. With that all said she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee to the Daughter of the Mad king and I think she will question Jon on his actions especially when Jon brings up getting help from Cersei, However Bran will show Arya and Sansa all the good things she did for the Slaves in Essos and see Dany is not that bad and of course she'll grow to like her more.

I also think Sansa will have a reunion with Tyrion and the Hound now weather or not she romantically bonds with one of them is another story (even though I kindof hope not, Especially since there both older then she is). Anyways when the big battle for the Dawn (the first battle anyways) comes around Sansa will be at WF helping everyone evacuate however when Euron, Strickland, and the GC attack she along with Varys and Tyrion get captured and taken to KL. When she is brought to the throne hall for her to be shown to Cersei we get a parallel moment to S2 when Joffrey has on her knees and is about to kill her, except this time around A. It's Cersei instead of Joffrey (obviously) and B. Sansa actually stands up to her and does not kneel but stands tall (also she is not crying).

Anyways afterwards she throws Tyrion and Sansa into the black cells while Varys is thrown into a different cell, Tyrion admits that he made a deal with Cersei and we pretty much finally learn what the cut scene from S7 was between Tyrion and Cersei (though i'll get into that when I do Tyrion) anyways Sansa gives him a motivational speech and Tyrion and Sansa hug. Anyways later Varys is said to be turned up missing and much later Arya comes in and saves her and Tyrion, they hug it out and explain everything that has happened. Sansa is given the North and made Queen of the North.

Okay now for Bran, So Bran one of my Fav characters (which would be shocking because you may think it's Arya but actually no it's Bran...Arya is my second Fav) though that may change alittle due to his behavior last season, but personally I think that is one of the side effects of not only having so much knowledge but also being away 3ER tree for too long and I think that will be explain in S8. Also I think Jaime and Theon will come and apologise to Bran for there actions against him. Bran will forgive both of them as that does not matter anymore (also I would like it if HR showed up but sadly I don't think he will at this point, even though he should).

Bran along with Sam will also tell Jon of his true parentage and then along with Sam and possibly Gilly and Little Sam will leave to the God's Eye prior to the Battle. Once there Bran will get all the knowledge he can about how to defeat the WW's and what they want, why did they return, and what does AA/TPTWP have to do with any of this including a flashback with Rhaegar (either Tourney at Harrenhal, Battle of the Trident, or something completely different we are not expecting). Anyways Jon I think will go to him to the God's Eye where Bran will reveal not only is he Lightbringer as Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP but also the WW's have returned due a combination of a Resurgence in Magic, Jon's birth, Them wanting to end the curse the children put on them, and them being threatened by the TLOL. 

Bran also informs Jon he must embrace his Targ side, He wargs into Rhaegal bringing him to the God's Eye as Jon gets on the Green Dragon. In the end they deal with the NK and Bran leaves Beyond the Wall possibly with some now turned human WW's. ",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In either season 4 or 5 I distinctly remember drogon literally snapping at her, and D along with the other dragons became very distant and less obedient during that time. Not only that, but D literally ran away, and she was forced to chain up her other 2 dragons. It seemed she had completely lost control of them

Then come season 6, and all of the sudden, Drogon is on her side again, saving her from the fighting pit and now once again obedient to her desires. This seemingly causes the other 2 dragons to be obedient as well, and now in season 7 they are following her to Westeros with unwavering loyalty, staying by the side of her fleet the entire time.

Did I miss something? did something happen that caused her to regain control of her dragons? or did Drogon finally just get bored of being wild and decide to go back to his mother?",16,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

With the never ending delays of Winds of Winter, people are coming up with all kind of speculation why Martin can't get it done. But I think we're all missing the most obvious one (at least I've not seen anyone talk about it): economics. The problem is that finishing Winds of Winter is the least valuable thing he can do, speaking of potential revenue. No one is going to buy book 6 if they haven't read book 5 and Martin's total book sales in ASoIaF is, as far as I can tell, around 30 million copies across the entire series. The show, by contrast, was averaging 30 million viewers per episode. And that's not counting torrenting.
So if Martin writes book 6, then he can tap into how ever many people are making up that roughly 30 million book sales (and don't forget that after more than a decade, some of those people have moved on). But if he writes something from the universe (e.g. Fire and Blood) he has some subset of book owners as well as a subset of all the people who know the show (which could be up to 100 million people alone). Same story with spin offs of the series.
So I know it's not something any of us want to hear, but I think that it's a reality we need to face. The 6th book is never coming because there will always be something else he could be doing that will make him more money than book 6 will. And before you say ""but muh legacie!"", he knows he's never going to manage to complete the series no matter what he does, so why work so hard to get one more book when it does nothing for his legacy and doesn't offer the pay off that easier work will?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

You can join. We'll be rewatching S6E10 on Sunday at 18:00 GMT.***

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

**Chat rooms?**

The Chat Team at Reddit are testing Subreddit chat rooms, and this is one of the communities helping out. [Here's their post with more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8g22a6/subreddit_chat_rooms_beta_has_been_released_to/) They're trying to work on involving communities more closely in the creation of features, and because we think chat rooms will be a fun thing for people during the on\-season especially, we're joining in. Chat rooms are still in their early stages with a lot of work to be done  so it's all about feedback at this stage.

**Does this mean bigger changes?**

Not really. It's a fun add\-on, but our focus is still mainly on posts and comments. In addition to the planned group rewatch, we're sure people will come up with other good chat ideas too.

**Do I have to participate/how do I join?**

Some of you will have access to chat already, others won't  it was random. If you're using the redesign and are subbed to the community, you might have noticed the rooms listed under the moderator list on the sidebar. You can join rooms from there. But nobody is forced to use this feature.

We'll leave a comment below if you're looking for an invite to the rooms.

**I have feedback to give  how can I do that?**

You can leave your feedback in this post, or submit your feedback to [r/community\_chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/community_chat) directly.

**How do chat rooms work?**

* If youre whitelisted you can access chat rooms in our sidebar \(redesign only\) or you can open chat \(you will have a chat icon next to your mail icon\) and you will have a new Rooms tab which will allow you to view and join our rooms
* Anyone can be invited to chat rooms, so if you want to be in a room then someone that is in the rooms can send you an invite and youll automatically be whitelisted
* Our subreddit rules still apply  be mature, respectful, and don't post spoilers in the \[No Spoilers\] channel.
* This is only available on web, but a mobile version will be coming in June
* Dont be suprised if rooms appear, disappear, etc. Were working with the admins and in some cases well be bringing down the rooms or recreating them for various reasons that may arise

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

**And this rewatch...**

We do weekly rewatches on our Discord. To test the chat feature, and for some entertainment, we'll be rewatching S6E10, The Winds of Winter, on Sunday at 18:00 GMT \(14:00 ET, 19:00 BST\). [You can click here to check what time it'll be where you are, if you're unsure.](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180603T180000&amp;p1=137&amp;p2=179&amp;p3=213&amp;p4=136&amp;p5=195&amp;p6=176&amp;p7=240)

Whatever method of sourcing the episode you employ, we sync up by pausing on Peter Dinklage's name in the credits and then one of us counting down from 10.

We'd love to see some of you there to rewatch one of the highest\-rated episodes of the show, amid our long, dark off\-season...

Ever since season 7 people have been just bashing and destroying the idea non-stop hating the idea of a flaming sword, While yes I dont think there will be a actual flaming sword per say I dont think we should just throw away the idea of Azor Ahai just yet as it is possible we could still get something like it, and I believe one of the many candidates for Azor Ahai is Gendry. Yes I believe it is possible Gendry could still be Azor Ahai now why do I think this. Well I believe they brought back Gendry for a reason there has to be more to it then just fan serviceoh and also to help Jon in the Wight Mission. I think he was brought back for a reasonThat reason being he is Azor Ahai/The Prince that Was Promised.

Now how does he fit all the requirements? Well he was reborn admits Salt and Smoke from Dragonstone the smoke coming from the fire Mel put his blood in after he leeched him and the salt being the salty water around Dragonstone (the smoke could also refer to him joining the BWB), The Bleeding star is the Red Comet he was most likely under, Lightbringer is Catspaw Ill explain how later, His great grandmother was a Targaryen meaning he has some Dragon Blood, and finally I could not find a strong connection to him and awakening Dragons which is the only thing I have going against him but hopefully hell fulfill that part. Now for Nissa Nissa I think Nissa Nissa is Arya in this case but I think there may be a twist with this. I think the Prophecy was misinterpreted and that in reality Nissa Nissa would bring his beloved a weapon, that weapon being Lightbringer and I think Catspaw is Lightbringer because it was in one of Sams books. I believe at some point the Dagger was enchanted by the Children and it would one day be used to end the WWs. So Arya Gendrys beloved would give him his weapon Catspaw/Lightbringer and he would defeat the NK with it. Now yes the AA will most likely be Jon or Dany but I would love it if Gendry was Azor Ahai.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

A Dream of Spring:

We see all the castles of the realm destroyed by the white walkers and the Night King sitting on the iron throne, Its Brans vision of how Westeros would end up if they dont win this war.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen get married in White Harbor. They claim that it is to make the northern lords accept their alliance more easily, but it really is for love. The nights watch and the wildlings arrive to Winterfell \(they would be useless at Castle Black\) led by Tormund and Beric. They inform Sansa that the wall has fallen. Bran already knew. Jaimie is in his way to Casterly Rock when Bronn finds him and tells him that he is coming too because he doesnt trust Cersei. Qyburn is examining the remains of the Wight when he is informed that the golden company has arrived. He tells Cersei and she commands them to go to the throne room. Cersei pays the golden company. Their commander vows to Cersei that she shall have Daeneryss head and all her allies dead while he tells the story of the Backfires and how they have no love for the Targaryens. He swears that she shall have blood of the dragon. Euron tries to move on Cersei but she refuses him and says the war is not over yet and she is pregnant. Euron is angry, he feels betrayed by Cersei, so he decides to sail back to the iron islands. He returns to Silence and speaks with Yara about why hes done what hes done while he tortures her. He tells her its because he always was the little brother and could hold no real power and that he was frustrated by that but now he finally has real power to do things like torture people if he wants. Dany and Jon arrive at Winterfell in a very similar scene to when Robert and the Lannisters arrive there in the first episode. Some lords are reluctant to bend the knee to Daenerys, but Jon tells them what shes done and convinces them. Sansa is also a bit frustrated but does not object as she understands that survival comes first. Then Jon goes inside with Arya, Sansa and Bran and they have their emotional reunion. Jon goes to the crypts, Dany comes with him, they speak of this war and everyone Jon has lost. Jon tells her about Ned and his brothers Robb and Rickon, he even tells her about Ygritte, Dany tells Jon about Viseryon and Khal Drogo. Finally, they speak about Rhaegar and Lyanna too. Sam is reading the books he stole, he reads the story of the 13th Lord Commander of the Night Watch and the last hero. Jon comes to see him and tells him to come to the great hall, Sam doesnt have time to tell Jon the truth of his parentage. Jon gives orders to prepare Winterfells defenses. Jon and Tyrion talk, in the same place where they first met, about Jons and Danys marriage \(he thinks some lords may see him as a traitor\) and asks Jon if he loves Dany even if he already knows the answer, Jon doesnt respond. Dany has felt some stomach ache and the master of Winterfell tells her she is pregnant. Theon arrives to the Iron islands to find them almost empty. His uncle Aeron is in Pyke. Theon takes him captive. Jaimie arrives at the rock and goes to the dungeons where he finds Edmure Tully. Jaime feeds him and lets him have a bath. Jamie promises that if the Tully army comes with him north \(Cersei controls the Lannister army\) Edmure shall have the Riverlands back and if he doesnt they will all die. He accepts. Sansa and Tyrion reunite and speak of everything that has happened to them. Bran and Sam take Jon to the crypts, so no one hears them and finally tell him the truth. We see The Last Hearth fall.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 2**

I am The Storm.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon is confused by what Sam and Bran just told him and doesnt know what to do with it. Jon goes to talk to Dany and tries to tell her, but she reveals that shes pregnant and Jon cant bring himself to do it. Arya reunites with Gendry and the Hound. Cersei commands the Golden Company to take back the south and orders Qyburn to create more wildfire and ballistae for the dragons. Qyburn informs her that the other experiment is going well. We see a montage of the Golden Company taking back the castles in the south including Dragonstone. Jaimie arrives at Winterfell with Edmure, Bronn and the Tully forces. At first, they dont trust him, but Brienne stands up for him. Jaime gives the Starks Widows Wail to prove that he is trust worthy and he confesses that he throwed Bran out the window and asks forgiveness. Bran forgives him and tells him that if he hadnt pushed him his third eye wouldnt have opened. But the northern lords arent happy about this, one takes out a sword and menaces him but Jon orders him to stop . Jaimie informs them about Cerseis betrayal, Tyrion is disappointed but not surprised, then Varys tells them that Cersei controls the south again. Daenerys is angry and wants to do something about it, but Tyrion and Jon tell her there is nothing she can do. Jon asks Sansa and Arya what to do with the information he has, and they tell him that the honorable thing to do is to tell everyone, but that it may not be the most intelligent thing to do. Sam is reading and finds that there was a Valyrian steel sword forged in Westeros thousands of years ago and tells Bran to go have a look. Bran sees that it is forged using dragon fire, dragon glass and steel. They ask Gendry if he could forge one and Dany if she could provide the fire. They forge the first valerian steel sword in centuries. Jaimie is checking their plans to defend Winterfell with Tyrion when Jon calls everyone to the great hall and tells the truth. Dany angry and confused doesnt want to believe him but Bran tells her things that only she knew, and she has no other option than believe them. Some northern lords are also angry about this and leave Winterfell saying that they wont fight together with Lannisters and Targaryens. Jon says he has no interest on the iron throne, but she leaves flying with Drogon. Rhaegal stays and cries for his mother. Word reaches Winterfell that The Last Heart and Karhold have fallen. They have no other choice than prepare their defenses and hope Dany returns in time. A letter from Cersei also arrives saying that the help is coming but Jaimie doesnt believe it and throws the letter to the fire. Euron Greyjoy arrives at the Iron Islands and finds Theon beside the seastone chair. Theon challenges him to 1v1 combat, at first Euron is reluctant but Theon convinces him asking if he is afraid. They fight in the same place where the kingsmoot took place while a huge storm starts. Its a long fight but finally Theon wins as Euron falls to his death in the ocean, but with his last breath he orders Yara killed and so it happens. Theon cant save her, but he takes the head of the man who killed her. With her dying breath she tells Theon he should be the king of the Iron Islands. Theon gives an epic speech and becomes the king, no longer afraid or weak.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 3**

Winterfell

The army of the dead is seen in the horizon by Jon. The signal is given for everyone to go to their places. 

\-Opening Credits\-

The army of the dead is here, and Daenerys is nowhere to be seen. They chain Rhaegal inside the walls so the night king cant have him. The unsullied and the Dothraki will fight in the open field and the Northmen Will stay close to the walls of Winterfell and the Tully men and Nights watch will man the walls. They all have dragon glass weapons and some even Valyrian steel. The archers will use fire arrows. Grey Worm gives a goodbye kiss to Missandei fearing that he might die. A huge battle begins. There are lots of epic moments: Jaimie and Brienne fighting together, Tormund saving the hound, Arya using her skills to fight white walkers, Jon leading the fight in the field, Grey Worms death, Wight giants, Viseryon burning people, ice spiders as big as hounds Inside the walls of Winterfell Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei, Davos and Varys are watching the battle. They see Grey Worms death and Sansa and Davos try to comfort Missandei. Varys says they are going to lose Tyrion asks how he knows and Varys scared answers *the flames told me, when I was cut.* Sam and Bran are in the crypts of Winterfell and they find a secret passage out of Winterfell where they could all scape if need be, but Bran senses that there is something more down there and that he needs to see it, Sam tells him that they cant because the way is blocked, then Bran tries to use his powers to see but fails. The Army of the dead starts to win and advance, the living are losing. Most of the main characters return to the safety of Winterfell but Jon and Beric Dondarion are surrounded by Wights. The Night King comes down to kill them, it seems that he wants to do it himself. Beric faces him and hits him with a Valeryan steel sword but it shatters, then he grabs a dragon glass dagger from the floor and stabs him, but it also breaks, and the Night King kills him. Jon terrified realizes it wont be so easy to stop him. Rhaegal frees himself comes down to help Jon. Jon escapes in the Dragon but must leave Ghost behind who also dies. In Winterfell everyone is escaping by the secret passage, there is no way to win this fight. But they realize that they wont go far if the dead follow them, so some men must stay behind. The Nights Watch and the Wildlings stay. Jaime decides to stay too and lead them. He says goodbye to Tyrion. Jaimie is all in black except his golden hand which he gives to Brienne, he also asks her if she could fill Jaimies pages on the white book. Brienne objects saying that Jaimie swore an oath to fight beside them, not to die for them and Jaime responds *then Ill have to be an oath breaker to the end of my days.* The tunnel leads them to a hill from which you can see Winterfell in the distance. Tormund says he never imagined dying fighting side by side with crows to Dolorous Edd. He agrees. Jaime dies honorably commanding the watch ant trying to take down as many Wights and Walkers as he can. Eventually the castle falls and is burned by Viseryon, only the crypts remain. Jon arrives to the hill as they all watch Winterfell burn. Sansa is crying, and everyone is in a depressive mood as they start their way down the Kingsroad. Only a few thousand men have survived and are generally very hurt. There is no hope left, the dream of spring has died.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 4**

The Long Night

Melisandre enters the temple of r'hllor in Volantis. She speaks with Kinvara and tells her the great other has returned to bring death upon as all. She asks for a look in the great fire and reinforcements to bring to Westeros. Kinvara agrees. Melisandre looks into the great flames, she looks sad but hopeful \(we dont know what she is seeing\) 

\-Opening Credits\-

Our heroes and whats left of their army march south by the Kingsroad as fast as they can even if they really dont know where to go. Men are deserting and dying every day. Everyone is giving up Jon says that they fought, and they lost but Sansa steps up and tell that no is not the time to mourn, right now they need to survive and defeat the Night King and that the only way to do it is go to Kings Landing and try to make a new alliance with Cersei. Tyrion agrees and they all decide to go to the capital. Qyburn shows Cersei all the ballistae and wildfire, and his new invention. Its a horn that lets him control the Wight, he makes a demonstration with the remains. Word reaches them that Winterfell has fallen. Cersei smiles. Theon hears of the fall of Winterfell and decides to sail to kings landing, he thinks that if there is another battle against the dead it will be there. Jon and company find Dany and Drogon in their way south, at first, they are angry because she left but then they notice she is full of blood. Dany tells Jon shes had a miscarriage and that she is sorry she couldnt fight. Jon is sad and hugs her and tells it doesnt matter and that he loves her now and always even if they both are Targaryens. Jon bends the knee before her even if he already did that to probe her that he is not interested in the throne. Along the way Bran says he must go to the isle of faces, that he must see. Sam and a little escort bring him there. Sam and Bran find children of the forest in the isle the only ones left. Bran enters a vision. He sees the last hero or azor ahai \(who is the thirteenth lord commander of the night watch, there would have been 12 commanders already during the long night but they all died and now are white walkers\) forge lightbringer plunging the sword to his wifes hearth, he sees him kill the previous leader of the white walkers, the one created by the children of the forest. But before dying they turn his wife into a walker. The Hero doesnt know this. He joins the watch to hunt down the remaining Others. One day beyond the wall he finds a woman with eyes as cold as ice. Its his wife Nissa Nissa. They make love and he brings her to The Nightfort. He becomes the Nights King slowly turning into a walker. He makes sacrifices to her, so she can create more White Walkers. Eventually the king on the north and the king beyond the wall unite forces to defeat him. He is exiled to the far north \(the king in the north was his brother so he spared his life\) and she is taken captive by the king in the north. He completes his transformation to a White Walker but is weak. With time and the cold he gets back his power \(some 8 thousand years\). Bran also sees the Night King walking through the crypts of Winterfell, he enters to the section that was blocked and starts going deeper. Finally, he finds the nights queen, his wife but she dyes just in front of him because of the heat of Winterfells hot springs. He arrived late and now is full of rage and grief. At the end the villain was just the hero of the other side trying to get his wife back but now he wants revenge and to destroy this entire continent. Bran realizes that he should have seen this before and he could have prevented this war from happening just giving his wife back to him but now is too late and they are all doomed because winter is coming to get them. Bran and Sam stay in the isle because Bran says he is of more help here than in any other place because the Weirwoods augment his powers. The children of the forest start praying all around him to make him even more powerful. Jon thanks Rhaegal for saving him and bonds with him a little more, Dany tells Jon to mount him Jon does and so he is flying again but this time he has control over the dragon. Jon comes down and reflects about that the dragon is named after his father. This still confuses Jon as he doesnt seem to know who he is. They arrive to Kings Landing \(Jon and Dany in dragon back, Cersei sees them from the map area\) and ask for an audience with Cersei. Cersei sits high above them all while they step in the throne room. Cersei is surprised that they survived and welcomes them. She is upset that Sansa and Arya al also with them and calls them wolf whores. They make a new alliance, Cersei easily cooperates, the Golden Company will fight beside them, and theyll have all her recourses available, and tells them of the horn Qyburn has created. She tells them that earlier Theon Greyjoy and the iron born had arrived. They see the iron fleet and talk with Theon. After all the rest have left Theon thanks Jon about the council he gave him at the end of season 7 and says to Jon that he can be a Targaryen and a Stark. Jon smiles and leaves. Brienne fills Jaimies pages in the white book.  Tyrion and Cersei speak, she hears about Jaimies death, they drink some wine for him. Varys speaks with a little bird, and questions him about Cersei and Qyburn. He promises him sweets and tells him to stay hidden that if they win this war he will need his help. Everyone gathers in the room of the small council sessions and prepare their plans to defend the city. Tyrion suggests placing wildfire pots in the surroundings of the city, so they can burn the Wights when they arrive. They will place ballistae in the walls, with dragon glass tips. The ironmen will shoot them from the ships. Garrison of men will be prepared to step into the field once the wildfire has exploded. Some of them will even ride elephants. Jon and Daenerys will fight from the air with dragons. They receive a raven from Bran saying that he will stay in the isle \(yes, Sam brought birds to the isle\). Cersei has a secret meeting with the commander of the golden company and tells him once the death are defeated he wants them to turn against Jon and Dany and kill everyone in their side except her brother, he has some objections, but Cersei reminds him that his word is as good as gold and offers to pay double. He accepts. Varyss little bird has heard this conversation and tells the eunuch. Jon and Dany have epic RED KEEP SEX \(?\).  The army of the dead kills everyone in White Harbor, The Eyrie \(They put a spear trough sweet Robin\), Riverrun, Harrenhal, Casterly Rock, Dragonstone And they finally arrive at Kings Landing.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 5**

The Great War

\-Opening Credits showing everything destroyed and frozen\-

A huge snowstorm starts in Kings Landing as the army of the dead approaches. Everyone is at their positions. Cersei locks herself the same in the tower where she was during Blackwater, Sansa, Tyrion and other characters who arent involved in the fighting \(the mountain is protecting them outside\). Cersei has poison to die if need be like she did back in season 2. 

The first one to arrive is the Night King in his dragon. The great horn is placed and ready to be used. Qyburn uses the horn himself because of how proud he is of it. It makes a very loud sound and for a moment the dragon stops, but then it burns Qyburn and everyone around there with its blue flames. Jon and Dany go into their dragons, a dance of dragons starts in the sky ant the city begins to burn. The Wights are arriving, and the wildfire trap is activated. Bronn shoots the arrow as he did in blackwater. The hound looks away. The trap kills a lot of Wights and is very useful, but the walkers are coming and extinguishing the flames. Fire arrows start to rain on them from the ships and the walls. The garrison comes out from the gate. They are led by the commander of the golden company in an elephant. Arya, Davos and Gendry ride with them \(Brienne stays behind to look after Sansa\). A brutal fight starts, the biggest battle ever in game of thrones with thousands of fighters and 3 dragons. Bran wargs into Nymeria and leads her wolf pack down to the battle. There are lots of epic and tense moments... Gendry charges to a white walker with his Warhammer like Robert did in the trident against Rhaegar, the elephants charge giants and spiders, Arya uses the face of a Wight to get close to a walker and kill him, the battle field is full of flames of three different colors \(orange, blue, and green\)  Even if they fight valiantly the Wights are too many so they start winning again, Arya is trapped, Davos is against bad odds, the iron fleet is burning and then over the horizon appear a fleet of red ships. From those ships fighters all in red wielding fiery weapons start to land ashore. They are the fiery hand. They save Davos and Arya and all the rest. Arya sees Melisandre and she nods to her. Davos goes to speak with her. She says she must speak with Jon. Davos angrily accompanies her to the city. Davos leaves her there and tells her Jon is in the dragon. Melisandre encounters Varys. She tells him to help her get to Jon. In the sky the battle between the dragons is fierce. Eventually Rhaegal dies and Jon falls. Dany is sad, but she also rapidly burns the dragons body, so it cant be turned. The dead enter the city, even with the fiery hand is hasnt been enough to stop them. The streets are burning and most of the fighting is happening on them. Jon is in middle of the fight trying to make his way to the ballistae and try to shoot Vyserion. Jon encounters Varys and Melisandre in the way. She tells Jon in a cryptic fashion that he needs to kill the woman he loves to forge lightbringer and bring the dawn. Jon doesnt immediately understand her but thanks her for the information and follows his way. Cersei is having contraption, her child is about to be born, so she rushes into her chambers and asks for some servants to help her with the child. He orders the mountain to stay behind and watch that no one comes close. The Hound has had too much of the fire and returns to the keep only to find The Mountain inside. The Hound tries to tell him that right now he doesnt want to fight but The Mountain attacks anyway, then the hound realizes that his brothers eyes are blue as a Wights \(The Mountain has been undead all this time, as an artificial Wight created by Qyburn, and now the White Walkers control him\). They fight in the room with the map of Westeros painted in it. The Mountain is wining and throws The Hounds Valyrian steel sword away. The Hound has no choice but to face his fears and kill his brother with fire. Bran is in using his powers to help in the fight when a white walker arrives at the isle of faces. The Wights cant enter because of the magic, but its not powerful enough to kill the walker. The walker kills the guards protecting them and Sam must face him alone wielding Hearts Bane. Sam is scared but wins the duel saving Bran. In the middle of the fighting Jon tries to reach the ballistae, but in the way he encounters Ghost as a Wight. Jon fights against him but the direwolf is wining. Arya comes to the rescue and helps Jon fight him. Jon kills him with Longclaw. Arya goes back to the battle riding her direwolf Nymeria. There would be some more epic fighting. The tower where Brienne, Sansa and Podrick are starts to burn. They get out, but they are ambushed by Wights and a walker. Brienne and Pod fight side by side protecting Sansa \(and Tyrion\). Podrick dies having killed the walker. Brienne and Sansa seek refuge in a common home. Tyrion sees all the destruction and goes to the cellar to get drunk . Jon gets to the Ballistae. He shots and fails 2 times. When he is about to shoot the third time Dany uses Drogon to stop Viseryon from moving. Jon has a clear shot, but it would mean kill Drogon too. Dany tells him to do it, so Jon does it and kills both dragons. They start to fall. Drogon and Dany fall to the throne room behind the iron throne and the night king and Vyserion just outside the throne room. Jon gets to the throne room too by a side door and goes to Danys side. The throne room is burned and full of snow just as it was in the vision in season 2. The night king enters and is ready to fight. Jon realizes the meaning of Melisandres words and knows what he must do. With a tear in his eye he looks at Daenerys and stabs Longclaw right through her chest. She falls on to the iron throne and she starts dying seated on it. Longclaw bursts into flames and an epic final confrontation takes place between Jon and the Night King. A true song of ice and fire. The night king is better than Jon and Bran sees this, so he tries to enter the night kings mind. Inside his head the night king and bran have a psychic battle. Its really tens but Bran slows him down enough for Jon to land a fatal blow. We would see all the Wights and white walkers die. Jon is wounded and bleeding, he walks to Daenerys and touches her hand and tells her hi is sorry. She smiles and dies. Jon still bleeding walks outside the room and falls to the ground. Having accomplished his purpose Jon dies for real in the steps of the red keep seeing the sun for the first time this season while the stark theme plays in the background. Melisandre also sees the sun, takes out her collar and steps into the flames \(Davos sees this in the distance while he holds the burned stag on his hand\). The last shot of the episode would be Jon dead in the same position than in the finale of season 5. The great war is over, and the dawn has finally come.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 6**

A Song of Ice and Fire

\-Opening Credits\-

The episode starts with all the wights and Walkers dying and everyone looking relieved as the sum comes out. But then the golden company start killing Cerseis enemies \(the northern army\). Arya sees this and kills the commander of the golden company. Arya asks him why they did this, and he responds it were Cerseis orders and that they never break their contract. Arya wears his face and orders the fight to stop. She goes see Cersei with the face. She finds Cersei bleeding and suffering on her bed. Cersei is clearly dying so Arya doesnt kill her. Cersei asks Arya to find Tyrion and bring him. Arya finds Tyrion in the cellar very drunk and tells him the battle is over they have won and that his sister wants to see him. Tyrion arrives at Cerseis chambers. Cersei is dying of childbirth, shes had a dwarf son and is dying of it like their mother. Cersei laughs at the irony. She apologizes for all the horrible things shes done to her dwarf brother and asks him to rise the child. She tells him to take The Rock and rise the child there. Cersei names the child Tywin and says *promise me Tyrion* as she dies. Tyrion takes the baby and goes to the throne room. Every main character that has survived is there. They are sad about Jon and Dany. They say some words for them and discuss what to do now. Tyrion says that they must hold a great council with all the lords and ladies that have survived. The council will be at Oldtown because it hasnt suffered much on the wars and the maesters are there. Everyone leaves the throne room. Arya goes to a room alone and cries for Jon, the hound finds her and comforts her. Tyrion finds 3 dragon eggs beside Drogons body, but he decides to throw them in the ocean where no one can find them, Bronn asks him why he did that, Tyrion tells him the dragons have done much more harm than good. Bran and Sam also see the sun rise from the isle, Bran tells Sam there is one more thing he wants to do before leaving the island. Bran goes into a vision and sees the black cells with Eddard lying there, Bran speaks with his father and thanks to the additional power he has in the island Ned can see him. Ned asks if everything is well. Bran doubts a moment and the answer*s y*es, Ned nods and says that then he has nothing to worry about. The guards come to take him. Sometime later everyone is in Oldtown for the great council. All the lords, great and small are there. The maesters inform that it will start in an hour. Everyone is meeting each other when Tyrion asks to speak with Varys privately, only Bronn comes with them.  Tyrion offers Varys wine and he refuses, but Tyrion tells him to drink. Varys reluctantly does so. Tyrion asks Varys why and revels he knows the spiders plan to kill everyone in the meeting. Tyrion spoke with the little birds in Kings Landing. He is sad and disappointed. Varys tells Tyrion that the flames told him that when the long night comes if the right king or queen doesnt sit the Iron Throne they would all be doomed \(with more poetic words\). He tells Tyrion about all his failed attempts at that. He says he really does care about the people of the realm and so tough the best monarch would be same one who did the best for them. With all his failed attempts he started to grow frustrated and started wondering how it would feel to sit in that throne. He never had the chance to try to climb those steps until now. Tyrion asks is he would also have killed him. Varys says it was nothing personal. Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Varys and he does it. The meeting starts, and all the lords start discussing who the next king should be, who has the best claim. The discussion grows really tense until Tyrion says he trusted Daenerys because she was the queen he chose. Tyrion suggest that a council may be hold every 5 years to elect the new king or queen. Every lord great and small might have a vote and anyone has a chance to be king. The only thing they would need to do is step up and tell what their plans for the realm are. A great king could rule all his life wile a mad one would only last 5 years. They also would set some laws that even the king must obey. They decide the first king election will be hold in 5 years, until then the maesters will have the regency while the lords focus on rebuilding and repopulating.  Then they discuss the situation of the north and the iron islands. They are offered the chance to be independent kingdoms but Sansa refuses because she sees that thing will be done better now in Westeros. Theon does the same following Sansas example. They are granted the honorary titles of queen in the North and king of the Iron Islands to preserve peace in the future. The empty castles are given to new and old lords. Gendry is legitimized and given Storms End, Bronn is given the twins, Edmure is given Riverrun back, Sam Hornhill, Tyrion the rock Bran says that the nights watch must be reformed in the case that the death come back again. Jorah Mormont offers to rebuild the watch and become the 1000th lord commander. Tyrion says that the iron thrones must be destroyed, and a more comfortable throne must be built to replace it. The great council ends. Daenerys and the iron throne are burnt together while Jon is being burned in the north \(in the ruins of Winterfell\) like the men of the watch and the wildlings did. Tyrion and Bronn are in their way to their castles. Tyrion gives Bronn a really big sack of gold and tells him he will change the wealth of house Lannister from gold to wine. Everyone arrives at their seats. The hound becomes a monk with a vow of silence finally finding peace. Davos will return to the sea. He will bring Missandei to her homeland of Naath. Up at the wall the Stark sisters say goodbye to Bran who must go beyond\-the\-wall to watch the death as the new 3 eyed raven. He says that maybe the dead never return but that he must go and watch. Jorah says that if Westeros is changing the watch must change too. From no on you wont take the black for life but you will serve some years and at the end of your time you shall be recompensed. The Starks sisters and Brienne walk through the ruined Winterfell that is being rebuilt. Brienne wants to be Sansas first Queenguard, to which she responds that she is no true queen. Brienne answers that she is no true knight, Sansa smiles and makes Brienne her queenguard. Sansa asks Arya what she will do now, she suggests that she could give her, a castle. Arya says no, that is not her. She asks Sansa what is west of Westeros and tells her she will find out but promises to return some day. Before she leaves Sansa has a final thing to show her. They go down to the crypts, the only part left intact. Sansa had ordered a statue of the whole Stark family made. Everyone is there: Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Rickon, Bran, Sansa, Arya and even Jon. Cut to black.

Some years later we are at Hornhill. In the yards there is a singer singing a song about Jon and Dany defeating the night king. Gilly and little Sam are in the yard dancing happily. Sam looks down from a window and smiles. Then he finishes his book about The Great War and we see that he names it *A Song Of Ice And Fire*.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have done one for Arya already and i'll link it if you want to go check it out 
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

Secondly I know some people were not huge fans of the Arya predictions and NO my predictions for Arya is to not try and redeem her because she is my Fav character. I do think she will go to some dark places next season but I don't think it will go too far. Plus there MY predictions not everything needs to be perfect. I only say because I do not plan on changing my predictions anytime soon.

Now let's begin, I'll start with Sansa since my predictions for her are pretty straight forward. With the Death of LF Sansa has finally FINALLY come into her own and is no longer a pawn in someone else's game, I also think this is a chance for the Showrunners to make up for last season by seeing the Stark sisters bound alittle more maybe Sansa even apologizes to Arya for being a pain to her in childhood. With that all said she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee to the Daughter of the Mad king and I think she will question Jon on his actions especially when Jon brings up getting help from Cersei, However Bran will show Arya and Sansa all the good things she did for the Slaves in Essos and see Dany is not that bad and of course she'll grow to like her more.

I also think Sansa will have a reunion with Tyrion and the Hound now weather or not she romantically bonds with one of them is another story (even though I kindof hope not, Especially since there both older then she is). Anyways when the big battle for the Dawn (the first battle anyways) comes around Sansa will be at WF helping everyone evacuate however when Euron, Strickland, and the GC attack she along with Varys and Tyrion get captured and taken to KL. When she is brought to the throne hall for her to be shown to Cersei we get a parallel moment to S2 when Joffrey has on her knees and is about to kill her, except this time around A. It's Cersei instead of Joffrey (obviously) and B. Sansa actually stands up to her and does not kneel but stands tall (also she is not crying).

Anyways afterwards she throws Tyrion and Sansa into the black cells while Varys is thrown into a different cell, Tyrion admits that he made a deal with Cersei and we pretty much finally learn what the cut scene from S7 was between Tyrion and Cersei (though i'll get into that when I do Tyrion) anyways Sansa gives him a motivational speech and Tyrion and Sansa hug. Anyways later Varys is said to be turned up missing and much later Arya comes in and saves her and Tyrion, they hug it out and explain everything that has happened. Sansa is given the North and made Queen of the North.

Okay now for Bran, So Bran one of my Fav characters (which would be shocking because you may think it's Arya but actually no it's Bran...Arya is my second Fav) though that may change alittle due to his behavior last season, but personally I think that is one of the side effects of not only having so much knowledge but also being away 3ER tree for too long and I think that will be explain in S8. Also I think Jaime and Theon will come and apologise to Bran for there actions against him. Bran will forgive both of them as that does not matter anymore (also I would like it if HR showed up but sadly I don't think he will at this point, even though he should).

Bran along with Sam will also tell Jon of his true parentage and then along with Sam and possibly Gilly and Little Sam will leave to the God's Eye prior to the Battle. Once there Bran will get all the knowledge he can about how to defeat the WW's and what they want, why did they return, and what does AA/TPTWP have to do with any of this including a flashback with Rhaegar (either Tourney at Harrenhal, Battle of the Trident, or something completely different we are not expecting). Anyways Jon I think will go to him to the God's Eye where Bran will reveal not only is he Lightbringer as Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP but also the WW's have returned due a combination of a Resurgence in Magic, Jon's birth, Them wanting to end the curse the children put on them, and them being threatened by the TLOL. 

Bran also informs Jon he must embrace his Targ side, He wargs into Rhaegal bringing him to the God's Eye as Jon gets on Rhaegal. In the end they deal with the NK and Bran leaves Beyond the Wall possibly with some now turned human WW's. ",9,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

A Dream of Spring:

We see all the castles of the realm destroyed by the white walkers and the Night King sitting on the iron throne, Its Brans vision of how Westeros would end up if they dont win this war.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen get married in White Harbor. They claim that it is to make the northern lords accept their alliance more easily, but it really is for love. The nights watch and the wildlings arrive to Winterfell \(they would be useless at Castle Black\) led by Tormund and Beric. They inform Sansa that the wall has fallen. Bran already knew. Jaimie is in his way to Casterly Rock when Bronn finds him and tells him that he is coming too because he doesnt trust Cersei. Qyburn is examining the remains of the Wight when he is informed that the golden company has arrived. He tells Cersei and she commands them to go to the throne room. Cersei pays the golden company. Their commander vows to Cersei that she shall have Daeneryss head and all her allies dead while he tells the story of the Backfires and how they have no love for the Targaryens. He swears that she shall have blood of the dragon. Euron tries to move on Cersei but she refuses him and says the war is not over yet and she is pregnant. Euron is angry, he feels betrayed by Cersei, so he decides to sail back to the iron islands. He returns to Silence and speaks with Yara about why hes done what hes done while he tortures her. He tells her its because he always was the little brother and could hold no real power and that he was frustrated by that but now he finally has real power to do things like torture people if he wants. Dany and Jon arrive at Winterfell in a very similar scene to when Robert and the Lannisters arrive there in the first episode. Some lords are reluctant to bend the knee to Daenerys, but Jon tells them what shes done and convinces them. Sansa is also a bit frustrated but does not object as she understands that survival comes first. Then Jon goes inside with Arya, Sansa and Bran and they have their emotional reunion. Jon goes to the crypts, Dany comes with him, they speak of this war and everyone Jon has lost.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 2**

I am The Storm.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon is confused by what Sam and Bran just told him and doesnt know what to do with it. Jon goes to talk to Dany and tries to tell her, but she reveals that shes pregnant and Jon cant bring himself to do it. Arya reunites with Gendry and the Hound. Cersei commands the Golden Company to take back the south and orders Qyburn to create more wildfire and ballistae for the dragons. Qyburn informs her that the other experiment is going well. We see a montage of the Golden Company taking back the castles in the south including Dragonstone. Jaimie arrives at Winterfell with Edmure, Bronn and the Tully forces. At first, they dont trust him, but Brienne stands up for him. Jaime gives the Starks Widows Wail to prove that he is trust worthy and he confesses that he throwed Bran out the window and asks forgiveness. Bran forgives him and tells him that if he hadnt pushed him his third eye wouldnt have opened. But the northern lords arent happy about this, one takes out a sword and menaces him but Jon orders him to stop . Jaimie informs them about Cerseis betrayal, Tyrion is disappointed but not surprised, then Varys tells them that Cersei controls the south again. Daenerys is angry and wants to do something about it, but Tyrion and Jon tell her there is nothing she can do. Jon asks Sansa and Arya what to do with the information he has, and they tell him that the honorable thing to do is to tell everyone, but that it may not be the most intelligent thing to do. Sam is reading and finds that there was a Valyrian steel sword forged in Westeros thousands of years ago and tells Bran to go have a look. Bran sees that it is forged using dragon fire, dragon glass and steel. They ask Gendry if he could forge one and Dany if she could provide the fire. They forge the first valerian steel sword in centuries. Jaimie is checking their plans to defend Winterfell with Tyrion when Jon calls everyone to the great hall and tells the truth. Dany angry and confused doesnt want to believe him but Bran tells her things that only she knew, and she has no other option than believe them. Some northern lords are also angry about this and leave Winterfell saying that they wont fight together with Lannisters and Targaryens. Jon says he has no interest on the iron throne, but she leaves flying with Drogon. Rhaegal stays and cries for his mother. Word reaches Winterfell that The Last Heart and Karhold have fallen. They have no other choice than prepare their defenses and hope Dany returns in time. A letter from Cersei also arrives saying that the help is coming but Jaimie doesnt believe it and throws the letter to the fire. Euron Greyjoy arrives at the Iron Islands and finds Theon beside the seastone chair. Theon challenges him to 1v1 combat, at first Euron is reluctant but Theon convinces him asking if he is afraid. They fight in the same place where the kingsmoot took place while a huge storm starts. Its a long fight but finally Theon wins as Euron falls to his death in the ocean, but with his last breath he orders Yara killed and so it happens. Theon cant save her, but he takes the head of the man who killed her. With her dying breath she tells Theon he should be the king of the Iron Islands. Theon gives an epic speech and becomes the king, no longer afraid or weak.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 3**

Winterfell

The army of the dead is seen in the horizon by Jon. The signal is given for everyone to go to their places. 

\-Opening Credits\-

The army of the dead is here, and Daenerys is nowhere to be seen. They chain Rhaegal inside the walls so the night king cant have him. The unsullied and the Dothraki will fight in the open field and the Northmen Will stay close to the walls of Winterfell and the Tully men and Nights watch will man the walls. They all have dragon glass weapons and some even Valyrian steel. The archers will use fire arrows. Grey Worm gives a goodbye kiss to Missandei fearing that he might die. A huge battle begins. There are lots of epic moments: Jaimie and Brienne fighting together, Tormund saving the hound, Arya using her skills to fight white walkers, Jon leading the fight in the field, Grey Worms death, Wight giants, Viseryon burning people, ice spiders as big as hounds Inside the walls of Winterfell Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei, Davos and Varys are watching the battle. They see Grey Worms death and Sansa and Davos try to comfort Missandei. Varys says they are going to lose Tyrion asks how he knows and Varys scared answers *the flames told me, when I was cut.* Sam and Bran are in the crypts of Winterfell and they find a secret passage out of Winterfell where they could all scape if need be, but Bran senses that there is something more down there and that he needs to see it, Sam tells him that they cant because the way is blocked, then Bran tries to use his powers to see but fails. The Army of the dead starts to win and advance, the living are losing. Most of the main characters return to the safety of Winterfell but Jon and Beric Dondarion are surrounded by Wights. The Night King comes down to kill them, it seems that he wants to do it himself. Beric faces him and hits him with a Valeryan steel sword but it shatters, then he grabs a dragon glass dagger from the floor and stabs him, but it also breaks, and the Night King kills him. Jon terrified realizes it wont be so easy to stop him. Rhaegal frees himself comes down to help Jon. Jon escapes in the Dragon but must leave Ghost behind who also dies. In Winterfell everyone is escaping by the secret passage, there is no way to win this fight. But they realize that they wont go far if the dead follow them, so some men must stay behind. The Nights Watch and the Wildlings stay. Jaime decides to stay too and lead them. He says goodbye to Tyrion. Jaimie is all in black except his golden hand which he gives to Brienne, he also asks her if she could fill Jaimies pages on the white book. Brienne objects saying that Jaimie swore an oath to fight beside them, not to die for them and Jaime responds *then Ill have to be an oath breaker to the end of my days.* The tunnel leads them to a hill from which you can see Winterfell in the distance. Tormund says he never imagined dying fighting side by side with crows to Dolorous Edd. He agrees. Jaime dies honorably commanding the watch ant trying to take down as many Wights and Walkers as he can. Eventually the castle falls and is burned by Viseryon, only the crypts remain. Jon arrives to the hill as they all watch Winterfell burn. Sansa is crying, and everyone is in a depressive mood as they start their way down the Kingsroad. Only a few thousand men have survived and are generally very hurt. There is no hope left, the dream of spring has died.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 4**

The Long Night

Melisandre enters the temple of r'hllor in Volantis. She speaks with Kinvara and tells her the great other has returned to bring death upon as all. She asks for a look in the great fire and reinforcements to bring to Westeros. Kinvara agrees. Melisandre looks into the great flames, she looks sad but hopeful \(we dont know what she is seeing\) 

\-Opening Credits\-

Our heroes and whats left of their army march south by the Kingsroad as fast as they can even if they really dont know where to go. Men are deserting and dying every day. Everyone is giving up Jon says that they fought, and they lost but Sansa steps up and tell that no is not the time to mourn, right now they need to survive and defeat the Night King and that the only way to do it is go to Kings Landing and try to make a new alliance with Cersei. Tyrion agrees and they all decide to go to the capital. Qyburn shows Cersei all the ballistae and wildfire, and his new invention. Its a horn that lets him control the Wight, he makes a demonstration with the remains. Word reaches them that Winterfell has fallen. Cersei smiles. Theon hears of the fall of Winterfell and decides to sail to kings landing, he thinks that if there is another battle against the dead it will be there. Jon and company find Dany and Drogon in their way south, at first, they are angry because she left but then they notice she is full of blood. Dany tells Jon shes had a miscarriage and that she is sorry she couldnt fight. Jon is sad and hugs her and tells it doesnt matter and that he loves her now and always even if they both are Targaryens. Jon bends the knee before her even if he already did that to probe her that he is not interested in the throne. Along the way Bran says he must go to the isle of faces, that he must see. Sam and a little escort bring him there. Sam and Bran find children of the forest in the isle the only ones left. Bran enters a vision. He sees the last hero or azor ahai \(who is the thirteenth lord commander of the night watch, there would have been 12 commanders already during the long night but they all died and now are white walkers\) forge lightbringer plunging the sword to his wifes hearth, he sees him kill the previous leader of the white walkers, the one created by the children of the forest. But before dying they turn his wife into a walker. The Hero doesnt know this. He joins the watch to hunt down the remaining Others. One day beyond the wall he finds a woman with eyes as cold as ice. Its his wife Nissa Nissa. They make love and he brings her to The Nightfort. He becomes the Nights King slowly turning into a walker. He makes sacrifices to her, so she can create more White Walkers. Eventually the king on the north and the king beyond the wall unite forces to defeat him. He is exiled to the far north \(the king in the north was his brother so he spared his life\) and she is taken captive by the king in the north. He completes his transformation to a White Walker but is weak. With time and the cold he gets back his power \(some 8 thousand years\). Bran also sees the Night King walking through the crypts of Winterfell, he enters to the section that was blocked and starts going deeper. Finally, he finds the nights queen, his wife but she dyes just in front of him because of the heat of Winterfells hot springs. He arrived late and now is full of rage and grief. At the end the villain was just the hero of the other side trying to get his wife back but now he wants revenge and to destroy this entire continent. Bran realizes that he should have seen this before and he could have prevented this war from happening just giving his wife back to him but now is too late and they are all doomed because winter is coming to get them. Bran and Sam stay in the isle because Bran says he is of more help here than in any other place because the Weirwoods augment his powers. The children of the forest start praying all around him to make him even more powerful. Jon thanks Rhaegal for saving him and bonds with him a little more, Dany tells Jon to mount him Jon does and so he is flying again but this time he has control over the dragon. Jon comes down and reflects about that the dragon is named after his father. This still confuses Jon as he doesnt seem to know who he is. They arrive to Kings Landing \(Jon and Dany in dragon back, Cersei sees them from the map area\) and ask for an audience with Cersei. Cersei sits high above them all while they step in the throne room. Cersei is surprised that they survived and welcomes them. She is upset that Sansa and Arya al also with them and calls them wolf whores. They make a new alliance, Cersei easily cooperates, the Golden Company will fight beside them, and theyll have all her recourses available, and tells them of the horn Qyburn has created. She tells them that earlier Theon Greyjoy and the iron born had arrived. They see the iron fleet and talk with Theon. After all the rest have left Theon thanks Jon about the council he gave him at the end of season 7 and says to Jon that he can be a Targaryen and a Stark. Jon smiles and leaves. Brienne fills Jaimies pages in the white book.  Tyrion and Cersei speak, she hears about Jaimies death, they drink some wine for him. Varys speaks with a little bird, and questions him about Cersei and Qyburn. He promises him sweets and tells him to stay hidden that if they win this war he will need his help. Everyone gathers in the room of the small council sessions and prepare their plans to defend the city. Tyrion suggests placing wildfire pots in the surroundings of the city, so they can burn the Wights when they arrive. They will place ballistae in the walls, with dragon glass tips. The ironmen will shoot them from the ships. Garrison of men will be prepared to step into the field once the wildfire has exploded. Some of them will even ride elephants. Jon and Daenerys will fight from the air with dragons. They receive a raven from Bran saying that he will stay in the isle \(yes, Sam brought birds to the isle\). Cersei has a secret meeting with the commander of the golden company and tells him once the death are defeated he wants them to turn against Jon and Dany and kill everyone in their side except her brother, he has some objections, but Cersei reminds him that his word is as good as gold and offers to pay double. He accepts. Varyss little bird has heard this conversation and tells the eunuch. Jon and Dany have epic RED KEEP SEX \(?\).  The army of the dead kills everyone in White Harbor, The Eyrie \(They put a spear trough sweet Robin\), Riverrun, Harrenhal, Casterly Rock, Dragonstone And they finally arrive at Kings Landing.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 5**

The Great War

\-Opening Credits showing everything destroyed and frozen\-

A huge snowstorm starts in Kings Landing as the army of the dead approaches. Everyone is at their positions. Cersei locks herself the same in the tower where she was during Blackwater, Sansa, Tyrion and other characters who arent involved in the fighting \(the mountain is protecting them outside\). Cersei has poison to die if need be like she did back in season 2. 

The first one to arrive is the Night King in his dragon. The great horn is placed and ready to be used. Qyburn uses the horn himself because of how proud he is of it. It makes a very loud sound and for a moment the dragon stops, but then it burns Qyburn and everyone around there with its blue flames. Jon and Dany go into their dragons, a dance of dragons starts in the sky ant the city begins to burn. The Wights are arriving, and the wildfire trap is activated. Bronn shoots the arrow as he did in blackwater. The hound looks away. The trap kills a lot of Wights and is very useful, but the walkers are coming and extinguishing the flames. Fire arrows start to rain on them from the ships and the walls. The garrison comes out from the gate. They are led by the commander of the golden company in an elephant. Arya, Davos and Gendry ride with them \(Brienne stays behind to look after Sansa\). A brutal fight starts, the biggest battle ever in game of thrones with thousands of fighters and 3 dragons. Bran wargs into Nymeria and leads her wolf pack down to the battle. There are lots of epic and tense moments... Gendry charges to a white walker with his Warhammer like Robert did in the trident against Rhaegar, the elephants charge giants and spiders, Arya uses the face of a Wight to get close to a walker and kill him, the battle field is full of flames of three different colors \(orange, blue, and green\)  Even if they fight valiantly the Wights are too many so they start winning again, Arya is trapped, Davos is against bad odds, the iron fleet is burning and then over the horizon appear a fleet of red ships. From those ships fighters all in red wielding fiery weapons start to land ashore. They are the fiery hand. They save Davos and Arya and all the rest. Arya sees Melisandre and she nods to her. Davos goes to speak with her. She says she must speak with Jon. Davos angrily accompanies her to the city. Davos leaves her there and tells her Jon is in the dragon. Melisandre encounters Varys. She tells him to help her get to Jon. In the sky the battle between the dragons is fierce. Eventually Rhaegal dies and Jon falls. Dany is sad, but she also rapidly burns the dragons body, so it cant be turned. The dead enter the city, even with the fiery hand is hasnt been enough to stop them. The streets are burning and most of the fighting is happening on them. Jon is in middle of the fight trying to make his way to the ballistae and try to shoot Vyserion. Jon encounters Varys and Melisandre in the way. She tells Jon in a cryptic fashion that he needs to kill the woman he loves to forge lightbringer and bring the dawn. Jon doesnt immediately understand her but thanks her for the information and follows his way. Cersei is having contraption, her child is about to be born, so she rushes into her chambers and asks for some servants to help her with the child. He orders the mountain to stay behind and watch that no one comes close. The Hound has had too much of the fire and returns to the keep only to find The Mountain inside. The Hound tries to tell him that right now he doesnt want to fight but The Mountain attacks anyway, then the hound realizes that his brothers eyes are blue as a Wights \(The Mountain has been undead all this time, as an artificial Wight created by Qyburn, and now the White Walkers control him\). They fight in the room with the map of Westeros painted in it. The Mountain is wining and throws The Hounds Valyrian steel sword away. The Hound has no choice but to face his fears and kill his brother with fire. Bran is in using his powers to help in the fight when a white walker arrives at the isle of faces. The Wights cant enter because of the magic, but its not powerful enough to kill the walker. The walker kills the guards protecting them and Sam must face him alone wielding Hearts Bane. Sam is scared but wins the duel saving Bran. In the middle of the fighting Jon tries to reach the ballistae, but in the way he encounters Ghost as a Wight. Jon fights against him but the direwolf is wining. Arya comes to the rescue and helps Jon fight him. Jon kills him with Longclaw. Arya goes back to the battle riding her direwolf Nymeria. There would be some more epic fighting. The tower where Brienne, Sansa and Podrick are starts to burn. They get out, but they are ambushed by Wights and a walker. Brienne and Pod fight side by side protecting Sansa \(and Tyrion\). Podrick dies having killed the walker. Brienne and Sansa seek refuge in a common home. Tyrion sees all the destruction and goes to the cellar to get drunk . Jon gets to the Ballistae. He shots and fails 2 times. When he is about to shoot the third time Dany uses Drogon to stop Viseryon from moving. Jon has a clear shot, but it would mean kill Drogon too. Dany tells him to do it, so Jon does it and kills both dragons. They start to fall. Drogon and Dany fall to the throne room behind the iron throne and the night king and Vyserion just outside the throne room. Jon gets to the throne room too by a side door and goes to Danys side. The throne room is burned and full of snow just as it was in the vision in season 2. The night king enters and is ready to fight. Jon realizes the meaning of Melisandres words and knows what he must do. With a tear in his eye he looks at Daenerys and stabs Longclaw right through her chest. She falls on to the iron throne and she starts dying seated on it. Longclaw bursts into flames and an epic final confrontation takes place between Jon and the Night King. A true song of ice and fire. The night king is better than Jon and Bran sees this, so he tries to enter the night kings mind. Inside his head the night king and bran have a psychic battle. Its really tens but Bran slows him down enough for Jon to land a fatal blow. We would see all the Wights and white walkers die. Jon is wounded and bleeding, he walks to Daenerys and touches her hand and tells her hi is sorry. She smiles and dies. Jon still bleeding walks outside the room and falls to the ground. Having accomplished his purpose Jon dies for real in the steps of the red keep seeing the sun for the first time this season while the stark theme plays in the background. Melisandre also sees the sun, takes out her collar and steps into the flames \(Davos sees this in the distance while he holds the burned stag on his hand\). The last shot of the episode would be Jon dead in the same position than in the finale of season 5. The great war is over, and the dawn has finally come.

**SEASON 8  EPISODE 6**

A Song of Ice and Fire

\-Opening Credits\-

The episode starts with all the wights and Walkers dying and everyone looking relieved as the sum comes out. But then the golden company start killing Cerseis enemies \(the northern army\). Arya sees this and kills the commander of the golden company. Arya asks him why they did this, and he responds it were Cerseis orders and that they never break their contract. Arya wears his face and orders the fight to stop. She goes see Cersei with the face. She finds Cersei bleeding and suffering on her bed. Cersei is clearly dying so Arya doesnt kill her. Cersei asks Arya to find Tyrion and bring him. Arya finds Tyrion in the cellar very drunk and tells him the battle is over they have won and that his sister wants to see him. Tyrion arrives at Cerseis chambers. Cersei is dying of childbirth, shes had a dwarf son and is dying of it like their mother. Cersei laughs at the irony. She apologizes for all the horrible things shes done to her dwarf brother and asks him to rise the child. She tells him to take The Rock and rise the child there. Cersei names the child Tywin and says *promise me Tyrion* as she dies. Tyrion takes the baby and goes to the throne room. Every main character that has survived is there. They are sad about Jon and Dany. They say some words for them and discuss what to do now. Tyrion says that they must hold a great council with all the lords and ladies that have survived. The council will be at Oldtown because it hasnt suffered much on the wars and the maesters are there. Everyone leaves the throne room. Arya goes to a room alone and cries for Jon, the hound finds her and comforts her. Tyrion finds 3 dragon eggs beside Drogons body, but he decides to throw them in the ocean where no one can find them, Bronn asks him why he did that, Tyrion tells him the dragons have done much more harm than good. Bran and Sam also see the sun rise from the isle, Bran tells Sam there is one more thing he wants to do before leaving the island. Bran goes into a vision and sees the black cells with Eddard lying there, Bran speaks with his father and thanks to the additional power he has in the island Ned can see him. Ned asks if everything is well. Bran doubts a moment and the answer*s y*es, Ned nods and says that then he has nothing to worry about. The guards come to take him. Sometime later everyone is in Oldtown for the great council. All the lords, great and small are there. The maesters inform that it will start in an hour. Everyone is meeting each other when Tyrion asks to speak with Varys privately, only Bronn comes with them.  Tyrion offers Varys wine and he refuses, but Tyrion tells him to drink. Varys reluctantly does so. Tyrion asks Varys why and revels he knows the spiders plan to kill everyone in the meeting. Tyrion spoke with the little birds in Kings Landing. He is sad and disappointed. Varys tells Tyrion that the flames told him that when the long night comes if the right king or queen doesnt sit the Iron Throne they would all be doomed \(with more poetic words\). He tells Tyrion about all his failed attempts at that. He says he really does care about the people of the realm and so tough the best monarch would be same one who did the best for them. With all his failed attempts he started to grow frustrated and started wondering how it would feel to sit in that throne. He never had the chance to try to climb those steps until now. Tyrion asks is he would also have killed him. Varys says it was nothing personal. Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Varys and he does it. The meeting starts, and all the lords start discussing who the next king should be, who has the best claim. The discussion grows really tense until Tyrion says he trusted Daenerys because she was the queen he chose. Tyrion suggest that a council may be hold every 5 years to elect the new king or queen. Every lord great and small might have a vote and anyone has a chance to be king. The only thing they would need to do is step up and tell what their plans for the realm are. A great king could rule all his life wile a mad one would only last 5 years. They also would set some laws that even the king must obey. They decide the first king election will be hold in 5 years, until then the maesters will have the regency while the lords focus on rebuilding and repopulating.  Then they discuss the situation of the north and the iron islands. They are offered the chance to be independent kingdoms but Sansa refuses because she sees that thing will be done better now in Westeros. Theon does the same following Sansas example. They are granted the honorary titles of queen in the North and king of the Iron Islands to preserve peace in the future. The empty castles are given to new and old lords. Gendry is legitimized and given Storms End, Bronn is given the twins, Edmure is given Riverrun back, Sam Hornhill, Tyrion the rock Bran says that the nights watch must be reformed in the case that the death come back again. Jorah Mormont offers to rebuild the watch and become the 1000th lord commander. Tyrion says that the iron thrones must be destroyed, and a more comfortable throne must be built to replace it. The great council ends. Daenerys and the iron throne are burnt together while Jon is being burned in the north \(in the ruins of Winterfell\) like the men of the watch and the wildlings did. Tyrion and Bronn are in their way to their castles. Tyrion gives Bronn a really big sack of gold and tells him he will change the wealth of house Lannister from gold to wine. Everyone arrives at their seats. The hound becomes a monk with a vow of silence finally finding peace. Davos will return to the sea. He will bring Missandei to her homeland of Naath. Up at the wall the Stark sisters say goodbye to Bran who must go beyond\-the\-wall to watch the death as the new 3 eyed raven. He says that maybe the dead never return but that he must go and watch. Jorah says that if Westeros is changing the watch must change too. From no on you wont take the black for life but you will serve some years and at the end of your time you shall be recompensed. The Starks sisters and Brienne walk through the ruined Winterfell that is being rebuilt. Brienne wants to be Sansas first Queenguard, to which she responds that she is no true queen. Brienne answers that she is no true knight, Sansa smiles and makes Brienne her queenguard. Sansa asks Arya what she will do now, she suggests that she could give her, a castle. Arya says no, that is not her. She asks Sansa what is west of Westeros and tells her she will find out but promises to return some day. Before she leaves Sansa has a final thing to show her. They go down to the crypts, the only part left intact. Sansa had ordered a statue of the whole Stark family made. Everyone is there: Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Rickon, Bran, Sansa, Arya and even Jon. Cut to black.

Some years later we are at Hornhill. In the yards there is a singer singing a song about Jon and Dany defeating the night king. Gilly and little Sam are in the yard dancing happily. Sam looks down from a window and smiles. Then he finishes his book about The Great War and we see that he names it *A Song Of Ice And Fire*.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A Dream of Spring:

We see all the castles of the realm destroyed by the white walkers and the Night King sitting on the iron throne, Its Brans vision of how Westeros would end up if they dont win this war.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen get married in White Harbor. They claim that it is to make the northern lords accept their alliance more easily, but it really is for love. The nights watch and the wildlings arrive to Winterfell \(they would be useless at Castle Black\) led by Tormund and Beric. They inform Sansa that the wall has fallen. Bran already knew. Jaimie is in his way to Casterly Rock when Bronn finds him and tells him that he is coming too because he doesnt trust Cersei. Qyburn is examining the remains of the Wight when he is informed that the golden company has arrived. He tells Cersei and she commands them to go to the throne room. Cersei pays the golden company. Their commander vows to Cersei that she shall have Daeneryss head and all her allies dead while he tells the story of the Backfires and how they have no love for the Targaryens. He swears that she shall have blood of the dragon. Euron tries to move on Cersei but she refuses him and says the war is not over yet and she is pregnant. Euron is angry, he feels betrayed by Cersei, so he decides to sail back to the iron islands. He returns to Silence and speaks with Yara about why hes done what hes done while he tortures her. He tells her its because he always was the little brother and could hold no real power and that he was frustrated by that but now he finally has real power to do things like torture people if he wants. Dany and Jon arrive at Winterfell in a very similar scene to when Robert and the Lannisters arrive there in the first episode. Some lords are reluctant to bend the knee to Daenerys, but Jon tells them what shes done and convinces them. Sansa is also a bit frustrated but does not object as she understands that survival comes first. Then Jon goes inside with Arya, Sansa and Bran and they have their emotional reunion. Jon goes to the crypts, Dany comes with him, they speak of this war and everyone Jon has lost. Jon tells her about Ned and his brothers Robb and Rickon, he even tells her about Ygritte, Dany tells Jon about Viseryon and Khal Drogo. Finally, they speak about Rhaegar and Lyanna too. Sam is reading the books he stole, he reads the story of the 13th Lord Commander of the Night Watch and the last hero. Jon comes to see him and tells him to come to the great hall, Sam doesnt have time to tell Jon the truth of his parentage. Jon gives orders to prepare Winterfells defenses. Jon and Tyrion talk, in the same place where they first met, about Jons and Danys marriage \(he thinks some lords may see him as a traitor\) and asks Jon if he loves Dany even if he already knows the answer, Jon doesnt respond. Dany has felt some stomach ache and the master of Winterfell tells her she is pregnant. Theon arrives to the Iron islands to find them almost empty. His uncle Aeron is in Pyke. Theon takes him captive. Jaimie arrives at the rock and goes to the dungeons where he finds Edmure Tully. Jaime feeds him and lets him have a bath. Jamie promises that if the Tully army comes with him north \(Cersei controls the Lannister army\) Edmure shall have the Riverlands back and if he doesnt they will all die. He accepts. Sansa and Tyrion reunite and speak of everything that has happened to them. Bran and Sam take Jon to the crypts, so no one hears them and finally tell him the truth. We see The Last Hearth fall.

SEASON 8  EPISODE 2

I am The Storm.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon is confused by what Sam and Bran just told him and doesnt know what to do with it. Jon goes to talk to Dany and tries to tell her, but she reveals that shes pregnant and Jon cant bring himself to do it. Arya reunites with Gendry and the Hound. Cersei commands the Golden Company to take back the south and orders Qyburn to create more wildfire and ballistae for the dragons. Qyburn informs her that the other experiment is going well. We see a montage of the Golden Company taking back the castles in the south including Dragonstone. Jaimie arrives at Winterfell with Edmure, Bronn and the Tully forces. At first, they dont trust him, but Brienne stands up for him. Jaime gives the Starks Widows Wail to prove that he is trust worthy and he confesses that he throwed Bran out the window and asks forgiveness. Bran forgives him and tells him that if he hadnt pushed him his third eye wouldnt have opened. But the northern lords arent happy about this, one takes out a sword and menaces him but Jon orders him to stop . Jaimie informs them about Cerseis betrayal, Tyrion is disappointed but not surprised, then Varys tells them that Cersei controls the south again. Daenerys is angry and wants to do something about it, but Tyrion and Jon tell her there is nothing she can do. Jon asks Sansa and Arya what to do with the information he has, and they tell him that the honorable thing to do is to tell everyone, but that it may not be the most intelligent thing to do.  Sam is reading and finds that there was a Valyrian steel sword forged in Westeros thousands of years ago and tells Bran to go have a look. Bran sees that it is forged using dragon fire, dragon glass and steel. They ask Gendry if he could forge one and Dany if she could provide the fire. They forge the first valerian steel sword in centuries. Jaimie is checking their plans to defend Winterfell with Tyrion when Jon calls everyone to the great hall and tells the truth. Dany angry and confused doesnt want to believe him but Bran tells her things that only she knew, and she has no other option than believe them. Some northern lords are also angry about this and leave Winterfell saying that they wont fight together with Lannisters and Targaryens. Jon says he has no interest on the iron throne, but she leaves flying with Drogon. Rhaegal stays and cries for his mother. Word reaches Winterfell that The Last Heart and Karhold have fallen. They have no other choice than prepare their defenses and hope Dany returns in time. A letter from Cersei also arrives saying that the help is coming but Jaimie doesnt believe it and throws the letter to the fire. Euron Greyjoy arrives at the Iron Islands and finds Theon beside the seastone chair. Theon challenges him to 1v1 combat, at first Euron is reluctant but Theon convinces him asking if he is afraid. They fight in the same place where the kingsmoot took place while a huge storm starts. Its a long fight but finally Theon wins as Euron falls to his death in the ocean, but with his last breath he orders Yara killed and so it happens. Theon cant save her, but he takes the head of the man who killed her. With her dying breath she tells Theon he should be the king of the Iron Islands. Theon gives an epic speech and becomes the king, no longer afraid or weak.

SEASON 8  EPISODE 3

Winterfell

The army of the dead is seen in the horizon by Jon. The signal is given for everyone to go to their places. 

\-Opening Credits\-

The army of the dead is here, and Daenerys is nowhere to be seen. They chain Rhaegal inside the walls so the night king cant have him. The unsullied and the Dothraki will fight in the open field and the Northmen Will stay close to the walls of Winterfell and the Tully men and Nights watch will man the walls. They all have dragon glass weapons and some even Valyrian steel. The archers will use fire arrows. Grey Worm gives a goodbye kiss to Missandei fearing that he might die. A huge battle begins. There are lots of epic moments: Jaimie and Brienne fighting together, Tormund saving the hound, Arya using her skills to fight white walkers, Jon leading the fight in the field, Grey Worms death, Wight giants, Viseryon burning people, ice spiders as big as hounds Inside the walls of Winterfell Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei, Davos and Varys are watching the battle. They see Grey Worms death and Sansa and Davos try to comfort Missandei. Varys says they are going to lose Tyrion asks how he knows and Varys scared answers the flames told me, when I was cut. Sam and Bran are in the crypts of Winterfell and they find a secret passage out of Winterfell where they could all scape if need be, but Bran senses that there is something more down there and that he needs to see it, Sam tells him that they cant because the way is blocked, then Bran tries to use his powers to see but fails. The Army of the dead starts to win and advance, the living are losing. Most of the main characters return to the safety of Winterfell but Jon and Beric Dondarion are surrounded by Wights. The Night King comes down to kill them, it seems that he wants to do it himself. Beric faces him and hits him with a Valeryan steel sword but it shatters, then he grabs a dragon glass dagger from the floor and stabs him, but it also breaks, and the Night King kills him. Jon terrified realizes it wont be so easy to stop him. Rhaegal frees himself comes down to help Jon. Jon escapes in the Dragon but must leave Ghost behind who also dies. In Winterfell everyone is escaping by the secret passage, there is no way to win this fight. But they realize that they wont go far if the dead follow them, so some men must stay behind. The Nights Watch and the Wildlings stay. Jaime decides to stay too and lead them. He says goodbye to Tyrion. Jaimie is all in black except his golden hand which he gives to Brienne, he also asks her if she could fill Jaimies pages on the white book. Brienne objects saying that Jaimie swore an oath to fight beside them, not to die for them and Jaime responds then Ill have to be an oath breaker to the end of my days. The tunnel leads them to a hill from which you can see Winterfell in the distance. Tormund says he never imagined dying fighting side by side with crows to Dolorous Edd. He agrees. Jaime dies honorably commanding the watch ant trying to take down as many Wights and Walkers as he can. Eventually the castle falls and is burned by Viseryon, only the crypts remain. Jon arrives to the hill as they all watch Winterfell burn. Sansa is crying, and everyone is in a depressive mood as they start their way down the Kingsroad. Only a few thousand men have survived and are generally very hurt. There is no hope left, the dream of spring has died.

SEASON 8  EPISODE 4

The Long Night

Melisandre enters the temple of r'hllor in Volantis. She speaks with Kinvara and tells her the great other has returned to bring death upon as all. She asks for a look in the great fire and reinforcements to bring to Westeros. Kinvara agrees. Melisandre looks into the great flames, she looks sad but hopeful \(we dont know what she is seeing\) 

\-Opening Credits\-

Our heroes and whats left of their army march south by the Kingsroad as fast as they can even if they really dont know where to go. Men are deserting and dying every day. Everyone is giving up Jon says that they fought, and they lost but Sansa steps up and tell that no is not the time to mourn, right now they need to survive and defeat the Night King and that the only way to do it is go to Kings Landing and try to make a new alliance with Cersei. Tyrion agrees and they all decide to go to the capital. Qyburn shows Cersei all the ballistae and wildfire, and his new invention. Its a horn that lets him control the Wight, he makes a demonstration with the remains. Word reaches them that Winterfell has fallen. Cersei smiles. Theon hears of the fall of Winterfell and decides to sail to kings landing, he thinks that if there is another battle against the dead it will be there. Jon and company find Dany and Drogon in their way south, at first, they are angry because she left but then they notice she is full of blood. Dany tells Jon shes had a miscarriage and that she is sorry she couldnt fight. Jon is sad and hugs her and tells it doesnt matter and that he loves her now and always even if they both are Targaryens. Jon bends the knee before her even if he already did that to probe her that he is not interested in the throne. Along the way Bran says he must go to the isle of faces, that he must see. Sam and a little escort bring him there. Sam and Bran find children of the forest in the isle the only ones left. Bran enters a vision. He sees the last hero or azor ahai \(who is the thirteenth lord commander of the night watch, there would have been 12 commanders already during the long night but they all died and now are white walkers\) forge lightbringer plunging the sword to his wifes hearth, he sees him kill the previous leader of the white walkers, the one created by the children of the forest. But before dying they turn his wife into a walker. The Hero doesnt know this. He joins the watch to hunt down the remaining Others. One day beyond the wall he finds a woman with eyes as cold as ice. Its his wife Nissa Nissa. They make love and he brings her to The Nightfort. He becomes the Nights King slowly turning into a walker. He makes sacrifices to her, so she can create more White Walkers. Eventually the king on the north and the king beyond the wall unite forces to defeat him. He is exiled to the far north \(the king in the north was his brother so he spared his life\) and she is taken captive by the king in the north. He completes his transformation to a White Walker but is weak. With time and the cold he gets back his power \(some 8 thousand years\). Bran also sees the Night King walking through the crypts of Winterfell, he enters to the section that was blocked and starts going deeper. Finally, he finds the nights queen, his wife but she dyes just in front of him because of the heat of Winterfells hot springs. He arrived late and now is full of rage and grief. At the end the villain was just the hero of the other side trying to get his wife back but now he wants revenge and to destroy this entire continent. Bran realizes that he should have seen this before and he could have prevented this war from happening just giving his wife back to him but now is too late and they are all doomed because winter is coming to get them. Bran and Sam stay in the isle because Bran says he is of more help here than in any other place because the Weirwoods augment his powers. The children of the forest start praying all around him to make him even more powerful. Jon thanks Rhaegal for saving him and bonds with him a little more, Dany tells Jon to mount him Jon does and so he is flying again but this time he has control over the dragon. Jon comes down and reflects about that the dragon is named after his father. This still confuses Jon as he doesnt seem to know who he is. They arrive to Kings Landing \(Jon and Dany in dragon back, Cersei sees them from the map area\) and ask for an audience with Cersei. Cersei sits high above them all while they step in the throne room. Cersei is surprised that they survived and welcomes them. She is upset that Sansa and Arya al also with them and calls them wolf whores. They make a new alliance, Cersei easily cooperates, the Golden Company will fight beside them, and theyll have all her recourses available, and tells them of the horn Qyburn has created. She tells them that earlier Theon Greyjoy and the iron born had arrived. They see the iron fleet and talk with Theon. After all the rest have left Theon thanks Jon about the council he gave him at the end of season 7 and says to Jon that he can be a Targaryen and a Stark. Jon smiles and leaves. Brienne fills Jaimies pages in the white book.  Tyrion and Cersei speak, she hears about Jaimies death, they drink some wine for him. Varys speaks with a little bird, and questions him about Cersei and Qyburn. He promises him sweets and tells him to stay hidden that if they win this war he will need his help. Everyone gathers in the room of the small council sessions and prepare their plans to defend the city. Tyrion suggests placing wildfire pots in the surroundings of the city, so they can burn the Wights when they arrive. They will place ballistae in the walls, with dragon glass tips. The ironmen will shoot them from the ships. Garrison of men will be prepared to step into the field once the wildfire has exploded. Some of them will even ride elephants. Jon and Daenerys will fight from the air with dragons. They receive a raven from Bran saying that he will stay in the isle \(yes, Sam brought birds to the isle\). Cersei has a secret meeting with the commander of the golden company and tells him once the death are defeated he wants them to turn against Jon and Dany and kill everyone in their side except her brother, he has some objections, but Cersei reminds him that his word is as good as gold and offers to pay double. He accepts. Varyss little bird has heard this conversation and tells the eunuch. Jon and Dany have epic RED KEEP SEX \(?\).  The army of the dead kills everyone in White Harbor, The Eyrie \(They put a spear trough sweet Robin\), Riverrun, Harrenhal, Casterly Rock, Dragonstone  And they finally arrive at Kings Landing.

SEASON 8  EPISODE 5

The Great War

\-Opening Credits showing everything destroyed and frozen\-

A huge snowstorm starts in Kings Landing as the army of the dead approaches. Everyone is at their positions. Cersei locks herself the same in the tower where she was during Blackwater, Sansa, Tyrion and other characters who arent involved in the fighting \(the mountain is protecting them outside\). Cersei has poison to die if need be like she did back in season 2. 

The first one to arrive is the Night King in his dragon. The great horn is placed and ready to be used. Qyburn uses the horn himself because of how proud he is of it. It makes a very loud sound and for a moment the dragon stops, but then it burns Qyburn and everyone around there with its blue flames. Jon and Dany go into their dragons, a dance of dragons starts in the sky ant the city begins to burn. The Wights are arriving, and the wildfire trap is activated. Bronn shoots the arrow as he did in blackwater. The hound looks away. The trap kills a lot of Wights and is very useful, but the walkers are coming and extinguishing the flames. Fire arrows start to rain on them from the ships and the walls. The garrison comes out from the gate. They are led by the commander of the golden company in an elephant. Arya, Davos and Gendry ride with them \(Brienne stays behind to look after Sansa\). A brutal fight starts, the biggest battle ever in game of thrones with thousands of fighters and 3 dragons. Bran wargs into Nymeria and leads her wolf pack down to the battle. There are lots of epic and tense moments... Gendry charges to a white walker with his Warhammer like Robert did in the trident against Rhaegar, the elephants charge giants and spiders, Arya uses the face of a Wight to get close to a walker and kill him, the battle field is full of flames of three different colors \(orange, blue, and green\)  Even if they fight valiantly the Wights are too many so they start winning again, Arya is trapped, Davos is against bad odds, the iron fleet is burning and then over the horizon appear a fleet of red ships. From those ships fighters all in red wielding fiery weapons start to land ashore. They are the fiery hand. They save Davos and Arya and all the rest. Arya sees Melisandre and she nods to her. Davos goes to speak with her. She says she must speak with Jon. Davos angrily accompanies her to the city. Davos leaves her there and tells her Jon is in the dragon. Melisandre encounters Varys. She tells him to help her get to Jon. In the sky the battle between the dragons is fierce. Eventually Rhaegal dies and Jon falls. Dany is sad, but she also rapidly burns the dragons body, so it cant be turned. The dead enter the city, even with the fiery hand is hasnt been enough to stop them. The streets are burning and most of the fighting is happening on them. Jon is in middle of the fight trying to make his way to the ballistae and try to shoot Vyserion. Jon encounters Varys and Melisandre in the way. She tells Jon in a cryptic fashion that he needs to kill the woman he loves to forge lightbringer and bring the dawn. Jon doesnt immediately understand her but thanks her for the information and follows his way. Cersei is having contraption, her child is about to be born, so she rushes into her chambers and asks for some servants to help her with the child. He orders the mountain to stay behind and watch that no one comes close. The Hound has had too much of the fire and returns to the keep only to find The Mountain inside. The Hound tries to tell him that right now he doesnt want to fight but The Mountain attacks anyway, then the hound realizes that his brothers eyes are blue as a Wights \(The Mountain has been undead all this time, as an artificial Wight created by Qyburn, and now the White Walkers control him\). They fight in the room with the map of Westeros painted in it. The Mountain is wining and throws The Hounds Valyrian steel sword away. The Hound has no choice but to face his fears and kill his brother with fire. Bran is in using his powers to help in the fight when a white walker arrives at the isle of faces. The Wights cant enter because of the magic, but its not powerful enough to kill the walker. The walker kills the guards protecting them and Sam must face him alone wielding Hearts Bane. Sam is scared but wins the duel saving Bran. In the middle of the fighting Jon tries to reach the ballistae, but in the way he encounters Ghost as a Wight. Jon fights against him but the direwolf is wining. Arya comes to the rescue and helps Jon fight him. Jon kills him with Longclaw. Arya goes back to the battle riding her direwolf Nymeria. There would be some more epic fighting. The tower where Brienne, Sansa and Podrick are starts to burn. They get out, but they are ambushed by Wights and a walker. Brienne and Pod fight side by side protecting Sansa \(and Tyrion\). Podrick dies having killed the walker. Brienne and Sansa seek refuge in a common home. Tyrion sees all the destruction and goes to the cellar to get drunk . Jon gets to the Ballistae. He shots and fails 2 times. When he is about to shoot the third time Dany uses Drogon to stop Viseryon from moving. Jon has a clear shot, but it would mean kill Drogon too. Dany tells him to do it, so Jon does it and kills both dragons. They start to fall. Drogon and Dany fall to the throne room behind the iron throne and the night king and Vyserion just outside the throne room. Jon gets to the throne room too by a side door and goes to Danys side. The throne room is burned and full of snow just as it was in the vision in season 2. The night king enters and is ready to fight. Jon realizes the meaning of Melisandres words and knows what he must do. With a tear in his eye he looks at Daenerys and stabs Longclaw right through her chest. She falls on to the iron throne and she starts dying seated on it. Longclaw bursts into flames and an epic final confrontation takes place between Jon and the Night King. A true song of ice and fire. The night king is better than Jon and Bran sees this, so he tries to enter the night kings mind. Inside his head the night king and bran have a psychic battle. Its really tens but Bran slows him down enough for Jon to land a fatal blow. We would see all the Wights and white walkers die. Jon is wounded and bleeding, he walks to Daenerys and touches her hand and tells her hi is sorry. She smiles and dies. Jon still bleeding walks outside the room and falls to the ground. Having accomplished his purpose Jon dies for real in the steps of the red keep seeing the sun for the first time this season while the stark theme plays in the background. Melisandre also sees the sun, takes out her collar and steps into the flames \(Davos sees this in the distance while he holds the burned stag on his hand\). The last shot of the episode would be Jon dead in the same position than in the finale of season 5. The great war is over, and the dawn has finally come.

SEASON 8  EPISODE 6

A Song of Ice and Fire

\-Opening Credits\-

The episode starts with all the wights and Walkers dying and everyone looking relieved as the sum comes out. But then the golden company start killing Cerseis enemies \(the northern army\). Arya sees this and kills the commander of the golden company. Arya asks him why they did this, and he responds it were Cerseis orders and that they never break their contract. Arya wears his face and orders the fight to stop. She goes see Cersei with the face. She finds Cersei bleeding and suffering on her bed. Cersei is clearly dying so Arya doesnt kill her. Cersei asks Arya to find Tyrion and bring him. Arya finds Tyrion in the cellar very drunk and tells him the battle is over they have won and that his sister wants to see him. Tyrion arrives at Cerseis chambers. Cersei is dying of childbirth, shes had a dwarf son and is dying of it like their mother. Cersei laughs at the irony. She apologizes for all the horrible things shes done to her dwarf brother and asks him to rise the child. She tells him to take The Rock and rise the child there. Cersei names the child Tywin and says promise me Tyrion as she dies. Tyrion takes the baby and goes to the throne room. Every main character that has survived is there. They are sad about Jon and Dany. They say some words for them and discuss what to do now. Tyrion says that they must hold a great council with all the lords and ladies that have survived. The council will be at Oldtown because it hasnt suffered much on the wars and the maesters are there. Everyone leaves the throne room. Arya goes to a room alone and cries for Jon, the hound finds her and comforts her. Tyrion finds 3 dragon eggs beside Drogons body, but he decides to throw them in the ocean where no one can find them, Bronn asks him why he did that, Tyrion tells him the dragons have done much more harm than good. Bran and Sam also see the sun rise from the isle, Bran tells Sam there is one more thing he wants to do before leaving the island. Bran goes into a vision and sees the black cells with Eddard lying there, Bran speaks with his father and thanks to the additional power he has in the island Ned can see him. Ned asks if everything is well. Bran doubts a moment and the answers yes, Ned nods and says that then he has nothing to worry about. The guards come to take him. Sometime later everyone is in Oldtown for the great council. All the lords, great and small are there. The maesters inform that it will start in an hour. Everyone is meeting each other when Tyrion asks to speak with Varys privately, only Bronn comes with them.  Tyrion offers Varys wine and he refuses, but Tyrion tells him to drink. Varys reluctantly does so. Tyrion asks Varys why and revels he knows the spiders plan to kill everyone in the meeting. Tyrion spoke with the little birds in Kings Landing. He is sad and disappointed. Varys tells Tyrion that the flames told him that when the long night comes if the right king or queen doesnt sit the Iron Throne they would all be doomed \(with more poetic words\). He tells Tyrion about all his failed attempts at that. He says he really does care about the people of the realm and so tough the best monarch would be same one who did the best for them. With all his failed attempts he started to grow frustrated and started wondering how it would feel to sit in that throne. He never had the chance to try to climb those steps until now. Tyrion asks is he would also have killed him. Varys says it was nothing personal. Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Varys and he does it. The meeting starts, and all the lords start discussing who the next king should be, who has the best claim. The discussion grows really tense until Tyrion says he trusted Daenerys because she was the queen he chose. Tyrion suggest that a council may be hold every 5 years to elect the new king or queen. Every lord great and small might have a vote and anyone has a chance to be king. The only thing they would need to do is step up and tell what their plans for the realm are. A great king could rule all his life wile a mad one would only last 5 years. They also would set some laws that even the king must obey. They decide the first king election will be hold in 5 years, until then the maesters will have the regency while the lords focus on rebuilding and repopulating.  Then they discuss the situation of the north and the iron islands. They are offered the chance to be independent kingdoms but Sansa refuses because she sees that thing will be done better now in Westeros. Theon does the same following Sansas example. They are granted the honorary titles of queen in the North and king of the Iron Islands to preserve peace in the future. The empty castles are given to new and old lords. Gendry is legitimized and given Storms End, Bronn is given the twins, Edmure is given Riverrun back, Sam Hornhill, Tyrion the rock Bran says that the nights watch must be reformed in the case that the death come back again. Jorah Mormont offers to rebuild the watch and become the 1000th lord commander. Tyrion says that the iron thrones must be destroyed, and a more comfortable throne must be built to replace it. The great council ends. Daenerys and the iron throne are burnt together while Jon is being burned in the north \(in the ruins of Winterfell\) like the men of the watch and the wildlings did. Tyrion and Bronn are in their way to their castles. Tyrion gives Bronn a really big sack of gold and tells him he will change the wealth of house Lannister from gold to wine. Everyone arrives at their seats. The hound becomes a monk with a vow of silence finally finding peace. Davos will return to the sea. He will bring Missandei to her homeland of Naath. Up at the wall the Stark sisters say goodbye to Bran who must go beyond\-the\-wall to watch the death as the new 3 eyed raven. He says that maybe the dead never return but that he must go and watch.  Jorah says that if Westeros is changing the watch must change too. From no on you wont take the black for life but you will serve some years and at the end of your time you shall be recompensed. The Starks sisters and Brienne walk through the ruined Winterfell that is being rebuilt. Brienne wants to be Sansas first Queenguard, to which she responds that she is no true queen. Brienne answers that she is no true knight, Sansa smiles and makes Brienne her queenguard. Sansa asks Arya what she will do now, she suggests that she could give her, a castle. Arya says no, that is not her. She asks Sansa what is west of Westeros and tells her she will find out but promises to return some day. Before she leaves Sansa has a final thing to show her. They go down to the crypts, the only part left intact. Sansa had ordered a statue of the whole Stark family made. Everyone is there: Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Rickon, Bran, Sansa, Arya and even Jon. Cut to black.

Some years later we are at Hornhill. In the yards there is a singer singing a song about Jon and Dany defeating the night king. Gilly and little Sam are in the yard dancing happily. Sam looks down from a window and smiles. Then he finishes his book about The Great War and we see that he names it A Song Of Ice And Fire.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
