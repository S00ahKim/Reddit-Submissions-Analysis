These two would be the Grand Maester (whose status as a Maester of the Citadel places them outside the traditional social hierarchy) and the Hand of the King. The Hand of the King can and usually does hold a fair amount of lands, and can nominally continue as ""Lord"" of these lands, but the intensity of the workload that the Hand of the King must contend with renders it all but impossible for said person to oversee day-to-day responsibilities in their own lands. (See Lannister, Tywin; and Stark, Eddard). 

One could make an argument for the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, (much like the Grandmaester, they can hold no lands) but even they are given a bit more freedom to move around, particularly in a time of war. Both Barristan Selmy and Jaime Lannister served as de facto military generals at one point or another, in the Greyjoy Rebellion and the War of the Five Kings, respectively.

The other Small Council offices, however, seem to run quite a lot more loosely. As the series opens, we know of three Small Council members who hold land: Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, and Petyr Baelish. On paper, it would seem like these people are playing the role of both regional governor and cabinet minister/secretary at the same time.

Each of these three handles these dual responsibilities in a different way: 

Master of Coin Baelish, having inherited a small and rather insignificant piece of land, focuses chiefly on his national responsibilities, as they provide a greater springboard for him to gain power. 

Stannis, the Master of Ships, is long gone by the time Ned arrives at King's Landing. He apparently feared that the Lannisters would come after him next after the death of Jon Arryn, so he returns to Dragonstone to brace himself for war in the event that the Lannisters attempt a coup. But he can apparently justify his stepping away without seriously rocking the boat at that point, since he can legitimately say that he has responsibilities to the people of Dragonstone.

And Renly, the Master of Laws, seems to spend more of his time in and around King's Landing, though he is also the Lord of Storm's End. Renly only leaves the capital once he guesses that the Lannisters likely have a large target painted on his back as well.

Three landed Small Council members; three different approaches. Are any of these considered more correct/accepted than the others? Or are the responsibilities/powers of an office at any given time determined more by the person holding it, and their relationships with the monarch and their colleagues on the Small Council.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Okay, so, out of the blue, this entire generation of Starks is capable of warging, huh? Talk about an unexplained and disastrous plot device with no backing explanation whatsoever. This will result in the destruction of ASOIAF's legacy for sure.

This Bran kid breaks his legs and all of a sudden he begins to have warg dreams? Stupid, lazy, uber-contrived plot device. All of the Stark children of this generation are capable of warging, just like that? Stupid, lazy, uber-contrived, unexplained and story-breaking plot device, GRRM -- you are sullying your legacy as a writer every passing day.

I know well-nigh all will disagree with my assessment, but I think this aspect of the story is absolutely abysmal and ludicrous. There's a theory that Jon, following his stabbing, warged into Ghost... just like that. If this happens, I fear for what other contrived, out of the blue plot devices will follow.

Warging will ruin the series' legacy, and Bran Stark's story is so terribly done, lacking in fundamental fortitude entirely and uninteresting. I hope this disastrous plot device doesn't invade the stories of the other Stark children, I really do; their individual stories are actually interesting.

About halfway through, the show past the manga story wise and the two diverged and the show and the manga had two different endings. Once the manga was near completion they created a new TV series that followed the manga all the way through. 

Now Game of Thrones is a lot further along than Fullmetal Alchemist was and the producers of the show are aware of the ending GRRM has in mind for the books. However we are realistically 3-5 years away from A Dream of Spring being released. So unless GRRM is very proactive with producers about what is happening with A Dream of Spring we will probably have some more plot deviation. However the stories could find a way to end the same way even with the differences. 

I know this is a lot harder to do given that this isn't an animated series but would you want to see  the TV series redone once all the books are released and do a more faithful adaptation of the source material or would you rather let the series end and enjoy the differences created?

For the new year (and into the next), I'm going to read A Song of Ice and Fire and re-watch the show, one chapter or episode per day. 344 chapters and 60 episodes in just over 13 months. In doing this, I've made a *rough* order in which to read &amp; watch at the same time. I used [this chart](http://joeltronics.github.io/got-book-show/bookshow.html) for the placing of episodes after their (major) events have happened in the books. A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons are in chronological order, according to [this guy](http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-readerfriendly-combined-reading-order-for-a). I wouldn't suggest this for first-time watchers/readers (due to differences, overlaps, references etc.), but feel free to use this in your own re-readings/watches, or comment with any suggestions. Some events, like Theon's adventures, happen in the show before the books when using this order, but I wanted to have a somewhat even gap between episodes. [Chapter titles are here](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Chapters), and if you're unaware of the abbreviations I've used, we've got AGOT (A Game of Thrones - Book 1), ACOK (A Clash of Kings - Book 2), ASOS (A Song of Swords - Book 3), AFFC (A Feast for Crows - Book 4), ADWD (A Dance with Dragons - Book 5) and TV (Game of Thrones season.episode). I haven't included the released chapters of The Winds of Winter.

Margery is better than Cersei, but she's power-hungry and fully bent on giving the power to Tyrell. This is far from the best interest of westeros.

Hosted on GitHub and built 'in the cloud' I'm hoping to build a fantastic resource for Kindle (and other ebook readers, send me a PR!) that will last for years to come. Additional dictionaries expand on what the x-ray features in Kindle e-readers already have with more definitions, images, maps e.t.c.

This project is very young and needs help, please come and send issues and patches! I'm currently reading a Storm of Swords so am rather reluctant to read the wikis but seeing the current state of dictionary projects I felt I needed to do something.

When Tommen goes to confront the High Sparrow following Loras Tyrell's arrest, there's a very tense moment when the High Sparrow's followers deny him entrance, stating that he is not to be disturbed while he is in prayer. The Kingsguard leading his security detail tells Tommen that he &amp; his men will cut their way through to the High Sparrow if he gives the order, but Tommen clearly wants to avoid bloodshed if at all possible.

Personally, even if Tommen's decision was informed more by fear than pragmatics, I still think that this was probably a wise move. It's reasonable to think that he would remember the riot that Joffrey sparked when he recklessly ordered his guards to kill the entire crowd of smallfolk indiscriminately when one attacked him. And that really didn't work out well for anyone involved.

Still, Tommen's decision to just leave the sept right then and there to find ""another way"" seems curious. Why not just wait at the sept until the High Sparrow is finished praying? The Faith Militant isn't quite bold enough at this point to outright *refuse* the king an audience, and the High Sparrow would have to leave the building eventually. Sure, it is certainly a slight against both Tommen himself and the authority of the Iron Throne for the High Sparrow to not immediately or almost immediately clear his schedule to see the king, but the longer he stayed in there, the more it would look as though the High Sparrow was going to great lengths to avoid him. And if the High Sparrow were to try and avoid Tommen by leaving the sept via a different entrance, this would also make him look a bit weak and petty.

I'm almost positive that Tommen didn't have the negotiating skills to actually get anywhere with the High Sparrow in a face-to-face meeting, but just being able to *secure* such a meeting in the first place would be a small victory. As the High Sparrow would inevitably have to leave the sept eventually, Tommen seemingly had little if anything to lose by holding his ground there for however long it took. And even though the crowd there is hostile to Tommen, it would be pretty much suicidal for any of them to charge Tommen's detail of several well-armored and heavily-equipped knights. (If worse came to worse, they could always send word to the Red Keep to send additional men for backup).",9,7,False,self,,,,,

In Series 5 episode 5, he discusses the impending threat of the white-walkers with Sam. He seems to realise the threat that's approaching when compared to others simply attributing it as scaremongering or children's fantasies. (Cersei's dismissal of Jeor Mormont's warning in series 2 comes to mind, yet Tyrion takes this much more seriously due to his visit to the Wall)

Obviously with Jon's view of the situation being very similar, do you think Stannis' character had so much more to give or was his 'death' (for you pessimists out there) justified?",32,3,False,self,,,,,

In the parlance of our times.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of people seem to ask lately, why don't the White Walkers just sail around The Wall? Why is it taking them so long to go south? 

&amp;nbsp;

Without getting too deep into the origins of the White Walkers, which is mainly speculation anyways, and using a little of that soon to be gone advantage of using book knowledge, let's begin.

&amp;nbsp;

First and foremost, in the books it is established that The Wall is both a physical AND magical barrier. We know this for several reasons, one being a POV chapter from Melisandre in which she thinks to herself how much stronger her spells and powers are now that she has arrived at The Wall. In the past she relied on potions and tricks to accomplish certain ""magically"" feats, but no longer has need of them at The Wall.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, in the books, when Sam reaches The Wall after the battle at the Fist of the First Men, the passage way he finds under the wall, is not a physical barrier, but a magical door that will only open for a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. As Sam happens to be one, the door lets Sam pass. When Bran, Meera, Jojen, and Hodor wish to pass through later, Sam literally takes them back down to the door, recites his vows, and the door again opens and lets the group pass.

&amp;nbsp;

Third, think about who the The Others are. They appear to be beings made literally out of ice, as shown when Jon turns the guy with the icicle spear into enough ice cubes for a frat party. What good would a barrier made of ice being against beings made of pure ice? The answer is, not a lot. Therefore, The Wall has to offer some other form of protection, ie magic. 

&amp;nbsp;

So if we have sufficiently established that The Wall is a physical and magical barrier, lets touch on the Night's Watch for a moment. Now on the show, we simply assume the Night's Watch is simply a valiant order of self sacrificing men, willing to give up their lives for the greater safety of the realm. And while that might have been its original intent, the books imply that there was a deeper connection between the Night's Watch and The Wall.

&amp;nbsp;

In the books, Old Nan (Bran's babysitter in Season 1,) spouts all kinds of stories, proverbs, maxims, etc like most old people tend to do to the younger generation. Unlike some though, Old Nan's provides the readers with clues and hints on a variety of subjects, including the Night's Watch and The Wall. One of her sayings, is that ""the monsters cannot pass so long as the Wall stands and the men of the Night's Watch stay true."" 

&amp;nbsp;

This starts to become very important when you circle back around to the reason the White Walkers don't simply sail around The Wall, or climb over it. If The Wall is a magically barrier, and it stands as long as the men of the Night's Watch stay true, then perhaps The Others have simply been bidding their time until the men of the Night's Watch are no longer ""true"" in order to bring down The Wall.

&amp;nbsp;

Taking a look at recent events, and the fact that we all assume The Others will invade at some point, it becomes readily apparent that The Others have simply been waiting. The Night's Watch was once made of honorable men, third sons as in the case of Benjen Stark and Waymar Royce (the leader of the NW patrol we see slaughtered by Others in the very first episode,) or various other men looking for honor and glory. That is no longer that case, as the NW is mainly composed of thieves, rapists, and murderers who had no choice but to join the NW. Coupled with the murder of the last two lord commanders, Mormont and Jon, it seems obvious the men of the Night's Watch are no longer true, and therefore it seems obvious that The Wall is likely to come down soon, and kick off a full scale invasion of Westeros.

372,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-1-8,2016,1,8,23,401dmg,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS][THEORY] Roose Bolton sidelined?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/401dmg/all_spoilerstheory_roose_bolton_sidelined/,[deleted],1452264749,"From what little we know of Season 6 thus far, it seems reasonable to speculate that one of the major grudge matches of the upcoming season will be between Jon Snow &amp; Ramsay Bolton; ""Battle of the Bastards"" some are already calling it. Considering the bad blood between Houses Stark and Bolton as well as a number of parallels between these two characters individually, this has the potential to be extremely interesting.

Of course, one could certainly have come to a similar conclusion about an upcoming grudge match between Roose Bolton &amp; Stannis Baratheon at the end of S4 and the early part of S5. But for better or worse, it really didn't play out that way. Show!Stannis largely sealed his own fate with a series of miscalculations and poor decisions, and it was *Ramsay,* not Roose, who ultimately dealt the killing blow to his chances at taking Winterfell--from the raid on his encampment that led to Stannis reluctantly agreeing to sacrifice Shireen, to his leading the cavalry charge which decimated the remainder of Stannis' army. In addition, House Bolton's overall strategy against Stannis seems to have been determined more by Ramsay than by Roose (who theoretically ought to have the final say in these matters as the head of House Bolton). Ramsay's aggressive approach won out over Roose's more cautious one. Roose wanted to maintain their strong defensive position and chip away at Stannis gradually, while Ramsay aimed to finish him in one fell swoop.

While Stannis' eventual downfall in the books appears more or less inevitable, there's no doubt that the show accelerated this outcome substantially. While Book!Stannis is moderately successful in rallying several Northern houses to his cause against the Boltons, Show!Stannis makes less of an effort and reaps even fewer benefits. His successful capture of Deepwood Motte, for instance, is not covered in the show. Instead, Stannis seems to prioritize recruiting former members of Mance Rayder's Wildling army to his forces, only to squander that opportunity irreparably by ordering Mance Rayder executed when the latter refuses to unconditionally bend the knee.

Jon, in turn, is actually able to win respect from many Wildlings during this same event, by putting Mance out of his misery before the flames consume him; we can see the political benefits of this decision when Jon travels to Hardhome with Tormund Giantsbane to treat with the Wildlings there. Tormund cites Jon's mercy-killing of Mance as testament that he is honorable and trustworthy, despite the natural suspicions that most Wildlings harbor toward the Night's Watch.

By the S5 finale, Stannis' wife and daughter are dead, Stannis himself is most likely dead, and his army has been wiped out. His two closest advisors, Melisandre and Davos Seaworth, are alive at Castle Black. If Jon could maintain their support and the support of the Wildlings he brought back from Hardhome, he would command a formidable and diverse military force that could very well, among other things, finish the work that Stannis started. The show would appear to be setting this up rather neatly.

While Stannis' accelerated downfall is not too difficult to make sense of in the context of the show, it's not so easy to see what the showrunners plan to do with Roose from here on out. We saw surprisingly little of Show!Roose throughout S5, particularly in the latter half of the season. His ability to control Ramsay appears severely diminished; Roose clearly disapproves of Ramsay's decision flay the household of a vassal lord who is behind on paying his taxes, but is obviously unable to prevent it. In addition to the political benefits of having a Stark marry into House Bolton, Roose may have also hoped that Ramsay taking a wife of such a high noble pedigree as Sansa Stark may have had the effect of tempering him somewhat. If anything, the opposite appears to be true, as he becomes increasingly brazen following his marriage and wedding-night rape of Sansa.

As Season 6 opens, Ramsay can and I have to imagine *will* claim a great deal of credit for Stannis' crushing defeat, particularly in the sense that his aggressive approach succeeded (in the short-term, anyway) despite Roose's reservations.

I can't help but wonder why Roose didn't vocalize these reservations more forcefully in S5. Could he have vetoed Ramsay's ""Twenty Goodmen"" raid? Did he want to? Perhaps he viewed this operation as a win-neutral situation. If Ramsay succeeded in further weakening Stannis, great. If it failed, Roose would lose, at most, 21 men, and the unpredictable Ramsay would be no further threat to his new wife and unborn child. (Whom, as Sansa points out, could very well be in a stronger position to inherit the Bolton assets than Ramsay himself).

But could Roose have really expected that operation to go as smoothly for Ramsay as it did? That within days, Ramsay would be able to crush Stannis in an open field? These events would seem to bolster Ramsay's already strong position in the Bolton military. If the two Bolton goons that attacked Stannis are any indication, the Bolton army under Ramsay consists of many young thrill-seekers, who could be drawn more to the charismatic brute Ramsay than the reserved, calculating Roose. Roose would also seem to lack the benefit of older veteran generals/advisors who could take his side over Ramsay if need be; there is no Kevan Lannister-like figure in Bolton's orbit to temper the rash decisions of the less experienced family members.

Roose Bolton's limited role in crafting their war strategy against Stannis, coupled with his rather limited screentime in S5 overall, leads me to think that, like Stannis, he is not long for this world, at least in Show!Verse. I'm not sure how he'll die, but I certainly wouldn't put it past Ramsay to do the honors himself.

While Ramsay has proven himself to be a more gifted tactician than first appearances would suggest, he lacks Roose's discipline, and would seem destined to lead House Bolton to ruin. If Jon defeats him, this would actually set up an interesting parallel between Roose &amp; Ned Stark. Roose may outlive Ned by many years, but the strong family that Ned built was never completely destroyed, despite Roose's best efforts, and even the remnants of that strong foundation could be enough to doom the Bolton family's comparably weak one.",33,11,False,self,,,,,

R. Martin is following a traditional theme of an end of age fantasy but doing so in a slightly different fashion (more adult, less linear). In the same tradition as many classic fantasies that are somewhat similar such as Lord of Rings with the Elves sailing West, and in the same tradition of the Chronicles of Prydain with all magical creatures moving on or even the 1980's movie Dragon-slayer we see a theme of the rise of age of humankind while witnessing some final major battle(s) marking the end of an age with magic. Looking at the name of GOT series Fire and Ice you see a similar story unfolding. Giants, children of the Forest, Wargs, old God's all are making moves but all appear to be moving in acts that seem to have an air of finality. I see perhaps a final battle between forces that are around these two godlike entities (Fire and Ice) ending with simply mankind left and with magic and creatures that go with it, all gone. Danery's cannot have children and there is not really a confirmed Valerian heir left that has magical properties left in the storyline. If you look at House Stark and their connection to the old northern ways and gods, you see they too are dying out. This leads me to Petyr Baelish, he floats in and out of all novels and quietly acquires more power and more lands. He is a sociopath but highly motivated and driven to rule, these are qualities that we find in many people of leadership. Notice Baelish is doing all of this with no magic, he is simply very good at organizing people, gathering information and making chess like moves one step ahead of everyone. Although he is morally questionable he is some ways an avatar showing just how powerful a human can be with no magic. This is just my own thoughts on the series curious what anyone else thinks?

Todays topic The Line of Succession of the Iron Throne in Westeros.  

Every now and then a post comes up questioning the correct line of succession of the Iron Throne, either following King Tommen, King Stannis, or Queen Daenerys Targaryen, who follows after them?  I will attempt to break down that line of succession drawing from lines that go back over 100 years in Westerosi history to hopefully help those who may be in the dark as to how it might look like..  However I wish to establish a couple of things some of this is a bit speculative,  I will cite characters, or possible characters, that do not exist within the lore of ASOIAF or Game of Thrones, but may exist, or have existed at one point in Westerosi history (This will make a bit more sense as I go forward), and attempt to speculate why those lines are also no longer around.  Most of this will be based in fact however with characters established in the lore of ASOIAF, but very little elaborated on..but thats enough conjecture, lets get going..




----------------


- Spoiler Scope

But as always let's establish our spoiler scope...  We are finally working with a spoilers all scope for one of these posts, but don't worry too much, this post will largely deal with Lore, I will bring up some plot points up to and to the end of season 5 on the show, but will be discussing any plot points that have not yet occurred on HBO...  However with this post in particular, I will have to mention one character that is very unlikely (but not confirmed cut entirely) to appear on the show... I will make brief mention of this character behind tags, and would appreciate comments regarding said character do so as well...In addition to that, for the sake of argument, I will also be ignoring a certain popular fan theory regarding a beloved character that could play into this as well, just for the sake of this post.  

In addition, as I mention I will be doing a bit of speculation regarding characters that may or may not exist/have existed, and their potential fates... hence the speculation tag, other than that enjoy the post. 


-------------


**All Lines Converge on Dany**

- The Immediate Heirs of Stannis and Tommen Baratheon

This will be the quickest to cover as it has been very established on the TV show as well as in the novels.  The immediate heir of Tommen is his sister Myrcella Baratheon, and the immediate heir of Stannis is his daughter Shireen Barathon.  Keep in mind these characters are dead in the show (as is King Stannis) so if you just want to discount the characters that have been killed you can eliminate them from the line, but as they are all still alive as of the end of ADWD I will be including them here.  

Regardless, both Myrcella and Shireen seem to be dead-ends as far as the respective lines of Stannis and Tommen go, and that seems to be correct.  Though If you want to push the issue further, Stannis would also be 2nd-in-line behind Myrcella by Tommen's reckoning, but you'd still hit a wall with Shireen after that, so where do we go from here?  The answer lies within where the Baratheons cite their right to rule..


- The Grandmother of Robert Baratheon

After Robert's rebellion the ruling of the realm was not exactly settled... the War the rebels started was not for the Throne, but to depose the Mad King, but they left one thing un-though of...what then?  How ultimately did Robert come to rule?  With the Mad King's family dead or in exile who would come to the throne?  It is a misconception to think that Robert took the throne by mere right-of-conquest alone...no he had some dragon-bloon in his veins, it is upon this he established his right to rule.

Robert's (as well as Stannis' and Renly's) grandmother was a Targaryen.. Rhaelle Targaryen, the daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen. Rhaelle was married to Lord Ormund Baratheon, and together they had one child, Steffon Baratheon, father of Robert, Stannis, and Renly.  It was based upon her that Robert Baratheon cited his right to rule at the end of his rebellion..

- What does it all mean?

So to find the heir to the Iron Throne after Shireen you'd have to work your way back to Rhaelle, and down to another branch to find an heir....which would ultimately lead to the the line descended from one of Rhaelle's brothers, King Jaehaerys II, father of the Mad King, which ultimately brings us to the Mother of Dragons... Daenaerys Targaryen... She would be the 2nd-in-line by Stannis's reckoning, 4th-in-line by Tommen's reckoning... (And ahead of the line by her own reckoning)... coincidentally this would also make Stannis first-in-line and Dany's heir by her reckoning, and Shireen 2nd-in-line.  (Assuming Dany sees Tommen as illegitimate) 

- The Targaryen wrench in the machine

For this next bit we will have to discuss a character that appears in the novels but has not, and is likely not to appear in the show, but it factors into the discussion so I will briefly cover it here.. This is behind tags to be safe. This will be the only place I mention this character, and will not factor this into later discussion.  

[SPOILERS ADWD](#b ""I am of course referring to Aegon Targaryen, styling himself as Aegon VI.. The proclaimed son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.  If he is who he says he is and was saved by Varys just prior to the sack of King's Landing, he is ahead of Dany, and would put himself ahead of her by any of the aforementioned reckonings. By his own reckoning Dany, as his aunt, would be his heir followed by Stannis and then Shireen"")

- With that being said, let's break down the individual lines of succession for what we've got this far...


**The Line of King Tommen** Heir: Myrcella Baratheon ----&gt; Stannis Baratheon ------&gt; Shireen Baratheon-----&gt;Daenerys Targaryen 

**The Line of Stannis Baratheon** Heir: Shireen Baratheon ----&gt; Daenerys Targaryen

**The Line of Daenerys Targaryen**  Heir: Stannis Baratheon---&gt;Shireeen Baratheon 

So this has all been fun, we've dealt with fact, but still the question persists....Who Then?  Well lets dive even further and attempt to answer that... we will be diving into a bit of speculation here.  Goring forward I will updating the line of succession with each step.  

---------



**The Children and lineages of King Aegon V Targaryen**

I don't really need to divide this sections into subdivisions suffice to say that the only lines that led to further children following the line of King Aegon V are ones we have already established.  Of King Aegon V's five children only 3 had children of their own.. As we have mentioned his youngest daughter Rhaelle led to the line of Baratheons we know, love and have covered in this post..  His second son (King Jaehaerys II) and eldest daughter Shaera married eachother and had Mad King Aerys, which once again leads us right back to Daenerys..  

King Aegon's eldest son Duncan forfeited his claim to the Throne for love (too long to get into here) and married Jenny of Oldstones, that marriage bore no children before his death at the Tragedy at Summerhall (which might come up again in this post..stay tuned).. King Aegon's youngest son Daeron Targaryen never married (though was betrothed to  the queen of thorns herself, Olenna Redwyne, later Tyrell), and died young in battle.   

So that was it.. we cannot examine the lines of King Aegon V any further to extend the line of succession, so we will have to go back another generation and examine King Aegon's father Maekar, as well as Aegon's siblings. 

---------




**The Children and Lineages of King Maekar Targaryen**  

Here's we delve into speculation, but specualtion based off of fact and established characters within the Lore of ASOIAF, so let's go further. 

- Maekar's eldest son, Daeron The Drunkard

To establish why a 4th son such as King Aegon V came to his crown you need to establish what happened to those ahead of  him in line to that to be so... simple answer...they died, as is with the case of Aegon's eldest brother Daeron The Drunkard, who died of a pox caught from a whore (An STD), but it is worth note for he purposes of this post to note that before he died prince Daeron did have a daughter, Vaella Targareyn, said to be kind and simple-minded she was passed over in succession when her uncle Aegon was crowned in the Great Council of 233... but she existed, as was a legitimate Targaryen princess...was she married off into another house and have children, establishing a line that could be established today?... I doubt it but the potential for it cannot be ignored, so she, or to be specific a *potential descendant* of Vaella Targaryen will be placed in line...following what's already been established... (question mark placeholders in lines of succession will be indicated in italicizes. )

**Lines of Tommen/Dany/Stannis**: Already Established---&gt; *Potential descendant of Vaella Targaryen*

- Maekar's 2nd Son: Prince Aerion Brightflame

As with his elder brother before him, Aerion Brightflame had to die for his youngest brother to take the throne... And as with his elder brother before him he did not die childless... he left a son.  Aerion married one of his cousins and had a son named Maegor, however like princess Vaella, Maegor too was passed over in the Great Council of 233 due to his very young age (He was an infant), and due to the fear that he would take after his father (Aerion was kind of crazy).. But once again, we have a true-born Targaryen prince, who would have grown up a as a prince... It is not stated whatever happened to Maegor down the road, or if he had any children of his own... It is possible, though doubtful, he could still be alive at the time of ASOIAF (He'd be in his late 60s at the time the main story starts) but he could have one or several descendants of his own potentially, and if they were true-born would certainly be on the line of succession...but as none of these potential heirs have been established let's add them to the line as another question mark... also if we follow the guidance set forward by the Great Council of 101, Maegor, and his descendants would be placed before Vaella and hers...

**Lines of Tommen/Stannis/Dany:**  Already Established---&gt;*Maegor Targaryen and his potential descendants*-----&gt; *Potential Descendants of Vaella Targaryen* 

- The 3rd son of King Maekar, and his Two Daughters: Aemon, Della, and Rhae Targaryen.

We can wrap of the last of the lineages of King Maekar under one bullet... First we tackle prince Aemon, who as you know would become our own Maester Aemon, who was offered the crown and gave it to his brother; then took to the wall where he lived out the rest of his days.... his vows as a Maester, and as a man of the Night's Watch meant he never had children of his own. 

Della and Rhae are more interesting for the topic at hand. It is not said whom, but one of the girls was betrothed their brother, Aegon... as Aegon wound up marrying outside his family that never happened.. But it is never said what became of the daughters of Maekar... But look at it this way... They are royal princesses, what allegiances could have come from marrying them into a nobel house... which most certainly would have happened.. The potential children of Della and Rhae would not be Targaryen in name, but are defiantly there to call on if we have to work back this far to find the next in the line of succession.. any descendants they had would easily be documented and well known and easy to establish the connection back to the Targaryens... and thus are put in the line..

**Lines of Tommen/Stannis/Dany:** Already Established---&gt; *Maegor Targaryen, and his potential descendants*----&gt; *Potential descendants of  Vaella Targaryen* ----&gt;*Potential descendants of Della Targaryen*----&gt;*Potential descendants of Rhae Targaryen* 

Okay that's is for all the lines that could lead from King Maekar Targaryen, which unfortunately leads us to nothing but question marks... nothing solid in ASOIAF Lore..  so...Let's back up one more generation, to Maekar's father, King Daeron II Targaryen, and work from there..


--------



**The Children and Lineages of King Daeron II Targaryen**

Fortunately for the reader, but unfortunately for the line of King Daeron II this section will be short and not require individual bullets as nothing will be added to the line here, as all his children lead to dead ends, other than King Maekar..  Maekar was Daeron II's 4th son.  His eldest son Baelor Breakspear died in a tourney mishap/accident, though did have two sons of his own... Valarr, and Matarys Targaryen, and Valarr had children as well... stillborn sons unfortunately.. Valarr and Matarys themselves died shortly after their father in a plague known as The Great Spring Sickness (An event that killed King Daeron II himself) , so as for Baelor Breakspear..... Dead Ends.  

Daeron II's 2nd son Aerys, became king (Aerys I Targaryen) after King Daeron II died, however was so enthralled with his books and studies that he never touched his wife and eventually died childless.  

Daeron II's 3rd son was wild prince Rhaegel who died during the reign of his brother Aerys... Rhaegel had 3 children however; Twins Aleora and Aelor who married eachother and both died childless, as well as a younger daughter Daenora, who married her cousin Aerion Brightflame, which we've already placed in the line... so not quite a dead end, but nothing new to add.....

So that's it for the children of Daeron II Targaryen as well as the lineages that sprout from him... and still nothing solid, nothing of which officially exists in ASOIAF Lore, so let's go back one more generation to Daeron II's father.. King Aegon IV, The Unworthy


------




**The Children and Lineages of King Aegon IV Targaryen**

- The Trueborn children of King Aegon IV

King Aegon IV had ALOT of children, but only 2 by his wife Naerys. The first being his son Daeron, later King Daeron II...which we have covered... The second child was a daughter, princess Daenerys (not to be confused with our Danerys)... And it is here where we FINALLY hit upon something solid, something that we can trace and add to our line of succession without question..   Princess Daenerys was the key figure in uniting what Aegon the Conquorer, and many other Targaryen Kings, failed to do nearly two centuries before... bring Dorne into the realm.  To achieve this Princess Daenerys was married off to Prince Maron Martell, the ruler of Dorne... their descendants rule Dorne to this day... Prince Doran Martell is part of that line, as are his own children... And yes, that means...If you work your way far back enough.. Doran Martell, followed by his children Quentyn, Trystane, and Arianne would all be placed in the line of succession for the Iron Throne.  (Or just Trystane if you go by the show)

So...  

**Lines of Tommen/Stannis/Dany:** Already Established---&gt; *Maegor Targaryen, and his potential descendants*----&gt; *Potential descendants of  Vaella Targaryen* ----&gt;*Potential descendants of Della Targaryen*----&gt;*Potential descendants of Rhae Targaryen*----&gt;Prince Doran Martell---&gt;Quentyn Martell----&gt;Trystane Martell----&gt;Arianne Martell

(also keep in mind while Arianne is ahead of her brothers for the seat at Sunspear due to Dornish customs, that does not hold true for Westerosi customs at large for the Iron Throne)

- A Plethora of Bastards

And we finally reach the end of the line, (or as far back as anyone can reasonably hope to establish).. We are not quite done yet... Many Westerosi historians among us know that the main reason why King Aegon IV was bequeathed with his nickname The Unworthy was for an action he did on his deathbed... the legitimization of every last one of his bastards... placing them officially within the line of succession, and this is where I say fuck it, I quit.. Aegon The Unworthy had a lot, dozens of bastards high and low-born alike, the guy got around.. And attempting to track the lineages of the bastards of the unworthy would be an impossible feat.  You open up the line of Daemon Blackfyre, which is said to be dead, but only in the male line (meaning that there could be more out there).  It is not said if any of the other great bastards (Aegor Bittersteel Rivers/Brynden Bloodraven Rivers/Sheria Seastar) had children, but it's possible (For Bittersteel at least).  Suffice to say that between the dozen or so named bastards, and the unknown quantity unnamed that Aegon IV produced that today there could be dozens, if not hundreds of potential (perfectly legitimate) heirs to place in our line of succession... There are many characters that have appeared though the series that have claimed to have a drop of dragon blood in them.. some within Westeros, some sellswords in Essos (A book character named Brown Ben Plumm is one of these for example).. to prove this and establish a line back to Aegon IV is pointless at this point...and this is where we will end our backtracking for today... 

So lets review and establish our final, and full line of succession to the Iron Throne of Westeros..

**Lines of Tommen/Stannis/Dany:** Already Established---&gt; *Maegor Targaryen, and his potential descendants*----&gt; *Potential descendants of  Vaella Targaryen* ----&gt;*Potential descendants of Della Targaryen*----&gt;*Potential descendants of Rhae Targaryen*----&gt;Prince Doran Martell---&gt;Quentyn Martell----&gt;Trystane Martell----&gt;Arianne Martell---&gt;*Dozens if not hundreds of potential legitimate heirs tracing back to King Aegon IV* 

So that's it, we're done here, aren't we... nope.. I have a problem with so many unknowns, so many question marks... If there are unknown descendants of this or that Targaryen prince or princess, where are they, why have they not shown up are not heard of in the novels or TV show yet?  I think I have an idea, and bear with me a moment, while I weed out the question marks..


------



**Weeding out the Question Marks....With Fire**

So how do we eliminate the question marks in our now, sizable line of succession? Although there is nothing established in ASOIAF about the unknown characters I put forward actually ever existing, I hope I have established at least that at some point, there were likely more Targaryens around (At the time of King Aegon V) than have been identified by George R R Martin.. most of which would fit somewhere on the line I have established.   Maegor Targaryen existed, as did Rhae, Della, and Vaella...something had to have happened to them... it is perfectly reasonable to think that those characters had children of their own as well....and that if they are not around in the series as it is...something had to have happened to them as well.  

What I do not think is that a forgotten Targaryen is hiding out somewhere, that some forgotten scion of Rhae Targaryen of house whatever-house-she-married-into is out there waiting in line for the Iron Throne.  What I do think is that these lines of as-of-yet un-esablished Targaryens were extinguished, with fire, in an event known as the Tragedy at Summerhall.  

For those of you who are not aware the TL;DR of the Tragedy at Summerhall (worthy of a full adding context post itself) was an incident where King Aegon V Targaryen, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Ser Duncan the Tall, Prince Duncan, and those closest to him were all killed in a massive fire in a botched attempt at hatching dragon eggs with wildfire. This was event was to be celebratory, as it was held in commemoration of the birth of King Aegon's first great-grandchild Rhaegar... If they were still alive, people like Maegor, Rhae, Vaella, and Della would have most likely been in attendance...as would their children, and grandchildren... if they existed. 

Very little is actually known about the Tragedy at Summerhall, other than it left very few witnesses alive, and the Targaryen numbers very diminished.  And this is what I think happened to those question marks I have established... they were among the dead at Summerhall... We may not know the identities of all the Targaryens that travelled to Summerhall... but we do know the sparse few who escaped that incident...and they are not among my question marks...  All the potential decendants If they existed I believe died in that fire... and have no bearing on any line of succession as it actually exists...

Speaking of which... let's get this set in stone.  A final, confirmable, line of succession for the Iron Throne of Westeros..

**FOR TOMMEN BARATHEON! :** 

Novels: Heir: Myrcella Baratheon ---&gt; Stannis Baratheon ----&gt; Shireen Baratheon --- &gt; Daenerys Targaryen ---&gt;  Prince Doran Martell---&gt;Quentyn Martell----&gt;Trystane Martell----&gt;Arianne Martell

I originally thought that Mirri Maz Durr killed him as the ""price"" for bringing Drogo back from the dead and also as a form of revenge against Drogo and the Dothraki, ""The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now"". Yet in Dae's 9th POV chapter in the book it says that Jorah killed Rhaego by dragging a pregnant Dany to the tent where Mirri Maz Durr was performing her blood magic. She had specifically warned that no living person should be there when death is there, ""Death will dance here this night, no living man must look on them"", but Jorah did it to protect her from the battle between her Khas and Drogo's blood riders.
So which is it ? Jorah or Mirri Maz Durr ? If Jorah had not brought her into the tent would Rhaego be alive right now ? Mirri Maz Dur made it seem like it was a part of her plan; ""you knew the price"", she said.

Does she intend to re-form the way Westeros is ruled? Does she plan to strip all power, in some way, from the great families of Westeros? Perhaps she plans to execute all the family members of the great houses in Westeros.

This is really weird and the fact that was in the main trailer for Season 5, tells me it is something important, probably it has something to do with the ending of the show, [S6] (#s ""maybe Jon Snow is also involved in this as Season 6 spoilers suggest he will be Jon Stark?"")

He did not return to the Eryie with Lysa and her household but instead stayed in King's Landing and was risen to the title of knight from the Lannisters, seemingly as a reward for killing Arryn. He is later killed by the Mountain in a tourney which we are lead to believe was orchestrated by the Lannisters to keep him from telling Ned Stark anything. But of course we later learn that Lysa actually killed Jon on Littlefinger's request, the Lannisters were in no way involved. Now I can see how Littlefinger would be able to organize Ser Hugh's death inorder to further convice Ned that the Lannisters were involved and I can even see how LF could also convince Lysa not to bring Hugh back to the Eryie.

do they get monthly salary from the crown?  

To me, it seems odd that everybody is vying for power in the small council. They're all lords that own land and most of their wealth comes from taxing the smallfolk that farm their land (or mining gold, taxing people at the crossing, or owning brothels and other business)
But if you're a lazy lord, why go all the way to king's landing and WORK in the governmental position? when you get no income from it? I get why Bailish want to go there, he doesn't have a lot of land and without the influence as a master of coins and investment in brothels, he'll be very poor noble. But why would someone like ned stark go there? for a volunteer work???

Verys is not a lord, so is he on a monthly payroll as the master of wisperer and live off that? 
How about bastards and second sons who become part of the small council or kingsguard? They have no sources of income if they don't get allowance from the crown. Is that why they joined?

I've always viewed Stannis as subjectively good, objectively bad. Inside is a good, honorable man who cares for his people and wants the best for the world. But outside, he's being swayed by a religion that has him convinced he's a man of prophecy and that to fulfill this much-needed prophecy, he must make sacrifices that will be difficult, and this sways him enough that he does things he would never normally do, solely based upon the belief that these acts are neccesary for the good of the realm. Davos is his rationale, Melisandre is his belief. It's not that he doesn't listen to Davos or let Davos speak, it's merely that Melisandre's counter-argument is generally ""this is a matter of faith"" or ""this must be done"" in such a way that he's convinced the decisions are SUPPOSED to look this difficult and hard. And in the end? Honestly, his sacrifices COULD be for the good of the realm. If Jon Snow is alive thanks to his daughter's sacrifice, then it wasn't for nothing. On one hand you wanna criticize the man for burning his daughter alive, on the other....? He *DID* make a difficult decision that could be key.


I've not read the books and heard plenty about how he's much better in the books, and I suppose I'm just curious as to how. Moreso however, I guess I'm confused because I've always liked Stannis as a character because of the above. There's scenes throughout the show where you can tell he's not the cold, unfeeling individual that he's often perceived to be, and you get the impression Stannis logically 100% agrees with Davos, it's just he's convinced that he needs to partake in some insane or illogical actions to fulfill a prophecy. I guess it's just always surprised me that so many people seem in the camp of ""fuck this guy"" or ""STANNIS THE MANNIS"" and few seem to be of the opinion that this drastic mix of terrible and amazing actions is what he's supposed to be like.

Am I missing something? Am I just wrong? Is it mostly related to the books and the differences made? ",69,49,False,self,,,,,

1. The Iron Bank of Braavos comes to get them because if Stannis loans, so that they can't use then.

2. They sell them to get more money for the war.

3. The ships get destroyed.

4. They use the ships to get new soldiers from the south.

From my perspective, and this comes especially when you hear the episodes and don't see them, she comes off as a total superfluous baby. She's downright self absorbed and flatout rude to anyone she doesn't consider her equal, this includes everyone short of Robb, her parents and Joffrey. With each repeat, I felt less and less bad for her ever growing worse situation and by the time I reach Ramsey again, I'm sure I'll probably be looking at her predicament with total indifference. I would never say she deserves it, but at this point, I just don't care.

Can you guys who've read the books, help me out a bit? Is Sansa books more forgiving or at least a bit more amicable? I understand much of the Ramsey work was taken from Jeyne Poole so there's less to feel sympathetic about, but is there anything else to her character development that show only peepd are missing?

PS. The reason I've gone through so many passes is because I put the show on in the background while I've been doing a complete bathroom renovation, from including gutting, electircal, plumbing and tiling.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Especially when reading the appendix with the infos about the Great Houses of Westeros there was one thing that came to my mind: Nearly every house has a history that started in some legendary ages many millenniums ago and lasted through dozens of centuries of war and intrigues. But when I look at where we are after Season 5 (I'm implying that most of the characters, who die in the show are dying in the books, too), there are not many left to carry on the history of the Great Houses.

I know that ASOIAF is describing a very special point of the history of Westeros because magic, dragons and The Others have reawakened and it's very likely that the coming winter will be something like the Long Night from he legendary ages. But still... nothing of this had a really big influence on the events in Westeros, that were happening until this point of the story. So I consider the battle for the Iron Throne and the rivalry between the different Houses as something ""normal"", that has nothing to do with the big, definitely nonrecurring events ahead. And now I'm at the point, where I'm thinking: How could it be that all the Great Houses had lasted for 8000 years and longer, when the events of GOT make it seem so easy to get killed and so very unlikely to survive beeing in a position, other may want to have for themselves, for a longer period of time (definitely not enough to raise children...). Because now the story is at a point where supposedly the BIG trouble (The Others attacking the Seven Kingdoms and the winter finally starting) is still going to happen and there is already nearly no one left to carry on the history of the Great Houses.

So what do you think for an explanation? Are those events that led to the death of so many important characters of the Great Houses simply unique and it has just something to do with all the civil wars, that had taken place in such a short period of time? And that the seven kingdoms and the Great Houses had to be redefined after all this anyway (even though there where no attack of The Others or Daenerys Targaryen ahead that will probably lead to a whole new order)? Or is it maybe just one thing GRRM didn't thought about when making up a rousing and heartbreaking story with so many dead people along the way, that it just seems unlikely that there are Houses (families) that could last over the millenniums, when all it takes is one guy like Robert Baratheon, who messes up the ""order of the Seven Kingdoms"" (with a civil war against the Targaryen and no clear heritage, which raises another civil war) in such a way, that shortly after his death all the Great Houses are laying in ruins?",94,182,False,self,,,,,

At the wedding, Lord Manderly serves up three wedding pies, and serves the slices himself, eating two slices from each of the pies. The theory is that Manderly killed the Freys and baked them into the pie. He served to make sure they ate the pies, and he ate from each of the pies. After the wedding, he tells the singer to sing them the ""Rat Cook"", a song about a cook who violated guest right, and killed the king' son, then served it to the king. The gods punished him by turning him into white rat who could only eat his own young. THE NORTH REMEMBERS.

I have watched every episode at least three times and have read the first 2 books, and my Girlfriend has watched the series with me.

We convinced our friend to start watching and we will ""guide"" her through the backstories of characters and not spoil anything.

Here are some interesting quotes from her during watching the first series:

""Is Jon gay?"" 
""I love Jon"" 
""I hope Jon gets married and has babies"" 
""Jon will find love, won't he?""
""Khal Drogo can call me his Moon and Stars!"" 
""I love Robb"" 
""Corr! Robb is sexy"" 
""I hate Joffrey"" 
""Joffrey is such a evil snake, bet he's got a small ****"" 
""I love Ned"" 
""Ned is the main guy"" 
""Ned will go to the wall with Jon and everything will be great!""
""HE DIED! HE'S THE MAIN CHARACTER!"" 
""As long as no other Starks die, I will be happy. They wouldn't kill too many people off from one family, would they?""

Our friend is very sensitive and was rocked by Ned's beheading..... I hope she is ready for the Red Wedding

This is understandable as he fits the bill of a sociopath but I don't think he should be discounted as a major thematic character in George R. R. Martins story.  Baelish has been in all books and has done nothing but increase his power and holdings.  He aspires for the throne and does so with human abilities, he organizes people, he cheats people, he plans ahead.  
Taking a step back from a emotional reaction of some of the more likeable characters, Jon Snow, Eddard Stark, etc I think this series is winding up moving away from magic.  
  I believe George R.R. Martin is showing a last battle where magically creatures will be leaving the world,  Wargs (Stark family), dragon born, etc are remanents of the past.   I think you may be surprised that Petyr Baelish may end up King Of Westeros.  This series will likely have magic and dragons up to a final battle of sorts and then will depart from the world, much like LOT and other fantasy narratives.   Petry Baelish is showing that human abilities in some ways exceed those of ""magic"" and even though he represents a dark side of humanity it is one that is efficient, successful and powerful.

Jon Snow was alive, although his eyes would stray from Wight like to human while he was talking, but it seemed that things had died down, the Boltons where gone, The North was at peace again. They were in Winterfell. Jon, Sansa, Littlefinger, Tourmund and Rickon, where discussing how they should deal with the threat from the south (it was rather ambiguous) and man the Wall. Jon and Sansa seemed at ends to each other, Sansa not trusting her now resurrected Targaryen cousin. 

Then it cut too the Wall. It was wide shot similar to the view of the wall from Moles Town, in fact it probably was Moles Town. It was night, and the moon light was twinkling off the now dark and seemingly abandoned Wall. Everything was quiet and still, peaceful. Then, echoing off from somewhere behind the wall, a resonating high pitched screech was heard, then it fell silent again, and then suddenly a rumble was heard, and a segment of the wall just shattered, flinging bits of Ice thousands of feet into the air. People from Moles Town ran out to see what the noise was, clattering and clobbling. Their murmurs where deafened by the almighty thunderous roar of the Wall coming down. Then through the gaping wound in the last line of defence from the Others... came the Others, an army bigger than any imaginable, but they weren't marching in song, there was no orders being bellowed. Like rain rolling down a window they drifted silently towards Moles Town. People began too panic, many ran but many where stuck where they stood, knowing they where witnessing the end. The wind began to howl and snow began to fall. Fires extinguished and animals fled. Then the slaughter began. 

I remember watching the leader of the White Walker army, (The Nights King?) walking through Moles Town as Wights and White Walkers savaged the population. A mother told her boy to run, while the screeches of the Wights grew louder. She turned to see the Nights King silently walk towards her, unarmed, his icy stare not breaking from her panicked glare. The boy ran as she picked up a knife to face the threat. Tears running down her cheek. She was slowly backing towards a fire when a Wight jumped out from a Hut and cut her down, her screams made the boy stop, and call out for his mum. Just then, a wight jumped out to savage the boy, but it stopped, just out of reach, snapping at his face. 

The Nights King raised a hand, and the Wight walked away. The boy, staring at his dead mother, now twitching, was approached by the Nights King. His tears froze on his face as the leader of the White Walkers knelt down to his level. The boy could not stare at this otherworldy being, but as he turned his head away, the Nights King tried to maintain his gaze, turning his head too. The boys mother now reanimated, and joined the undead legion. Mole's Town was now silent, the boy being the last human alive. Behind the Nights King stood White Walkers and Wights alike. 

The boys whimpering broke the silence. The Nights King looked at the boy, who was staring at his undead mother, stood just behind the Nights King. The King turned to face the mother, than turned back to the boy with a cold smirk on his face. He then whispered one word to the boy. 

""Stark"". 

The boy raised one arm, wildly shaking, and pointed out of Moles Town. The Nights King nodded to a White Walker, mounted on an undead horse. It let out a dry, cold rasp and the Wights began to move. 

The wights moved out of Mole Town, leaving just the boy, the Nights King and a group of White Walkers. The boys whimpering was stopped when the Nights King placed his pale blue hands on his face. The boy looked at the King for the first time, and his eyes glazed over with frost. The boy dropped to the floor dead, and the Nights King walked away, leaving the boys body laying still in the snow, then silence. 


I am a vivid dreamer and every now and then I have these crazy indepth dreams that feel so real, its crazy. I feel like everyone here enjoys reading anything to do with Game of Thrones no matter how silly even if its from a dream, so I hope you guys enjoyed that and roll on the Season 6 trailer! 

TL;DR:

Vivid dreamer, dreamt of watching the Season 6 finale. The Wall falls, Mole Town is attacked, Nights King asks where he can find the Starks. End.

But at the same time, Catelyn is hardly a neat fit for this sort of position either. By all appearances, she was preparing to leave Robb's army and return to Winterfell right before he sends her south to treat with Renly, and unlike an ""official"" Hand, she does not appear to have any direct authority to act on King Robb's behalf in his absence. (Even before she undermines her own position by freeing Jaime behind Robb's back).

Throughout his campaign, Robb consults with any number of his bannermen on matters of tactics and strategy. Roose Bolton appears to be the one whom he consults with the most, but Roose also doesn't really fit the role of a Hand because he is not constantly at Robb's side. When Robb moves the bulk of his army into the Riverlands to join with the Tully forces, Roose Bolton is tasked with occupying Harrenhal, while Edmure &amp; Blackfish Tully largely take Roose's place for the time being as Robb's top generals/tacticians.",6,4,False,self,,,,,

I decided it was time to finally start watching to kinda get the full picture of the going ons and....well, to be honest, I'm a tad disappointed. Not massively so, otherwise I wouldn't be here typing this up, but just surprised that there were parts where the pacing of the story or some of the transitions or some of the plotlines felt a little weird or weak, and now I'm wondering if perhaps this is due to time constraints (AKA perhaps the books flesh things out better and explain some of the oddities, but TV had no time for the full explanations) or if perhaps Season 1 - being the first season before the rest, when the show undoubtedly gained a massive following and more sponsorship for production - is a little weak in that regard.


What I'm referring to? Little things that just seemed unavoidable, or had no real explanation about why or how we came to this. First example would be Catelyn capturing Tyrion. Cat takes Tyrion, a guy rides down to warn Ned, and Ned, in his infinite wisdom, takes full credit for it despite no involvement. Genius plan, Ned. The Lannisters - the people you're working with on the Royal Council and in the courts - *surely* won't take offense or perceive it as an act of aggression from you if you take credit. Telling them honestly that you don't know why and to simply be given a chance to speak with your wife? Nonsense! That's stupid! 

  That's a major plot point that drives the story forward, and it just felt very weak to me. It felt like a fully avoidable situation, and yet it's all blown tremendously out of proportion because Ned is a total idiot and somehow saw fit to take credit for a ""crime"" of sorts that he didn't do. Am I missing something? Like would Cat have been subject to some severe punishment had he not taken credit or something? Or is this really ""Ned is so unbelievably flawed that he allowed this situation to explode?"" Cause if it's the latter, I'm a bit disappointed in how the conflict arose.


The next biggest one has to be Dany with her dragon eggs. Dany's an idiot, gets her beloved husband killed, she's devastated, and then *seemingly for no reason at all,* gets this inkling it would be a brilliant fucking idea to crawl onto a pyre fire. Wtf? Really? Like she didn't have a dream that gave her a vision? She didn't read somewhere that this is how the eggs are hatched, or somewhere along the line confirmed fully for herself that she's immune to fire? I mean it was briefly covered, but seemed like a drastic jump between ""huh, my hands aren't burnt"" and ""DON'T WORRY GUYS I CAN BE ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND BE FINE AND FOR SOME REASON I THINK BOTHERING WITH THE ATTEMPT IS WORTH THE EFFORT.""

Again, did I just miss something? Did I forget a key scene or...? Is Dany just really that batshit crazy that she gets an inkling that warming herself on the fire is a brilliant idea so she did it? As I said, the pacing and the explanations driving this story are what just seemed to fall apart for me.


Overall? I mean it works. The show *still* seems to hold itself and it's plotlines together, it's just those two scenes in particular are cases where a character seemed to act ridiculously irrational with no explanation as to why. I mean Ned's case? If we were told ""Cat would be guilty of X and charged with *insert severe punishment here* if acting on her own,"" but Ned as King of the Hand can be guilty of the same act without it being a crime, then ok, suddenly Ned has a great motivation for taking credit. At most this seems very vaguely implied, but nothing is done to provide any details or support that theory. (again, unless I missed/forgot something or the books have the answer) With Dany, even if the motivation was as simple as a vision in a dream, then we at least know she has a motivation. Instead, one minute she's mourning her loss, the next she seems convinced climbing up on that fire is a brilliant idea. Like I said, the pacing of the story is just very weird to me. The story transitions us from A to B, but does little to explain how those dots got connected.



Am I alone in this opinion? Did I derp and forget important details reinforcing these scenes? Do the books hold more lengthy, unabridged answers regarding motivations here? And in regards to any other seasons I'm about to watch, are there any parts you guys remember where you felt the pacing or transitions were a little off, or is that solely a thing from Season 1?

Any ideas what their primary objectives, goal or motivation is? Knowing George R.R. Martin it can't possibly be as simple as ""conquest for the sake of conquest"". I've always been surprised that both in the books and by fans people seem to just assume that they want to conquer. But knowing them as the more complex beings that they are it can't be that simple. That the Night king simply wants to ""take over Westeros, just because"" falls short imo.  
  
My theory is that maybe they are seeking out some magical artifact or powerful magical site in the south for some purpose. I know that's not a lot to go on but I was hoping someone here might have some more interesting theories.  
  
In conclusion: White walkers and the night king invading the south just to conquer for the sake of conquering feels like an out of place and too mundane overall goal and motivation for them and I was hoping someone has any ideas to what their true purpose with an invasion could be.

Give it a read if you've got the time, and I hope it changes some people's opinions about the terrible thing Stannis Baratheon did in the 9th episode of Season 5.


______________________________________________________


Stannis sacrificing Shireen is perfectly in line with his character. You must understand what he thinks is at stake here, it's not just: ""Oh no I'll lose my army and Boltons will continue to be dicks so I can't get the throne"". Stannis' words prior to the burning tell us all we need to know. Stannis believed that he was the chosen one, the Prince that was Promised, and that he was the only one who could stop the Others.

Stannis loved his daughter, more than anything in the world, and Stephen Dillane displayed the pain of the choice he had to make very well. Stannis doesn't instantly agree to it because he clearly doesn't want to do it. Condemning his only beloved child a horrible, slow and painful death? Of course he doesn't want to do that. But he does it anyways, because he believes that if he doesn't, billions of innocents will suffer, and the Long Night will end everything. Sacrificing the one thing he holds dear to spare the realm from such horror truly makes him the Mannis, so much more than being ballsy in a battle.

&gt;*""I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so long as I am the king, I have a duty  If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark  Sacrifice  is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice."" - King Stannis Baratheon, ASOS 63*

But no, fuck Dumb&amp;Dumbr such character assassination, im so fucking done with this piece of crap show, stannis would never do this, he would win the throne and continue to be cool and everyone lived happily ever after, fuck D&amp;D for ruining the best character ever blabla hurr durr im a book purist im such a genius, these show is so fucking dumb blablabbla

Yes, D&amp;D fucked up on many occasions, but this wasn't one of them. If people aren't capable to understand good writing for what it is, no wonder that the show mainly delivers poor scripts and cheesy lines these days (insert bad pussy quote).

Isn't this a core point of the ASOIAF saga? Good people can't always be honorable and are often forced to make difficult choices that go against their morals. Eddard Stark was offered a choice like this, he chose the honorable path and look where it got him. Not only did he lose his own head, but he let the Seven Kingdoms slide into warfare. George Martin set this concept up very well so far, yet we bash D&amp;D for following it?",32,12,False,self,,,,,

* 1) The scene begins with Princess Shireen of House Baratheon playing with the wooden stag Davos gave her. This is the first warning sign of ""this is going to hurt"" for the audience: camera focuses on the stag in her hand and there's a fire burning in the background. 

* 2) Enter Stannis, we learn she keeps reading the history of the Dance of the Dragons (Stannis must have failed history because he didn't know what that was about)  Dance of the Dragons- a tale where people fight over the control of the throne (see also: war of the five kings) and ultimately it's not worth it. 

&gt; Stannis: ""If you had to choose... between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?.

 
* Clueless Stannis is clueless, can't see his daughter's point, still fixated in the politics of it all. 


* Shireen (the voice of wisdom) wouldn't have chosen either. Shireen is very wise for her age and (much like another loved almost surely undead character) is able to rise beyond petty issues and see the whole picture of situations. GRRM seems to enjoy writing children who are way smarter than the adults they share with. 

* This is where I believe it gets really interesting: I think this scene gets across one of the main points of GRRM's narrative - **DUTY IS KINDA DUMB** I know, I know, bare with me ok? First let's look at the dude himself: George backed out of Vietnam because he didn't believe in that war. He (like many) didn't buy into the whole ""it's our duty to be here for our country"" narrative and decided it wasn't for him. Now back to fiction:

* Like many of you have noticed over the course of many, many threads, Stannis Baratheon is a dude of DUTY, but also a man of desire. He claims he didn't want the throne but he's sure as hell done everything he can -even burning his freaking daughter for you show watchers- to get it. It's getting hard to believe ""duty"" is the only thing that drives him. 

* Even if duty was his sole motive, we get told later that burning Shireen lead to half his army nopeing the fuck out, Selyse's suicide and his ultimately (maybe) demise. So what good is duty (or ambition, or both) for? In the words of Aemon Targaryen: 

&gt; *What is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms  or the memory of a brother's smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.* (JON VIII, AGOT) 

I know i'm pretty much giving Stannis all the heat for this, but can you think of another character who made dumb decisions for the sake of honour and duty? Eddie and Robbie Stark might ring a bell. 

&gt; Stannis: ""Sometimes a person has to choose, sometimes... the world forces his hand, if a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all. He must fullfill his destiny..."" 

And Stannis repeats his own propaganda because he's trying to convince himself this is the right thing. That DUTY actually is a thing, that he's saving something bigger than himself by doing bad things like killing people. But what if he's wrong? The story is pointing us to agree that duty and honour and *the Lysa Arryn of chairs* are meaningless compared to the joy of just *living* (Which is Jon's point: he tries to convince people of this because he would like to avoid the army of the dead messing shit up). 

TL;DR: 1 The story portrays GRRM's own views on war and history itself: war is messy, war is deadly, war is necessary sometimes (see: kill Others to survive) but not often. 
2 While Shireen isn't dead on the books and Stannis' story is quite different also, this add-on to the show (which got viewers EXTREMELY upset) is actually pretty cool.

P.S: I loved Shireen too

We've struggled through the show thus far with Russian subtitles scrounged from the web - these are quite often not easy to find or even not available. (In fact, I've only seen one season of official discs that have Russian subs.)

Ahead of the coming season, we're going to re-watch the whole run to-date and I thought I'd try and make things a lot easier for her by using some additional material, especially visual stuff. For context, if any native English-speakers have read the Russian classics, it can be hard to keep track of the characters because they tend to have 4 names that can sound similar. Of course GoT is notorious for having tons of characters, and you have people like Bran who can disappear for many episodes on-end.

So I thought that I'd put some stuff on the walls, whip out some handy cheat-sheets for watching-time, etc. Things like maps and family trees are great (and easy to find), but I'm going to really put some effort into this.

As such, I thought I'd petition your collective wisdom. Without taking up TOO much space, what would you consider are great pieces for an ESL person to help them keep track of all the myriad info blowing past us every episode? Obviously, keep in mind that as an intermediate English-speaker, just massive tomes of text might not help that much.

955,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-1-21,2016,1,21,5,41watu,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] Alliser Thorne,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/41watu/all_spoilers_alliser_thorne/,[deleted],1453323006,"Was anyone else genuinely surprised by the showrunners' decision to give Alliser Thorne a direct role in Jon's assassination? (The first one to put a knife in him, no less).

Since his very first appearance, Alliser had been set up as an antagonist to the likable Jon Snow, (arguably the closest thing the series has to a central protagonist) but not one entirely without redeeming qualities. Certainly, he was a bitter, pig-headed man, but was also shown to be a capable and brave warrior who had more than earned his stripes over the years. (The fact that his only real ""crime"" that sent him to the Watch was fighting on the losing side of a civil war isn't really emphasized in the show, but it does add some context as to why he's so embittered).

When Janos Slynt reappears at Castle Black, he becomes an interesting foil to Thorne that helps further develop his character. They are both antagonists of Jon Snow, but Janos, by contrast, is shown to be shamelessly opportunistic and cowardly. This is best illustrated at the Battle of Castle Black, but a less prominent example might be his agreeing to Janos' plan to indirectly eliminate Jon Snow. He agrees to send Jon after the mutineers at Craster's knowing that the odds will be against them, but he's not willing to simply have Jon ""whacked"" without sending him on a legitimate mission, however dangerous it may be.

Thorne is understandably bitter over the results of the election, but dutifully accepts Jon's ""consolation prize"" of being named First Ranger; one gets the sense that Thorne wouldn't have publicly lashed out the way Janos did, even if he had been given a less dignified assignment. And, of course, he's not about to stick his neck out for Janos after he publicly insults and defies the legitimately elected Lord Commander.

Anyone who knew about the upcoming attempt on Jon's life from the books could see Olly's role in all this from a mile away, but Thorne's previously law-abiding nature made his direct involvement a bit of a surprise, at least for me. Thorne would obviously benefit from a sudden vacancy in the Lord Commander spotgiven that he had been the runner-up in the last electionbut I wouldn't have thought it something he would a direct hand in. More likely to be something he either subtly encouraged and/or didn't get in the way of, and he might struggle with the morals/ethics of this in the aftermath of Jon's assassination.

But now, any path he might have once had to redemption is almost certainly closed off, despite the fact that he could have become an interesting and unlikely ally to Jon somewhere down the line. All I can figure is that, like many other characters in S5 whose paths deviated significantly from the books, Thorne really doesn't have much of a role left to play from here on out.

He had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf stalking silent at his side. One skinchanger can always sense another The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught - Varamyr Sixskins (1st chapter of ADwD).

cant be more obvious then that but heres some extra stuff to ease some of your minds.

when Ghost appeared beside him, his warm breath steaming in the cold The taste of blood filled Jons mouth. and he knew that Ghost had killed that night - Jon ADwD page 145 (3rd Jon chapter).

Your wall is a queer place, but these is power here, if you will use it. Power in you [Jon], and this beast [Ghost]. You resist it, and that is your mistake. Embrace it. Use it - Mel to Jon ADwD page 380 (6th Jon chapter).

Jon smelled Tom Barleycom before he saw him. Or was it Ghost who smelled him? Of late, Jon sometimes felt as if he and the direwolf were one - Jon ADwD (7th Jon chapter).

AND AS FOR PROOF THAT WARGS CANT DIE SIMPLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.

When a mans [wargs] flesh dies, his spirit lives on inside the beast -  Varamyr Sixskins (1st chapter of ADwD).

The flames crackled softly, and in their cracking she heard the whispered name Jon Snow Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again - Mel ADwD.

In it, the main character is a young girl name Adara, and her adventures with an ice dragon. We have reason to believe that Adara is in Westeros, even though it is never specifically mention, because she mentions the ""Lands of always winter"", a place in the very far north, past the wall, where it is always cold and snowy, without a pause. Adore is a unusual child. According to the book, when her mother was giving birth to her, the cold crept in, past the great fire her father had made, and left it's mark on Adara. For some reason, she is always very cold. She can stay in the snow for hours without feeling cold, and she can touch animals very sensitive to heat without melting them. She has a very close, secret relationship with an ice dragon, an animal extremely sensitive to heat, and she rides it around lot.

Now think of the last words in the chapter in which Jon Snow dies(?). *""The last thing he felt was the cold.""* Now imagine this, Jon Snow is resurrected by Melisendre, after the Night's Watch finds that his body does not burn because he is blood of the dragon (Please GRRM), however, when he wakes up, he finds that he has features like Adara, he is very cold, and he does not feel the cold anymore. Not bound to the Night's Watch because of his death, he goes beyond the wall, finds an ice dragon, and, like Dany, proceeds to kick ass and be awesome while riding on a dragon.

It would be pretty awesome.

By the way, in the story when the ice dragon dies, it melts, and leaves behind a pool that is always cold. I have heard that Catelyn said there was a pool like this in Winterfell. Do you think that there is a connection?

Also, Adara is very cold, has blond hair, and blue eyes. Remind you of anyone? That's right, is this a possible connection/reference to the 13^th commander of the Night's Watch, the beautiful girl he found, and the atrocities that they committed? Who knows.

Tywin (I know she tries to get him later, but realistically he should have been target number one straight off the bat). Tywin dies, Robb's chances of winning the war against the Lannisters goes up roughly 1000% since all the other Lannisters bar Tyrion are shown to be pretty much incompetent (something Arya knows because she is Tywin's cupbearer). 2. Joffrey. He is the enemy KING, she knows exactly what he is capable of, and he has her sister captive doing gods-know-what to her. Both of these are no-brainers, and in my opinion the writers should have come up with a reason she couldn't choose either of them (for example in the books she is with Vargo Hoat rather than Tywin at Harrenhal, so at least it makes sense that his name wouldn't occur to her).

2.  Why did Sansa agree to marry Ramsey, all I got is that it would be for vengeance.  Sansa's character is not one to read in between the lines so her understanding of what little finger was implying was out of character.

I would say that the key difference between Ned and Robb and pretty much any other character in the Game of Thrones universe is that GRRM chose to make them pay for their choices. I genuinely can't think of a single character that hasn't made a foolish or daring choice. Tyrion has done dumb shit. Daenerys has done dumb shit. Arya has done dumb shit. Davos has done dumb shit. Jon Snow has done dumb shit (and paid for it in the same way his family did). They've just not paid for them because GRRM has decided that they shouldn't yet. I really can't think of a character that hasn't made a foolish/risky decision within their world that couldn't have easily paid for it.

All in all I just feel like Robb Stark especially gets the shitty end of the stick when people say, ""it was his own fault!"" because not a single person in his group knew that something like that could happen, otherwise they would have been much more precautious. It's extremely easy to look back on an event already knowing what happened and point to clues as to why something shouldn't have been done, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20.",62,67,False,self,,,,,

I am pretty sure i missed something that explained the captain that betrayed his other two captains is the same guy that helped Arya kill those men, am i right?
I really did not expect the Robb and Catelyn to get killed at this time, because of the theme of Dragon vs. Stag vs. Lion vs. Wolf, but perhaps i am wrong.
Was i the only one fooled by Jons acting while he was with the wildlings?
I hate all the Lannisters except Tyrion, and Jamie, i only half hate Tywin.
I started to feel bad for Theon near the end of the season.
I very much dislike Jojen.
The scene of Theon with the to women before he is castrated has to be the most explicit in the show.
I hated Argus Flinch, i hate Walder Frey, must be the actor that brings people to hate him even more.

-King
-Queen
-Little Finger
-Ilyn
-Ramsey
-Red Woman
-More but i can't think

Then all in one fell swoop both his purpose and his hope were gone.

While I fully believe hes really a blackfyre in disguise, that doesn't stop me from thinking he'll sit on the throne at one point before the series ends. The end of ADWD has an interesting twist, where [book spoiler](#b ""Varys kills Grand Maester Pycelle (a character alive in the show) and then (presumably??) kills Kevin Lannister."") The motivation of this is to cause tension between the Tyrells and the Lannisters, so that once the fighting is done, Young Gryff can take the throne. 

Now we have already seen a great deal of casting leaking, where the great tension between the Tyrells and Lannister will occur for season 6. The question is, what will lead to this? While show watchers think Aegon will be cut to make the plot less confusing, I feel omitting him will vastly change the story for Kings Landing, especially if Aegon does become the king. 

That said, I'm leaning towards Jon Connington being cut, due to the greyscale arc given to Jorah. However, cutting Jon should not greatly impact the show, as many feel Jon will surely die anyways.

Tyrion and Varys are still overseas in the show, and thus can still meet with Aegon. Aegon is a huge part of Varys character and end game intentions overall. Keep in mind, the show constantly swaps the chronology of events, even after it appeared like they cut the event entirely. (Such as Sam meeting with Bran).

Ultimately I feel Aegon is critical to Danys plot, as she will have to deal with the prophecies of the ""False/mummers"" dragon coming true, and ultimately remove him from the throne. This seems like too much of a major plot point for the show to deviate from.

So whats the consensus? Is there another reason that will cause the Tyrells and Lannisters great tension? Will Aegon fail to sit on the throne in the books, making him reasonable to cut from the show?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

That previous thread is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3yy7b8/all_spoilerstheory_myth_and_monsters_in_asoiaf/) 

I thought I'd add to it. So here it is, a much shorter version. To briefly sum up my intention here, I think that GRRM uses a lot of old monsters, myths and fairy tales (usually disguised) in his works, and their themes and/or narratives can be possible predictors for his intentions in ASOIAF.  So, this is still theory based, but approaching from an unusual angle. If you didn't read my first post, give it a shot if you like this, or maybe read it before. 

Both of these are based in fairy tales, rather than the classic myth and monsters thing I did before. 

**Daario/Bluebeard 
Something obvious I missed in my last post is Daario. This is because I haven't read the books, just watched the show, and wiki'd. I totally forgot Daario in the books has a blue beard, and when I remembered this, it became super obvious. Not a lot of people are familiar with the story of Bluebeard, so I'll sum it up quickly-- Bluebeard is an old fairy tale about a naive girl who is proposed to by a strange neighbor. She immediately notes a particular characteristic-- his beard is blue. This is not all she notes-- he had many wives who have all disappeared under strange circumstance. Her immediate instinct is to distrust him. However, he manages to charm his way into her favor, and she eventually accepts his advances, only to realize quickly that he is a sadistic man (she finds his Bloody Chamber, a room filled with torture devices and his dismembered former wives,) and she realizes her initial impressions should have been enough to signal to her that she should have avoided him. Many of the features of Bluebeard share striking similarities to Dany and Daario's relationship-- most obviously the blue beard. Dany also ignored something major about Daario-- he dispatched the heads of the Second Sons the moment he found an opportunity for possible advancement. He charmed his way into her cabinet shortly after. In other words, just as in Bluebeard, Dany has been given quite enough to question the nature of Daario, but has been charmed into believing otherwise. I think this should give us some serious pause when we consider Daario's possible aims. We should also maybe be worried for Jorah, out alone with Daario, at Daario's insistence.

** Three Eyed Raven/The Erl-King
Once again, not a widely known fairy tale, so a quick summary. The Erl-King is a mythical forest creature with heavy ties to the fairy. Particularly, to children. The Erl-King draws in, and ensnares children to feast on. Sometimes instead of children, young girls. In some translations, his name is instead the Alder-King-- he has a heavy associatiom with trees. He is the inspiration for our modern day riddling bridge troll.
This is potentially very bad news for Bran. He has been drawn to a tree-related mythical forest creature, with a connection to fairy-like children-- Bran, Meera, and the child-like Hodor have all been drawn to Blood Raven, all of them, children, which is the Erl-King's snack of choice. It might be very unlikely that he has their best interests at heart-- he may simply have been fishing for seers to consume. 

Anyways, that's all for now. I might have something else later, but comment if you think there's something to it.",3,20,False,self,,,,,

Initially, the series portrays Jamie and Cersei's incestuous relationship in a very negative tone, however I feel the language and tone towards this has softened throughout the progress of the series. Jaime's tagline on this topic becomes ""You don't choose who we love."" said to both Brienne and Myrcella. Jaime's inner conflict about this socially unacceptable relationship is conveyed strongly though his dialogue with Cersei, ""You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?"". His protective stance of her is also somewhat chivalrous (maybe admirable?) in his threatening exchange with Loras Tyrell, ""If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."" By the end of season 5, Jaime experiences (albeit briefly) the thrill of actually being a recognized father to Myrcella - also portrayed in a positive tone.

My question is, does this portrayal make us, as viewers, sympathetic to Jaime's plight of loving (eros) his sister? The use of language like ""don't get to choose who we love"" sounds undeniably similar to language used at times to defend homosexuality in modern times. 

Surprisingly, trends in modern porn consumption correspond accordingly. ""A report by leading multimedia-adult-content providers GameLink.com revealed a 178 percent average increase in the consumption of ""family role-play porn"" between October 2014 and January 2015."" from: http://www.vice.com/read/why-is-incest-porn-so-popular-332

What does this say about our society? Is this fictional relationship between Jaime and Cersei simply a reflection of a new underlying cultural acceptance of incestuous relationships?

1130,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-1-24,2016,1,24,1,42bkg2,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers][Theory] My Jon Snow Theory I'd like Disproven,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/42bkg2/all_spoilerstheory_my_jon_snow_theory_id_like/,A_nbd_I,1453567805,"I find its easier to disprove theories than prove them. When it comes to the show it is not possible to prove a theory until the show actually ""proves it"". So I am looking for arguments against my theory. More reasons are also welcome!

If you are not caught up with the show spoilers ahead!

Here's my theory

Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna Stark and Robert Baratheon. Before Lyanna is kidnapped by the mad king she gets pregnant with Robert Baratheons son (they are set to get married/ Robert feels great love towards her). She then has her son in Kings Landing. If the Mad King kept her alive for almost 2 or 3 years its safe to assume he would keep her son alive as well. Finally when Ned stark reaches his kidnapped sister he finds here dying and promises to keep Jon safe. Lyanna knew that once Robert became king the Lanistars would want Jon dead as he would be the next heir to the throne. So Ned Stark takes him back to Winterfell and claims Jon is his bastard child.

Reasons (Assuming a correct theory)

- ""You are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."" Ned Stark says this to Jon as he is headed to the Wall to serve in the Nights Watch. By my blood he means they are related. Instead of Jon being Ned's bastard, Jon is actually his nephew.

- ""Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Eddard Stark: Nor will I."" Robert Baratheon never really saw who Ned was with during the war. There's no proof Ned was with another women. Most people actually question it or comment about how Ned is too honorable to be with another women. (Stannis, Jaimie, etc) Let's not forget Neds only fault and reason for dying was his honor.

- When Robert is dying he has Ned write his final decree. King Robert says Joffrey is to be King but Ned writes ""rightful heir"" by which he means Jon Snow. ""No he doesn't, he means Gendry!"" you say ""why else is Gendry in the show?"" Yes, before the King dies Ned Stark finds out about many of Roberts Bastards but Gendry's story line is to help Ned figure out Joffrey is the son of incest, he helps Arya's story arc, and etc. Many people seem to think he was a random character but really he played a large part already. He doesn't have to be king to give him ""a stronger role"" in the series. I would be ok with his character line ending in a rowboat, but thats just an opinion.

- What about ""The Seed is strong!"" Jon Snow should have Black Hair however Jon's traits are ""Very Stark"". Its true that GRRM places a lot of reliance on genes when it comes to families. (Lanisters: Blonde Targaryens: Silver Hair and Purple eyes Baratheons: Black Hair) But Jon does have Dark Brown Hair which could be the result of codominance. A dominant gene for brown hair and a dominant Gene for black hair would result in Jon's dark brown hair.

Really these ""proofs"" are only useful by not disproving my theory. It would be nice to have more reasons my theory could work or a reason why it doesn't work.

Edit: Before I forget, I know about the R+L=J  Theory(rhaegar and lyanna are Jon's parents). Same as my theory, it is valid and hasn't really been disproved. As a fan of the show however I chose my theory because Jon (Ice) and Dany (Fire) will rule together not fight against one another (A Song of Fire and Ice). I guess they could rule together as brother and sister but I prefer they rule together as king and queen, without incest.",49,0,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to share the theory one more time before Season 6 kicks off. This is a **total theory** -- I covered everything I could think of, for all the realms, meant to be a comprehensive guide for the remaining seasons. Let me know what you think!

1 - Why is everyone worried about the threat of white walkers when there is a giant ice wall protecting them? I highly doubt the white walkers are able to climb it, so why is everyone so scared of them?

2 - What is it about winter that makes them seem to ONLY come during winter? They seem to be doing pretty well in the summer time, why wait for winter? And does this mean that warmer areas such as Dorne and King's Landing will not be affected by the white walkers?

I mean everyone loves a protagonist, a hero, someone who overcomes the odds to defeat evil. Well we know in GoT/ASOIF that a central character would kind of go against what Martin is building up. With the like of past main ""protagonists"" being shockingly killed off with no pay off (Ned and Robb) it leaves the door open to should there actually be a main hero in this series?

On the one hand, a hero who defeats evil is clich and incredibly predictable. Sure you get a great pay off, but you always feel safe and the story is bound to them. So what then? Well you take a Tolkien route and take the complete opposite of a hero and build their character through courage and overcoming the odds. Tolkien disguises his heroes amongst a cast of strong characters, but it's pretty clear that Bilbo and Frodo respectively are the central characters in their respective novels. Even this route has became clich of sorts, so what next?

This is where this series comes in and where the entire story is area crossroads of sorts (although George has probably got the end game figured out). Does the series end with multiple protagonists each doing their own bit to conquer evil, or does he focus on one central character like a Jon Snow rumored to be this heroic figure of Azor Ahai reborn? The series already has a seller roster of characters deep water that backstory and full of intrigue and mystery. So the obvious answer at the moment is that there is no ""hero"" and that this ""three headed dragon"" will save the day. But is that any better or less clich than one hero? I can't imagine how forced it would seem for three massive characters to team up Power Ranger style and all of a sudden win. What I'm really getting at here is that, is it really any better to have multiple heroes working together or one? Everyone always points out that one hero is clich and boring, but this three headed dragon end game seems just as clich on my opinion.

So your thoughts: Multiple protagonists working together, or one rising above all?

There were some similar extensions in the Chrome store, but they had mixed reviews.

The idea came to my mind after I had seen this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsTVnZm9hFg) 

In the books Robb marrried to Jeyne Westerling she may be was in love with him but her family is plotting with Tywin. it's was different in the show Robb was married because he was so horny and he had to choose between a frey ugly girl he didn't love or the hot nurse he in love with , many fans (me) find it a really silly love story and Robb just lost the war because of such a selfish decision . 

If Talisa is actually a Lannister spy and Robb is a victim of a lannister scheme it will make Talisa alittle more interesting than being the westerosi-nurse-version of Cinderella , and It's great that D&amp;D keep in their mind the marriage plan the lannisters made to downfall Robb like in the books .

many things to proof this theory makes sense :

- when she first appear she was nursing the Lannister soldiers and she was angry because Robb fought the poor soldiers , many fans find it really silly like ""bitch please he is fighting his enemies""

- She claimed that she is a noble girl from Volantis , and she killed in the wedding , how come her family didn't revenge for their daughter till now (Season 5) !! Or may be she was lying and she is not from Volantis !!
the letter Talisa was writing to her mom , what if it was actually a spying messages to Tywin ??

- she was killed in the wedding ,why? because she is carrying the new king in the north or may be it is kinda (you had served your purpose we don't need you now bye)

- Roose Bolton , why he was always get in the time wen Robb ans Talisa was almost about to kiss or they are kissing (Spying ? or he was making sure that Talisa is playing her role ? )

I think this theory is may be 50% right and I actually like this theory ,in season 6 we will see a Red wedding revenge so may be somehow they will state that Talisa was playing in the Lannister side , it will make Robb's death more tragic .

the only hole of this theory that D&amp;D are possibly don't think this way.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Tyrion IX

Jon IX

Catelyn XII

Daenerys X

This week, sons are made to feel inferior, smallfolk are sentenced to terrible fates, vows are broken and then renewed, Robb is deemed DA KING IN DA NORF, and Dany finally becomes the Mother of Dragons. It's an emotional episode that covers some of the most well-written chapters from the book, and it features some extremely poor attempts at Scottish accents. And I mean like, embarrassingly bad. Horrifically bad. Imagine someone who's never heard a Scottish accent waking up from a 30 year long coma and trying to imagine what Scottish people sound like while also trying to use their legs for the first time in three decades. It's that bad.

[Here's the link to another link to the link. Lots of links and such](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relationship-between-Jon-Snow-and-Sansa-Stark-like)

What I find most interesting is how it points out that Summer hasn't been too kind to Sansa, and that she may find her new life in Winter. It's also interesting how similar the two of them are, despite being the seemingly least alike of the Stark children. What do you guys think?",3,2,False,self,,,,,

I am pretty sure i missed something that explained the captain that betrayed his other two captains is the same guy that helped Arya kill those men, am i right? I really did not expect the Robb and Catelyn to get killed at this time, because of the theme of Dragon vs. Stag vs. Lion vs. Wolf, but perhaps i am wrong. Was i the only one fooled by Jons acting while he was with the wildlings? I hate all the Lannisters except Tyrion, and Jamie, i only half hate Tywin. I started to feel bad for Theon near the end of the season. I very much dislike Jojen. The scene of Theon with the to women before he is castrated has to be the most explicit in the show. I hated Argus Flinch, i hate Walder Frey, must be the actor that brings people to hate him even more.
My hate/kill List -King -Queen -Little Finger -Ilyn -Ramsey -Red Woman -More but i can't think
When it comes to Daenerys, when she gets to westeros, i feel like the only thing that might slow her down is the cold, or more specifically, it will slow her army of 8000 down.
I wrote more than i thought, but these are my thoughts on the last 2 (maybe 3) episodes of season 3, please respond to my statements and questions while staying within season 1-3 range.}


I am a little bit sad now that i am done, it was a very good way to procrastinate my mid term exams. I originally did not know that the show was still being made, i thought it stopped at season 5, im glad i was wrong. My biggest problem with season 5 was the complete unexplained absence of Brandon Stark and his companions, not to mention his little brother who has been missing a lot longer. It sucks that Jura got touched by grey scale, but he can only infect others if others touch his grey scale right? because he touched a lot of people after that. it was good to see Varys reunite with Tyrion. They left us hanging with Dany, Arya, and Sansa, but i suppose they couldn't close the season with everything answered. It really, really sucks what happened to Jon. I wanted Stannis dead since just after season 3, i am glad he died (presumably), especially after everything he did against people he knew long before the red woman put thoughts in his head. The red woman showing up at castle black, then Jon dies, i guess she (maybe) made the brother turn so she could get ""kings blood"". At least Sam got out. I think Cersei got what she deserved, with all of her scheming. I very much dislike Ellaria and her three stooges.

My new kill list is (in no order)- Cersei, Ellaria, High sparrow and his followers, Little Finger, All brothers who betrayed Jon, The Red Woman, Stannis (if alive), Ramsey, Roose, Ilyn, Walder Frey, The white walkers, The Stone Men, more im sure. Edit- Robin


A couple questions 
1. Has there been any word on why Bran was not in season 5
2. Why won't Dany release her dragons?
3. Was there only ever two penises shown in the series (Hodor and walk of atonement), neither were necessary, why?
4. The battle is now between Lion, Serpent, Dragon, and Torture X?
5. The Mountain is now a Frankenstein type guard?
6. Only one giant was shown after the wall battle, his he the only one?
7. I know i have to wait until April, are episodes bi weekly? because 10 episodes is pretty short, and in season 5 there were some ""previously on"" stuff.
8. I have seen some people talking about books, what are these books and do they expand past what we have seen?
I can not wait to partake in conversations and give my opinions on this Sub Reddit, thanks for reading,",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Hopefully her next husband is someone who's going to help her retake westeros. 
So who are some good westerosi bachlors suitable for marriage? 

Trystane Martells - Seem to be an obvious choice since Myrcella is dead and Martells were royal to the targ during the robert's rebellion. We know that Targs had no problem marrying Martells before, and Dorne's royalty will be strengthened with marriage

Loras Tyrell - Tyrell were royal to the targ during the rebellion, and the Tyrell beem to have a history of being married to the king. He's not a kingsguard in the show, and is a bachelor. He could end up replacing Margery as the royal consort. Sure, he's gay, but a political marriage has it's price, and gaining the support of the Reach is important. 

Jon Snow - Assuming he lives, and somehow is fine breaking the oath of the night's watch. he's still a bastard, so he'll need to be legitimized if he's going to wed the Queen. Dany will have to forgive the userper's dog or he's found out to be a targ. Overall, there's a lot of barriers to be met for this match to be even plausible. Depending on how the battle of winterfell goes, marrying the stark could mean gaining the support of the north. However I'm not sure how much help that'll be considering north is pretty decimated at this point and is not a powerful ally. 

Bran Stark - Maybe his tree power proved to be indispensable during the fight against the white walkers and somehow regains his rightful seat in winterfell. Dany will have to forgive the starks for ousting the targ, and he's got to be able to ""perform""....nah

Robin Arryn - He is the lord of the vale, single, easily manipulated, and have the access to the most untouched army in westeros....but this is creepy. I don't think Dany is into younger men. 

Petyr Bailish - This guy is still single. He's the lord paramount of the riverland, although in name only. He got Sansa to get hold of the north, and plays around in Vale in his little fingers. Marriage to Petyr could bring in the support of the North, riverland, and the Vale. The unspent military in the Vale could be valuable, and Petyr could give Dany some useful advise on ruling....if he doesn't stab her back first. His influence on these regions are also shaky and changeable. Imagine the look on Varys's face when Dany marries littlefinger! 

Jamie Lannister - It's unlikely that Dany will forgive Lannisters for what they did for her family, but she forgave Tyrion, and Jamie is a changed man. He still seem to be sexually royal to Cersei though. Marriage to Jamie would split up lannisters and gain the westerland militery, who are occupying the king's landing. 

Tyrion Lannister - It's unlikely that Dany need to marry a man who's already under her clutches, but if for some reason he ends up as the only lannister left after this mess, and gains the royalty of lannister bannerman.....somehow....

Jorah Mormont - It's unlikely that Dany will marry a man already under her clutches. Friendzoned

Random sexy knight - because she's a queen and she can do whatever she want. ",8,2,False,self,,,,,

My prediction operates under what I think is a fairly uncontroversial speculation about Jon Snow.  I think he will of course be brought back to life and/or saved from the brink of death.  I think Melisandra will most likely bring her back in the TV show, but think that warging will play a major role in his resurrection in the books--but it would awesome if the TV show had warging involved as well.

In the books I think it's quite clear that warging is a big part of the narrative, especially for the Stark family, and even more dramatically for Jon.  Arya can warg into cats to watch herself while she is blind, for instance.  Jon wargs with Ghost, and his last breath is to call out his wolf's name.  The prologue of ADWD is devoted entirely to a powerful warg who mentions a quasi-immortality via warging/shifting his soul/consciousness around after his body dies.  Perhaps Mel will get there and go through with the ritual of bringing Jon back, and while this is happening, Jon's soul/consciousness is in Ghost, which makes it possible for him to return to his body.  

Anyhow, yeah, Jon comes back.  When he comes back, my prediction is that he will *dissolve* the Night's Watch.  He will officially end the longstanding brotherhood/tradition/power structure, which has supposedly existed for 8,000 years according to legend.  That's right: no more Crows, no more taking the black--or at least it will changed to the point of barely resembling the old military order.  The Night's Watch are in tatters anyhow, their numbers low, not to mention that of the Crows that remain, several if not many are traitors.  Some directly played a part in Jon's assassination, others played a blind eye, and others still failed to punish the traitors who murdered their commander.

Jon will slaughter the traitors and fence-sitting Crows, and begin a new era at and around The Wall.  Wildlings will take over the wall and rebuild and occupy all of the abandoned forts at the wall, with the Crows that were loyal to Jon.  Not sure what it will be called or Jon will be a Lord or perhaps even King of this new force.  Perhaps he will declare himself King of the North after coming back, and then have his new loyal Crow/Wildling army be included in and join forces with the remainder of the houses/armies loyal to the Starks.  Then there is also the remains of Stannis's army (if any), assuming he was killed (I don't think he was killed, but will no longer have any power as a failed Azor Ahai, and Jon will be recognized as the real Azor Ahai).  It will then only be a matter of time before Jon and this new force crushes house Bolton and reclaims Winterfell, which is alluded to in the [Stark teaser trailer](https://youtu.be/CkuSem8KJP4).

This ending of the Night's Watch also has further significance to the overall narrative, in that this military order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the Seven Kingdoms from the far North.  I agree with the theories of Alt Shift X and others that subscribe to the idea that The Others/White Walkers are simply misunderstood, and it was more likely that they built/created [The Wall (it is ice, after all)](https://youtu.be/Ih_ZAGCfMY0?t=13m30s) rather than the mythological story of the first men building such a massive structure.

So in having the full force of the wall restored and the small and rag-tag band of Crows that is wrought with traitors officially disbanded, Jon and his new army will in the process learn a whole lot more about the wall and its forts/ruins.  I bet some new and very important information will be gained in this shift of power and re-establishment of the wall, which will then give Jon a more nuanced understanding of the White Walkers.  Maybe a glass candle will be found in one of the ruins, most likely the Nightfort?  

Perhaps Jon will ask himself if the wall was made to keep the White Walkers out, or to keep the Seven Kingdoms out of the North.  From there maybe he will make some kind of a sacrifice for the Seven Kingdoms to restore order to the world and convince the White Walkers that they can have the far North and all the Wildlings will either have moved south of the wall or been turned into a wight.  I think that this might mean killing and/or fighting with Dany and her dragons as well, which of course pose a threat to the Others, as they embody fire and produced the magic metal (Valyrian steel) capable of killing them.  If anyone is/was the biggest threat to the Others, it's House Targaryen.

Jon could also take sides with Dany and the dragons, however, and choose to just completely eradicate the Others altogether in a massive war and subsequent genocide of all White Walkers and their culture.  But that seems too ""easy"" or simplistic for a Game of Thrones major (perhaps the most important) plot line, if you ask me.  To me it seems more likely, and a big twist, that Jon is forced to go to war with Dany, and in the end either Jon winning and placating the White Walkers, or Dany winning and having to then face the White Walkers.  I don't think Dany will be able to take on the White Walkers with whatever forces she can muster plus the dragons, and she will also have had her forces weakened in taking over Westeros and/or Jon's forces.  In this case, I think the White Walkers will simply fight her, win, and take over all of Westeros.  Humanity will then have to abandon the continent and stay in Essos.  The anti-climax, doom and gloom, Kafkaesque ending.

Though what if the White Walkers start attacking Essos in the far East in Asshai, which apparently may have happened before, long ago in the ASOIAF narrative?  Not sure.  Also not sure what the rest of the Starks (remember that Arya, Rickon, Bran, and Sansa are still alive, and would likely side with Jon) will play in all this.  But that I think is possible if not probable is that the Night's Watch will be no more after Jon comes back, and some kind of new power structure is established by Jon to deal with everything that is to come.  All this may be beyond the scope of season 6, as from what I gather at least 8 seasons will be made.  But at the very least a framework for all this conflict, whether or not my predictions are accurate or not, will have to be laid out in season 6.  Very excited for April!

EDIT: Forgot to mention!  I also think that Jon will take a new name after he is ""reborn"" as part of his transformation into Azor Ahai.  So while I call him ""Jon"" in this post, it is for lack of a guess of what his new name will be.  Seems kinda boring to just call him ""Azor Ahai.""  So I have no idea.  But I don't think he will be called ""Jon Snow"" anymore, but will either give himself or be given a new name as part of his return/transformation.",6,8,False,self,,,,,

The Hound, I think is Lawful Neutral; he follows orders, he follows his code to stay alive, he says a lot of evil sounding things, but the way he spares lives after some convincing from Arya (and the way he saved Sansa) shows that he isn't completely heartless, and not evil.

Arya herself is True Neutral; she follows a path of death, not out of good or evil, but out of balance.

Jon Snow is the definition of Chaotic Good: a foolhearty warrior who puts himself (and others) at risk in order to do the right thing, every time, all the time. The way he ignores his vows when he sleeps with Ygritte shows that he follows his own drum beat, and truly isn't lawful.

A lot of people think that Ser Davos is Lawful Neutral, but given how many times he's disobeyed his King (striking the Red Witch, releasing the Boratheon Bastard), I'd say he's more Neutral Good.

Anyone disagree with any of these?

**WHEN:** April 22 - 24, 2016

**WHERE:** [Mountain Lake Lodge](http://www.mtnlakelodge.com/) in Pembroke, Virginia

**WHAT:** The Convention of Ice &amp; Fire, a convention themed around George R. R. Martins *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, is the only convention of its sort in America.

**WHO:** Some of the coolest people you'll ever meet, including me.

**WHY:** Because who doesn't want to party with nerds for a weekend?

In all seriousness, I took a leap of faith in 2013 and came to this convention stag (nyuk nyuk).  I had never been to a con before and everyone was lovely and welcoming, and I have since made some amazing friends from all over the continent.

It is a *tiny* con (although with a new location we are going to expand this year!) but there's something for everyone.  Panels, feasts, cosplay, gaming tournaments, a mock tourney/archery competition, a dance, and lots more.  

There are many attendees who have not read some or all of the published material, but please be aware this is a ""spoilers all"" environment (with the show now caught up to the books, this shouldn't be too big of a problem--plus, I can't imagine anyone would not respect your wishes to remain Unsullied. You just have to ask~)

We have representatives from Tower of the Hand and the Podcast of Ice and Fire attend every year.  So far, no celebrity appearances (which keeps costs down)--but they are a possibility in the future!

If it's at all your sort of thing, I recommend joining the facebook group, where you can see our antics in person.  

I am a volunteer for this con and am happy to answer any questions you may have!

[Here is the album I posted here after 2015's con](http://imgur.com/a/4LXmN) (don't worry though--*plenty* of attendees don't cosplay)

She was married to Renly, who, by all right, was the lord of the Stormland. Even is the castle is not in the hand of the crown per see, they must have the idea of who it rightly belongs to. It's highly unlikely that they'll give it to Stannis, being the traitor and all. 

When Robb Stark rebelled against the Crown, he still retained the title as the Lord of Winterfell and the North, even after his defeat at the Red Wedding. We can see this because Sansa is still regarded as the Heiress of Winterfell. Which is...really weird. 

So does the same apply for Renly? Is he still Lord of Storm's End and Stormland in the view of the crown even after the rebellion? Because Margery was married to Renly, which makes her the Lady of Storm's End and Stormland. Even after her husband's death, that title should still be there unless the crown revoked it. And why would the crown revoke it? Tyrells are allies. 

And it's not like having the higher title means that they don't hold onto the lower titles. Cersei is the Queen Dowager, which is a higher station than the Lady of Casterly Rock and Westerland, but Cersei is still the Lady of Casterly Rock.

Just flipping through, it really dawned on me how dedicated and how much effort and though goes into constructing this show. 

A particular passage that really spoke out to me was a chapter on the Red Wedding, where there was an interview with Richard Madden (Robb) about his thought process on how to act during his death scene, and how originally going into filming it, he was going to play Robb as defiant to the end,trying to go out fighting, but as the scene evolved around him, he realized it made so much more sense to play Robb as resigned to his fate at the very end, that the character had given up, and realized it was all over. That kind of character motivation and detail just leapt out at me.

Just that little detail made me realize that the actors and crew on this show aren't just making a show, they're constructing an entire WORLD. A living, breathing intensely complex world, that continues to impress every season. As much as Season 5 had it's ups and down, these people are taking 10+ months every year to construct an entire world for us. That's why I think Game of Thrones is one of the, if not the most impressive television shows ever, because the crew put in such a level of dedication and thought. ",6,26,False,self,,,,,

The only time she seem to be really angry at Tyrion was when he sent Myrcella to Dorne, which is understandable since Cersei cares a lot about her children, and obviously when Cersei think Tyrion murdered Joffrey. 

Show Cersei says that Tyrion murdered her mother when he was born, but that seems to be it when it comes to the reason why Cersei hates Tyrion. That and the fact that Tyrion is an ugly dwarf that she considers is a disgrace. That's not the same level of hate as....believing that he's out there to kill her one day. Is that why show Cersei seems kinder? 

The Show doesn't mention anything about the 'younger and more beautiful queen' and in the show, Cersei shows a lot of kindness to Sansa (given the circumstances) and protects her in a lot of ways and gives pessimistic advice, like how she should only love her children, and calling her a little dove. The show Cersei is still very antagonistic toward Margery, but is this nothing more than jealous mother's reaction to her daughter-in-law who's ""snatching away her little boy"" (which is a popular emotional response from a doting mother to the newly married son). But locking Margery away by the Faith Militant seems to be too over the top if we consider this to be the action of a jealous mother-in-law. 

What do you think? Is the Show Cersei completely free from the notion of ""Tyrion will kill me"" and ""the younger and more beautiful queen will cast me down""? 
Is the show Cersei just a brother-loving, children-obsessed woman with a case of dwarf racism? ",12,7,False,self,,,,,

I have seen every episode of GOT and just recently I just needed something to fill in the time while I waited for S6 so I picked up the first book and it is way better than I thought it would be. I assumed since it was such a large volume book that it would be dragged out it some parts and get boring but so far (only 1/3 maybe a little under) the book has been easy to read, fun to read, and captivating!

1497,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-1-29,2016,1,29,21,438j1u,self.gameofthrones,[S5/ADWD] Theory about Valyrian Steel and Dragon Glass,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/438j1u/s5adwd_theory_about_valyrian_steel_and_dragon/,---__-_--__----_-_--,1454069188,"Get your Valyrian foil hats on guys, 'cause this is pure speculation. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I was thinking about how a lot of people in the ASoIAF/GoT universe, when talking about Valyrian steel, mention that no one can create a new sword or item out of it, only reforge it. Before I get into the meat of my theory though, I'd like to lay down some facts about the two materials. 

&amp;nbsp;

[**Valyrian**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_steel) [**Steel**](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel)

* It can kill white walkers
* It's sharp as hell
* It's lighter and stronger than regular steel
* It doesn't require sharpening
* ""Valyrian steel is a fantasy metal. Which means it has magical characteristics, and magic plays a role in its forging."" - GRRM

&amp;nbsp;

[**Dragon Glass**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass)

* It can kill white walkers
* It's a volcanic glass
* Tons of it is at Dragonstone, where some dragons used to hang out
* It's dark
* It's sharper than steel, although more brittle
* Called ""frozen fire"" by the Valyrians
* Glass candles are made of it (it's magic)

&amp;nbsp;

Here's my theory: 

Could Valyrian Steel be a steel and Dragon Glass alloy? 

* They both kill white walkers
* Dragon Glass is sharp but brittle. Steel is less sharp, but it's far stronger. Could a combination of the two be both sharp as hell and durable?
* They're both magic
* Valyrian steel has ripples throughout the steel. With a normal sword with ripples, it's essentially carbon that has been beaten into the steel while folding it. With Valyrian Steel, it could be the dark molten Dragon Glass that's been mixed into it as well as the carbon from folding. More on this below

&amp;nbsp;

So how could such a thing be forged? I don't think it requires blood magic or anything like that. Just dragons. [Dragon's fire gets hotter the older it gets](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragon) (*... like Balerion and Vhagar in the fullness of their power, could (and did) melt steel and stone.*), so an older one could liquify both steel and the kind of rock or sand necessary to form Dragon Glass (like at Dragonstone), meaning that the blacksmith could just mix the the two molten materials together and make sure they cool properly to form Valyrian steel, forming the ripples you see. 

&amp;nbsp;

I had a quick look around for real life glass/metal alloys, [this is all I found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal). I wonder... Could it be possible to mix liquid metal and glass together, then quickly cool them so they have the same structure?

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway that's all I can think of at this hour. Sorry if this has been posted a billion times, I don't frequent these kinds of places, so I wouldn't know. Thoughts?",28,18,False,self,,,,,

Here we come to Ramsay Snow. While his father was fighting in the War of the Five Kings and presiding over Harrenhal, Ramsay was toying with Theon and eventually turned him into Reek. Eventually Ramsay earned the favor of his father and earned the name Bolton. 

What I find interesting is the contrast between the two men. We have Theon, the rightful heir to the Iron Islands and throughout his interactions with Ramsay he becomes completely disowned by his father (some would say he already was but I think at this point there is no going back as the only one in his family that cares for him is Yara) while Ramsay finally becomes appreciated by Lord Bolton. 

It just seems funny that they travel down the same path (trying to make their father proud). One succeeds and another fails. I'm not sure if that was on purpose or not but I've watched the whole series multiple times and finally noticed. 

On that note. Are there any other comparisons or contrasts between two characters that you might have noticed? ",87,515,False,self,,,,,

They all have been prisoners (hostages, playthings) of some kind for the majority of their respective storylines and they all have pov narratives.
It's also a way the author can skirt abandoned ideas that led to nothing that actually mattered the series.

Who is next?
See list at the bottom.

Obviously, there are several patterns in the GoT, perhaps the greatest of which is that if you are a King or prominent Lord, you die. In order to keep this well established pattern more characters must die, and there are at this time a limited selection of available characters (see list at end). So far those who have paid the price:

- Aerys II Targaryen (7 Kingdoms)

- Jon Arryn

- King Robert Baratheon (7 Kingdoms)

- Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark (Winterfell, the North)

- King Robb Stark (Winterfell, the North)

- Renley Baratheon (self proclaimed Kind of the 7 Kingdoms)

- Viserys Targaryen

- Khal Drogo

- Kraznys mo Nakloz

- Joffrey Baratheon (7 Kingdoms)

- Tywin Lannister (Lord of Casterly Rock)

- Hizdahr zo Loraq

- Pyat Pree

- Spice King

- Xaro Xhoan Daxos

- Rickard Karstark

- Jeor Mormont (Lord Commander at Castle Black)

- Styr the Thenn

- Lysa Arryn (the Vail)

- Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg (Mag the Mighty)

- Mance Rayder (Kind Beyond the Wall)

- Jon Snow (Commander of the Night's Watch)

- Stannis Barathian (in the show but not in the book)

- Tywin Lannister (Lord of Casterly Rock)

- Balon Greyjoy (not in the show yet but in the book it is known)

- Craster (effectively a Lord)

- Karsi

- Lord of Bones/Rattleshirt
.


So, who is next?

- *Lord Petyr Baelish (Lord of Harranhall and the Vail)

- *Tommen Baratheon (7 Kingdoms)

- Euron Greyjoy (eventually)

- A Tyrell (**Mace or *Olenna)

- Daenerys Targaryen

- A Bolton (perhaps *Roose at the hand of Ramsay)

- *Ramsay Bolton

- **Wader Frey, Lothar Frey, Black Walder Rivers (perhaps all at the same time)

- Tycho Nestoris (the Banker)

- Kevan Lannister

- Doran Martell

- *Robin Arryn

- **Alliser Thorne (Castle Black new Commander?)

- Tormund Giantsbane

- Bran Stark (currently the heir to the Stark holdings)

- Jon Targaryan (Jon Snow, NOT JON STARK)

It was beautiful, Lysa's death. Forget Joffrey's (although I'm glad the little brat is dead), her death was so satisfying! When she was holding Sansa near the 'moon door' and yelling at her, I was scared she would take Petyr's command of ""let her go"" to mean let Sansa go into the void, but thankfully that didn't happen.


It was so perfect, though, the way he killed her: ""I've only ever loved one person my entire life..."" I was really hoping he was going to say Catelyn and then push her... and then,


""Your sister."" *push*


It was beautiful. I think I might have started laughing, I was definitely smiling. There definitely worse characters on the show (that damned Mr. Sadistic Smile, Ramsay--god he needs to die ASAP) but she was just so crazy and horrible that I'm glad she's gone.

Below are summaries and links to all the theories in in this theory series which has now ended and is no longer being updated. It's an encyclopaedia of theories. I had lots of fun writing them, and hope you enjoy reading them too.

Major theories warning. Don't read on if you don't want to read theories.

1\. **[The IceBrandon: ""Winter Is Flying""](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/20/icebrandon/)** 

-	""Winter is coming"" means the ice dragon named Winter is coming.

-	Bloodraven via Bran wakes the icedragon named Winter in the black pool of Winterfell.

-	Bran has already flown as the ice dragon in his dream where he gave his (corn) seed and his soul to the crow, Bloodraven.
-	Bran died and was reborn with the magic of the ground and weirwood roots just as Dany died and was reborn by fire.
-	This entire story is set in play by the conflict between Bran and Jaime when Jaime threw Bran from the tower.
-	Their conflict begins the saga and it will frame its conclusion. The conflict came into motion 


2\. **[Azor Ahannister &amp; The Others That Were Promised](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/20/azor-ahannister-dragonsteel-the-lighthouse/)** 

-	Golden hand means Lord of Light in Valyrian.

-	Jamie will forge the blue-white flamed Lightbringer through (Brienne) killing Lady Stoneheart, then fulfilling both the valonqar and Azor Ahai prophesies in killing Cersei and lasty through killing his love Brienne.

-	The Others That Were Promised: there are maybe over a dozen or more heroes prophesied.

-	There may be three or more Azor Ahai's: Sam, Jamie and Dany (who is a Nissa Nissa figure).

-	Dragonsteel may be forged with ironwood charcoal. The fire of the dragon not the fire from the dragon is needed to forge it, namely the life soulfire of the dragon.


3\. **[Brienne The ""More Beautiful""](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/20/brienne-the-beauty-and-the-lightbringer-and-valunquar-prophesies/)**

-	Why Brienne is Jamies Nissa Nissa.

4\. **[The Stone Dragon is Made of Ice]( http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/30/the-stone-dragon-is-made-of-ice/?preview_id=174)** 

-	The stone dragon Melissandre wants to wake is Winter the ice dragon.

5\. **[The Ice Dragon Must Have Three Heads](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/06/07/the-ice-dragon-must-have-three-heads/)** 

-	Aside from Winter the enormous ice dragon, there may be two more ice dragons in the cave with Bloodraven.

6\. **[Lightsounder: The Hammerhorn of the Waters](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/06/06/the-cause-of-the-long-night-the-hammerhorn-of-the-waters/)** 

-	The Hammer of the Waters may be a horn; Euron's horn. The Hammerhorn of the Waters may be sounded by Daenerys the Unburnt, who is the only one who wouldnt burn from the inside after sounding it three times to bring a Ragnarokgeddon apocalypse.

-	Dany summons the red comet to strike the moon which brings the Long Night. Chunks of moon falls to Earthos bringing plumes of smoke to block out the sun and bring darkness. Simultaneously the moons gravity brings flooding and cold. Azor Ahais sword may also be a horn.

-	The Hammerhorn may be one of three Lightbringers, Lightsounder. Thus Dany is a Nissa Nissa of sorts to the very surprising dead man on the prow of a ship who makes her sound the Hammerhorn is a third Azor Ahai.

7\. **[The Hooded Man of Winterfell Revealed](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/20/urrathon-night-walker-euron-greyjoy/)**

-	This provides the basis for For The Night, Theon is the sleepwalking killer of Yellow Dick by being a nightwalkee to the nightwalker Euron, the hooded man of Winterfell.

-	Euron controlled Theon's movements via a glass candle.

8\. **[""For The Night""](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/06/10/a-shocking-new-theory-for-the-night/)** 

-	Jons death was not a murder. It was a blood sacrifice to wake the stone dragon... that is made of ice.

-	Euron is the nighwalker that used a glass candle to control the movments and conscious actions of Theon the nightwalkee.

-	The body language of Jons killers tells the truth but words lie.

9\. **[Winter Fell: Death of Azor Ahai &amp; The IceBrandon](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/31/the-death-of-the-icebrandon/)** 

-	Jamie is one of the reborn manifestations of Azor Ahai.

-	Jamie will thrust a flaming Lightbringer sword into Winter the IceBrandon melting the ice dragon and extinguishing Lightbringer.

-	When Lightbringers fire goes out, so does Jamie. Both die in the process.

10\. **[Flight of The IceBrandon: Chapter Review](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/05/24/46/)** 

-	A line by line chapter review of Brans flight as the ice dragon.

11\. **[The Dance of The Dragons is Plural](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/06/07/the-dance-of-the-dragons-is-plural/)**
  
-	Show evidence that Winter, the ice dragon made of stone, is coming.

12\. **[Possible Ice Dragon sighting in Hardhome episode](http://endgameofthrones.com/2015/06/02/possible-ice-dragon-sighting-in-hardhome-episode/)** 

-	CGI is not cheap. Showrunners subtly put in a a CGI ice dragon into the show. Winter is flying.

S6 will start with Jon lying in the snow, in the next scene Bran will awaken from his dream and Jon still alive at the wall. Bran will try to safe Jons life, but he must decide between the rescue of Westeros and Jon. So Jon will die, like Bran was foreshadowing, maybe not like in season 5, but he will die.

I think he is gonna have to grow larger, have tougher scales and keep to flying for the time being (The thing that makes Dragons dangerous is not their fire breathing, it's their fire breathing while flying and never landing that makes them dangerous because you can rarely hit them). The thing is, there have always been a time skip in Dany's story between the seasons so far which has justified the dragon growing, but this time we will probably pick up immediately where season 5 ended, they are gonna have to make a big time skip mid season if the dragons are gonna grow more.
