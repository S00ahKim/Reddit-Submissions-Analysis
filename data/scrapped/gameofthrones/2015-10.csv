My theory stems from the show and everything I have read on this page and on the internet (cool right?). Also, I have looked and haven't seen this around anywhere else, but I apologize if this turns out to be another ""HEY JON SNOW TECHNICALLY DIED SO HE IS RELEASED FROM HIS NIGHT'S WATCH VOWS"" theories.
But even so, Ill start my theory with saying Jon Snow has to be resurrected, and will eventually become Azor Ahai.
 
Reading a few other theories posted in this sub, he already would meet a few requirements to fulfill what he needs to do in order to become the new Azor Ahai. So I wont get into those details, I'm sure you could find them if you looked around.

I dont think he will become Azor Ahai when he is initially resurrected, but that he will be reborn into Azor Ahai sometime around the ""rumored"" battle that has been spotted for the north. For this to happen, he will probably be reunited with Sansa during, or after the battle.

Being GoT, I assume that Sansa will have been injured when she jumped from the castle walls with Theon. I figure they will not be able to travel very far from Winterfell, and will still be in the area when the battle occurs (assuming this is near where the battle occurs). 

If Sansa was hurt during the fall, I think she will be in very, very bad shape and nearly dead (due to infection or something) when the battle occurs.  If Sansa is still in ""reasonable"" shape during the battle I think she will be gravely injured during the fighting.

Jon Snow will find her after the battle, or someone will bring her to him, and he will see the bad shape she is in. Knowing that she will likely not survive, he will be forced to make the difficult decision to end her misery by killing one of the last Starks. And of course this would be done with Longclaw (already proven to be deadly against White Walkers).

This would be a HUGE sacrifice that Jon would have to make, and through this sacrifice I think he will be reborn again again and his sword will become Lightbringer. 

Thoughts?


EDIT: This theory is not about if we need Lightbringer, but only a potential way it could come to be in the show.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

It's common for certain types of birds; crows and ravens to call predators toward prey, but the symbiotic relationship between wolves and ravens actually goes a step further. The link will take you to the best write-up I've found on the topic.

All that to say, it's just an interesting perspective in the world of Westeros, dire wolves, three-eyed ravens, Bran, wargs, and so on.

I thought it was an interesting connection between real life and maybe some George has had in mind. What do you think?

I could handle watching Ned get decapitated, Robb and Catelyn betrayed by their own banner men, and Oberyn getting his skull crushed in (even though my heart still races during that scene) without a problem. Yet I just can't bring myself to watch episode 9. I think the wound is still too new and hasn't healed yet. So last time I watched this full episode was about a week after it aired. I really like the last 20 minutes a lot, but the scene before Daznak's pit was incredibly hard to watch. Even though Shireen was off screen just the sounds and screams were far more than enough to make me almost have a panic attack my heart was racing so fast.



I think it's because for Ned, Robb and Cateyln their deaths were more of a shock factor, but it didn't leave you haunted with them screaming in pain and agony. It was more of the shock of betrayal at a wedding that caused for Robb and Catelyns deaths to be so sad. Ned was the main character who's death is also a bit more of shock factor. He was told he'd get mercy, but instead he gets his head cut off. Which is a pretty quick death. Oberyn was bad just because of the manner he was killed. He was a talented warrior, witty, smart and he appeared to have killed the Mountain. Sadly we were all so foolish as Oberyn. He got cocky with trying to get the confession, thinking he had the Mountain wounded enough that he was unable to fight. The shining glimmer of hope that victory is assured and Tyrion is free...is quickly shattered with the most violent death seen on the show. The sound of Oberyn's cries and screams of agony as the Mountain manages to still knock his teeth out in a single punch before he gouges his eyes out. All the while crushing his skull. It's a brutal death that leaves your heart racing and a mental image you wished you hadn't seen. 



Shireen to me is fairly similar to how Oberyns death was. We were told and reminded all season of how much Stannis loved his daughter, the death was not fast, and so the cries and screams of agony were not only cries of being burned, but of betrayal like Catelyn in a way. She trusted her father as Catelyn trusted Walder Frey. They both begged their murderers to help them. Unlike Ned, Robb and Catelyn who didn't have agonizing cries of pain and suffering (Catelyn cried out because of psychological pain, and not from the pain of being killed in a brutal way) Shireen did. After rewatching season 4 with 3 of my friends at different times. Oberyn's death doesn't have as bad as an effect on me as it use to. Yet only watching S5E9 once I don't know if I'm ready for her burning. Luckily we don't see the burning itself, but those screams are terrifying.



 I think after writing all this up I'm gonna do it. I'm going to watch episode 9 all the way from the beginning. At least the episode ends with Drogon (who is huge, but has more growing to do) reeking havoc on the Harpies. Watching dragons destroy shit is something we've all had been waiting for. Probably gonna get some alcohol though for the burning scene. Just gotta have something to make that scene go by easier. ",25,23,False,self,,,,,

I'm curious because it feels like every day I'm hearing about some new event or festival he'll be attending. I'm exaggerating, of course, but first it was SDCC (of course) then it was FACTS in Belgium then Russia Comic Con then some film festival in Savannah, GA and today another Comic Con in Argentia. It just seems like a lot and in very different locations. I'm not too familiar with these sorts of things, but I'm assuming he gets paid. Basically what I'm asking a) is Alfie attending a strange amount of conventions b) could he be doing so because he recently found out he's out of his steady job c) aka Theon dies this season?

Who knows. Maybe Alfie just really loves traveling and meeting fans. He seems like a cool guy. Although he did make a comment at SDCC about needing to ""pay his mortgage"" when asked if Theon died from the fall.

Very interested in any other theories about how Jon might end up being more/greater post- resurrection, rather than being diminished. Here's mine:  

Jon dies, Wargs into Ghost. His body is resurrected by the Walkers. He then wargs back into his wight/Walker body. He is fully aware of who he is. Think Coldhands II. In the process he has acquired some of the powers of the Others. Immortality perhaps? The ability to resurrect the dead? Who knows. But resurrecting the dead could prove to be a very handy skill in the days of war that lie ahead.

But he also finds a broken, old horn with all the dragonglass. At the time, he doesn't think too much of it; he's curious, but doesn't really think about it. 

We know that dragonglass is one of the few things that can kill White Walkers, and that with the looming threat of them, the supplies that Jon found will be crucial. We know that whoever left those there knew this too; why else would they have wrapped it in their cloak? 

So why is the horn there? All this incredibly valuable weaponry and a broken old horn; it doesn't exactly fit. Jon thinks nothing of the horn, and gives it to Sam, telling him to use it as an ale horn. 

Not much later, Qhorin Halfhand tells Jeor Mormont that he believes Mance Rayder is going to attempt to break the wall, and that the reason he has his host at the Frost Fangs is to gather whatever magical power is necessary for this, not explicitly stated. 

Legend says that the Horn of Winter can bring down the wall with just its blast. It's heavily implied by Halfhand that this is what Mance Rayder is looking for. Is it possible that a brother of the Nights Watch (Benjen?) found it, and his it there for the other brothers to find?

If Jon Snow has the horn of winter, that could be foreshadowing that he becomes a white Walker. We know already of his fighting abilities; he has the motive; the precedent is there, with the nights king being a stark. And if a white Walker had the horn of winter, well, that would be a devastating blow to the Nights Watch, and the rest of Westeros. ",9,4,False,self,,,,,

Will tomm send lanisters there to occupy it?

With the fall of stannis and his line, there is a lot of open ended things that could happen. To me Stannis was my favorite, even at the very end. I know the writers say hes toast, but I hope with GRRM releasing that in the books ""without a doubt"" of his surviving the battle, they change their mind.

Do you think White Walkers can also be resurrected or is it another one? The face looks really similar and the weapon he carried was the same, maybe they all carry the same weapon idk.

b. Do you think the Night's King got interested in Jon Snow after seeing him killing the White Walker? He seemed cold as always (eh, sry) but a bit surprised when the camera showed him.

c. Who is the Night's King in your opinion? The 13th? Lord Commander? In the Game of Thrones wiki, the Night's King is said to be him. Is it certain?

d. Do you think we will see a female White Walker?

e. In [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3lc0d3/spoilers_all_everything_we_can_possibly_know/) its said that  ""there will be a White Walker scene that will make Hardhome look like child's play."" , If it comes true what do you think will happen? Ice Dragon? Horn ? Spiders?

But a more serious take would be maybe introducing a Samurai character. A character who is inspired by the way of Samurai, and stands by a similar code. I would like to think he or she was part a Japanese inspired culture that maybe the Yi Ti destroyed some years ago. I know this is probably impossible to introduce a character like this before the show ends.

Snow (not as much of a divergence as those below) is:
1) Physiologically hanging on and maester corrects the hypervolemia whilst repairing the extensive damage to his abdomen and mediastinum.
2) Dead but raised by a Melisandre somehow, Melisandre who did not seem capable of resurrection judging by her reaction to Beric Dondarrion.
3) Wargs in and out. Magic.
4) now a Walker. Eh, might as well list it. 
5) WTF

So Selmy is dead in the show but leading the defence of Meereen in the books.
The possibilities (not in great detail) for the show in season 6:
1) Mormont is an amalgamated character, loses the romance and gains the Selmy role
2) Tyrion (and Varys) take control where Selmy does in the books. (Seeming more likely given Mormont goes walkabout with Daario)
3) Selmy comes back alive (bullshit but seems like a possibility that always comes up with ASOIAF fans)
4) Some weird rethreading of the Griffin storyline with blackfyre/aegon IV

So Stannis is defeated (if not dead as well) in the show but not too far from it in the books with an unknown future:
1) Stannis survives and Brienne is stopped or changes her mind (swings at the tree instead of the neck of Stannis)
2) Someone picks up the Stannis pieces, either Seaworth or Snow or etc. (hard to justify new armies going where the Baratheon remnants were slaughtered even if they come better prepared and are Northerners)
3) Some convoluted use of the freefolk and the nights watch with Snow
4) or?

Greyjoys - I must admit I hate this house and get bored at every scene and reading the chapters involving them:
1) as in the book because they have not diverged in the show in such a way that prevents using the book material scene for scene
2) some piecemeal adoption of book scenes ",7,3,False,self,,,,,

My theory is that during or after the invasion of the First Men a group of Children traveled North, and either found a source of their powerful ice magic or developed it themselves to survive. I'm guessing they hated the First Men and possibly the Children who stayed behind and made peace, and/or began hating all living things after they changed, and they invade the lands of the living to get revenge.

I like the theory in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih_ZAGCfMY0) that the end of the war in the Long Night was due to a peace negotiated with the WW instead of some kind of great victory, and that they're invading now because people have done something to violate the agreement. If that's true it's possible that the Long Night was caused by WW magic, and they're the ones behind the winter starting now.

Points I've found that support this:

- The WW don't seem to have been a problem before the FM got to Westeros

- The Children had powerful magic, they shattered the arm of 
Dorne and flooded the Neck

- The Children used this magic to help repel the first WW invasion, so they had to at least have an idea how their magic worked

- The video I linked to argues that The Wall could have actually been built by the WW, and the lore states that the Children helped build it, but maybe it was the Children using WW magic that they had taken because they were so familiar with it

- They show humans being turned into WW, but that could be because there aren't that many Children left around, or because it just doesn't matter. Either way it appears that the WW might have all used to be living people

- I was just watching the episode where Sam kills a WW for the rewatch thread, and I noticed they zoom in on the face of the weirwood tree near the hut where they stay. Were they saying that the WW could see through the weirwood faces like the Children can? If so this would support the idea that their magic is similar.

What do you guys think?

##3.07 - ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair""

* Directed By: Michelle MacLaren
* Written By: George R. R. Martin
* Originally Aired: May 12, 2013

In the North, Jojen tells Bran they must go beyond the Wall to find the three-eyed raven, to Osha's horror. Jon and Ygritte's relationship deepens, much to Orell's displeasure. Theon is emasculated by his torturer. Talisa reveals to Robb that she is pregnant. Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, only to be captured by the Hound. Melisandre reveals to Gendry that his father was Robert Baratheon. Margaery comforts Sansa about her upcoming marriage, while Tyrion and Bronn discuss the match. Later, Shae tells Tyrion that she will not continue their relationship once he marries Sansa. Tywin counsels Joffrey and discusses Daenerys, with Tywin dismissing the danger she might pose. Daenerys reaches the city of Yunkai and receives an emissary. Roose Bolton departs Harrenhall for the Twins, a heavily fortified pair of castles that serve as the seat of House Frey, while Jaime says farewell to Brienne and departs for King's Landing. On the road, Qyburn reveals why he lost his Maester's chain and informs Jaime that Locke refused Brienne's father's ransom. Jaime returns to Harrenhall to find Brienne in a pit fighting a bear. He leaps in and saves Brienne and departs once more, this time with her.

---

##3.08 - ""Second Sons""

* Directed By: Michelle MacLaren
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: May 19, 2013

King's Landing hosts Tyrion and Sansa's wedding. Cersei intimidates Margaery in the Sept of Baelor, and Joffrey walks the bride down the aisle. At the wedding feast Tyrion gets drunk and causes a scene. In their bedroom, Tyrion tells Sansa they will not consummate their marriage until she wants to. The Hound reveals to Arya that they are heading for the Twins to ransom her to her brother. Stannis releases Davos. Melisandre and Gendry arrive at Dragonstone, where she seduces him and extracts blood from him with three leeches. In a magical ritual, Stannis casts them into the fire naming three usurpers: Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy and Joffrey Baratheon. Daenerys finds out Yunkai has employed a mercenary company called the ""Second Sons"". One of the lieutenants, Daario Naharis, kills the other leaders and pledges his and the company's loyalty to Daenerys. Sam and Gilly are attacked by a White Walker, whom Sam unexpectedly destroys with the help of the dragonglass dagger.

It seems to me like it could be much worse.  They've lost Ned, Caitlyn, Robb and Winterfell but they still have Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rikkon, Jon Snow and Theon (who will come back over).  All they really have to do is pull it all together and they could do some serious shit.  Arya isn't going to stay with the Faceless Men so she'll be back. Jon Snow is going to be King in the North and the people will rally around him after being under the Boltons for so long.  If you get any of these two together the whole game changes.  Theon and Sansa are already together.

I would say the Lannisters have it worse.  They have lost Tywin and thrown away the smartest one of them in Tyrion.  Joffrey is gone, their incest is about to be exposed so they're going to lose the throne and you can start writing Tomnin's obit as we speak.  Given the choice of Jon Snow or a Lannister, the people of KL are pretty much NOT going to choose a Lannister at this point and once they're removed, they're going to be finished everywhere.

So my money is on the Starkes.

If the R+L=J theory ends up being true, would Jon Snows body burn in the fire? Remember that Daenerys did not burn when she came out of the fire in Season 1. If Jon Snow is half Targaryen, what would happen if his body was to be burned? I remember he burned his hand early on in the show, but I still feelthe burning of his body will generate something different than any other body being burnt. Also the Azor Ahai theory points out ""born amongst salt &amp; smoke"". I feel Jon Snow could be somewhat ""reborn"" in this process and that would tie to the salt and smoke part of the theory. I just feel that everyones go-to theory is that Melisandre will resurrect Jon Snow, and I'm not discrediting that she may very well play a role in that, but I just dont think it will be the Beric Dondarrion route where prayers by Thoros brought him back to life.

Season 1 - Three rangers from Nights Watch are beyond The Wall to the north, tracking wildlings, and one of them comes across wildling remains, and the three of them end up being attacked by White Walkers. The lone survivor deserts the Watch, ends up being beheaded at Winterfell later in episode.

Season 2 - Joffreys nameday, and Tyrions arrival to Kings Landing, and the first appearance of what becomes Joffreys new fool. 

Season 3 - Sam is attacked by White Walkers and saved by the Nights Watch

Season 4 - Tywin Lannister has Ned Starks Valyrian steel sword, ""Ice"", melted down and forged into two new Valyrian steel swords, one of which goes to Joffrey, and one which goes to Jaime, which ends up going to Brienne and being named Oathkeeper

Season 5 - Cersei flashback (and first Game of Thrones flashback) to her as a child, in the woods outside Casterly Rock, with one of her friends. She is searching for and finds Maggi's hut. The witch Maggi ends up taking a sample of Cerseis blood and predicting her future, about her marrying the king, not the prince, and her having three children, and the king having many bastards. She is then told that all her children will die while she is still alive.

I dont think that necessarily means that the Jon we know needs to be in that scene. I personally think that the Tower of Joy ""flashback"" scene will be the opening scene. Possibly from Bran's point of view through the weirwood trees.

We've probably all heard that Sibel Kekilli has been seen on set in Mereen. So it appears Shae may be back, a totally unexpected event.)Many theories have been advanced. Mostly of the dream/flashback/fever dream variety. Or maybe she's just visiting friends on set? I suggested that maybe Shae was a Faceless Man. But as I think about it, I think it's exactly what it appears to be...Shae in Mereen.  


After *Varys* convinces Tyrion that Shae is in danger, we see Shae board a boat to Essos. And that's where she goes. The next time we see ""Shae"" is at Tyrions trial. But wait...isn't she in Essos? Yes she is. So who is this at the trial? THIS is the Faceless Man, not Shae. What is the end game of the FM? Well, how does the game end? Tywin is dead. Why is Tywin dead? Because Tyrion found ""Shae"" in his bed. Well played FM. Not sure who paid you to kill Tywin (Varys and his diamonds?) but it must have cost a lot.  


The nice part about this theory is that there will be a Tyrion/Shae reunion in Mereen. And Shae will learn that Tyrion always loved her. And Tyrion will learn that Shae didn't betray him. And we'll learn where whores go...Mereen.  


Anyways, I know there are probably many holes in this theory, which I'm sure I'll hear about (have at it). I just really want it to be true. It also suggests some very interesting things about Varys and the FM.",44,0,False,self,,,,,

We learned from tywins body that dead people stink. Jamie thinks about this in his first AFFC chapter. In the same chapter Jamie thought about Varys. Varys, the mysterious guy who lived in  Kings Landing who knows everything about everybody. In every book someone thought about his smell. His perfurme is very strong. What is when the perfume is only there to hide his smell? What if Varys has been dead for a very long time? He is a walking dead. What if Varys is Aegon the Conqueror?
  
- He has no hair on his head. Because his Targaryen white hair
- He knows about everything in Kings Landing and the Red Keep. Because he has lived there for a long time.
- Varys lied about his past. No one really knows about his past or since when he has been on court
- He takes on many identities
- His mysterious smell
- He treied to give the Targaryens the Throne.
- He sabotaged everyone who sits on the throne (Lannister, Baratheon, Tyrells)
  
Evidence against this theorie:
 - His eyecolour ist not purple.

So we all know that the nights watch killed Jon, what we don't know is what they're going to do with the body, since it wasn't the entire Watch that plotted to kill him, only a select few(correct me if I'm mistaken on that). We also know that they did this because they didn't agree with his support of the free folk, specifically bringing them past the wall. So my theory is that instead of having to hide his body or throw it over the wall so that the rest of the Watch don't find out what happened, they could simply blame the wildlings. They have been at war for thousands of year so it wouldn't be at all unbelievable that one of the wildlings took Jons kindness as an opportunity to take out the leader of the Knights Watch. Not only does this explain the dead body of the Lord Commander, but it also gives them a means to get the rest of the Watch to support them in getting rid of the Wildlings.

**Jon and Arya really like each other**

**Robb and Jon seem to be good bros too** 

**Cat can't stand Jon although she admits feeling bad for ""jinxing"" him when she wished he would get a decease or something** 

**Ned seems to like Jon as if he was a true son of his (I feel like)**

**Sansa and Arya ""fight"" a lot**

**Ned and Catelyn are true lovers**


In the books, are there any quotes that descrive the relation between other Stark family members?

I know this might seem like a really dumb question because since they are family, its normal for them to all get along but, mainly, what i want to know is if there is other relation like Jon-Arya that we didn't get to see on the show.

I'm rewatching season 1, and I'm puzzled as to why King Robert, while on his deathbed, tells everyone in the room to leave so he can speak to only Ned. He makes him write a letter essentially declaring Ned the one true King (until Joffrey is of age) and signs it.

At his death, Joffrey has valiantly taken the throne with his mother, Ned presents the letter with the unbroken seal of King Robert. Cersei tells Ned it's just a fucking paper, calls him a liar, rips it, kills his guards, it's over for Ned.

I was hoping someone could explain why King Robert wouldn't have said this in front of everyone in the room including Cersei and other important figures, he knew he was mere days if not hours away from his death. Instead he seals Neds fate in a letter. ",22,53,False,self,,,,,

Dany's three dragons are Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal; and we know the dragon must have three heads.

Drogon is described as ""black, his horns and spinal plates are blood red, and his eyes smoldering red pits"". The main color scheme here being black and red - reminiscent of the Targaryen words ""fire and blood"". This dragon is clearly Dany's.

Viserion is described as ""cream, but his horns, wing bones and spinal crest are gold colored. His teeth are shining black daggers. His eyes are two pools of molten gold and his flame is pale gold shot through with red and orange."" He is also often described as ""the white dragon"". White like snow. The gold possibly representing the crown of the prince that was promised; which would lead me to believe this dragon will eventually be controlled (ridden or warged) by Jon Snow.

Rhaegal is described as ""a dark green, the green of moss in the deep woods at dusk, just before the light fades, and they gleam like jade."" He is also sometimes referred to as ""the green beast"". Much like a certain greenseer and powerful warg that we know.

What do you guys think? Is there any significance to the color schemes that GRRM selected for his dragons?",9,5,False,self,,,,,

The GOT panel at New York Comic Con took place this afternoon with participation from Natalie Dormer (Margery), Finn Jones (Loras), and Keisha Castle-Hughes (Obara). One comment by Natalie Dormer stood out to me.

When asked if she thinks Margery could handle Cersei's walk of shame from last season, she said something to the effect of, ""We're getting into dangerous next season territory there!"" Sounds like confirmation of some kind of hazardous trial for Margery after her imprisonment on the show. That's particularly interesting because book Margery isn't in the Black Cells and only faces a trial judged by the Faith; could D&amp;B be setting her up for some unique show-only trauma, similar to Sansa?

On a less spoilery note, she also mentioned something she's said before, which is that she originally auditioned for another character but was instead offered the role of Margery. She said she won't say who until the show ends, but my money is on Melisandre.",16,13,False,self,,,,,

1. Is he really that good? Could he have put the Mountain down? 

2. How do you think he ranks in best fighters ever in Westeros/Essos.

3. Do you think Tywin would allow Jaime to fight for Tyrion in his trial by combat? I can't imagine how awesome it would be Jaime saving his little brother like that.

4. Does he have any military skills? In terms of commanding like this father or Stannis? I see theories about him going to take the Riveruns commanded by Cersei after she sees he failed to protect Myrcella. I believe he won't be fighting so he must be the general

There'd be a difference to other MMO's though. The goal wouldn't be to get best at PvP in the Arenas, or to kill the last boss in a Raid, it'd be to get the Iron Throne and sit there to rule. Perhaps you wouldn't want to over reach and just settle as the king of the north, but the main drive would be to conquer as much of Westeros without having your character killed - through marriage, politics or battle. Imagine having your daughter wedded with the head of the Lannisters only to hear Rains of Castamere play and be dead the next second, or storm the mudgates, like Stannis the Mannis. Obviously this would come with a lot of mechanical problems, and a lot of rethinking when it comes to the genre, but I wish this were where MMO's were heading.

Taking a closer look at this pic I noticed one character who seemed out of place. Look on the left hand side. A very non-Dothraki looking older guy on a horse, with a gray beard, over weight. Looks nothing like the Dothraki Warriors around him. So probably not an extra. Any thoughts on who it could be? It actually looks like Robert Baratheon on a horse! I know it isn't, but that's as physically close as I could get.

##3.09 - ""The Rains of Castamere""

* Directed By: David Nutter
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 2, 2013

Sam and Gilly arrive at the Wall. During a thunderstorm, Bran enters Hodor's mind to calm him down. Nearby, Jon refuses to kill an innocent man, so Tormund orders him killed. Bran uses his warg ability to save Jon, and Jon kills Orell then escapes, leaving a furious Ygritte behind. Osha, Rickon and his direwolf depart for the Last Hearth, while Bran and his remaining company plan to head beyond the Wall. Daenerys sends Jorah, Daario and Grey Worm to infiltrate Yunkai and open the city gate for her army. Yunkai soon falls to her forces. Robb arrives at the Twins and apologizes to Walder Frey, who feigns acceptance. Edmure marries Roslin Frey, but during the wedding feast, Walder Frey's men murder Catelyn, Talisa and most of the Stark bannermen, while Roose Bolton kills Robb. Arya also arrives at the Twins and witnesses a part of the massacre, but the Hound knocks her unconscious and carries her to safety.

---

##3.10 - ""Mhysa""

* Directed By: David Nutter
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: June 9, 2013

House Frey receives the Seat of Riverrun, Roose Bolton is appointed the new Warden of the North, resulting in a victory of House Lannister. Arya and the Hound witness Frey soldiers mocking the desecrated remains of Robb Stark. Arya stabs to death one of the men, marking the first time she kills a man, while the Hound kills the others. Yara Greyjoy begins a new military campaign to recapture Theon, who has been penectomized at Dreadfort by Lord Bolton's bastard son Ramsay Snow and begs for death in light of Snow's continued torture. Tywin chastises Tyrion for not having impregnated Sansa, and for placing his own desires over the needs of family. Jaime arrives in the capital with Brienne, and is reunited with Cersei. In the North, after crossing paths with Bran and guiding him beyond the Wall, Sam arrives back at Castle Black, where he and Maester Aemon send out ravens to alert the whole of Westeros about the arrival of the White Walkers. Ygritte catches up to Jon and tearfully shoots him full of arrows. Jon manages to escape and collapses before the gates of Castle Black, where Sam orders him to be cared for. At Dragonstone, Davos allows Gendry to escape and Stannis receives the distress call from the Night's Watch. After word from both Melisandre and Davos he now plans to move north and aid the Watch against the invading darkness. And across the Narrow Sea, the freed slaves of Yunkai receive Daenerys as their ""mhysa"", meaning ""mother"" in Ghiscari.

My question is: is this how it's supposed to be? I thought hardcover meant the cover art was printed on a hardcover. Have I received a bad copy? Am I supposed to glue this piece of paper to the cover myself? I'm really confused, as my other books have all been paperbacks.

If anyone has also bought it, or especially from amazon.de, could you please tell me if yours is the same? Appreciate it very much.

Recent set spoilers only add to the likelihood of this battle-- often referred to as ""Snowbowl""-- happening. And yes, I expect there to be a battle between the Boltons and the other Northern houses, just as much as I expect Jon Snow to return from the dead. However, I do not think that this battle will end with one side prevailing over the other; instead, I suspect that midway through the fighting, the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead will come south and surprise both sides. 

Here, the Boltons will have no choice but to stop fighting the other Northerners, and instead join forces to face the Others. Jon Snow, however, will immediately recognize the immense threat before him and command his armies to retreat. The Northerners will scatter and flee, with Jon himself bringing up the rear, urging them on with Longclaw. Many of the Northerners will perish, but a large portion will also escape into the Wolfswood. The Boltons, however, will be left alone behind Winterfell's walls, which will prove no match for the White Walkers and their army. This will effectively end the Boltons' occupation of Winterfell and send Jon (along with many Northern Houses, and quite possibly the wildlings) rushing South. It's even possible that they let Brienne of Tarth stick around in the North long enough to get to use that Valyrian steel sword of hers against the WW (otherwise, what purpose does going North in her show storyline serve?), but who knows.

Of course, for this to happen, the Wall would presumably need to come down at least a few episodes before the finale, so the timeline may be a little rushed to fit into season 6. That said, seeing two enemy armies have no choice but to stop fighting each other and start fighting together could be a potent microcosm of what needs to happen in the over-arching story of Westeros surviving the White Walkers' invasion. It would also be a way to make the Boltons pay for their wickedness, but without simply letting Jon win the battle and capture Winterfell (his home, and, if he is legitimized as a Stark, his castle) in a fairytale fantasy sort of way; the reality will thus be bittersweet, as Jon lives to fight another day but sees his hopes of ruling the North quickly dashed.

-&gt; He wanted to start a rebellion against the Lannisters without any proof (bran issue) until maester Luwin stopped him. ---&gt;He broke a sacred vow after becoming the King in the north, which is alright but couldn't he wait until the war got over to marry? there'd have been no risk of the Frey's then. 
-&gt; He constantly ignores Lord Bolton's and his mother's advice. Eg: Theon Greyjoy situation.
-&gt; He beheaded a Karstark for killing Lannister boys which led to him losing half his army. 

And after breaking vows, ignoring advice from his Bannerman, and beheading his own for killing the enemy did he actually think that anybody let alone the Frey's would support him? Bolton's and Frey's saw him for the fool he was and did what they had to do to protect their own, as this kid was never gonna beat Tywin Lannister.

""Kind of like Monty Python and the Holt Grail"" I replied

Confused, I explained what I thought would happen to each story line and major character, so here it is:

THE NORTH:

 - Jon - Will either stay dead or warg into his wolf, but will influence the story no more

 - Stannis - Will either turn out to be the chosen one in a twist or will take Winterfell and have wacky negotiations with the Northern lords

  - The White walkers - Will come to the Wall, realize neither them or the wights can climb a 700 foot wall made of ice with their bare hands, and either go home to drink some beer or just camp at the base of the wall forever, rendering the threat null and void.

- Bran flakes - Will return with Osha to Winterfell upon a unicorn from Skagos and become the next lord of winterfell

 - Roose - Will be hanged by his scrotum till it rips from him, then burned by the Mannis (interpret that any way you wish)

 - Ramsay - Dies the most painful death ever

THE 7 KINGDOMS:

 - Cersei - Will win her trial by combat with Robert strong, but somehow it will be revealed that Strong = the mountain and something bad will happen to Cersei. She will either end up dead or living as a peasant in exile.

 - Jaime - Will run off with Brienne, give up his sword and become the continents only one handed juggler, and will entertain the king in court, earning himself the name ""King-entertainer"" instead of kingslayer

 - Brienne - Will go off travelling with Jaime or something

 - Sansa - Will marry Robin, then become lady of the Vale when he dies

 - Sam - Will become a maester and end up saving his fathers life when he is injured, earning some respect from his dad

 - Littlefinger - After buying out debt from several notable houses, and having 3 kingdoms under his belt, Littlefinger is suddenly under investigation over the death of Lysa. Littlefinger then sends a raven for Saul Goodman, then realizing he does not exist in this universe, runs to find legal representation, then slips on a banana and dies the most insignificant way possible to juxtapose how powerful he was.

 - Gendry - Becomes lord of the stormlands by proving his legitimacy somehow, then forms alliances with the Vale and the North after Arya returns North, recreating this triple alliance.

 - The Blackfish - Joins the brotherhood and kills all the freys with them

 - Tommen - Exiles his mother after he privately finds out he is a bastard and after strong`s identity if revealed. Tommen will then remove the lion from his flag and rule as a pretty competent king along with Margerine. Without a lord, house Lannister will fade into obscurity.

 - Dorne - Will never end up going to war with the iron throne

 - Jon Connington - Will fail in taking storms end, return to Griffins roost a failure, lose his sellswords, and die of greyscale

 - Young Griff - Will die during the siege of storms end

 - Arya - Will realize she does not have what it takes to become a faceless man/woman and return north

MEREEN + ESSOS:

 - Dany - Meanders around Essos and will never get to Westros

 - Selmy - Will die in the battle of Mereen

 - Dario - Will turn out to be Euron, attempt to steal a dragon

I know i have left out approx. 2000 characters, but this is due to me not having any ideas about their fates.

So me general idea of how it will all end is that the armies will assemble, and then a huge anticlimax ensues. There are three ways that I think the story can end:

1) Huge battle

2) Huge anticlimax

3) Preston Jacobs genetics theory from his 8 or 9 part series

GRRM being GRRM, and not Tolkien, will almost certainly avoid the huge battle ending, and while Prestons theory is plausible, we only have 2 books left and trying to pull a twist that gargantuan would be impossible, thus i think the story will end in a huge climax to juxtapose the story itself.

Im probably spouting absolute nonsense, and am probably wrong about 99.1% of all of this, and the story will probably end in a completely different way, and you probably dont agree with me on any of this.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

On Oct 20 I will be starting a Read Along to A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Throne. Hopefully after this book I will continue to do the whole series.

I found a guide that should help readers find out where their chapter is in the book: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Chapters_Table_of_contents#A_Game_of_Thrones

So week one we are reading from the prologue until Sansa I, until chapter 15, which for me is on page 116, and for others might be 139 or 133.

Here's the official Read Along schedule for this book.

October 20: Prologue - Chapter 15 (Sansa I)

October 27: Chapter 16 (Eddard III) - Chapter 30 (Eddard VII)

November 3: Chapter 31 (Tyrion IV) - Chapter 45 (Eddard XII)

November 10: Chapter 46 (Daenerys V) - Chapter 60 (Jon VIII)

November 17: Chapter 61 (Daenrys VII) - Chapter 72 (Daenerys X)

If this any of this is at all confusing please feel free to ask for clarifications. If not, I hope to see some of you reading along on October 20.

Also, I searched but didn't find this posted before, so if it's a repost I apologize.

So I just watched all five seasons of GoT again and I noticed something.

In Season 1 Jon Snow gets Longclaw from Mormont. Longclaw being a bastard-sword.
Later, Shireen is talking about Balerion the Dread and says about him,  

&gt;His fangs were as long as bastard-swords  

This along with /u/jtd1776 [theory about Longclaw](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/388feg/spoilers_all_with_renewed_longclaw_hype_i_present/) it could support that after Jon comes back he gets a dragon and is has Blackfyre.

Also, since Kit has been seen filming, we definitely assume Jon comes back.  
My thought is that they attempt to burn him so he won't turn into a WW, but he doesn't get burned up because, ""A dragon cannot be killed by fire.""

But first the boy is taken from his home to live and serve his fathers enemies, next the new family that he has learned to love has fallen to pieces. Theon goes back to the only place he knows, his home on the Iron Islands. It's here that he learns that his father respects his sister more than him as a fighter. Basically Theons shit is going south. This is when Theon became my favorite character, his father gives him a handful of men and even less ships, but Theon won't earn respect or have any songs sung about him following his fathers orders. So he nuts up, becomes his own man and captures Winterfell. As a Stark fan, of course this felt wrong, but I couldn't help but respect the lad for capatalizing, and taking the north. Since then all of the nonsense with Ramsay and the Boltons takes place, and Theon is turned into a cockless, brainwashed, slave. Since then I've been waiting for his redemption, hoping that maybe he would do what Theon Greyjoy would do, not what Reek would do. When he passed up on slitting Ramsay's throat, and when he told Ramsay about the candle in the broken tower, it was a little more than hard to watch. The man who had once captured the great hold of Winterfell was reduced to nothing. However most recently, Theon seems to have found a way to get back to being Theon, helping what is left of his true family the Starks. I'm hoping that Theon can make a comeback to the man that Ned Stark made him into, before he became the monster that Ramsay Bolton made him. ",10,3,False,self,,,,,

Let's say for a non spoiler example...a Stark at Winterfell has found a Stark who has deserted the watch. His duty is to execute him for a traitor. But isn't this Kin-Slaying? 
Anyone have any thoughts on hierarchy of the supposed curses like guest right, kin slayer, oathbreaker etc. Just interested to hear as i'm not sure this is a solid fact based thing, and is more based on theory and belief but would be good to hear some thoughts.

[Image here if you need](http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/game-of-thrones-season-5-nights-king-hbo.jpg). Well I think this might be a form of warging.

With the whole Bran arc being about warg stuff that and the tree guy (forgot his name)... It seems possible that white walkers would in fact be extremely powerful wargs. Maybe they are the ""original"" wargs, and the humans with the ability to warg happen to have some blood in common with them (which might be possible, considering all the storyline with the Night's King being a human and falling in love with a white walker... maybe at some point some white walkers got childrens with humans or something). Note that the WW probably don't have any blood, but you get the point.

Look at the [eyes of Bran when warging](http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/game-of-thrones-season-5-nights-king-hbo.jpg) it's kinda similar to the white walkers. Not the same, true, but maybe as you get more powerful as a warg, this changes. aka ""This is not even my final form""

An interesting thing with that is also the fact that a lot of Bran chapters are mostly people warning him to not warg too much because his body needs to stay healthy and stuff. Well, maybe the white walkers, if they are warg, actually have these sort of ice-like bodies so they can warg most of the time. I think it's safe to say they don't need to eat, probably don't need to sleep either, their body just seem to be a simple case so they can do their stuff. It would make sense for a ""race"" of warging people to have way less body needs than mere humans.

So maybe human wargers inherited a part of the warging ability from them somehow, but since they are ""trapped"" in a human body, they can't take full advantage of it. At that point, you might think of tree guy (still can't remember his name) which seems to have this problem, since he ended up merging with trees to just do his stuff and stay ""alive"". He probably had to do that so he could attain higher levels of warging even though he didn't have the ideal white walker body for that.

Then maybe in the end, Bran's ""mission"" would be to sort of counter warg them somehow, to avoid the white walkers taking over the world. Considering he's already a cripple and all the crow talk, he will probably have to let go his body to become some sort of ultimate warg machine.

Edit: I also just found a quote from one of old Nan's stories: ""The wildlings... Their women lay with the Others during the long night to sire terrible half-human children"". Of course, this doesn't mean it actually happened but... all stories have some part of truth.

* Commonly associated with winter

* First appeared 8,000 years or so ago during The Long Night

* Speculated to come from The Land of Always Winter

* Rumored to either come with snowstorms or bring the cold with them. The latter seems to be portrayed on the show.

* Appear to shatter or melt after being slain (at least on the show) 

**Information about Ice Dragons:**

* Some fans believe an ice dragon is in the wall. On that note, Jon thinks about ice dragons from Old Nan's stories at least once (off the top of my mind) when going through the gate and thinks of them a few other times.

* It's mentioned in The World of Ice and Fire that Maester Margate suspects an ice dragon to be in Cannibal Bay.

* They can apparently be slain however, they either melt or shatter after being killed. Thus, it would be quite difficult to prove you slayed one.

* Martin once wrote a children's book called ""The Ice Dragon"" and it has been subject to speculation as to whether or not it is set within the ASOIAF world. I believe Martin has commented on it, regardless it seems interesting enough.

* ""When it flew overhead, it left in it's wake desolate cold and frozen land""

tl;dr: lands of always winter are always winter because there's an asshole ice dragon hanging out there. Or Winterfell. Or The Wall. As long as there's an ice dragon SOMEWHERE. They also seem to have something to do with WW.

Bonus tinfoil: The Last Hero slayed the previous ice dragon. What else would cause it to be winter for so long?

Edit: Info I forgot to add. The Ice Dragon also had dragon riders in it and in it the Ice Dragon defeated dragons (not sure how many, just remember that it's more than one). Ice Dragons are also supposed to grow larger than fire breathing dragons.",14,35,False,self,,,,,

Theon has been, in some form or another, a prisoner for most of his life. And since Ned's death, Sansa has been too. 
Now it seems they have finally gotten away from the worst possible place they could be.

However I'm speculating that in true GRRM style, Sansa and Theon head for the wall to find Jon. There's a reason Sansa found out last season that he was alive, and I think it is so she makes the journey there this season, although I think while she is heading north, Jon will head south, alive or dead, and there will be another near miss between the two, as there was with Bran and Jon twice.

Sansa and Theon get to the wall towards the end of the season, just as the White Walkers arrive.
The White Walkers kill Theon, but keep Sansa alive, as she is a stark, and having read other theory's on this subreddit, that could be important to them, maybe some sort of hostage situation to get to Jon.

I only think this because right now it just seems like they are FINALLY out of the woods, only to reach something even worse, and given Sansa's training in dealing with abusive captors, she may be able to help undo them from the inside.

Theon may or may not be with her, I only include him because they both jumped together. They may split up and Theon heads to the iron islands.

Littlefinger tells us that he lost the dagger to Tyrion in a bet. Catelyn and Tyrion encounter each other at a tavern and Catelyn takes Tyrion prisoner to answer for the attempted murder of her son. Catelyn takes Tyrion to her sister Lysa in Eyrie. Tyrion denies the accusation that he sent an assassin to attempt to kill Bran, and the matter is settled (legally anyway) in a duel to the death between one of Lysa's knights and Bronn (a mercenary Tyrion picked up at the tavern).

While the duel to the death may have settled matters in a primitive fantasy world, in the real world we all know that the outcome of a duel does not determine who was *actually* guilty. And there was *no* mention of the attempted assassination of Bran at any other point in Season 1 after the duel at Eyrie.

2. *Whose dagger was it really?*
3. *If the dagger wasn't Tyrion's, why did Littlefinger say it was Tyrion's? If the dagger was Tyrion's but someone stole it from Tyrion, why did they want this dagger specifically?*

I'd like any answers to be **justified using only the material in the show**, if possible. If it can only be answered using the book, then that constitutes an oversight on the part of the show's writers, IMO. From a Google search I found out that the book has an answer to this question but that answer was *clearly* not given in the show.

**If this question is answered in season 2 or later, please do not answer my question and instead just let me know that it is answered later.**

Now, I have only seen the show, never read the books so maybe the answer to my question may have been addressed on the books but I have seen all the seasons and I am pretty sure it hasn't been addressed there. SPOILERS FOLLOW.

So my question/theory is,knowing from later seasons that Bran is a warg. Even thought he didn't know it at the time would it have been possible that he was controlling Summer and Nymeria without him knowing or fully understanding?. Both times when they tried to kill him and then when Joffrey was swinging at Arya the direwolves sort of seem to come from nowhere.

He was in a coma and I don't know the specifics of how a ward takes control but it does seem that you need to be in some sort of trance and a coma would sort of fit that bill.

I might be swinging at nothing but air. Maybe it was just the Direwolves been awesome at protecting their owners, but the way they shot the ending of S1-E2 when Ned kills Lady and Bran wake up, made me think of it.

You could interpret the ending as the director wanting to contrast life and death, how one is taken away and another is given. But knowing what we know about Bran I wonder it there was something else there.

Let's get scientific on the world of ASOIAF:

1) I will detail a method of self procreation.

2) I will explain how it is achieved.

3) I will explain how it is a likely scenario for Dragons in our context.

4) My research will probably be spotty...


[This guy (well, gal)](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/asexual-lizards/) is a south western whiptail lizard. They're a species of ONLY females that reproduce through a process known as [Parthenogenesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis). This quality allows the whiptail to procreate without the need of another individual.  

The whiptail, through this process, has the ability to cross chromosomes and to reproduce without sex and without the maladies most common in asexual or genetically thin reproductive options. This has allowed the species to thrive in its specific environment quite well. However, this form of reproduction is not well prepared for a rapidly changing environment, such as that of one at the mercy of human population 

How does this fit into GRRM's world? Well, I think he might almost be the genius we hate/love him for being; from a scientific perspective, this makes excellent sense for a species of region specific creatures in a fantasy world. The dragons were discovered in a particular place in Essos and were raised by the people who discovered them. They were, for all accounts, ""domesticated"" to the best of the ability of their handlers and used as a tool for war. As war spread and the wealth of the nation of their handlers grew, so too did the environment in which the dragons were found undergo radical change. Rapid development, depletion and redirection of natural resources, the reforming and repurposing of land... these are highly stressful, high impact changes to make against what was likely a unique and mostly unchanged environment. Parthenogenesis in dragons would make it nearly impossible for humans of the age in context to ""sex"" them, and would also help explain why they died out and were unable to ""breed"". Imagine, after the Doom and the conquering of Westeros, a radically different environment, the dragons would not have had the time to adapt in order to successfully continue to reproduce. This simultaneously explains their dwindling numbers and size until they became ""extinct"" in the world. It also lends to the mystery surrounding how they breed and why men were unsuccessful and unable to get them to do so, I would imagine this phenomenon to be beyond the understanding of men in ASOIF. 

TL;DR the dragons don't need to bone, can essentially bone self. The changes in environment were too great to allow them to adapt, so they died. Also why it's hard to know ""male"" or ""female"".",11,10,False,self,,,,,

Ok so i got a theory of a GOT ending.. Keep in mind that this ending is kind of sad or upseting but here is my theory. At the end of season 5 we see the betrayal of the watch towards Jon Snow. They stab him 6 times in the stomach. That is pretty much lethal considering the medical help at that age. So Jon dies. As we can see the watch members that killed Jon leave, letting Jon bleed to death. It's night so if they go to sleep they pretty much leave his body there for hours. That could be enough time for Jon to turn into a walker. Jon finds a way to leave the watch and find the rest of the walkers. Now let's back off a little. Jon fought the walkers on the battle where they were trying to save the wildlinks. If you noticed in that battle Jon defeated one of the commanders. As you can see from this highlight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC1dVsTkmSI (Skip to 3:10). He kills the walker and then the King or whatever he is looks at him like he is impressed (that happens at 3:30). My theory end with this.. Jon joins the walkers but the king fights him. So Walker Jon kills him and takes his place as the king of walkers. A friend of mine told me that George RR Martin mentioned that Jon snow will be the king at the end... So Jon becomes a king of walkers and attacks the wall. White walkers are only weak against Valyrian steel and dragon glass (at least the stronger ones). There are only 4 Valyrian swords in the world and limited dragon glass... so walkers take over the world and Jon is the king.. I know it's a bad ending but a solid theory :).

Wouldn't it be so crazy if Georgey orchestrated the ending of the book so that Varys sits on the throne?

##4.01 - ""Two Swords""

* Directed By: D. B. Weiss
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 6, 2014

Tywin Lannister oversees the reforging of Ice, the Stark ancestral sword, into two new swords. He gives one to his son Jaime, who tries and fails to return to his earlier life before the loss of his sword hand. Prince Oberyn, on behalf of his brother, Prince Doran Martell of Dorne, arrives in King's Landing with his paramour Ellaria Sand to attend the royal wedding and is welcomed by Tyrion Lannister. Oberyn openly reveals to Tyrion his motive for his visit: revenge against the Lannisters for the rape and murder of his sister, Elia, wife of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. In the North, while Styr and his group of cannibal Thenns reinforce Tormund Giantsbane, Ygritte and the other wildlings, Jon Snow has returned to Castle Black and is released by Maester Aemon after confessing what he did during his time with the wildlings to gain information. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen leads her army on a march towards Meereen, the last of the three great slave cities, though she is troubled by how her dragons become less tame as they grow. In the Riverlands, Arya, accompanied by Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane, reclaims her sword Needle from Polliver, and uses it to kill him the same way he murdered Lommy Greenhands, as retribution for her friend.

##4.02 - ""The Lion and the Rose""

* Directed By: Alex Graves
* Written By: George R. R. Martin
* Originally Aired: April 13, 2014

Roose Bolton returns to the Dreadfort to meet up with his bastard son Ramsay Snow and sees firsthand how Theon Greyjoy has been brutalized into a subservient persona called 'Reek'. His next objective is to find and kill the remaining Stark children, Bran and Rickon, who threaten the legitimacy of his new title, as well as reclaiming the territories under Ironborn occupation. Beyond the Wall, the visions of the Three-eyed Raven compel Bran and his companions to travel further northwards, despite growing hunger. At Dragonstone, Melisandre orders several people to be burned as a tribute to the Lord of Light, to the delight of Queen Selyse and the disgust of Davos and Shireen. In King's Landing, Tyrion ends his relationship with Shae to protect her from his family and arranges for her to be shipped off to Pentos. Jaime begins discreetly training his left-handed swordplay with the help of Bronn. Later at the Royal Wedding feast, tensions grow between Joffrey and Tyrion. The feast is abruptly cut short when Joffrey succumbs to poisoned wine and dies. A grief-stricken Cersei accuses Tyrion of murdering the king and orders his arrest.

Like how when Aegon came to conquer Westeros, it was split up into different kingdoms. It's kind of in a similar situation right now, with everyone climbing for power. It seems as if Westeros is only joined together in theory. The north is more under the control of Boltons than Tommen. Dorne doesn't care that much, Renly and then Stannis had the storm lands under their control. The Greyjoys are actively trying to take over so they've separated themselves from Kings landing. So when Dany gets to westeros with her three dragons what if the way she conquers is very similar to how Aegon conquered it. 

Lannister &amp; Tyrell's will attack her trying to keep her power - with Cersei in charge, maybe she'll cause Kings Landing to be burned down by dragon fire. Tommen dies in the fighting. The Tyrells then turn over the Kings Landing to Dany at the last minute. And someone chokes Cersei during all of the fighting.

The Freys' sit in their castle, waiting out the fighting and are roasted alive as a dragon lights it on fire. The Tully's or someone else then bend the knee

In the Vale, Robin hands over his kingdom for a ride on a dragon.

After seeing all the destruction, whoever is in charge in the North bends the knee, so they can solve the bigger problem of the white walkers. 

When most of Westeros is in ruins from the fighting, the white walkers come starting the long night, and the war for dawn happens. 

***North - to take it a step further, the north right now is also very divided, like it was before the Stark Rule. With the Season 6 leak about a big battle, it can be seen to mimic how the Stark's took over the north to stop the Ironman. ",13,7,False,self,,,,,

If your reasoning for liking a character has major spoilers from later on, please spoiler warning them. And like I said, must not be universally liked. So no Tyrion, Margaery, Bronn, Arya, etc. On to my answer. I personally think that Tywin Lannister gets no credit for the shit he has to do. Let's be honest, you don't get to where the Lannisters are by being nice to everyone all the time. But you also don't need to be unreasonably cruel. Every single decision Tywin makes is for the bettering of the realm and the Lannister's position. For example: He arranges marriages for Tyrion and Cersei despite both of their complaints because he knows that those marriages will help gain allies and spread influence; on the flip side, he condemns the pointless torturing of prisoners because he knows that using prisoners for work is a far more useful way to deal with prisoners than focusing time and effort on making them suffer. He's smart enough to know that emotion and politics do not mix well and lead to unpleasant consequences. He's also the most orthodox character in the show, and even though its not appreciated by people, it is unreasonable that everyone in a pseudo-medieval setting would be subverting their positions at every turn without someone getting upset. He got to his position of being the man truly in charge of the kingdom by being cold, calculating, and certainly not brash.",25,3,False,self,,,,,

All theory below.

**Roose Bolton**- to me, I feel like this guy is just too cunning to die until the finale. if he does go down, it'll probly be at the hand of Jon Snow from an epic sword fight. I feel like that will be the ultimate fan payback, even though this show isn't about fulfilling the best possible outcomes. 

**Ramsay Bolton**- tbh, I could care less if he survived, he feels like the only character on the show that acts without motivation. Just is a natural born asshole, which is vapid. i like how he's so unpredictable and is basically one of those characters who just ""wont die"" because they're a badass, but again, he's just a natural born asshole, unlike his father who actually has a reason to be the way he is. 

**Theon** (Wreak)- so much has been taken from him it feels hard to connect with him now. will probly die defending sansa or something similar for the starks. maybe when he reconnects with Jon, if ever. 

**Walder Frey**- probly gonna get it in the worst way possible but i honestly cant imagine what that is since he seems to give no fucks. 

**Bra**n- heard he wargs into a dragon?

**Rickon**- no clue. 

**Hodor**- heard a theory that he's the red god. When I asked why they replied with, ""logic"" -_-

**Melisandre**- i feel like she's so mixed up with the red god or lord of light, whatever, that something ridiculous will come about that will shock even her and subsequently cause her death, perhaps the red god himself. idk....

**Ser Davos**- i like him and i see him joining Jon Snow.

**Sam**- feel like he's a character that ""can't"" die for story purposes. he'll obviously be there for a while since he goes to the citadel to study about the white walkers. 

**Arya**- blind now, so wtf she gonna do now? use echolocation?

**Brianne**- killed stannis, so who will kill her?

**Jon Snow**- Obviously not dead, but if brought back to life like Beric and Thyros or whatever his name is, what will happen? Gets revenge on the nights watch?

I know the books end where Jon is betrayed so this is pure speculation. ",18,0,False,self,,,,,

Jon snow, theorized as azzor assai reborn, must have his sword right? Jons sword will be oathkeeper, impowered by Caitlyn's Starks sacrifice(as he shall have no wife), keeping her broken oath that she feels has cursed her family, to love Jon snow as a son. And since Caitlyn is alive from an unnatural life fire granted by the lord of light, he calls it simply fire. So the whole series is about how the sword of the north ice, becomes the sword that shall be called fire.(and how Jon wields it of course) *as a footnote you can tell a true dragon of the targaryn line, because the same way a blood sacrifice was required to birth a dragon, so must something die when they are born to initiate the magic of making them a 'dragon'.

Why the hell do I love Game of Thrones so much? Whenever I ask someone if they like GoT, usually the answer never goes beyond ""Yeah, I love it"", ""I like it because It's so awesome"", ""It's great. The characters are badass!"" or something along those lines.


Personally I have never felt such strong emotions for a tv series in my life but I honestly have no ideia why it strucks me like that.

It's pretty much just a medieval-like fantasy story like many others out there. I'm usually not a fan of CGI/fantasy stuff like dragons and such. To add to that, I actually have strong feelings of dislike towards most of the characters (I think Bronn is pretty much the only cool guy in the show). So at first glance, it should be something that I wouldn't really enjoy but it turns out to be the exact opposite.


Looking forward to hear your opinions on this!

**The Prophecy**

""He laboured for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer""


 - Now my tinfoil is that since Ygritte is dead, the only person who I can think Jon loves the most who 'HE' thinks is still alive is Ghost. Ghost is his most loyal companion and my theory is when the end is near Jon will not want to kill him but realises it what's best to save the seven kingdoms and he will kill Ghost will Longclaw, and once he pulls it out of his direwolf and goes into battle the eyes of the wolf on the sword will glow red just like Ghost's and the sword will glimmer red as he goes into battle.

I also think this could be a possibility since GRRM has said the ending will be bitter sweet, what's not more bitter sweet than saving the seven kingdoms but killing the one you love/adore someone who is loyal, and as for us, could you imagine watching that scene most of us will be in tears myself included.

TLDR: Jon will kill Ghost not because he wants to but he realises it has to be done create Lightbringer and face the others ",14,0,False,self,,,,,

Obviously, horses are domesticated in Westeros and people use them for transportation. Additionally, there are the Direwolves (including the ones that the Starks own). However, are there any normal dogs in Westeros (either in the TV show or the books)? Seeing as Sandor is called the Hound, clearly there are some sort of dogs - but are these dogs that we would be familiar with, or some sort of imaginary breed/hybrid?

I'm new here and haven't checked.

So, in the episode we see Jon Snow kill a White Walker with Longclaw; a Valyrian steel sword. Now, the contents of Valyrian Steel are mysterious with little known about it( I saw a well thought out theory that it contained Dragon Bone but GRRM has since said it doesn't)but we do know it's properties. It is ridiculously sharp and strong, yet very light and requires no maintenance but another, less known property is that it can kill White Walkers and the only other material we know of that can kill White Walkers is Dragonglass or obsidian. I propose that obsidian is a key component in Valyrian steel. Real life obsidian is very sharp and rather light, but quite brittle. Tell me what you think or if this is just a load of bollocks.

Varamyr talked about forgetting oneself after residing in another skin for so long, especially when it comes to certain animals.

##4.03 - ""Breaker of Chains""

* Directed By: Alex Graves
* Written By: David Benioff &amp; D. B. Weiss
* Originally Aired: April 20, 2014

Tyrion is immediately arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of Joffrey's murder while Tywin begins to groom Tommen to be the next king and enlists Oberyn Martell and Mace Tyrell as judges for Tyrion's impending trial, though Oberyn's hatred of the Lannisters makes him mistrustful of Tywin. Meanwhile, Sansa is smuggled out of King's Landing with the help of the fool and former knight Dontos Hollard, who brings her to Petyr Baelish's ship, before Baelish kills him to silence him. In the Riverlands, Arya and the Hound continue their journey, where they meet a kind farmer and his daughter. However, the Hound robs the farmer, much to Arya's shock. At Dragonstone, Davos tries to figure out how to replenish Stannis' depleted forces, and requests a loan from the Iron Bank of Braavos to pay for a new army. In the North, Sam, fearing for Gilly's safety, has her moved out of Castle Black to Mole's Town, despite Gilly's desire to stay. Meanwhile, the wildlings continue to raid northern villages. Jon warns them that the wildlings want to lure the Night's Watch brothers out of Castle Black, and they should instead focus on fortifying their defenses. However, they soon receive word that a band of Night's Watch mutineers have set up camp at Craster's Keep. Jon tells the Night's Watch to organize a party to attack the mutineers, as they cannot risk having any information about the weakness of Castle Black's defenses leak to Mance Rayder's approaching army. At Meereen, Daenerys lays siege to the city, and after Daario defeats Meereen's champion, she tells the slaves to rise up against their masters.

##4.04 - ""Oathkeeper""

* Directed By: Michelle MacLaren
* Written By: Bryan Cogman
* Originally Aired: April 27, 2014

Daenerys successfully captures Meereen amidst a slave revolt, and immediately seeks justice for the slain slave children by nailing 163 masters to posts. At sea, Petyr admits to Sansa that he was responsible for poisoning Joffrey, despite his alliance with the Lannisters. In King's Landing, Olenna also intimates to Margaery that she ordered the poisoning, and encourages Margaery to seduce Tommen before Cersei has a chance to turn him against her. Jaime meets with Tyrion, and is convinced he is not guilty. However, Cersei is adamant about Tyrion's guilt, and orders Jaime to hunt down and kill Sansa. Jaime instead tasks Brienne with finding and protecting Sansa, and sends Podrick along with her. In the North, in an effort to get rid of Jon, Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt conspire to allow Jon to lead an expedition against the Night's Watch mutineers occupying Craster's Keep. Meanwhile, Bran and his party stumble upon Craster's Keep, where they are captured by the mutineers, and Bran is forced to reveal his identity to them. Further north, a White Walker takes Craster's last newborn son to a secret ritual site, where another White Walker touches the baby's face, turning its eyes blue.

1289,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-10-26,2015,10,26,10,3q7y84,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] A Quote From Jojen Reed (S03E10) Might Predict The Future of Westeros?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3q7y84/all_spoilers_a_quote_from_jojen_reed_s03e10_might/,RedditAlreadyDidIt,1445821750,"**S03E10** - When bumping into Sam, Gilly and Little Sam, Bran asks Sam to take him and his traveling companions North of The Wall. After a brief hesitation Sam asks *""why would you want to?""* and *""What I know, is what I saw. And if you saw it too you'd run the other way""* and Jojen then speaks his line. *Sorry I cannot find a link on YouTube to the scene.* 

&gt; *""You saw the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead. The Nights Watch can't stop them, the Kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.""*

So we, along with Sam get the indication that they intend to stop the cold from covering Westeros. We know now that Jojen can see the future via his greensight, so does that mean he has seen a vision where Bran, Hodor and their little gang can defeat the cold winds of winter? Possibly;

**1) Jojen sees Bran warg a Dragon;**

This has the indication the Jojen also knows that the last remaining Targaryen is in Essos, and possibly even seeing her future to conquer Westeros. It's also believed by some of us fans that this version of events is the tale of Azor Ahai reborn to defeat the Walkers. 

*How it will go down;*

Jojen takes Bran to Bloodraven, he then teaches Bran about warging and greensight, Dany comes to Westeros with her Dragons, Bran eventually wargs into a dragon, Bran saves [Westeros.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3Awl_5c8jI)

**2) Jojen sees White Walkers with Bran;**

This one is a bit tricky. Jojen sees a bunch of stuff that happens in the future, and we hardly get a glimpse of the White Walkers but what if, it is possible for Bran to warg into a White Walker and defeat them in their own backyard? We see Bran warg into simple animals like birds, and we know that wargers can get into the minds of creatures bigger than they are eg Varamyr Six-Skins can warg into many including a snow bear and Bran into Hodor, and we have seen Bran warg into mythical creatures - the Direwolfs. So is it possible he could get into the mind of another mythical and magical creature?

If taking Bran to Bloodraven is important for him to learn these skills and we don't see many animals in the North itself. Especially the ice-cold northern lands, then what is Bran suppose to Warg into? True that there is a murder of crows there along with them, but Bran needs to learn a deeper power to his abilities and warging into the same little bird isn't possibly the case to grow stronger. 

**3) Jojen sees His Adventure**

So, there is a possibility that Jojen see's everybody's lives and where they should end up. Meaning, and indicated by Bloodraven that he knew this adventure would mean his demise. But did he see anything after his own death? Could Jojen somehow be somewhere in the Old Gods tree network to watch over and guide Bran and his sister? I'm not too sure if Bloodraven can see the future but we know that Jojen can, and with Jojen's powerful mind, despite it taking a toll on is body every now and then, is one to consider. 

If Jojen's mind and power, somehow in all of its magical aspects, leave Jojen's body and make its way into the Network of the Old God's then he could still very much so lend a hand to Bran and Hodor and his sister Meera. After all, he wouldn't have taken them to Bloodraven if he knew Bloodraven couldn't help them as much or more than he can. 

OR, he could see nothing after his own death. A total darkness, a night forever. For the Night is Dark and Full of Terrors. 


One of these could very well be the vision of the future, is there something I have missed? Perhaps a 4th possibility? What do you think?

That aside, I have yet to see an actual solid argument on why the raid doesn't make any sense.

Here are the facts:

- The Baratheon soldiers were all shitting themselves, it was dark and freezing like shit plus they were hungry.

- They weren't used to the northern conditions and totally underestimated the weather.

- It's being implied that guards apparently were sleeping (as they would with their bad conditions).

- They were riders that burned tents and then rode away immediately (probably killing some soldiers on the way back).

- They were noticed while escaping obviously, thus Davos making up a vague number of raiders.

If you look at this totally unbiased, is it really rational to say that this couldn't be possible? The only arguments I've seen (and believe me there aren't many more and it seems like people just bandwagon on them all) are that it just doesn't make sense (without any example why) or that its plotarmor for Ramsay and the Boltons (which is obvious Stannis bias because you could make the same argument for Stannis if he were to win, since Boltons numbers for a battle and a siege were better)

I still think Stannis' end was obviously rushed, same as other storylines, but I just think people expected way too much of him in the show especially how bad the conditions already were.

She's presented as a young girl, possibly way in over her head, and one interpretation of what happens to her and Roose Bolton is that he brutally rapes her. This is not what contemporary society thinks should happen to girls of Sansa's age. 

What I don't understand, for the life of me, is why this is presented as a big deal IN-UNIVERSE. On numerous levels. Let me explain. 

The first can be summed up with ""**well what the hell did she think was going to happen?**"" 

For a season and a half now, Littlefinger had been grooming Sansa into a savvy femme fatale. To be fair - with mixed results. So mixed, in fact, that when he tells her ""hey you can go marry Roose Bolton, get close to the Boltons, and then kill them all,"" she doesn't immediately think this is a great idea. But by that episode's end, she agrees that this is what she must do. Marry Roose, the evilest man in the kingdom. Get close to him. And then kill him. So why the hell is she so distraught when it turns out that Roose... wants to... ... have sex with her? As presented in the TV series, **their sex barely qualifies as rough or kinky. It's certainly got nothing on 50 Shades of Grey**, which is kind of striking because Westeros is a couple of centuries behind 50 Shades of Grey in terms of human rights issues. 

I can imagine two counter-arguments - **the first is that she only agreed with Littlefinger's plan because she felt so threatened by Littlefinger**. The scenes with Brienne early in the season suggest that she no longer thinks of him as a purely benevolent force in her life. But think... just how threatened would she have to feel by Littlefinger to agree to MARRY INTO THE BOLTON FAMILY? OK, he's menacing. He has a hidden agenda. But did he kill Catelyn Stark? Robb Stark? Massacre Winterfell armies? Invade Winterfell lands? The only reason to marry Roose is that Sansa fears Littlefinger more than the Boltons, and I see absolutely no reason on the show why that should be the case. She might distrust him deeply, but she had absolutely nothing to lose by calling his bluff (?) that he wouldn't force her to marry Roose if she didn't want to. What's the worst that could happen? Littlefinger would say ""I lied, I'll force you,"" and she ends up in exactly the same place? This is not a satisfactory explanation. 

The second counter-argument is that **Sansa really did believe she could handle this femme fatale business, but when it came down to it and she found herself in the heart of darkness**, she realized that she's still a young girl who's in way over her head. **And I gotta call bullshit on that.** It completely negates all of her character development over the past two seasons by turning her back into a victim instead of a proactive agent. So this isn't a satisfactory explanation either. 

What happens to Sansa is exactly what she might have predicted would happen. 

We - contemporary audiences - have plenty of reason to be distraught at seeing it. She's a minor who's been thrust into the belly of an evil beast, she's being taken advantage of physically and emotionally by her sociopath husband. This is all very bad.

The problem is **Sansa shouldn't agree with us**. Sansa Stark is seventeen years old on the show. By medieval European standards, she is VERY overdue to be married and used for procreational purposes. Yes, this hurts our modern-day sensibilities, but as a character living in Westeros, Sansa has no reason whatsoever to be under the delusion that she's going to wed Prince Charming and live happily ever after. Maybe she did back in the pilot, but it's been a while since the pilot, hasn't it? Yes, Roose Bolton is the evilest man in all of Westeros, but that's only because Joffrey is dead. And Sansa saw Joffrey's evil first-hand, more than anyone else. The show wants audiences to think that Roose has topped Joffrey? By killing a random friendly old woman, when Joffrey had her father executed? By having Theon watch them have ambiguously non-consensual sex (by medieval standards)? Not only that, but let's not forget that after Joffrey passed Sansa up, she was immediately betrothed to Tirion. Sansa should have a very good idea now what other people expect of her. And while that doesn't excuse their behavior in any way by our modern day standards, I don't see why any of this should have reduced Sansa to s1 levels of victimhood the way it did on the show. 

**Sansa's attitude throughout the Winterfell story arc seems to be that of a 21st century girl who's lived a pretty average life and has no reason to expect bad things to happen to her, and has no idea why she's in Winterfell at all.** It certainly doesn't account for the fact that she planned to go there, planned to hang out among very bad people and planned to somehow get them all killed. And it doesn't account for the fact that she's hung out with worse. She survived Joffrey, and then grew as a character. There's no reason for someone as bad as Joffrey to give her as much trouble now, as Joffrey did back when she was a weak, spoiled, naive little girl. 

Not only are the consequences of Sansa's decisions inane and dismissive of her character development, but - what's worse - the show sensationalizes and vilifies medieval marital practices (which were always ambiguously consensual) in a way that's completely inconsistent with how it's treated similar material in the past. The way Khal Drogo forced himself on s1 Dani was objectively worse; Dani was both younger than Sansa and an unwilling participant in their marriage. But the show did not dwell on Dani's questionable sex life, it transformed her into a character who takes control of her own fate. Sansa, older, wiser, and an active participant in her marriage with Roose, is reduced to a traumatized, confused girl who has no idea why she's in Winterfell and why she's having sex with her husband. Instead of writing a strong character, the showrunners went for cheap, sensational headlines. **I don't blame viewers for letting them get away with it. I blame the showrunners for exploiting our 21st century sensibilities for easy, lazy drama.**",17,0,False,self,,,,,

If anything The Wall more closely resembles, in how it influences the story, the English Channel.

While reading A Distant Mirror, I kept getting reminded of ASOIAF. There are a lot of little things. A pain-in-the-ass noble get killed by a boar during a hunt, another is obsessed with his hounds, tons of Knights fighting each other all the damn time, hands getting chopped off, lots of people burn to death in weird ways, the Church is split and there are two Popes, but here's the one that convinced me:

Without going into spoilers for that show, I will say that the website The Spoiling Dead Fans spoiled a very major and bloody event that was unexpected. Many people were shocked when this turned out to be true. TSDF have spoiled every episode for the last two seasons of TWD, and provide explicit details of shooting, cast details, and filming locations and events. 

My GoT related question is: is there a similar site for this series? I want to hear/see every spoiler I can. I understand most people can't stand them, but I just don't work the same way. I know there is WatchersontheWall, but they tend to go easy on explicit details and don't update quite as frequently. That's fine, but I for one would like more.

I watched this again (for the 50th time probably) and I realised that Ned only allowed the kids to take the wolves because Jon convinced him. Ned's youngest son asked him, his oldest son obviously didn't want them killed. It was Jon, his supposed bastard, that convinced him to let the kids keep the wolves and it looked like a hard decision for Ned to make, he looked pretty pissed/upset. 

This just further cements Jon's importance for me. [Theory](#g ""We're all convinced he's Lyanna's son, but neither the books nor the show have actually confirmed this yet."") Jon's thoughts and feelings matter to Ned more than his own sons (to a point) and if something is important enough to change Ned's mind, it likely very much is. ",14,4,False,self,,,,,

Accidentally found this, don't think it's been posted before. It's obvious why Martin chose the name. I dug a little deeper, and learned that the Welsh people and language are descended from the original inhabitants of Britain, corresponding to the ""First Men"" that occupied Westeros before the arrival of the Andals. Northerners are partially descended from the first men, and I would imagine that Welsh people are at least partially descended from the Romanized Celts that lived in Britain prior to the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons. The Celts worshiped sacred groves of trees called ""Nemeta"", which seems very similar to the religion of the old Gods that Northerners practice. ",14,145,False,self,,,,,
