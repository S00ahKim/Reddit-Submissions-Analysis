Spoilers and speculation abound!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/mvyh4/just_finished_adwd_spoilers_and_speculation_abound/,pikpikcarrotmon,1322729758,"First, let me get this out of the way:

FUCK. **FUCK**, **FUCK**, ***MOTHERFUCKER***!

Now that I've sent this fucking book to R'hllor and used its pages to clean myself after reading the epilogue, I feel calm enough to discuss it.  I suppose I deserved this for being a Frey, but that's for another day.

So... the Martells are going to have to throw in with Aegon because literally all of their other prospects have died in agonizing pain, the Tyrells now rule the continent (and does anyone else have a hard time shaking the image of Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Tyrell?  I know it's completely absurd considering that his children are whiter than Snow, but I can't get it out of my head), Brienne is leading Jaime to be killed by the Brotherhood Without Banners, and with the deaths of Jon (SHITSHITMOTHERFUCKINGGODDAMN) and Ser Kevan, all semblance of honor and order has disappeared from the realm... how am I supposed to believe this series can end in two more books!?

At least I can mouse over all those juicy red spoilers, but DO I EVEN WANT TO ANYMORE?

Anyway... thoughts.

1. Stannis isn't dead.  Melisandre's chapter didn't seem to hint at that at all, and she would have known before anyone else.  This much is a bluff by Ramsay.  Also, no word from Roose and co.  I don't think that battle went half as well as Ramsay says - after all, if he'd beaten Stannis, he would have found Asha, Theon, and ~~Jeyne~~ Arya.

2. Samwell, Sansa, where are you?  Jaquen is running wild in Oldtown and Littlefinger is being Littlefinger in the Vale.  I'm sure something has happened with them since we last read in AFFC.

3. Daenerys... Her hair and hands are *burned*.  She is not half the dragon she used to be.  I have a feeling that she's been a red herring all along, just a way for the dragons to be raised and trained, but it's Aegon who seems like the real Targaryen.  Daenerys is just too simple and naive.  That leaves us with two empty dragons.  Arianne, perhaps?  She seems too minor, but marrying her to Aegon is House Martell's only hope.  I also wonder if the remaining wargable Starks won't be sharing bodies with dragons sometime.  Bran is kind of taken, Arya and Rickon are well available, Sansa doesn't seem to have the gift, and JON WHO ISN'T DEAD AND WARGED INTO GHOST is also eligible.

4.  Why so much love around here for Manderly?  That subplot doesn't seem to have gone anywhere yet.  The only thing Manderly did to impress me was block a killing blow with his throat folds.  Every time he was in a scene I expected him to start talking about diabeetus.

5.  Victarion makes me want to defect to House Greyjoy, but Theon's still in it somehow.  This is a huge dilemma.

6.  Varys is a gangsta.

7.  Is there really any reason not to follow R'hllor at this point?  He is the only god that actually gets shit done.  Pray to the old gods, lose your head.  Pray to the Seven, lose your kingdom.  Pray to R'hllor, predict the future claim immunity to disease never get sleepy resurrect the dead murder kings in their castles....",14,11,False,self,,,,,

Simply learning about life and science and theology (as well as rolling my eyes at every religious wacko out there) has brought me to the brink of hethanism. Reading these have all but put the nail in the coffin that will rot in the ground turning me and my soul into worm food.

I shall explain, reading this book and seeing all of these characters who believe in their wide and varied deitys so devoutly just sort of made me go, ""Huh, they all believe that they're right and none of the hundreds of other religions (built upon equally as flimsy logic) with just as many followers are wrong.... That's really silly."" 

I'm sure any number of other books would have made the same parallells and lead me to the same conclusion. It's not like Martin set out to do that, but this series is doing that.

[minor spoilers inside],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/mxk6x/wont_it_be_weird_when_some_of_these_actors_age/,[deleted],1322838293,"Just occurred to me that, assuming they keep the same cast throughout (difficult enough to do in and of itself), even if they essentially film a book for year for the series and even if they film the split seasons back-to-back, some of these actors/actresses may look much too old for their roles by the time the series catches up to the books.

For example (and covering with spoilers for all books just in case you don't want to know who's still alive toward the tail end of the series)...

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""Bran looks to be about 11 or 12 now...could be staring down 17 or 18, maybe even more should this series film to completion.  Going to be odd seeing an adult play Bran, essentially."")

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""Arya could be closer to 20, which like Bran would take away from her character a bit.  I guess the performance is the most important part, but it's hard to imagine Bran/Arya not being kids in this story."")

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""By the time Tommen plays any significant role, assuming they retain the same actor and I'm not sure they do as he didn't even have any speaking lines in season one, he would be likely staring at 14 or 15, which feels more like Joffrey's age than anything, and wouldn't really serve to differentiate between Tommen and Joff"")

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""On that note, there's a potential for Joffrey to end up looking a bit too old for the part a la the guy who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter series."")

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""Don't think we'll see much of a difference with characters like Dany, Sansa and Jon Snow, though."")

Just thinking down the road, could be odd for some of these characters.  I guess the story and performances are what matter, but it's going to be strange imagining them as one age or actually seeing them as one age in the first season, and then fast-forwarding to how much their character's looks will change if we ever get to the series' conclusion.",8,0,False,default,,,,,

Of course a lot depends on revelations in the next couple books but potentially a love triangle, or I suppose a square/pentagon?, between [FfC I think?](/b ""Cersei and Rhaegar, Rhaegar and Lyanna and Robert""). Audiences love that type of stuff. And then you can have a big budget battle at the trident with badass Robert in his stag armor and then the [Book Spoiler](/b ""intense kingsguard vs Stark's men swordfight at the ToJ""). 

With GRRM on board, they can probably flesh out the story even more and we'd get some more insight on Robert's Rebellion that probably would have otherwise been irrelevant in seven books. 

For the studio, it would make sense. They would have finished their run with the books after (hopefully) seasons and seasons of successful TV and they would be looking for a way for this franchise to keep going and it would be to early for a reboot. They'd probably cast a lot of new, young actors and play up the relationship side of the movie to appeal to a large audience.

So my question is what happens when the TV series catches up to the books? Because GRRM is so heavily engaged as a writer and producer of the series one has to wonder if he would not finish the series on television and follow up with the books later.

It's possible that right now Dany's dragons are little more than dragon toddlers. I think it'd be interesting to see them grow up to be sentient beings, almost like the dragons in Skyrim.

First put aside the theory that Rhaegar and Lyanna are Jon's parents and simply assume he is Ned's bastard. GRRM finished the chapter with ""He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold..."" This makes me think that Jon might be The Great Other that is mentioned by Melisandre. What if the visions she had of skulls around Jon were not only a prediction of his death, but a sign from R'hllor that Jon is meant to be the Other and the skulls were meant to tell her that Jon was a danger to her. There is also the matter of Coldhands. If he is Benjen Stark, and with Bran being connected so deeply with the Old Gods, It might make sense that Jon is the Great Other as it would mean that the starks truly are destined for winter. The crazy implication that this makes is that Aegon (Rhaegars supposed son) may very well being Azor Ahai. If Aegon were to Marry Danaerys and kill her with a Valyrian steal blade through the heart, he could get Lightbringer and that would pit him directly against Jon Snow as the Great Other. The assumption I think is that if Jon is AA then Dany would marry both Jon and Aegon completing the three headed dragon. I think this theory is less likely than the Jon Snow being AA but I think it would be a crazy twist to make Aegon AA and have him kill Dany. It wouldn't be unlike Martin to do something nuts like that.

I do not think this applies to chapters focusing on people without named chapters. The Dornish Prince in Maureen did apparently die in a chapter focused on him. This does not bode well for Ser Kevan Lannister.

211,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2011-12-9,2011,12,9,6,n5b84,self.gameofthrones,Comparing Martin to Salvatore and Eddings (x-post),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/n5b84/comparing_martin_to_salvatore_and_eddings_xpost/,Jackson3125,1323378119,"I tried this over at [/r/asoiaf](/r/asoiaf) and didn't get much, so I though I would try it here:

I originally got into fantasy the same way many others have over the years: Tolkien. The Hobbit was amazing at 12-13 years old, and I proceeded to read the trilogy not long after that. After that, I eventually got into R.A. Salvatore and David Eddings in high school, as well as a few other authors. Specifically, I read all of Salvatore's Forgotten Realms book and the Belgariad series from Eddings.

During college, I took a break from fantasy. I tried to read more of the ""classics"" as well as more philosophy and non-fiction. Some were amazing, some weren't, but I came to realize after several years that for a go-to book, fantasy is still tops for me. I still read other things, but fantasy is definitely a usual source of enjoyment for me.

That being said, I was wondering if any of you guys have read Salvatore or Eddings? **How would you contrast them to G.R.R. Martin? I've actually only read through Storm of Swords so far, so please don't give any spoilers past that.**

Personally, I feel like Martin resembles Eddings more than Salvatore, but that may be because the universes resemble each other more. While Martin and Eddings created universes that consisted mostly of humans with just a tad of ancient and newfound magic sprinkled in, Salvatore's universe in the Forgotten Realms series was one where humans, elves, dark elves, dwarves, dragons, and all other sorts of races all live together and where magic is commonplace.

Salvatore benefitted from the fact that the the universe Drizz't and others resided in had already been conceptualized by Tolkien and other writers who came before him. That Tolkien-esque universe has been perpetuated by Everquest, WoW, the LOTR movies, other Forgotten Realms writers, etc. For the fans of the aformentioned, however, they like this format already, so they appreciate an author who will work inside of it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. They already know the characteristics of each race, magical ability, etc, so they can jump right in to stories and tales.

That's not to say Salvatore didn't creatively conjure up a huge chunk of the set and settings within his novels, not to mention the character development. If anything, his novels are much more accessible than the other two authors' works, and the characters within have made it through so many novels that you become invested in them.

However, I think Eddings and especially Martin are a bit more highbrow than what I've read of Salvatore, and their ability to create new universes is impressive. Their writing overall is more mature, and at the age I am now, I enjoy it more than I would if I was just reading Salvatore for the first time. I have come to really enjoy Martin's ability to make the good look bad and the bad look good, depending on when you judge a character along the tale and to what standard you're judging them. Salvatore began his series with more of a Tolkien-esque good vs. evil approach, but eventually started melding the two with his introduction of characters such as Jarlaxle. Martin, however, was true to the more realistic view of human nature from the start, and I definitely appreciate that. If anything, Eddings might have been more guilty of portraying the least of a moral ""gray"" area for his characters than any of the three, but I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

It's late and I'm rambling now. I could go on for a while about these authors, but I would rather stop and hear Reddits' opinion. What do you think? How do you compare these three authors? Or two if you haven't read one of the three.

**TL; DR**: How would you compare G.R.R.M. to R.A. Salvatore or David Eddings? ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I am now on the 4th book. The third was VERY disappointing to me for numerous reasons. One of these reasons is that the entire thing was basically just conversations and useless facts and flashbacks from the lives of the characters. The most disappointing trend I saw was that something monumental (compared to other events in the 3rd book) would be about to happen, then the author switched narrators abruptly. Nothing more would be said about that occurence until a few chapters later when some random person would get a letter or hear rumors about said monumental event.

Anyways, I was told by my gf's friend to ""stick with it"". I got to book 4 and now they have nothing but characters I hate, plus they didnt bother getting Roy Dotrice. They got some other idiot who thinks everyone talks dramatically at all times like severus snape. I'm on chapter 12 and i've given up. Everyone just stands around thinking and talking. The entire book so far is nothing but the inner monolog of every character I hate, as told by severus snape.

So tell me, r/GoT: Is this book even worth continuing? If I have to listen to these idiots' thoughts any longer I'm afraid i'll snap my ipod in half out of frustration.

I tried making this as spoiler free as possible. please alert me if theres anything I should black out.

- Location-based names. Season One had ""The Kingsroad"" and ""Baelor"" (for the Sept of Baelor). Season Two will have ""Blackwater"". I imagine we could see a few others, maybe ""Fist of the First Men"" for the battle with the Others. ""The Titan"" (of Braavos) could be the episode where Arya arrives in Braavos.
- House words. The pilot was ""Winter is Coming"" (Stark) and the season one finale was ""Fire and Blood"" (Targaryen). I imagine we'll see most or all of them used in later seasons. ""Ours is the Fury"" (Baratheon) will probably appear in Season Two, possibly even the premiere. ""We Do Not Sow"" could be the Greyjoy invasion of the North.
- Common sayings or lines. I would bet money on ""Valar Morghulis"" appearing as an episode name. ""You Know Nothing"" would probably be a late Season Two or early Season Three episode, presumably featuring Jon and Ygritte.",34,19,False,self,,,,,

But in the tv show, there is absolutely no mention of Stannis being involved in the investigation.  Jon Arryn went to visit Gendry, not Jon Arryn *and Stannis*, etc.  Stannis was completely cut out of the equation.  I don't even recall Ned finding it odd that Stannis was absent from the Small Council in the tv series, whereas his absence was constantly felt and wondered about in the book.

So the problem that this brings to light is this: how is the tv show going to explain how Stannis learns of Joffrey/Myrcella/Tommen's true lineage?  We can see from the preview that was released tonight that they are still taking the show in this direction, but I can't really think of a way for them to make this feesable without (a) essentially ret-conning Stannis back into the original investigation by saying ""oh yeah, he was really there all along"" or (b) changing the story such that Ned's letter actually reached Stannis.

Option a is just lazy writing on behalf of HBO, and option b just opens up even more plot holes than the original mess.  Imagine if Stannis actually *did* have Ned's letter on his side in the war; it would have won him, at the very least more credibility, but also quite possibly the allegiance of Robb and the North.

So what do you guys think.  How will they explain Stannis' inexplicable knowledge in the show?",11,8,False,self,,,,,

Born from smoke and salt (emerging from the flames, the salt from her tears), awoke the stone dragons (her petrified eggs), saw the bleeding star (the red comet-tail she sees in the night sky), and when she finally awakens the dragons, it's on her third try, accompanied by the death of her spouse (just like Azor Ahai with his sword and his wife's sacrifice). 

I've also seen a lot of people in this community speculate that it could be Jon Snow. Why do you think so? I agree that he's probably Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark's son, and put the ""ice and fire"" into ASoIaF. But why is he Azor Ahai? 

As for the Red Sword of Heroes, my guess is that it's Oathkeeper, Dawn the Sword of Morning, or even the Red Dragon itself. 

As a sub question, which three people will compose the three headed dragon? Daenerys, Jon Snow, Aegon IV? Can a non-Targaryen become a dragon rider? And who would that be... Stannis? Tyrion? What about Bran? It would be bad ass if he warg'd into a dragon, particularly the green one (as he's a ""green-seer""). Then it would be Daenerys the black (fire), Jon the red (ice and fire), and Bran the green (ice).

Finally, what are your predictions for Aegon IV's future in the plot?

After watching the show countless times, I finally got around to ordering the first 4 books from Amazon (money is tight lately, as with everyone..every dollar counts).

I just finished reading A Game of Thrones and will be starting A Clash of Kings tonight. After watching the trailer that was released, I was glad to learn that not a lot was given away, although some comments have stated subtle hints in the trailer that someone who has yet to read the book wouldn't pick up on (ie: the three horn blows at the end, etc...I still don't know what that means and I'll find and kill anyone that spoils it for me!)

You've all been extra careful with spoilers and what have you regarding the books and I've been able to browse this subreddit for some time now without fear of ruining a major plotline. For people like me who are slow to the party, I just want to say that I appreciate everyone's thoughtfulness.

FYI, I watched the series before I read the books, but I'm still having trouble with the way Glen is portraying Jorah. But who knows? Maybe Glen will wind up owning the role and I'll forget any preconceived notions I had about his character. What do you all think?

I was bored to death of the fights ( im only at page 70 or 80) because of how easy one guy killed everyone else and how wounds and injuries didnt matter unless someone unnamed got killed.

I missed the whores and the camp followers, the cripples and the unneccesary killing of innocent people. I missed the political game of thrones. There is a little bit of politics in that book but compared to GoT its like children playing come into my castle.

Most of the descriptions of the Red Wedding include Grey Wind being killed along with Robb, but I came to this passage in AFFC, Jaime chapter. Walder Rivers is talking to Jaime about Ser Raynald Westerling:

""He [Ser Raynald] was in the yard when our men came to put the direwolf down,"" said Walder Rivers. ""Whalen demanded his sword and he gave it over meek enough, but when the crossbowmen began feathering the wolf he seized Whalen's axe and cut the monster loose of the net they'd thrown over him. Whalen says he took a quarrel in the shoulder and another in the gut, but still managed to reach the wallwalk and throw himself in the river.""

Jaime then asks if they found his corpse, to which they reply they found a thousand, and were unable to tell if any was the direwolf.  From this passage it sounds like Grey Wind may have survived. Other evidence for this is Arya sniffs out Catelyn's corpse by the river, but not Grey Wind's. It's possible some of Robb may live on in his direwolf.

The video was pulled initially, but has now been placed back online, with the closeups of Ygritte removed.  

Here are two (blurry) captures of Ygritte: [photo1](http://media.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/8073/ygritte.jpg) | [photo 2](http://media.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/8073/ygritte2.jpg) ([source](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/rorschachsrants/news/?a=50808))

The video is clearer than those screen caps, and it shows Jon leading Ygritte by a rope with her hands tied together.  I've linked the YouTube to just before the scene.

in my humble opinion, being more than halfway through said book id like to say to ppl who are turned off by negative posts and reviews: ""i like it very much!""

i devised a test with a few questions:
do you want to know what the villian/hero did, experienced or thought while facing an obstacle/hero/villian? do you want to know what lead him/her here? or what changed the general public in their believes and or mindset in their believes towars the hero/villian? 

if you answer one of those questions with ""yes"" then please givethe 4th book at least a try. i am sure you wont be dissapointed. if you are, sue me!!!

EXAMPLES: We found out about all of Robb's successful plans after they'd happened:the only time he sits down and explains exactly what he's going to do is when he outlines his plan to retake the North with the Crannogmen to Catylin. He is almost immediately red-weddinged to death and none of it ever happens.
Khal Drogo and Dany have a complex plan to retake the seven kingdoms involving his unborn son and a prophecy etc but that goes tits up after the first fucking battle. Dany doesn't explain her plan to hatch the dragons or to take Astapor and they go swimmingly.
Ned explains his whole plan to give Stannis the throne, and 2 other plans are outlined by Renly and Littlefinger; neither work and Cersei's mysterious plot goes off perfectly.
Stannis lines out his plan to sacrifice Edric Storm and Davos frees the child. Mance makes his plan to collapse the wall using the Horn of winter clear pretty quickly and that falls apart.
There are only two notable exceptions that occur to me; Dany's plan to take Meereen is relatively clear from the start and its pretty obvious how Sam plans to make Jon Snow Lord Commander.
My issue now is that at the end of AFFC Littlefinger tells us his plan for the first time, that hes going to use Sansa's marriage to the Vale's heir to take winterfell. So now I'm terrified that he's going to go the way of Robb Stark at some point. (please don't spoil any of DWD for me).",21,17,False,self,,,,,

[David Benioff has already stated that aSoS would not be a single season](http://winter-is-coming.net/2011/08/interview-with-benioff-and-weiss-about-season-two-and-beyond/) which I am pumped about, because not only is it the longest book of the series so far, it's one of my all time favorite books so getting a more detailed representation of it is always a plus to me. But that also means you have to end Season 3 somewhere in the middle of the book. If I remember correctly the Red Wedding happens around page 730 of 1150 or so, so if you did a perfect 50/50 cut that would place it toward the beginning of Season 4, which not only seems odd to me, but I'm having a hard time thinking of a better place to end Season 3 than the Red Wedding. However, ending it at the Red Wedding would mean either a longer Season 3 than 4 or a very detailed Season 4, neither of which are bad, just peculiar I guess.

Also, since aFfC and aDWD occur in a similar time frame I was thinking about how Seasons 5 and 6 will go. I think it would be odd to do a aFfC season and then have Season 6 come around and say, ""oh ya by the way all this shit was happening while the last season was going on,"" but once again we come to the problem that if you combine the two books, where the heck do you split them?

Obviously Season 2 hasn't even started yet, so even the producers probably don't have a concrete idea of how its going to be structured, but this was bugging me so I'd figure I'd ask reddit for your thoughts.",16,7,False,self,,,,,

Hello, I'm the lead mod for /r/gameofthrones. In just the first few hours of your account you've managed to generate a half dozen reports to the mods for bad posts. In reviewing your posts there have indeed been multiple problems with what you're posting. You repeatedly violate the subreddit policies at a scale that's historically only been seen with Trolls. Normally that would result in a ban from the subreddit, but your account seems legit enough that I feel you should get a clear warning before such extreme action. So this is your one warning.
I've gone ahead and removed all your posts in /r/gameofthrones to give you a clean start. I encourage you to read at least the posting and spoiler policies linked from the right sidebar. Knowing what's ok to post is important. Please be more thoughtful in your future posts, and try to follow the policies as well as you can. If you have any questions about this you can message me or send a message to the general subreddit moderators using the link in the subreddit's right sidebar.

Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with does eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras Tyrells sister Margaery, hed confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. No, Ned had told him, bemused.""

He writes beautiful prose. His characters are (mostly) rich and engaging. They feel human. You can really picture yourself in this world. But the man doesn't know how to write an actual plot to save his life. 

The closest thing we ever had to a plot was in the first book, with Ned searching for the killers of his mentor. But even that kinda fell apart, was forgotten for a while and then (minor spoilers)...


 ...explained away with almost no meaningful purpose in the latest book.  Now that he's on the back-end of a seven book series and instead of tying up loose ends and bringing the over-arching plot together somehow, he's actually multiplying plot threads. More characters are being added. New intrigues are cropping up. 

More Spoilers Below

[Book Spoilers] (/b ""I think Tyrion's story in ADWD is a perfect example of this. Literally nothing of consequence happened. He was going someplace, got waylaid, got captured, was going someplace else, got captured, escaped, etc. But the Tyrion's chapters in the book did almost nothing to advance the plot. They merely served as some background flavor that could have been explained away in a couple sentences in one of Dany's chapters. GRRM literally just spun his wheels for an entire book."" )

I want to keep reading because I'm invested in the characters, but when it comes to the plot these books are like bad sex with a beautiful woman. The build up is so awesome but then after I'm thinking ""did I really enjoy that or did I just really want to enjoy that?"" Ugh. 

Really hoping that GRRM tightens up the final two books and starts to focus in on a coherent plot. If you are reading this somehow, please give us more than just events and characters. Tie them all together in a meaningful way. Give each book a purpose and then write towards it. Time to start wrapping things up and narrowing plot lines.  ",16,0,False,self,,,,,

*What Daenerys is going to do with her new dragons

*The confrontation between Tyrion and Joffery and Cercei when Tyrion goes to King's Landing to take over as king as the wish of his father Tywin

*What happens with Jon and the rest of the Knight's Watch when they go looking for Benjen Stark 

*To find out about Stannis Baratheon and why Tywin feared him more than...(i can't remember what he said)

*Why Renly was proclaimed King(?) instead of his older brother Stannis and why he ditched Eddard

*What happens to Robb and his followers as they now want/follow him as king?

*What happens to the hostages of both sides, Jamie and Sansa

*I don't actually understand what Arya is meant/going to do

617,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2011-12-26,2011,12,26,12,nqsmk,self.gameofthrones,I just finished reading book 3. Here's my thoughts. (lots of spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/nqsmk/i_just_finished_reading_book_3_heres_my_thoughts/,sef239,1324871248,"The entire book, but the last half especially, was the most gripping writing I've read. There were times when I felt like I was inside the book, witnessing these things. My favorite things about the series so far is GRRM's talent for flow, dialogue and descriptions. I never felt bored reading the book. (This happened in book 2, but I thought the Blackwater battle was the most epic battle description I've ever read).

Specifically, here's my favorite SoS moments and why:

[book spoiler] (/b ""The trial by battle for Tryion. Reading how Gregor killed the Red Viper was brutally shocking. I had to read that part several times. Repeating Gregor's crimes while nearly killing him only made the Red Vipers death even sadder."")

[book spoiler] (/b ""The conversation between Melisandre and Davos before Davos was released from prison. Her character gets to say some of the most insightful things of any of the characters. I am LOVING Melisandre's character so far, even though I am not sure of her true motives. Would love to see how she develops later on in the series."")

[book spoiler] (/b ""The red wedding. Unfortunately, I got spoiled about Joffrey's death so that was not a surprise. But I had no idea Lord Frey was going to be such an asshole, and Robb was starting to become one of my favorite characters. Oh well. Catelyn's death was shocking too (I thought her ""sawing"" the fool's neck before dying was truly badass though, and I haven't read the prologue yet but I hear she actually lives."")

[book spoiler] (/b ""Tyrion killing Shae and then Tywin. Did not see that coming at all. Does this mean Shae was fucking Tywin? That puts an interesting spin on things although its left kind of vague. I really hope Jamie finds out Tyrion lied about killing Joffrey as their relationship is very interesting. Although Jaimie apparently doesn't and never has truly cared about Joffrey, and said he even deserved to die. I just hope they still have that brotherly love."")

[book spoiler] (/b ""Arya's overall story. I thought the Hound's death was anticlimactic, I was starting to like him as well. Glad she got to kill the tickler."")

[book spoiler] (/b ""And the very last few pages. Not much to say there, except ""WOW!"" Littlefinger is actually more of a schemer than I ever thought, can't wait to see what happens with him."")

I am disappointed so many interesting characters died, but luckily there are still many that are alive. I am most interested in hearing how Cersei will deal with her family's deaths, Littlefinger's story with Sansa, Dany's conquest for the throne, and most of all Stannis's conquest. I like Bran but  nothing really happens in his chapters.",15,13,False,self,,,,,

About halfway through the book I started wondering had I skipped a few chapters by accident or something because timelines had jumped forward very quickly in fact large portion of the middle of the book just plain did not make sense. Anyway I persevered and around the time of the first Cersei chapter it all got normal again. Then i was thinking jesus its caught up with affc very quickly! I honestly thought grrm had lost it the book was terrible like.

Today i finished the book and it was a great ending i had forgotten about the trouble i had halfway through and was excited to see what the internet thought of it so i googled finished adwd and started checking out fan forums. What followed was a barrage of spoilers of entire sections of the book.that were not in my ebook.version! 

I am heartbroken reddit :( should i read the whole book again right now or wait a while?

Tl;dr: my version of adwd was missing about 40% of the chapters i found this out after finishing. 

Sorry for typos i am on my phone.

So now Im thinking about reading. Last time I've red a book was Harry Potter... All of them.

Here's my questons:
Should I buy the book? I don't like buying book... I feel like wasting because I never re-read them... So am I better off to buy a tablet or something? I haven't check the price between e-book vs physical book either so I dont know...

Remember [these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/liquidsouldesign/6033243060/in/set-72157627410677518) sweet looking House Sigil posters?

They were posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/nlits/24x36_game_of_thrones_poster_for_ya/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/lva44/stark_houses_poster_wallpaper/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ju3so/westerosi_kingdoms_poster_wallpaper/) (and a few other times Im sure). Well, I ended up tracking down the artist who made them. I wanted to offer some positive suggestions based on the comments made in this subreddit (and in r/ASOIAF)* so that theyd be better aligned with the books (e.g. color of the backgrounds, usage of a shield for the nights watch in lieu of a bird). Anyways, Tom (aka Liquidsouldes) wrote back and asked me to not print them myself. He said hes gotten a few takedown notices from HBO and would appreciate it if I could order my prints though the site he uses (at least the ones that havent been taken down yet). As a  former artist myself I told him I would be happy to do so.

Since hes very new to [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/liquidsouldesign), I offered to spread his request to the community.

If youd like to order prints from Tom, [here](http://www.redbubble.com/people/liquidsouldes/collections/115042-game-of-thrones-posters) is a link to his site.

To be clear, Ive never spoken with Tom until today. I have not, and will not, receive any compensation for anyone who prints his stuff. Tom will, and Im sure hell appreciate it.

TL;DR  The artist who made those cool posters is asking (nicely) that people order prints from him, rather than print them on their own.

First some general thoughts on it:
1. Quentyn Martell is as useless as nipples on a breastplate. Not only that, but I was sorely disappointed with the lack of character given to him. What was the point?
2. Either GRRM has made his foreshadowing more blatantly obvious, or I'm much better at picking up on it now. I'm going to go with a combination. Nothing in this book surprised me. Not even what happened to Jon.
3. On that note. I don't much like Jon any more, either. He regularly and voraciously ignores prudent council from EVERYONE around him.
4. Where the hell is Littlefinger?

Now, on to my tinhat.

The three heads of the dragon: I've seen the going theories, largely that it will be Jon (assuming R/L), obviously Dany, and quite probably Aegon.

However, seeing how GRRM has set up Dany's suitors, and since Aegon is all ready in Westeros, I propose a radical idea: the three heads of the dragon are not people. They are elements, or close enough as to make no matter: Fire, Ice, and Iron. Each of these relates to a person, and that person may lead, but the elements are the heads. Dany represents fire. Jon represents Ice (this may, of course be entirely wrong. But I don't believe Jon is dead. As a potential alternative: Coldhands). Victarion represents Iron.

Here the heads break down further. Dany will lead the dragon riders (By air), Jon will ...have some part of the armies (by land) and Victarion will lead the dragon's fleet (by sea).

GRRM has made it clear that 'words are wind' and so the prophecies mean little and less in the grand scheme. The events that occur are politically or militarily driven, usually with very little influence from prophecy, excepting that characters who believe in the prophecies act upon them.

Pick it apart as you will.

(Spoilers and speculation thread!),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/nxaxc/bran_stark_possibly_based_off_of_a_welsh/,Oddessy,1325315992,"I don't know if this has been brought up before, but I was randomly looking into mythological figures to name a new electronic thing that I got for Christmas. Anyway, that's not important, what's important is I found an article about [Bran the Blessed] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran_the_Blessed) on Wikipedia and I started reading it, and then I realized that there were way too many similarities between Bran the Blessed of Welsh Mythology and Bran Stark. I could honestly be reading into it too much, but I'll give you a few points and let you decide. 

* Bran the Blessed in Welsh is Bendigeidfran, literally ""Blessed Raven""

* Skipping some speculation that's probably a bit of a stretch regarding Melisandre, one of Bran the Blessed's major roles is destroying a cauldron that can bring people back to life. He sacrifices himself in the process, but asks that his head be returned to Britain. Bran Stark doesn't sacrifice himself, yet, but he is technically just an upper body (not quite head), having been paralyzed. **Edit: As it was pointed out to me by Marowak, it is Efnysien, Bendigeidfran's half-brother, who sacrifices himself to destroy the cauldron. Not Bran. Whoops! Thanks for the correction!**

* The survivors of the battle where Bran the Blessed was mortally wounded (and reduced to a head) travel with him to an island where they live for 80 years without perceiving the passage of time. It seemed awfully similar to Jojen and Meera surviving Winterfell's fall and traveling to the North and joining the Children of the Forest.

* Eventually the survivors receive word of the terrible things that have happened in the outside world. ""As instructed they take the now silent head to the Gwynfryn, the ""White Hill"" (thought to be the location where the Tower of London now stands), where they bury it facing France so as to ward off invasion."" I don't want to stretch too far, but the White Hill in Game of Thrones could very much be related to Winterfell and the weirwood trees, or even the Isle of Faces in the center of Gods Eye. We have seen that he is learning how to see through the weirwood's eyes, and it might be that he plays a huge role in helping Westeros deal with an outside threat.

What do you think? Am I drawing too many thin lines of connection here?

(Potential Spoilers, all books.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/nxer1/religion_in_asoiaf_potential_spoilers_all_books/,TomTheNurse,1325326832,"I tip my hat to GRR for creating and explaining in depth essentially 4 separate and unique religions for his tale, (The Seven, The Trees, The Burning God and the Drowned God), as well as many others he at least touched upon.  When I read the series the first time, it bothered me a bit about how much effort and book time he put into them.  (I wanted to read about dragons, fucking and killing!) 

Upon re reading, I almost got a sense that GRR is trying to convey a subtle, cynical message.  When his characters are respectfully reverent to their beliefs and not shoving their beliefs down other peoples throats, while he is respectful to those characters, he gives them very little relief from their trials in the form of some divine intervention as a result of those beliefs.  (As I write this, I am reminded of the quote often attributed to Napoleon where, God is on the side that has the most artillery.)   GRR also seems to paint many of the heads and leadership of his religions as borderline crazy, manipulative, and far more interested in power, accumulating wealth and control than in saving souls.  

I cant help but wonder if this is GRRs way of reflecting what he sees in our current society and his way of making that observation.  

Any thoughts on this?

Jon Snow will be revealed as not the bastard son on Eddard Stark, rather he will be the true born son of the Mad King whose identity was changed to protect him.  Dany will either marry Jon or more likely, she will die.  (Remember, GRR is the author!) Jon Snow will sit on the iron throne as its rightful king with his dragons at his feet.
