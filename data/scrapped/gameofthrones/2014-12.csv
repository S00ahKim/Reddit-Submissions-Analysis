I know a lot of people out there take the 'the books are so much better side' and im wondering if it would be a more fulfilling experience if i did that rather than watch the series. **I want to know what you think**


- Is it too late to start reading?

- Are the books better than the TV series?

- For those who have read the books and seen the TV series, which did u prefer and why?

I have never been as mesmerized with a show as I have GoT. I have T-shirts, fleece, mugs, pint glasses, calendars, watch parties, rewatch the entire series before the new season every year, the list goes on. GoT is by far the highlight of my media consumption every year. The fact that you never know what to expect is the biggest appeal to me and as painful as it can be the experiences of The Red Wedding, Ned Stark's death, The Red Viper's fate are what I look forward to every year. I'm also a huge stickler for spoilers and don't watch previews for the show (or movies in general).

A few months ago some twat on reddit spoiled the ending of the last book. I've tried to get over it, but months later and I am still incredibly frustrated by it. They basically said that Jon Snow get stabbed by his Nights Watch brothers while talking to some king (possibly Stannis, but I kinda forgot that part and would rather that not be confirmed). I know people say it's just one small part of a huge story, but that's hard for me to come to terms with. Because I imagine what it would be like watching all of Season 1 knowing Ned was going to die, or all of Season 4 knowing Oberyn will get none of the vindication every episode built on further and further. It would've ruined a very large part of the enjoyment of each of those seasons for me. I can only imagine the build up that is going to go into Jon Snow's character in whatever Season this takes place, the story/stakes that are going to surround whatever meeting he took with whatever king, and how all of that is going to be ruined for me because I already know his fate. Not to mention 70% of that merch I talked about earlier is House Stark.

So, what can I do? I've had things spoiled before, but never for a show I take this seriously. I would've started rewatching the show by now, but all I think about when I go to rewatch it is that spoiler. I know I'm probably obsessing over it beyond what is reasonable, but I can't help it.. And I'm hoping some of you have advice for how to deal with it.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I already considered reading the books, but I am going to stick with my cycle of watch ---&gt; read. I'm a huge film/TV buff and I much prefer watching the events unfold on the big screen and then reliving them on the page.

EDIT 2: Thank you all SO MUCH for your replies. They definitely gave me the consolation/reassurance I needed. Now in the interest of avoiding any inadvertent spoilers I'm going to go ahead and delete this submission. But once again, thank you all so much.

So, to clarify, this is not a list of moments I think GOT SHOULD have in season 5; rather, these are 10 BIG moments I feel (whether because of actual evidence or what we know about the elements they like to play up) are most likely to be adapted into season 5.  NOTE: I'm mainly listing big scenes, which are either very important based on their events or the character development within them. 

OF COURSE, AS THE TITLE SUGGESTS, THIS LIST IS STRAIGHT FROM THE PORTION OF THE BOOKS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADAPTED YET.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.  TONS OF THEM.  BIG ONES.  SPOILERS ABOUT WHAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.  REFERENCES TO SPOILERS THAT HAVE.  DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS YOU HAVE EITHER READ ALL OF THE BOOKS OR TRULY HAVE TRANSCENDED GIVING A SHIT.
SO SPOILERS.  ONE LAST TIME.

And without further ado, the 10 moments I'm fairly certain will occur in season 5 (In no particular order).  Feel free to give your opinion as well below.

10: MANCE RAYDER'S ""BURNING"".
Description:  Melisandre has a man she claims is Mance Rayder burned alive to honor the God R'hollor; she does this before the entire Night's Watch and the Wildling's at Castle Black.
Why it's in:  I believe that in the height of all the death that has happened recently, they would like to keep a dramatic ""fake out"" like this into the story.  Plus, along with the election and some other tidbits, it's some excitement to add to the wall (needless to say there will not be as much focus on rations and such in the show).

9: EDD, FETCH ME A BLOCK
Description:  When Janos Slynt relentlessly shows disrespect and insubordination to Jon Snow, the young Lord Commander has him beheaded in front of the Night's Watch and Stannis Baratheon.
Why it's in:  Like #10, this true-to-the-book scene adds a lot of excitement to the wall early in the season.  Also, it's a very big ""badass"" moment for Jon, similar (though less extreme perhaps) to Dany's firey moment when she got her unsullied.  They will not exclude this scene by any means.  They made a point to show that Janos Slynt is now at the wall after two seasons, I'm sure this is for a reason.

8: THEON'S CONFESSION IN THE GODSWOOD
Description: Theon Greyjoy, currently prisoner of Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell, has a moment in front of the Weirwood in which he pours his heart out about all he's done.
Why it's in:  Not only is it a great moment for Theon, in which they can showcase the awesome job that Alfie Allan is doing with the performance, but the actor himself has specifically mentioned it is a scene he is excited for.  Though he is not exactly in charge of what stays and what goes, this does give me the impression we will see this happen.

7: ARYA'S ARRIVAL AT THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
Description:  Once in Braavos, Arya seeks out the location of the Faceless Men and proves herself, beginning her training.
Why it's in:  This is the hardest one to include, because I have a feeling that this will be altered a good bit.  None the less, I feel it's pretty safe to say Arya will come upon the House of Black and White (the doors are shown in the brief teaser for season 5), and will in SOME way prove herself to someone.  The test and the one giving it may be different from the book (although I hope at least the ""kiss"" is kept), but we will get this moment.

6: ARYA THROWS BURIES NEEDLE
Description:  As part of her training, Arya is told to throw away all of her possessions.  She does this, but is unable to throw away Needle and buries it in a safe place, where it can be later retrieved.
Why it's in:  This is a big moment for Arya, and begins the Arya Stark/nobody contrast that is a huge part of her character.  With the amount of focus I think she will get (season 4 ending on her scene, the first teaser being about her) I think it's likely we'll see this left out.

5: CERSEI'S WALK OF SHAME
Description:  After being arrested by the Faith, Cersei is stripped down and made to parade through King's Landing while the people throw things at her and further humiliate her.
Why it's in:  I could say a lot about how big of a moment this is for her character, but any time spent with google can tell you that this scene has been shot.

4: TYRION ARRIVES IN ESSOS
Description:  After fleeing King's Landing, Tyrion discovers he is being taken to Essos to form an alliance with the Targaryens.
Why it's in:  Like #7, this is a vague one to include.  The circumstances and even the Targaryen's in question may be changed entirely, but from set photos and common sense we DO know that Tyrion will get to Essos (and perhaps further than his book story goes, if you know which set photo I'm talking about), so I felt it is worth including.  It is, after all, a game changer for Tyrion.

3 DAZKNAK'S PIT
Description: When the fighting pits are opened, most of Meereen comes to attend the ""grand opening"".  When an attempt on Daenery's life fails, chaos erupts:  Drogon appears, and Dany rides him off and away from Meereen.
Why it's in: Many believe that Cersei's trial will be in the penultimate episode, but that hardly seems to merit a full episode the way a battle would.  I think it's very likely that this moment (definitely too big for Daenerys to cut) will be a huge part of the 9th episode (which is known for big events).  Plus certain set pics indicate that there are definitely fighting pit scenes.

2:  THE DOTHRAKI FIND DAENERYS:
Description:  After wandering the desert in a delirious state,  Daenerys is found feeding on a horse with Drogon by Khal Jhaqo and his men.
Why it's in:  Not only a big moment for Daenerys, but a great cliffhanger to leave off with at the end of the season, when the finale inevitably checks in on her after the big episode 9 scene.

1: JON SNOW'S STABBING
Description:  After declaring that he will go aid Stannis in taking back Winterfell, the Night's Watch erupts into chaos.  Jon Snow is stabbed by his own men.
Why it's in:  Does anyone really even doubt this will be included?  They love killing off their characters, and even though he may not be dead I find it bordering on impossible that they won't leave the season off with that up in the air.  Plus it is LAST episode (or at least second to last) kind of scene, certainly not meant for an early episode of season 6.  Plus you know they are dying to see people's reactions.

So, plenty of stuff to look forward to even with all that is cut from the show (likely Stoneheart, Kingsmoot, Aegon, ect.).  Let's hope they can do it justice.  What do you guys think?",33,14,False,self,,,,,

I thought back to the Red Wedding and how Catelyn died thinking her entire family was either dead or held hostage by Lannisters, and how she lost her mind in her final moments. Throughout the rest of the book stories are told about how she was stripped and dumped in the river, not to mention the fact that Arya/Nymeria actually found her body in the state that it was in.

So now we have this woman who has lost *literally* everything back in the world and I can only imagine she wants nothing more than to take vengeance on those who took her family from her, making ""The North Remembers"" line I always hear that much clearer.

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say right now other than that the whole idea of her existence, from her mind to the ravaged state of her body, genuinely scares me. The fact that she can't speak makes it so much worse. All I know for certain is that Catelyn Stark is going to haunt my dreams tonight.",20,25,False,self,,,,,

I come from the far far land of the walking dead and I absolutely loved their two seasons that telltale games made. The first game was my first introduction to the interaction genre and I have since then been following Telltale games updates and played all their latest games. When this game came out i bought it in an instant. I don't know how far in to the episode I am but the three different and parallell stories are kind of cool.

Now to the question. I've tried to watch the series but I gave up at half of season one because it felt like every person was related to each other or they were enemies. and so many characters were introduced I couldn't keep up with all of them so I got lost. I would watch it if this didn't happen but can someone maybe try to give me some advice to keep up with all families and stuff?",10,1,False,self,,,,,

So aliens will attack, and there'll be an epic battle between aliens, knights, and white walkers. And all the men will die. Except for Jon Snow! Because these aren't just any aliens, they're Martian MANhunters! Get it?

Now Daenerys will rule this kingdom full of only women. And turns out she's miraculously pregnant. She renames the kingdom to ""The Amazon"" and who does she give birth to? Motherfucking Gal Gadot! That's right bitches, Wonder Woman!!!!

And remember when Tyrion scoffed at the Wall and said ""and fishermen in lannisport say they've seen mermaids."" Turns out they weren't lying! That's Jon Snow's real mother, a motherfucking mermaid and he survives by going under water to a magical kingdom in The Narrow Sea! Because he's Aquaman! Khal Drogo was a mislead! He's actually Jon Snow's brother, Orm! The whole Game of Thrones series is a prequel to the Justice League! And BOOM!

But wait; bonus round, one of the aliens was bitten by a white walker and then in his deliriousness he crashed into Roswell and his mutated white walker disease slowly spread across the world for years and years until it goes viral and starts The Walking Dead universe, because it was a two-fer!

But would people like him as much if Joffrey and Cersei weren't such villainous characters.

He wants to usurp Joffrey because he isn't the true king, but there is a reason the institution of a monarchy actually running a nation is archaic. Would Ned still be held in such high regards if Gendry's character was the wrongful king and that little shit Joffrey was the rightful heir he was trying to put in power?",35,24,False,self,,,,,

What order should I read in? I'm assuming it would be best to go: ASOIAF (up to ADWD), Dunk and Egg series, and then AWOIAF. However, if I could read AWOIAF as soon as possible that would be great.

Side note: would it be safe to play the new TellTale game that has come out or should I finish the main series first?

Largely Disappointing,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2oc39d/no_spoilersgot_game_game_of_thrones_iron_from_ice/,AgentZombieMan,1417754924,"So, I just finished Episode 1 of the Game of Thrones game from Telltale, and it was quite disappointing.

 In terms of performance, it was very poor. The audio was shotty; skipped often, came out of sync constantly, and sometimes it just stopped playing for full sentences. The characters movement wasn't great either, constantly jumping about and disappearing.

 As for the characters, they BLUNT FORCED the Foresters into the story, like Bioshock 2 level ""Oh, they were there! You just never noticed them"" bullshit. And I didn't particularly care for any of the characters you play as. Also, the characters from the show looked KINDA like shit. Margery looked like she was in her mid-30's, Tyrion's forehead was 3X larger than it should be, and Cersia's face seemed small. Lady Forester looked Bullshit level similar to Lady Catelyn.

 As for the writing and story, not even Mr. Dinklage could save it. The writing had 0 finesse, just a blatant commentary of what's going on, few of the actors gave a convincing performance. Even Dinklage wasn't great, his lines, like everyone else's, were very flat and blunt. I didn't care for any of the new characters, they were all either assholes or just unlikable. 

 In the end, I was very disappointed with the Game, the story, really everything. And, that's my opinion on this, I doubt I will be getting the next episode. I have no good things to say about it.

P.S. Their re-creation of the intro looked like DOG SHIT!",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I've already done two mouse events, dodging left and right, and I hit the person in the face with the Forrester shield. I'm stuck after that, where Gared is running to stop the crossbowman from shooting some of the Forresters (I think), where you have to slide the mouse up. I've tried this event thirty times, and even started a new save just in case there was a bug or something. Every time, Gared's shield raises, but not enough for the event to register. I watched someone's playthrough of Episode 1, to that point, and they did it with no issue. In mine, Gared keeps getting shot right before the arrow is suppose to turn yellow.
 
I've tried everything I can think of. I closed the game and let my computer cool down, I've restarted, I put new batteries in my mouse, I've tried fast and slow, I've mouse the mouse as far as my arm will let me, and I've tried doing it on a different surface. I've died this way at least thirty times. Has anyone else had this problem? I didn't encounter anything like this when I played The Wolf Among Us. Am I just being dumb?

I know the books are ahead of the show in most storylines, but it's my understanding that the 2 are similar and the 4th and 5th books continue the intrigue set by their predecessors, while 2 more books remain unpublished.

Leading up to the start of the series, Westeros was in turmoil (Robert's Rebellion, Aerys ""The Mad King"", Jaime ""The Kingslayer"", and Jon Arryn's death among the contributing factors). To start the show off, Ned was tapped to become Hand of the King, and the dominoes started falling as events were set in motion.

Since then, there have been all kinds of characters vying for position, whether it be a high status or revenge. Stannis is the rightful king, but the throne belongs to Daenerys because Robert usurped it. Neither of them are even on the throne. A young bastard that was the product of twincest currently sits on it. Dragons are coming west. White Walkers are coming south. As King's Landing is the destination for most, the Stark children are some of the only characters venturing away. Varys and Littlefinger are pulling strings.  What about Tyrion, Jaime, Cersei, Brienne, etc.?

While there are certainly some major events ahead of us, I don't think it's all leading up to an ultimate climax where there is a ""winner"". There will never be peace in Westeros (or anywhere else) for our beloved characters.

When you take a step back, Ned wasn't the first domino for the series. He was just one of the dominoes. He's the first domino that we saw on screen, but the story tells us that others preceeded him.

We've been conditioned by books, movies, television, etc. to believe any character we follow closely must be starting a Hero's journey (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth). ""A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes home"".  That's the beauty of Game of Thrones (and ASOIAF). It takes our expectations and throws them out the window, but we love it.",4,4,False,self,,,,,

But **I will be avoiding *any* book *discussion*,** just in case there are people planning on reading the books *after* having watched 4 seasons.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Anyway, I'm re-watching the first season, and Jorah Mormont, who is guarding and counseling Daenerys at this point, receives the royal pardon from King Robert Barratheon, who wrote it obviously before he died.  The pardon, of course, was for spying on Daeny and reporting back to King's Landing.  

But then, I remember this recent season where Mormont's Pardon was intentionally delivered to Barristan.  I thought that it might be a simple letter telling Barristan that Mormont was pardoned, but the way it was described, it sounded like the document wasn't a letter to Barristan to inform him of anything, but an *actual* Royal Pardon that Mormont presumably was meant to receive, since, as Daenerys puts it, King Robert Barratheon drafted the Pardon the year that they met (so it couldn't be a newly-drafted pardon).  Daenerys even says ""take this pardon..."" -- confirming that the document is a real pardon.

So, I don't understand.  Jorah clearly received his pardon in Season 1 but obviously chose to stay with Daenerys.  Again, this pardon was drafted by King Rob Barratheon.  

But then, in Season 4, Barristan *intercepts* the pardon.  Jorah has the chance to read it, and basically Barristan, Daenerys, AND even Jorah recognize it as an authentic Royal Pardon from King Robert from about 1.5-2 years prior.  The only distant possibility is forgery, but Jorah said it was authentic, like he had never seen it before.  

Since Jorah has the actual Pardon from season 1, he has actual plausible deniability that the 2nd pardon is authentic.  But he doesn't contest it.... meaning a) it's a genuine, authentic, irrefutable pardon, even though Jorah already received it/one b) it's forged but everyone assumes it's authentic, c) it's forged but Jorah is the only one who knows it's forged, and chooses to confess despite having the actual knowledge that *that* cannot be the actual pardon (since he received the actual pardon in S1), or d) the showmakers just erased the fact that he received the pardon already.

How can this be reconciled?  To me, it seems like the showrunners may be trying to pull a fast one and hope that people forgot that Jorah already got pardoned in Season 1 so that there would be a reason for Jorah to be exiled in Season 4.  Otherwise, how could there be TWO authentic King Robert royal pardons from the year that the show started?

I know that the Season 4 seal had the Hand seal, which signifies that the Hand sent it.  And it would make sense that Tywin would send it -- but *how* would he have access to a genuine Rob Barratheon Pardon?  Also, it could very well be interpreted as Ned Stark's action of drafting the pardon, since he was the Hand in season 1 when Jorah received his Pardon.

Again, all I'll say is that in the books, there's no weird redundancy or possibility of a plot hole like this.

**TL;DR -- In Season 1, Jorah receives a royal pardon from King Robert Barratheon.  Then, in Season 4, about 2 years later, Barristan ""intercepts"" *another* royal pardon from King Robert Barratheon.  Both documents are authentic, but how and why are there TWO authentic pardons in the first place?  Even if Tywin intentionally sent it to Barristan, he would still need the authentic document to send...which was already sent by Ned Stark in Season 1, and it's not like Robby Barratheon was around to draft another in late Season 4.**

EDIT: I understand that in Season 1, it's Varys who sends the Pardon.  But this still leaves the issue of there being two Pardons, since Varys cannot have the power to actually execute and sign a *Royal* Pardon.   Basically, regardless of the seal, Jorah now has received TWO Royal Pardons signed by R. Barratheon.

I hadn't really considered getting it, but I saw it on my Xbox homepage and saw that it was only $5. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I was considering buying it. I decided to check it out on Steam first because I thought I might like it more on PC and saw that it was $30 on there. I knew this game was going to be in 6 parts, so I figured that with the Steam version you were paying for all 6 parts up front. But, then I read the description and it kind of confused me.

&gt; Game of Thrones: Season One is a six part episodic game series set in the world of HBO's groundbreaking TV show. This new story tells of House Forrester, a noble family from the north of Westeros, loyal to the Starks of Winterfell.

The description just calls it Season 1. Nothing is mentioned about whether or not this purchase includes the other 5 seasons. Also, am I correct in assuming that a season means the same thing as an episode?

I saved Bowen, happy that I chose to save him because I see him run off with that other guy, and we know that if you don't *see* somebody die, they will probably come back later.

**Ask Maergery for help/Don't ask her:**

I asked her for help, but only after I spoke with the queen.

**Swear Fealty to the King/Swear Fealty to Maergery:**

To the King. Always to the king. It was what Maergery wanted me to do, even when I had to choose one or the other.

**Show mercy on the thief/send him to the wall/cut off his fingers:**

Chopped them bitches off. I want the support of the soldiers first, then the people. I could be going to a war soon.

**Choose Your Sentinel, Roylston/Duncan:**

I chose Rolyston. I appreciate Duncan's levelheadedness, but I could use Roylston as a powerful piece on the chessboard, and if this head soldier felt unappreciated, he might turn against me. Duncan is a bit of a bitch, I feel, so I can control him more.

**Send Malcolm to Essos/Don't Send Him:**

I sent Malcolm to Essos. He is important to the long-game, as I'd need a champion to defend my house potentially if I can just get past Ramsay Snow.

**Meet Ramsay at the gate/invite into the hall. Diplomacy/Bargain/Threaten:**

I met him in the grand hall and bargained with him. I figured that if I were to swear fealty to the Boltons, and offer our house as a better replacement to the Whitehills, they might be merciful and let us be under their banner.

**Try to take my sister/Give myself up/Say nothing:**

I gave myself up, and ultimately got a knife in my neck for being bold.

Oh well.

""Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world, but not anymore. The dragons are gone, the giants are dead, and the children of the forest are forgotten""

Just thought it was a nice use of foreshadowing, as the each of them are present by season 4. Not too sure about the children of the forest, but certainly 3 of the 4 are being used to take the iron throne. 

Stannis and Melisandre are using magic

Dany has dragons

The widlings used giants to try to get past the wall

Obviously it worked to his advantage when he used Theon to take back Moat Cailin and for the ""Ayra Stark"" wedding but Theon's conditioning took place before any of these plans were made. 

Why do you think rather than have his ""fun"" torturing Theon but keeping him whole and of sane mind before handing him over to his father that Ramsey instead conditioned Theon as a filthy, broken servant when a man in his position and with his capabilities would be capable of doing this to just about anyone else at a lesser cost.

As some of you already noticed, it was added earlier today, but I was unable to properly test the changes due to Reddit's servers giving me sorry-down-try-again pages.  In checking earlier this evening Reddit was fine, but my host running the flair bot was slow.  I have finally tested it fully (for example, you can see Forrester on my account right now).  If you make a change and don't see your flair after 10 minutes, you might want to try selecting it again.  The laggy server combination means sometimes the bot doesn't get the flair post done properly.  

So technical issues aside, House Forrester is not the only new flair option.  These often-requested people have been added too:

* Lyanna Stark
* Ygritte
* Jon Connington
* Olenna Tyrell
* Thoros of Myr
* Eddison Tollett
* Grenn
* Robert Baratheon

All of them have alternate Words, just as House Forrester has ""Iron From Ice.""  If you want to browse or select the Words options, be sure to mark the checkbox at the top of [the flair selection page](http://reddit.kevinhatch.com/).  I hope to have the next flair update done after the holidays. 

Cheers

I just bought the Telltale video game, solely based on the fact that its based on Game of Thrones. When I first started playing it, I was disappointed that the game was a Game of Thrones themed Dragon's Lair remake. I thought to myself that if the story was as good as the source material, I would enjoy playing even if it completely lack any kind of gameplay. 

After 2 hours of playing it, I realized I was incredibly bored by the story, but it was also the case when i first started watching the TV show. Does the game have a very slow start and then pick up? It feel like the event that are happening are terribly irrelevant in the grand scheme of thing.

Who wrote it? Was it some guy at Telltale? Was GRRM supervising the whole thing? how does the story compare in term of quality to the story of the book or the TV show

Also, If I play the game, will I spoil myself? I watched all the TV show and read the first 2 books.

I was also wondering if my choice really make a difference story wise, or is it just some dialogue that are different depending on how you act? I see the annotation telling me I made choice. I have yet to notice a difference. Some people tell me they like/dont like me. The game notify me if I keep a promise, but I dont see what is different.

For those who finished the game already, did you like it or wish you would never have bought it?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

So everything I know is based off of the show, and I was hoping someone who has read the books could give me some insight.

In the show, it seemed like Arya aort of blackmails Jaqen. He said give me three names and she threatened to name him if he didn't help her escape and forced him to kill more people than he wanted. I would imagine Jaqen would be sort of angry with Arya after that point and be done with her. Yet he gives her the coin and tells her to give it to anyone in Braavos, helping her again. Why would he continue to help her after what she did? Is there maybe some context from the book that's missing here?

The Knights Templar,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2p6cv8/all_spoilers_the_knights_watch_v_the_knights/,[deleted],1418483781,Earlier I read a thread discussing historical and geographic similarities between Westerns and North America. Personally I believe that it is more similar to Europe and North Africa however; it got me thinking about other historic representations within GOT. Its kind of a stretch but what are your thoughts about The Nights Watch portraying The Knights Templar? Of course there are some obvious problems with this but my reasoning lies in the fact that The Knights Templar was an order of knights intended to protect the peace and honor of the church in Europe and on ward much like The Nights Watch protects the 7 kingdoms from the horrors of beyond the wall. Am I getting somewhere with this? Or am I just thinking out my ass. Ignore this/sorry if this has already been brought up,5,0,False,default,,,,,

In season 2, while Dani was in her vision/dream state in Qarth, she was in the Capitol with the thrown room burnt down in ashes. It appeared to be snowing. 

In Season 3, when Bran touched the face-tree, he had a vision on where to go. Apart of that vision, we see the thrown room in ashes again. 

So my question is this,

Do the books explain what this meant? Does anyone know what happened for this to happen? Could his possibly happen in the end of the show its self? I mean, in Brans vision, he saw a dragon over Kings Landing. Is it related?",3,5,False,self,,,,,

Personally, I'll admit I cried far too much at Ygritte's death and I almost cried when Daenerys locked her dragons up. Of course, the brutality of the Red Wedding is up there. There's just so many.

But I think the most intense reaction I had was when Tyrion strangulated Shae and then killed his pops on the can. I was out of my seat roaring in approval like a diehard football fan whose team just scored the winning goal in the World Cup. I was so jacked you guys. Like, I was ready to fight people. The moment he walked in to his father's chambers and he saw her, a simple thought popped into my head: this wench must die.

I was not disappointed.

Primarily because it's reached the point where he **is** sticking to the tropes, in fact he's just doing the inversion of them, which is itself probably a trope. It's not even an 'anyone can die' or 'dropping like flies' trope, so much as it is 'actually that plot armour has knives on the inside' style.

My problem is that, as far as I can tell at least, the story *isn't* written with a 'anyone's potentially screwed!'. It's written with 'the good guys die'.

At least, more or less so. Yes, I know some notably bad guys kick the bucket, but it seems to be distinctly rare, and in the tv adaption at least far, far more emphasis is settled on building up a good story, a good character, getting them to the very, very, *very* brink of success...then dropping them like a rock. Bad guys die more or less when expected, if they die at all. Good guys *will* die, and will do so right when you're about to enjoy their victory.



I still love the books, show, and story. This is just starting to bum me out, it's becoming less of a shock twist and more of an annoyance with myself for enjoying a character because you can tell right from the outset which ones are going to die. Because it's just a tired 'invert the plot-armour' trope.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Nine years since the last winter? That's seems a lot, are their seasons/years not based on Earth's revolution and rotation around Sun? Or they live on a different planet? Also, how is the geography explained? I mean, Dothraki/Targaryen are seemingly in a desert, while Winterfell even in the far north seem like in a constant winter, so are those two in different continents or is weather just that crazy? 

I know these may seem like things that I should disregard, but it has been bugging me for a long time.

This part has nothing to do with my questions, but since I don't have anyone IRL to talk about the show, I have some thoughts I'd like to share with you guys. First, like I said, the show has a reputation of killing off characters (which isn't bad, but can sometimes be disheartening), but I really hope Arya, Jon Snow and Daenerys last longer than a season or two. I mean, I watched HBO's Boardwalk Empire and they kill a character I was very invested in after two seasons! Also, I found it almost unreal that the difference in age between actresses who play Arya and Sansa is a year and a half, I thought it was at least five or so years and I admit I had some very inappropriate thoughts about Sansa before I found out her age. Cersei Lannister is crazy hot though, and don't even get me started on Daenerys, but (from what I saw thus far) I don't think there is a need for an incest relationship between Cersei and brother (forgot his name) as their bond should already be strong enough as siblings.

2. Wait dor freeTV....
3.Buy the DVD/BluRay

Usually(like 99,99999% of the time) the DVD/BkuRay is available A LOT SOONER than freeTV airs a show or film. But now HBO did the biggest possible shit to a fan like me:
Air the fourth season GoT 3 months before the DVD is released. Season 4 in freeTV on January 13,2015. DVD realease : end of March 2015

He mentioned to me that he discovered a clean version of the first season where the explicit content has been cut. I'm trying to think of the impact that may have and whether the show would be even enjoyable. Specifically in regards to the first season, there are some scenes that are rather forgettable and could be cut without much consequence (Tyrion's first scene in the first episode comes to mind), but then there are all the scenes that take place in Littlefinger's brothel, or Daenerys' final scene with the dragons that I can't imagine being cut.

However, we are left in the dark about House Greyjoy and their kingsmoot. This leads me to believe that we will see the latter in season 6, concurrent with Asha being captured and meeting Theon at the end. It makes sense to spread these over a couple seasons to by time until TWoW is released and explore all the characters from these storylines that converge into Meereen.

How I see the new houses introduced and the seasons being broken down into:

**Season 5:**

- Introduction of Prince Doran Martell with Prince Oberyn's natural daughters, the Sand Snakes.
- Conflict with Doran being too slow to respond to the Red Viper's death. Ellaria ~ Arianne?
- Plot to crown Princess Myrcella and Areo Hotah nipping it in the bud.
- Dorne rejoicing over the ""Mountain's"" skull, with Jamie delivering it.
- Ending with Doran revealing that Quentyn Martell is being sent as envoy to Dany.

**Season 6**

- Death of Balon Greyjoy
- The turmoil of choosing a successor, with Asha making a big claim only to find out Euron is on his way.
- Kingsmoot and Euron's plan to wed and bed Dany.
- Asha runs away to Deepwood Motte.
- Victarion and Euron geting into rough seas with each other with Damphair instigating Victarion, rubbing salt on old wounds.
- Victarion scheming to get Dany for himself.
- Asha gets captured and meets with Reek, err, Theon at the end.

I think it will be much more condensed than that. Events of the Wall and KL with the rise and fall of Cersei will be focused in the next season, with a filler of Sansa's story at the Vale. How will Dany's story be told across these next couple of seasons? How will Aegon be handled?

To start, you would choose which house you'd be in, and that would dictate which part of westeros/essos you would start off in. So if you choose to be part of the starks you'd start in winterfell, lannister in kings landing, greyjoy in the iron islands, etc. Each house would have its perks, so starks could get direwolves, targaryens could get dragons, and so forth. Each city would have vendors, similar to skyrim, and there could be purchasable properties. If you were caught doing crimes, you could be sent to the wall, or executed depending on how major it was. The only issue with being sent to the wall is that, if it's to be consistent with the universe, you'd have to stay there for the rest of the game, which could anger/bore some players. Now, i think it would work best if this wasn't set in the same universe as the HBO series, so because of this, you could prevent the starks from getting slaughtered, or help the freys and lannisters to slaughter them. You could choose to be an honorable or deceiving person, but the overall goal was to become king and sit on the iron throne.

I really think that this could be a good idea, so if anyone has any other ideas that could work in this game, feel free to comment.

Sure, Tactics shares the ""Final Fantasy"" brand which is certainly NOT synonymous with ""fascinating story"", yet this game is actually a black sheep. 

[Keep in mind I'm no fan of the gameplay, I'm strickly speaking of the plot, dialogues and music.]

So yeah, both FFT and GofT are similar in themes as their plot portrays countless murders, secondary characters, conspiracies, revolts and backstabbings in a medieval-fantasy setting. Yet, I was much more enthralled by FFT's plot progression. It's hard to explain without spoiling anything but the plot is ""tighter"", focusing strongly on 3-4 characters with all their own musical leitmotivs ; seventy-five minutes of FFT's plot uncovers a lot more of events than the equivalent in GofT.

Anybody here actually sat through FFT and GofT's stories ? Your opinion would be frankly appreciated ! I don't care about spoilers, I've always been fine with them.

So, I don't know about everyone else, but I have a running list of who I want dead in the GoT show(I've never read the books). I would like to share mine and ask for your's.

6. Myren trant - He killed the sword dancer and helped Cersei in Tyrion's trial
5. Stannis Baratheon - Stanis is a jerk who somehow became more of a jerk after letting himself be manipulated by the red woman. Not to mention his ""magic"" might have gotten Rob killed. Even still, he is in the way of the throne for the one true king, Tyrion Lannister.
4. The Mountain - He's been the cause of many cool characters deaths and raped that one prince's sister and helped Cerci with Tyrion's trial and burned the Hound
3. The Red Woman - Manipulator, liar, mother of demons, need I say more. Even her face makes me want to punch her.
2.Walter Frey - He freaking handed the war to the Lannisters on a silver plater and who makes someone marry there daughter just so that someone wants to cross a bridge.
1. Cersei Borathan - There isn't enough room.

The list once was bigger, but you either win or you die in the Game of Thrones. So, do you guys have a kill list?",5,0,False,default,,,,,

It's such a weird, fucked up, thrilling and funny tv-series. On the same time it contains lots of different messages to the viewer, it's really making you want to see more ( Lots of plot twist) and it makes me really exciting.
I can't wait to spend my holidays watching the whole series. After that I'll probable read the books.
Such a good way to start christmas having a new series to watch... That I actually find enjoyable ;)

I had a few thoughts;
Bronn looks to be very handy with a bow during the battle of blackwater
Anguy (the archer from the brotherhood) is obviously very skilled from when he taunts hot pie
Khal Drogo, the dothraki are often credited with being excellent archers, often mentioned how they learn to shoot on horseback, and Drogo is the best warrior of any dothraki so makes sense
Theon Greyjoy, Maester Luwin talks about him as being a very talented archer and he demonstrates this when shooting the wildling who has Bran
Just a few ideas probably missed someone obvious but idk who does everyone else think is the best archer in Westeros and why?:)",10,1,False,self,,,,,
