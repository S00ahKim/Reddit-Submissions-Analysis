My now-ex girlfriend is the one who introduced me to GoT and I blew through the available books as fast as possible. However, while I was still about halfway through GoT, she had a special birthday dinner which we planned to follow up with a full night of sex. 

Things went pretty well, and we had a great night, but whenever we switched into doggy-style I would chuckle a little to myself. This was messing the mood up for her, so she finally asked me what I was laughing about. I was hesistant to answer at first, but I finally admitted that all I could think about was how Khal Drogo insisted on doggy style because that was how the Dothraki got things done. This being an absurdly nerdy thing to think mid-sex, we both laughed a bit about it and moved on with our night. I thought that was the end of it.

However, next time we were having sex and I turned her over for doggy, she yelled ""LIKE THE DOTHRAKI!"" and CONTINUED TO DO THAT EVERY TIME WE HAD SEX.

Basically I had to abandon the position in order to take sex seriously, but it was almost funny enough to be worth it

**TL;DR ex-girlfriend yelled out ""LIKE THE DOTHRAKI!"" during doggy style.**

* Bran's fall
* Lady's execution
* Capturing of Tyrion
* Jaime attacking Ned (not the easiest to predict, but still a big moment)
* Golden Crown (no doubter)
* LF's Betrayal of Ned
* Ned's Death (no doubter)
* Birth of Dragons (no doubter)

That leaves out only 2 episodes, ep3 (Arya meets Syrio) and ep8 (Selmy dismissed followed by Sansa begging for Ned's life), which would have been pretty tough to predict.

So what are we thinking for season 2?  A few guesses:

* Cressen's vain sacrifice
* Arya's escape/Yoren's death
* Shadow baby! (2nd one, birthing scene)
* Lommy's death (not the most important character, but Arya seeing another child being run through could be a big moment)
* First Jaqen murder (what can I say, it's an Arya-heavy book)
* House of the Undying (one prolonged scene to end the episode is my guess)
* Pod saving Tyrion
* Burning of Winterfell (these last 2 probably can't both be done as they will likely both be in episode 9)

Season ender is a toss up for me between the reveal of Bran and Rickon or the 3 horn blows.  I think the latter is a long shot, because only certain stuff from ASoS will be moved forward, but it is my personal favorite.  Other stuff I think that could finish the season different from where the books do (but not be the episode ender):

* Jaime's hand goes bye-bye (moved up)
* Tyrion probably goes a little further into his recovery, maybe his conversation with Tywin.


A few ""big"" moments I don't think will be enders:

* Renly's death.  Too much needs to happen immediately after for it to have the suddenness necessary for an death-centric ender.
* Robb's infidelity. I think this will be shown since they cast a Jeyne, and even though it is a big deal for him to break his promise, the true impact is felt more retroactively.
* Arya's capture.  They have to kill Lommy right after, and I don't think they would start the next episode with child death.
* Anything to do with the ""deaths"" of Bran and Rickon (other than the reveal that they aren't).  Maybe I'm wrong here, I just don't see how a faked death can be shown for impact.
* Assassination attempt on Dany.  We've got to meet Arstan afterward.

Turn back now if you haven't read affc.

First off, let me say that I liked this more than I thought I would.  The consensus  seems to be that this book sucked, but there was a lot to like.  All sorts of crazy shit going on, though mostly at the end.

For example: Arya getting blinded, Brienne getting hanged (seemingly), Cercie finally getting what she deserves (I think her chapters were my favorite - she's such a scheming bitch), and finally Jamie turning his back on Cercie's plight (maybe - that's how I interpreted it).

I love that the Martells have a plan, and so does Littlefinger.  I loved that the Ironborne end up attacking the shit out of everything, too.

Anyway, a few questions:

Who the hell is Egg?  Maester Aemon kept calling out for him before he died.

Robb Stark's wife.  There was a Jamie chapter that made it clear that the wife's mother was conspiring with Tywin to murder the Starks.  Was the marriage a sham from the beginning?

edit 2&gt; New question: Why was Maester Pycelle was giving Tommen's wife Margaery moon tea? ..or will that be answered in ADWD?

Why the hate for this book?  I missed Tyrion and Dany and Stannis and The Wall too, but some world building needed to be done.  Every book has world building and they needed to mop up after the mess from ASoS.

I'm going to wait a couple of days before I start ADWD to let this all digest, but I'm looking forward to it.

* Hair - There's a theater costume shop nearby that has lots of great wigs and I think I'll be able to find a good platinum blond wig there (I hope).
* Clothing - This seems to be the trickiest part. The only costume I can find in still shots online is this [burlap-looking one](http://images.wikia.com/gameofthrones/images/e/e3/Daenerys_Targaryen.jpg) and this [gorgeous dress](http://www.gameofthrones.tv/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Game-of-Thrones-Daenerys-Targaryen%E2%80%99s-Costume-at-WonderCon.jpg).

I just don't know how to make or acquire a dress like that. **I'd also love any screenshots anyone can find of other outfits that Dany wears.**
* Props - I originally thought of having [GoT Spoiler](/s ""a little dragon perched on my shoulder""), and I'm still amenable to that idea (though it's a bit [GoT Spoiler](/s ""anachronistic unless I'm naked and bald - which, no"")).

what happens most times is that you can find spoilers in the very first paragraph or just reading the wrong word  while scrolling can spoil a big part of the books. this recently happen to me when i tried to find out more about ""Arstan"" (the oldest squire ;) )  and the link send me directly to a spoiler.

My rationale for the alignment placements is like this:

* Lawful/Chaotic - Does the character have a set of life rules they follow?  Are they keeping things together or tearing things apart?  Are their actions somewhat random? 
* Good/Evil - Does the character try to preserve life or kill easily without remorse?
* Player/Pawn (previously Smart/Stupid) - Does the character generally make good decisions? Do they control their own fate and/or manipulate others or are they controlled, managed, and/or manipulated by others?  When thinking of this, include cunning and wisdom, and whether the character's plans work or not.

With characters who change a lot, I tried to slot them in a way that seemed to reflect the ""average"" for the character.  So what do you think?  Where would you place the characters?

    Lawful  Good    Player Barristan Selmy, Doran Martell
    Lawful  Good    Piece  Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth
    Lawful  Good    Pawn   Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn
    Neutral Good    Player Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly
    Neutral Good    Piece  Robb Stark, Bran Stark
    Neutral Good    Pawn   Daenerys Targaryen, Thoros of Myr
    Chaotic Good    Player Beric Dondarrion, Syrio Forel
    Chaotic Good    Piece  Jorah Mormont, Ygritte
    Chaotic Good    Pawn   Catelyn Tully, Edmure Tully
    Lawful  Neutral Player Varys, Brynden Tully
    Lawful  Neutral Piece  Loras Tyrell, Davos Seaworth
    Lawful  Neutral Pawn   Stannis Baratheon, Kevan Lannister
    Neutral Neutral Player Tyrion Lannister, Jaqen H'ghar

Chapter 3 of GoT, Dany's first chapter, she mentions that she remembered her wetnurse living with them in Braavos. Now as far as I can recall, this character is never mentioned again, or am I forgetting something?

Theory: Dany's wetnurse is Jon Snow's mother (whomever she may be). In GoT Jon is identified as 14 years old, and Dany 13, meaning that Jon's mother would've been lactating when Dany was born. Of course, it was Edric Dayne's talk about Wylla that got me thinking this.

moving on to ASOS [spoilers for AGOT and ACOK]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/l9a0h/just_finished_reading_acok_just_want_to_talk/,Watanabex,1318399794,"ok so I finished reading this on sunday night and decided to take a couple of days off from reading to think about all that happenned and get ready for ASOS.

Here are my thoughts on A Clash of Kings:

About Stannis and friends:
* Stannis: I guess I was expecting more of him, we only hear from him in the prologue and then when Catelyn tries to get him and Renly to make peace and  team up against the Lannisters, then at the end at the Blackwater Rush, and we don't really know what happenned to him. I hope theres some closure for him in the next books.

* Melissandre, awesome and creepy character I pictured her as Christina Hendricks :P but I like who they've cast for the role, I also imagined her with a russian Natasha like accent I don't know why. The most WTF moment was when she gave birth to shadow stannis under Storms End, I can't wait to see that in the series.

* Davos, I loved Davos his story it's kjind of tragic, he's just doing his job serving his lord, his sons are moving on up, and then BAM! Blackwater Rush happenned, I hope he survives and theres more of him in the next books, and I'm pretty sure his sons are dead :(

* Renly, his death was so shocking I literally put down the book and said ""What the Fuck?"", I was expecting him to die in battle not by some sneaky magic.

Folks at Kings Landing:
* Sansa, poor poor Sansa, I really like her character I know lots of people hate her but shes just a sweet girl thrown into a pile of shit, I hope she gets to escape with Ser Dontos

* Joffrey, he trully is a little shit! stapling antlers to dead traitors and throwing them to Stannis' camp from a catapult, that is so fucked up, everytime he gets someone to hit Sansa my rage for him grows, can't wait to read his demise.

* Cersei, her line ""drink your Queen commands it"" was just so bad ass I loved that part, she's a bitch but really she's just trying to look out for herself and her family, well except for Tyrion. I didn't find myself hating her so much in this book.

* Varys and Little Finger were ok, just doing their thang, Maester Pycelle got owned, I missed Little Finger, I hope theres more of him in the following books.

* Jayne Poole I want to say that I was so depressed for this poor girl, did she get sold into prostitution? because that's what I got from her, I'm not sure if its at the end of AGOT or in ACOK but Little Finger takes her in, after Cersei takes her away from Sansa, I got the feeling that she's in some brothel know getting whored out by Little finger, I'm probably wrong about this, but thats the feeling I got and it made me sad.

* Tyrion, he wins the Bad Ass Motherfucker award in this book, he was awesome and heroic and a smart ass, and it's tragic that he was not honored at all at the Ceremony after the Blackwater rush battle. I have no idea what Tyrion is going to do in the next books, I doubt he's going to just live at Kings Landing, maybe he'll travel and have some adventures, I have no idea.

Arya and her Crew:

* Whispering Valar Morghulis as she slits the guards throat sent a shiver down my spine, completelly bad ass! and the Weasel soup, that was awesome, I hope Gendry and Hot Pie don't fuck thing up for her again. 

* Jaquen H'ghar, was not expecting him to transform into someone else at all, [Speculation](/? ""I can see where the Syrio = Jaquen theories come from""), his character is a total bad ass, too bad he was in the book for such a short time.

Other Lannister men:

* fuck them, I hope they die

King in the North crew:

* so Robb did some cool things but we don't get any details, that sucks, but I'm glad he's winning lots of battles, but shit will probably hit the fan in the next book, fighting against the Greyjoys and Reeks people and the Lannisters

* Catelynn, I hated that she stayed with her dying father instead of going to her young sons, what a stupid thing to do, but then at the end I felt sorry for her, then I got pissed when she said ""Brienne my sword"" Jaime is going to wrestle it away from her and escape, I just know it.

Jon and the MiB:
* Jons story was not really boring just not as exciting as Aryas or Tyrions, I like that he's a warg now too, Then at the end when he has to kill Qhorin that was so emotional and awesome Qhorin was a true hero. [Speculation](/? ""I also support the R+L=J theories, it makes sense, Ned kept the secret of his sisters dishonor at the hand of Rhaegar, so Jon is going to end up being the true king by the end of the series."")


Daenerys:

* Her burning down the house of the undying was the only cool thing about her story, I can't wait until Cersei and the council hear about her dragons. The predictions she saw in the house of the undying were so cryptic I wonder if they're foreshadowing anything? 

Winterfell:

* so heartbreaking, everyone dies, Palla gets raped, Beth Cassel probably got raped as well, how horrible. the castle is burnt down and abandoned. 

* Theon pissed me off incredibly he just fucked up in the most awful way, and then got taken as a prisoner of Reek right? Then again I feel sorry for him he was made fun of and humiliated and ignored by his family, he's just all alone, serves him right for being a dumbass.

* Bran and the Reeds, I can't wait to read more about them, and their adventures up north (they went north right?) some freaky shit is going to happen in the next books I can feel it!

This never ever gets remarked or commented on for the rest of the series. Is Martin trying to get everyone to forget that Robb signed Snow as the king of the north, and now that Snow's ""watch has ended"" that he is free to take the throne of the North!? Basically, since the men of the watch murdered him, his watch is over and he is free to leave the nights watch, and I am guessing that someone will approach Snow and say ""hey look at this dude, your brother Robb declared you heir, which all the readers forgot about... which makes you THE KING OF THE NORTH, THE KING OF THE NORTH!

Victarion Greyjoy has a Ghiscari captain's tongue ripped out merely for saying Daenarys was dead, and then drowns him.  Theon has turned up at the feet of Asha Greyjoy a skeletal wreck.  The Boltons are the Boltons and the Freys are the Freys.  Daenarys herself is 'putting the question' to those she merely suspects... and so on, and so on and so on.

So I propose **a summary/guide of where they all are and what they're up to** (w/as little speculation as possible) as per the ending of aDwD. Hope it helps others as well. I'll start:

*(please correct me and feel free to add)*

**Daenerys: **
With Drogon in the Dothraki sea. Met face to face w/Khal Jhoqo.

**Tyrion: ** Joined the 2nd Sons commanded by 

**Brown Ben Plumm:** who is now with the anti-Mereen army. With him is also

**Jorah Mormont:** Who's beat up, but still ok and wants to be with Dany

**Jon Snow:** *(arguably)* dead. Or at least stabbed 4 times by his brothers of the Watch.

**Melisandre:** Chillin' at the wall.

**Stannis:** *Said to be* dead in a letter from 

**Ramsay Bolton:** Who claims to be now lord of Winterfell and have Lightbringer and

**Mance Rayder:** *Said to be* the captive of Ramsay Bolton.

**Theon Greyjoy:** With help of (forgothisname) Umber and (forgothisname) of the Iron Bank of Braavos reunited with

**Asha Greyjoy:** Who was the captive of Stannis. So her fate depends on wtv happened to him.

**Euron Greyjoy:** ruling the Iron Island I guess. Waiting for Daenerys to be brought to him by

**Victarion Greyjoy:** With a bit &gt;1/2 of his Iron Fleet sailing the straits to Meeren to get Dany for himself.

**Ser Barristan:** Now Hand of the missing Queen and head of her council. With the city under attack from the anti-Mereen coalition's trebuchets.

**Arya:** Just got promoted to acolyte in the temple of the God of Many Faces.

**Sansa/Alayne:** In the Vale of Arryn, to be married to the heir of the Vale by her fake father

**Littlefinger:** who's now kind of ruling the Vale.

**Cersei:** Shaven and shamed but back to the Red Keep to be with her son

**Tommen:** Who's still sitting the Iron Throne and is still married to

**Margaery Tyrell:** who is about to face a trial by the Faith for all the crap Cersei made up about her.

**Ser Loras Tyrell:** is on Dragonstone, badly wounded (not dead by any accounts).

**Mace Tyrell:** is now Hand of King Tommen and has the support of

**Randyl Tarly:** who is hanging at Kings Landing with his army after being done with Maidenpool

**Qyburn:** Still around the Red Keep with his creation

**Robert Strong:** *(pretty much explained to be)* A Franken-Knight raised from the corpse of The Mountain.

**Catelyn/Stoneheart:** At large.

**Jamie:** After settling the Bracken/Blackwood dispute was intercepted in the road by

**Brienne:** who was last seen about to be hanged by Stoneheart and her ilk but said ""one word"" (...and that was left at that)

**Podrick** was also about to be hanged w/Brienne.

**Bran:** Way far beyond the Wall being taught to be a greenseer by the last of the greenseers. Living w/some children of the forest with **Jojen &amp; Meera Reed** and

**Hodor:** Hodor.

**Coldhands** who is lurking outside Bran's cave.

**Varys:** At large. Last seen in the Red Keep. Killed **Kevan Lannister** with the help of some children w/daggers.

**Samwell Tarly** Met up with some maester apprentices in Oldtown and (I think) was going to set sail to find Daenerys.

**Davos:** On his way to ~~a place with cannibals~~ Skaagos by orders of Lord Manderly to fetch

**Rickon Stark:** who was last seen at the freaking end of Clash with **Osha.**

**Edric Storm:** was sent across the narrow sea by Davos.

**Gendry:** Blacksmithing for Stoneheart &amp; co. as far as we know *(right?)*

**Jon Connington:** Poised to take Storm's End to be used as a base of operations for

**Aegon Targaryen:** *(allegedly)* who has the Golden Company at his back to retake Westeros

I have been assigned a project over a novel of my choice, as long as it meets criteria, for example, length + difficulty + setting + character interaction. I chose Game of Thrones for obvious reasons. Gotta say, loved it. So the project is a little bit about the events in the book, but more-so content that you create. You become a character of your choosing and you put them in a setting that they can reflect about the book. A popular choice is psychiatrist so they can talk a lot about what happened. I don't think I can do that for game of thrones. I'm actually still deciding of what I'm going to do. Here's a couple of my ideas, and hopefully you guys will give your opinion.

Character ~~~~ Theme

Lord Eddard Stark [dead... hmmm] - maybe as an old man telling either his children or a personal assistant  what it was like being in a ""game of thrones"" as if he was alive.

Daenerys [weird, because I am a guy] - I could pull a herman cain and talk as if i accomplished my goal, or rather just talk about my experiences with the dothraki

Jon Snow - What its like making the oath and becoming a servant to the wall. Talk about the wall + being a bastard- with who i wonder...

Bran [Age?] - Must avoid talking about twincest. Perhaps recovery + plot to kill him. maybe with his family or an advisor or something.

Arya [Age?] - .... would talk about my family + running away + being a tomboy -  dont know exactly who with.

That's all I really have thought of so far. Would love to hear what the people of r/gameofthrones has to say.

Thanks for reading.",13,6,False,default,,,,,

After many fruitless searches, I decided to create my own. A friend and I have played a handful of games of this and it seems to work and is fun, so I thought I'd share with you guys. Call it open Beta. Now, I did take some liberties with making the board hexagonal when the books clearly mention squares, I hope you'll forgive me. The game of thrones card game took similar liberties by picturing cyvasse played on a round board, so I'm not alone.

**Setup**
The game is played on a Hexagonal board with 6 hexes to a side. This adds up to a total of 91 spaces on the board. Before the game begins, a curtain is placed in the middle row of the board to prevent players from seeing their opponent's side of the board. You then place your pieces on your half of the board in secret.

**Pieces**
Each player starts with the following pieces

6 Mountains: Stationary, Impassable by most pieces

1 King: Strength 1

1 Dragon: Strength 6, can fly over mountains

2 Elephant: Strength 5; Moves 2

2 Heavy Horse: Strength 4

2 Light Horse: Strength 3

2 Trebuchet: Strength 2; Moves 5 in straight line; Trumps Dragon, may fly over a single piece or mountain when capturing a piece

2 Crossbowman: Strength 2

4 Spearman: Strength 1, Trumps Light Horse and Heavy Horse

4 Rabble: Strength 1

**Movement**
Unless otherwise stated, a piece may move up to a number of spaces equal to their strength. They may not move through any spaces already containing a piece.

**Capturing Pieces**
You may only capture a piece by using a piece with equal or higher strength, except in the case of Trumps. Any piece capable of trumping another piece may capture that piece without aid regardless of strength.

**Flanking**
You may add the strength of any pieces you have adjacent to an opponent's piece to the Strength of the piece you use to try and capture it.

**Winning**
You win the game by capturing the opponent's King. You must declare anytime your pieces threaten your opponent's King, giving them a chance to prevent capture.

You also win the game if you are able to capture all of your opponent's pieces other than their King, leaving them defenseless and without a kingdom.",6,9,False,default,,,,,

It said:

""I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye. I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings. I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, *oh*, I woke from terror.""

When I finished ASOS, I looked back to see if this was true and realized that the first part refers to the shadow killing Renly and the last part refers to Catelyn dying and coming back to life in the epilogue. 

Now, reading A Feast for Crows I realized that Balon Greyjoy is the one who died falling from a swinging bridge. If that part of the prophecy is true, which I can only assume based on the other parts coming true, did Aeron Damphair hire a faceless man to assassinate Balon? If so, what are his motivations for doing so? I haven't yet gotten to the Kingsmoot, so perhaps they will be revealed there?

I just thought it was interesting that a prophecy from so earlier, which is dismissed by the characters at the time, has turned out to be so accurate.

If you've only seen the show or read A Game of Thrones, stop here. :D**

Okay, so this has been bothering me.

In A Game of Thrones, Ned is given a **badge** in the shape of an ""ornate silver hand"" as his insignia of office.  I used my Kindle to check - it's mentioned 5 separate times as a badge ([Eddard VI](http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/028/index.html), [Eddard VIII](http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/034/index.html), [Eddard X](http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/040/index.html), [Eddard XI](http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/044/index.html), and [Eddard XIII](http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/048/index.html)).  And in the TV show, it's also a very prominent pin ([see the screen shot](http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Gallery/Entry/2706/)).

However, it's never referred to again.  From ACoK onward, The Hand of the King wears a **chain** of office, which is never mentioned in AGoT.  And it's not explained as a change in the insignia of the office; Pod dresses Tyrion ([Tyrion III](http://towerofthehand.com/books/102/016/index.html)) and simply offers him ""your chain.  The Hand's chain.""  There's nothing to say that Tyrion had this made - this is simply the chain of office that The Hand wears.  It is subsequently mentioned several times as Tyrion wears it throughout the book.

I'd have passed this off as Lannisters making something in gold, but in ASoS, Jaime tells Brienne the story of Aerys ([Jaime V](http://towerofthehand.com/books/103/038/index.html)), and he specifically mentions the chain of office - that one Hand ""took of his chain of office and flung it down on the floor."" And then that Aerys ""hung [the] chain about the neck of Rossart, his favorite pyromancer.""  

So if the chain of linked gold hands is the symbol of the office of The Hand of the King, why on earth is so much made of the silver hand badge in the first book?  My Google-Fu is not strong tonight - has G.R.R.M. ever discussed this?",11,9,False,self,,,,,

So distinct were his characterizations that he was initially offered the role of Grand Meister Pycelle, although he had to withdraw due to medical reasons. He is, apparently, playing Pyromancer Hallyne now, though.

A Feast for Crows, however, was narrated instead by one John Lee. His name makes it difficult to research his acting credentials, but his performance is *remarkably* different - not only do characters have vastly different speaking styles, the pronunciation of many character and place names is changed. For example, Dotrice consistently pronounced ""Petyr"" to almost rhyme with ""on fire,"" whereas Lee pronounces it indistinguishably from ""Peter.""

Granted, Lee's pronunciations are more in line with HBO's [official pronunciation guide](http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2011/2/11/official-pronunciation-guide-for-game-of-thrones.html), Dotrice's absence from the fourth audiobook is likely due to the same health issues which kept him from playing Pycelle, but some of the themes in AFfC got me thinking: What if there's also an in-universe explanation?

(The theory proper begins here)

One of the recurring themes in AFfC is a certain degree of doubt and uncertainty regarding the true history of the Seven Kingdoms. In fact, in a shout-out to Robert Jordan, Maester Rigney even mentions the possibility that their history might be looping back on itself.

What if these changed pronunciations are not simply due to an inconsistency in production notes? What if AFfC (or, at least, its audiobook version) is a later cycle of the events described, with the names subtly corrupted over time?

BUT I do have some favorite chapters and some less-than-favorite chapters. 

Favorites: Any Tyrion, Arya, Jaime or Danerys chapter. Tyrion chapters for the court intrigue and the whole rooting-for-the-misunderstood-underdog thing. 

It's VERY interesting to see what Arya is becoming. Might she turn into the first Faceless Woman? I just read the chapter where the dwarf lady is afraid of her and tells her ""Begone!"" Or is she just a confused little girl, consumed with thoughts of revenge?

The Jaime chapters are just WOW! I love getting the whole backstory on that guy. Obviously he's still pretty despicable for throwing Bran out the window, but these chapters have given us some more feeling for the guy. I was really surprised to find out he's never been with a woman besides Cersei. And given the way Cersei seems to have manipulated him into joining the Kingsguard for her own selfish interests, can't we have just a little bit of pity for the jerk? Also, he shows a bit of chivalry in going back for Brienne at Harrenhal. It's got me thinking that House Lannister has a lot of potential, if only they could get rid of Lord Tywin and Cersei. Imagine Lord Jaime at Casterly Rock (sans Cersei) and Tyrion happily living with Shae, unmolested by the fierce Tywin... they could be... good?

Danerys of course because it's through her that we get to explore the world outside Westeros. And some CRAAAZY shit happens - I did not predict her becoming a heroic slave emancipator!

Least favorite are pretty much any Catelyn chapters. Catelyn's character is the dutiful wife/mother/queen, and it's hard to root for her after she frees Jaime. Sometimes it seems like her chapters exist just so we can see what's happening with Robb.

I wasn't sure how to phrase it in the title without spoiling anything, so I left it vague.

SPOILER ALERT~!

During the red wedding, the guy who kills Catelyn says something like ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards"". I am confused why he said that, as Jaime wasn't part of that plan and I'm not even sure he was back home yet. This, of course, completely fucks over Brienne when she meets Lady Stoneheart and she thinks Brienne is working with Jaime, who, of course, Catelyn thinks had her and her son killed.

I find it hard to reconcile the fact that the murderer said it just for effect, while it had such lasting consequences in book 4. Or did Jaime actually have something to do with it?

Maybe I'm missing something.

Honestly, though, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the best book I've ever read. I've never had a book make me feel as many emotions as this one has, even if some of them were rage. The start is a little slow, I guess, but the middle and end are so incredible. Dany's conquest of the Free Cities is such remarkable character development; the Astapor chapter may be one of the best in the first 3 books. I don't want to gush forever, but the Red Wedding and subsequent ""revivals"" of Arya and Cat actually made me scream. More and more of the fantasy elements are emerging (the warg-ness of the Starks and Jon, Lord Beric's refusal to die (and Cat's, now, I suppose),  etc.). And as this is the 3rd book it really seems like the overarching plot of the series is really emerging and I'm starting to understand where ASOIAF comes from.

So what I'm really curious to know is does the series drop off after this one? Heck, do you guys even agree that ASoS is one of the better books? I'm just so excited for the rest of the series, I want to know what I'm headed for.",11,2,False,self,,,,,

1) The Battle on the Fist of the First Men. The first real glimpse of the Others and their true strength. Also, Samwell Tarly taking his balls out of his purse and being a goddamned hero.

2) Dany and Drogon pwning the Astapori slavers. I was re-reading that scene on the bus today and had to work really hard to keep from crying at the awesomeness.

3) The House of the Undying. So far the show has stayed away from the dreams, visions, and flashbacks that are so common in the books, but this one is kind of a major plotpoint so I really hope they do it justice, especially the bits that hint about [well known fan theory](/? ""Rhaegar and Lyanna being Jon Snow's true parents."")

4) The Red Wedding. It's the fan reactions to this that I can't wait to see. All my friends who hadn't read the books were SHOCKED by Ned's death. I think someone may break a TV when Robb and Grey Wind get snuffed. Plus I think Zombie Catelyn will be a great moment to end the season.

5) Joffrey's death. I just hate that little inbred fuck. This is a scene I will probably watch on repeat.

The [Spoiler Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hvg3r/spoiler_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) received a fairly extensive rewrite, while the [Posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hxu9c/posting_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) and [Banning Policies](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/i2wyh/banning_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) had only small edits.  The day-to-day moderation details have for the most part not changed; the majority of the edits were clarity and simplification fixes. 

The Posting Policy does have one important new addition: **""Discussion or depiction of any events from the show or books must not encourage the harm of minors or sexually objectify the actors or characters.""** We have become concerned by the increasing number of posts dealing with sex and minors.  They've ranged from graphic depictions of actual sex to photos of naked young girls who look similar to underage actors in the show.  We're not allowing that any more.  

The idea of free speech and expression has been a pretty strong facet of /r/gameofthrones for as long as I've managed it.  The subreddit was set up to be just GRRM-focused and spoiler-safe, where most anything else is fine and managed by up/down voting.  But the sex-focused posts at best were disrespecting the actors, and at worst were threatening to turn the subreddit into another /r/jailbait. 

Yes, we understand the series is filled with sex, and often with minors, incest, or rape involved.  But there is a difference between the discussion of story events, academically in context, and the promotion of those events for the real world.  So as a result we've unanimously decided to add this new content limitation in an effort to curb the questionable content and maintain this as a respectful, legal, and welcome subreddit for any GRRM fans.  

We encourage you all to read through the new policies and [send the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23gameofthrones) any feedback you'd like to give.  ",110,123,False,self,,,,,

How much oversight did GRRM have over the TV show? Because, for example, there are scenes like [TV Spoiler](/s ""Ned Stark vs. Jaime Lannister where the show leads us to believe they are pretty evenly matched in combat, but the books don't give us much insight into Ned's skill, and indicate Jaime to be one of the best in Westeros. If I remember correctly, Jaime even estimates that he could have beaten Robert in his prime, even though Robert was stronger. The implications of an even Ned vs. Jaime fight are that either Jaime isn't as tough as he thinks he is, or Ned is a bona fide badass with a sword, even in his older-age."")

If GRRM reviewed this scene and had the ability to veto it, but chose not to, then that must mean that he has no creative qualm with the scenario, meaning that even though it didn't happen in the book, it fits in with the ASOIAF universe that he created. And this goes for all the other scenes in the TV show, as well.

(NOTE: It's been a while since I read about the history behind it, so I used wiki to help me out a bit. So it will look a bit...splotchy. And unfortunately, I cannot seem to locate the title of the book at the moment, but I can probably find it the next time I head to the library.)

Boris Godunov was a nobleman in Russia during during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. Upon his death, Ivan appointed Godunov to head a regent council to guide his son Feodor, who would become Tzar Feodor I. Additionally, Ivan left another son, Dmitri Ivanovich who was of his seventh marriage, and not recognized as a legitimate heir to the throne since the Russian Orthodox Church only recognized the first three. 

Upon his ascent to the council, Ivan's three year old son and his mother were exiled a fair distance from Moscow. In 1591, at the age of ten, the young Dmitri was murdered by Godunov 's agents who made the death appear an accidental knife injury, and forced his mother to join a nunnery. 

upon his death, riots ensured throughout Moscow, as lynch mobs went after those who had carried out the vile task. 

Fast forward to 1600, we see the sudden appearance of a young man calling himself  Dimitrii Ioannovic,. claiming to be the Dmitri that had been murdered prior. In his own account, his own mother had anticipated the assassination and had sent Dmitri to be put in the care of a doctor, and would later move to to Poland where he would then reveal his ""true identity."" However, there had been many rumors that the man was actually a bastard son of the Polish King Stefan who wished turn Russia into a Catholic nation.

I know this inst the BEST description but anyways, is there a chance  that GRRM was inspired or influenced from these events, or is this all just one big coincidence?

The one thing that does deter me though, is that unlike Young Dmitri, Young Griff practices the faith of his supposed father and dopes not plan to change Westeros in that manner. The only known way that the two bare resemblance is in the fact that the two have been able to (or will, in Griff's case), rally support from their Homeland.

I was inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/l9a0h/just_finished_reading_acok_just_want_to_talk/) so I wanted to share my thoughts before moving on to AFFC tomorrow. Ive been quite good at keeping away from spoilers, and most of the ones I did see before getting to this point were from the first 3 books. 

**Thoughts in General**

* Okay, so I expected a LOT of deaths, as I've learned from the other books, but seriously...[ASOS minor spoiler](/b ""there were so many people I didn't expect to die!"") I know no character is safe with GRRM but still...
* Possibly my favourite book so far of the series. It was the longest so far, but didn't feel draggy except for a couple of plotlines (more on that later)
* I think I need a specific journal just for ASOIAF so I can write down things I may need to know later (e.g. [ASOS](/b ""the Ghost of High Heart tells Arya she sees a maid at a feast with purple serpents in their hair and venom dripping from their fangs, and also Lord Robert destroying Sansas Winterfell castle...I completely forgot about that womans dream until Joffrey and Margaery's wedding."")
* Does anyone else think of [this book series]( http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/67C97418*2460*45A1*884B*5D3B58E12BAA/0/seriesofunfortunateevents.jpg) every time you read [all books](/b ""a Stark character plotline? I meancome onArya ALMOST got reunited with her mother and brotherSO CLOSE. Same with Jon and Bran. And so many of them are dead now."") 

**Specific Plotlines/Characters**
* Kings Landing remains one of my favourite plotlines to follow, its always one of the most intriguing to me, perhaps because so many characters have intersected there. 

* Aryas storyline also continues to fascinate me. Shes one of my favourite characters, and the fact that she interacts with so many different people at different times makes it interesting. And I particularly liked [ASOS](/b ""the group of outlaws led by Lord Beric, theyre a good motley crew of characters."")

* Ive enjoyed seeing Sansa mature over the series. I didnt like her at all in AGOT, but after [AGOT](/b ""Ned was killed"") and [ACOK](/b ""her various interacts with the Lannisters and their household""), Ive liked her growing up and becoming less naive. She still does have that streak of oh a knight will rescue me, but its been good to see her wake up to the world around her. 

* This may be completely heartless but [ASOS](/b ""I was SO GLAD Joffrey was killed!!!! I hated him so much, though reading how he was killed by the Strangler was still painful, despite my hatred."")

* The revelations about [ASOS](/b ""Tysha (Tyrions first wife)"") were quite shocking. And the ensuing drama didnt surprise me at all, [ASOS](/b ""although it was ever so satisfying to watch Tyrion murder Tywin on the privy. The irony was so perfect. No gold in that shit"")

* I found myself not liking Jon's plotline much during this book. Every time I got to his POV chapter, I wanted to skip ahead. Perhaps it was just that the other storylines were more intriguing to me, I dunno.  I do have to say [ASOS](/b ""I liked the Ygritte/Jon storyline a lot, as it made Jons eventual decision to leave the wildlings all the harder."") I did like the addition of Samwell as a POV though, Ive always liked his character as I imagine I would be pretty afraid of a lot of the things hes afraid of. And his growth in this book was great. [ASOS](/b ""Especially when he killed the Other and hated the nickname Sam the Slayer."") 

* Is it just me, or did anyone else [ASOS](/b ""think of Inigo Montoya when Oberyn Martell was fighting the Mountain and saying You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children over and over again? I do wish Oberyn had lived, though, he would have been a very interesting character to keep around, but ah well."")

* I am liking Daenerys less and less as the series goes on. I think its great that shes taking a bit more charge of herself, but she still seems very headstrong and naive, which isnt the greatest combination for her.

*  Littlefinger manthat guyI have no words for his deviousness. 

* I really enjoyed the Jaime POV chapters, and [ASOS](/b ""his interactions with Brienne were so funny to read, even though he was such a jerk to her. And I liked that Briennes character was fleshed out more."")

* Lastly, [ASOS](/b ""it was INSANE to see Catelyn Stark alive againIm glad shes with Lord Beric now, and it will be nice to see this revenge plot against the Freys continue."")

**Speculations for AFFC/ADWD (since I heard some characters appear in one and some in the other)** 

* I expect that in Kings Landing, [Speculation](/g ""things will fall apart for Cersei and Tommen, and possibly some other Lannisters. My copy of ASOS had a Cersei POV chapter where she and Ser Kevan argue about a possible marriage for her and naming one of the Tyrell bannermen as Kings Hand, and things did not look like they were going to go well."")
* Going along with that, there will hopefully be a POV character out of House Martell, since I think they will play a big part in the next book. I would like a Myrcella POV, or perhaps one of the young Martell girls.
* At some point, since [Speculation](/g ""Bran, Meera, Jojen and Hodor are travelling north of the Wall, theyll probably be attacked by wights or the Others when they descend to fight the Wall."")
* Regarding the Greyjoys, [Speculation/spoiler](/g ""since Balon is dead, his brothers and children will have to stake a claim in his now-vacant throne. My guess is the throne will go to Asha, since Theon has apparently been flayed by Ramsay Bolton, though I dont know much about Balons brothers other than Damphair. That will be fun to watch."")
* At the Wall, [Speculation](/g ""I think Jon Snow will be a good Lord Commander, but there will be tensions between the Nights Watch and Stannis and Melisandre. I picture fighting between the two camps, and then the wights and Others descending on them. And Melisandre sucking in a few of the Night's Watch."")
* Across the Water, [Speculation](/g ""Daenerys will rule in Meereen, but eventually there will be some civil unrest and shell move on somewhere else. She will also start training her dragons for battle since theyll continue to get bigger. And she will regret her decision to send away Ser Jorah, and Ser Barristan will prove himself to be of great help to her."")
* With Sansa, my guess is [Speculation](/g ""she will somehow be involved in taking care of Lord Robert now that Lysa Arryn is dead, but that both will somehow become pawns for another devious Littlefinger scheme. And I hope Brienne finds her, but I think it more likely that Brienne will wander around for a while and get sidetracked into some other plotline."")
* Id really like to know what happens to [ACOK](/b ""Rickon and Osha, because they havent yet been mentioned and I really liked Osha, brief as her appearance was. I think Osha said she was travelling east to the kingsroad, so perhaps theyll end up near Moat Cailin and the Neck. I believe the ironborn hold Moat Cailin right now, so maybe theyll end up being captured by them."")
* I would love to see [Speculation](/g ""Tyrion meet up again with his men from the Mountains of the Moon. I dont think Littlefinger would kill him if he found him, as he already has a lordship - though with Littlefinger you never know. I quite liked Shagga, Timett, Chella and Ulf, and would like to know what happens to them. I dont think they would give him up either, although there isnt really any safe place for Tyrion. OOH maybe he ends up back at the Wall? I don't know if they would give him up."")
* Lastly, I think [Speculation](/g ""Arya will get to Braavos, and take more water dancing sword lessons from someone similar to Syrio Forel. Shell have to be taken in by someone or work, so a lot of new characters will be added as usual."")

Think that's it...excited to start Book 4 and continue this madness of kings, queens, Houses and killings! Also, apologies if I went overboard with the spoilers, I realize most of the text here is covered up.

*tl,dr:* I enjoyed Book 3 the best so far and am really stoked for the next book, and predict the major plotlines.

**Edit** Fixed text for some spoilers, somehow the formatting was weird. And spelling errors.

**Edit 2:** Realized the speculations tags got changed, so fixed those. They should be covered now.",53,14,False,self,,,,,

Official House words will always be first, but if a House has no words, and there's some quote from the books that's ""known"" to be said by that house, that I'll use that till something more official comes along.  For example: ""heh"" is currently the Words option for House Frey.

The Organizations and Other Groups also needs words, and real quotes from the books are preferred.  Any suggestions need to be short, ideally less than 6 words.  Longer quotes may be used if they are just really good.

If you haven't finished it, turn back now.





Ok, so I just finished reading about the battle for King's Landing, when it concludes with Ser Dontos explaining the battle to Sansa.  And I've discovered that for the last half of the book, GRRM is a real troll.

He leads you to believe that Theon kills Bran and Rickon and mounted their heads on spikes.  And then it goes on to say that they were really just heads of two random kids from the mill, skinned.  So Bran and Rickon aren't dead. Or perhaps they are, but their heads aren't on spikes at least.  But GRRM doesn't tell you that for like three chapters, leading me to have a lasting heart attack for three straight chapters.

Then he leads you to believe, from Davos's perspective, that Stannis is ultimately losing the battle at King's Landing, due to wildfire.  Then he switches sides and leads you to believe that Stannis has won. Also, Tyrion was betrayed by one of the Kingsgaurd, and then barely saved, but I don't know by whom (it hints at his squire).  Then GRRM fucking brings Renly back to life, whom for some reason decides to team up with Tyrin, and the Lannister's win King's Landing. 

Don't spoil anything after this point.  I don't know anything past what I mentioned above. The battle has just finished. 

So yeah.  GRRM ultimate troll. I mad. Just felt the need to vent. 

Edit: I finished.  Renly never came back in the first place.  What the fuck, Ser Dontos? 

And man, I'm pissed in King's Landing as well.  I was kinda rooting for the Lannister's for the sole sake of Tyrion and Sansa.  Well they win, but Tyrion isn't the Hand anymore.  I'm guessing all the credit he deserves for protecting the city will go to his dad. 

And what the fuck has Robb been doing all this time? He went and had a skirmish or too near Lannisport about halfway through the book but hasn't been heard from since.

Also, fuck Bolton, him at Harrenhall and him his bastard.  Burning Winterfell? Why the hell would you do that? He had plenty of men, he could have easily held it. 

Poor Maester Luwin :( 

Nothing good happened in this book. Only bad things. UGH",21,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm also taking the opportunity to dress as her before she's featured in the HBO series so I can work off my own interpretation of the character without people saying my costume is ""inaccurate."" I'm basing the costume off the descriptions of her from the books and the only detail I'm missing is the red eyes (1. Because it was too late to order contacts by the time I decided on the costume and 2. I HATE things being in or around my eyes.)

This is me in my first try with the complete costume:
http://moonlightvamp.deviantart.com/#/d4chkoy

Upon looking at this, I thought the costume could use a prop, so I decided to create a House Baratheon of Dragonstone (Stannis) banner to carry with me. As with the costume, I based the banner off the description in the book and the illustration of the sigil in the back of DwD to create the design (the difference between the two being the full bodied crowned stag of House Baratheon or just the stag's head.) Though I did make the decision to use the HBO version of the Baratheon stag for the center of the fiery heart. This photo shows the final paint job of the sigil on the banner:

As it stands, it doesn't really refer directly to the family, but rather it refers to a season that everyone experiences. 

My own theory is that there is actually a closer link with the Starks and winter, such that ""Winter is coming"" really means ""We (the Starks) are coming"".

Here is one course I can imagine them doing:

* Remove prologue.
* Remove dorne.
* Cut down Brienne to one chapter.
* Cut down iron men to three chapters: drowned priests, kingsmoot, raids
* Trim samwell whining.
* Embellish on Sansa. Show her learning the game by tricking littlefinger.

For readers, maybe, doing similar edits to dance with dragons, it would be possible to merge into one (awesome) book.

EDIT:

Is everyone incapable of thinking outside the box? I think people's abstraction skills are broken...

I think it is pretty obvious that when things have to be translated to screen, this WILL be drastically changed. It is best to discuss this, and, maybe the best ideas from the fans might help the producers. But putting your head in the sand, thinking everything is perfect isn't going to help...

The idea is to be aggressive. Push back is welcome. The best point I've seen so far is that you can't cut Dorne because it is important to book 5. Great point, but it doesn't change the ""fact"" that the presentation of the material is boring as hell. Maybe the screen might do better justice, dunno...

EDIT 2:

Also, binary thinking may not be the best approach here.  ""Remove X"", might just as well be rewrite and reshape X to emphasize only Y plot points.  Some of the weaker things of the books will be cut away as they merge into one story line (but spanning two seasons).",21,0,False,self,,,,,

After watch Spartacus Blood and Sand, I was looking for something else to watch. I ran into Game of Thrones by mistake, and holy crap was this one of the best mistakes I've ever made!!

I finished watching all 10 episodes of season 1 in 3 days. Right now, I've picked up the books and I started reading from book 1. I'm about half way through book 1 and soon I will start the second one but I have a question. Should I wait for season 2, watch it, and then read the book, or should I read the book first? What I liked about GoT season 1 was that it was like a 10 hour long movie. I was in suspense and was very eager to learn what will happen at many points of the story, such as Ned Stark's fate, and the outcome to Tyrion's trial etc. etc. If I had read the books, I wouldn't have had these ""thrillers"". But on the flipside, I guess watching the show in 3 days kinda ruined the book that I will be reading for another month as I know what will be happening, lol.

So for book 2 and season 2, what would you guys recommend?",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Even after all these years, Ser Barristan could still recall Asharas smile, the sound of her
laughter. He had only to close his eyes to see her, with her long dark hair tumbling about her shoulders
and those haunting purple eyes. Daenerys has the same eyes. Sometimes when the queen looked at
him, he felt as if he were looking at Asharas daughter 
But Asharas daughter had been stillborn, and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon
after, mad with grief for the child she had lost, and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at
Harrenhal as well. She died never knowing that Ser Barristan had loved her. How could she? He was a
knight of the Kingsguard, sworn to celibacy. No good could have come from telling her his feelings. No
good came from silence either. If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty,
might she have looked to me instead of Stark?

Doesn't this negate her chance of being Jon's Mother?  Wouldn't this mean that Ned's infidelity lead to a still birth and strikes her out as Jon's possible mother?
